The direction of policy and regulatory development indicates that sustainability reporting and fuel transition requirements will tighten further.","Air cargo is shifting to mandatory sustainability, with SAF, emissions reporting, and operational efficiency driving decarbonisation.

Digital tools, AI, and data systems are key for tracking, reporting, and optimising emissions across the supply chain.

Collaboration, benchmarking, and sustainability-linked finance are increasingly shaping investment, strategy, and industry-wide alignment.

Air cargo operators, forwarders, and supply chain partners are entering a more regulated sustainability environment, driven by new disclosure frameworks, emissions reporting rules, and industry-wide decarbonisation targets. Regulatory change is moving sustainability beyond voluntary commitments, with mandatory Scope 3 emissions reporting due to expand significantly under Corporate Sustainability Reporting (CSR) rules by 2027. At the same time, governments, financiers, and customers are applying pressure for measurable progress toward the sector’s goal of net zero by 2050, increasing the focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), operational efficiency, and data transparency.

Sustainability performance is becoming integrated into commercial decision-making. “Sustainability is becoming a factor of doing business,” said Glyn Hughes, Director General of The International Air Cargo Association (Tiaca).

“Regulators, financiers, customers, and employees are all looking for evidence that organisations understand and can demonstrate their environmental and social impact.”

Chris McDermott, Chief Executive at CHAMP, said sustainability reporting is influencing how companies evaluate technology and capital investment. “We are seeing more companies appoint senior roles dedicated to sustainability,” he said. “This is now tied to strategy, not only reporting.”

SAF pathways and the Net Zero commitment

SAF is expected to deliver the largest share of the air transport sector’s decarbonisation contribution over the next three decades. The International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) Long-Term Aspirational Goal and regional policies, including the European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, position SAF as the primary route to reducing aviation emissions while maintaining global freight capacity. ReFuelEU requires SAF blending to rise from minimal use today to 70 percent by 2050, representing a structural shift in how airlines procure and manage fuel.

However, the current availability of SAF remains limited. Production capacity is constrained, and costs remain between three and five times higher than conventional aviation fuel. Feedstock supply, certification processes, and regional policy mismatches further restrict scalability. “SAF currently costs three to five times more than conventional jet fuel, and expanding production requires significant capital investment,” said Arnaud Brolly, Founder and Chief Executive of Impact, which operates a marketplace for SAF certificates.

Forwarders and shippers are increasingly seeking SAF-based services to meet their own emissions reduction commitments. Leading logistics operators have introduced programmes allowing customers to purchase SAF-linked emission reductions for individual shipments. Several airlines have also expanded SAF purchase options at booking level. This is creating new commercial models in which both airlines and forwarders act as intermediaries between SAF producers and cargo customers.

Certification has become essential to prevent double counting and ensure emissions claims are auditable. SAF certificates decouple the environmental attribute of the fuel from its physical use, allowing airlines to claim Scope 1 reductions and shippers to claim Scope 3 reductions using the same verified emission savings within established accounting rules. CHAMP, for example, has supported customer reporting needs through data-backed documentation linked to its hydroelectric-powered data centres. “Customers need audited data to report emissions accurately,” said Marjorie Guerrero, Executive Assistant to the CEO and ESG Coordinator at CHAMP.

Operational efficiency, data systems, and technology integration

With SAF supply limited in the near term, carriers and cargo handlers are pursuing operational efficiency measures to reduce emissions intensity. Flight planning optimisation, improved aircraft weight and balance systems, and ground efficiency measures are delivering incremental reductions. Aircraft models continue to improve in efficiency, but fleet renewal cycles remain constrained by supply chain lead times and capital availability. Industry reports indicate that the global commercial fleet is ageing due to extended asset lifecycles and delivery backlogs.

Digitalisation is central to both emissions reduction and reporting readiness. Automated tracking, network planning optimisation, and sensor-based fleet management are enabling more accurate fuel burn measurement and resource allocation. Scope 3 reporting, in particular, requires standardised data exchange between airlines, forwarders, and shippers. Industry surveys show that data alignment remains a primary barrier to credible sustainability reporting. “Data collection and alignment across stakeholders is one of the areas where companies struggle most,” Hughes said.

Artificial intelligence and Internet of Things tools are being integrated to support predictive resource management, real-time visibility, and continuous emissions tracking. However, the increased use of data-intensive systems introduces energy sourcing implications. McDermott highlighted that digital infrastructure planning will have to integrate renewable power availability.

“Technology is essential to efficiency gains, but energy supply for data architecture must be aligned with sustainability objectives.”

The growth of sustainability-linked finance is also changing the investment landscape. Financial institutions are increasingly applying emissions and governance criteria to lending and investment conditions. Some financing agreements require ongoing sustainability performance reporting, linking interest rates or credit access to verified outcomes. Industry advisers note that sustainability-linked finance is accelerating board-level engagement and influencing procurement decisions for IT systems, vehicles, equipment, and facilities.

Collaborative frameworks are emerging to support alignment and benchmarking. Tiaca’s BlueSky sustainability assessment programme provides companies with structured evaluation and comparison tools across multiple dimensions, including environmental, social, and governance factors. Such frameworks are being used to identify gaps, prioritise investment, and compare performance across regions and business models. “Assessment tools like BlueSky are helping companies benchmark sustainability performance and prioritise investment,” Hughes said.

The direction of policy and regulatory development indicates that sustainability reporting and fuel transition requirements will tighten further. As compliance expands, airfreight stakeholders are focusing on building resilient data systems, integrating SAF-based commercial models, and coordinating emissions strategies across supply chain partners. The sector’s decarbonisation path will require sustained investment, cross-industry collaboration, and continued development of verifiable reporting practices. “The next generation of sustainability leaders will need both technological insight and operational expertise to drive meaningful change,” McDermott said.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AdobeStock_410592669-1080x720.jpeg,N,,2025-10-31 17:01:12.777398

All of the end products that will be produced at the facility are “drop-in” fuels that can go into today’s aviation, trucking, and maritime engines and industries to help decarbonize transportation and heavy industrial use.

Under the partnership, Plug will provide engineering design, key product supply, fabrication, and project oversight. Construction of the facility and equipment is expected to commence in the coming months.

“Edgewood is focused on developing scalable renewable fuel platforms that turn waste streams into valuable, low-carbon energy,” said Steve Harrington, CEO, Edgewood Renewables. “Partnering with Plug brings deep process expertise and proven execution capabilities that ensure these facilities will set a new benchmark for performance and reliability. Plug’s knowledge and know-how in the hydrogen space is a natural extension into the renewable fuels market.”

This partnership marks Plug’s first major engagement supporting renewable fuel production using biomass feedstocks and RNG, expanding the company’s reach beyond hydrogen into complementary clean-fuel markets. Plug’s role draws on its extensive experience designing and constructing large-scale hydrogen production plants in Louisiana and Georgia, as well as the company’s long track record of engineering complex energy infrastructure rooted in decades of oil and gas project expertise.

“The renewable fuels work we’ve been doing with Edgewood at their Las Vegas area facility builds directly on Plug’s foundation of large-scale project execution,” said Jose Luis Crespo, President and CRO, Plug Power. “Our engineering, plant design, and commissioning teams have delivered major hydrogen facilities from concept to operation, capabilities that translate seamlessly to advanced biofuel projects.”

“This partnership underscores the versatility of Plug’s engineering and project execution teams,” added Alan Sharkey, EVP of Project Execution, Plug Power. “Whether hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel, or biomethanol, we know how to integrate complex systems at scale, and that’s exactly what’s needed to move renewable fuels forward.”

Together, Plug and Edgewood are pioneering the integration of renewable feedstocks and advanced process design to deliver sustainable, domestic fuel solutions that advance the energy transition.",https://www.chemengonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ce-sm-logo-400x400-sb.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 19:01:08.232147

“Tourism, going forward, is going to be a key part of growth … becoming an even more important part of the economy in the Philippines,” he said on Friday (Oct 31).

As an archipelago of around 7,000 islands, the Philippines relies heavily on air travel to connect its many regions and communities. The domestic market accounts for about 70 per cent of Cebu Pacific’s total capacity.

“There aren’t many alternatives when it comes to public transportation. From an economic standpoint, the domestic market will remain extremely resilient,” Szucs said.

“The international market, that will be more subject because there's more discretionary spending both for incoming (tourists) and those outbound. But even so, the population growth is so big. It's such a large, addressable market.”

FLEET EXPANSION

On Friday, the budget airline announced a two-month partnership with Bulgarian national carrier Bulgaria Air to boost capacity during the holiday season.

In December and January, two Airbus A320ceo aircraft will fly four domestic routes from Manila to Cebu, Davao, Iloilo and Cagayan de Oro.

Under the arrangement, Bulgaria Air will provide the aircraft, pilots, maintenance and insurance, while Cebu Pacific will supply cabin crew.

To meet long-term growing demand, Cebu Pacific last year ordered 152 Airbus jets worth US$24 billion. The order begins in 2029 and will be delivered through 2035, Szucs told CNA.

Amid a global aircraft shortage caused by supply chain disruptions, some airlines have turned to China’s Commercial Aircraft Corporation (COMAC) as an alternative to Airbus and Boeing. Szucs said the competition is healthy for the industry.

“It's great that there is potential for another manufacturer of jets coming onto the scene. Competition improves products and also improves economics,” he said.

He added that Cebu Pacific would consider COMAC planes once they receive international certifications.

“COMAC will have to go through the certification requirements, principally with the FAA and ISSA,” he said, referring to the United States’ Federal Aviation Administration and the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) Standard Safety Assessment.

“That's clearly on their milestones, and it's clearly going to happen at some point. As soon as COMAC is available, it's something that we will consider.”

SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL

As airlines worldwide race toward net-zero emissions, Szucs said he believes sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) offers the most practical way forward.

SAF is a liquid fuel made from feedstock including waste oil and fats. It can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to traditional jet fuel.

Unlike hydrogen or electric alternatives, sustainable aviation fuel can be used immediately with existing aircraft and airport infrastructure.

Other proposed technologies would require modified or new aircraft engines, infrastructure and regulatory systems that do not yet exist at scale.

Despite its promise, the main challenge with sustainable aviation fuel is its limited availability and high cost. It accounted for just 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production in 2024, and is between two and five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel.

“All aircraft today and for the foreseeable future will need hydrocarbon fuel, and SAF is the way. Airlines need to explore ways of how we can get more SAF produced on an economic scale,” he said.

Szucs noted that unlike fossil fuels, which are concentrated in certain parts of the world, sustainable aviation fuel has one clear advantage: it can be produced locally – potentially stimulating domestic economies in the process.

FLEET MODERNISATION

The Cebu Pacific CEO said the most impactful step airlines can take today is upgrading to more fuel-efficient aircraft and engines.

Currently, about 72 per cent of the carrier’s all-Airbus fleet is fitted with advanced engine options that reduce fuel burn by around 18 per cent, Szucs said.

Beyond aircraft upgrades, another practical way to reduce the industry’s carbon footprint is electrifying ground operations and vehicles such as airport buses, pushback tractors and baggage carts, he added.

“Everyone’s got an obligation to make sure they're taking the steps on what I consider to be the low-hanging fruits. That's deliverable today. Airlines should be progressively replacing (such) equipment,” he said.","https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--nLChqtM1--/c_crop,h_444,w_790,x_0,y_0/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2025/10/31/screenshot_324.png?itok=e6VqVhfz",N,,2025-10-31 12:01:40.371251

The process begins with hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of waste feedstock, such as by-products from a nearby food-processing facility, turning organic waste into a biocrude oil. This biocrude then undergoes catalytic hydrotreating using a cobalt-molybdenum catalyst to strip out unwanted elements such as nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen. The result: a hydrocarbon blend that passes Tier Alpha and Beta pre-screening by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and meets specifications for conventional jet fuel.

The researchers emphasize that food waste is just one viable feedstock; the HTL platform can process a wide range of biowaste, including sewage sludge, algal blooms, swine manure, and agricultural residue. That flexibility helps avoid the food-versus-fuel debate, supporting a true circular bio-economy model. According to lead author Sabrina Summers, the engineering work “solves the science and engineering problems” so that industry can scale the approach.

From a design and engineering perspective, this work is significant for several reasons: it provides a drop-in solution that operates within existing jet-fuel infrastructure; it addresses the twin challenges of carbon emissions and waste management; and it creates business-model opportunities at the intersection of food processing, waste conversion, and aviation fuel supply. The path to commercial scale remains: cost control, feedstock logistics, catalyst lifetime, and refinery integration must still be addressed. For engineers involved in process design, systems integration, and sustainability road mapping, this research underlines that waste streams can become high-value inputs in high-energy domains such as aviation.

Therefore, if future air travel is to be sustainable then one key question that we must answer concerns our ability to produce aviation fuel in a sustainable manner. In this regard, we need to address the critical challenge of scaling up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in the United States to satisfy the government’s goal of meeting 100 percent of aviation fuel demand with SAF by 2050.

Since current SAF production is only a fraction of total jet fuel use, scaling up requires a shift from food-based feedstocks to high-yield, low-carbon, cellulosic biomass sources such as miscanthus, switchgrass, and corn stover. However, the problem is that miscanthus—despite its high yield and carbon sequestration potential, entails large upfront establishment costs, longer maturity periods, and greater yield uncertainty, which discourage adoption by farmers with limited credit or higher risk aversion. On the other hand, switchgrass and corn stover, while lower yielding, pose fewer financial and intertemporal risks.

New research sheds interesting light on the potential of cellulosic feedstocks — specifically perennial bioenergy crops like miscanthus and switchgrass, and the crop residue corn stover — to provide a low-carbon alternative to petroleum-based jet fuel. The point to note is that the adoption of these feedstocks, particularly high-yielding miscanthus, is hindered by significant barriers for farmers, including high upfront establishment costs, delayed returns, and risks that differ from conventional annual crops like corn and soybeans.

The research demonstrates how different farmer characteristics, i.e., risk aversion, time preferences (discount rates), and access to credit, influence the supply and mix of these feedstocks. Furthermore, it evaluates the cost-effectiveness of two alternative carbon payment designs in overcoming these barriers and incentivizing the production of feedstocks that maximize carbon mitigation.

Integrated, economic-biogeochemical modeling yields three noteworthy provoking insights. First, the characteristics of U.S. farmers affect their feedstock choice and SAF supply. Under a “Low-Constraint” scenario (meaning low risk aversion, low discount rate, and access to credit), farmers predominantly choose the high-yielding, low-carbon miscanthus at moderate biomass prices, leading to substantial SAF production. In contrast, “High-Constraint” farmers (meaning highly risk-averse, present-biased, and credit-constrained) overwhelmingly prefer the lower-yielding but less risky switchgrass, resulting in up to 48 percent lower SAF production at the same biomass price. Importantly, credit constraints are the single most significant barrier to miscanthus adoption.

Second, the design of carbon payments is pivotal. The research under discussion compares an “Annual Payment” (which is a yearly payment per ton of carbon dioxide mitigated) with an “Upfront Payment” (which is a lump sum paid in the first year for the total carbon mitigated over a 15-year crop lifespan).

For credit-constrained farmers, upfront payments are far more effective. Put differently, upfront payments are more cost-effective per dollar spent on carbon mitigation for this group. In contrast, for farmers with access to credit, annual payments are generally more cost-effective. These farmers, less burdened by initial costs, respond better to a steady income stream and choose the most efficient feedstock for carbon mitigation in their region without needing a large upfront sum.

Third, the spatial pattern of feedstock production shifts with policy and farmer characteristics. Without carbon payments, “High-Constraint” farmers avoid miscanthus even in the high-yielding Midwest. Upfront payments uniquely change this pattern, enabling miscanthus production in the Midwest while switchgrass remains dominant in the Southern U.S. This demonstrates that effective policy can alter the geographic distribution of bioenergy crops.

Policies that ignore farmer heterogeneity are likely to overestimate the potential for bioenergy crop production. One-size-fits-all policies, such as tax credits like annual payments, may fail to engage credit-constrained or risk-averse farmers. Instead, a targeted approach is necessary. Policymakers should consider hybrid incentives that include upfront cost-share components or risk-mitigating instruments like insurance, tailored to the carbon performance of different feedstocks and the financial realities of different farmers.

In sum, we learn that the successful decarbonization of aviation through SAF depends not only on feedstock agronomy and conversion technology but critically on the nuanced design of economic incentives that account for the diverse risk, time, and financial constraints of the farmers who will ultimately produce the necessary biomass.

The binding term sheet grants New Rise AU an exclusive 15-year license to use the design, layout, and configuration of XCF's New Rise Reno facility to build and operate at least three SAF facilities across Australia. XCF will receive a 12.5% equity stake, licensing fees, and one board seat in New Rise AU.

Australia is emerging as one of the world's most promising markets for renewable fuel. A Deloitte report commissioned by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation highlights a AUD$36 billion opportunity to develop a world-leading low-carbon liquid fuels (LCLF) industry capable of cutting emissions by 230 million tons by 2050 and strengthening the country's energy independence.

Australia imports ~80% of its liquid fuels, spending more than AUD$50 billion in 2023 alone, while exporting AUD$3.9 billion in potential LCLF feedstocks. With less than 50 days of fuel reserves currently held onshore, well below the International Energy Agency's recommended 90 days, the country's reliance on imports leaves it vulnerable to global disruptions.

Recognizing this imbalance, the Australian federal government has prioritized low-carbon liquid fuels under its Future Made in Australia initiative, providing access to the AUD$1.7 billion Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund to support the development of a LCLF industry, which includes SAF and renewable diesel.

With major airlines like Qantas and Virgin Australia targeting net-zero emissions by 2050, demand for locally produced SAF is expected to surge, creating strong momentum for investment and development across the region.

This milestone builds on XCF's international expansion strategy, built on capital-efficient, regionally tailored partnerships that accelerate global SAF adoption. It follows the June 2025 Memorandum of Understanding entered into with Continual Renewable Ventures Pty. Ltd., which laid the foundation for today's binding agreement.

Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global, commented, ""Our partnership with New Rise AU accelerates XCF's global expansion strategy and underscores the scalability of our modular renewable fuel platform.

In Europe and the United States—the main production hubs—SAF is three to four times more expensive than conventional jet fuel.
“Petrobras is ready to supply renewable jet fuel (SAF) using Brazilian-developed technology as early as 2025, ahead of international requirements,” the company said, without giving a firm start date.
Latam Airlines is also monitoring domestic SAF production.
“That’s why the company supports public policies to encourage SAF production and use, ensuring a fair and affordable transition for the industry and passengers,” the statement said.","Worldwide, the aviation sector has pledged to reach net-zero CO₂ emissions by 2050. In Brazil, regulatory changes take effect in 2027, requiring airlines to cut emissions by at least 1% through the use of sustainable fuels.

According to consulting firm Bain & Company, the transportation sector accounts for 16% of global greenhouse-gas emissions—and 40% of those are considered hard to decarbonize through electrification. Aviation alone is responsible for about 2.5% of total global emissions.

In this context, sustainable fuels are viewed as the most viable short- and medium-term solution for reducing transport-sector emissions. Yet Bain estimates SAF’s share of global aviation fuel will rise only from about 1% today to 21% by 2050—based on national targets for its use, said Felipe Cammarata, a partner in Bain’s energy and natural resources practice in South America.

Brazil adopted its own targets under the Fuels of the Future Law, enacted in 2024. Under the law, airlines operating domestic flights must cut their emissions by 1% through the use of SAF starting in 2027, with the requirement gradually increasing to 10% by 2037.

Eduardo Calderon, director of operations, control, and sustainability at Gol, said the industry is concerned about the 2027 mandate, especially since Brazil still lacks domestic production of the biofuel. “Our concern is the 2027 target. Importing doesn’t make sense—and 2027 is right around the corner,” he said, noting that the higher cost of SAF is also a challenge. In Europe and the United States—the main production hubs—SAF is three to four times more expensive than conventional jet fuel.

While waiting for domestic supply to emerge, airlines are focusing on other measures to curb emissions, chiefly fleet renewal. Gol’s new Boeing 737 MAX aircraft emit 15% less CO₂ than the previous generation—a gain also achieved by other manufacturers.

In parallel, Gol is testing a pilot carbon-offset project based on the “Book & Claim” model, which allows it to buy carbon credits generated by other airlines abroad that have flown using sustainable fuel. The federal government is now debating whether to recognize this mechanism for official emissions accounting. “It’s a two-way street,” Mr. Calderon said. “Right now we offset through SAF used abroad. But once we start producing in Brazil, we won’t have to export the fuel to claim its sustainability attributes. It’s an important step while SAF isn’t physically available here.”

Several projects are under development in Brazil, with production expected to begin only after 2028. These include initiatives by Petrobras, Refinaria Riograndense, and Acelen. Petrobras is also developing renewable jet fuel using the same co-processing technology already applied to its renewable diesel. “Petrobras is ready to supply renewable jet fuel (SAF) using Brazilian-developed technology as early as 2025, ahead of international requirements,” the company said, without giving a firm start date. The earlier target had been mid-2024.

Latam Airlines is also monitoring domestic SAF production. The group has pledged to source 5% of its fuel from SAF by 2030. “Latam is committed to leading aviation’s transformation in South America and meeting the global goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 through energy efficiency, new technologies, SAF, and carbon offset via ecosystem conservation,” the company said in a statement. It described SAF as an “essential pillar” of decarbonization. Still, it acknowledged that its current cost remains a barrier. “That’s why the company supports public policies to encourage SAF production and use, ensuring a fair and affordable transition for the industry and passengers,” the statement said.

Azul also classifies SAF as a strategic issue in its operations and remains committed to the 2050 reduction goals. “To meet those goals, the use of SAF is essential,” said Filipe Alvarez, Azul’s sustainability and governance manager. “That’s why, even before the Fuels of the Future Law was approved, Azul was already working consistently to develop Brazil’s SAF supply chain, particularly through collaboration with the Brazilian Union of Biodiesel and Bio-kerosene (Ubrabio) and the National Sustainable Aviation Fuel Program (ProBioQAV) under the Ministry of Mines and Energy.”

Airports are also taking action. According to a joint survey by the Ministry of Ports and Airports (MPor) and the Association of Private Port Terminals (ATP), the Brazilian airport sector invested R$138.4 million in environmental initiatives in 2023 and 2024. Key decarbonization measures include replacing fossil-fuel systems with lower-impact alternatives such as electric ground-support equipment for aircraft.",https://s2-valorinternational.glbimg.com/kltoCoOIdRoBgOKbqPwHV69Gdkc=/1200x/smart/filters:cover():strip_icc()/i.s3.glbimg.com/v1/AUTH_63b422c2caee4269b8b34177e8876b93/internal_photos/bs/2025/3/R/0as3S9SCil6albfAPQQQ/foto30emp-101-saf-b4.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 09:56:12.726076

What the target means Under regulations like ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, SAF will gradually replace conventional jet fuel on flights departing from EU airports.
In 2024 EU-wide SAF supply reached about 0.6 % of aviation fuel.
For you, the traveller, that means you can continue to explore Europe with more confidence in the long-term sustainability of air travel.

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) reports that Europe is on track to meet its target for adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2030. The move is good news for flying greener—but it brings travel implications as well.

What the target means

Under regulations like ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, SAF will gradually replace conventional jet fuel on flights departing from EU airports. The target calls for increasing SAF shares, making flights more sustainable. EASA says the industry is moving forward.

In 2024 EU-wide SAF supply reached about 0.6 % of aviation fuel. While small, it already cut roughly 714 000 tonnes of CO₂—roughly equal to 10 000 flights between Madrid and Paris.

What this means for you as a traveller

If you’re planning a holiday or a business trip across Europe, here’s what to consider:

You might choose flights on airlines emphasising SAF use. These carriers could market themselves as greener.

While direct flight paths remain largely unchanged, cost pressures may rise as airlines invest in SAF infrastructure. Some smaller carriers could adjust their route networks.

Airports in remote or less-served regions might face slower uptake if SAF distribution is uneven. That could affect connectivity for travel off the beaten path.

The hurdles ahead

Despite strong progress, hurdles remain. SAF currently costs roughly €2 085/tonne compared to about €734/tonne for conventional jet fuel. That price gap means scaling SAF remains challenging for many airlines.

Moreover, most SAF feedstock still comes from outside the EU: around 69 % as of recent data. Finland is Europe’s largest SAF producer, contributing about 10 % of the supply.

Travel-friendly destinations and shifting routes

For world travellers keen on exploring hidden European gems, the SAF shift presents both opportunity and caution. On the plus side: greener flights mean you can feel better about your carbon footprint when visiting scenic isles, countryside airports or cultural towns.

On the caution side: smaller airports may lag in SAF access. If airlines serving them struggle with cost or logistics, your connections could change. For example, you might land at a larger hub and transfer via ground transport rather than fly direct into lightly served airports.

Smart travel planning tips

Check if your airline has announced SAF-related sustainability efforts.

When flying to remote destinations, allow buffer time in your schedule in case carrier networks adjust.

Consider alternative transport options from major hubs—train or ferry may replace a direct regional flight.

Look for flights labelled with “lower emissions” or “eco-friendly fuel” offerings (some carriers offer them).

Why this shift matters for global travellers

The aviation sector accounts for a significant chunk of emissions. SAF is seen as one of the most effective means to bring those emissions down in the next decade. The EU estimates that SAF uptake will help reach the climate goals set for 2030 and beyond.

For you, the traveller, that means you can continue to explore Europe with more confidence in the long-term sustainability of air travel. From Lisbon to Lapland, from Mediterranean islands to Alpine valleys—you’re part of a broader move toward cleaner skies.

Looking ahead

EASA emphasises that a functioning reporting system is in place and that initial SAF deliveries are happening across Member States. The agency says the first annual technical report marks an important milestone for future efforts.

If all goes well, by 2030 airlines operating across Europe will blend significantly more SAF into their fuel mix. For your future flights this could mean slightly different aircraft, slightly different fuel sourcing, but many of the same beautiful destinations. What changes is the travel footprint you leave behind.

Final thoughts

Flying across Europe remains a seamless adventure for travellers from around the world. But as sustainability becomes integral to aviation, the experience subtly shifts. Routes may evolve, carriers may adjust, but the goal remains: to keep exploring Europe’s rich tapestry of places with less impact on the planet.

The formal signing ceremony, live on day three of the FII9 event, marked a pivotal milestone in RedCloud’s expansion into the Kingdom—aligning with Saudi Vision 2030 and the country’s strategic focus on digital transformation and supply chain modernization. The joint venture, RedCloud Arabia, will deploy RedAI’s algorithmic infrastructure to digitize and transform FMCG trade across the country.

The Company and Kayanat held joint meetings with key players within the Saudi FMCG Industry—who are believed to represent around 20% of the $61Bn market 3 —supporting a targeted launch date of December 2025.

“FII9 was a catalytic event for RedCloud, where we heard from industry leaders to heads of state who shared our concern for global trading challenges including spiraling consumer prices and the waste of critical resources,” said Justin Floyd, CEO and Founder of RedCloud. “Bloomberg built the intelligence foundation for financial markets. Google built it for the internet. Supply chains are next. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will be a pioneer and leader in solving this problem and we are delighted to work with Majid and his team on expanding RedCloud’s intelligence foundation for global trade, moving human guesswork and manual trading to algorithmic transformation.”

“For nearly 90 years, Saudi Arabia has powered the world through reliable and affordable energy supply chains. Today, that same advantage will fuel the world’s AI factories,” added Majid Alghaslan, Founder of Kayanat. “Our collaboration with RedCloud reflects Vision 2030’s ambition to transform the Kingdom into a global hub where technology, data, and intelligence redefine trade—building predictive, autonomous, and sustainable economies of the future.”

RedCloud Arabia intends to focus on localizing RedAI’s capabilities to serve Saudi distributors, retailers, and manufacturers, enabling smarter purchasing decisions and addressing inventory shortfalls. The Company believes that traditional AI and LLMs train on public internet data, while RedCloud trains its models on private b2b supply chain data that can’t be accessed by the AI incumbents. The Company’s platform has already demonstrated success in high-growth markets such as Nigeria, Brazil, and South Africa, and is now poised to bring similar impact to the Middle East.

The announcement follows significant operational momentum for RedCloud: the Company more than doubled customer numbers year-over-year in the first half of 2025, launched a new partnership strategy for payments and financial services to maximize working capital across supply chains, and expanded its technology ecosystem through the NVIDIA Connect program alongside existing partnerships with AWS and Snowflake.

FII9 convened around 600 global leaders 4 including heads of state, speakers and innovators under the theme “The Key to Prosperity: Unlocking New Frontiers of Growth.” RedCloud’s presence at the event underscored its commitment to building the intelligence foundation for the FMCG industry—from manufacturer to retailer—within Saudi Arabia, the Middle East, and beyond.

GEELONG, Australia, Oct. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Carbon Revolution plc (Nasdaq: CREV) (the “Company”), a Tier 1 OEM supplier and the leading global manufacturer of lightweight advanced technology automotive carbon fiber wheels, today announced that it has reached agreement with Orion Infrastructure Capital (“OIC”) to provide a further up to US$7 million of funding. The Company also reports the cancellation of two electric vehicle (“EV”) wheel programs, which is consistent with the weakening of demand across the broader EV market.

Further US$7 million of OIC funding

Of the up to US$7 million of OIC funding, US$5 million was released on October 31, 2025, in exchange for the issuance of additional senior secured notes. The notes will have substantially the same terms as the Company’s existing senior secured notes outstanding (the “Existing Notes”). In connection with this funding tranche, the Company will also issue to OIC penny warrants to purchase an aggregate number of shares equal to 5.0% of the Company’s shares outstanding.

The release of the second US$2 million tranche of funding is subject to the agreement of both parties, with funding to occur on a date no earlier than March 31, 2026. As part of this funding, both OIC and the holders of Existing Notes have agreed to partial payment in kind, in lieu of cash, for certain interest payments until July 2026 and a further deferral of the commencement of principal repayments to January 2027.

Program cancellations and important business update

As previously disclosed in the Company’s release of July 25, 2025, the Company has a number of new programs entering, or expected to enter, production in the near-term, however, as a result of a decline in the volume of wheels ordered or projected to be ordered by certain customers, the Company revised its revenue forecasts downward and slowed its initial short-term expansion plans.

The Company has continued to experience lower than expected demand for certain programs, especially those tied to the EV space. The weakening of the broader EV market has led to the early cancellation of two programs by a customer, which the Company had initially expected to contribute substantial wheel volumes. The Company is pursuing claims in relation to these cancelled programs.

In addition, as disclosed in the Company’s release of June 3, 2025, the Company is currently not in compliance with certain Nasdaq continued listing requirements. The Company has submitted a plan of compliance to Nasdaq where it has sought an extension in accordance with its plan and is waiting for Nasdaq’s determination. However, even if such plan is accepted, the Nasdaq staff only has the discretion to grant an exception for regaining compliance until November 26, 2025.

Notwithstanding the additional US$5 million of OIC funding announced today (and the expected release of a further US$2 million of OIC funding), the Company expects that it may need to obtain additional funding in the short term and is actively seeking other strategic alternatives to be completed within this fiscal year (ending June 30, 2026).

In order to obtain sufficient liquidity to fund its business and operations, the extent of which funding need is partially dependent upon the outcome of the customer claims being pursued by the Company mentioned above, as well as to contribute towards regaining compliance with Nasdaq continued listing requirements, the Company is exploring other potential strategic and financing options, a portion of which may need to be obtained significantly earlier than the end of the Company’s fiscal year. The Company makes no assurances that it will be able to secure any of the aforementioned on satisfactory terms, or at all.

This milestone highlights the growing market demand for 8-hour-plus storage and reinforces confidence in the companies’ joint ability to deliver commercially viable, large-scale solutions.

“Our partnership with Eos goes beyond a single project – it’s about building a platform for long-duration storage at scale,” said Humza Malik, Frontier Chief Executive Officer. “Together, we’re demonstrating how innovative, safe, and sustainable zinc technology can support renewable growth and deliver dependable, flexible power for the grid of the future.”

Eos’ Z3™ technology builds on the company’s proven zinc-based chemistry, offering enhanced energy density, extended duration, and a safe, non-flammable solution ideal for long-life, grid-scale applications. As the partnership grows, Eos and Frontier are positioned to accelerate deployment of long-duration energy storage across key international markets, supporting renewable integration, grid stability, and global energy security.

The announcement coincides with the Company also achieving its final cash receipt milestone previously agreed upon between Eos and an affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management LP (Cerberus) as part of Cerberus’s strategic investment in the Company. No additional preferred stock or warrants will be issued to Cerberus at this time.

About Eos Energy Enterprises

Geneva, Switzerland, Oct. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

SEALSQ Corp (NASDAQ: LAES) (""SEALSQ"" or ""Company""), a company that focuses on developing and selling Semiconductors, PKI, and Post-Quantum technology hardware and software products, today announced a new initiative leveraging the expertise of its subsidiary IC’Alps to develop integrated cybersecurity and functional safety solutions for the global automotive industry.

This initiative aims to position SEALSQ at the forefront of protecting next-generation autonomous and connected vehicles against emerging cybersecurity threats. Autonomous and software-defined vehicles are becoming highly interconnected digital platforms, relying on over-the-air (OTA) updates, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, and advanced sensor fusion capabilities. However, classical cryptographic systems, such as RSA and ECDSA, are vulnerable to future quantum computer attacks, which could compromise vehicle control systems, data integrity, navigation, and safety.

With autonomous vehicles becoming mission-critical systems, cybersecurity and functional safety must evolve together. SEALSQ plans to leverage its secure semiconductor technology in combination with the expertise of its subsidiary IC’Alps, a leader in custom ASIC design for safety-critical industries.

Because it is cheaper and always safer to prevent, rather than correct failure consequences, IC’Alps applies Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) as a core methodology to detect, mitigate, and prevent potential systematic failures as early as possible. As ASICs frequently power critical system functions in automotive, IC’Alps integrates DFMEA (Design FMEA) into its design strategy in full compliance with IATF 16949 and other safety-sensitive industry standards such as medical devices (ISO 13485) and aeronautics (AS 9100 / JISQ 9100 / EN 9100). This proactive approach aims to ensure reliability, quality, and long-term operational integrity.

Additionally, these processes can directly support customers targeting ISO 26262 certification and developing systems across ASIL-A to ASIL-D levels. FMEA is a cornerstone of the technical risk management process under IATF 16949, ensuring robustness in design and production by anticipating and preventing failures that could affect yield, reliability, and safety. IC’Alps has developed and continued to develop critical IP blocks and complete ASICs for demanding automotive applications for worldwide leading semiconductor players, and Tier 1 suppliers , up to ASIL certification.

With IC’Alps’ expertise in DFMEA, ASIC development rigor, and activities dealing with ISO 21434 (automotive cybersecurity), SEALSQ ensures its secure silicon meets the highest standards of both cybersecurity resilience and functional safety for the automotive industry.

Why Post-Quantum Security is Critical for Autonomous Vehicles

As vehicles evolve into fully connected, software-defined systems, cybersecurity is no longer optional, it is foundational to safety, reliability, and consumer trust. Post-quantum security represents the next frontier in protecting these intelligent platforms from emerging threats including:

Imminent quantum vulnerability: Classical encryption protecting vehicles today will be breakable by quantum computers.

Growing connectivity risks : Constant OTA and V2X interactions expand attack surfaces.

Future-proofing safety and trust: Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) implementation ensures long-term vehicle integrity and secure autonomy.

""The future of mobility must be secure by design, not only for today, but for the quantum era,"" said Carlos Moreira, Founder & CEO of SEALSQ. ""By combining SEALSQ’s post-quantum cybersecurity leadership with IC’Alps' world-class ASIC safety methodology, we aim to ensure autonomous vehicles remain protected, reliable, and trusted for decades ahead.""

About SEALSQ:

MIAMI, Oct. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wrap Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: WRAP) (""Wrap"" or the ""Company"") , a global leader in innovative non-lethal public safety technologies company, today announced that the Company’s BolaWrap® Instructor Course has been recertified through the International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training (IADLEST) National Certification Program (NCP).

Originally certified in 2023, this 2025 renewal indicates that Wrap’s core non-lethal training curriculum continues to meet the national standard for police and corrections education established by IADLEST and adopted by Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) organizations across the country. National Certification is currently accepted in 37 states, with several states working on legislation to make NCP certification mandatory, positioning Wrap’s training content for broader adoption and agency-level credit eligibility.

The IADLEST National Certification Program, launched in 2015, was created to establish a single, rigorous national standard for law enforcement training.

America’s Fastest Growing Beer—American Rebel Light—and the NHRA continue to deliver a winning combination at the racetrack and on national TV, leveraging national sponsorships to transforming race-day fan passion into lifelong customer brand loyalty

Nashville, TN, Oct. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Rebel Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: AREB)—the unapologetically patriotic lifestyle brand behind American Rebel Light Beer ( www.americanrebelbeer.com ), America’s Patriotic, God-Fearing, Constitution-Loving, National Anthem-Singing, Stand Your Ground Beer —heads to Las Vegas with a full-throttle presence at the 25th Annual Dodge NHRA Nevada Nationals powered by Direct Connection , the fifth of six Countdown rounds (Oct. 30–Nov. 2). American Rebel is the primary sponsor with TSR Nitro for Matt Hagan’s Dodge//SRT Hellcat Funny Car and John Hall’s Buell Pro Stock Motorcycle, backed by national coverage on FS1 and full-weekend streaming on NHRA.TV .

For American Rebel Light Beer, NHRA weekends are more than exposure—they’re a connection with Americans who build, tune, race and drink what they love. The energy in the pits, on the track and captured on the national TV broadcast turns into real-world momentum at the shelf, accelerating distribution and fueling repeat purchase with a light lager built for clean, crisp refreshment.

“ NHRA weekends are where our brand meets America face-to-face. Teaming with TSR Nitro, John Hall and the NHRA on the sport’s biggest stages turns race day excitement into repeat purchase behavior. That’s the power of the American Rebel Brand with motorsports fans—one unmistakable combination that converts fans into lifelong customers of America’s Patriotic Beer, American Rebel Light,” said Andy Ross, CEO, American Rebel .

NHRA fans are hands-on, flag-forward, and fiercely loyal—people who keep their word and back brands that back America. That’s the American Rebel customer. When race fans pick up American Rebel Light, they’re not just reaching for another light beer; they’re choosing a beer that reflects their values and tastes—a beer that shows up where they show up, from the starting line to the checkout line. Motorsports like the NHRA + American Rebel Light Beer is the right partnership, in the right place, at exactly the right time.

Matt Hagan, Driver of the American Rebel Beer Dodge//SRT Hellcat Funny Car

Hagan rolls into The Strip at Las Vegas Motor Speedway as one of the defining forces of the Countdown— second in Funny Car, 112 points out of the lead , and on a track where he’s at his best: four Las Vegas wins and 11 career final rounds at this venue. Las Vegas marks Hagan’s 371st Funny Car start and 17th Nevada Nationals appearance —proof of a driver who knows how to channel the desert air into speed. “ Vegas is always big in the Countdown. The altitude can make power tricky, but our Dodge//SRT Hellcat has always responded here, ” Hagan said.

TSR Nitro’s two-car firepower sharpens the spear. Tony Stewart arrives sixth in Top Fuel , giving the organization a one-two punch as the championship chase tightens. Between them, the duo owns six combined wins at The Strip (Hagan with four)—and the experience to make every qualifying session count.

NHRA + American Rebel - America’s Patriotic Brand bring maximum horsepower

From Top Fuel to Funny Car to Pro Stock Motorcycle, American Rebel + NHRA is a natural fit: intense, authentic, and built for fans who show up early and stay until the last pair fires. That alignment is paying off. American Rebel Light Beer —a premium domestic light lager brewed without corn, rice, or added sweeteners —comes in at ~100 calories, 3.2g carbs, 4.3% ABV with a crisp, clean finish and lighter feel. Distribution now spans 15 states — AR, CT, FL, IN, IA, KS, KY, MN, MS, MO, NV, NC, OH, TN, VA —with chain activation growing as fast as the fanbase.

Forward-Looking Statement

This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, but are not limited to, expectations regarding American Rebel Holdings, Inc.’s (“American Rebel” or the “Company”) future performance, distributor partnerships, market expansion, brand visibility, consumer demand, and shareholder value creation. Specifically, statements related to anticipated distribution growth, new market entries, potential distributor agreements, and strategic business development initiatives are forward-looking in nature.

Such statements are based on current assumptions, estimates, and projections about the Company’s business and industry, as well as management’s beliefs and expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. These risks include, but are not limited to: changes in consumer preferences and purchasing behavior; competitive pressures in the beverage industry; supply chain disruptions or production limitations; regulatory changes affecting distribution, labeling, or marketing; the Company’s ability to secure, maintain, or expand distributor and retail partnerships; the outcome and timing of contract negotiations; the success and availability of marketing and promotional activities; and the risks detailed in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2025.

Additionally, the Company appeared before a Nasdaq panel on September 30, 2025, to address its stockholder equity deficiency, which was not cured prior to the expiration of the 180-day extension in August 2025. Since June 30, 2025, the Company has initiated multiple transactions — including debt conversions, minority equity investments, and equity issuances — that were not reflected in its Q2 FY2025 Form 10-Q. Management believes these actions have collectively positioned the Company above the $2.5 million minimum stockholder equity threshold required by Nasdaq. However, the Company is currently awaiting the panel’s decision, which will be based upon both the Company’s presentation and the Nasdaq staff’s recommendations. There can be no assurance that the panel will concur with management’s position or render a favorable ruling.

Researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have found an innovative way to turn everyday food waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Their new process, published in Nature Communications, could help the aviation industry achieve its net-zero emissions target by 2050.

The technique uses a method known as hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), which applies high heat and pressure to convert food waste into a thick biocrude oil—similar to how crude oil naturally forms underground. This biocrude is then cleaned and refined using hydrogen and catalysts to make it suitable for jet engines.

Dr. Sabrina Summers, lead researcher from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, explained that HTL can process various waste sources, including food scraps, animal manure, sewage sludge, and crop residues. This flexibility makes it ideal for creating renewable fuels from agricultural and industrial by-products.

After purification, the biocrude undergoes catalytic hydrotreating, which removes impurities such as nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. The team discovered that a cobalt molybdenum catalyst was the most efficient for refining the fuel. The final product passed all ASTM and FAA jet fuel standards—proving it can power aircraft without blending with fossil fuels.

Professor Yuanhui Zhang, who led the project, emphasized that the technology offers vast potential for scaling up. “Our research provides solutions to engineering challenges and opens doors for industries to commercialize sustainable aviation fuel,” Zhang said. He added that this innovation not only supports environmental goals but also strengthens economic development by turning waste into valuable resources.

This research demonstrates how circular bioeconomy principles can reshape industries by reusing waste, reducing pollution, and creating sustainable products for the future.

The research shows that Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) supply is heavily concentrated at major hubs, leaving many smaller airports without access and exposing Europe’s most remote communities to rising costs, compliance burdens and reduced connectivity.

ERA’s airline CEOs stress that, while the sector is fully committed to achieving net-zero CO₂ emissions by 2050, ReFuelEU’s current rollout risks penalising smaller and regional airlines and isolating the communities they serve.

Montserrat Barriga, Director General of ERA said: “Europe’s green transition cannot come at the cost of territorial regional cohesion. If ReFuelEU continues on its current path, Europe risks seeing airlines go bankrupt and losing vital air connectivity.”

Under the Destination 2050 roadmap, SAF is expected to deliver the largest share of aviation’s emission reductions. ReFuelEU requires suppliers to blend increasing shares of SAF, starting at 2% in 2025 and rising to 70% by 2050.

However, ERA members report that early implementation is ‘fragmented and unfair’, pushing airlines to redesign their network and threatening the viability of some routes.

The order brings its total commitment for the A321neo to 280 aircraft.

Vietjet is already a large Airbus customer and A321neo operator. With its growing order book, the carrier will more than triple its fleet in the coming years. Meanwhile, Airbus continues to grow its backlog for the A320neo family, with over 7,100 A321neos ordered by nearly 100 customers as of September 30, 2025.

Vietjet Seals The Deal

The deal comes as Vietjet converted its Memorandum of Understanding with Airbus into a firm order for 100 A321neos. The MoU was signed at the Paris Air Show in June, marking a significant milestone for both companies. At the time of the agreement, Airbus reported that the carrier had options for an additional 50 aircraft. The finalization of the contract reflects Vietjet’s commitment to fleet modernization and network expansion.

The A321neo is the largest member of the A320neo family, offering longer range and more seating capacity. Airbus markets the aircraft as being 20% more fuel-efficient and 50% quieter than previous-generation single-aisle jets. As with the manufacturer’s other in-production aircraft, the A321neo is capable of operating with 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with a target to increase to 100% within the next five years. Speaking about the order, Vietjet Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao said:

“This is not merely a commercial contract, but a symbol of trust, aspiration, and a shared vision for sustainable development and global connectivity.”

Growing The Partnership With Airbus

The A321neo order follows Vietjet’s May 2025 order for 20 A330-900s. The contract doubled the airline’s firm orders for the A330neo to 40 aircraft. The new-generation widebody will allow the Vietnamese carrier to increase flights on high-capacity routes across Asia-Pacific and launch new long-haul routes to Europe. The A330-900 is the larger of the two A330neo variants.

Vietjet currently operates an Airbus-strong fleet, although it briefly leased a COMAC C909 for six months and took delivery of its first 737 MAX. Including aircraft operated by Vietjet Thailand and Vietjet Qazaqstan, the group has 121 aircraft, comprising A320-200s, A321-200s, A321neos, and A330-200s. The airline also has orders for over 400 aircraft, including the A321XLR and Boeing 737 MAX. Last month, Vietjet welcomed its latest Airbus A330, with registration VN-A820.

Vietjet flies to over 18 domestic destinations and 37 international destinations in the Asia-Pacific region. Its Airbus single-aisle jets are deployed to nearly 50 destinations, while the widebodies are deployed to seven destinations from Ho Chi Minh City. According to Cirium, an aviation analytics company, the top widebody route is from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi. The route sees up to 37 weekly flights. It is followed by Nha Trang to Hanoi with daily flights and Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh with five weekly flights. The top narrowbody route is also between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh with up to 117 weekly flights each way.

Growing The A320 Family Order Book

As of the end of September 2025, Airbus has received over 11,200 orders for the A320neo family, including 7,142 A321neos. The manufacturer has delivered 1,859 A321neos worldwide. Some of the largest customers include IndiGo and Wizz Air. Prior to the Vietjet deal, Airbus had received 289 A321neo orders in 2025, including 75 from Avolon, 55 from BOC Aviation, and 40 from United Airlines.

In total, the company has received orders for 610 aircraft and delivered 507 to 79 customers in 2025. Airbus is aiming to deliver 820 aircraft this year. The company would have to deliver an average of 104 aircraft each month for the remaining quarter to meet this target. By the end of September 2024, it had delivered 497 aircraft, while chasing a lower revised target of 770 aircraft.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_2544328827-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-31 08:56:14.147056

This report examines the transition from waste oils to next-generation fuels, assessing the scaling of renewable diesel, SAF, ethanol, and biodiesel alongside the emergence of synthetic fuels, ammonia, and methanol, and highlighting the feedstock shift toward residues and algae as the sector looks beyond 2030.

Global transport is under pressure to decarbonize, with heavy-duty vehicles, aviation, and shipping proving difficult to electrify. This report explores how alternative fuels are scaling, from today's reliance on renewable diesel, SAF, ethanol, and FAME biodiesel to tomorrow's frontier solutions, such as synthetic fuels, green and blue ammonia, and green and blue methanol.

Backed by mandates such as the EU ReFuelEU Aviation regulation and IMO's 2050 decarbonization targets, low-carbon fuels are attracting investment and corporate commitments from leaders like Maersk, Finnair, and United Airlines. Yet sustainability constraints on waste oils are driving a feedstock transition toward residues, MSW, and algae, with commercial availability still a decade away. This report offers critical insights into technology pathways, policy frameworks, and market opportunities shaping the future of low-carbon fuels.

Key Highlights

Transport emissions are projected to reach 8,019 MtCO? by 2030, with heavy truck emissions having risen at a 2.3% CAGR between 2000 and 2020, underscoring the urgency of diversifying decarbonization pathways.

Renewable diesel (RD) capacity is forecast to grow at a 16% CAGR between 2025 and 2030, with North America leading the way, followed by Europe and Asia.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is set to expand at a faster 36% CAGR over 2025-2030, supported by the EU's ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandating a 6% SAF blend by 2030 and voluntary airline commitments, such as United Airlines targeting 10% SAF by 2030.

Innovation in synthetic fuels, ammonia, and methanol is advancing, with shipping already leading methanol adoption, for example Maersk has over 25 methanol-fueled vessels on order, backed by offtake agreements with producers such as Orsted and Methanex.

The feedstock transition is underway: current reliance on waste lipids (animal fats, used cooking oil, vegetable oils) is constrained, driving investment in lignocellulosic residues, MSW-to-fuel, and algae, which offer scalability, circularity, and significant lifecycle emission reductions.

The ReFuelEU Aviation Annual Technical Report found that 0.6% of Europe’s supplied aviation fuel for 2024 was SAF. This percentage needs to increase rapidly, but nevertheless saved 714 kilotonnes of carbon emissions, the equivalent of around 10,000 flights between Madrid and Paris.

Overall, EASA believes the EU is on track to achieve its 6% blending target in the next five years. Whether the bloc hits its interim target of 2% SAF in 2025 will be assessed at the close of this calendar year.

China is Europe’s biggest supplier of biofuel

EASA’s findings also highlight the ongoing cost obstacles to SAF adoption. Currently, the average price of SAF sits at €2,085/tonne, compared to €734/tonne for conventional jet fuel. Until the cost becomes more competitive, it is difficult to see how SAF use can scale successfully. Earlier this year, Airlines for Europe (A4E) criticised the EU for imposing SAF mandates without taking action to create a viable SAF market. Nevertheless, EASA’s report affirms progress on the 6% target.

Europe’s biggest producer of SAF is currently Finland, responsible for 10% of supply. However, 69% of feedstock originates outside of the EU, with China the biggest supplier.

Maria Rueda, EASA’s safety management, sustainability and global outreach director, said:

This first annual technical report marks an important milestone and makes clear that the EU has taken important first steps.

A functioning reporting system is now in place, initial reporting compliance levels are solid, and SAF delivery is happening across multiple member states. This report sets an important benchmark for our sustainability efforts in the future.

The team converted food waste into biocrude oil through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), which can process feedstock from a wide range of biowaste, including food, sewage sludge, algal bloom, swine manure, and agricultural residue. Next, they remove impurities from the biocrude oil and then they refine it with the use of hydrogen and catalysts to turn it into aviation fuel. They said this approach can be applied to a variety of feedstocks and types of oil, potentially leading to a new direction for obtaining fuels.

The process is detailed in Nature Communications and could help the aviation industry meet its 2050 net-zero ambition.

“HTL basically mimics the natural formation of crude oil in the Earth. It uses high heat and pressure to convert wet biomass into a biocrude oil. The goal of this work is to upgrade that biocrude oil into transportation fuels that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure,” said lead author Sabrina Summers, who recently graduated with a doctoral degree from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE).

For this project, the researchers used waste from a food processing facility. Globally, over 30 per cent of food is wasted annually at all levels of the supply chain, from farm to transportation, processing, retail, food service, and households. Food decomposition in landfills and wastewater treatment plants further contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.

“To meet the aviation industry’s goals to decarbonate jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,” said ABE professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang.

To convert biocrude oil into jet fuel, the researchers first removed impurities such as moisture, ash, and salt. They then used catalytic hydrotreating to eliminate unwanted elements like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulphur, leaving behind the hydrocarbons needed for fuel.

After testing dozens of options, they identified cobalt molybdenum as the most effective commercially available catalyst to drive the necessary chemical reactions and refine the oil into sustainable aviation fuel.

To optimise the hydrotreatment process, the researchers adjusted variables such as temperature, catalyst and hydrogen loads, and retention time to identify the best conditions for producing jet fuel.

They then tested their sustainable aviation fuel against standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the US Federal Aviation Administration. Their SAF sample is said to have passed Tier Alpha and Beta pre-screening tests and met all specifications for conventional jet fuel without requiring additives or blending with fossil fuels.

The technology has the potential to be scaled up for commercial production, Zhang said.

“Our research helps solve the science and engineering problems, and then the industry can step in. The process can be applied to other types of oils for SAF. It can also replace other materials, such as petroleum-derived compounds for making plastics. This has huge potential for business opportunities and economic development,” he said",https://s44864.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sabrina20ummers.webp,N,,2025-10-31 05:56:25.902326

Since joining Air India Limited as Head of Sustainability and CSR in September 2024, he has been instrumental in driving the airline’s transition towards greener operations.

Under his leadership, Air India signed a game-changing MoU with Indian Oil Corporation in 2025 for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) supply, part of India’s ambition to achieve 5% SAF blending by 2030 and align with global net zero objectives.

“Sustainability is not a separate agenda; it’s core to future business viability,” Dr. Ranjan asserts. This piece traces his career journey, his impact at Air India, and the broader implications for India’s clean aviation future.

From Rural Development to Corporate Leadership

Before emerging as a CSR leader, Dr. Nilay Ranjan cut his teeth as a Rural Development and Convergence Expert with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), working on government flagship rural employment initiatives such as MGNREGS.

His foundational work in rural convergence and policy formulation laid the groundwork for his systemic understanding of sustainable development challenges in India. Dr. Ranjan himself notes, “My time in rural development ingrained the importance of inclusive growth and multi-stakeholder collaboration.”

With a PhD in International Relations from Jawaharlal Nehru University and executive education from the Indian School of Business, he transitioned into corporate CSR at Idea Cellular Ltd (later Vodafone Idea), where he oversaw CSR strategies for education, health, livelihood, and environmental initiatives.

His role evolved into managing ESG frameworks and a diversified grant portfolio covering over 24 NGOs before shifting to lead Education programs at Reliance Foundation. At every stage, his approach was anchored in aligning corporate goals with social impact, reflecting a balance of empathy and pragmatism.

Leading Air India’s Green Transformation

Dr. Ranjan took the helm of Air India’s Sustainability and CSR division at a time when the aviation sector faced increasing pressure for climate accountability.

His leadership crystallised in the August 2025 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Indian Oil Corporation, pioneering the supply of ISCC-certified Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) derived primarily from waste cooking oil and bio-waste at Indian Oil’s Panipat refinery.

This SAF partnership underpins India’s policy to blend 5% of sustainable fuel by 2030, positioning Air India at the forefront of India’s decarbonisation efforts and aligning with International Civil Aviation Organization’s CORSIA program to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

Complementing the fuel transition are operational efficiencies through digital tech adoption Air India has implemented SITA OptiFlight and eWAS systems, which optimise flight routing to cut fuel burn and reduce approximately 35,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.

Additionally, the airline is renewing its fleet with the acquisition of 570 new aircraft, all focused on enhancing fuel efficiency and lowering environmental impact.

Dr. Ranjan comments: “Sustainability in aviation demands an integrated approach fuel, technology, fleet, and people.” His push emphasises systematic transformation rather than isolated measures.

Multi-Stakeholder Approach for Holistic Impact

Dr. Nilay Ranjan’s unique strength lies in bridging sectors and perspectives. Air India’s CSR and sustainability thrust under his guidance includes not only fuel and tech innovation but also advocacy and community development.

Employee engagement programs foster sustainability awareness inside the organisation, while procurement policies prioritise eco-friendly vendors. Beyond the airline, Dr. Ranjan spearheads CSR projects in education, skill empowerment, and environmental stewardship inspired by his tenure at Reliance Foundation.

His philosophy is deeply systemic: “True sustainability thrives when we create shared value across environmental, social, and economic dimensions, rather than fragmented efforts.”

Air India’s inclusive sustainability narrative passionately involves government regulators, corporate partners, civil society, and local communities building a coalition for transformative, long-term impact.

The Logical Indian’s Perspective

Dr. Nilay Ranjan’s journey exemplifies the power of expertise, commitment, and ethical governance in corporate sustainability. Air India’s progressive steps under his leadership underscore how Indian companies can responsibly innovate while contributing to national and global environmental goals.

This story is a clarion call for more organisations to embed sustainability as a business imperative, not just a compliance mechanism.

The Logical Indian believes that such leadership inspires vital conversations around the intersection of economic growth and environmental preservation.

Utilisation rates compound the problem: existing plants operated at just 24% in 2024, leaving 3 million tonnes idle due to limited feedstock and weak demand.
For every tonne of fossil jet fuel replaced, another tonne will be added through expanded flying.","Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has become aviation’s favourite headline act in the race to net zero. Airlines trumpet offtake deals, airports celebrate the first SAF refuelling, and energy majors showcase refinery conversions. But behind the marketing gloss lies a sobering statistic: even under the most optimistic assumptions, SAF will replace only about 5% of global jet fuel use by 2030

Carbon Tracker’s Fuel Disclosure report shows that while global aviation emissions have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, actual production of alternative jet fuel remains negligible, just 1 million tonnes in 2024, or 0.3% of total jet fuel consumption.

Offtake commitments

Airlines have signed a wave of offtake agreements, but these commitments still cover less than 2% of potential 2030 consumption. Many of them are non-binding memoranda or letters of intent. Even if fulfilled, they will displace only a sliver of fossil jet fuel.

Carbon Tracker’s analysis of 54 million tonnes of such deals between 2020 and 2024 found that half the volume under non-binding agreements was delivered, but the rest remains uncertain.

The report describes a “chicken-and-egg” dynamic: offtakers are hesitant to sign long-term agreements, while producers are unwilling or unable to expand capacity without them.

Capacity projections fall short

Even factoring in every planned project globally, total SAF capacity is expected to reach 18 million tonnes by 2030, which is less than 5% of the anticipated jet fuel demand.

Utilisation rates compound the problem: existing plants operated at just 24% in 2024, leaving 3 million tonnes idle due to limited feedstock and weak demand.

In realistic terms, assuming 80% utilisation, all projects combined would supply about 13.5 million tonnes, meeting only 17–30% of additional fuel demand expected from traffic growth. For every tonne of fossil jet fuel replaced, another tonne will be added through expanded flying.

A price problem that won’t go away

Even as production ramps up, cost remains a formidable barrier. HEFA-based fuels, which dominate 82% of SAF output, sold for $1,800–2,780 per tonne in 2025, more than double fossil kerosene’s $715 average.

Feedstock costs account for up to 90% of production expenses, and the limited supply of used cooking oil or animal fats is pushing prices higher.

Without large-scale subsidies or carbon pricing, the premium of SAF will continue to deter adoption. Airlines with slim margins—fuel already represents about 25% of operating costs—cannot absorb these increases indefinitely.

What it means for the Middle East

Gulf carriers operate some of the world’s densest long-haul networks. These routes rely on high-energy fuels, where SAF substitution matters most but is the most challenging to achieve.

With global supply centred in Europe and North America, regional airlines face a procurement challenge. Unless local production emerges, the Middle East risks paying a premium for imported SAF or falling behind in sustainability metrics as EU and UK mandates tighten.

The region’s oil majors, including ADNOC, ENOC, and Aramco, are beginning to explore SAF refining and e-fuel ventures, but most are still at the pilot scale. The window to secure feedstock and technology partnerships is narrowing fast.

Carbon Tracker concludes that while truly sustainable alternative jet fuel will play a role in decarbonising aviation, “it may power a portion of long-haul flights but is unlikely to scale sufficiently to make a significant dent in aviation emissions.” For Middle East aviation leaders, the message is clear: investing early in synthetic fuels, hydrogen, and efficiency technologies will be crucial to hedge against a coming supply crunch.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/10/31/sean-wang-UzFwyYIB84Q-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 05:56:35.215463

Next, they remove impurities from the biocrude oil and then they refine it with the use of hydrogen and catalysts to turn it into aviation fuel. They said this approach can be applied to a variety of feedstocks and types of oil, potentially leading to a new direction for obtaining fuels.

The process is detailed in Nature Communications and could help the aviation industry meet its 2050 net-zero ambition.

“HTL basically mimics the natural formation of crude oil in the Earth. It uses high heat and pressure to convert wet biomass into a biocrude oil. The goal of this work is to upgrade that biocrude oil into transportation fuels that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure,” said lead author Sabrina Summers, who recently graduated with a doctoral degree from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE).

For this project, the researchers used waste from a food processing facility. Globally, over 30 per cent of food is wasted annually at all levels of the supply chain, from farm to transportation, processing, retail, food service, and households. Food decomposition in landfills and wastewater treatment plants further contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.

“To meet the aviation industry’s goals to decarbonate jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,” said ABE professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang.

To convert biocrude oil into jet fuel, the researchers first removed impurities such as moisture, ash, and salt. They then used catalytic hydrotreating to eliminate unwanted elements like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulphur, leaving behind the hydrocarbons needed for fuel.

After testing dozens of options, they identified cobalt molybdenum as the most effective commercially available catalyst to drive the necessary chemical reactions and refine the oil into sustainable aviation fuel.

To optimise the hydrotreatment process, the researchers adjusted variables such as temperature, catalyst and hydrogen loads, and retention time to identify the best conditions for producing jet fuel.

They then tested their sustainable aviation fuel against standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the US Federal Aviation Administration. Their SAF sample is said to have passed Tier Alpha and Beta pre-screening tests and met all specifications for conventional jet fuel without requiring additives or blending with fossil fuels.

The technology has the potential to be scaled up for commercial production, Zhang said.

“Our research helps solve the science and engineering problems, and then the industry can step in. The process can be applied to other types of oils for SAF. It can also replace other materials, such as petroleum-derived compounds for making plastics. This has huge potential for business opportunities and economic development,” he said.",https://www.theengineer.co.uk/media/3vxoowan/sabrina20ummers.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 05:56:52.943423

At the launch, Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said he looked forward to a “substantial outcome” by the next Apec Summit.

Topics to be considered under the Gepa include new environmental goods such as sustainable aviation fuel; non-physical environmental goods such as carbon credits; and trade-related climate measures.

These were recommended by officials from the three countries after several rounds of discussions, under a joint working group on trade and the green economy established in November 2024.

The aim is to set common rules and standards in these areas, said PM Wong. In doing so, the Gepa will modernise trade and investment policies to support the flows of such goods and services, lowering barriers to trade while accelerating the green transition.

It will also unlock opportunities in the green economy for companies and create good jobs, he added.

Collaborative spirit

“In the past, we have tended to see growth and sustainability as competing priorities,” said PM Wong in his speech at the launch. “But technological breakthroughs have challenged this assumption.”

Green energy sources are becoming viable alternatives to fossil fuels, and capital is flowing into low-carbon and energy-efficient solutions – showing that growth and sustainability can be mutually reinforcing, he said.

“Trade can facilitate our collective green transition, by facilitating cross-border flows of the goods, services, technologies and finance that enable it.”

New Zealand PM Christopher Luxon said that as the rapid pace of global regulatory change creates more complexity for businesses, countries must work together to help reduce the burden of compliance, with greater cooperation and coordination.

Pioneering partners

“Singapore is proud to partner Chile and New Zealand in this endeavour,” said PM Wong. “We may be three small countries, but we have a proven track record of pioneering innovative agreements together.”

He cited how the three countries and Brunei started the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership, which evolved into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.

The three countries also started the “first-of-its-kind plurilateral Digital Economy Partnership Agreement”, he added. “This continues to receive interest from other aspiring economies – a sign of the value which others see in it.”

Highlighting that the three countries are like-minded partners in sustainability efforts, Chile President Gabriel Boric flagged the value of the agreement as an example, saying: “I know other countries are looking to what we are doing.”

PM Wong encouraged the officials to be bold in developing the Gepa, and “look beyond conventional approaches, embrace new ideas, and draw on private-sector insights”.

“I am confident that by joining hands, we can turn trade into a force for good, catalysing economic growth while doing our part for the environment and global climate action.”

(“XCF”) (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”), today shared its perspective on the rapidly evolving global policy landscape shaping the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel.

The scale of the challenge – and opportunity – is immense. According to the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”), airlines will need approximately 165 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2050 to achieve net-zero emissions. In 2024, global SAF production totalled only ~330 million gallons – about 0.3% of total jet-fuel demand. Meeting 2050 decarbonization targets will require an estimated 27% compound annual growth rate in production capacity and the construction of 5,000 – 7,000 new facilities worldwide. This gap represents one of the most compelling growth opportunities in the global energy transition, with analysts projecting the SAF market could exceed ~$25 billion by 2030 and reach ~$270 billion by 2050.

Governments are responding. Across major markets, policymakers are using mandates and incentive schemes to accelerate SAF adoption. Today, more than 2 billion people globally live in countries with SAF blending mandates or strong incentives, such as tax credits – by 2030, this number is expected to grow to more than 4 billion people.

In the U.S., the SAF Grand Challenge aims to expand domestic consumption of SAF to 3 billion gallons per year by 2030 and 35 billion gallons per year by 2050.

In Europe,the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates that SAF make up 2% of all jet fuel by 2025, rising to 6% in 2030, 20% by 2035, and 70% by 2050, creating one of the largest mandated clean-fuel markets globally.

The UK has coupled mandates starting from 2% in 2025 and increasing to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040 with revenue-certainty mechanisms that help cover the price premium between SAF and conventional jet fuel.

Across Asia-Pacific, countries including Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea, and Singapore are developing frameworks that combine blending targets, tax incentives, and infrastructure funding to stimulate both production and demand.

“Global demand for SAF is shifting from ‘if’ to ‘how fast,’” said Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF. “Mandates, incentives, and procurement are converging to drive volume. These dynamics underscore the value of XCF’s early-mover advantage and modular design, which we’re now extending globally through partnerships such as with New Rise Australia, a venture that is expected to develop three SAF sites across the continent to meet Australia’s growing demand for sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.”

XCF highlighted three dynamics that will shape the next phase of growth:

Diverse toolkits, common direction. Regions may use different policy levers – mandates, subsidies, tax credits, or procurement – but they all point toward accelerating adoption.

Technology mix evolution. HEFA remains the dominant pathway in the near-term, while policy frameworks are creating headroom for emerging pathways to scale toward 2050 targets.

System reliability. Airlines and fuel suppliers need dependable volumes, transparent carbon accounting, and logistics that work across borders. Producers with operational capacity and credible expansion plans will lead.

“As SAF adoption transitions from pilot programs to long-term supply, reliability and verifiability become the new currency of trust,” Dange added. “XCF is building the backbone of that transition by advancing the infrastructure and partnerships needed to make SAF the new standard across global aviation.”

Here are my priorities for the 2026 Port of Seattle budget this year.

Strengthening pathways to workforce development programs for English Speakers of Other Language (ESOL)

I am proud of our state’s diversity and here in King County, data tells us that nearly 25% of our population are foreign-born. My staff and I learned that with this rich diversity, access to English language classes have long wait lists in order to gain the language proficiency to enter workforce development pathways for aviation and maritime industries. This is why I am supporting resources for English Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) pathways as one way to address workforce shortages reported by industry partners.

Continued support for Maritime High School operations

Maritime High School graduated its inaugural class in June. That is an exciting benchmark and testament to this innovative approach to high school education. I believe supporting Maritime provides options for young people who leave the classroom with industry credentials and ready to enter the maritime workforce upon graduation or go on to continue their education at post-secondary institutions. Whatever choice these young people make, it is an investment in them and a win for the maritime workforce.

A summit on sustainable maritime fuels convened by the Port of Seattle

The Port of Seattle is deeply committed to sustainability and climate action, detailed in our Century Agenda goal of becoming the greenest port in North America. Working with many different partners across public and private sectors, we have helped grow the conversation and ecosystem for sustainable aviation fuel. Now we are looking to do the same for sustainable maritime fuels by bringing together thought leaders across the many sectors with a summit to build pathways and relationships toward collective action.

Growing shipbuilding readiness as an economic development strategy for Washington state

Washington state has a strong shipbuilding legacy, but the industry has been shrinking for decades. The opportunity is ripe to reinvigorate the industry while also introducing advanced technologies to build low-emission and zero-emission vessels that can power trade and transport for decades to come.

Community-focused activations

With the refurbished and reactivated Seattle waterfront, we have an opportunity to say thank you to community members for their support in building a truly world-class public space, stretching from Pioneer Square to Interbay. I have requested resources to support increased activation to deepen the connection to our maritime heritage, our waterfront, and our being a port city with local residents and communities next summer, as we host the World Cup and also celebrate the 250th anniversary of our nation’s founding.

Reducing those emissions and otherwise making jet travel more sustainable is critical.

Aviation companies, both large and small, are responding with green initiatives. Understanding what they are can help you find the right partner for your next flight.

The Environmental Impact of Aviation

All forms of travel can have an impact on the environment, but flight is a major offender. Private flights, in particular, are harmful.

Researchers say private jets are 5 to 14 times more polluting than commercial planes. In one study of data from 2023, researchers found that private flights contributed at least 15.6 Mt CO2 in direct emissions.

This problem isn’t fading, as more people are using private flights. In the UK alone in 2022, private jets took off an average of once every six minutes.

Industry Commitments to Sustainability

Air transport professionals understand that their work can lead to environmental damage. They’re responding in significant ways.

For example, in 2021, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) passed a resolution committing its member airlines to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Similarly, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) was developed as a global measure that’s designed to limit carbon emissions from international flights.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

One important contribution to green aviation involves the development of new forms of fuel. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is made from feedstocks instead of fossil fuels, and it can be used to power all sorts of aircraft.

According to data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 24.5 million gallons of SAF were consumed in 2023.

United Airlines is one such customer. Less than 1% of their overall fuel consumption is SAF, but the company hopes to use more in the future.

Carbon Offset Programs

Carbon offsetting involves investing in carbon reduction projects to compensate for the carbon emissions associated with the flight. The IATA says more than 50 airlines use programs like this.

Offsets don’t reduce emissions directly. However, they can help other programs to grow, which could reduce the impact of a flight.

Innovations in Aircraft Technology

Changes in technology can also help mitigate the environmental impact of flights. Current changes include the following:

Electric- and hydrogen-powered aircraft

Lightweight materials for plane construction

Advanced aerodynamic designs for aircraft

Improved engine fuel efficiency

Optimized flight operation

Airlines Leading the Green Initiative

Major airlines are examining the data and making changes to their operations and programs. These are a few of the companies embracing green technology:

United Airlines

United Airlines has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Importantly, they’re trying to accomplish this goal without using carbon offsets.

United Airlines is using efficient aircraft, trying sustainable fuels, and collaborating with partners to help them streamline their operations.

JetBlue Airways

JetBlue Airways is working hard to achieve carbon-neutral status for all domestic flights. They’re also looking at incorporating new sustainability initiatives.

Initiatives include reusing materials, trying new fuels, and investing in sustainable aircraft startups.

Emirates

Emirates has invested in new aircraft, and the company claims to have one of the youngest fleets in the industry. All of the aircraft meet emission standards.

Emirates also uses flight-planning systems to ensure their routes are optimized and don’t need too much fuel. The company also uses alternate fuels on some flights.

Harbour Air

Harbour Air is the first carbon-neutral airline. The company uses a combination of carbon offsets, new fuels, and on-the-ground optimizations to ensure they don’t use more fuel than needed. They also partner with companies like Ostrom Climate to continue to innovate.

Charter Operators Embracing Sustainability

Jet charter companies are integrating sustainable practices into their operations. Each company is doing something a little different, but the result can include optimized flights and a reduced level of emissions.

Wheels Up

Private company Wheels Up has launched a SAF program. Customers can choose this option for their flights when booking, ensuring they take direct action against climate change.

VistaJet

Private company VistaJet has taken many steps toward sustainability. Those steps include the following:

Maximizing their fleet use

Adding new aircraft with high environmental ratings

Using carbon offsets

Advocating for SAF

JetLevel Aviation

JetLevel Aviation has committed to fleet modernization, focusing on acquiring aircraft equipped with reduced emissions technology. The company also partners with operators who prioritize eco-friendly flying.

Challenges & the Road Ahead

While airline operators are doing their part to reduce the impact of flights on the environment, more work must be done. After all, these steps just reduce emissions without eliminating them.

Companies must continue to innovate and grow, looking for new ways to use fuels that are eco-friendly. Consumers must also demand change from their operators to ensure they keep the environment in mind.

How You Can Contribute

As a consumer, it’s critical to choose partners with robust sustainability programs. If you find a company like this, be willing to pay a little more for your flights. This small increase in price could entice the company to further embrace the work.

You can also pay close attention to changes in green innovation. Instead of accepting simple carbon offsets, look for ways to support new aircraft and fuels.

(Chambana Today) — Scientists at the U of I have developed a breakthrough method to transform food waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that meets industry standards without blending fossil fuels. The new process, published in Nature Communications, could help the aviation industry achieve its goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The research team used a process called hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) to convert food waste into biocrude oil, which was then refined into jet fuel using hydrogen and catalysts.

“HTL basically mimics the natural formation of crude oil in the Earth. It uses high heat and pressure to convert wet biomass into a biocrude oil. The goal of this work is to upgrade that biocrude oil into transportation fuels that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure,” said lead author Sabrina Summers, a recent doctoral graduate in Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE).

The researchers sourced food waste from a nearby processing facility, but the process can also use sewage sludge, algal blooms, swine manure, and agricultural residue.

“To meet the aviation industry’s goals to decarbonate jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,” said ABE professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang.

After refining the biocrude oil and removing impurities, the team’s fuel passed all American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) prescreening tests for conventional jet fuel.

Zhang said the discovery could open the door to large-scale production and new economic opportunities. “Our research helps solve the science and engineering problems, and then the industry can step in. The process can be applied to other types of oils for SAF. It can also replace other materials, such as petroleum-derived compounds for making plastics. This has huge potential for business opportunities and economic development,” he said.

The project also supports a “circular bioeconomy,” Zhang added. “In a linear economy, we just produce something, use it, and throw it away. In this project, we take the waste and recover the energy and materials to make a usable product. This fills a missing link in the circular paradigm,” he said.

30 October 2025

Appoints seasoned industry leader as founding Chief Executive Officer

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has set up the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company Ltd. (SAFCo) to centrally procure sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for the Singapore air hub and support the implementation of Singapore’s national SAF policy. SAFCo is set up as a non-profit Company Limited by Guarantee wholly owned by CAAS. Mr Han Kok Juan, Director-General of CAAS, will chair SAFCo’s Board. Ms Tan Seow Hui, a seasoned leader in the energy and aviation industries, has been appointed as its founding Chief Executive Officer (see Annex A for Ms Tan’s curriculum vitae).

2 The setting up of SAFCo follows the passing of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (Amendment) Bill in Parliament on 14 October 2025, which allows for the implementation of SAF policies for air transport in Singapore and empowers CAAS to collect a SAF Levy, to set up a SAF Fund and to procure, manage and allocate SAF and SAF environmental attributes (EAs)1 or to establish and appoint a central procurement entity to carry out these functions. More details on the SAF Levy amounts will be shared later.

3 Through SAFCo, CAAS seeks to build a transparent and integrated SAF demand market that brings together airlines, corporate buyers of SAF, fuel producers, carbon market platforms2 and stakeholders across the aviation fuel chain in Singapore to aggregate demand, stimulate investment and accelerate the use of SAF:

a) SAFCo will centrally procure SAF using the SAF Fund to achieve the 1% SAF target in 2026, for flights departing Singapore. The amount of SAF procured by SAFCo will increase accordingly when the SAF target is raised to 3–5% by 2030, subject to global developments and the wider availability and adoption of SAF. SAF and SAF EAs will be sourced through a transparent competitive tender process from SAF suppliers that meet international sustainability standards like CORSIA. With predictable cashflows from the SAF Levy, SAFCo will be able to go into longer-term, competitive price agreements to secure a more stable and affordable SAF supply.

b) Beyond the regulated demand from the SAF Levy, SAFCo will also aggregate voluntary SAF demand from organisations seeking to purchase SAF to reduce their air travel or supply chain carbon footprint credibly and cost-effectively. The demand from the SAF Levy forms a scalable baseload, enabling SAFCo to negotiate attractive pricing for SAF and SAF EAs, and to anchor long-term supply agreements. Businesses that participate in SAFCo’s voluntary SAF purchases can leverage this baseload to unlock economies of scale. They can also gain access to competitively priced and verified SAF and SAF EAs through SAFCo and avoid the need to set up their own procurement systems.

4 As a new entity, SAFCo’s immediate priorities will be to establish robust governance and procurement frameworks, set up levy collection systems and processes and build manpower and procurement capability, while engaging stakeholders on the implementation, ahead of the first SAF procurement in 2026. SAFCo will also build a scalable voluntary demand programme for SAF and SAF EAs as a complement to the SAF Levy. SAFCo will reach out to businesses and airlines to encourage them to partner SAFCo and use its central procurement mechanism for voluntary SAF purchases. Conversations are ongoing; SAFCo will provide more details on the side of the Singapore Airshow in February next year. Interested businesses and airlines are encouraged to reach out to SAFCo at safcoadmin@safco.com.sg.

5 SAFCo will also support the development of the SAF supply ecosystem in Singapore and the region. With predictable and stable cashflows, SAFCo can sign longer and larger contracts with SAF suppliers, providing demand certainty in a still nascent SAF market. This approach aims to encourage investment in SAF production capacity and the development of SAF-related carbon markets in Singapore and the region.

6 Mr Han Kok Juan, Director-General, CAAS and Chairman of SAFCo said, “Singapore is taking a pragmatic, balanced and action-oriented approach to advancing sustainability in the aviation sector. The setting up of SAFCo is another concrete step forward. Through SAFCo, we want to get the best value for the SAF Levy collected and activate a SAF ecosystem which will help advance sustainable aviation and create new economic opportunities for Singapore and beyond.”

Now, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have discovered a novel way to address that problem—by converting food waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that meets industry standards without relying on fossil fuel blends.
The process in a nutshell is this: The researchers convert food waste into biocrude oil through a thermochemical conversion process called hydrothermal liquefaction, or HTL.

Now, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have discovered a novel way to address that problem—by converting food waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that meets industry standards without relying on fossil fuel blends.

Their process, described in a Nature Communications study, could help the aviation industry meet its ambitious goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The process in a nutshell is this: The researchers convert food waste into biocrude oil through a thermochemical conversion process called hydrothermal liquefaction, or HTL. Next, they remove impurities from the biocrude oil, and finally, they refine it with the use of hydrogen and catalysts to turn it into aviation fuel.

This approach can be applied to a variety of feedstocks and types of oil, potentially leading to a new direction for obtaining fuels.

""HTL basically mimics the natural formation of crude oil in Earth. It uses high heat and pressure to convert wet biomass into a biocrude oil. The goal of this work is to upgrade that biocrude oil into transportation fuels that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure,"" said lead author Sabrina Summers, who recently graduated with a doctoral degree from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE), part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences and The Grainger College of Engineering at U. of I.

In this project, the researchers used waste from a nearby food processing facility. Globally, over 30% of food is wasted annually at all levels of the supply chain—from farm to transportation, processing, retail, food service, and households. Food decomposition in landfills and wastewater treatment plants further contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and recycling waste helps promote sustainability.

But HTL can process feedstock from a wide range of biowaste, including food, sewage sludge, algal bloom, swine manure, and agricultural residue.

""To meet the aviation industry's goals to decarbonize jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,"" said ABE professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang.

To convert biocrude oil into jet fuel, the researchers first removed impurities such as moisture, ash, and salt. They then used a process called catalytic hydrotreating to eliminate unwanted elements like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur—leaving behind only the hydrocarbons needed for fuel.

After testing dozens of options, they identified cobalt molybdenum as the most effective commercially available catalyst to drive the necessary chemical reactions and refine the oil into sustainable aviation fuel.

To optimize the hydrotreatment process, the researchers adjusted variables such as temperature, catalyst and hydrogen loads, and retention time to identify the best conditions for producing jet fuel. They then tested their sustainable aviation fuel against rigorous standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration.

Their SAF sample passed Tier Alpha and Beta prescreening tests and met all specifications for conventional jet fuel—without requiring any additives or blending with fossil fuels.

The technology has the potential to be scaled up for commercial production, Zhang noted.

""Our research helps solve the science and engineering problems, and then the industry can step in. The process can be applied to other types of oils for SAF. It can also replace other materials, such as petroleum-derived compounds for making plastics. This has huge potential for business opportunities and economic development,"" he said.

Zhang has developed an index to measure circular bioeconomy, and he said SAF provides a valuable contribution to circularity.

""In a linear economy, we just produce something, use it, and throw it away. In this project, we take the waste and recover the energy and materials to make a usable product. This fills a missing link in the circular paradigm,"" he concludes.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2025/illinois-researchers-c.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 15:56:23.798052

Fuel Disclosure | Sustainable. Abundant. Feasible – why SAF is unlikely to be all three at once, is not anti-SAF and recognised the use of alternative jet fuels in the future decarbonisation of the industry. But it also downplays the runaway claims from some in aviation that SAF could be a short-term saviour for the industry.

2030 is cited as a near-term goal for increased uptake of SAF, but Carbon Tracker said the current plans for development and production will not allow for wide-scale decarbonsation.

“Even if all existing, under-development and announced projects ran at capacity, they would only be able to displace 5% of fossil jet fuel by 2030,” it explained.

While the growth in commitments and SAF deals is encouraging, there are key practical problems that will limit its growth.

Perhaps the most crucial of these leads from the most abundent production method for current SAF: crop and waste-based feedstock. While a September 2025 IATA report said 10,000Mt of feedstocks could used to make SAF, “only 12.3% of that would be available for use in aviation, after accounting for competing uses” according to Carbon Tracker.

“The overwhelming majority of alternative jet fuel today is derived from waste oils such as used cooking oil, which are a relatively more sustainable option than others. However, these feedstocks are in very short supply.”

Not only is the raw amount of available product to turn into SAF highly questionable, the infrastructure to actually do this is in its infancy. “Setting up an infrastructure to collect, transport, and pre-process feedstock is likely to take significant investment and time to scale up,” the report noted.

Because waste oil is a commodity fought over by many industries hoping to use it to lower their carbon emissions, “the industry will have to rely on other options, some of which are much more emission-intensive, and others can carry significant implications not yet assessed by the industry.”

Carbon Tracker’s analysts made the point that many of the so-called Sustainable Aviation Fuels actually emit almost as much CO2 as conventional kerosene.

Saidrasul Ashrafkhanov, Carbon Tracker analyst and report lead author, said: “On top of high costs, offtaker hesitation and financing constraints, most alternative jet fuels are also saddled with a handful of environmental downsides. These fuels may some day have a larger role in decarbonising aviation, but the burden of proof is on the industry to show that it can find a pathway that will deliver alternative jet fuel that’s at once sustainable, abundant, and feasible.”

Although the future of SAF and long-haul, carbon-intensive flight is questionable, the thinktank pointed to short-haul flights of 270 nautical miles (500 km) or less as an area with more potential for faster decarbonisation through alternative fuels.

“Battery-electric and hybrid-electric aircraft carrying 5-100 passengers are approaching entry into service, offering a direct path to zero-emission operations on regional legs. Hydrogen-electric aircraft could open up medium-haul markets from the mid-2030s. This creates a clearer near-term investment case and preserves scarce sustainable AJF for long-haul. Despite this potential, new-propulsion aircraft remain underfunded relative to AJF.”

While the SAF realities are difficult to overcome, and other fuels for short haul flights may be more useful in the short to mid-term, Carbon Tracker and the report authors suggested an urgent change is needed to the regulatory environment to push industry toward a coherent trajectory to decarbonisation.

Rich Collett-White, Carbon Tracker energy analyst and report co-author, said: “A bewildering array of policies designed to scale up alternative jet fuels is causing confusion, with definitions and eligibility criteria differing from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Consistent rules are needed to ensure fuels with high environmental integrity are prioritised, and unintended consequences avoided.”",https://www.airport-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2025/10/shutterstock_1340185619.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 14:03:13.730085

Think about it: commercial airliners have sputtered along on kerosene since Lindbergh’s day, but swapping out jet fuel for cryogenic hydrogen means overthrowing decades of engineering norms—tank shapes, insulation tricks, chillers that keep hydrogen at a frosty –253°C, and the fine-tuned flow control needed at cruising altitude. Falsetti’s no stranger to big challenges, bringing insights from EPFL, Nokia Bell Labs and Oxford’s Thermofluids Institute to the table. It’s a milestone that’s already causing a buzz in Europe’s aerospace circles—one that might rewrite the rulebook on zero-carbon flight.

Strategic Angle

Right now, aviation chalks up almost 3% of global CO2 emissions—and without a shake-up, that number’s headed north. Enter green hydrogen, which, when produced by renewable-powered electrolysis, burns clean (no CO2 in use). The snag? Keeping it chilled at –253°C under pressure is like trying to hold onto ice cubes in a blast furnace—boil-off rates creep above 2% per day, and safety protocols get hairy. Falsetti’s research aims to flip the script: advanced insulation, active cooling loops and smart control systems designed to slash boil-off to below 1%, cutting chuck-outs in half.

For airlines and lessors, the upside is huge: lighter, sleeker tanks, lower ground-handling costs and fuel budgets that don’t swing wildly. Knock 15% off tank weight and boost usable hydrogen by 20%, and you’re looking at tens of millions saved per aircraft over its service life—bridging the gap with classic jet fuel on the bottom line.

This project rides shotgun with big-ticket EU programmes—Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking and IPCEI Hy2Tech—which together funnel over €20 billion into industrial decarbonization and sustainable energy by 2030. Falsetti’s Vidi-funded work ties lab-grade science straight into real-world deployment, making it a cornerstone of Europe’s zero-emission technology push.

Technical Snapshot

The Vidi grant sets the stage for tackling three core challenges:

Boiling heat transfer: High-fidelity mapping of heat fluxes at cryogenic temperatures to model and minimize evaporative losses during take-off, cruise and landing cycles.

Phase-change dynamics: Adapting high-speed sensors and imaging from microelectronics evaporative cooling to peek inside two-phase hydrogen flow in pipes, valves and manifolds in real time.

Cryogenic storage architectures: Engineering next-gen composite insulation—think aerogel-infused multilayers paired with modular cooling loops—that integrates seamlessly with existing aircraft structures and refueling interfaces.

On top of that, the team leans into advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and digital twin platforms to simulate two-phase behavior virtually, tweaking designs before cutting any metal. TU Delft’s numbers suggest this digital-first approach chops nearly 30% off hardware development cycles and budget overruns. Their lab prototypes have already posted a 30% jump in thermal resistance thanks to novel sandwich composites. Coming up: a 200-liter demo tank built with Rolls-Royce and ESA, eyeing pilot-scale tests by mid-2026 to validate the tech under real-world conditions—and thanks to digital twinning, they can spin through dozens of design iterations overnight, slashing trial-and-error cycles.

Key Takeaways

Enhanced efficiency: Targeting a 20–30% cut in daily boil-off could deliver a 15–25% drop in total cost of ownership for hydrogen-powered fleets.

Infrastructure synergy: Partnerships with Amsterdam and Rotterdam airports to craft end-to-end storage-to-tank solutions, potentially trimming refueling station CAPEX by 20%.

Regulatory impact: Experimental data feeding into ICAO and EU safety standards will influence certifications, crew training protocols and airport operating procedures.

Cross-sector benefits: Innovations in composite insulation and two-phase diagnostics could spin off into LNG terminals, nuclear cooling systems and high-power electronics—supercharging industrial decarbonization.

Workforce development: Engaging over 20 PhD candidates and post-docs in training programs will build a skilled talent pipeline for the zero-emission technology arena.

Bonus point: the project’s sensor and materials breakthroughs could spawn new startups, further bolstering Europe’s role in sustainable energy and cryogenic tech sectors.

Parallel Moves

Meanwhile, across Europe, carriers like Lufthansa in Germany and Air France in France are kicking off hydrogen production and refueling pilots—though most efforts focus upstream on electrolysis and supply chains. That leaves a critical hole at the storage and delivery end. Falsetti’s work is poised to fill that gap, ensuring liquid hydrogen arrivals are chilled, contained and flight-ready for genuine zero-emission technology operations.

Plus, early-stage hydrogen corridor projects in Scandinavia and the Alpine region are laying the groundwork for transnational refueling routes—setting the stage for long-haul flights powered by green hydrogen.

Ecosystem & Collateral Impact

This research isn’t just aviation’s next big thing. The advances in insulation materials and diagnostic sensors could reshape cryogenic hydrogen handling for shipping, heavy industry and LNG terminals—supercharging broader sustainable energy agendas. Nestled in South Holland, TU Delft taps into a rich cluster of aerospace leaders, cryogenics experts, port operators and agile SMEs, creating a 360° innovation ecosystem that fast-tracks lab-to-hangar transitions.

On the policy front, the team’s findings will feed into upcoming EU funding calls, safety frameworks and vocational training programs. Expect early revisions to airport fire codes, fresh incentives for hydrogen corridors and a blueprint for public-private partnerships that regions worldwide may copy.

Regional test facilities and specialized cryogenics workshops mean prototypes can move from drawing boards to real-world testing in record time, underscoring Europe’s competitive edge in industrial decarbonization tech.

What’s Next

Looking ahead, the team aims to complete its 200-liter test tank by early 2026 and kick off integration trials on a hybrid propulsion demonstrator at TU Delft’s custom test bench—pushing the limits with repeated cycles and stress tests. By late 2027, a flight-ready tank prototype should be taxiing under a light aircraft developed by a European partner, setting the stage for full-scale commercial adoption by 2028. And just around the corner, they plan to launch a spin-off venture to commercialize advanced insulation modules and sensor suites, targeting both aviation and adjacent industries.

Investor Insights

If you’ve got your eye on the hydrogen value chain, thermal insulation and two-phase flow control are where the magic happens. Watch for patent filings starting in 2026—they could mark prime moments for strategic partnerships or licensing deals. Better boil-off numbers and fortified safety margins don’t just trim operational expenses—they also help lower insurance premiums for fueling stations and on-board systems, a crucial factor often overlooked in project finance models. Plus, expect venture capital interest to ramp up as the tech proves out in pilot trials.

Final Thought

Tackling the nitty-gritty of hydrogen storage in aviation is a tall order, but if Dr. Chiara Falsetti and TU Delft deliver on their Vidi grant goals, we could see the first blueprint for cryogenic hydrogen flight go live before 2030. As the EU pushes for a 10% sustainable aviation fuel blend by that year and aims for hydrogen-powered routes by 2040, this work could be the missing piece turning lofty policy aspirations into concrete, clean-sky reality—cementing Europe’s lead in zero-emission technology.",https://www.hydrogenfuelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TUDELF.jpeg,N,,2025-10-30 14:03:18.704686

SAF and SAF EAs will be sourced through a transparent competitive tender process from SAF suppliers that meet international sustainability standards like CORSIA.
With predictable cashflows from the SAF levy, SAFCo will be able to go into longer-term, competitive price agreements to secure a more stable and affordable SAF supply.
SAFCo will also build a scalable voluntary demand program for SAF and SAF EAs as a complement to the SAF levy.","The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore announced Oct. 30 that it has set up the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company Ltd. (SAFCo) to centrally procure sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for the Singapore air hub and support the implementation of Singapore’s national SAF policy.

SAFCo is set up as a nonprofit wholly owned by CAAS.

Han Kok Juan, director-general of CAAS, will chair SAFCo’s board.

Tan Seow Hui, a seasoned leader in the energy and aviation industries, has been appointed as its founding CEO.

The setting up of SAFCo follows the passing of the CAAS bill in parliament Oct. 14, which allows for the implementation of SAF policies for air transport in Singapore and empowers CAAS to collect a levy on SAF, to set up a fund for SAF and to procure, manage and allocate SAF and SAF environmental attributes (EAs) or to establish and appoint a central-procurement entity to carry out these functions.

More details on the SAF levy amounts will be shared later.

Through SAFCo, CAAS said it seeks to build a transparent and integrated SAF demand market that brings together airlines, corporate buyers of SAF, fuel producers, carbon market platforms and stakeholders across the aviation fuel chain in Singapore to aggregate demand, stimulate investment and accelerate the use of SAF.

SAFCo will centrally procure SAF using the SAF fund to achieve the 1 percent SAF target in 2026 for flights departing Singapore.

The amount of SAF procured by SAFCo will increase accordingly when the SAF target is raised to 3 percent to 5 percent by 2030, subject to global developments and the wider availability and adoption of SAF.

SAF and SAF EAs will be sourced through a transparent competitive tender process from SAF suppliers that meet international sustainability standards like CORSIA.

With predictable cashflows from the SAF levy, SAFCo will be able to go into longer-term, competitive price agreements to secure a more stable and affordable SAF supply.

Beyond the regulated demand from the SAF levy, SAFCo will also aggregate voluntary SAF demand from organizations seeking to purchase SAF to reduce their air travel or supply-chain carbon footprint credibly and cost effectively.

The demand from the SAF levy forms a scalable baseload, enabling SAFCo to negotiate attractive pricing for SAF and SAF EAs, and to anchor long-term supply agreements.

Businesses that participate in SAFCo’s voluntary SAF purchases can leverage this baseload to unlock economies of scale.

They can also gain access to competitively priced and verified SAF and SAF EAs through SAFCo and avoid the need to set up their own procurement systems.

As a new entity, SAFCo’s immediate priorities will be to establish robust governance and procurement frameworks, set up levy-collection systems and processes and build manpower and procurement capability, while engaging stakeholders on the implementation ahead of the first SAF procurement in 2026.

SAFCo will also build a scalable voluntary demand program for SAF and SAF EAs as a complement to the SAF levy.

SAFCo will reach out to businesses and airlines to encourage them to partner with SAFCo and use its central-procurement mechanism for voluntary SAF purchases.

Conversations are ongoing and CAAS said SAFCo will provide more details on the side of the Singapore Airshow in February.

SAFCo will also support the development of the SAF supply ecosystem in Singapore and the region.

With predictable and stable cashflows, SAFCo can sign longer and larger contracts with SAF suppliers, providing demand certainty in a still-nascent SAF market.

This approach aims to encourage investment in SAF production capacity and the development of SAF-related carbon markets in Singapore and the region.

“Singapore is taking a pragmatic, balanced and action-oriented approach to advancing sustainability in the aviation sector,” CAAS Director-General Han said. “The setting up of SAFCo is another concrete step forward. Through SAFCo, we want to get the best value for the SAF levy collected and activate the SAF ecosystem, which will help advance sustainable aviation and create new economic opportunities for Singapore and beyond.”

SAFCo CEO Tan added, “I am honored to lead SAFCo at this pivotal stage. My priority will be to put in place credible and scalable frameworks, partnerships and processes to ensure that SAFCo delivers on its mandate to aggregate demand, procure SAF efficiently and manage SAF EAs transparently. By working closely with airlines, businesses and suppliers, we aim to facilitate greater SAF adoption in the region and contribute to the decarbonization of aviation.”","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_8f35980592634d00b4e5e2842c85ff81~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_967,h_725,al_c,q_85/80995f_8f35980592634d00b4e5e2842c85ff81~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-10-30 15:00:14.921766

CAAS director-general Han Kok Juan will chair SAFCo’s board, with Tan Seow Hui—formerly of Shell’s low-carbon solutions division—serving as chief executive. The company will begin operations in 2026 with about 10 staff and initial start-up costs covered by CAAS. According to The Straits Times, the levy will be applied to outbound flights based on distance and travel class, with early estimates ranging from S$3 for short-haul flights to S$16 for long-haul routes. The approach, officials said, ensures predictable costs for airlines while providing stable demand for SAF suppliers in a still-developing market.

CAAS aims for sustainable fuel to make up 1 percent of total jet fuel used at Singapore’s airports by 2026, rising to between 3 and 5 percent by 2030.

Now, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have discovered a novel way to address that problem—by converting food waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that meets industry standards without relying on fossil fuel blends. Their process, described in a new Nature Communications study, could help the aviation industry meet its ambitious goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The process in a nutshell is this: The researchers convert food waste into biocrude oil through a thermochemical conversion process called hydrothermal liquefaction, or HTL. Next, they remove impurities from the biocrude oil, and finally, they refine it with the use of hydrogen and catalysts to turn it into aviation fuel.

This approach can be applied to a variety of feedstocks and types of oil, potentially leading to a new direction for obtaining fuels.

“HTL basically mimics the natural formation of crude oil in the Earth. It uses high heat and pressure to convert wet biomass into a biocrude oil. The goal of this work is to upgrade that biocrude oil into transportation fuels that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure,” said lead author Sabrina Summers, who recently graduated with a doctoral degree from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE), part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences and The Grainger College of Engineering at U. of I.

In this project, the researchers used waste from a nearby food processing facility. Globally, over 30% of food is wasted annually at all levels of the supply chain — from farm to transportation, processing, retail, food service, and households. Food decomposition in landfills and wastewater treatment plants further contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and recycling waste helps promote sustainability.

But HTL can process feedstock from a wide range of biowaste, including food, sewage sludge, algal bloom, swine manure, and agricultural residue.

“To meet the aviation industry’s goals to decarbonate jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,” said ABE professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang.

To convert biocrude oil into jet fuel, the researchers first removed impurities such as moisture, ash, and salt. They then used a process called catalytic hydrotreating to eliminate unwanted elements like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur—leaving behind only the hydrocarbons needed for fuel. After testing dozens of options, they identified cobalt molybdenum as the most effective commercially available catalyst to drive the necessary chemical reactions and refine the oil into sustainable aviation fuel.",,N,,2025-10-30 10:56:11.152487

The Tam Anh Research Institute has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the International Health and Tropical Medicine Group from the Nuffield Department of Medicine, establishing the Tam Anh Oxford Partnership (TOP). The partnership promotes equitable collaboration through joint training, research and capacity building, with a focus on innovations in diagnostics and preventive healthcare for non-communicable diseases.

TOP redefines global health collaboration by putting local leadership and needs priorities at the heart of its design, with Oxford contributing world-class research expertise and training to inform national policies and programmes.

Professor Proochista Araiana, Programme Director, International Health and Tropical Medicine, said: ‘We are delighted to be launching this innovative partnership between Tam Anh, one of Vietnam’s leading private healthcare and vaccine establishments, and Oxford University. This is an exciting time for such a collaboration given Vietnam’s rapid economic growth, epidemiological transition, and national prioritisation for healthcare innovations. TOP exemplifies Oxford’s agenda to extend our research excellence while cultivating strategic and equitable international partnerships to tackle global challenges.’

A further partnership between VietJet and Oxford Net Zero, led by Professor Myles Allen, supports the Net Zero Aviation Project — a £1.6 million research collaboration running until mid-2026.

The project, conducted with the International Air Transport Association (IATA), investigates geologically balanced fuels (GBFs) — a novel approach to offsetting aviation emissions by capturing and permanently storing equivalent CO₂ in geological formations. Emissions from aviation are projected to increase steadily in the coming years, and they are currently some of the hardest emissions to abate. The aim of the Net Zero Aviation Project is to look at a potential new way of tackling this challenge by looking at the feasibility, public perception and impact of GBFs, alongside equity and justice implications. It ultimately aims to develop policies and reporting standards which support gradually increasing the fraction of emissions captured and stored over time through cooperation between the aviation sector and their fuel suppliers.

Professor Myles Allen, Principal Investigator of Oxford Net Zero, said: ‘The Oxford Net Zero initiative is delighted to be working with VietJet and the International Air Travel Association, IATA, on strategies for neutralising the climate impact of aviation. We are specifically exploring the concept of “geologically balanced fuels” as potentially an affordable, scalable, and responsible complement to sustainable aviation fuel. Working with a low-cost carrier with a commitment to both sustainability and affordability that is based in South East Asia, one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets, brings together in microcosm all the challenges faced by the global aviation sector.’

What is the SAF RCM and why is the consultation significant?

Back in May 2025, the UK government confirmed its intention to introduce – alongside the demand-driver of the SAF Mandate on which more details are available in our article here – an RCM for SAF with the aim of providing investors with the confidence needed to invest time and capital in the development of SAF projects.

The RCM is proposed to take the form of a government-backed ‘revenue certainty contract’ and it is rumoured that the contract counterparty will be the government’s Low Carbon Contracts Company (the counterparty to electricity market Contracts for Difference (CFD)). The RCM contract will guarantee a fixed price (or strike price) for SAF and like the electricity market CFD, SAF producers would receive top up payments where the SAF price received is less than the strike price and would be obliged to make difference payments where they receive a market price above the strike price. It is still to be determined quite how the market price will be calculated.

The government was clear that the costs of the RCM should be borne by the sector through a new variable levy on aviation fuel suppliers that sits alongside existing obligations under the SAF and this consultation seeks views on both the levy’s design and administration.

The Design of the Aviation Fuel Supplier Levy

The consultation sets out several key intended design features of the Aviation Fuel Supplier Levy, namely:

Market share-based contributions: suppliers will be subject to pay proportional charges based on their individual contribution to the volume of fossil aviation fuel supplied in the UK.

Minimum thresholds: suppliers supplying volumes of fossil aviation fuel below 15.9TJ (equivalent to 468,000 litres annually) will be exempt. This is the only exemption proposed to the levy at present.

Forecasting: A rolling 12-month forecast of levy rates is proposed to aid business planning – although this may be subject to change following scheme maturity.

The consultation also seeks views on: (1) the length of the period over which contributions are assessed; (2) the frequency at which levies collected; and (3) the sequencing of the levy’s assessment, collection and billing periods.

Risks and Enforcement

Contingency planning

As the levy will fund the actual cost of the operation of the RCM, the government has decided that the levy will need to be calculated and collected based on forecasts of the scheme costs and then reconciled when actuals become available. This presents the risk that the forecast levy amounts imposed on a supplier are insufficient to cover their proportion of the total scheme costs. To mitigate this under-collection risk, the consultation proposes applying an additional contingency amount on the levy to compensate for uncertainty in the scheme cost forecasts and help to cover any unforeseen costs.

The consultation also includes proposals in relation to over-collection (i.e. when the counterparty levies a greater amount on a supplier than required to cover their proportion of the total scheme costs) and how these will be repaid.

Supplier default

To address the risk of a supplier defaulting on its levy payment obligations, the consultation suggests two mechanisms:

Credit cover: this is a requirement for suppliers to provide a “back-up” for their levy obligations. The consultation suggests that this could be done either through standby letters of credit, cash or a mixture of the two which are placed on either a monthly or quarterly period.

Mutualisation: this refers to the process of spreading the outstanding levy contributions amongst the remaining compliant suppliers where the credit cover is insufficient.

Enforcement Actions

The consultation outlines several potential enforcement tools to ensure compliance with obligations under the Aviation Fuel Supplier Levy based on those which have proved successful in other schemes, including:

Notices of non-compliance: the counterparty will, where necessary, issue formal notices where the supplier has failed to meet its obligations under the levy. This will include information on remedial actions and further enforcement which may be required;

Reporting of compliance and enforcement: publicly reporting on non-compliance to ensure there is transparency, accountability, proportionate enforcement and ensure there is a reputational deterrent;

Interest on late payments: to incentivise timely payments;

Financial penalties: a power for the Secretary of State to issue a supplier with a financial penalty (currently stated in the SAF Bill to be the lesser of either £100,000 or 10% of annual turnover of the supplier).

Next Steps

The consultation offers a crucial opportunity for key stakeholders such as project developers, fuel suppliers, airlines and airports to influence the levy’s design and implementation. The consultation period is open until 8 January 2026. The consultation document and details on how to respond can be found here.

The government’s consultation response is expected later in 2026. That response will inform the development of secondary legislation which will provide the detail of the RCM. The SAF Bill, which will provide the legislative framework for those regulations is going through parliamentary process (with its second reading in the House of Lords scheduled for the end of November 2025) and is expected to receive Royal Assent (and become law) before the end of 2026.

For example, for HEFA—indeed, a feed-limited pathway to SAF—Flexiforming can convert their low-value byproduct, naphtha, into the aromatic component of SAF.

Unifuel’s model is based on technology licensing rather than direct fuel production, which makes scaling faster and more capital-efficient.
By enabling modular, regional SAF production, Flexiforming helps producers reduce transportation costs and make better use of local renewable resources.","In an exclusive AgroSpectrum interview, Alexei Beltyukov, CEO and Co-founder of Universal Fuel Technologies (Unifuel), elucidates how the company’s proprietary Flexiforming process transcends the constraints of conventional waste-oil-based biofuels, converting alcohols and low-value refinery byproducts into truly drop-in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). By delivering the elusive aromatic fraction required for jet engine performance — something HEFA and Fischer–Tropsch routes cannot independently supply — Unifuel simultaneously augments yield and slashes both energy and hydrogen inputs.

Beltyukov underscores that Flexiforming’s modularity and compatibility with existing refineries and ethanol facilities offer a capital-efficient scale-up pathway at a time when the SAF markets are beleaguered by feedstock scarcity and punishing production costs. Policy acceleration toward 100 per cent synthetic SAF approval, coupled with long-term airline offtake agreements, he argues, will unlock the confidence necessary for global deployment. Ultimately, Unifuel positions itself not as a solitary panacea but as a catalytic enabler of a commercially viable, climate-positive aviation future, where complementary pathways collaborate to maximise every molecule of renewable carbon.

I. Technology & Production

From Waste to Jet Fuel:

Can you explain the core technology behind Unifuel’s conversion of waste oils and fats into SAF, and what differentiates it from conventional biofuel pathways?

Unifuel doesn’t directly convert waste oils and fats into SAF. Rather, our Flexiforming technology complements existing processes that do. We convert alcohols like ethanol and methanol into high-quality SAF, and we upgrade the low-value byproducts—naphtha and LPG—from Hydroprocessed Esthers and Fatty Acids (HEFA) and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) processes that use waste oils and fats.

The key differentiator is our single-step, all-gas phase reaction using a proprietary catalyst. This design reduces energy consumption by 75 per cent and hydrogen requirements by 33 per cent compared to alternative ethanol-to-jet processes, positioning our technology at approximately half the cost. Additionally, we produce aromatic SAF components that HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch cannot, which are essential for jet engine performance and achieving true drop-in capability.

Performance and Sustainability:

How do Unifuel’s SAF products perform in terms of energy density, combustion efficiency, and lifecycle carbon intensity compared to fossil-based jet fuels?

Flexiforming produces SAF that is chemically comparable to conventional jet fuel, containing the 8-25 per cent aromatics that today’s aircraft engines require. Our SAF has undergone comprehensive testing at Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab—the world-leading authority on SAF research—and has been accepted into the ASTM D4054 Clearinghouse for qualification. This acceptance demonstrates that our fuel meets strict quality and safety criteria and shows strong potential for completing the ASTM qualification process successfully.

In terms of lifecycle carbon intensity, depending on the specific chemical pathway, our energy-efficient process has a carbon intensity 10-31 per cent that of the incoming feedstock—a significant reduction beyond the inherent benefits of using renewable feedstocks.

II. Scaling Challenges

Feedstock Constraints:

Waste oils and fats are finite and geographically dispersed. What strategies is Unifuel pursuing to secure a consistent, scalable feedstock supply, and how do logistics impact production economics?

Rather than competing for limited HEFA feedstocks, our strategy is to make the best of what’s available and diversify. For example, for HEFA—indeed, a feed-limited pathway to SAF—Flexiforming can convert their low-value byproduct, naphtha, into the aromatic component of SAF. Apart from making the product a potentially fully synthetic fungible jet fuel (subject to ASTM approvals), this produces 20 per cent more SAF from the same amount of feedstock. Flexiforming works with any alcohol or ether, renewable naphthas, and LPG. This versatility allows plant operators to adapt to feedstock availability and pricing fluctuations.

For ethanol specifically, we see significant opportunity. The U.S. already produces billions of gallons of ethanol annually for gasoline blending. As electric vehicles replace gasoline-powered cars, this ethanol can be redirected to jet fuel production without impacting food production or requiring new agricultural investment. Flexiforming offers ethanol plant operators an economically viable ethanol-to-jet pathway, 50 per cent less expensive than existing ETJ options.

Refinery and Conversion Economics:

What are the key technical and economic bottlenecks in scaling SAF production from laboratory or pilot-scale to commercial refinery operations, and how is Unifuel addressing them ?

The primary bottlenecks are cost (SAF currently costs 2 to 4 times more than conventional jet fuel) and feedstock limitations. Our single-reactor design dramatically reduces capital and operational costs. Flexiforming is also designed for scalable deployment at various sizes, from small bolt-on units for Fischer-Tropsch plants to large refinery-scale installations. This flexibility allows producers to match their investment to their specific circumstances rather than requiring massive upfront capital. Critically, we integrate with existing infrastructure, minimizing deployment costs and accelerating time to market. Our successful 2024 five-month pilot campaign demonstrates we’ve moved beyond laboratory concepts closer to commercially proven, reproducible technology.

III. Policy & Market Dynamics

Regulatory Alignment:

How do government incentives, blending mandates, and carbon credit schemes influence SAF adoption, and where do you see regulatory gaps that need urgent attention to accelerate deployment ?

Similar to how EVs initially depended on government incentives before becoming mainstream, SAF needs policy support to offset the current cost premium and give producers confidence to invest.

The next step we are awaiting in the regulatory area is the adoption of a standard for 100 per cent drop-in, fully synthetic SAF. Currently, ASTM standards allow most SAF to be blended with conventional jet fuel up to 50 per cent . The industry anticipates approval for 100 per cent synthetic SAF by the end of 2026, but this requires addressing the aromatics requirement—something HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch alone cannot provide.

Technologies that can produce aromatic SAF components should receive accelerated regulatory review and support, as they’re essential for eliminating the need for continued blending with fossil fuels.

Global Market Readiness:

With airlines increasingly committing to SAF targets, what is your perspective on the readiness of global supply chains and airport infrastructure to handle large-scale SAF integration?

Infrastructure is largely in place to support greater use of SAF, since it is a “drop-in” replacement that works with today’s aircraft. Once the fully synthetic SAF standard is adopted, common-carrier pipelines and all other infrastructure will be accessible to SAF. The real challenge is scaling production to meet growing demand. SAF currently represents less than 1 per cent of global jet fuel consumption, and closing that gap will depend on both technologies that make existing production pathways more efficient and cost-effective, as well as the regulatory approach.

A lot of capacity and feedstock that can be used to make SAF are presently targeting renewable diesel. This is a partial result of how the tax incentives are set up, and also of the fact that when making SAF, the producers inevitably make significant quantities of naphtha – a byproduct that, in the absence of Flexiforming, has a relatively low value.

Flexiforming helps in exactly that way. By upgrading low-value byproducts such as naphtha and LPG into additional SAF, our technology enables producers to generate more fuel from the same feedstock. This increases total output while improving project economics, which in turn helps airlines and fuel suppliers meet their sustainability commitments more quickly and affordably.

IV. Strategic Outlook

Investment and Partnership Models:

What role do strategic airline partnerships, venture capital, and private equity play in enabling SAF scale-up, and what frameworks have you found most effective for attracting long-term investment?

Strategic partnerships are critical, especially between technology providers, fuel producers, and airlines. Airlines’ long-term offtake agreements provide the demand certainty investors look for, while venture and private equity partners can fund early deployment.

Unifuel’s model is based on technology licensing rather than direct fuel production, which makes scaling faster and more capital-efficient. Our customers can integrate Flexiforming into their existing plants with relatively low CapEx, creating a more distributed, resilient SAF supply network. This model appeals to investors because it allows them to participate across multiple facilities and feedstocks, reducing risk while accelerating market penetration.

Beyond Waste Oils:

As SAF demand grows, how is Unifuel preparing for feedstock diversification — for example, algae, municipal waste, or other renewable sources — and what technical or economic hurdles remain in that transition ?

Feedstock diversification is at the heart of Flexiforming’s value proposition. We can already process any naphtha, alcohol or ether, so as new pathways to these feeds emerge—from algae, cellulosic sources, or other biomass—we can potentially integrate them.

For municipal and agricultural waste, we complement Fischer-Tropsch processing. By upgrading FT’s naphtha and LPG byproducts into aromatic SAF, we can increase plant revenue by 10-20 per cent, making waste-to-SAF projects more financially viable.

The main challenge is not chemistry, but logistics and preprocessing costs. That’s why our technology can be deployed at different scales, even near the source of biomass or waste conversion. By enabling modular, regional SAF production, Flexiforming helps producers reduce transportation costs and make better use of local renewable resources.

Vision for Net-Zero Aviation:

Looking ahead 5–10 years, how do you see Unifuel contributing to a commercially viable, climate-positive aviation sector, and what are the key milestones the industry must hit to achieve that vision?

We envision three major use cases: bolt-ons to Fischer-Tropsch and HEFA plants processing waste feedstocks; partnerships with ethanol plants transitioning from selling ethanol for gasoline blending to SAF; and retrofitting existing oil refineries for SAF production.

The key industry milestones include ASTM approval for 100 per cent drop-in synthetic SAF by end of 2026; achieving economic parity or near-parity with conventional jet fuel through technology improvements and policy support; and successfully diversifying beyond limited HEFA feedstocks.

Our goal is for Flexiforming to become a mainstream enabling technology—recognizing that no single pathway will meet 100 per cent of demand, but that complementary technologies working together can maximize resource utilization and make sustainable aviation the norm rather than the exception.

The agreement makes United the first commercial airline to procure SAF for flights leaving George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey and Dulles International Airport in Washington DC.

The development represents a critical step in sourcing alternative fuels within the aviation sector.

Lauren Riley, Chief Sustainability Officer at United, emphasised the importance of taking action: ""In this moment, we'll be judged by our actions – not our words. And at United Airlines, progress is everything.

""Last week marked a milestone for advancing sustainable aviation fuel: for the first time ever, SAF is now flowing to three new airports – Newark, Dulles and Houston.""

According to the agreement, Neste began deliveries to Houston in July for a term ending in October 2025. Deliveries to Newark and Dulles started in September and are set to continue until the end of 2025.

Leveraging infrastructure for SAF delivery

The deployment of the SAF relies on existing pipeline infrastructure from Neste's SAF terminal facilities in Houston.

From there, neat Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel is blended with conventional jet fuel to meet the required aviation specifications.

While aviation represents a smaller portion of global emissions compared to other industries, it is considered one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonise.

This is due to the need for technological innovation across low-emission fuel production, aircraft and engine improvements and operational optimisation.

Policy incentives and market growth

Securing a stable and scalable supply of SAF remains a major challenge, with government support often playing a crucial role.

Lauren acknowledges the sector's dependence on policy incentives to aid its decarbonisation efforts.

""While United remains the leading SAF user in the U.S., using over 4,300 metric tons (13 million gallons) last year, we recognise that the growth of the SAF market requires support from both state and federal governments,"" she explains.

The coordination required to achieve this supply milestone was substantial.

Lauren adds: ""This didn't happen easily or overnight. It took relentless coordination, innovation and a team that refused to settle for 'good enough.' But we did it – because meaningful change demands action.""

For procurement executives, the main concerns in the SAF market centre on availability and cost alongside geopolitical tensions and tariffs linked to growing protectionism.

Carl Nyberg, Senior Vice President of Commercial Renewable Products at Neste, stresses the necessity of supportive policies: ""It is crucial that more states enact proven incentive policy frameworks to accelerate the production of SAF and support the aviation industry towards its net-zero carbon emission goal by 2050.""

Production capacity and emissions reduction

This partnership builds on previous collaboration between United and Neste.

Neste has supplied SAF to United at Chicago O'Hare International Airport since August 2024 after Illinois enacted a SAF purchase credit. The fuel has also been used at San Francisco International Airport, where California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard supports the adoption of renewable fuels.

Neste's current global SAF production capability stands at 1.5 million tons, or approximately 515 million gallons, per year.

Neste has plans to expand this capacity to 2.2 million tons (around 750 million gallons) by 2027.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/e3d2a8518a6d3ed6408b9bb7e751544c:8ced8d92e3889b0bf173ff61d31debbc/united-airlines.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 09:56:45.887376

In the U.S., the SAF Grand Challenge aims to expand domestic consumption of SAF to 3 billion gallons per year by 2030 and 35 billion gallons per year by 2050.

In Europe,the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates that SAF make up 2% of all jet fuel by 2025, rising to 6% in 2030, 20% by 2035, and 70% by 2050, creating one of the largest mandated clean-fuel markets globally.

The UK has coupled mandates starting from 2% in 2025 and increasing to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040 with revenue-certainty mechanisms that help cover the price premium between SAF and conventional jet fuel.

Across Asia-Pacific, countries including Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea, and Singapore are developing frameworks that combine blending targets, tax incentives, and infrastructure funding to stimulate both production and demand.

For airports worldwide, a top priority is scaling up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for all aircrafts. SAF has the potential to dramatically reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% per lifecycle compared to traditional jet fuels. As one of the busiest airports on the West Coast, PDX is committed to leading this transition in cooperation with the international airports in Seattle and Vancouver, BC, who we have a joint decarbonization agreement with. By implementing SAF, we can significantly decrease our airport operation’s carbon footprint and set an example for global aviation. This shift not only supports our local and global climate goals but also encourages airlines to adopt greener practices. The widespread adoption of SAF would be a game-changer, reducing the aviation industry's overall impact on climate change and fostering a more sustainable future for air travel.

What’s one sustainability effort you personally will try to adopt in the next year?

Portland, Oregon, has a world-renowned food scene—from our fresh seafood and fruit to our revered chefs and wine, I truly live in foodie heaven. Now, my family and I are committing to using our unrivaled options to land on a more climate-friendly diet. This means reducing the number of meat-centric meals I eat in a week, seeking out locally grown products to minimize transportation, and prioritizing organic and sustainable farming practices. Supporting local farmers not only reduces the environmental impact of transporting food over long distances, but it also strengthens our local economy. Adopting these practices allows us to make a meaningful contribution to the fight against climate change, one meal at a time.

What is a climate solution that isn't getting the attention or funding it deserves?

I live in the American West, and for my community the clear climate crisis that urgently needs attention is the rise of increasingly devastating wildfires and the dangerous smoke they produce. The deadly 2020 Labor Day Fires in Oregon ripped through more than a million acres, burning several towns to the ground. That same year in neighboring California, the state emitted more greenhouse gases in just one year than it had previously eliminated through 18 years of carbon-reduction efforts—effectively erasing nearly two decades of progress. Yet, despite their scale and impact, emissions from wildfires are often excluded from official inventories. Wildfire smoke is also emerging as the deadliest climate-related health threat in the U.S.

It is impossible to overstate the personal and economic toll these fires are taking across the West, and our leaders must meet the moment. That means seriously prioritizing wildfire mitigation, forest resilience, smoke mitigation, and emissions accounting. Investing in these wildfire reduction efforts is not optional—it is essential in our fight against climate change.

What gives you hope about the future of the planet?

Local innovations fueling creative climate solutions. This was the Port of Portland’s North Star as we united the talents of people from across the Pacific Northwest to build PDX’s new state-of-the-art terminal. Together, we are doubling the airport’s size, yet cutting our energy use in half by using the latest in local, sustainably sourced designs and upgrades.

By delivering the elusive aromatic fraction required for jet engine performance — something HEFA and Fischer–Tropsch routes cannot independently supply — Unifuel simultaneously augments yield and slashes both energy and hydrogen inputs.

Beltyukov underscores that Flexiforming’s modularity and compatibility with existing refineries and ethanol facilities offer a capital-efficient scale-up pathway at a time when the SAF markets are beleaguered by feedstock scarcity and punishing production costs. Policy acceleration toward 100 per cent synthetic SAF approval, coupled with long-term airline offtake agreements, he argues, will unlock the confidence necessary for global deployment. Ultimately, Unifuel positions itself not as a solitary panacea but as a catalytic enabler of a commercially viable, climate-positive aviation future, where complementary pathways collaborate to maximise every molecule of renewable carbon.

I. Technology & Production

From Waste to Jet Fuel:

Can you explain the core technology behind Unifuel’s conversion of waste oils and fats into SAF, and what differentiates it from conventional biofuel pathways?

Unifuel doesn’t directly convert waste oils and fats into SAF. Rather, our Flexiforming technology complements existing processes that do. We convert alcohols like ethanol and methanol into high-quality SAF, and we upgrade the low-value byproducts—naphtha and LPG—from Hydroprocessed Esthers and Fatty Acids (HEFA) and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) processes that use waste oils and fats.

The key differentiator is our single-step, all-gas phase reaction using a proprietary catalyst. This design reduces energy consumption by 75 per cent and hydrogen requirements by 33 per cent compared to alternative ethanol-to-jet processes, positioning our technology at approximately half the cost. Additionally, we produce aromatic SAF components that HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch cannot, which are essential for jet engine performance and achieving true drop-in capability.

Performance and Sustainability:

How do Unifuel’s SAF products perform in terms of energy density, combustion efficiency, and lifecycle carbon intensity compared to fossil-based jet fuels?

Flexiforming produces SAF that is chemically comparable to conventional jet fuel, containing the 8-25 per cent aromatics that today’s aircraft engines require. Our SAF has undergone comprehensive testing at Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab—the world-leading authority on SAF research—and has been accepted into the ASTM D4054 Clearinghouse for qualification. This acceptance demonstrates that our fuel meets strict quality and safety criteria and shows strong potential for completing the ASTM qualification process successfully.

In terms of lifecycle carbon intensity, depending on the specific chemical pathway, our energy-efficient process has a carbon intensity 10-31 per cent that of the incoming feedstock—a significant reduction beyond the inherent benefits of using renewable feedstocks.

II. Scaling Challenges

Feedstock Constraints:

Waste oils and fats are finite and geographically dispersed. What strategies is Unifuel pursuing to secure a consistent, scalable feedstock supply, and how do logistics impact production economics?

Rather than competing for limited HEFA feedstocks, our strategy is to make the best of what’s available and diversify. For example, for HEFA—indeed, a feed-limited pathway to SAF—Flexiforming can convert their low-value byproduct, naphtha, into the aromatic component of SAF. Apart from making the product a potentially fully synthetic fungible jet fuel (subject to ASTM approvals), this produces 20 per cent more SAF from the same amount of feedstock. Flexiforming works with any alcohol or ether, renewable naphthas, and LPG. This versatility allows plant operators to adapt to feedstock availability and pricing fluctuations.

For ethanol specifically, we see significant opportunity. The U.S. already produces billions of gallons of ethanol annually for gasoline blending. As electric vehicles replace gasoline-powered cars, this ethanol can be redirected to jet fuel production without impacting food production or requiring new agricultural investment. Flexiforming offers ethanol plant operators an economically viable ethanol-to-jet pathway, 50 per cent less expensive than existing ETJ options.

Refinery and Conversion Economics:

What are the key technical and economic bottlenecks in scaling SAF production from laboratory or pilot-scale to commercial refinery operations, and how is Unifuel addressing them ?

The primary bottlenecks are cost (SAF currently costs 2 to 4 times more than conventional jet fuel) and feedstock limitations. Our single-reactor design dramatically reduces capital and operational costs. Flexiforming is also designed for scalable deployment at various sizes, from small bolt-on units for Fischer-Tropsch plants to large refinery-scale installations. This flexibility allows producers to match their investment to their specific circumstances rather than requiring massive upfront capital. Critically, we integrate with existing infrastructure, minimizing deployment costs and accelerating time to market. Our successful 2024 five-month pilot campaign demonstrates we’ve moved beyond laboratory concepts closer to commercially proven, reproducible technology.

III. Policy & Market Dynamics

Regulatory Alignment:

How do government incentives, blending mandates, and carbon credit schemes influence SAF adoption, and where do you see regulatory gaps that need urgent attention to accelerate deployment ?

Similar to how EVs initially depended on government incentives before becoming mainstream, SAF needs policy support to offset the current cost premium and give producers confidence to invest.

The next step we are awaiting in the regulatory area is the adoption of a standard for 100 per cent drop-in, fully synthetic SAF. Currently, ASTM standards allow most SAF to be blended with conventional jet fuel up to 50 per cent . The industry anticipates approval for 100 per cent synthetic SAF by the end of 2026, but this requires addressing the aromatics requirement—something HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch alone cannot provide.

Technologies that can produce aromatic SAF components should receive accelerated regulatory review and support, as they’re essential for eliminating the need for continued blending with fossil fuels.

Global Market Readiness:

With airlines increasingly committing to SAF targets, what is your perspective on the readiness of global supply chains and airport infrastructure to handle large-scale SAF integration?

Infrastructure is largely in place to support greater use of SAF, since it is a “drop-in” replacement that works with today’s aircraft. Once the fully synthetic SAF standard is adopted, common-carrier pipelines and all other infrastructure will be accessible to SAF. The real challenge is scaling production to meet growing demand. SAF currently represents less than 1 per cent of global jet fuel consumption, and closing that gap will depend on both technologies that make existing production pathways more efficient and cost-effective, as well as the regulatory approach.

A lot of capacity and feedstock that can be used to make SAF are presently targeting renewable diesel. This is a partial result of how the tax incentives are set up, and also of the fact that when making SAF, the producers inevitably make significant quantities of naphtha – a byproduct that, in the absence of Flexiforming, has a relatively low value.

Flexiforming helps in exactly that way. By upgrading low-value byproducts such as naphtha and LPG into additional SAF, our technology enables producers to generate more fuel from the same feedstock. This increases total output while improving project economics, which in turn helps airlines and fuel suppliers meet their sustainability commitments more quickly and affordably.

IV. Strategic Outlook

Investment and Partnership Models:

What role do strategic airline partnerships, venture capital, and private equity play in enabling SAF scale-up, and what frameworks have you found most effective for attracting long-term investment?

Strategic partnerships are critical, especially between technology providers, fuel producers, and airlines. Airlines’ long-term offtake agreements provide the demand certainty investors look for, while venture and private equity partners can fund early deployment.

Unifuel’s model is based on technology licensing rather than direct fuel production, which makes scaling faster and more capital-efficient. Our customers can integrate Flexiforming into their existing plants with relatively low CapEx, creating a more distributed, resilient SAF supply network. This model appeals to investors because it allows them to participate across multiple facilities and feedstocks, reducing risk while accelerating market penetration.

Beyond Waste Oils:

As SAF demand grows, how is Unifuel preparing for feedstock diversification — for example, algae, municipal waste, or other renewable sources — and what technical or economic hurdles remain in that transition ?

Feedstock diversification is at the heart of Flexiforming’s value proposition. We can already process any naphtha, alcohol or ether, so as new pathways to these feeds emerge—from algae, cellulosic sources, or other biomass—we can potentially integrate them.

For municipal and agricultural waste, we complement Fischer-Tropsch processing. By upgrading FT’s naphtha and LPG byproducts into aromatic SAF, we can increase plant revenue by 10-20 per cent, making waste-to-SAF projects more financially viable.

The main challenge is not chemistry, but logistics and preprocessing costs. That’s why our technology can be deployed at different scales, even near the source of biomass or waste conversion. By enabling modular, regional SAF production, Flexiforming helps producers reduce transportation costs and make better use of local renewable resources.

Vision for Net-Zero Aviation:

Looking ahead 5–10 years, how do you see Unifuel contributing to a commercially viable, climate-positive aviation sector, and what are the key milestones the industry must hit to achieve that vision?

We envision three major use cases: bolt-ons to Fischer-Tropsch and HEFA plants processing waste feedstocks; partnerships with ethanol plants transitioning from selling ethanol for gasoline blending to SAF; and retrofitting existing oil refineries for SAF production.

The key industry milestones include ASTM approval for 100 per cent drop-in synthetic SAF by end of 2026; achieving economic parity or near-parity with conventional jet fuel through technology improvements and policy support; and successfully diversifying beyond limited HEFA feedstocks.

Our goal is for Flexiforming to become a mainstream enabling technology—recognizing that no single pathway will meet 100 per cent of demand, but that complementary technologies working together can maximize resource utilization and make sustainable aviation the norm rather than the exception.",https://agrospectrumindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Flexiforming_SAF_Wallpaper_Alternative.png,N,,2025-10-30 09:57:01.133363

The urgency of this innovation cannot be overstated, as increased air travel has escalated the demand for jet fuel, which is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. The study, published in the esteemed journal Nature Communications, elucidates their unique approach to addressing the aviation sector’s environmental challenges while ensuring that the resulting fuel meets rigorous industry standards without the need for fossil fuel blends.

At the heart of this research is a thermochemical conversion technique known as hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). This innovative process replicates the natural formation of crude oil, applying high heat and pressure to wet biomass, specifically food waste, to synthesize biocrude oil. The versatility of HTL allows it to utilize a broad spectrum of organic materials, making it a promising solution for converting various waste products into valuable energy sources. The successful transformation of food waste into usable fuel exemplifies a crucial step toward sustainability in transportation.

Food waste itself is an alarming global issue, with over 30% of edible food discarded each year across the supply chain—from agricultural production to household waste. This not only exacerbates food insecurity but also contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, especially when waste decomposes in landfills and contaminates water sources. By harnessing this waste through HTL, the researchers not only provide a method for reducing environmental impact but also promote the concept of sustainability in the aviation industry.

The research team meticulously crafted a three-step process to refine biocrude into aviable transport fuel. Initially, impurities such as moisture, ash, and salts are eliminated from the crude oil. Following this purification stage, catalytic hydrotreating is employed to remove unwanted constituents like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. The result is a refined hydrocarbon mix suitable for aviation fuel. This breakthrough not only reutilizes food waste but also addresses the pressing need for cleaner energy alternatives in the aviation sector.

Lead author Sabrina Summers, who recently earned her doctoral degree from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, emphasizes that the effectiveness of their approach is rooted in the selection of suitable catalysts. After experimenting with various options, the researchers designated cobalt molybdenum as the most effective catalyst for facilitating the necessary reactions to refine biocrude into jet fuel. This strategic selection sets this research apart, showcasing the importance of catalyst efficiency in future developments within this field.

Their rigorous testing revealed that the sustainable aviation fuel produced from food waste passed advanced pre-screening tests set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Impressively, this SAF sample adhered to all the specifications required for conventional jet fuel without the need for any additive or blending with fossil fuels. This not only validates their methodology but also positions their innovation as a legitimate contender for commercial aviation fuel.

The scalable nature of this technology bolsters its potential for widespread commercialization. Yuanhui Zhang, a co-author of the study and a professor in the same department, asserts that agriculture will play a critical role in providing the diverse renewable feedstocks necessary to meet aviation’s decarbonization goals. Their method can be utilized to produce various forms of sustainable fuels beyond just jet fuel, paving the way for a broader impact on the energy landscape.

In an era where sustainability is a primary concern, this research contributes meaningfully to the concept of the circular bioeconomy. Unlike conventional processes that adhere to a linear pattern of production and disposal, the approach employed by Zhang and Summers encapsulates the essence of circularity—taking waste materials and converting them into energy and usable products. This not only mitigates waste but also enhances resource efficiency in multiple industries, from aviation to plastics.

The implications of this research extend beyond immediate environmental concerns; they open doors for extensive commercial opportunities. As industry stakeholders grapple with climate change and the imperative to adopt greener practices, innovations like the conversion of food waste into aviation fuel could redefine how we perceive waste and energy production. The potential for growth in this sector is immense, especially as policymakers and the public become increasingly supportive of sustainable initiatives.

Moving forward, the expected impact of this study hinges on continued collaboration between academia and industry. The transition from laboratory successes to commercial viability involves addressing engineering and economic challenges that will arise during the scale-up of such processes. This transition is essential not only for the advancement of SAF but also for broader initiatives aimed at establishing a more sustainable energy economy.

In conclusion, the research conducted at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign stands as a beacon of hope for a future where aviation can coexist harmoniously with environmental sustainability. By harnessing food waste and turning it into a viable energy source, they have not only tackled an existing problem but have also positioned sustainable aviation fuel as a feasible option for the aviation industry’s future. As the world increasingly stands at the crossroads of climate action, innovations such as these are vital roadmaps showing the way forward.

The paper detailing this groundbreaking research, titled “From food waste to sustainable aviation fuel: cobalt molybdenum catalysis of pretreated hydrothermal liquefaction biocrude,” is published in Nature Communications, further legitimizing the methods and impacts discussed. With the backing of the U.S. Department of Energy and support from the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program, this research highlights the integral role that funding and collaboration play in driving scientific advancements.

As we navigate through the challenges posed by climate change, the importance of converting waste into valuable resources cannot be understated. The work at the University of Illinois is a prime example of how innovation and sustainability can blend seamlessly, forging a path toward a cleaner, more sustainable future.

Now, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have discovered a novel way to address that problem—by converting food waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that meets industry standards without relying on fossil fuel blends. Their process, described in a new Nature Communications study, could help the aviation industry meet its ambitious goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The process in a nutshell is this: The researchers convert food waste into biocrude oil through a thermochemical conversion process called hydrothermal liquefaction, or HTL. Next, they remove impurities from the biocrude oil, and finally, they refine it with the use of hydrogen and catalysts to turn it into aviation fuel.

This approach can be applied to a variety of feedstocks and types of oil, potentially leading to a new direction for obtaining fuels.

“HTL basically mimics the natural formation of crude oil in the Earth. It uses high heat and pressure to convert wet biomass into a biocrude oil. The goal of this work is to upgrade that biocrude oil into transportation fuels that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure,” said lead author Sabrina Summers, who recently graduated with a doctoral degree from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE), part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences and The Grainger College of Engineering at U. of I.

In this project, the researchers used waste from a nearby food processing facility. Globally, over 30% of food is wasted annually at all levels of the supply chain — from farm to transportation, processing, retail, food service, and households. Food decomposition in landfills and wastewater treatment plants further contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and recycling waste helps promote sustainability.

But HTL can process feedstock from a wide range of biowaste, including food, sewage sludge, algal bloom, swine manure, and agricultural residue.

“To meet the aviation industry’s goals to decarbonate jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,” said ABE professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang.

To convert biocrude oil into jet fuel, the researchers first removed impurities such as moisture, ash, and salt. They then used a process called catalytic hydrotreating to eliminate unwanted elements like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur—leaving behind only the hydrocarbons needed for fuel. After testing dozens of options, they identified cobalt molybdenum as the most effective commercially available catalyst to drive the necessary chemical reactions and refine the oil into sustainable aviation fuel.

To optimize the hydrotreatment process, the researchers adjusted variables such as temperature, catalyst and hydrogen loads, and retention time to identify the best conditions for producing jet fuel. They then tested their sustainable aviation fuel against rigorous standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration. Their SAF sample passed Tier Alpha and Beta prescreening tests and met all specifications for conventional jet fuel—without requiring any additives or blending with fossil fuels.

The technology has the potential to be scaled up for commercial production, Zhang noted.

“Our research helps solve the science and engineering problems, and then the industry can step in. The process can be applied to other types of oils for SAF. It can also replace other materials, such as petroleum-derived compounds for making plastics. This has huge potential for business opportunities and economic development,” he said.

Zhang has developed an index to measure circular bioeconomy, and he said SAF provides a valuable contribution to circularity.

“In a linear economy, we just produce something, use it, and throw it away. In this project, we take the waste and recover the energy and materials to make a usable product. This fills a missing link in the circular paradigm,” he concluded.",https://www.newswise.com/legacy/image.php?image=/images/uploads/2025/10/29/690230eb16670_SabrinaSummers.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 09:57:19.198305

In this study, it was shown that cobalt molybdenum catalyst effectively upgraded food waste-derived HTL biocrude oil into drop-in SAF.
Despite the improved circularity through producing SAF from food waste, it is apparent that food waste alone will only be part of the solution to provide feedstocks for SAF.
Specifically, municipal solid waste and wet waste (including food waste) is just a fraction of the potential sustainable biomass supply for production of liquid transportation fuels.
Overall, increased recovery of food waste from other waste management practices would most greatly improve the circularity of this HTL-SAF pathway.","Rising energy demand and the negative impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have hastened efforts to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). To achieve the United States’s SAF Grand Challenge of meeting 100% domestic demand for aviation fuel and net-zero carbon emissions, a significant uptake in SAF is required. SAF can form a circular carbon loop that utilizes carbon emissions during production, transportation, and combustion, effectively reducing aviation’s carbon footprint1. Further, aviation represents 2–3% of global GHG emissions and 11% of U.S. GHG emissions2,3. However, SAF can reduce carbon emissions by 80% compared to traditional jet fuel3,4,5, largely due to the use of biogenic waste material, which allows uptake of feedstock to offset combustion carbon emissions from SAF3.

Currently, there are eight SAF production pathways and three co-processing pathways approved by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)6. Synthesized paraffinic kerosene from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA-SPK) is the most mature and least expensive pathway, but it is severely constrained by feedstock availability7. HEFA-SPK hydroprocesses lipid feedstocks, including FOGs, algae, vegetable oils like soybean oil, and seed oils like jatropha. Furthermore, synthesized paraffinic kerosene from hydroprocessed hydrocarbons, esters, and fatty acids (HC-HEFA-SPK) utilizes an additional feedstock, algae oil from Botryococcus braunii, to produce SAF. Fischer-Tropsch hydroprocessed synthesized paraffinic kerosene (FT-SPK) converts woody biomass (e.g., municipal solid waste, agricultural waste, forest/wood residues, energy crops) into syngas through gasification, followed by production of hydrocarbons through FT, and hydroprocessing. The additional production of aromatics (FT-SPK/A) addresses the low aromatics content of FT-SPK fuel through the alkylation of light aromatics with FT-derived olefins. Synthesized isoparaffins from hydroprocessed fermented sugars (HFS-SIP) utilizes microbial conversion of sugars from cellulosic biomass (e.g., corn stover, non-woody biomass, pretreated FOGs), to produce farnesene, which can then be hydroprocessed into isoparaffins. Alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) synthetic paraffinic kerosene produces isobutanol or ethanol via fermentation or gasification of cellulosic biomass, which then undergo dehydration, oligomerization, and hydrogenation to form jet-range hydrocarbons. ATJ synthetic paraffinic kerosene with aromatics (ATJ-SKA) also addresses the low aromatic content of ATJ SAF, deriving aromatics from C2-C5 alcohols through additional dehydration and aromatization steps. Lastly, hydrothermal conversion of fatty acid esters and fatty acids (CHJ) treats waste and energy oils through catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction and hydroprocessing. The blend limit is 50% for all approved pathways, except for HFS-SIP and HC-HEFA SPK, which are limited to 10%. For co-processing, esters and fatty acids, FT hydrocarbons, and HEFA hydrocarbons are hydroprocessed with petroleum in a conventional refinery, limited to 5%, 5%, and 10% blends, respectively.

The utilization of waste biomass plays a significant role in the production of biofuels for the transportation sector and reduction of GHG emissions. Biofuels can be defined as first-generation (edible oil seeds), second-generation (non-edible oil seeds, waste materials), third-generation (algae), and fourth-generation (genetically engineered oil crops) according to their feedstock8. In particular, second-generation feedstocks avoid land use and enable the recovery of carbon and energy from waste streams, presenting a sustainable feedstock for fuel production. Approximately 11% of bio-based energy and chemicals in the U.S. are produced from waste biomass9. Potential biomass feedstocks from waste streams include waste lipids like FOGs (fat, oil, and grease), food waste, algal blooms, sewage sludge, and agricultural and forestry residues. While catalytic hydroprocessing of lipid feedstocks, such as waste cooking oils, is currently the most competitive pathway for renewable diesel and SAF, feedstock sustainability is limited by availability and cost10. One promising feedstock for SAF is food waste, an impactful biomass stream that represents reusable carbon sources for renewable energy applications. In the United States, food waste is the most common discarded material for landfill and incineration11. Over 30% of food is wasted or lost in the global supply chain each year; In 2021, it was reported that 13.2% was lost in the chain from farm to consumer, while an additional 17% was wasted at the consumer level, including households, food service, and retail12. Furthermore, disposal of food waste in landfills has further environmental impacts through GHG emissions during decomposition11. Food waste is an ideal feedstock for hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), a thermochemical conversion method that reacts wet biomass under high heat and pressure to produce biocrude oil, along with aqueous, char, and gaseous byproducts. Compared to other thermochemical technologies, HTL has an economic advantage by using the inherent water content of feedstocks as a reaction medium, thereby avoiding the time-consuming and cost-prohibitive drying pretreatment step13. Moreso, it can convert a broad range of feedstock, including non-lipid components of biomass, such as proteins and carbohydrates14. While HTL biocrude is a promising substitution for liquid petroleum products such as transportation fuels, it possesses several undesirable physicochemical properties that make it unsuitable as a drop-in fuel, including high oxygen content; high viscosity and acidity; and low heating value13,15. Furthermore, biocrude oil derived from biogenic feedstocks contain alkali impurities and sulfur that can cause catalyst deactivation over time16. Nonetheless, HTL’s ability to convert a broad range of feedstocks gives it an advantage over other SAF conversion technologies, such as HEFA-SPK, which is sensitive to feedstock volatility, price, and availability7. For example, the minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of HEFA-SPK in the United States ranged from $1.84–9.40/GGE, depending on feedstock source7. Comparatively, the MFSP of SAF from HTL has been reported from $2.77/GGE for sewage sludge feedstock17, $3.34/GGE for food waste18, and up to $5.42/GGE for cultivated algae19. Furthermore, 8-18% of costs were associated with the required upgrading of HTL biocrude oil, including hydrotreating and hydrocracking17,19. For feedstocks requiring deeper heteroatom removal, the addition of a hydrodenitrogenation unit only added $0.02/GGE19.

Valorization of biowaste feedstocks like food waste into renewable transportation fuels such as SAF promotes both feedstock and energy sustainability, as well as a zero-waste circular bioeconomy. Furthermore, this waste-to-energy paradigm contributes to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 7, 12, and 13. In the 2023 SDG Report, it was found that although 28.2% of electricity came from renewable energy sources, growth in clean energy for the transportation sector has been much more limited, with only 4.0% from renewable sources12. The aviation industry, like most of the transportation sector, is difficult to electrify, so HTL represents a potential solution to pivot away from fossil fuels and achieve SDG 7 Affordable and Clean Energy. Furthermore, SAF from food waste directly serves SDG 12 Responsible Consumption and Production by providing a renewable alternative to alleviate fossil fuel consumption, as well as utilizing a feedstock that helps the goal to decrease food waste and loss 50% by 203012. Lastly, SAF production and consumption improves carbon circularity, therefore working toward SDG 13 Climate Action to reduce GHG emissions and mitigate global warming12.

HTL biocrude must be upgraded to remove inorganic components and improve its fuel properties. Depending on the feedstock, different challenges and upgrading routes exist. For example, HTL feedstocks with high protein content, such as algae, typically produce nitrogenous biocrude that may require deeper heteroatom removal with more severe or multi-stage hydrotreating20,21. Lignocellulosic oil contains a significant amount of aromatics desirable for SAF, but the complex composition of lignin compounds make them recalcitrant to hydrotreating, necessitating reaction engineering and catalyst development for efficient hydrodeoxygenation22. Furthermore, HTL of high-lipid feedstocks typically produces heavier biocrude compounds due to repolymerization reactions, requiring hydrocracking during upgrading23. Common technologies used for biocrude upgrading include distillation, esterification, emulsification, hydrotreating, hydrocracking, and steam reforming15,24,25. Catalytic hydrotreating can target removal of heteroatoms, as well as improve hydrogen content and fuel quality of the biocrude, while avoiding carbon loss from decarbonylation and decarboxylation reactions20. Previous studies have explored hydrotreating biocrude from various feedstocks including lignocellulose, agricultural waste, algae, sewage sludge, waste cooking oil, and food waste. Molybdenum-based catalysts are desirable for their low cost, comparable activity to noble-metal catalysts, and effectiveness toward deoxygenation (de-O). Cobalt molybdenum catalysts have been shown to be slightly more effective for denitrogenation (de-N) compared to nickel molybdenum. For example, 99% de-N was achieved for hydrotreated HTL biocrude using CoMo26, while NiMo achieved up to 80% using single-stage hydrotreating27, and 92.5% using two-stage hydrotreating21. Additionally, Cronin et al. found that CoMo led to increased removal of heterocyclic nitrogenates, such as pyridine and pyrimidine28. Catalysts with higher metal loads exhibit improved yield and de-O29, and while organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, and 2-propanol can act as hydrogen donors, they may also cause competing reactions between hydrogenating the solvent and biocrude oil30.

Hydrotreating temperatures for HTL biocrude typically range from 350 to 400 °C and pressures of 4–10 MPa20,27,28. The use of lower temperatures (200-325 °C) has also been explored to improve biocrude stabilization for increased demetallization31,32 and de-N21. Depending on the reactor configuration (batch vs. continuous), the catalyst load and retention time (RT) may be defined individually or as a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV, h−1). In batch reactors, the equivalent WHSV can be defined as the ratio of biocrude to catalyst mass divided by the RT. For continuous hydrotreating, the 0.3–1.0 h−1 WHSV was used, with 0.5 h−1 the most common27,28,31,32. Meanwhile, batch reactors applied catalyst:oil mass ratios of 0.5 and RTs of 4 h, yielding an equivalent WHSV of 0.5 h−1, making them comparable to conditions in a continuous reactor20,21,32. Existing studies showed that temperature and pressure are significant factors for de-O and de-N, while also influencing fuel quality and product yields29,33. Although higher temperature increased oil recovery and is required for further de-N, it may also lead to polymerization, condensation, and cracking reactions due to instability of reactive oxygenates32,34. At higher hydrogen pressure, the extent of de-O increased, while coking and decarboxylation reactions were minimized and there was improved hydrogenation of heterocyclic nitrogenates20,27,30. However, at severe pressures, polymerization of small molecules may also occur, decreasing the final oil yield29. Meanwhile, low pressures may result in the diffusion of gases formed during hydrocracking reactions, causing biocrude oil to be increasingly converted into gas and lighter molecules29. The RT also influenced product yields and fuel quality, with longer times allowing for further de-O and hydrocracking reactions29,30. But at extended reaction times (>4 h), polymerization reactions occured and increased coke formation caused catalyst deactivation29,30.

Although previous works have also produced SAF candidates through the catalytic treatment of food waste-derived precursors, their resulting fuel viability was restricted by blending limits, nitrogen, and sulfur levels. For example, Cronin et al. hydrotreated biocrude from HTL of food waste using CoMo and NiMo, but 0.86–1.34 wt% nitrogen and 0.02–0.03 wt% sulfur remained28. Meanwhile, catalytic upgrading of volatile fatty acids (VFA) from the anaerobic digestion of food waste produced a neat SAF candidate, i.e., unblended, with 26–68 ppm nitrogen, slightly above the ASTM limit of 15 ppm16. Additionally, the VFA-SAF candidate was limited by its flash point and low temperature viscosity, requiring at least 70% blending with Jet A to meet ASTM specification limits in Tier α and β tests16. In this study, it was shown that cobalt molybdenum catalyst effectively upgraded food waste-derived HTL biocrude oil into drop-in SAF. Through parameter screening and optimization, a neat SAF candidate was produced that met preliminary ASTM qualifications for jet fuel properties, possessing low nitrogen and sulfur levels, thereby advancing circularity of the aviation sector.

Hydrotreating parameter screening

The products yields, elemental composition, and parameter screening results are displayed in Fig. 1. It was seen that oil yield generally decreased with combinations of higher parameter levels (Fig. 1A). This was mainly due to polymerization reactions occurring during extended RTs that increased char formation, as well as increased hydrocracking and gasification reactions at high pressure and temperature. Greater amounts of aqueous and char products were seen at the low and medium temperatures, indicating that at higher severity, less polymerization and recondensation occurs over gasification. Lack of aqueous product at higher temperatures suggested decarboxylation and decarbonylation pathways over hydrodeoxygenation, yielding gaseous products rather than water. In general, higher de-O resulted in increased higher heating values (HHV) (Fig. 1A, B). 76–100% de-O was achieved, with up to 2.21 wt% remaining oxygen in the oil. Hydrotreated oil with remaining oxygen were treated at lower temperature and RT, indicating the importance of these parameters for de-O. Desulfurization (de-S) was effective at higher severities, with up to 94% sulfur removal and 20 ppm remaining. De-N was least efficient, ranging from 7 to 23% with 0.55–0.66 wt% nitrogen remaining in the hydrotreated oil.

Improved fuel quality and heteroatom removal were obtained at the expense of carbon and energy recovery (Cr and Er), especially due to carbon losses from gasification at severe hydrotreating conditions. The most significant parameters affecting de-O, Er, and Cr were determined using Taguchi delta values, the difference between the highest and lowest mean of response (Fig. 1C). For de-O, the most significant parameters were catalyst-to-oil ratio (cat:oil) > temperature (T) > hydrogen load-to-biocrude oxygen ratio (H:O) > retention time (RT), while for Cr and Er they were T > cat:oil > RT > H:O. Though H:O was more important for oxygen removal than carbon and energy recovery, the highest average de-Os were obtained at 15:1 H:O ratios. Therefore, T, cat:oil, and RT were selected as the parameters to undergo optimization for SAF production while the H:O ratio was held constant.

Improved boiling point distribution and hydrocarbon composition was also observed across changes in hydrotreating temperature and catalyst ratio. Temperature was the most significant factor affecting the boiling point distribution of the hydrotreated biocrude oil (Fig. S1A). At lower temperatures, light fractions <250 °C increased compared to PT biocrude oil, but the amount of mid-range fractions from 250 to 350 °C decreased while the amount of heavier fuel fractions >350 °C increased. Therefore, at mild hydrotreating conditions, polymerization and coking reactions may decrease the yield of viable distillates in the transportation fuel range. Notably, at the highest temperatures, the hydrotreated biocrude oil contained >99% distillate fractions <250 °C, with H9 exhibiting extremely similar boiling point distribution to Jet-A. At the mildest conditions (H1), the amount of n-alkanes significantly increased from 19.91% in the PT biocrude oil to 84.72% after hydrotreating, indicating de-O and hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons and O-containing compounds such as fatty acids (Fig. S1B). With increased catalyst ratio (H2-3), alkenes were further hydrogenated, and small increases in aromatics and cycloalkanes were seen. At higher temperatures, isomerization and cracking reactions are favored, while n-alkanes can also undergo dehydrocyclization to form aromatics35,36. This caused the hydrocarbon distribution to further broaden and include more cycloalkanes, isoalkanes, and aromatics. At elevated temperature, higher oil yield and de-O also improved the Cr and Er of the hydrotreated HTL biocrude (Fig. S1C).

Hydrotreating parameter optimization and fuel properties

Average carbon number and hydrocarbon type are significant properties in predicting the properties of SAF37,38. Having an average carbon number closer to conventional jet fuel’s is desirable to stay within ASTM specification limits for SAF. Contour heat maps elucidated the effect of T, RT, and cat:oil on the average carbon number of hydrotreated biocrude oil (Fig. 2A–C and Table S5). It was seen that T had a greater effect than RT on average carbon number, with decreased carbon number correlated with increased hydrotreating T (Fig. 2A). The slight tilt of the contour lines toward the left also reflected decreased carbon number at longer RT, indicating breakdown of the carbon chains with limited repolymerization. Similar trends were seen for T and cat:oil, with decreased carbon number with increased T at all levels of cat:oil (Fig. 2B). Meanwhile, the change in carbon number across RT and cat:oil was less pronounced (Fig. 2C). A diagonal of slightly higher average carbon numbers was observed from high cat:oil and low RT to low cat:oil and high RT, showing that at mild combinations of cat:oil and RT, less cracking occurred. The diagonal pattern across the axis ranges was mainly attributed to the greater effect of T on average carbon number. For example, points on the contour line where average carbon number ~13, were those where different T (350 vs. 450 °C) were used at the same RT and cat:oil. Therefore, the change in T caused deviations in the average carbon number. Compared to T, RT, and cat:oil had less effect on carbon number. Overall, the average carbon number further decreased at combinations of higher T, RT, and cat:oil. Therefore, while a higher temperature was required to achieve an average carbon number closer to jet fuel, consideration should be taken in its combination with RT and cat:oil to avoid SAF products with carbon chains that are too light.

The modified Van Krevelen diagrams exhibit effective de-O and de-S during hydrotreating, but varying de-N (Fig. 2D–E). A majority of the SAF samples yielded complete oxygen and sulfur removal, with O/C and S/C molar ratios of 0. The H/C molar ratio of Jet-A and other conventional jet fuels depend on their specific composition. In this case, the obtained Jet-A sample was measured to have an H/C ratio of 1.93. Nearly all the hydrotreated HTL biocrude had H/C > 1.90 and some had H/C > 2.00, reflecting their comparable elemental composition to Jet-A, high HHV, and potential for improved combustion. A wide range of de-N was observed, indicating the importance of hydrotreating parameter tuning on nitrogen removal. Considering the cold-weld CHN method used, the variation may also be due to systematic (instrumental or measurement) errors. With a nitrogen detection limit of 0.1%, at least 87% de-N was achieved in a few cases. High de-N in a single hydrotreating step may be a result of the HTL biocrude pretreatment, where the removal of salt and ash prevents catalyst plugging and deactivation39. Furthermore, up to 40% oxygen, 55% sulfur, and 22% nitrogen could be removed during pretreatment, enabling additional stabilization of the biocrude prior to hydrotreating39. Notably, compared to a previous study that used CoMo and NiMo catalysts to hydrotreat HTL biocrude oil derived from food waste, improved de-O, de-S, and de-N was achieved in this work28. However, in comparison to reported hydrocarbon composition of approved SAFs from FT-, HEFA-, and ATJ-SPK, the H/C value from HTL still has room to improve16.

Comparing the hydrocarbon type, carbon number distribution, and boiling point distribution of HTL biocrude oil before and after hydrotreating, it was confirmed that hydrotreating at high temperature produced SAF samples with composition closest to Jet-A (Fig. 3). Hydrotreating successfully improved the hydrocarbon composition, indicated by an increase in the n-alkane content of all samples (Fig. 3A). Like the trend seen in the parameter screening tests, hydrotreating at combinations of higher temperature, RT, and catalyst load further improved the hydrocarbon type to contain increased amounts of aromatics, isoalkanes, and cycloalkanes. Notably, several of the SAF samples contained similar or higher amounts of isoalkanes and cycloalkanes compared to Jet-A, along with lower aromatic content. This could lead to improved cold flow properties and decreased contrails40. Notably, the Jet-A sample contained 35% aromatics and synthesized jet fuel must have 8-25% aromatics content. All samples hydrotreated at 450 °C (B2, B4, B6, B8) met the low level aromatics requirement of at least 8%, ranging from 9 to 13%. As seen in our SAF candidate, this value is also expected to increase after taking the jet cut from the whole hydrotreated biocrude due to the higher abundance of aromatics in the C8–C16 range. Recent work has also indicated that cycloalkanes can replace the volume swell properties of aromatics in jet fuel41.

HTL biocrude oil consistently became lighter after hydrotreating. This was reflected in the boiling point distribution, where hydrotreating increased the fraction of distillate ranges <250 °C (Fig. 3B). Like what was seen during the parameter screening, hydrotreating at the lowest parameter levels (e.g., B5) caused polymerization reactions that formed heavier compounds with boiling points above 350 °C. On the other hand, hydrotreating at higher temperatures and combinations of increased RT and cat:oil produced samples mainly composed of fractions with distillate ranges <250 °C. Specifically, all samples hydrotreated at the highest temperature level had a boiling point distribution most similar to Jet-A.

The carbon number range in Jet-A is typically C8–C16. This was confirmed in the commercial Jet-A sample tested, where 95% of its compounds were within the C8-C16 range and its average carbon number was 11.2 (Fig. 3C). Chemical compounds were also grouped into <C8, C17–C20, and >C20, to represent potential distillates in the ranges for gasoline, diesel, and heavy oils, respectively. All samples that had an average carbon number similar to or less than Jet-A (<11.5) were those produced at high temperature during hydrotreating (450 °C). However, since they still contained fractions outside the C8–C16 range, their average carbon number will likely change after distillation to obtain the SAF cut. Due to the importance of average carbon number on the chemical and handling properties of jet fuel, regression of the RSM data was used to predict the average carbon number and compare it to the experimental values (Fig. 3D). The predicted and experimental values were highly correlated, with an R2 of 0.97. A 95% confidence band and prediction band also demonstrated the ability of the model to predict new values within the experimental parameters.

SAF candidacy: Tier α tests for hydrotreated HTL biocrude oil

Based on the parameter screening and optimization, the HTL biocrude was hydrotreated to obtain a SAF candidate for Tier α prescreening of jet fuel properties that are critical for combustor operability limit. The SAF candidate achieved a carbon and energy recovery of 85.2 and 90.2%, respectively. Complete de-O and de-N was achieved, along with a final sulfur content of 10 ppm, meeting the 15 ppm maximum42. The physicochemical properties were further listed in Table S6. Compared to conventional jet fuel, the SAF candidate from this work contained higher amounts of light hydrocarbons, was within ASTM specification limits for critical bulk properties, and had a comparable distillation range predicted within specification limits (Fig. 4). The hydrocarbon compositions of both the hydrotreated HTL biocrude oil and SAF cut were mainly n-alkanes, followed by cycloalkanes, aromatics, and isoalkanes (Fig. 4A, B). Compared to the average jet fuel carbon distribution, the hydrotreated HTL biocrude oil contained high amounts of lighter (<C9) and heavier (>C13) hydrocarbons (Fig. 4A). The greater amount of heavy compounds in the whole hydrotreated HTL biocrude oil caused the average carbon number to be 12.7, slightly higher than jet fuel’s 11.4. However, after taking the SAF cut from C9 to C13, the average carbon number was more similar to jet fuel, decreasing to 10.7 (Fig. 4B). This SAF cut represented 31.5 wt% of the hydrotreated HTL biocrude oil. Meanwhile, the light and heavy ends are also potential candidates for biobased gasoline and diesel.

It was observed that the surface tension (σ), density (ρ), kinematic viscosity (ν), lower heating value (LHV), flash point, derived cetane number, and freeze point were all within ASTM specification limits (Fig. 4C). Notably, the density and freeze point of the SAF candidate were near, but still, within ASTM specification limits, which was attributed to the high amount of heavy-end n-alkanes. At the same time, LHV was even higher than conventional jet fuel, likely due to the higher concentration of n-alkanes, which have high specific energy43. Although n-alkanes have high energy content and thermal stability, light n-alkanes (<nC7) can cause flash point violations and heavy n-alkanes (>nC14) can cause freeze point violations43. Since the SAF cut contained >50% n-alkanes, the fuel likely has a high smoke point, preventing soot formation and enabling cleaner combustion. However, there were few isoalkanes present in the hydrotreated HTL biocrude oil and SAF cut. Lightly branched isoalkanes are desirable for jet fuel because they improve cold flow properties, specific energy, thermal stability, and freeze point43,44,45. Isoalkanes improve the pour point and cloud point of jet fuel, which are especially important for the operability and performance of jet fuel at high altitude and low temperature46,47. Meanwhile, the high content of cycloalkanes and aromatics (~44%) also help to improve performance and handling properties of the SAF. For instance, monocycloalkanes improve the density, freeze point, and specific energy of the fuel, while polycycloalkanes increase energy density, specific energy, and thermal stability43. Aromatics are needed to promote seal swelling in jet engines, but they have high particulate emissions and cause significant sooting during burning. Lastly, the predicted ASTM D86 distillation curve of the SAF candidate was similar to the conventional jet range (Fig. 4D). Although the light and heavy ends fell slightly below the jet range, it was still within ASTM specification limits. The final boiling point for the SAF cut was set lower than the typical range for conventional jet fuel to address concerns about the freezing point. To further mitigate the freezing point issue, an additional isomerization step could be implemented to convert linear alkanes into lightly branched alkanes. This adjustment would allow the final boiling point to be increased to the conventional jet fuel range, resulting in a higher SAF yield. This food waste-derived HTL-SAF candidate was predicted to meet key ASTM specifications without blending. However, it is noted that some parameters, such as density and freeze point, are close to the specification limits. Therefore, blending may be required if any variations in feedstock composition cause deviations in the resulting fuel properties. The mass, carbon, and energy yields for this SAF candidate (Table S7) provided implications for scale-up and future areas of direction. After HTL biocrude pretreatment, hydrotreating, and distillation to obtain the SAF cut, the final mass yield from food waste was 6.94 wt%. For instance, improved mass transfer during hydrotreating could increase the oil yield and decrease losses to char and gaseous products. As mentioned before, increased alkane branching can also help improve the hydrotreated biocrude’s final boiling point, resulting in a higher SAF yield. Therefore, continuous hydrotreating, reaction tuning, and catalyst development present potential areas of work to improve viability of the HTL-SAF route.

Circularity index

Sustainability analysis using a circularity index (CI) demonstrated improved circularity in the U.S. aviation industry when implementing a HTL-SAF pathway. CI is a single value, between 0 and 1, that measures the circularity of concern in terms of consumable, renewable, and recoverable resources48. In this case, the energy and carbon CI was determined for the entire existing U.S. aviation industry’s jet fuel consumption and potential for SAF production from disposed food waste. Average consumption and production data for petroleum products, food waste, and the HTL process was collected for eight value chain categories: extraction, refining, distribution, consumption, disposal, recovery, remake, and reuse (Tables S8 and S9). In the existing U.S. aviation industry, jet fuel is mainly derived from petroleum products, with very little SAF consumption. In the first half of 2024, an average of 1,657,000 barrels of jet fuel were consumed per day49. Meanwhile, just 15.8 million gallons of SAF were consumed in 202250. In 2019, it was estimated that 66.2 million wet tons of food waste was managed in the U.S., with 39.6 million tons going to landfills51.

After implementing the use of HTL and hydrotreating for food waste recoverable from landfills, the CIs improved significantly. Energy CI increased from 1.35 to 32.51% and carbon CI increased from 0.13% to 17.12%. Despite the improved circularity through producing SAF from food waste, it is apparent that food waste alone will only be part of the solution to provide feedstocks for SAF. Specifically, municipal solid waste and wet waste (including food waste) is just a fraction of the potential sustainable biomass supply for production of liquid transportation fuels. Other emerging biomass feedstocks, such as algae, energy crops, forestry, agricultural, vegetable oil, and starch supplies, also have potential for SAF production52. Additionally, HTL biocrude from food waste can produce other bioproducts besides SAF (such as gasoline, diesel, and biobinders), so the potential CI of the overall system could be much higher53. Thereby, while food waste alone can help increase energy and carbon CI of the aviation industry by nearly 20%, utilization of other biomass feedstocks for SAF production can fill the gap to create a fully circular bioeconomy in the aviation industry and beyond.

The pathway from food waste to SAF via HTL and hydrotreating is complicated, involving many factors and variations. To consider the uncertainty in CI under changes in pathway conditions, including amount of disposed and recoverable food waste, carbon and energy contents of food waste and SAF, and mass yields during hydrotreating and distillation, a Monte Carlo analysis with 1,000 simulations was conducted. A larger range of uncertainty was depicted for energy circularity, ranging from 28.26% to 48.73% compared to 14.05–26.93% for carbon circularity (Fig. 5A). For both CIs, higher circularity was observed at increased food waste recovery, which was reflected in its high Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (Fig. 5B). In the U.S., 59.84% of food waste is managed by landfills, with the other ~40% managed by combustion, donation, sewer/wastewater treatment, composting, biochemical processing, animal feed, anaerobic digestion, and land application51. Therefore, the production of SAF and value of CI for the aviation industry could continue to increase if food waste management beyond landfills was targeted for recovery in HTL and biorefinery processes. The carbon and energy content of the food waste also had a relatively high correlation to their respective CIs, indicating the importance of the feedstock’s biochemical composition. Overall, increased recovery of food waste from other waste management practices would most greatly improve the circularity of this HTL-SAF pathway.

HTL is a promising pathway to produce SAF. Although HTL can valorize food waste into biocrude oil, hydrotreating is still required to remove disadvantageous heteroatoms. It was determined that temperature, catalyst:oil ratio, and RT were the most impactful parameters on hydrotreating for de-O, carbon recovery, and energy recovery. These parameters were optimized to achieve high de-O and de-N, producing a SAF sample that met ASTM specification limits for several fuel properties without blending. Future work may explore parametric tuning and catalyst development to promote isomerization during hydrotreating for improved cold flow properties and higher SAF yield. Furthermore, this pathway also demonstrated improved energy and carbon circularity in the U.S. aviation sector, which could be further increased by changing food waste management practices for higher food waste recovery. In all, it was shown that HTL of food waste is a potential pathway to produce drop-in SAF for a decarbonized aviation industry.

HTL biocrude oil

Food waste from a local food processing plant in Champaign, IL was processed in a pilot-scale continuous plug flow HTL reactor at 20 wt% solids content, 300 °C and 12.4 MPa for a 20 min RT23. Prior to hydrotreating, multi-stage pretreating was performed to desalt the biocrude using a water wash at 100 °C for 60 min; dewater according to ASTM D2892 Annex X1; and deash through isolation of fraction <350 °C via distillation39. The physicochemical characterization of the food processing waste feedstock, initial (BC), and pretreated (PT) HTL biocrude oil are in Table S2.

Hydrotreating experiments

Commercial catalyst CoMo/Al2O3 (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used to hydrotreat HTL biocrude oil. First, experiments were completed in triplicate for a Taguchi design L9 orthogonal array (Table S3) to screen the significance of temperature, catalyst-to-oil ratio (cat:oil w/w), RT, and hydrogen load-to-biocrude oxygen ratio (H:O mol:mol). Then, experiments were completed in duplicate using a Box-Behnken design to optimize the parameter levels using response surface methodology (Table S4). Designated amounts of biocrude oil and catalyst were loaded into a 100 ml Series 4590 Micro Stirred Reactor (Parr Instrument Company, IL, USA). The reactor was purged to remove air, pressurized with hydrogen, then heated to desired reaction conditions with a stir rate of 350 rpm throughout the RT. After completion of the hydrotreating reaction, the reactor was quenched with water to cool. The oil and aqueous phases were collected in a pre-weighed container and separated by centrifugation. The catalyst and char products were collected separately, rinsed with DCM, and vacuum filtered. The gaseous phase was sampled in a gas bag (Sigma-Aldrich) for analysis. The reactor was rinsed with DCM to recover any residual oil, char, or catalyst. The DCM evaporated overnight at 60 °C and the final oil and char mass was recorded. The oil recovered from the solvent rinse was not analyzed. A commercial Jet-A sample was obtained from Willard Airport at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (Savoy, IL, USA).

The mass yields, carbon recovery, and energy recovery were calculated according to Eqs. 1–3, respectively.

$${m}_{x}=\frac{{m}_{x}}{{m}_{b}}\times 100\%$$

(1)

$${C}_{r}=\frac{{C}_{o}}{{C}_{b}}\times {m}_{o}\times 100\%$$

(2)

$${E}_{r}=\frac{{{HHV}}_{o}}{{{HHV}}_{b}}\times {m}_{o}\times 100\%$$

(3)

where m = mass of product, x = product type (o = oil, w = water, g = gas, c = char, b = biocrude), C = carbon content (r = recovered), Er = energy recovery, and HHV = higher heating value. Oil and aqueous products were directly measured, while char was calculated by subtracting catalyst mass from the collected solids product, and gas was calculated by difference.

Heteroatom removal (de-X) was calculated based on the elemental composition of the HTL biocrude (Eq. 4):

$${de}-X=1-\frac{{X}_{{\mathrm{final}}}}{{X}_{{\mathrm{initial}}}}$$

(4)

where X = heteroatom element (ex. oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), or sulfur (S)), Xfinal = content in the upgraded biocrude, and Xinitial = content in the initial HTL biocrude.

Analytical methods

CE440 CHN analyzer (Exeter Analytical, Coventry, UK) was used to determine the elemental composition (carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen content). Triplicate measurements were taken from each sample, where tins were cold-weld shut prior to purging to minimize loss of volatiles. Due to the presence of air in the sample, nitrogen content was recalculated based on a blank. The detection limit was 0.10% for all elements. Oxygen was determined by difference. A PerkinElmer ICP-MS (Model NexION 350D) was used to measure sulfur content. Due to sample volume limitations, this was performed once per sample. Dulong’s formula54 (Eq. 5) was used to calculate the higher heating value (HHV).

$${HHV}\,\left({{\mathrm{MJ}}}/{\mathrm{kg}}\right)=0.3516\,{{C}}+1.16225\,{{H}}-0.1109\,{{O}}+0.0628\,{{N}}$$

(5)

The weight loss curves and boiling point distribution were determined with a Q50 thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) (TA Instruments, DE, USA). 15 mg of sample was heated from 20 to 600 °C at 20 °C/min and nitrogen flow rate of 60 mL/min. The temperatures for boiling point ranges were selected based on literature55. It is important to note that thermal degradation may occur due to atmospheric conditions during TGA, making boiling points less accurate. The total acid number (TAN) was determined according to ASTM D974, in which oil sample dissolved in a solution of toluene, 2-propanol, and water was titrated with phenolphthalein indicator and 0.1 M KOH56. Chemical composition was determined via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), using a Micromass 70-VSE (Waters Corporation, MA, USA). 2 μL sample injected split mode in a ZB-5MS column. 30–80 °C at 25 °C/min and 2 min hold, then increased to 220 °C at 8 °C/min, then to 280 °C at 25 °C/min. A 70 eV electron ionization voltage was used, scanning from 30 to 800 m/z. Peaks were analyzed using MassLynx Mass Spectrometry Software according to the NIST08 Mass Spectral Database57.

The jet fuel cut (150–230 °C) of hydrotreated HTL biocrude oil from this work was characterized using Tier α tests as a precursor to ASTM D4054 evaluation. Viability of the SAF candidate was prescreened by comparing its chemical composition, distillation, and fuel properties to conventional jet fuel and ASTM D7566 specifications. Specifically, a 2D-GC method developed by the Heyne group at Washington State University was used to determine the hydrocarbon type and distribution, a distillation curve was obtained from the 2D-GC data to show ASTM D86 results, and the 2D-GC results were used to predict jet fuel properties37,38,42.

The circularity index (CI, Eq. 6) of the system was calculated according to methods previously described48:

$${CI}=\frac{{Y}_{R}}{Y}=\frac{{\sum }_{{{\rm{i}}}=1}^{{{\rm{n}}}}{R}_{i}{X}_{i}+\left[{a}_{{ij}}\right]\left[{X}_{i}\right]}{{\sum }_{{{\rm{i}}}=1}^{{{\rm{n}}}}\left({C}_{i}+{R}_{i}\right){X}_{i}}$$

(6)

where YR is the total renewable and recovered resources in a circular system, Y is the total output of the system, Ri is the fraction from renewable resources, Xi is the content of the ith category, aij is the fraction from recoverable resources, and Ci is the fraction from consumable resources. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the CI was done using Monte Carlo analysis with 1000 simulations. The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was used to rank the correlation of each parameter between the CIs. Further explanations of the CI method, uncertainty, and sensitivity methods are in the Supplementary Information.

Data analysis was conducted in Excel (Version 2507) and OriginPro 2025 (Version 10.2 SR1).

SAF is essentially lab-grown jet fuel, made from carbon already in the environment, rather than pumped up from oil wells.
It will account for just 0.7% of all jet fuel in 2025, according to the International Air Transport Association.
In 2010, LanzaTech and the U.S. Department of Energy started collaborating on technology to transform ethanol into jet fuel.
“You’re not getting a ton of greenhouse gas savings relative to just using [traditional] jet fuel,” he says.","A first-of-its-kind refinery has been in the works for a decade and half. Set to be completed this year, the facility is design to produce climate-friendly jet fuel, a material in increasing demand in response to climate commitments and regulations around the world. The refinery—called the Freedom Pines Fuels—was designed to showcase new methods of producing the fuel, and was receiving government support to help clean up air travel.

Now, a year behind schedule due to a hurricane and equipment glitches, the project hit another roadblock this summer, when a major shift in U.S. energy policy under the new administration threw a wrench into the business model. It’s now a story of a company quickly adapting under pressure, and an illustration of the challenges—and continued opportunity—of clean energy in a more hostile political environment.

The goal of the company behind the project, Illinois-based LanzaJet, is to produce a close facsimile of the kerosene-based fuel that powers jets and many helicopters and propeller planes today—without using petroleum. Instead, the Freedom Pines Fuels plant in the forest hamlet of Soperton, Georgia, will use ethanol to make what’s known as sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. LanzaJet was ready to start with ethanol made from Brazilian sugarcane, until a new U.S. law forced a quick shift to midwestern corn.

The fuels that make modern travel possible—kerosene, gasoline, and diesel—are typically refined from crude oil, rich in hydrocarbon molecules that release copious energy when burned. But burning them also inundates the atmosphere with heat-trapping carbon dioxide.

SAF is essentially lab-grown jet fuel, made from carbon already in the environment, rather than pumped up from oil wells. It’s a tweaked formulation—for instance, with less sulfur—designed to burn cleaner. Sugarcane and corn are two of many possible carbon sources, along with cornstalks, twigs, vegetable oil, factory exhaust, and even garbage. The CO2 released by making and burning SAF should, in theory, be offset by the carbon captured to make more SAF, forming a closed loop.

The Freedom Pines Fuels plant is a mini version of a typical refinery, slated to produce nine million gallons of SAF and a million of green diesel fuel in its first year. (A standard crude-oil refinery could churn a billion or more gallons of fuels.)

But the Georgia plant is meant to be big enough to show the technology can work at scale. “Most process technology companies . . . almost never build plants of this magnitude,” says Jimmy Samartzis, a climate-focused airline industry veteran who became CEO when LanzaJet was founded in 2020. “It’s expensive, it’s big. But we thought and felt—accurately, looking back on it today—it was the right move to make.” Before the 2024 election, the federal government was also promising generous financial support for Freedom Pines.

A Potential Market Boom

LanzaJet is backed by companies that are counting on, or stand to benefit from, the shift to carbon-neutral jet fuel, including All Nippon Airways, British Airways, Southwest Airlines, and plane maker Airbus.

The UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has committed the industry to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. In addition, laws and regulations, such as in Singapore, the U.K., and the European Union, have started requiring airlines or suppliers to blend SAF into the jet fuel supply, beginning at around 1–2%, then ramping up in later years. More such requirements are in the works in India, Indonesia, and Japan. The European Union is by far the most ambitious. From a mere 2% SAF blend required today, quotas rise steeply about every five years, hitting 70% in 2050.

There’s further demand from companies, such as LanzaJet backer Microsoft, striving to meet aggressive greenhouse gas reduction goals. In addition to reducing its own footprint, Microsoft has announced plans to buy “SAF Certificates,” which subsidize the cost of the fuel to boost its usage. SAF has a long way to go in making a dent. It will account for just 0.7% of all jet fuel in 2025, according to the International Air Transport Association.

“Obviously, if you look at the size of the overall aviation fuel space, in theory the [SAF] market is potentially huge for those that can offer a product at a competitive price,” says John MacDonagh, senior research analyst at capital markets research firm PitchBook.

LanzaJet has raised “approximately” $400 million, according to Samartzis, from these companies and other backers, including energy producers Shell and Suncor, the U.S. Department of Energy, airport operator Groupe ADP, and Bill Gates’s Breakthrough Energy fund.

Another backer is LanzaTech. Founded in Auckland, New Zealand, in 2005, it relocated its headquarters to Skokie, Illinois, in 2014. The company has engineered microbes to convert waste such as carbon monoxide and dioxide from factories into ethanol, as another route to carbon-neutral fuel and other chemicals. In 2010, LanzaTech and the U.S. Department of Energy started collaborating on technology to transform ethanol into jet fuel. In 2020, LanzaTech spun out LanzaJet as a new company to continue the work.

LanzaJet is dipping a toe into the SAF market with Freedom Pines, with plans to build more plants, such as a collaboration with British Airways to open a facility in the U.K. by 2028. LanzaJet has also announced partnerships in India, Japan, and Kazakhstan to build additional facilities. But as it continues to announce expansion overseas, things have gotten messy back at home.

SAF Meets MAGA

The U.S. has no SAF requirements for aviation companies. Instead, the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act introduced tax credits to subsidize fledgling SAF operations to scale up production and bring down prices. (Various estimates put SAF from two to five times as expensive as traditional jet fuel.) While the Republican One Big Beautiful Bill Act didn’t scrap SAF incentives completely, as it did for many other clean technologies, it did complicate LanzaJet’s plans just as it was completing the Freedom Pines plant.

LanzaJet had obtained EPA approval to use traditional ethanol to make its fuel. The company was focused on Brazilian sugarcane, which Samartzis says would cut CO2 emissions by more than the 50% threshold to qualify for credits under the Inflation Reduction Act. The new Republican legislation cut maximum subsidies from $1.75 to $1 per gallon—and limited them to fuels made with resources from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.

So LanzaJet has shifted focus to ethanol made from U.S. corn, which is more carbon intensive, for a number of reasons, says Samartzis. Sugarcane tends to have higher yields per acre, with less fertilizer, according to LanzJet, and of course it provides sugar that can be fermented directly into ethanol. Corn provides starch that first has to be converted to sugar, which takes energy. Brazilian ethanol producers also make use of crop leftovers, burning them to provide energy for their operations. U.S. producers often use natural gas or even coal.

Given all that, using corn won’t cut overall greenhouse gas emissions anywhere near the 50% target, without longer-term changes such as more sustainable farming practices and capturing the carbon released in making the ethanol, he says.

Despite all these challenges, Samartzis says that Freedom Pines will start churning out fuel soon. “Yeah, I’ve faltered in the past, right?”, he says with a chuckle. “But my expectation is that it’s certainly this year . . . How soon? I don’t want to speculate on that at this point.”

Meanwhile, LanzaJet has to compete with an established technology, called HEFA, that is already making jet fuel from fats such as used cooking oil. “Most [SAF demand] right now can be met, or all of it initially can be met, with the HEFA fuels that are less costly to produce,” says Andy Navarrete, coauthor of a recent study on sustainable aviation fuel by the International Council on Clean Transportation.

A New Starting Point

However, HEFA can’t scale up for the boom in demand coming in the next decades, he says, without turning to environmentally destructive options like clearing land for palm oil plantations. Navarrete is also circumspect about corn ethanol. “You’re not getting a ton of greenhouse gas savings relative to just using [traditional] jet fuel,” he says.

“And then there’s this bigger question of food versus fuel. And how sustainable is it, in general, to be using farmland to produce a fuel?”

Samartzis cites USDA estimates of U.S. ethanol supplies exceeding domestic demand and frames SAF as a new market for American farmers. But beyond corn and sugarcane, there can be bigger climate benefits in making ethanol from the cellulose in agricultural leftovers—like corn stalks, leaves, husks, and cobs—that might otherwise release CO2 when they rot.

This approach was always part of LanzaJet’s strategy, and it had already submitted its plan to the EPA for approval. (The U.K. plant is meant to begin operations with this “cellulosic” ethanol when it opens in 2028.) But U.S. politics are creating another roadblock. “All of these things take time, and with the government shutdown on top of it, rest assured, those processes are not moving forward right now,” says Samartzis.

Navarrete is skeptical, noting that makers of green auto fuels also foresaw a progression to using cellulose from agricultural waste. “It relied on a completely different set of technologies . . . that never quite got figured out,” he says. “[Starting with] conventional ethanol wasn’t really a useful bridge forward.”

Technology has progressed since then, with new incentives to fill the growing SAF market. Samartzis remains optimistic about a transition for the longer term. “Maybe it’s a 10 or 20% improvement rather than a 50 or 60 or 70% improvement,” he says of initial CO2 reductions using corn ethanol. “We can start to capture the improvement and then continue to invest in the changes that are required to further improve that carbon [reduction] intensity.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2025/10/p-1-91427868-headline-green-jet-fuel-maker-lanzajet-reroutes-for-the-trump-era.jpg",N,,2025-10-30 06:00:57.187689

SAFCo will help Singapore meet its goal for sustainable fuel to account for 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, rising to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030, CAAS said in a statement.

Director-general of CAAS Han Kok Juan, who will chair SAFCo, told journalists at a media conference that the company will bring together stakeholders such as airlines, fuel producers and carbon market platforms to “get them organised”, which could indirectly lower fuel costs.

“If we have an aggregated and a more efficient way of procuring sustainable aviation fuel, we are able to send a stronger demand signal to producers,” he said.

“That would hopefully stimulate investments and production, and therefore have a dampening effect on prices.”

Last year, CAAS estimated that sustainable aviation fuel costs around three to five times more than conventional jet fuel.

Former global head of marketing and sustainability at Shell Low Carbon Solutions, Ms Tan Seow Hui, has been appointed SAFCo’s chief executive officer.

Responding to a question about how SAFCo’s approach differs from current procurement practices, she said the company allows for purchasing at a greater scale.

“(SAFCo) will give us a certain scale in terms of the ability to anchor longer term and bigger contracts, give us the ability to negotiate for more competitive prices versus any individual airline or companies are able to do so,” she said.

PROCUREMENT AND FUNDING MODEL

Mr Han said procurement, targeted to begin in 2026, will be carried out through a “transparent, competitive tender process” involving suppliers that meet international sustainability standards.

SAFCo has begun engaging businesses and airlines interested in the procurement mechanism, with discussions ongoing.

In its first year, the company plans to hire about 10 staff members, with headcount to be “gauged and sized accordingly thereafter”. It is also in the process of looking for office premises. Initial startup costs will be fully funded by CAAS.

The establishment of SAFCo follows the recent passage of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (Amendment) Bill, which empowers CAAS to collect a sustainable aviation fuel levy and appoint a central procurement entity.

TARGET NOT A MANDATE

Mr Han emphasised that the 1 per cent target is not a mandate, and that the actual proportion could be higher or lower depending on market prices.

He said SAFCo will adopt a “fixed cost envelope approach”, meaning it will spend a predetermined amount on sustainable aviation fuel regardless of prevailing prices.

“If tomorrow, the price of coffee increases, I will still spend S$2. What it means is that I don’t drink a full cup, I drink a bit less than a full cup.”

Similarly, while the target is 1 per cent, the actual proportion will depend on sustainable aviation fuel prices at the time of procurement.

“This is very different from a system where ‘I want to buy a cup of coffee regardless of what the price of coffee is’,” Mr Han said, adding that the approach is designed to manage volatility.

“The market is still very nascent, the price is volatile … we want to be able to cap our exposure for the entire aviation ecosystem.”","https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--H8i01_Ql--/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2025/10/30/llt_7947_2.jpg?itok=8MNBFRaX",N,,2025-10-30 05:00:51.858456

The non-profit company will be wholly owned by CAAS, with Tan Seow Hui – who previously worked on low-carbon solutions at Shell – as chief executive. CAAS director-general Han Kok Juan will be on its board.

The central procurement of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by SAFCo will give airlines operating to and from Singapore the ability to negotiate as an aggregate, instead of as individual companies, said CAAS. This will help the company secure a more stable quantity and price amid “relatively volatile” prices.

SAFCo will supply the fuel to Changi and Seletar airports and will “support the implementation of Singapore’s national SAF policy”, CAAS said on Thursday (Oct 30).

Such central procurement is novel in aviation, and CAAS said it has shared the concept with the International Civil Aviation Organization.

SAFCo’s initial costs will be fully funded by CAAS and its office premises are currently being identified.

CAAS pointed out that its “fixed cost envelope” approach means that only funds collected by the mandatory levy on sustainable aviation fuel will be used to procure the fuel. Therefore, the quantity of fuel purchased can vary depending on the price at the time of purchase.

The sustainable aviation fuel levy must be paid to CAAS for all outbound passenger and cargo flights per passenger based on distance. In 2024, CAAS gave some examples: A direct economy-class flight from Singapore would be S$3 to Bangkok, S$6 to Tokyo and S$16 to London. The fees will be higher for more premium seat classes.

CAAS will collect the levy from air transport users, including airlines, business and general aviation users, before disbursing the monies to SAFCo.

The company will then aggregate the mandatory and voluntary demand, based on a sustainable aviation fuel registry, through a “transparent” and “competitive” tender process involving both local and foreign suppliers. The fuel will then be delivered to customers at Changi and Seletar airports.

“With predictable cash flows from the SAF levy, SAFCo can sign longer and larger contracts with SAF suppliers, providing demand certainty in a still-nascent SAF market,” said CAAS.

With the aim to build an integrated demand market for such fuel, CAAS said SAFCo will be reaching out to airlines and businesses to encourage partnerships with the company. More details are expected at the Singapore Airshow in February 2026.

Han said: “Through SAFCo, we want to get the best value for the SAF levy collected and activate a SAF ecosystem which will help advance sustainable aviation and create new economic opportunities for Singapore and beyond.”

He said there was “very, very strong interest” from airlines and businesses around voluntary sustainable aviation fuel purchases, but declined to comment on individual names.

Singapore aims to have sustainable fuel comprise 1 per cent of all the fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026. The target will rise to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.

Sustainable aviation fuel is created from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, fat waste and non-food crops. This is unlike conventional aviation fuel, which is made from fossil fuels.

CAAS said SAFCo’s immediate focus will be on establishing robust governance and procurement frameworks, as well as setting up levy collection systems and process to build manpower and procurement capability.

The Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo) will use a levy collected from passengers to buy the green jet fuel, which will be blended with traditional aviation fuel and used to refuel planes at Changi and Seletar airports.

This comes about two weeks after

Parliament passed a Bill

allowing Singapore to collect a fixed levy on all departing flights to support the use of sustainable aviation fuel by airlines.

The target is for such fuel to constitute 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, with the goal raised to 3 per cent to 5 per cent by 2030. Sustainable aviation fuel is mostly made from waste materials, such as used cooking oil.

Travellers flying out of Singapore will pay a sustainable aviation fuel levy from 2026, which SAFCo will use to buy the fuel needed to meet the target.

CAAS wholly owns SAFCo, with the authority’s director-general Han Kok Juan chairing SAFCo’s board.

Ms Tan Seow Hui, a veteran in the energy and aviation industries, has been appointed chief executive of SAFCo.

Early CAAS estimates suggested that economy-class passengers may incur a $3 levy for short-haul flights, $6 for medium-haul flights and $16 for long-haul flights. Short-haul flights include routes to places such as Bangkok, medium haul to destinations like Tokyo, and long haul to cities such as London.

More details about the levy, including the confirmed amounts, will be announced by end-2025, CAAS said.

Sustainable aviation fuel has been deemed the most practical way to decarbonise the aviation industry, as it can be blended with jet fuel and used on existing aircraft and refuelling infrastructure without costly modifications.

At a press conference on Oct 30, Mr Han and Ms Tan said SAFCo will centrally procure the fuel based on the levy collected. The money will be collected into a central pool, which SAFCo will use to buy the fuel.

Ms Tan said SAFCo’s immediate priorities are to establish strong governance and procurement frameworks, set up levy collection systems and processes and build its team and procurement capability.

It will have a team of 10 in its first year.

The company will also engage parties such as airlines and cargo operators ahead of the first procurement round in 2026, she said.

Beyond using the levy to buy the fuel, the company will also pool voluntary demand from organisations that seek to purchase sustainable jet fuel to reduce their corporate air travel or supply chain carbon footprint, Mr Han added.

Aggregating demand for the fuel and centralising procurement will help the company to secure longer-term contracts and allow it to negotiate more competitive prices, compared with individual buyers, Ms Tan noted.

The cost of sustainable aviation fuel is among the major barriers that have limited its widespread adoption. Green jet fuel costs about three to four times more than traditional jet fuel.

This manner of procurement will send a stronger demand signal to producers of sustainable jet fuel, Mr Han said. “That will, hopefully, stimulate sustainable aviation fuel investments and production, and… have a dampening effect on prices.”

He said the procurement of sustainable aviation fuel would be done through a transparent, competitive tender process that meets international sustainability standards.

Green jet fuel prices are relatively volatile because of supply and demand conditions, which is why Singapore has adopted a fixed levy approach, Mr Han said. A fixed levy amount will allow SAFCo to estimate how much sustainable aviation fuel it can afford to buy, given fluctuating prices.

This method will allow “certainty and stability, and we actually cap the cost of sustainable aviation fuel adoption for the entire aviation ecosystem”, Mr Han noted.

SAFCo will “help to encourage sustainable aviation fuel production through clear demand signals, while ensuring that costs remain contained, predictable and fairly shared,” he added.

“(This will) allow us to meet our environmental responsibilities, while safeguarding the competitiveness of our air hub.”

CAAS chief sustainability officer Daniel Ng had said earlier in October that if market conditions are not ideal, the

1 per cent target in 2026 may not be met

, which the authorities are prepared for.

“Our approach is one where we pay what we can afford. We are not planning to be sustainable at all cost because the sustainable aviation fuel market is still very small. The price fluctuations are quite dramatic sometimes,” he noted.

Under Singapore’s sustainable air hub blueprint, launched in February 2024, Singapore will work with the aviation industry to reduce domestic aviation emissions from airport operations by 20 per cent from 2019 levels in 2030 and achieve net-zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/504ab20a411f6b33148f76654cc43b2a9dccb82402c5be32d04ec08585288bb6,N,,2025-10-30 05:01:04.386891

The fund was established in 2020 as part of Microsoft's wider sustainability initiative to become a carbon-negative, water-positive and zero-waste company by 2030.

The US$1 billion CIF was created to accelerate the development and use of new climate technologies through both equity and debt capital.

In its five-year progress report, Microsoft stated its core belief that its business thrives when the world thrives.

When launching the fund, Microsoft had to support innovations that were not yet fully developed.

Melanie Nakagawa, Microsoft Chief Sustainability Officer, explained the necessity of this approach, saying: “Big goals need bold bets. When we launched Microsoft’s US$1bn Climate Innovation Fund in 2020, we knew the road to reaching our ambitious sustainability goals would need to be paved in part with new and innovative solutions. We needed to invest in technologies that weren't yet at commercial scale or in some cases didn’t yet exist.”

Catalytic capital and market growth

The initial hope was that these early-stage investments would generate wider interest and build momentum for scaling necessary climate solutions. According to Melanie, this is now becoming a reality.

“We’ve allocated more than US$800 million to date across 67 portfolio investors. On average, every dollar we’ve invested has attracted 15 more catalysing billions in follow-on funding. This kind of multiplier effect is helping move markets and scale innovation,” she says.

Melanie adds: “From carbon removal and recycling innovation to low-carbon building materials and sustainable aviation fuel, we’re helping turn bold ideas into tangible solutions.”

The report identifies five key conclusions that guide its ongoing strategy. These include pushing the frontiers of technology, bridging the gap to mainstream capital, delivering catalytic impact and partnering to amplify its efforts.

One example of the fund's impact is its investment in Twelve, a company using electrochemical technology to convert captured CO2 and water into synthetic fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

CIF’s investment supported the expansion of Twelve's facility in Moses Lake, Washington and resulted in a SAF offtake agreement for Microsoft.

This partnership with Alaska Airlines introduced a book-and-claim model for SAF procurement, enabling Microsoft to report lower emissions from its business travel without needing direct physical delivery of the fuel.

Following this initial support, Twelve secured an additional US$645 million in follow-on funding.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/6083205b43c0a133519ed8887b4ac715:c6d45ffc2ca0875e041aff32fc28a185/melanie-nakagawa-cso-at-microsoft-speaking-at-websummit-2023.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 05:01:09.014977

Saidrasul Ashrafkhanov, Carbon Tracker analyst and lead report author, said: “Beyond high costs, hesitant offtakers, and financing barriers, many alternative jet fuels also carry environmental downsides.
This presents a clearer near-term investment opportunity while preserving scarce sustainable AJF for long-haul flights.
Treating it as the main avenue for emission reductions risks misallocating capital and consuming finite feedstocks without significantly reducing fossil jet fuel use this decade.","A new report from Carbon Tracker, Fuel Disclosure, warns that alternative jet fuels (AJF), commonly referred to as sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), are unlikely to significantly reduce aviation emissions before 2030. Even if all current, under-development, and announced projects operate at full capacity, AJF production would cover only about 5% of global jet fuel demand and less than half of the projected growth in total consumption.

The analysis highlights that high costs, limited sustainable feedstocks, and weak bankability will constrain AJF’s impact in the coming decade.

Seven Barriers to Scaling AJF

Carbon Tracker identifies seven structural hurdles limiting the scale-up of AJF. The first four apply to all types of alternative jet fuels, while the last three specifically affect truly sustainable options:

Costs and price premiums – AJF is more expensive than fossil jet fuel, reducing demand and slowing adoption.

Regulatory uncertainty – Fragmented rules across jurisdictions hinder market growth.

Lack of long-term offtake commitments – Limited long-term agreements reduce revenue visibility for producers.

Weak bankability – Technology, feedstock, and policy risks make financing new AJF projects difficult.

Feedstock availability – Sustainable wastes and residues are scarce and challenging to collect.

Feedstock sustainability – Lifecycle emissions, land-use impacts, and biodiversity concerns restrict eligible supply.

Opportunity costs – Scarce sustainable feedstocks might achieve greater emission reductions in other sectors where mitigation is faster or cheaper.

Saidrasul Ashrafkhanov, Carbon Tracker analyst and lead report author, said:

“Beyond high costs, hesitant offtakers, and financing barriers, many alternative jet fuels also carry environmental downsides. While AJF could play a larger role in decarbonising aviation in the future, the industry must demonstrate a pathway to fuels that are truly sustainable, abundant, and feasible.”

The Need for Policy Coherence

Despite numerous support schemes, investors and environmental outcomes are not seeing clear results. Rich Collett-White, Carbon Tracker energy analyst and co-author, explained:

“A confusing mix of policies aimed at scaling alternative jet fuels, with differing definitions and eligibility rules across regions, is creating uncertainty. Consistent regulations are essential to prioritise fuels with strong environmental integrity and avoid unintended consequences.”

Short-Haul Offers Faster Gains

Significant emission reductions may be achievable sooner on short-haul routes. Nearly half of all flights cover less than 270 nautical miles (500 km). Battery-electric and hybrid-electric aircraft carrying 5–100 passengers are nearing entry into service, offering a direct route to zero-emission operations on regional legs. Hydrogen-electric aircraft could extend medium-haul operations from the mid-2030s.

This presents a clearer near-term investment opportunity while preserving scarce sustainable AJF for long-haul flights. However, funding for new-propulsion aircraft remains low compared with AJF investments.

Right-Sizing AJF’s Role

AJF will remain important for long-haul decarbonisation, where batteries cannot match the range or payload of conventional aircraft, but its role is smaller than often assumed. Carbon Tracker recommends a pragmatic, portfolio-based approach:

Manage AJF expectations – Focus on pathways with strong sustainability credentials and predictable costs, avoiding options with poor lifecycle performance or food-security risks.

Support zero-emission short-haul – Invest in battery-electric, hydrogen-electric, and hybrid-electric aircraft for sub-500 km routes, where readiness is advancing fastest.

Design smarter policy and finance – Strengthen sustainability criteria, implement revenue-certainty mechanisms, and reward genuine emissions reductions.

Bottom Line

AJF is part of the solution but not the silver bullet. Treating it as the main avenue for emission reductions risks misallocating capital and consuming finite feedstocks without significantly reducing fossil jet fuel use this decade. A balanced strategy—accelerating zero-emission aircraft on short-haul routes, conserving sustainable AJF for long-haul, and aligning policy with climate goals—offers a faster, more cost-effective, and credible path to decarbonising aviation.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-2.png,N,,2025-10-30 05:01:15.625583

This follows the launch of Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo), a government-owned non-profit company that will oversee the acquisition and distribution of SAF, as well as implementation of the country’s SAF policies.

To fund the procurement of SAF, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will also be implementing a SAF levy on all departing travellers from 2026. The levy, first announced in 2024, will also cover cargo flights, as well as business and general aviation passengers.

CAAS says details of the levy – including its quantum and roll-out date – will be announced later. It is expected the levy will be rolled out first before SAFCo begins procuring SAF.

The agency gave examples in 2024 on how much the levy could cost: an economy-class passenger flying to Bangkok could pay S$3 ($2.31), while those flying to London could pay S$16.

The funds collected will be managed by CAAS, then disbursed to SAFCo, which will source the SAF “through a transparent competitive tender process…that meet international sustainability standards like CORSIA”.

CAAS director general Han Kok Juan, who speaking at a briefing on 30 October, says the “centralised pool” of funds means there is “predictable cash flow”, which allows SAFCo to “go into longer-term competitive price agreements to secure a more stable and more affordable SAF supply”.

On top of the mandatory levy, SAFCo will also roll out a scalable voluntary demand programme” for SAF and SAF Environmental Attributes. These will involve businesses and airlines looking to voluntarily purchase SAF, and CAAS confirms it is already in talks with a few businesses on the voluntary programme.

CAAS’ Han says Singapore supports SAF adoption through a “pragmatic and balanced approach calibrated to our own circumstances”.

For instance, the procurement of SAF will be done with a fixed-cost envelopment model, where the SAF levy – and the central funds – will be a fixed rate regardless of the price of SAF.

Adds Han: “It helps to encourage self-production, to send clear demand signals while ensuring that costs remain contained, predictable and fairly shared. This, in turn, allows us to meet our environmental responsibilities while safeguarding the competitiveness of our air hub.”",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/5/5/8/113558_sustainablemaviationmfuelmmtunkermtruckmatmairport_414465.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 05:01:21.672123

Artificial intelligence (AI) Automation and digital aviation will also play a crucial role in modern airports and the future of aviation.","The aviation sector is a driving force in the current globalised society. Every day, airports see hundreds of flights, and the European airspace is busier than ever. According to aviation professionals and stakeholders, the industry must innovate quickly, not only in its sustainable practices but also in terms of digitising airport processes and streamlining the passenger experience.

Tourism growth

“The summer of 2025 saw an average of 35,000 flights per day across the European network, which is one per cent higher than the pre-pandemic levels of 2019,” highlighted Tânia Cardoso Simões, Director Aviation Transformation at EUROCONTROL, during the Global Tourism Forum (GTF) that took place in Brussels last 20-21 October.

Simões noted that, according to EUROCONTROL’’s latest report, the European airspace is expected to handle around 11 million flights by the end of 2025. The figure is projected to rise further in 2026, reaching approximately 11.4 million flights. By 2031, Eurocontrol anticipates around 12.4 million flights across the continent.

Moreover, according to Eurostat, overnight stays in EU tourist accommodation reached 1,279 million in the first half of 2025, marking a 2.3 per cent rise from the 1,249 million recorded during the same period in 2024. Foreign visitors accounted for almost half of the overnight stays, with Malta, Cyprus, and Croatia recording the highest overnight stays.

Airport infrastructure and hospitality

To handle the growing number of passengers and tourists and the pressure on aviation staff, the industry needs transformative changes. One way to do this, according to Paul Griffiths, CEO of Dubai Airports, is to “merge check-in, immigration, and security into one seamless process.” This would not only improve airport capacity, said Griffiths, but also improve passenger purchasing. “If you have gone through the check-in a few minutes, then you are going to be far more predisposed to spend money,” Griffiths noted with humour. Such a move would help airports achieve better financial sustainability.

Besides airport infrastructure, hospitality also has to improve in order to provide travellers with a better customer experience. Regardless of the technological advancements of the 21st century, human interaction and experience are what make a difference for regular flyers. “If people are trained properly, we can be a genuine hospitality experience,” remarked Griffiths. “We need to communicate with travellers on an individual basis and to make absolutely sure we are reassuring them.”

Sustainability Aviation Fuel

With thousands of daily flights, cutting emissions is one of aviation’s top priorities, making the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). SAF, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), is a fuel used in commercial aviation that reduces carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent. It can be produced from various sources such as waste oil and fats, green and municipal waste, and non-food crops.

Both Griffiths and Simões agree that this is something that should change in the current aviation operations. “We have to incentivise production. Our idea is by 2032 to have sustainable fuel to represent a significant share of aviation’s fuel,” Griffiths explained.

To support SAF development and deployment, in July 2025, the aviation industry, represented by DESTINATION 2050 partners, fuel suppliers, and cargo and express delivery operators released a call for accelerated policy that would help de-risk investment, bridge the cost gap between conventional and sustainable fuel, and create the regulatory and financial conditions needed to scale up the production and deployment of SAF.

Simões not only highlighted the importance of SAF but also added other important components of sustainable flights. She noted that hydrogen combustion and electric batteries can also be utilised for standardising more sustainable aviation operations. Hydrogen combustion in this context works like jet fuel – it is burned to generate thrust.

Hydrogen-powered airplane would emit only water vapour instead of carbon dioxide, but storing hydrogen requires cryogenic tanks capable of maintaining temperatures as low as –253 °C, since hydrogen must remain in a liquid state at such extremes. The tanks require significant space, which would mean the aircraft would have to be redesigned.

Despite these difficulties, Airbus has made publicly available its designs for an electric, hydrogen-powered airplane. Airbus initially indicated that the aircraft was scheduled for its first flight in 2035, but according to new data, this won’t happen until later in the decade.

In the future, airports also need to become greener and energy self-sufficient. Soon, Griffiths pointed out, “every single surface of Dubai Airports will be covered with solar panels.” In this way, airports would be able to produce the necessary energy they need to operate independently.

Artificial intelligence (AI)

Automation and digital aviation will also play a crucial role in modern airports and the future of aviation. Currently, in the United Arab Emirates, AI is used when an aircraft arrives at an airport gate, according to Frederico Fernandes, CEO of WIZE. Fernandes explained that the technology monitors the different teams working around the plane – refuelling, baggage, maintenance, security, and boarding. He also added that AI identifies what is happening and helps the operations centre manage everything in real time.

Moreover, AI has also been deployed for luggage monitoring, which decreased the number of mishandled luggage in 2024. Another use of the model was piloted in the UK, where London Heathrow Airport tested an AI air traffic system. This aims to support air traffic controllers, while they remain “at the heart of the operation.”

While AI could be used to optimise many processes in the industry, many are still worried about AI taking over human operations. “One of the most important questions I get is whether AI is going to be a pilot. And the answer is simple: absolutely not,” he highlighted.

He explained that rather than replacing pilots, AI can complement them. According to Fernandes, his company is the first in the world to offer students pilot training through an AI-based platform. But he explained that he is also aware that people cannot let a “delusional” AI make decisions.

What might the sky of tomorrow look like?

“The future seems bright”, for Tânia Cardoso Simões, from EUROCONTROL. She envisions a “sky where aircraft fly silently, operating with clean energy, as well as airports that generate more power than they consume and flights that waste neither fuel nor time.”",https://traveltomorrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/global-tourism-forum_.jpg#159865,N,,2025-10-30 05:01:26.061660

""In this moment, we'll be judged by our actions – not our words. And at United Airlines, progress is everything.

""Last week marked a milestone for advancing sustainable aviation fuel: for the first time ever, SAF is now flowing to three new airports – Newark, Dulles and Houston.""

The fuel supplier began deliveries to Houston in July and will continue until the end of October 2025. Deliveries to Newark and Dulles started in September and are scheduled to run until the end of 2025.

Policy incentives remain crucial

The deployment relies on existing pipeline infrastructure from Neste's SAF terminal facilities in Houston, where neat Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel is blended with conventional jet fuel to meet aviation specifications.

Aviation accounts for a relatively small share of global emissions but is one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonise, with technological innovation needed across production of low-emission fuels, improvements in aircraft and engines and operational optimisation.

Lauren has acknowledged that her sector is dependence on government support when it comes to decarbonisation.

""While United remains the leading SAF user in the U.S., using over 4,300 metric tons (13 million gallons) last year, we recognize that the growth of the SAF market requires support from both state and federal governments,"" she explains.

""This didn't happen easily or overnight. It took relentless coordination, innovation, and a team that refused to settle for 'good enough.' But we did it — because meaningful change demands action.""

Scale and production challenges

Carl Nyberg, Senior Vice President of Commercial Renewable Products at Neste, stresses the need for supportive policies in the push for sustainable aviation.

The Growing Need for Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Waste to Energy Solutions

The aviation industry faces mounting pressure to reduce its carbon footprint. Sustainable aviation fuel represents a critical pathway toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Unlike conventional jet fuel derived from fossil fuels, SAF production utilizes renewable resources to create cleaner alternatives.

The concept of waste to energy has gained significant traction across industries. Agricultural operations, particularly dairy farms, generate enormous amounts of organic waste that traditionally poses disposal challenges. However, this waste contains valuable energy potential in the form of biogas.

Dairy farm biogas emerges from the natural decomposition of manure in waste lagoons. This biogas consists primarily of methane and carbon dioxide—components that can be captured and converted into useful energy products. The challenge has always been developing cost-effective technology to harness this potential.

Traditional SAF production methods often require extensive infrastructure investments and complex supply chains. These barriers have limited widespread adoption, particularly among smaller agricultural operations. The need for innovative technologies that can operate at the farm level has become increasingly apparent.

Renewable fuel production from agricultural waste represents a perfect example of Circular Economy principles. Instead of viewing manure as a waste product requiring disposal, this approach transforms it into a valuable commodity that supports both environmental goals and economic development.

Revolutionary Ouro Reactor Technology for Electric Reforming

Circularity Fuels’ Ouro reactor represents a technological breakthrough in biogas to jet fuel conversion. This compact, electric-powered system can convert raw biogas directly into synthesis gas without requiring combustion or expensive pre-treatment processes.

The Ouro reactor addresses key limitations of conventional reforming systems. Traditional methods require extensive purification of biogas before conversion, adding significant costs and complexity. The electric reforming system operates differently by processing unrefined biogas directly from farm waste lagoons.

This innovative approach eliminates the need for pipeline infrastructure. Farmers can produce synthesis gas on-site and transport it via existing trucking networks. This flexibility removes a major barrier that has prevented many agricultural operations from participating in renewable fuel production.

The Ouro reactor is the first system to electrically convert raw biogas from farm waste lagoons into jet fuel components without combustion, eliminating pre-treatment requirements. This technological advancement enables stable operation despite contaminants that would damage conventional reformers.

The economic impact is substantial. The technology achieves a 100x cost reduction compared to conventional synthesis gas production systems. This dramatic cost improvement makes waste to energy conversion financially viable for farms of various sizes.

Dr. Stephen Beaton, CEO and Founder of Circularity Fuels, explains the significance: “Farmers in the US and around the world are sitting on an untapped gold mine. We are enabling them to turn waste into a profitable product that airlines desperately need. For the first time, farmers will become producers of renewable fuels without waiting for pipeline infrastructure that will never come.”

The reactor’s design facilitates seamless conversion from dairy waste to synthesis gas production. Its plug-and-play functionality allows immediate deployment on farms with standard electrical connections, making adoption straightforward for agricultural operations.

The Complete Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis Process from Dairy Farm Biogas

The conversion of dairy farm biogas to jet fuel follows a carefully orchestrated process. It begins with capturing raw biogas from waste lagoons at dairy farms. Currently, less than 6% of available manure waste is captured, highlighting the enormous untapped potential in this market.

The electric reforming system plays a crucial role in this conversion chain. Unlike traditional reformers that require purified biogas, the Ouro reactor processes unrefined biogas directly. This raw biogas contains methane and carbon dioxide from decomposing manure, along with various contaminants that would normally require expensive removal.

Synthesis gas, also known as syngas, serves as the critical intermediate product. This mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen provides the foundation for producing liquid hydrocarbons. The quality and composition of synthesis gas directly impact the efficiency of subsequent fuel production steps.

Fischer-Tropsch synthesis represents the final conversion stage. This catalytic chemical reaction transforms synthesis gas into liquid hydrocarbons suitable for aviation fuel. The process has been used commercially for decades, providing a proven pathway from biogas to jet fuel.

The entire process from biogas to jet fuel embodies Circular Economy principles. Agricultural waste that previously created disposal challenges becomes a valuable feedstock for renewable fuel production. This transformation creates economic value while reducing environmental impact.

SAF production through this method offers several advantages over conventional approaches. The distributed nature of production reduces transportation costs and infrastructure requirements. Farmers gain new revenue streams while contributing to sustainable aviation fuel supply chains.

The scalability of this approach depends on biogas availability and processing capacity. With over 20,000 large livestock farms in the United States producing nearly 500 million tons of manure annually, the potential supply of raw materials is substantial.

Quality control throughout the conversion process ensures the final product meets aviation fuel specifications. The synthesis gas produced by the Ouro reactor maintains consistent composition, supporting reliable Fischer-Tropsch synthesis outcomes.

Economic and Environmental Benefits of On-Farm SAF Production

The economic advantages of on-farm sustainable aviation fuel production are compelling. The 100x cost reduction achieved by the Ouro reactor compared to conventional synthesis gas production methods dramatically improves project economics. This cost reduction stems from eliminating expensive pre-treatment requirements and simplifying the overall process.

Infrastructure cost savings represent another significant economic benefit. Traditional biogas projects often require extensive pipeline networks to transport gas from farms to processing facilities. The Ouro reactor eliminates this requirement by enabling on-site production and transportation via existing trucking networks.

Farmers gain new revenue streams from waste products that previously represented disposal costs. This transformation from cost center to profit center can significantly impact farm economics. The reliability of aviation fuel demand provides predictable income streams that support long-term planning.

Environmental benefits extend beyond carbon emission reductions. Converting manure waste into renewable fuel prevents methane emissions that would otherwise occur during natural decomposition. Methane is approximately 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas, making this conversion particularly valuable.

The technology supports Circular Economy principles by creating closed-loop systems where waste becomes input for valuable products. This approach reduces dependency on fossil fuels while creating sustainable economic models for agricultural operations.

The environmental impact extends to soil and water quality improvements. Proper management of manure through biogas production reduces runoff risks and odor issues associated with traditional lagoon systems. This improvement enhances community relations and environmental stewardship.

Market potential remains largely untapped. With biogas currently captured from less than 6% of available manure waste, significant growth opportunities exist. The combination of environmental benefits and economic incentives creates favorable conditions for widespread adoption.

Sustainable farming practices benefit from this integrated approach. Farmers can demonstrate environmental leadership while improving their economic position. This alignment of environmental and economic goals supports long-term sustainability in agricultural operations.

The broader impact on renewable fuel markets could be substantial. Distributed production from thousands of farms could contribute significantly to sustainable aviation fuel supply, reducing dependency on centralized production facilities and fossil fuel sources.

The Future of Renewable Fuel Production and Industry Impact

Technologies like the Ouro reactor have the potential to reshape the renewable energy landscape fundamentally. By creating decentralized, on-farm fuel production ecosystems, this approach democratizes renewable fuel production and reduces dependency on large-scale industrial facilities.

The aviation industry faces increasing pressure to meet sustainability targets. Sustainable aviation fuel demand is projected to grow exponentially as airlines commit to net-zero emissions goals. Technologies that enable distributed production from agricultural waste could play a crucial role in meeting this demand.

The scalability of cow manure jet fuel production depends on technology adoption rates and infrastructure development. As more farms implement biogas to jet fuel systems, the cumulative impact on renewable fuel supply could be significant. This distributed approach offers resilience benefits compared to centralized production models.

Innovation in waste to energy technologies continues advancing. The success of the Ouro reactor demonstrates the potential for breakthrough technologies to overcome traditional barriers. This progress encourages investment in similar innovations that could expand renewable fuel production capabilities.

The Circular Economy benefits from technologies that create value from waste streams. As cow manure jet fuel production scales, it establishes new economic models where agricultural waste becomes a valuable commodity. This transformation supports sustainable development goals while creating economic opportunities.

Industry partnerships between technology developers, farmers, and airlines could accelerate adoption. These collaborations can provide the financing, technical support, and market access needed for widespread implementation. Strategic partnerships align stakeholder interests around shared sustainability goals.

Regulatory support for renewable fuel production continues evolving. Government incentives and mandates for sustainable aviation fuel create favorable market conditions for technologies like the Ouro reactor. Policy support can accelerate adoption and investment in on-farm fuel production systems.

The long-term vision includes networks of farms producing renewable fuel that supplies regional aviation hubs. This distributed production model could reduce transportation costs and improve supply chain resilience. Local production also supports rural economic development and energy independence.

Research and development efforts focus on improving efficiency and reducing costs further. Continued innovation in electric reforming systems and biogas processing could expand the range of feedstocks and improve economic viability. These advances support broader adoption across diverse agricultural operations.

Pumpkins are grown across the country on more than 68,000 acres, producing roughly 1.4 billion pounds in 2024.

Illinois is by far the top pumpkin producing state with 90% of its crop going to pie filling and canned products.

**Clean Fuels Alliance America wrote to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer asking him to close a loophole in the administration’s Reciprocal Tariffs.

Under the Executive Order, diesel and renewable diesel are both exempted from reciprocal tariffs under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule.

The letter states, this loophole invites duty-free access to the United States for imported renewable diesel, putting U.S. biodiesel, renewable diesel, and sustainable aviation fuel producers at a competitive disadvantage.

While Mercedes offers its eSprinters with a promised 206 mile estimated range, DHL says it’s consistently seen them exceed 240 miles in stop-and-go delivery duty, making them the longest-range battery electric vehicles in DHL’s US fleet.

This extended capacity makes them ideally suited for urban logistics while expanding their potential use in longer delivery routes. The eSprinter vans also offer the same massive cargo capacity as their diesel-powered brothers, making them efficient last-mile delivery solutions that don’t compromise on payload or operational reliability.

And, of course, the eSprinter will do all of that without the noise, vibration, and harmful carbon emissions of diesel.

“Electrifying our fleet is one of the most visible and impactful ways we are moving toward a more sustainable future,” explains Greg Hewitt, CEO of DHL Express, US. “The Mercedes-Benz eSprinter brings an extended range and proven cargo capabilities that allow us to serve our customers with zero emissions, while also advancing our global goal of more sustainable logistics. These vehicles not only strengthen our operations in major US cities but also set the stage for future electric fleet growth across the Americas.”

The 45 eSprinters will see deployment in Chicago, Indiana, and Pittsburg, and will act as a first step DHL’s global Sustainability Roadmap, which will see the company electrify 66% of its last-mile US delivery fleet (and some of its long-haul fleet operations) by 2030.

Electrek’s Take

In addition to these 45 vans, DHL is electrifying its European and Asian delivery fleets, ramping up its sustainable aviation fuel use, and even exploring electric semis, eVTOL and hybrid aircraft deliveries, and more.

In short, they’re doing the right thing – or seem to be, anyway. Whether or not that commitment to decarbonization will win them more American customers remains to be seen.

The company’s renewable products segment reported improved EBTIDA, comparable sales margins and sales volumes for the three-month period.

Heikki Malinen, president and CEO of Neste, said the renewable products segment reported comparable EBTIDA of EUR 266 million for the third quarter, up from EUR 106 million during the same period of last year. The improvement was driven by a stronger comparable sales margin of $480 per ton, up from $341 per ton, and total sales volumes of 1.046 million metric tons, up from 999,000 metric tons during the third quarter of last year. SAF sales volumes increased to a record 251,000 metric tons, up from 112,000 metric tons during the third quarter of 2024. Renewable diesel sales volumes reached 779,000 metric tons, down from 865,000 metric tons, with sales volumes for other renewable products at 16,000 metric tons, down from 22,000 metric tons.

Neste’s biorefineries processed 94% waste and residue feedstock during the third quarter, up from 90% during the same period of last year. Approximately 74% of sales volumes were sold into the European market, with 26% sold to North America, compared to 51% and 49%, respectively, during the third quarter of last year.

According to Neste, the market for renewables during the third quarter was significantly improved when compared to last year. Increased SAF sales and renewable diesel premiums supported profitability during the period. The company’s operations during the third quarter of 2024 were impacted by higher net production costs due to a maintenance shutdown in Rotterdam.

But Ortberg emphasized in a call with analysts that the delays stemmed from the certification process, and not from any newly discovered technical issues.
“While we are disappointed in the 777 delays, it shouldn't overshadow the progress we're making,"" he said.
Ortberg said Boeing was making progress on stabilizing its production.
Boeing also reported that its backlog of orders, including 5,900 commercial planes, had grown to $636 billion in the third quarter.","Boeing reported mixed third-quarter results on Wednesday, as higher aircraft deliveries and a growing backlog of orders were offset by continued certification delays for its 777X jets.

CEO Kelly Ortberg said the first delivery of its next generation of long-haul, wide-body jets is now expected in 2027 instead of 2026, resulting in a $4.9 billion charge in the quarter through September. But Ortberg emphasized in a call with analysts that the delays stemmed from the certification process, and not from any newly discovered technical issues.

“While we are disappointed in the 777 delays, it shouldn't overshadow the progress we're making,"" he said.

Ortberg said Boeing was making progress on stabilizing its production. The aerospace giant delivered 160 planes in the third quarter, the most quarterly deliveries since 2018. The same time last year, Boeing said it delivered 116 planes.

Boeing also reported that its backlog of orders, including 5,900 commercial planes, had grown to $636 billion in the third quarter.

“There’s strong demand in our products,” Ortberg said in an interview Wednesday morning with CNBC.

In September, the Federal Aviation Administration restored Boeing's ability to perform final safety checks and certify 737 Max jets for flight more than six years after two crashes of the then-new aircraft killed 346 people.

That decision was followed by the FAA's move this month to raise Boeing's 737 Max production limit that it had set in January 2024, after a door plug flew off an Alaska Airlines jet. Boeing is now allowed to build 42 Max jets per month, up from 38, and Ortberg said Wednesday that the company expects to raise that cap further once it demonstrates to the FAA that it can do so safely.

If the FAA approves future production boosts, Ortberg said, they'd come in increments of five jets and wouldn't happen more than once every six months.

“We won’t move to higher rates until we reach stability and readiness,” he said.

Boeing also reported $238 million in free cash flow, marking its first cash flow-positive quarter since 2023. But that figure was partly boosted by a delay in a potential $700 million payment to the Justice Department, part of a still-pending deal under consideration by a federal judge that could spare Boeing from criminal prosecution in the two deadly 737 Max crashes.

The crashes off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia happened less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019 and were later blamed on a new software system that Boeing developed for the aircraft.

Meanwhile, a strike was ongoing at three Midwest plants in the St. Louis area. About 3,200 machinists who build military jets and weapons systems walked off the job on Aug. 4 as negotiations stalled over key issues, including retirement benefits and wage increases.

The workers rejected Boeing's latest contract offer over the weekend. It was the fourth time that the workers voted against a proposed deal.

“If Boeing is serious about culture change and rebuilding its brand, it starts with respecting the people who make its success possible,” the union representing the workers said Wednesday in a statement after Boeing posted its quarterly results.

The strike is smaller in scale than a walkout last year by 33,000 workers who assemble commercial jetliners but still threatens to complicate the company’s progress in regaining its financial footing.

Boeing said Wednesday it was still carrying out its “contingency plan” during the latest strike, which the company has said includes hiring replacement workers and leaning on its non-union workers during the work stoppage.

Total renewable fuel sales were 63,000 barrels per day, down from 70,000 barrels per day.
For the first nine months of the year, Phillips 66 produced 40,000 barrels per day of renewables, up from 28,000 barrels per day during the same period of 2024, with sales of 66,000 barrels per day, up from 50,000 barrels per day.
We also anticipate continuing to increase our SAF production in Q4, and we’ve seen strong interest from SAF buyers.","Phillips 66 doubled its production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) during the third quarter of 2025 and expects additional increases in production to be realized during the fourth quarter, according to statements made during the company’s third quarter earnings call on Oct. 29.

The company’s renewable fuels business segment processes renewable feedstocks into renewable fuels at its Rodeo facility in California and the Humber refinery in the U.K. The segment also includes global activities to procure renewable feedstocks, manage certain regulatory credits and market renewable fuels.

Development on the Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex began in mid-2022 and the facility reached full processing rates during the second quarter of 2024. The biorefinery began producing SAF in September 2024. According to Phillips 66, the facility has the capacity to produce approximately 50,000 barrels per day (800 MMgy) of renewable fuels.

The third quarter improvement is primarily attributed to improved margins driven by optimized feedstock volumes and higher international credits, partially offset by unfavorable inventory impacts. The decrease for the first nine months of the year was primarily driven by decreased margins as a result of increased feedstock volumes and unfavorable inventory impacts, partially offset by increased credit production.

The company produced 36,000 barrels per day of renewable fuels during the third quarter, down from 44,000 barrels per day produced during the same period of last year. Total renewable fuel sales were 63,000 barrels per day, down from 70,000 barrels per day. For the first nine months of the year, Phillips 66 produced 40,000 barrels per day of renewables, up from 28,000 barrels per day during the same period of 2024, with sales of 66,000 barrels per day, up from 50,000 barrels per day. The company did not break down renewable production and sales volumes by fuel type in its third quarter report.

During a third quarter earnings call, Brian Mandell, executive vice president of marketing and commercial at Phillips 66, noted that overall renewable margins were down in the third quarter, but Phillips 66 was able to benefit through various “self-help” measures. “We reduced costs,” he said. “we improved our logistics, particularly to get more domestic feedstock. We sent more of our renewable products to the Pacific Northwest where fossil basis were strong. We got a lot of value from some new pathways we got. We doubled SAF production, and…we had the timing of the European credits.”

Moving into the fourth quarter, Mandell said renewables margins are improving with weaker soybean prices and relatively stronger credit values. “We think the industry will continue to run at about the same rates as they did in Q3 given the turnaround activity,” he said. “The European market will continue to attract renewable products.

Key aviation and aerospace organisations – including ASD – have written to Commissioners Wopke Hoekstra and Apostolos Tzitzikostas, calling for a credible STIP that mitigates market distortions in Europe’s nascent sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) market.

Dear Commissioner Hoekstra, Dear Commissioner Tzitzikostas,

We, the undersigned associations, who jointly represent Europe’s aviation ecosystem, are writing to reiterate the messages set out in our Joint Industry Letter on Sustainable Aviation Fuels and Book & Claim of 17 February 2025, co-signed by manufacturers, airlines, airports, fuel suppliers and logistics partners across Europe, ahead of the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) publication next week.

Scaling the production and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) remains essential to achieve Europe’s climate goals while safeguarding competitiveness. The first months of SAF mandates have demonstrated that the system needs additional flexibility for offtakers to stimulate the SAF market. Current regulatory and market constraints are slowing down investment and deployment. We ask that the STIP explicitly supports the introduction of a Book & Claim (B&C) system and commits to ensuring it is compatible with the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) as part of its ongoing review. We also call on the STIP to channel EU ETS revenues towards financing SAF production and uptake, and to provide clear political direction on increasing and extending SAF allowances to accelerate the sector’s decarbonisation.

In particular, we call on the Commission to:

Include Book & Claim in the STIP implementation to enable SAF distribution and uptake across all EU airports, regardless of physical availability.

Allow purchase-based claiming of SAF under EU ETS through necessary amendments in the upcoming EU ETS Review, enabling aircraft operators to reduce their EU ETS obligations under the applicable scope by claiming the use of SAF from all Union Airports.

Extend to aircraft operators the flexibility mechanism applicable to fuel suppliers under ReFuelEU Aviation.

Ensure robust accounting and digital traceability of SAF attributes for fuel suppliers and aircraft operators via the Union Database for Biofuels, preventing double counting while unlocking investment in EU SAF projects.

Include in the STIP a political direction on increasing and extending SAF allowance.

Introducing Book & Claim now is crucial to avoid market distortions, accelerate SAF deployment, and deliver on Europe’s climate and competitiveness ambitions. The forthcoming STIP is also a key opportunity to mobilise public and private funding to bridge the price gap for airlines , including through the recycling of EU ETS revenues to finance SAF production and uptake, and by providing political direction on increasing and extending SAF allowances. Together, these measures will enable the industry to competitively decarbonise, strengthen Europe’s strategic autonomy, and turn sustainable aviation into an economic success story for the EU.",https://www.asd-europe.org/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-29 19:56:51.422094

The expansion will see Neste supply SAF to three more major U.S. airports, including George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) in Houston, Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), and Dulles International Airport (IAD). This move reinforces United’s ongoing efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and accelerate the aviation industry’s transition to greener fuel alternatives.

New Airports Join United’s SAF Network

United Airlines, which has been actively involved in the promotion and adoption of sustainable aviation practices, has expanded its SAF supply to these additional airports as part of its sustainability strategy. As of July 2025, Neste began supplying SAF at Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport, marking a milestone in the airline’s effort to reduce carbon emissions. The SAF deliveries at IAH are scheduled to continue through October 2025.

In September 2025, the collaboration between United and Neste expanded to include both Newark Liberty and Dulles International airports. SAF deliveries will run through the remainder of the year, with plans to continue in the future. By adding these three major airports to the network, United Airlines is taking a further step toward its ambitious goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

The Importance of SAF in Sustainable Aviation

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a key component in reducing the aviation sector’s environmental impact. SAF is made from renewable sources, such as waste oils, agricultural residues, or non-food-based crops, and can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

By increasing the use of SAF at more airports, United Airlines is helping to set a new standard for eco-friendly air travel. SAF also plays a crucial role in improving local air quality around airports by reducing the harmful emissions associated with fossil fuels. As more airports adopt SAF, it not only helps the airline meet its sustainability targets but also supports the global goal of lowering carbon emissions in the aviation industry.

United Airlines has been at the forefront of integrating SAF into its operations. Previously, the airline has worked with Neste to provide SAF at other airports, including Chicago O’Hare International and San Francisco International Airport. United’s broader commitment to SAF, seen in this new expansion, is part of its strategic vision to reduce the aviation industry’s reliance on traditional jet fuels.

Benefits for United Airlines and Its Passengers

For United Airlines, expanding SAF usage is not only a step towards sustainability but also a way to address the increasing demand for eco-friendly travel options. Passengers are becoming more conscious of the environmental impact of their travel decisions, and this move by United to provide SAF at more airports signals a commitment to offering greener alternatives.

Brett Hart, President of United Airlines, has emphasized that collaboration is key to accelerating the shift towards SAF. The airline’s partnership with Neste is crucial in making SAF more widely available. Hart also acknowledged the importance of government support, particularly through policies such as SAF tax credits, which have enabled easier access to these sustainable fuel options. United’s use of SAF at its expanded airports will provide more sustainable flight options to passengers, helping the airline meet its carbon reduction goals.

Neste’s Role in Expanding SAF Supply

Neste’s role in providing SAF to United Airlines is critical to the growth of the sustainable aviation fuel industry. Neste has committed to scaling up the production of SAF, with plans to increase its global production capacity. By supplying SAF to key airports in the U.S., Neste is helping pave the way for widespread adoption of sustainable aviation fuel, making it more accessible to a broader range of airlines.

Neste’s SAF is produced from renewable feedstocks, and the company’s extensive network ensures that airlines like United can efficiently access SAF at key airports. The expansion of SAF availability at major hubs like Houston, Newark, and Dulles is a key milestone in the evolution of green aviation, as it signals that SAF is becoming a viable alternative for fueling commercial flights on a larger scale.

The Bigger Picture: A Shift Toward Sustainable Aviation

The aviation industry is under increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint as part of the global effort to combat climate change. Aviation accounts for a significant portion of global emissions, and switching to SAF is one of the most effective ways to reduce these emissions without requiring major changes to existing aircraft or airport infrastructure.

United’s partnership with Neste is part of a broader trend in the aviation industry, where many airlines are seeking to integrate SAF into their operations. As governments continue to support the adoption of SAF through tax incentives and regulatory frameworks, the production and distribution of sustainable aviation fuel will continue to grow, making it more affordable and accessible for airlines worldwide.

What’s Next for United Airlines and SAF

Looking ahead, United Airlines plans to further expand its SAF usage across more airports in the coming years. The airline has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2050, with SAF playing a pivotal role in meeting these targets. United also aims to increase the percentage of its fleet powered by SAF, helping to lead the way in aviation sustainability.

For passengers, the expansion of SAF at key airports like Houston, Newark, and Dulles ensures that they can travel with a more eco-conscious airline. The move reflects a growing demand for sustainable travel options and shows that airlines are actively responding to the environmental concerns of modern travelers.

Conclusion

The expansion of SAF delivery to three more major U.S. airports is a positive step forward for United Airlines and the aviation industry as a whole. By continuing its partnership with Neste, United is not only advancing its sustainability goals but also helping to set the standard for greener air travel. With SAF reducing emissions and improving local air quality, this initiative represents a crucial part of the aviation industry’s future — one that’s more sustainable and environmentally friendly.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/images-of-united-airlines-planes-at-hous_JmsVKy1TTpWCyL5jYCd6Lg_Shd9NlXXTxOWuNU8MIRdZA.jpeg,N,,2025-10-29 17:56:20.546352

The agency’s data reveal that national biofuel production capacity increased by just 3% from the start of 2024 to early 2025, primarily due to a marked deceleration in the renewable diesel segment and increased sector rationalisation.

Renewable diesel and other biofuels—including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable naphtha, and renewable propane—grew only 391 million gallons per year (gal/y). This is less than one-third the annual growth levels seen in 2022 and 2023. In 2024, only two significant capacity additions entered service, both in California: Phillips 66 completed its conversion of the Rodeo refinery exclusively to biofuels, now rated at 767 million gal/y (up from 180 million gal/y the year before), making it the country’s second-largest facility behind Diamond Green Diesel’s 982-million-gal/y plant in Norco, Louisiana. The new Renewable Fuels LLC plant in Bakersfield also came online with 138 million gal/y of capacity.

However, these gains were partially offset by the closure of four facilities: Monroe Energy and Chevron discontinued renewable diesel co-processing at plants in Trainer, Pennsylvania, and El Segundo, California, respectively, while Vertex Energy and Jaxon Energy shut down plants in Alabama and Mississippi, respectively. These shutdowns reflect tighter margins for biofuels and robust profitability for petroleum refining, which discouraged new investments for the coming years.

Meanwhile, the SAF segment is gaining momentum. Phillips 66’s Rodeo plant can now shift 150 million gal/y of renewable diesel to SAF, while Diamond Green Diesel can reallocate about 235 million gal/y. This refocus aligns with growing demand for low-carbon aviation fuels.

Biodiesel capacity actually fell, with eight plants closing in 2024 due to unfavourable margins, reducing output by roughly 100 million gal/y.

Conversely, U.S. fuel ethanol production capacity increased more in 2024 than in prior years, now comprising 73% of the nation’s total biofuel capacity (nearly 18.5 billion gal/y). Most ethanol production remains centred in the Midwest, with the rise in capacity primarily supporting growing export demand rather than increased domestic use.

Earlier this year, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association published a report, A Reliable Grid for an Electric Future, that projects that national electricity demand will rise more than 50% by 2050. Some industry observers worry utilities are ill-equipped to handle such fast load growth. Data centers, transportation electrification and manufacturing operations remain at risk from power disruptions. At the same time, much of the US’ transmission and distribution network is decades old. NEMA says those factors make modernization a near-term necessity rather than a long-term aspiration.

The report provided useful information that set the stage for NEMA and the GridWise Alliance’s recent Congressional Grid Innovation Expo, where the industry had a chance to discuss ongoing projects and technological developments that enhance grid reliability. ABB, INDT and other GridWise Alliance members revealed products that suggest the future of grid reliability will succeed based on how well the power system implements data management and predictive control systems. The products support a lofty goal: To extend equipment life and prevent faults and failures before breakdowns happen.

Demand Growth and System Stress

Electricity use in the United States is climbing at the fastest rate in a generation. Data centers alone are expected to increase their consumption by 300% over the next decade, according to NEMA’s analysis. Artificial intelligence workloads generate one-quarter of the total growth in this market. The current requirement for individual facilities exceeds 100 megawatts, which creates excessive pressure on nearby substations and transmission lines.

ABB engineers believe they have solved this problem through the implementation of artificial intelligence technology that now operates within their grid monitoring and fault prediction systems. One system they developed in 2018 uses real-time operational data analysis to detect minor voltage and current irregularities which typically signal upcoming faults. The model achieves 95% confidence in failure precursor detection, which enables utilities to detect and solve potential issues before they cause service disruptions. ABB says it has demonstrated through its European operations that big organizations can achieve major reliability enhancements by implementing data collection and analytics integration at scale.

Another major factor that creates new market demand stems from transportation electrification. NEMA projects that power consumption from electric vehicle charging will grow nearly 9000 percent by mid-century. Roughly 55 million light-duty electric vehicles are expected on US roads by 2035. These vehicles will create new patterns of customer demand by generating more traffic during evening and nighttime hours while creating big consumption zones near charging stations. This requires scheduling charging operations according to renewable power availability and storage capacity to achieve stability.

The process of building and industrial electrification creates an additional level of complexity. The transition to electric heat pumps and induction processes and other non-combustion systems results in higher total energy consumption and produces more concentrated peak demand periods. Installation of rooftop solar systems and behind-the-meter batteries can lead to intermittent backflow that standard distribution networks aren’t designed to handle.

Meanwhile, the regional distribution of growth is uneven. PJM and ERCOT experience fast-growing demand because of data center operations, but northeastern and western states face higher demand from electric vehicle charging and building power consumption. The installation of renewable energy systems will reach more than 50% in multiple regions during 2050, but their unpredictable power output needs stable power sources, including natural gas plants and nuclear reactors and extended storage systems.

Policy Framework and Supply Chain Readiness

Regulatory and supply chain conditions will determine whether modernization can keep pace with demand. NEMA has identified three key areas which need improvement to create immediate results: Permitting processes, tax and trade policy systems, and domestic manufacturing transparency systems.

The process of obtaining permits stands as the main obstacle blocking project development. The review process for transmission projects requires developers to wait multiple years before they can begin construction. NEMA supports federal-state process alignment for environmental requirements and grid-enhancing technology deployment to enhance power grid capacity through existing transmission corridors. The process of expansion would become faster through streamlined procedures which maintain proper monitoring.

The Inflation Reduction Act established financial incentives for grid development, but its unclear implementation procedures have restricted the number of organizations participating in the program. And the unpredictable nature of tariff policies, together with multiple electrical component exemptions, makes it difficult to procure goods and deters businesses from entering into extended contractual agreements.

The US–Mexico–Canada Agreement serves as the main framework for international trade component procurement. The right import policies will help maintain stable transformer and conductor supplies while protecting domestic manufacturing operations. The proposed LEAP Act expansion of technical apprenticeships through its programs would solve the existing skills shortage problem in manufacturing and field maintenance.

NEMA has attempted to address sourcing transparency through its Make It American BABA registry. The program maintains a database of American-made electrical products which fulfill both Buy America and Build America standards. The registry allows public agencies and their contractors to verify compliance status while discovering domestic suppliers through a new system which eliminates conventional certification procedures. The goal is to reduce delays in procurement, strengthen visibility into US manufacturing capacity and turn a regulatory mandate into a practical planning tool.

From Reactive to Preventive Operations

The reliability challenge increasingly depends on visibility. Many outages occur because utilities cannot detect early signs of mechanical or electrical stress. New approaches from ABB and IND Technology (INDT) demonstrate how complementary technologies can close that information gap.

ABB’s predictive fault management platform illustrates how data science can support operational decision-making. The system uses artificial intelligence to analyze real-time measurements of current, phase angle, and power quality. By comparing these data points with historical fault signatures, the software can identify patterns that precede equipment failure. When it detects conditions likely to worsen over the following days or weeks, operators receive alerts that allow targeted maintenance before a disruption occurs.

The value of ABB’s approach lies in its ability to integrate predictive analytics with existing grid management systems. When paired with automated switching and dispatch tools, it enables utilities to isolate faults more quickly and restore service faster. Utilities using this kind of analytics report measurable reductions in both outage frequency and duration, as well as lower maintenance costs from more focused field interventions.

INDT’s technology operates at a different level of the grid. Rather than analyzing system-wide electrical data, it focuses on the physical condition of transmission and distribution lines. The company’s sensor-based monitoring system detects defects such as cracked insulators or loosened fittings that often lead to faults. Sensors installed every few miles along transmission routes capture radio-frequency patterns that shift when small arcing events or mechanical vibrations occur. These changes are processed in the cloud, and the system generates precise geographic coordinates for maintenance crews.

The platform, originally developed and tested in Australia, improved network reliability by roughly 50 percent in long-term trials. It is now deployed across twelve of the twenty largest US utilities and recently completed a 16,000-mile installation in communities with limited previous grid investment. By turning inspection from a periodic task into a continuous process, INDT’s method lowers operational expenses while improving safety and service quality.

Using Existing Infrastructure More Efficiently

NEMA’s study identifies several technologies capable of unlocking substantial capacity increases. The use of advanced materials for reconductoring would enable the generation of 110 gigawatts of additional power. The installation of dynamic line ratings that adjust current limits based on temperature and wind conditions would lead to an additional 80 gigawatts of power generation. The combination of smart grid systems and advanced metering infrastructure would generate approximately 25 gigawatts of power through enhanced monitoring capabilities and better control of electricity usage.

Utilities have started using these methods in their current operations. The sensors from LineVision monitor conductor temperature and sag continuously to establish safe operating limits in real-time which results in a 10 to 20 percent increase in production capacity without requiring additional equipment. The GridWrap system provides mechanical strength to poles and towers through reinforcement which protects them from storms that cause capacity reductions. Organizations can extend their asset lifespan through these methods which delay their need for significant capital expenditures.

Storage and Flexible Resources

Energy storage is expanding faster than any other category of grid infrastructure. NEMA projects that installed storage capacity will grow more than tenfold over the next fifteen years. Short-duration batteries operate to stabilize wind and solar plant power output while long-duration systems function as backup power systems for prolonged power disruptions. Customers who install behind-the-meter systems gain control over their expenses while protecting themselves from power disruptions.

At the Expo, Siemens highlighted the Bronzeville Community Microgrid in Chicago, operated by ComEd. The system combines distributed solar generation, energy storage, and a Siemens controller that allows the microgrid to operate independently during wider grid outages. Similar configurations are being deployed at hospitals, universities, and industrial sites to improve local reliability and reduce peak demand.

Smarter Transformers and Digital Equipment

The power grid contains transformers which represent its most exposed system elements. Many units in service today are more than thirty years old and the supply of new ones is constrained by material and manufacturing limits. The integration of intelligence into these devices creates an efficient solution to boost system dependability until manufacturers can replace them entirely.

Attendees at the expo had an opportunity to see the Prolec-GE smart transformer platform, which contains sensors which track temperature data and vibration patterns and acoustic signals that indicate partial discharge occurrences. The on-board processors analyze data within their system to provide immediate responses when they detect any irregularities. The transformers establish secure connections with utility control systems through standard communication protocols which include MQTT and IEC 61850. The system operates as a bidirectional power flow system which enables distributed generation and microgrid operations.

The transformation allows transformers to take part in system management operations through active system participation. The system provides instant warning alerts about system deterioration while its control system preserves voltage stability through distributed resource power adjustments. Prolec research suggests that predictive maintenance techniques allow transformers to operate for extended periods while minimizing the requirement for new transformer units.

The industry has started to develop new methods which share similarities with these approaches. ABB achieves real-time coordination through direct analytics integration with its switchgear and substation systems. Hitachi Energy has initiated two manufacturing expansion projects in Virginia and Canada while it works to eliminate SF₆ gas from its equipment to achieve environmental sustainability. The modular microgrid systems from Schneider Electric enable faster project completion while providing uniform control systems. Lutron maintains its focus on building automation system development and lighting control solutions which enable users to monitor their energy usage.

Outlook

Electricity demand in the US is rising faster than the capacity of the generation and transmission system. Meeting that growth will depend on how effectively the country links technology, policy and domestic manufacturing.

Many of the necessary tools are already in place. Predictive analytics, sensor networks, grid-enhancing technologies, smart transformers, and advanced storage systems can all be deployed today to deliver measurable gains in reliability and resilience. NEMA’s Make It American BABA registry, along with supporting policy frameworks, strengthens the manufacturing foundation needed to scale those solutions.

Progress will hinge on three areas: streamlined permitting, consistent trade policy, and sustained investment in workforce development. Together, they form the conditions for modernization at the speed the economy now requires.

The grid that results from these efforts will operate with greater visibility and flexibility. It will rely on continuous data rather than scheduled inspection and on predictive maintenance rather than reactive repair. Success will depend on close coordination among utilities, manufacturers, and policymakers, but the essential technologies and methods are already proven. The next step is to apply them with the scope and urgency that a fully electrified economy demands.

The new agreement will increase the overall scale of the commercial relationship between the two companies to more than 1.3 GW across four Texas-based projects.

The latest PPAs cover Engie’s new 600 MW Swenson Ranch Solar project in Stonewall county, Texas. It is expected to be Engie’s single largest asset in its 11 GW portfolio of solar, wind and battery storage assets in North America, with planned investment reaching $900 million.

The 600 MW project will be operational in 2027, with Meta purchasing 100% of the site’s output to support its data center operations in the U.S.

Dave Carroll, CEO and Chief Renewables Officer at Engie North America, said:

“Our objective is to bring reliable, cost competitive power to the grid as rapidly as possible, and projects like Swenson demonstrate the importance of solar to meet the timely needs of our customers.”

Meta has set a target to reach net-zero emissions across its value chain by 2030. The company achieved its goal to meet 100% of its operational energy needs with renewable sources in 2020, and recently said that it anticipates adding 9.8 GW of renewable energy to local grids in the U.S. by the end of 2025.

The new agreement follows a renewable energy supply deal between the two companies earlier this year, in which Engie agreed to provide 200 MW of renewable energy and associated environmental attributes to Meta from its Anson 2 solar project, as well as a 260 MW deal announced last year.

""Honeywell continues to drive innovation in the areas that our customers need most,"" said Ken West, president of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions. ""The maritime industry has a real need for renewable fuels that are immediately available and cost effective. Our Biocrude Upgrading processing technology can be delivered in modular form, offering savings from the point of installation through to refining and use.""

Plant and agricultural waste can be converted into lower carbon biocrude at the feedstock collection sites, which keeps transport costs low. Honeywell's new process technology enables biocrude to then be refined at major facilities to produce marine fuel, gasoline or SAF. This helps solve long-standing challenges with converting biocrudes into fuels with performance comparable to conventional fuel.

Biocrude Upgrading process technology can be delivered in the form of a prefabricated modular plant. As a result, Honeywell can help customers reduce risk and accelerate project timelines by simplifying site construction activity.

The introduction of Honeywell's Biocrude Upgrading process technology comes as shipping companies seek to reduce their carbon footprints due to customer demands and regulatory drivers. Since the 1960s, heavy fuel oil—residual products from the refining of gasoline, diesel, and kerosene—has been the principal energy source for the maritime sector and a main source of its roughly 3% contribution of global greenhouse gas emissions1.

In rice paddies near Sacramento, Jeremy Alexander waded knee-deep into murky water, collecting soil samples that most people would dismiss as ordinary mud.

But Alexander saw something else entirely: a hidden world of microorganisms that could revolutionize how we clean water and protect human health.

“I innovate in the spaces most overlook,” explains Alexander, a USC Viterbi School of Engineering junior majoring in biomedical engineering with a minor in marine biology. “These places hold hidden complexities, and discovery in these spaces can change how we live.”

Alexander’s work — spanning everything from microscopic bacteria to rocket fuel chemistry — exemplifies the kind of boundary-pushing research that the Doug Peacock Scholarship was designed to support. The scholarship, established by TransDigm Group Inc. in 2021, provides financial support to underrepresented students in STEM fields and has enabled more than 105 USC Viterbi students to pursue ambitious research projects. TransDigm, headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, is a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components.

For Alexander, the scholarship opened doors that might otherwise have remained closed. It connected him to TransDigm’s network, leading to a summer internship at TA Aerospace, a TransDigm operating unit, where he discovered that “invisible chemistry decides visible safety.”

At TA Aerospace, Alexander tested elastomer seals — flexible, rubber-like materials that prevent fuel leaks in aircraft and spacecraft engines — analyzing how different types of fuel affected their performance. He exposed these specialized rubber seals to both sustainable aviation fuel and military-grade JP8 fuel, then tested whether they could still stretch without breaking, resist tearing and hold up under extreme temperatures and pressures. Using advanced chemical analysis techniques, he identified specific compounds in the fuel mixtures while also researching PFAS — the so-called “forever chemicals” that don’t break down in the environment and pose growing health risks.

“The most rewarding aspect,” Alexander reflected, “was knowing my work fed into a chain of protection that ultimately keeps people alive in the air, from passengers to astronauts.”

Said Michele Starrs, TA Aerospace president: “By offering internships and hands-on experiences, we don’t just view USC students as future hires — we see them as collaborators in solving real engineering challenges. Connecting early helps students understand how different parts of the business operate, and it enables us to nurture talent that is already familiar with our culture, values and technical demands. Jeremy brought specific enthusiasm to the idea of environmental sustainability and helped kick off research into how our industry can begin to phase out PFAS, or ‘forever chemicals.’”

That connection between invisible processes and human survival threads through all of Alexander’s research. In Professor Adam Smith’s environmental engineering lab at USC, he cultivates specialized microbes for nutrient removal in wastewater treatment. Working alongside Ph.D. student Raven Althouse, Alexander has analyzed more than 250 ion chromatography samples and maintained bioreactors at precise conditions to understand how microorganisms can transform nitrogen cycles.

Last May, his poster on membrane biofilm reactors earned second place in a research symposium for the Sonny Astani Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering. When asked to explain his research as a bedtime story, Alexander offers this simple version: “There are tiny bugs in the water, too small to see but strong enough to eat pollution. When we give them the right kind of home, they clean the water for us, turning something dirty into something safe for our health.”

The rice paddy samples Alexander collected last summer are still being analyzed for microbial communities, heavy metals and PFAS contamination. Rice paddies’ waterlogged, oxygen-poor soils create natural environments for organisms like Anammox and n-DAMO — microbes that link nitrogen and methane cycling in ways critical to both agriculture and climate.

PFAS compounds have become a recurring theme in Alexander’s work, appearing both in the high-performance aerospace materials he studied at TA Aerospace and in the environmental samples he analyzes at USC.

“I didn’t choose PFAS as a research focus; its ubiquity in both aerospace and the environment made it impossible to ignore,” he said. “The same chemistry that makes PFAS nearly indestructible for engineering also makes them nearly impossible to remove from the environment.”

Alexander’s research interests extend beyond the laboratory. As a certified scientific diver through USC’s Wrigley Institute on Catalina Island, he has journeyed to the ocean floor, studying invertebrates. His most memorable dives were at night, descending into total darkness to recover lost objects while lobsters crawled over rocks and fish darted through kelp forests.

“That experience captured what I love about research in any setting — whether underwater, in soils, or in reactors,” Alexander says. “The most important discoveries often come when you step into places that feel unfamiliar and find novelty in what others might overlook.”

Looking toward the future, Alexander doesn’t dream of planting flags on Mars, but he does dream of “making sure the person who does can thrive there.” He envisions engineering microbial and natural systems that recycle air and water in closed habitats, developing novel polymers and coatings that resist radiation and volatile fuels.

“For me,” Alexander notes, “space is not a backdrop but a test: how can we protect human health when the environment turns hostile?”

Beyond his research pursuits, Alexander brings an eclectic curiosity to everything he does. He’s interested in toxicology and venoms, conserves ancient artifacts in USC’s archaeology lab, and has earned certifications in everything from pharmacy technology to bear identification from Idaho Fish and Game. He’s also learning guitar, practices early morning swims and admits to drinking two glasses of milk daily.

“One thing I’d say is that I’m a jolly person,” Alexander says with characteristic enthusiasm. “I laugh easily, I’m quick to joy, and I can find fun in just about anything.”

Without the Doug Peacock Scholarship, Alexander believes his curiosity would still be alive, “but my reach wouldn’t be as vast.” The scholarship provided not just financial support, but connections that transformed his academic trajectory — from aerospace internships to research opportunities that span from microscopic organisms to space exploration.

“Whether the system is a reactor, a spacecraft, or another planet, the goal is the same,” Alexander said. “To turn fragile conditions into places where people can survive and thrive.”

Sustainable aviation fuel is a lower-carbon alternative produced from sources such as used cooking oils and fats, municipal waste, or from renewable energy sources. Development and production of SAF is capital intensive and global supply is limited.

The UK government currently imposes a ‘SAF mandate’ on the aviation industry that 2% of aviation fuel used in the UK must be SAF. This target is set to rise to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.

Transport accounted for around 30% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2023, and aviation was the second largest contributor of that figure. The government has said that SAF is one of the most effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation, as SAF is a ‘drop-in fuel’ that does not require modifications to existing aircraft. The government has claimed the bill would support SAF production in the UK by providing revenue certainty and thereby reducing risk to investors in SAF production facilities.

During the bill’s House of Commons stages there was broad cross-party support for the bill, and it passed with only minor, technical government amendments.",https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/Energy.png,N,,2025-10-29 14:56:24.031189

It comes as plans to enlarge key hubs like Heathrow and Gatwick risk compromising the nation’s legally-binding net-zero commitments.

The Commons Environmental Audit Committee has warned that, without new safeguards, these expansions could push the UK beyond its carbon budgets.

The committee's report notes that current government policies are not sufficient to reduce carbon emissions from the aviation sector in line with statutory targets.

This is compounded by expectations of rising demand for air travel. further jeopardising national emission plans.

Air freight and economic targets

Following Labour's 2024 general election victory, Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves approved new runways at both Heathrow and Gatwick.

For the government, the expansions represent vital components of its economic growth strategy.

The importance of Heathrow for UK trade is considerable, with more than 60% of the nation's air freight passing through the airport. This capacity is essential for connecting manufacturers to global markets.

“Heathrow is at the heart of the UK’s openness as a country,"" notes Reeves.

Reeves also points to Heathrow's ability to connect the UK to emerging markets and the fact it hosted around 15 million business travellers in 2023.

The committee has challenged this perspective, however, stating: ""The government has not demonstrated that the economic growth from airport expansion provides enough benefit to outweigh the negative climate and environmental impacts it will lead to.""

John McDonnell, Labour’s MP for Hayes and Harlington, previously wrote on social media that the Heathrow expansion was ""huge political economic and especially environmental mistake"" that could inflict ""irreparable scale of damage on the government"".

Sustainable aviation fuel production concerns

A significant part of the government's aviation decarbonisation plan relies on adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The committee has raised doubts about this strategy, highlighting that SAF is not yet being produced or used at a commercial scale.

This dependency on an emerging technology could pose a risk to achieving emission targets.

The challenge was underlined last year when Air New Zealand had to scrap its 2030 decarbonisation target, citing difficulties in securing a stable supply of SAF.

This brings into question whether the aviation industry can meet its decarbonisation promises without proven and scalable alternatives to conventional jet fuel.

Outdated policy and decarbonisation pressure

The planned expansions are set to begin before the government updates its national policy statement on airports, a document last released in 2018.

The committee argues this allows the government to avoid scrutiny and base decisions on a framework inconsistent with current climate objectives.

Toby Perkins, the Labour Chair of the committee, warns that meeting decarbonisation targets is already a considerable challenge.

""Expanding airport capacity is likely to make that task much harder,"" Toby says. ""Under the government's existing 'jet zero' strategy, expanding airport capacity is likely to put net zero at serious risk.""

Alethea Warrington, Head of Aviation at climate charity Possible, describes the committee's report as the ""final nail in the coffin"" for the government's case.

She says: ""The government's scrutiny committee has made it clearer than ever that airport growth is a bad option for Britain, and that the government simply doesn't have any economic evidence to justify the environmental devastation this would cause.""

In response, a spokesperson from the Department for Transport said: ""We have been clear that airport expansion will only go ahead if it aligns with our legal obligations on climate change, including net zero, and we will be seeking advice from the independent Climate Change Committee to inform the review.""",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/015db0eed64dbb49bcf15b3a340517fb:3bd63977912f8defd924cea7dec8e8b2/wagtailsource-heathrow-airport-height-1200-format-webp.webp.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 13:57:18.546572

— Ron Kotrba, Editor and Publisher, Biobased Diesel Daily®

WARREN, MN, UNITED STATES, October 29, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Biobased Diesel Daily® (biobased-diesel.com), the leading biofuels news outlet specifically focused on the biodiesel, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and marine biofuel sectors of the global energy economy, is celebrating five years of successful operation since its launch.

Founded amid the changing biofuels landscape of 2020 by veteran industry writer and award-winning editor Ron Kotrba in order to better serve those who manufacture biofuels, develop projects and supply producers with vital equipment, goods and services to do so—as well as the broader market up and down the supply chain—Biobased Diesel Daily® was formed as a purpose-driven outlet covering biobased fuels specifically made for heavy-duty and hard-to-abate segments like trucking, construction, rail, heating, marine and aviation.

Now with more than 20 years of experience in the field as a writer, senior writer, editor, senior editor, editor-in-chief and publisher, Kotrba offers his take on what has made the Biobased Diesel® product line—including Biobased Diesel Daily® (biobased-diesel.com), Biobased Diesel™ Weekly and the Biobased Diesel® print magazine—such a success over the past five years.

“Five years ago, the energy markets were very different than they are today,” Kotrba says. “And the biofuels industries and markets within the larger energy sector have changed drastically too. But what hasn’t seemed to really change is how biofuels media moguls and their sprawling, bloated enterprises do their jobs and operate their businesses. After years covering these evolving markets, and years working within and learning how the biofuels news and magazine establishment operates—including how many of them truly do a disservice to their readers, advertisers and industries they purport to serve—I launched the Biobased Diesel® product line to show there is a better way.”

Shortly after debuting as a startup alternative in this competitive field, Biobased Diesel Daily®, Biobased Diesel™ Weekly and the Biobased Diesel® print journal grew in popularity and gained the trust of readers around the world, as well as dozens of advertising clients representing the largest companies in the space to smaller enterprises as well as various organizations and associations.

The once-alternative source of news, information and perspective for biodiesel, renewable diesel, SAF and marine biofuel is now a leading industry trade publication with nearly 5,000 articles published on Biobased Diesel Daily® since its introduction—despite the lack of an executive team, board members and sales, editorial, marketing and circulation staff.

“The success of the Biobased Diesel® line is precisely because I do not have overpaid, underwhelming executives, a commission-driven sales staff and an unmotivated or inattentive news crew on the payroll,” Kotrba says. “With the exception of an excellent contracted designer for the Biobased Diesel® print publication, I alone own, produce and operate this publication from start to finish—including editorial, sales, circulation and more.”

As a result, the Biobased Diesel® line is able to provide advertising packages to its existing and prospective clients for just a fraction of what its competitors charge, even if they were to provide deep discounts to their high prices.

Plus, with Kotrba’s vast network of industry connections and more than two decades of experience, he is able to assemble and curate the largest collection of original print articles written by the biggest, most well-known names and top experts in the field—issue after issue.

In fact, the Winter 2026 Biobased Diesel® print magazine is currently in development. Sales are open but space is filling up fast. For those interested in being part of the issue, please contact Kotrba to reserve advertising placement by Nov. 10.

The Winter 2026 Biobased Diesel® will receive special bonus distribution at two leading biofuel events this winter—the Clean Fuels Conference in Orlando, Florida, Jan. 19-22, 2026, and a special seat drop at the Iowa Renewable Fuels Summit in Altoona, Iowa, Feb. 5, 2026.

Don’t miss the chance to put your company and its offerings on full display for its target audience in the leading trade publication serving the biodiesel, renewable diesel, SAF and marine biofuel industries.

“If your company isn’t advertising with Biobased Diesel®, there is a good chance your competitors are,” Kotrba says.

Kotrba adds that 2026 is poised to be a potentially record-breaking year for the biobased diesel sector.

“I firmly believe 2026 will be a monumental year for biodiesel, renewable diesel, SAF and marine biofuel,” he says. “Industry advancements and capacity buildout—particularly for certain subsects of the broader biofuels industries—will continue globally driven by policy, corporate commitments to the environment and the urging of shareholders. In the U.S., EPA signaled earlier this year that it plans to unleash the American biobased diesel sector after years of lackluster volume requirements with its robust Renewable Fuel Standard proposal for 2026 and 2027.”

Furthermore, Kotrba says that with an extension of and significant revisions to the 45Z clean fuel production credit signed into law in July, along with the potential for full reallocation of recently waived RFS gallons from small-refinery exemptions (SREs), these three important pieces of the U.S. biofuel puzzle are falling into place. This is positioning the industries Biobased Diesel® serves to have a record year of production and project development.

“Lastly,” Kotrba says, “I would like to take this special opportunity to thank readers, subscribers, editorial contributors and advertisers for making Biobased Diesel Daily®, Biobased Diesel™ Weekly, and the Biobased Diesel® print journal a success over its five-year journey. I couldn’t have done this without you—thank you.”

For ship operators, these drop-in fuels could provide a cost-effective and lower-carbon alternative to traditional heavy fuel oil.

With higher energy density than many current biofuel alternatives, this renewable marine fuel can extend a vessel’s range without requiring costly engine upgrades, according to Honeywell.

The breakthrough comes at a time of impasse in shipping when it comes to cutting carbon intensity. This month the International Maritime Organization Marine Environment Protection Committee voted to delay the adoption of the industry’s planned Net Zero Framework.

Ken West, President of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, said, “The maritime industry has a real need for renewable fuels that are immediately available and cost effective. Our Biocrude Upgrading processing technology can be delivered in modular form, offering savings from the point of installation through to refining and use.”

The tech means plant and agricultural waste can be converted into lower carbon biocrude at the feedstock collection sites, which keeps transport costs low.

The process technology enables biocrude to then be refined at major facilities to produce marine fuel, gasoline or SAF. This helps solve long-standing challenges with converting biocrudes into fuels with performance comparable to conventional fuel.

Biocrude Upgrading process technology can be delivered in the form of a prefabricated modular plant.

The news also comes shortly after a report from the European Union Safety Agency warns of the challenges in scaling SAF, with supplies concentrated in a small number of member states, although it found production capacity assessments indicate the EU is on track to meet the overall mandatory SAF blending target (6%) in 2030.

While efficiency improvements and electrification will play a part, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) remains the only scalable option for deep decarbonisation of long-haul flights this side of 2040. As a ‘drop-in’ fuel that works with existing aircraft, it offers the most practical route to near-term emissions reduction.

At the same time, waste disposal continues to pose environmental and financial challenges for local authorities. Could these two problems help solve each other?

Download a copy of our full Waste-to-SAF Feasibility Study below or read on for a short summary.

Introducing the project

As part of the Heathrow Strategic Planning Group’s “Runway to Net Zero” programme, City Science led a high-level feasibility study exploring whether residual municipal solid waste from across Surrey and the wider Heathrow area could form the basis of a local SAF production system.

The study examined:

Residual waste volumes and composition

Potential SAF yields under different production pathways

Likely impacts of new policies, such as the inclusion of Energy from Waste in the UK Emissions Trading Scheme

Infrastructure requirements to support SAF production including land, water, energy, and waste logistics

It also compared the indicative carbon performance of a waste-to-SAF pathway against current waste disposal via Energy from Waste incineration.

What we found

Through discussions with industry experts, we established that locating a waste-to-SAF plant near Heathrow (rather than in an industrial cluster which has been the focus of developments so far), there are some substantial benefits to be gained, such as a high population density generating large amounts of waste in a relatively small radius, and a significant nearby offtake in Heathrow Airport.

A geospatial analysis conducted using City Science’s Cadence platform mapped key waste infrastructure and existing waste flow routes, helping partners understand both the practical opportunities and the transport feasibility of future supply chains.

City Science used Surrey as a test bed for our analysis, which produces around 185,000 tonnes of residual municipal waste per year. Within this, the SAF-relevant fraction (paper and card, wood, plastics and textiles) totalled approximately 63,000 tonnes.

Depending on conversion efficiency, this material could produce up to 20,000 tonnes of SAF – enough to power hundreds of long-haul flights from Heathrow, while cutting waste disposal emissions by over a third compared with Energy from Waste incineration.

The analysis also showed that a commercial-size SAF facility would need to draw waste from multiple neighbouring authorities to reach viable scale, making the case for regional collaboration across the Heathrow Strategic Planning Group (HSPG) area and beyond.

Conclusions

With Heathrow at the heart of one of the UK’s largest waste-producing regions, there is a unique opportunity to align aviation decarbonisation with local waste and energy planning. Waste-to-SAF offers a compelling alternative to conventional disposal routes such as incineration or landfill, with significant environmental benefits.

Looking Ahead

Through projects like Runway to Net Zero, we’re supporting regions to turn climate ambition into action, contributing to the UK’s drive to be a leader in clean aviation and to deliver on the Jet Zero Strategy.

Phase 2 of Runway to Net Zero has demonstrated the potential for Waste-to-SAF in the HSPG region, showing the need for a regionally coordinated approach to SAF development. Next steps to progress this work should focus on pathways to implementation, including a wider assessment of feedstock availability, identification of SAF production sites, and reviewing the economic case.

This equates to 10% of the world’s transport-related energy consumption and 3% of total global energy consumption (IEA, 2024a).
Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production is expected to reach 2.1 million litres in 2025, representing just 0.7% of total jet fuel production (IATA, 2024).
Growth in aviation emissions has been continuous, but it has been partially offset by substantial efficiency improvements.
In addition to carbon emissions, aviation contributes to climate change through the formation of contrails.","Aviation plays a vital role in connecting people, enabling global business, facilitating international trade and tourism, and providing a means of rapid transportation. The sector drives economic growth, shortens travel times and increases global interconnectedness.

One of the main challenges faced by aviation, however, is providing its social and economic benefits while also increasing its environmental responsibility. As one of the most carbon-intensive transport modes, aviation is a significant contributor to global GHG emissions and climate change (DESNZ and BEIZ, 2022). The sector is also responsible for non CO2 emissions (i.e. other gases and aerosol particles) that affect both the atmospheric composition and cloudiness, adding to the impact of the sector’s CO2 emissions (Lee, 2018).

In recent decades, demand for aviation services has steadily grown and could double by 2050 compared with 2022 levels (Graver, 2022; IATA, 2023). Therefore, there is a need to rapidly deploy decarbonisation solutions.

Emissions and energy use

In 2023, the energy consumption of the global aviation sector reached 13 EJ. This equates to 10% of the world’s transport-related energy consumption and 3% of total global energy consumption (IEA, 2024a). This energy demand was met nearly exclusively by fossil fuels. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production is expected to reach 2.1 million litres in 2025, representing just 0.7% of total jet fuel production (IATA, 2024).

Dependency on fossil fuels results in aviation contributing significantly to the world’s CO2 emissions and climate change. CO2 emissions from aviation in 2022 reached 0.9 Gt, equivalent to between 2% and 3% of global emissions and 11% of all transport-related emissions (IEA, 2023a). Growth in aviation emissions has been continuous, but it has been partially offset by substantial efficiency improvements. As shown in Figure 10, these improvements have resulted in as much as 11 GtCO2 in emission reductions since 1990 (ATAG, 2021). In addition to carbon emissions, aviation contributes to climate change through the formation of contrails.

Due to the mass and volume limitations of aircraft, aviation depends on highly energy-dense fuels. There are sustainable fuel alternatives, but these come with a cost premium. The limited choice of usable fuels and the immaturity of alternative aircraft technologies, such as electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft, therefore limit the decarbonisation pathways available to the sector.

Decarbonisation pathways

One decarbonisation pathway for aviation is the continued deployment of technological and operational energy efficiency improvements. Although the aviation sector has made significant progress in deploying increasingly efficient airframes and engines, there is still potential for further improvement. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) long-term aspirational goal aims for a 2% increase in fuel efficiency annually until 2050. This is higher than the average historically observed, and other projected, improvements of just 1.5% per year (ICAO, 2022a).

According to IRENA’s 1.5°C scenario, demand reduction and energy efficiency improvement are an important part of the sector’s decarbonisation efforts. These measures could account for roughly half of the sector’s emission reductions by 2050 13 (IRENA, 2023c). Further reductions could come from modal shifts in short-distance air travel – for example, replacing short flights with trains, which are much less carbon intensive (European Environment Agency, 2023).

The most technologically straightforward pathway to decarbonise the sector, however, is the use of advanced biofuels, namely biojet, given the maturity of the technology. Biojet can be used as a drop-in fuel on existing and future aircraft, making it a practical and immediately implementable option. Long-term bioenergy potential is not a constraint for the transition of the sector, either. IRENA suggests that the global technical potential for sustainable advanced biofuels is at least 114 EJ (IRENA, 2016b) or roughly eight times the energy demand for aviation. Current global biofuel production is only around 4.5 EJ, however, and is mostly food and feed crop based (90%) and used mainly for road transport (OECD/FAO, 2023).

The main challenges with biofuel are, first, its higher cost compared with conventional jet fuel and, second, the need to scale up its supply sustainably. Indeed, the rapid scale-up of sustainable biomass is complex and cannot be achieved without careful consideration of its potential negative impacts, particularly in terms of land use change and life-cycle GHG emissions. Minimizing these impacts requires strict controls along the entire supply chain, robust certification mechanisms and substantial policy interventions in the agriculture sector. At the same time, the increasing electrification of road transport could allow biofuel production capacity to be redirected towards other sectors, such as aviation and shipping.

Another option is the adoption of synthetic fuels produced from green hydrogen, which is produced from electrolysed water using renewable electricity. This can then be combined with a renewable source of carbon to produce a hydrocarbon fuel. The two options currently being considered are green hydrogen and e-kerosene. Although hydrogen could eliminate exhaust emissions from aviation, hydrogen aircraft technology for large passenger or cargo transport does not exist yet. This technology is also not expected to reach commercial maturity within a time frame compatible with making a material impact on carbon neutrality by mid-century. A fundamental issue revolves around the low volumetric energy density of hydrogen, which would require a fundamental redesign of airframes as well as operational procedures and safety standards. Furthermore, there is no hydrogen refuelling infrastructure in place.

E-kerosene, on the other hand, is chemically identical to its fossil counterpart and could be used in existing aircraft. The use of e-kerosene opens the door for deep emission reductions. However, the fact that the e-kerosene molecule contains carbon adds a layer of complexity. For e-kerosene to be an effective decarbonisation solution, it would have to be low carbon, and this carbon would need to come from a sustainable source (i.e. from biogenic sources such as bioenergy with CO2 capture or captured directly from the atmosphere). The need to build a sustainable supply chain for carbon is a major challenge, particularly given that to achieve cost efficiency, cheap renewable electricity for hydrogen production and a sustainable (and scalable) carbon source would need to be available.

However, if these challenges can be met, biofuels and e-fuels could account for the remaining half of the CO2 reductions needed by 2050, under IRENA’s 1.5°C scenario.

Electric propulsion is another technology pathway that should be considered for aviation. In the past, this has had limited potential as a decarbonisation solution due to the limited energy density of commercially available batteries. However, there has been remarkable progress in battery technologies over the last few years. Breakthroughs in energy density, with some batteries reaching 500 Wh/kg, could open the door the application of such batteries in electric or hybrid small aircraft and short-haul flights (CATL, 2023).

Electric propulsion also offers potential advantages over jet engines in areas such as higher efficiency, lower mechanical complexity and maintenance costs. Yet this pathway is not without its challenges. These challenges include the need to develop and certify new aircraft concepts and the need for further research and development in battery technologies to make them viable for flight as well as ground operations. These challenges also limit the decarbonisation potential of this technological pathway, given that new aircraft concepts can take as long as a decade to be developed and certified (FAA, 2023).",,N,,2025-10-29 13:57:23.936626

Economic growth and air freight capacity The government's support for expansion projects at Heathrow and Gatwick is rooted in a strategy for economic growth.
""Over 60% of UK air freight comes through Heathrow.
The committee doubts this approach, noting that SAF is not produced at a commercial scale large enough to offset emissions from airport expansion.
This policy lag creates uncertainty for businesses that depend on air freight and long-term infrastructure planning.","The approved expansion of the UK's primary air freight hubs could jeopardise the nation's net-zero commitments, a cross-party committee of MPs has warned.

The government has been urged to clarify how it will mitigate the environmental impact of new runways at Heathrow and Gatwick airports before construction begins.

A report from the Commons Environmental Audit Committee suggests current policies are not sufficient to reduce carbon emissions from aviation in line with legal targets, particularly as demand for air travel and freight is projected to increase.

This situation creates a conflict between bolstering the UK's supply chain infrastructure and adhering to climate change targets.

Economic growth and air freight capacity

The government's support for expansion projects at Heathrow and Gatwick is rooted in a strategy for economic growth.

Since the 2024 general election, Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves have endorsed the new runways.

The Chancellor explains the strategic importance of Heathrow, stating: ""It connects us to emerging markets all over the world, opening up new opportunities for growth. Around three quarters of all long haul flights go from Heathrow.

""Over 60% of UK air freight comes through Heathrow. And about 15 million business travellers use Heathrow in 2023.”

However, the committee's report challenges this economic-first approach.

""The government has not demonstrated that the economic growth from airport expansion provides enough benefit to outweigh the negative climate and environmental impacts it will lead to,"" the report states.

The critique highlights a central tension for supply chain leaders: while expanded airport capacity could mean more efficient logistics, the associated environmental costs and regulatory risks are significant.

John McDonnell, Labour’s MP for Hayes and Harlington, commented on the Heathrow expansion, calling it a “huge political, economic and especially environmental mistake”.

Sustainable aviation fuel and logistical hurdles

The government's ""jet zero"" strategy for greener aviation relies heavily on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The committee doubts this approach, noting that SAF is not produced at a commercial scale large enough to offset emissions from airport expansion.

These concerns are highlighted by real-world examples, such as Air New Zealand's decision last year to abandon its 2030 decarbonisation target due to difficulties in procuring SAF.

It demonstrates the challenges faced by the global aviation sector in securing a stable and affordable supply of alternative fuels, a critical factor for the long-term sustainability of supply chains.

Outdated policy and investment uncertainty

The expansion projects are set to proceed before the government updates its airports national policy statement, which dates back to 2018.

The committee argues this allows the government to avoid proper scrutiny and base decisions on a framework that is not aligned with current climate objectives.

This policy lag creates uncertainty for businesses that depend on air freight and long-term infrastructure planning.

Toby Perkins, the Labour Chair of the committee, warns that decarbonisation already represents a challenge.

""Expanding airport capacity is likely to make that task much harder,"" Toby says. ""Under the government's existing 'jet zero' strategy, expanding airport capacity is likely to put net zero at serious risk.""

Alethea Warrington, Head of Aviation at climate charity Possible, describes the report as the ""final nail in the coffin"" for the government's case.

She says: ""The government's scrutiny committee has made it clearer than ever that airport growth is a bad option for Britain, and that the government simply doesn't have any economic evidence to justify the environmental devastation this would cause.""",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/10f3a912f5b872a0930165add8b4405b:04c0090e6985de475def6ea019635a21/gettyimages-2197839670.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 12:00:17.188446

Running from 17 to 21 November at Dubai World Central, the 19th edition will gather airports, OEMs, regulators, operators and energy partners to accelerate adoption of cleaner technology.

Dubai Airports, Airbus, Boeing, the World Economic Forum, Airports Council International and the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority are among the confirmed participants.

Dubai Airports’ Director of Sustainability, Sven Deckers, said the industry has entered a delivery rather than a planning phase, noting that sustainability is “no longer about future ambition, it is a current necessity” and that the Airshow provides the right forum to turn shared goals into action.

Real-world green operations

A new feature will spotlight how lower-carbon aircraft turnaround can work in practice. The oneDXB Sustainability Alliance, led by Dubai Airports with dnata, flydubai and service providers, will run live demonstrations showing near-term solutions for greener ground operations at DXB and DWC.

This guided tour presents equipment and processes expected to be on their way into the market, showing a step-by-step approach to cutting emissions on the apron through joint industry action, rather than isolated initiatives.

SAF and cleaner show operations

Sustainable aviation fuel will once again be available for aircraft taking part in flying and static displays, supplied in partnership with Jetex, the same company, which began offering SAF to private aviation customers in the UAE in 2023.

Chief Executive Adel Mardini noted, that supplying SAF at the Airshow forms part of a collective industry effort to decarbonise aviation, and that strategy stems on reducing emissions through practical adoption of cleaner energy sources.

Show operations are also being adapted. Electric and propane-powered ground support equipment will be used across the site to limit emissions generated during the show’s peformances.

Expanded sustainability conference

The Airshow’s sustainability conference has been extended to two days and will cover topics including SAF scale-up, next-generation fuels, airport decarbonisation, green finance and technology investment.

Confirmed speakers include ACI World Director General Justin Erbacci, GACA Executive Vice President for Aviation Safety and Environmental Sustainability Captain Sulaiman Almuhaimedi, and Dubai Airports’ Sven Deckers.

Airbus said it views the show as an important platform to advance joint pathways, with the company’s Head of Sustainable Aviation Fuels and Carbon Dioxide Removal, Julien Manhes, emphasising the value of partnerships in accelerating the industry’s transition.

Boeing repeats this stance. Jeff Shockey, the company’s Executive Vice President for Government Operations, Public Policy and Corporate Strategy, said Dubai Airshow 2025 comes at a time of progress for the sector in the region, and that Boeing remains focused on commercially viable solutions that support sustainable aviation growth.

Greener exhibition model

Sustainability efforts will extend well beyond the runway and show floor. This year’s edition is set to overhaul how major trade events operate in Dubai, with organisers pushing to make the Airshow itself a working model for lower-impact exhibitions.

The Better Stands Programme returns with a stronger mandate for reusable and modular builds, aiming to reduce single-use construction materials that typically end up in landfill after large events.

Exhibition halls, chalets and feature zones will run on 100% renewable electricity and prioritise recycled or reusable materials throughout.

Operational changes are also being scaled up. Solar-powered maintenance cabins will rise by 50% compared with the last edition, and visitors will be offered lower-emission transport options across the city to reduce event-related travel emissions.

Finally, even attendee habits are being targeted. Airbus-backed hydration stations from Bluewater-Nia will remove single-use plastic bottles from the venue, while Rove Hotels steps in as official partner with LEED Gold-certified accommodation.

The 42nd International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly closed on October 3, 2025.

In the fragmented, competitive world of aviation, the race to harmonize global sustainability policies has never been more vital.

The international aviation community is flying through heavy crosswinds, but its flight path to net zero, for the moment, seems to remain unaltered.

The 42nd International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly closed on October 3, 2025, in Montreal.

During these triennial assemblies, delegations from up to 193 states convene to review and set ICAO priorities, budget and goals. This year’s Assembly has been particularly closely watched as it was the first meeting after the previous Assembly’s landmark commitment for international aviation to achieve net zero by 2050.

During the preceding General Assembly in 2022, ICAO had agreed on a Long-Term Aspirational Goal (LTAG) to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It also consolidated the implementation of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) as the first global sectoral market-based scheme for international aviation, which has seen the pool of voluntary states’ participation increase from 88 in 2021 to 130 today.

With a shifting geopolitical context that has been de-prioritizing climate policies, concerns that international sustainable aviation ambitions might be toned down were legitimate. This triennial Assembly, however, demonstrated a global consensus on environmental topics and succeeded in reaffirming the commitment of ICAO Member States to the LTAG.

Non-sustainability items were also the Assembly’s core focus. To address emerging risks, such as recent air transport incidents, increased geopolitical tensions and armed conflicts, and the multiplication of new forms of cybersecurity threats, ICAO states committed to enhancing the global safety and security framework for aviation, in line with ICAO’s long-term aspiration of zero fatalities worldwide.

What was agreed on sustainable air transportation during this Assembly?

Following the adoption of the LTAG, the efforts of ICAO over the last three years have been focused on the implementation of pragmatic measures to achieve this goal. These include:

The adoption of new carbon emissions and noise stringent standards for new aircraft type designs and in-production aircraft types.

The adoption of a robust monitoring and reporting methodology to track progress towards the LTAG (LTAG Monitoring and Reporting Methodology).

The Endorsement of the ICAO Global Framework for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), Lower Carbon Aviation Fuels (LCAF) and other Aviation Cleaner Energies, ICAO’s plan to achieve a 5% CO2 emissions reduction in international aviation by 2030 on the path towards this net-zero aspirational goal by 2050.

Support for accelerated investment in clean technology solutions through the operationalization of ICAO’s Finvest Hub, a platform that connects project developers, financiers and government institutions to bridge the gap between aviation decarbonization projects and the required capital to deploy them, with a specific focus on SAF.

The renewed commitment to the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), the world’s only global market-based measure for international aviation.

The extension of the ICAO ACT-SAF (its capability building programme to support countries as they explore SAF) to an ACT-LTAG programme, aimed at providing assistance and implementation support for all emissions reduction measures (including operational and infrastructural measures).

The emphasized attention to climate change adaptation and resilience with support to further action on adaptation.

What is the World Economic Forum doing to reduce aviation's carbon footprint?

As other sectors proceed to decarbonize, the aviation sector could account for a much higher share of global greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century than its 2%-3% share today.

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) can reduce the life-cycle carbon footprint of aviation fuel by up to 80%, but they currently make up less than 0.1% of total aviation fuel consumption. Enabling a shift from fossil fuels to SAFs will require a significant increase in production, which is a costly investment.

The Forum’s Clean Skies for Tomorrow (CST) Coalition is a global initiative driving the transition to sustainable aviation fuels as part of the aviation industry’s ambitious efforts to achieve carbon-neutral flying.

Loading...

The coalition brings together government leaders, climate experts and CEOs from aviation, energy, finance and other sectors who agree on the urgent need to help the aviation industry reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The coalition aims to advance the commercial scale of viable production of sustainable low-carbon aviation fuels (bio and synthetic) for broad adoption in the industry by 2030. Initiatives include a mechanism for aggregating demand for carbon-neutral flying, a co-investment vehicle and geographically specific value-chain industry blueprints.

The Airports of Tomorrow’s priorities were also heard

Airports Council International (ACI) World played a central role in ensuring that airports’ perspectives were fully represented in discussions shaping the future of global aviation, from air connectivity and passenger experience issues, to energy transition and sustainable economic growth. ACI World notably called on states to ensure that airports have access to sufficient reliable, renewable and affordable energy supplies. This appeal underscored the importance of coordinated national policies to help airports meet rising energy needs, while achieving long-term decarbonization targets. As aviation strives towards net-zero goals, ensuring airports can source renewable power is fundamental to maintaining resilient, efficient and sustainable operations.

Concretely, what does that mean for global aviation decarbonization ambitions?

No backtracking on current ambitions can already be considered as a positive message. Additionally, this assembly succeeded in endorsing ambitious progress to continue implementing the measures that will decarbonize the aviation sector.

The implementation of the Global Framework will be key for the future of sustainable fuels, by providing long-term, stable support to attract the necessary investments and demand needed to get them to scale.

On the back of this unaltered commitment, an increasing number of environmentally ambitious regions will likely continue to pursue and adopt decarbonization policies. This alignment is essential to avoid a global patchwork of varying sustainability ambitions.

Europe: Currently leading the way on aviation climate policies, developments on CORSIA – and whether EU legislators will judge it ambitious enough – will impact the upcoming review of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). This might broaden the number of routes subject to carbon pricing, while transportation modes battle each other over which will draw the most support out of the upcoming Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP).

US: On the other side of the Atlantic, betting on incentives, rather than mandates, the US has instead relaxed some of its SAF feedstock sustainability criteria through the One Big Beautiful Act, opening the door to cheaper, but also less environmentally beneficial, fuel pathways.

Asia-Pacific (APAC): SAF policies are ramping up across several APAC countries (e.g, Singapore’s SAF levy, Australia’s Cleaner Fuels Programme unleashing $1.1 billion in incentives, mandates in Japan, Malaysia, Thailand etc.), though at a slower pace than in Europe, at least at this stage, and with less stringent approaches to feedstock sustainability criteria.

In such a fragmented world of aviation decarbonization policies and a fiercer than ever competitive environment, the race to harmonize global sustainability policies has never felt more essential.

Within an increasingly shifting and unstable geopolitical environment, the international aviation community is increasingly flying through heavy crosswinds, but its flight path to net zero for the moment seems to have remained unaltered.

The process generates lower-carbon marine fuel, gasoline, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from low-cost, widely available biomass such as crop residues and wood chips, according to the press release.

For ship operators, these “drop-in” fuels offer a cost-efficient, lower-carbon alternative to traditional heavy fuel oil. With a higher energy density than many existing biofuels, the renewable marine fuel can extend a vessel’s operational range without the need for expensive engine modifications.

“Honeywell continues to innovate in areas where our customers need solutions most,” said Ken West, president of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions. “The maritime sector requires renewable fuels that are both readily available and affordable. Our Biocrude Upgrading technology can be deployed in modular form, delivering savings from installation through refining and end use.”

The technology allows plant and agricultural waste to be converted into lower-carbon biocrude at feedstock collection sites, minimizing transport costs. This biocrude can then be refined at major facilities to produce marine fuel, gasoline, or SAF, overcoming long-standing challenges in achieving fuel performance comparable to conventional products.

Honeywell’s Biocrude Upgrading process can be implemented as a prefabricated modular plant, helping customers reduce risk and speed up project timelines by simplifying construction.

The launch comes as shipping companies face growing pressure from both regulations and customers to cut carbon emissions. Since the 1960s, the maritime sector has primarily relied on heavy fuel oil—a byproduct of refining gasoline, diesel, and kerosene—which accounts for roughly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Honeywell.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 10:00:37.359604

The industry group recently submitted a letter to members of the European Commission arguing that this targeted mechanism is crucial for de-risking investments and accelerating the production of Europe’s most sustainable drop-in aviation fuel.

Background: SASHA and the STIP

The need for this intervention arises from the EU’s overarching goals to decarbonize transport, particularly aviation and maritime sectors, which are hard-to-electrify.

The SASHA Coalition (Skies and Seas Hydrogen-fuels Accelerator Coalition) is an alliance bringing together leading companies across the green shipping and aviation ecosystems. The Coalition advocates for EU and UK policies that support the development and commercialization of sustainable green hydrogen energy solutions. SASHA’s research indicates that green hydrogen is essential for all pathways to truly sustainable fuels in these sectors.

The target of SASHA’s lobbying effort, the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), is expected to be a major pillar of the Clean Industrial Deal, announced in the first half of 2025. The STIP aims to scale and prioritize investments for decarbonizing all EU transport modes. Expected for publication in late 2025, the plan will focus on reducing risks for private investments in renewable and low-carbon fuels and enhancing the EU’s strategic autonomy.

EU Advocacy Manager at the SASHA Coalition, Delphine Kaczorowski, summarized the impact of the STIP by saying:

“The STIP could mark a watershed moment for European clean flight innovation, but only if it targets the most promising solutions including e-kerosene, the most sustainable and scalable drop-in alternative fuel. A book-and-claim system could be a crucial tool for unlocking clean competitive aviation, but including all alternative fuels would dilute impact and divert incentives to biofuels that are less sustainable, less competitive at scale, and less in need of support.

When strategically limited to e-kerosene, book-and-claim can help Europe’s boldest clean aviation innovators overcome the market failures holding them back.”

Book-and-Claim: Unlocking the E-SAF Market

E-kerosene, or synthetic aviation fuel (e-SAF), produced using renewable hydrogen, is recognized as the most scalable and sustainable alternative drop-in jet fuel. Despite Europe holding over half of the global production capacity for this fuel, producers are struggling to secure the final investment decisions (FID) needed to scale up.

This difficulty is exacerbated by high capital costs and a geographical mismatch: producers are often located where renewable energy capacity is abundant, while early buyers are concentrated in larger aviation hubs.

A well-regulated book-and-claim system provides a solution by allowing the physical e-SAF to be sold to one buyer and its certified green attributes (or credentials) to be sold separately to another buyer.

The SASHA Coalition highlights several ways a well-regulated B&C system would improve the European e-SAF market:

De-risking Investment: By widening the pool of viable buyers and allowing producers to overcome geographical restrictions, B&C helps achieve revenue stability, thereby lowering the risk premium on investment and giving investors the financial certainty needed to reach FID.

Increased Market Access and Reduced Costs: Separating the physical fuel from its sustainability characteristics expands market access for producers and reduces the costs and carbon emissions associated with transporting the physical e-SAF over long distances.

Regulatory Compliance: For aircraft operators (offtakers), B&C would increase the pool of e-SAF producers available to them, making compliance with ReFuelEU Aviation targets easier.

Strategic Limitations to Prevent Dilution

In July of this year, the SASHA Coalition emphasized that B&C is not a “silver bullet” but a transformative complement to other revenue certainty mechanisms like Contracts for Difference (CfD). Crucially, the system must be strictly regulated to ensure it drives Europe’s Clean Industrial Deal goals and supports the nascent e-kerosene industry rather than unintentionally boosting less sustainable alternatives.

Accordingly, the letter outlines three necessary criteria for the B&C system:

Exclusively for E-kerosene/E-SAF: This targets support toward the most sustainable but least mature alternative drop-in fuel, ensuring impact is not diluted and incentives are not diverted toward more easily available biofuels. Biofuels are currently more competitive and require less de-risking support than e-SAF.

Operates Only Within the EEA: Limiting the scope to the European Economic Area concentrates competitiveness gains and industrial innovation among European producers, supporting long-term energy security.

Timebound with an End-Date: A fixed end date is necessary to ensure market actors remain incentivized to invest in the physical supply chain infrastructure needed for long-term distributed access to e-SAF across the EU.

The Non-CO2 Climate Impact

While the primary focus of e-SAF adoption is the reduction of CO2 emissions, the broader transition to clean technologies in aviation holds additional environmental benefits. The STIP is encouraged to support the development and adoption of zero-carbon emission technologies by investing in hydrogen infrastructure in airports and green Public Service Obligation (PSO) routes. Investment in alternative propulsion systems, such as electric or hydrogen fuel cell-powered aircraft, is essential because these technologies offer the additional benefit of mitigating both CO2 and non-CO2 climate impacts. This focus aligns with the objective to clean up and modernize transport to meet future environmental demands.

A new study by two economists, commissioned by green group T&E, shows that aviation demand depends mostly on airline strategy and market trends, such as changed travel behaviour. This refutes airlines’ claims that national aviation taxes and fees are solely responsible for driving passengers away, says T&E.

The study looks at the relationship between location-based costs and passenger volumes for 101 European airports in 2024 [1]. Findings show that airports with low costs do not guarantee higher passenger numbers. In fact, airports with higher costs tend to have more passengers. Heathrow Airport for example has the highest location-based costs but also the highest passenger numbers in Europe. Consequently, the study finds there is only a weak correlation between costs and passenger numbers in this order of magnitude of taxation [2]. This is also shown by a further analysis of the relationship between changes in ticket prices and changes in passenger numbers to date, which again only found a weak correlation. Hubs, international agreements, and market strategies are more likely to determine whether an airport is important and being served.

Marte van der Graaf, aviation officer at T&E, says: “Airlines are trying to tell an easy story by blaming location costs for decreased demand. But this is just a campaign to cut taxes and fees. Demand for flying is not such a simple numbers game. In reality, strategic decisions by airlines, trends in travel behaviour, and airline business models influence passenger numbers, rather than costs alone.”

Historically, increased prices in air travel have not curbed demand. In Germany, for example, the 2019 jet fuel price was twice as high as in 2000, but in the same period passenger numbers grew by 75%. Demand in aviation is instead mainly determined by supply. Airlines set their flight schedules months in advance and then fill seats by adjusting prices. Associated costs like hotel expenses could also affect demand, the study suggests.

Reduced passenger demand could also be linked to the global decline in business travel after the COVID pandemic. T&E's Travel Smart Campaign finds that business travel by the world’s biggest companies fell by 34% between 2019 and 2023. Meanwhile, leisure travel is growing in dominance. While business travellers usually fly to economic centres, leisure travel is concentrated towards holiday destinations, increasing air travel to southern European countries by 10 to 20% in 2025, compared to 2019. Overall, trends in travel behavior tend to have a greater impact on passenger demand than taxation and other costs.

T&E recommends national governments not to cap or reduce levies. Cutting aviation taxes, fees and charges would mean throwing away billions in public revenues without a tangible effect on passenger numbers. National ticket taxes should be designed to reflect economic externalities, i.e. the most climate-damaging tickets should have the highest taxes. This means higher tax rates for first and business class tickets and higher tax rates for long haul flights.

“Airlines tirelessly blame levies for their billion-dollar business not doing as well as usual. If taxes and fees were lowered now, it would simply be a gift to the airlines, while emptying national budgets from much needed money. The revenue from fair taxation could be invested in sustainable aviation fuel.”, concludes van der Graaf.

[1] The study by economists Prof. Friedrich Thießen and Prof. Christoph Brützel analyzed costs for airports arising from national levies and compared the number of passengers traveling to and from these airports. It was factored in if the airport type changes results. Also, it was verified that a traditional price elasticity analysis is not reliable in aviation. The study amplifies a DLR study from April 2025.

[2] With proper taxation, which would imply another order of magnitude of cost increases, aviation taxation could become a demand management tool. But current minor variations in national taxes, charges and fees do not show a strong correlation with demand.",https://www.transportenvironment.org/uploads/images/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/Plane.png?mtime=1714398694,N,,2025-10-29 04:01:02.505363

With air traffic almost back to pre-COVID levels, aviation could account for up to 20% of global emissions by 2050 without stronger decarbonisation measures.

Recognising this challenge, the commercial aviation sector has committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050. To get there, the industry must scale low-carbon fuels alongside efficiency improvements in aircraft and operations. Among these solutions, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has emerged as one of the most immediate and scalable pathways to cut emissions from air travel.

This guide unpacks what sustainable aviation fuel is, how it reduces emissions, and where agriculture fits in — as both a source of renewable feedstocks and a driver of regional opportunity.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel, produced from non-fossil sources such as:

Oilseeds (e.g., canola, soybeans, sunflower, safflower)

Agricultural residues (e.g., sugarcane trash, stubble)

Dedicated energy crops (e.g., pongamia)

Waste products (e.g., tallow, used cooking oils)

READ MORE: Get on board: Experts urge Australia to prepare for sustainable aviation fuel take-off

Chemically, SAF is almost identical to conventional jet fuel, meaning it can be a drop-in replacement that works with existing aircraft engines and infrastructure. It can also be mixed in with conventional jet fuel with no impact on performance, with the current regulations allowing for up to a 50% blend.

What makes SAF sustainable is its feedstock origin. Instead of drawing carbon from underground fossil reserves, it relies on biogenic carbon (carbon already cycling through plants, residues, or waste streams.) By turning agricultural by-products or renewable crops into fuel, SAF links aviation to the circular bioeconomy: keeping carbon in motion rather than adding new emissions to the atmosphere.

How does Sustainable Aviation Fuel reduce emissions?

SAF lowers aviation emissions across its entire lifecycle, not just at the point of combustion. Lifecycle assessments show it can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, depending on feedstock and production pathway.

The key difference lies in its carbon cycle. Fossil fuels release carbon that has been locked underground for millions of years, adding new CO₂ to the atmosphere. SAF reuses carbon already cycling through the biosphere, absorbed by plants during growth.

While most of SAF’s emission savings occur during the feedstock phase, additional reductions come from:

Cleaner production pathways: Renewable conversion technologies (such as HEFA, Fischer–Tropsch, and Alcohol-to-Jet) consume less energy than petroleum refining, lowering upstream emissions.

Avoiding methane emissions from decomposing organic waste.

Integrating feedstock systems with regenerative agriculture: improving soil carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling, while linking aviation to broader decarbonisation goals.

By combining lifecycle emissions savings with the practical advantage of drop-in fuel, SAF offers a scalable near-term solution that connects agriculture, innovation, and aviation in a single circular system.

Agricultural feedstocks: A new opportunity for farmers?

As demand for renewable aviation fuel grows, agriculture is emerging as a critical enabler. Many SAF pathways rely on bio-based feedstocks, creating new markets for underutilised or undervalued materials produced on farms.

Potential agricultural feedstocks include:

Crop and forestry residues such as stubble, husks, and straw

Waste oils and fats from food processing or livestock rendering

Energy crops like pongamia that can grow on marginal land.

For farmers, this shift opens diversification opportunities, turning waste into value through a new bio-industrial supply chain. In Australia, emerging projects such as Jet Zero’s ‘Regions to the Runway’ are exploring SAF potential through integrated feedstock supply, regional biorefineries, and logistics networks, with the end goal of positioning our country for domestic fuel security and export advantage.

Benefits of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Climate and emissions reduction

SAF represents one of the most practical near-term pathways for decarbonising long-haul aviation. Each litre of SAF used directly displaces fossil jet fuel, reducing net CO₂ emissions and helping airlines meet their net zero targets and commitments.

Diversification for rural economies

Developing SAF supply chains can stimulate regional industries, from feedstock aggregation and pre-processing to biorefining and logistics. This diversification offers new income streams, creates jobs and strengthens community resilience – and fosters collaboration between the agriculture and energy sectors.

Compatibility with existing infrastructure

Because SAF can be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel, it integrates seamlessly into today’s fuel systems and aircraft. This drop-in capability gives it a major advantage over alternative technologies that require entirely new engines or refuelling infrastructure.

Challenges and limitations of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

SAF faces several challenges on the route to reaching its potential:

Cost: SAF is currently two to five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, due largely to the limited availability of sustainable feedstocks, the continuing development of new production technologies, and limited commercial-scale production capacity

Feedstock competition: SAF must deliver around two thirds of the sector’s emissions reductions if it is to reach net zero by 2050. That requires production of around 450 billion litres per year. In 2025, it is expected to reach 2.1 billion litres – just 0.5% of the volume needed by 2050. But scaling production could increase pressure on land and water resources, unless waste and residue-based sources are prioritised.

Scaling uptake: SAF production currently represents less than 0.1% of global aviation fuel use.

Policy uncertainty: Long-term investment depends on stable policy, certification frameworks, clear sustainability criteria, and incentives to de-risk capital flows into new biorefineries.

These challenges underscore the importance of continued innovation in both feedstock supply and fuel conversion technologies – areas where agrifood research and collaboration can deliver transformative breakthroughs.

Powering cleaner skies with agriculture in the driving seat

The transition to sustainable aviation fuel is not just about cleaner energy – it’s about rethinking where that energy comes from.

Renewable diesel and other biofuels production capacity increased just 391 million gallons per year (gal/y) in 2024, less than one-third of the growth observed in 2022 and 2023. In 2024, only two capacity additions came online, both in California: Phillips 66’s conversion of its Rodeo refinery to exclusively produce biofuels and the new Renewable Fuels LLC plant in Bakersfield.

With the completed conversion, the Rodeo plant has a capacity of 767 million gal/y, up from 180 million gal/y in last year’s report. This increase makes it the second-largest renewable diesel plant in the United States, behind Diamond Green Diesel’s 982-million-gal/y plant in Norco, Louisiana.

U.S. capacity growth from the Rodeo expansion and the 138-million-gal/y Bakersfield plant was partially offset by the loss of capacity at four facilities. Monroe Energy and Chevron stopped co-processing renewable diesel at their Trainer, Pennsylvania, and El Segundo, California, refineries, respectively. Vertex Energy and Jaxon Energy closed plants in Mobile, Alabama, and Jackson, Mississippi, respectively.

The loss of renewable diesel capacity at four facilities reflects changes to biofuel margins and petroleum refining margins since 2020. Low refinery margins and rising biofuel credit values in 2020 and 2021 prompted a wave of renewable diesel capacity announcements. As more of those plants started operations, biofuel production began exceeding target volumes, and biofuel credit values and margins decreased in 2023. At the same time, petroleum refinery margins were much stronger than their 2020 lows, resulting in a slowdown in investments to expand renewable diesel capacity for the upcoming years.

A notable shift in 2024 was the increased focus on SAF. SAF is an alternative to petroleum jet fuel that we capture in our other biofuels category. Other biofuels includes SAF, renewable heating oil, renewable naphtha, renewable propane, renewable gasoline, and other emerging biofuels. We combine other biofuels with renewable diesel capacity because other biofuels are mostly produced at renewable diesel plants as byproducts or, often in the case of SAF, in place of renewable diesel. Following the completion of conversion projects in 2024, Phillips 66’s Rodeo plant can shift about 150 million gal/y of its renewable diesel production capacity to SAF, and Diamond Green Diesel can shift about 235 million gal/y to SAF.

Biodiesel

In addition to slower growth in renewable diesel production capacity, biodiesel production capacity decreased slightly. In 2024, eight biodiesel plants closed due to poor margins, resulting in a loss of about 100 million gal/y of production capacity.

Fuel ethanol

Unlike renewable diesel and biodiesel, U.S. fuel ethanol production capacity increased more in 2024 than in previous years. Fuel ethanol accounts for 73% of all biofuels production capacity, with a total of almost 18.5 billion gallons of capacity per year. Most of this production is concentrated in Midwest states, where corn is produced for feedstock. Because U.S. fuel ethanol consumption has been somewhat flat in recent years, the increased capacity is mostly contributing to growing exports of ethanol.",https://www.renewableenergymagazine.com/ficheroenergias/fotos/agenda/ampliada/b/biofuelchart.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 03:01:45.437270

Thailand’s first standard for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) specifications is expected to be released this month and enforced next year, starting at 1% and increasing to 8% by 2036. The move aims to decarbonize the aviation sector in line with international measures and support the country’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.

Industry and government align as Thailand prepares for SAF takeoff

As the SAF standard nears launch, the industry is gearing up to build a full supply chain, from raw materials to jet fuel. Thailand’s leading biofuel producer, Bangchak, inaugurated a dedicated facility for 100% neat SAF in April, with an initial production capacity of 1 million liters per day.

The company has signed agreements with local governments and food and beverage companies to collect used cooking oil as feedstock, while its subsidiary, BBGI (Bio-Based Green Innovation), is exploring algae-based SAF to diversify future sources.

PTT Global Chemical (PTTGC), the state-owned petroleum and LNG company, produced its first batch of SAF from used cooking oil in January and plans to expand production to 24 million litres per year in the future. The company has also formed strategic partnerships with Thai Airways and Bangkok Airways to collaborate on the research, development, and adoption of SAF.

Complementing these industry efforts, the Thai government has partnered with private and industrial sectors to strengthen the SAF supply chain. Six companies have joined the initiative, including Central Group, Thai Beverage, Charoen Pokphand Foods, Thai President Foods, the Thai Food Processors Association, and Bangchak Corporation.

Under the country’s Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP 2024), Thailand aims for 675 million liters of SAF consumption by 2037, equivalent to 1.85 million liters per day of neat SAF.

ASEAN joins the global push for SAF

The push for SAF is gaining momentum across ASEAN, with countries advancing at different stages of policy and market readiness. Singapore has emerged as the region’s frontrunner, combining clear policy targets with strategic industrial planning. On Oct. 14, the country passed the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (Amendment) Bill, paving the way for a green fuel levy on all departing passengers to ensure SAF makes up at least 1% of total jet fuel use by 2026.

Malaysia is another key player, leading the region with at least eight active projects in refinery construction and feedstock development. The country delivered its first locally blended SAF in September, marking the start of continuous, scalable production and targeting 1% SAF use by 2027.

Globally, the European Union has set one of the most ambitious benchmarks, mandating 6% SAF use by 2030 under the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative. Although SAF currently costs about three times more than fossil-based jet fuel, penalties for non-compliance are roughly three times the cost of compliance, according to an analysis by Carbon Direct, underscoring how seriously governments are enforcing these mandates.

SAF currently costs about three times more than conventional fossil-based jet fuel. (RFEUA: The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, CAF: conventional aviation fuel) (Chart: EU Aviation Safety Agency)

As global momentum for decarbonization builds, Thailand is positioning itself to stay on board the global SAF transition. The country has an abundance of raw materials suitable for SAF production, supporting the government’s ambition to establish Thailand as a regional aviation hub, said Sarawut Kaewtathip, director-general of the Department of Energy Business.

The counter rose as high as S$1.42 as at 9.02 am, having ended Tuesday S$0.02 down at S$1.32, as DBS analyst Jason Sum set a target price of S$1.75. It later pared some of the gains to be 4.5 per cent up as at 10.15 am.

Sum cited the normalisation of crude oil and jet fuel market structures, which is expected to lift trading profitability, as well as “persistent regional price differentials” that should continue to create arbitrage opportunities.

“Together, these trends underpin our earnings projections, which are 12 to 18 per cent above consensus,” he said in a note.

The target price is based on a 10.8 multiple of the 2026 earnings per share forecast, which represents one standard deviation above its historical average.

CAO’s profit contributions from its key associate, Shanghai Pudong International Airport Aviation Fuel Supply Corp (SPIA), are poised for a continued rebound as international air traffic in China continues to recover, said DBS.

SPIA is the sole supplier of jet fuel at Shanghai Pudong International Airport and is one-third owned by CAO.

Sum added that the group’s early strategic positioning in sustainable aviation fuel also provides “compelling medium-term growth optionality”.

“Most importantly, CAO’s substantial net cash balance and increasing imperative for capital discipline strongly position the company to significantly enhance shareholder returns through higher dividends,” said the analyst.

“Together, these factors underpin a multi-year high-single-digit earnings compound annual growth rate and valuation upside potential.”

CAO is 51 per cent controlled by state-owned National Aviation Fuel Group in China, which is the largest aviation transportation logistics service provider there. BP Investments Asia, a subsidiary of British Petroleum, holds a 20 per cent stake in CAO.

It is Asia-Pacific’s largest physical jet fuel buyer and in August posted a net profit of US$50 million for the first half of its financial year. This was an 18 per cent year-on-year increase from US$42.4 million in the year-ago period.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/70e8b2bd36ded9c15d6665444c140f04729d4a64845a098783fb5fc2b9e280bd?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-10-28 22:56:11.696261
