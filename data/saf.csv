Sustainable aviation initiatives not only reduce emissions but also enhance the appeal of these destinations as leaders in responsible tourism.
The combination of a flight levy, centralized fuel procurement, and regional collaboration offers a replicable model for sustainable air transport.","The global aviation sector is entering a new era of environmental accountability, and Singapore is taking a decisive step forward. In a landmark move, the nation has passed a parliamentary bill that imposes a fixed flight levy aimed at curbing carbon emissions and fostering the widespread use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This initiative places Singapore at the forefront of green aviation in Asia, setting a precedent for other nations seeking to balance air travel growth with environmental sustainability. The levy will be collected by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), which will utilize the funds to procure and manage SAF across airlines operating from the city-state.

With air travel rebounding strongly after the pandemic and climate change remaining a global concern, Singapore’s decision reflects a forward-thinking approach that blends economic resilience with ecological responsibility. The nation aims to increase SAF usage to more than 1% by 2026, with an ambitious plan to expand that figure to 3–5% by 2030. The initiative not only supports environmental goals but also reassures travelers that sustainable flying can remain affordable and accessible.

Singapore’s Flight Levy: A Step Toward Sustainable Air Travel

Under the newly approved policy, every departing flight from Singapore will include a fixed levy collected by CAAS. The funds will directly support the procurement and management of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, ensuring that airlines contribute to emission reduction efforts. According to Singapore’s Senior Minister of State for Transport Sun Xueling, this centralized approach will enable the government to manage resources efficiently and negotiate better terms with global suppliers of SAF.

This model marks a shift from the traditional airline-by-airline procurement of fuel toward a unified, government-led strategy. The goal is to aggregate SAF demand across carriers, which would help achieve economies of scale and stabilize prices in a market where sustainable fuel production remains limited and costly.

By ensuring consistent SAF availability, Singapore is also positioning itself as a strategic hub for green aviation in the Asia-Pacific region — a move that complements its reputation as a global air transport center and tourism gateway.

The Cost Impact: Shared Responsibility for a Greener Future

Concerns often arise when new environmental levies are introduced, particularly regarding potential fare hikes. However, Singaporean authorities have clarified that the new levy will not cause a significant increase in airfares. The additional cost will be modest — approximately S$3 (US$2.30) per passenger for an economy-class direct flight, depending on the travel distance.

Rather than placing the entire burden on airlines or passengers, the initiative distributes the cost evenly across all air transport users. This balanced model reflects a principle of shared responsibility, encouraging travelers, operators, and policymakers to work collectively toward achieving a carbon-neutral aviation sector.

The modest increase is a small price to pay for a cleaner sky and a more sustainable future. For eco-conscious travelers, it also offers an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to environmental preservation each time they fly.

Why Sustainable Aviation Fuel Matters

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that Sustainable Aviation Fuel could deliver up to 65% of the emissions reductions needed for the global aviation industry to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. However, SAF currently accounts for just 0.7% of global aviation fuel use, leaving a long road ahead for scaling up production and adoption.

SAF is typically produced from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural waste, and other bio-based materials. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF significantly lowers lifecycle carbon emissions — in some cases by up to 80%. It can also be blended seamlessly with existing jet fuel, allowing airlines to use it without modifying their aircraft engines.

By driving demand through policy, Singapore is creating market confidence that could stimulate global investment in SAF production. This move aligns with the broader sustainable tourism movement, as travelers increasingly prefer airlines and destinations that demonstrate environmental responsibility.

Regional Momentum: Thailand Joins the Sustainable Push

Singapore’s leadership is already inspiring regional action. In neighboring Thailand, the Department of Energy Business has announced that the country’s first national standard for SAF specifications will be released within this month. The new standard will come into effect on January 1 next year, marking a significant milestone in Southeast Asia’s collective effort to reduce the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.

By developing standardized fuel criteria, Thailand is ensuring that locally produced and imported SAF meets international quality and safety benchmarks. This alignment will facilitate easier trade and cooperation across borders, allowing airlines to adopt eco-friendly fuel options with greater confidence.

Together, Singapore and Thailand are creating a blueprint for sustainable aviation in Asia, setting the stage for other countries to follow suit.

Tourism and the Future of Green Aviation in Asia

For the tourism sector, these developments could not come at a better time. Post-pandemic travel demand continues to soar, but so do concerns about the environmental consequences of flying. By integrating sustainability into aviation policy, Singapore and Thailand are sending a clear message that growth and responsibility can coexist.

Eco-conscious tourists are increasingly seeking destinations that prioritize environmental ethics, and the rise of SAF-backed flights offers them tangible ways to make greener travel choices. Sustainable aviation initiatives not only reduce emissions but also enhance the appeal of these destinations as leaders in responsible tourism.

Travelers arriving at Changi Airport or exploring the natural wonders of Thailand can now be part of a global sustainability journey — one that connects leisure, business, and climate action.

Global Context: Aligning With Long-Term Climate Goals

Singapore’s levy aligns closely with the global aviation industry’s broader sustainability roadmap. As countries pledge to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement, initiatives like this help bridge the gap between ambition and action.

By leveraging its role as an international aviation hub, Singapore demonstrates how small island nations can exert outsized influence on global environmental policy. Its proactive stance could encourage more nations to introduce green levies or adopt centralized SAF procurement systems.

The ripple effect could accelerate investment in SAF production facilities, stimulate technological innovation, and ultimately lower costs for airlines and passengers worldwide.

A Greener Horizon for Global Air Travel

The road to decarbonizing aviation is long and complex, but Singapore’s initiative proves that pragmatic, well-planned policies can make a difference.

Replacing windows with cameras and a 4K resolution feed also improves both the aerodynamics and fuel efficiency enough to make chartering private more affordable than business class.

Otto Aerospace has tentatively earmarked 2027 for the Phantom 3500’s maiden flight.

In an industry that prides itself on providing more, Otto Aerospace has found a path forward by stripping something away (sort of).

As first reported by The Wall Street Journal, the Texas-based aviation company’s Phantom 3500 business jet will soon be carrying nine passengers at a time across the skies… without traditional single windows.

Instead, the cabin is wrapped in towering six-foot-wide digital panes, each powered by high-resolution exterior cameras, offering fliers enhanced 4K renders of the horizon in colour-saturated clarity (something Otto Aerospace CEO Paul Touw dubbed “supernatural vision”).

“You could sit in our seat and look at the entire world around you… It is surreal,” Touw told The Wall Street Journal.

But this isn’t just another vanity project to benefit one-percenters.

Without the structural weight of windows, Otto Aerospace’s teardrop-shaped private jet promises a 60% cut in fuel burn compared with peers – a radical efficiency that could, in theory, make chartering private cheaper than flying business class on commercial carriers.

The concept has already seduced the likes of Flexjet, one of America’s biggest names in private aviation, inking a contract valued at an estimated US$5.85 billion for 300 Phantom 3500s – deliveries are slated for the early 2030s.

Flexjet – valued north of US$4 billion and recently buoyed by an US$800 million injection from LVMH-affiliated private equity firm L Catterton, is betting that its clientele (CEOs, ultra-high-net-worth families, younger generation of tech-native flyers) will embrace the Instagrammable novelty and Trojan gamechanger.

For context, the company already curates rarefied perks like Napa Valley tastings and philanthropic galas. A futuristic, windowless cabin feels like the natural extension of its brand.

And as for Otto Aerospace, the Phantom 3500 is just the beginning.

Backed by US$250 million in private investment and an additional US$515 million state government incentive package, the start-up has built its first full-scale mockup and is already eyeing larger regional aircraft once Phantom jet takes hold; with the US$43 billion annual market for business aviation at stake – far more lucrative than the frontier fantasies of space tourism, claims Paul Touw.

“Everybody’s running around excited about Firefly and SpaceX. But the market for moving wealthy people around the world every day is actually much bigger than the market for moving stuff into space,” said the chief executive.

The cherry on top of this exceedingly ambitious sundae?

Avtalet följer det miljötillstånd som beviljats av Mark- och miljödomstolen i Umeå och innebär att projektet nu går in i genomförandefas. De underskrivna avtalen reglerar bland annat finansiering och garantier bolagen emellan.

Byggs intill kraftvärmeverket

Anläggningen, med projektnamnet FlagshipThree, kommer att byggas intill Umeå Energis kraftvärmeverk Dåvaverket i Umeå Eco Industrial Park. Den planeras producera upp till 100 000 ton e-metanol per år och samtidigt fånga in 150 000 ton biogen koldioxid med hjälp av koldioxidinfångning och -användning (CCU). Planen är att komma igång med byggnation 2026 och ta anläggningen i drift 2028.

– Det är en viktig milstolpe för vårt team, och resultatet av ett starkt och konstruktivt samarbete med Umeå Energi. Med avtal på plats och tillstånd beviljade går vi nu in i nästa fas, som erbjuder investerare en tydlig väg till klimatnytta och långsiktigt värde, säger Claes Fredriksson, vd på Liquid Wind i en presskommentar.

Elektrobränslet – en fossilfri metanol som kan ersätta fossila bränslen i bland annat sjöfart och flyg – produceras genom att biogen koldioxid fångas in från kraftvärmeverkens rökgaser, som uppstår vid förbränning av skogsrester. Koldioxiden reagerar sedan med vätgas med hjälp av en katalysator och omvandlas till elektrobränsle.

– Det här blir en anläggning i teknisk framkant som skapar nytta för Umeåborna, men också för Sverige och internationellt, säger Jan Ridfeldt, vd på Umeå Energi.

Supported by Amadeus, BBVA, Repsol, and Telefónica, the program allows businesses to link part of their Scope 3 emissions to the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), reports INSPENET.

The initiative was created to encourage companies to take an active role in reducing emissions in the aviation sector. Through SAF Circle, corporate and cargo flights operated by Iberia can use SAF certified under the European Renewable Energy Directive. Companies participating in the program receive certification for their use of SAF, which can help improve their performance on environmental and sustainability measures.

Companies are grouped into tiers, which come with rewards in Iberia’s loyalty program and access to better services. The program is designed to combine environmental responsibility with business benefits, giving companies an incentive to adopt cleaner fuels.

Some of the fuel used in the program comes from Repsol’s Cartagena plant, which can produce up to 250,000 tons of SAF per year. This supports Spain’s clean energy industry and positions SAF as a practical alternative to traditional kerosene.

SAF can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle, without requiring any changes to aircraft engines or airport infrastructure. SAF Circle offers an immediate solution for companies looking to reduce indirect emissions from business travel and cargo transport.

Executives from the participating companies said such partnerships are essential for moving toward cleaner energy.

Yulianto menambahkan selain memenuhi standar kualitas BBM, operasional Kilang Cilacap sudah menerapkan standar keselamatan dan keamanan yang sangat tinggi.
“Kilang Cilacap merupakan kilang dengan hasil produk terbanyak dibandingkan kilang milik Pertamina lainnya, meliputi BBM Perta Series, solar, LPG, dan avtur konvensional maupun SAF,” ujar Wahyu.
KPI menargetkan pada tahun 2027, kandungan sulfur pada produk BBM yang dihasilkan kilang Pertamina akan terus dikurangi.
“Masih dalam tahapan perencanaan itu misalnya Diesel Hydrotreater, kemudian GSH, Gasoline Selected Hydrotreater,” tutur mantan GM Kilang Cilacap tersebut.","INDRAMAYU – PT KIlang Pertamina Internasional (KPI) memastikan kualitas produk bahan bakar minyak (BBM) yang diproduksi sudah diuji secara ketat agar memenuhi spesifikasi standar. Uji kualitas produk BBM dilakukan di semua kilang yang dimiliki KPI dengan menggunakan mesin CFR (Cooperative Fuel Research) yang merupakan alat standar internasional yang digunakan untuk menguji ketahanan bahan bakar terhadap knocking (detonasi), terutama untuk menentukan angka oktan (RON) dan angka setana (Cetane Number).

“Alat pengujian di seluruh kilang yang ada di dunia menggunakan CFR. Ini single brand yang dari Amerika Serikat. Seluruh kilang Pertamina memiliki alat ini sehingga produk yang telah lolos pengujian dipastikan telah memenuhi standar internasional. Semua produk BBM kami sebelum dipasarkan sudah melewati proses pengujian ini dan telah tersertifikasi,” tutur Yulianto Triwibowo, General Manager Pertamina RU VI Balongan, di Indramayu, pekan lalu.

Yulianto menambahkan selain memenuhi standar kualitas BBM, operasional Kilang Cilacap sudah menerapkan standar keselamatan dan keamanan yang sangat tinggi. Apalagi, kata dia, kilang-kilang Pertamina ini usianya sudah cukup tua. “Kami di Pertamina terus melakukan berbagai improvement untuk menjaga keandalan kilang. Semua itu kami lakukan agar Pertamina tetap menjadi kebanggaan Indonesia. Walaupun banyak tantangan, kami tetap bekerja dengan tenang dan fokus,” kata dia.

Manager Engineering & Development Kilang Balongan Hadi Siswanto menjelaskan Kilang Balongan memiliki kapasitas 150 ribu barel per hari (bph), atau sekitar 14,2% dari kapasitas total kilang milik Pertamina. Produk utama Kilang Cilacap adalah Bahan Bakar Khusus (BBK) seperti Pertamax, Pertamax Turbo, Avtur Pertadex sebanyak 52%, BBM (Premium dan Solar) 26%, Propylene dan LPG masing-masing 6%, produk aviation sebanyak 1%, dan sisanya produk lain-lain (HMOC, Decant Oil, LCO Mix, dan GO Foam) sebesar 9%.

“Sebanyak 82% produk Kilang Cilacap memenuhi kebutuhan di DKI dan Jawa Barat, 12% wilayah lain, dan sebanyak 6% di ekspor ke Singapura berupa Decant Oil,” kata Hadi.

Sementara itu, General Manager RU IV Kilang Cilacap Wahyu Sulistyo Wibowo mengatakan Kilang Cilacap memproduksi semua produk BBM, mulai dari Perta Series, solar, avtur dan yang terbaru adalah Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) atau bahan bakar pesawat terbang berbahan minyak jelantah. Wahyu menjelaskan, sebelum dilempar ke pasaran, produk-produk BBM tersebut diuji terlebih dahulu di laboratorium internal Kilang Cilacap. “Pengujian tersebut termasuk dalam menentukan Research Octane Number (RON) pada BBM. Pengujian dilakukan menggunakan mesin CFR,” katanya.

Dia menjelaskan mesin CFR bekerja dengan mensimulasikan kondisi pembakaran di dalam mesin kendaraan, termasuk tekanan, suhu dan rasio kompresi yang dikontrol secara ketat, sehingga hasilnya dapat digunakan untuk memastikan kualitas bahan bakar sesuai standar,” ujar Wahyu, akhir pekan.

Menurut Wahyu, semua produk yang diuji dalam laboratorium dipastikan dengan kualitas baik, bahkan bisa melebihi spesifikasi standar. Misalnya, untuk BBM jenis Pertalite dengan RON 90, dalam pengujian di laboratorium hasil RON yang muncul di alat bisa 90,1 atau 90,2. “Jika angka yang muncul di bawah standar yang ditentukan, maka pengujian dilakukan lagi dari awal, hingga hasilnya sesuai. Kami tidak pernah menjual BBM ke masyarakat dengan spesifikasi lebih rendah dari yang ditentukan,” ungkap Wahyu.

Dengan begitu, ia meminta masyarakat tidak perlu khawatir dengan kualitas BBM yang diproduksi oleh KPI. Wahyu menjelaskan semua produk BBM tersebut telah diolah dengan pengawasan ketat, untuk memastikan kualitasnya paripurna sebelum didistribusikan. “Semua produk yang kami hasilkan terjamin kualitasnya, sesuai dengan spesifikasi yang ditentukan sehingga aman untuk digunakan masyarakat,” tandas Wahyu.

Selain pengujian di laboratorium internal, BBM yang diproduksi oleh KPI juga diuji dilaboratorium eksternal, sebagai bentuk pengendalian mutu yang berkelanjutan. Salah satunya, pengujian dilakukan di Balai Besar Pengujian Minyak dan Gas Bumi (BBPMGB) LEMIGAS yang merupakan laboratorium independen, pada periode Agustus-September lalu.

Wahyu mengatakan, hasil pengujian tersebut menunjukkan kalau semua produk BBM olahan KPI memenuhi spesifikasi yang telar disyaratkan dalam Keputusan Direktur Jenderal Minyak dan Gas Bumi, Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM). Adapun produk yang diuji di LEMIGAS diantaranya BBM jenis Pertalite, Pertamax, Pertamax Turbo, Pertadex, Biosolar dan Avtur atau bahan bakar pesawat terbang. “Hasil pengujian ini membuktikan kalau proses pengolahan di KPI tetap optimal dan menghasilkan produk energi yang sesuai dengan standar nasional,” kata dia.

Kilang Cilacap memiliki total kapasitas pengolahan 348 ribu bph yang terdiri dari dua Crude Distillation Unit (CDU). CDU-1 sudah beroperasi sejak 1976 berkapasitas 100 ribu bph dan CDU-2 beroperasi pada 1984 dengan kapasitas 200 ribu bph.

Pada tahun 1997, Kilang Cilacap melakukan revamping atau pengembangan, menambah kapasitas CDU-1 menjdi 118 ribu bph, dan CDU-2 menjadi 230 ribu bph. Dengan begitu, total kapasitas Kilang Cilacap menjadi 348 ribu bph. “Saat ini merupakan kilang terbesar milik Pertamina. Nanti, mungkin kedua setelah Proyek RDMP Balikpapan selesai dan diintegrasikan dengan kilang eksisting dengan kapasitas 360 ribu bph,” ungkapnya.

Selain itu, Kilang Cilacap memiliki Residual Fluid Catalytic Cracking (RFCC) mulai 2015 dengan kapasitas 62 ribu bph. Unit ini didesain untuk mengolah residu menjadi produk dengan nilai ekonomi tinggi seperti LPG, Propylene, Polygasoline (mogas dengan RON 98), Naptha (RON 92), Light Sycle Oil (LCO) danDecant Oil (DCO).

Sementara produk bahan bakar hijau (biofuel) diproduksi melalui Unit Treated Distillate Hydro Treating (TDHT). Pengolahan dilakukan secara co-processing antara Refined Bleached Deodorized Palm Oil (RBDPO), Refined, Bleached, and Deodorized Palm Kernel Oil (RBDPKO), maupun minyak jelantah (UCO). “Kilang Cilacap merupakan kilang dengan hasil produk terbanyak dibandingkan kilang milik Pertamina lainnya, meliputi BBM Perta Series, solar, LPG, dan avtur konvensional maupun SAF,” ujar Wahyu.

Kurangi Kandungan Sulfur

KPI menargetkan pengurangan kandungan sulfur pada produksi BBM. VP Process & Facility KPI, Edy Januari Utama, mengatakan peta jalan pengembangan kilang akan dilakukan dengan beberapa kategori. Pertama yakni memenuhi batasan spesifikasi, salah satunya kandungan sulfur. Dia mencontohkan, kadar sulfur pada produk Diesel awalnya sebesar 3.500 part per million (ppm), kemudian dikurangi menjadi 2.500 dan 2.000 ppm pada produk Biosolar. “Kadar sulfurnya selalu dikurangi menjadi lebih baik lagi,” katanya.

KPI menargetkan pada tahun 2027, kandungan sulfur pada produk BBM yang dihasilkan kilang Pertamina akan terus dikurangi. “Untuk itu aka nada beberapa proyek yang sudah disiapkan,” tuturnya.

Pertamina baru saja meluncurkan produk Diesel X melalui unit Gas Oil Hydrotreater di Kilang Balongan. Edy mengungkapkan, perusahaan tengah merencanakan unit yang sama untuk produk Gasoline alias bensin. “Masih dalam tahapan perencanaan itu misalnya Diesel Hydrotreater, kemudian GSH, Gasoline Selected Hydrotreater,” tutur mantan GM Kilang Cilacap tersebut.(LH)",https://www.dunia-energi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CML2629.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 07:22:48.110163

Addressing AASA’s 55th Annual General Assembly (AGA) in Lusaka, Zambia, Munetsi said for too long, African aviation has been underestimated — especially by Africans.
On supply chain, he noted that the global shortage of air- craft and parts has severely affected African airlines.
Manufacturers quote up to six-year delivery lead-times, which requires older, less efficient aircraft to be kept in service for longer.
Only by working together can we ensure Africa’s aviation sector finally takes off and becomes far more than a twoper cent player in the global market,” he concluded.","…excessive taxes, charges make travel expensive

The Chief Executive Officer of Airlines Association of Southern Africa (AASA), Aaron Munetsi, said airlines, airports, air navigation services, regulators and equipment suppliers all had a part to play in rewriting Africa’s aviation negative narrative and demonstrating that African carriers can hold their own globally.

This is coming as he lamented that Africa’s carriers face more than $220 million in additional supply chain-related costs this year alone, with a call that if governments genuinely want to democratise air transport, they should remove excessive statutory charges and taxes that have driven up costs, made ticket prices higher and pushed air transport beyond the reach of most Africans.

Addressing AASA’s 55th Annual General Assembly (AGA) in Lusaka, Zambia, Munetsi said for too long, African aviation has been underestimated — especially by Africans. He further noted that Africa is home to 1.4 billion people, the world’s youngest population and a growing middle class, but with just 2.2 per cent of the global air transport market share, “we are still idling on the run- way”.

The group called for a bold, collective effort to democratise and liberate the continent’s aviation sector through a series of interventions, including harmonising regulations, opening markets to competition, stabilising the industry supply chain, financial discipline, governance as well as fixing critical aviation infrastructure and related services.

Restoring confidence in Africa’s Skies, Munetsi out- lined AASA’s multi-pronged strategy for boosting Africa’s air transport sector, such as safety and standards, adding that Africa must harmonise oversight and recognise mutual licensing and certification — as the EU did in the 1990s — to support SAATM implementation and improve efficiency.

On supply chain, he noted that the global shortage of air- craft and parts has severely affected African airlines. Manufacturers quote up to six-year delivery lead-times, which requires older, less efficient aircraft to be kept in service for longer.

For financial sustainability, he called on state-owned airlines to be run with accountability, cost discipline, innovation and partnerships to drive better financial performance.

Munetsi stated that despite Africa’s small 2% share of global aviation emissions, governments should be facilitating investments in locally produced sustainable aviation fuel while their aviation infrastructure services should be improving operational procedures to help airlines reduce fuel burn and carbon emissions.

To him, empowering Africa’s youth, women, and innovators is key and requires investments in training, mentorship and inclusion, reiterating that in tandem, archaic protectionist practices and processes that restrict growth had to be stopped with governments rolling back excessive taxes and charges on air transport.

Munetsi raised concerns about operational inefficiencies and safety failures in South Africa, citing the on- going suspension of over 200 instrument flight procedures by Air Traffic and Navigation Services (ATNS), which continues to disrupt airline operations and cost airlines millions of dollars in additional fuel, engine wear and maintenance, crew flight duty, flight operations sup- port, customer compensation and reputational damage.

AASA is worried that the glacial pace at which air- space management failures are being addressed meant the scale of the economic impact is not fully grasped. “The failure to design, manage and maintain air- space cannot be dismissed as an ‘inconvenience’.

It needs to be seen for what it is; an economic disaster which demands a commensurate emergency disaster response. The lack of urgency is reflected in the glacial pace at which approval renewals were being processed,” he emphasised.

AASA also called on governments to invest in digital border and customs systems and to relax restrictive visa regimes that deter travel. It also wants to see Mozambique and other governments with foreign reserves release airlines’ blocked funds and let local airlines access foreign currency to purchase aircraft spare parts and cover other dollar-priced costs.

“African aviation’s success depends on collaboration and shared responsibility. It’s time to stop talking and start improving. Only by working together can we ensure Africa’s aviation sector finally takes off and becomes far more than a twoper cent player in the global market,” he concluded.",https://newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BUSINESS-NEWS.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 07:23:01.042313

Dia menuturkan, produk BBM yang diuji di Lemigas diantaranya BBM jenis Pertalite, Pertamax, Pertamax Turbo, Pertadex, Biosolar dan Avtur atau bahan bakar pesawat terbang.

Oleh sebab itu, Wahyu meminta masyarakat tak perlu khawatir dengan kualitas BBM yang diproduksi oleh KPI. Dia menegaskan seluruh produk BBM telah diolah dengan pengawasan ketat, untuk memastikan kualitasnya terjaga sebelum didistribusikan.

Adapun, Kilang Cilacap memproduksi semua produk BBM, mulai dari Perta Series, solar, avtur dan yang terbaru adalah Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) atau bahan bakar pesawat terbang berbahan minyak jelantah.

“Hasil pengujian ini membuktikan kalau proses pengolahan di KPI tetap optimal dan menghasilkan produk energi yang sesuai dengan standar nasional,” pungkas Wahyu.

Sebelumnya, praktisi industri migas memandang batalnya pembelian BBM dasaran atau base fuel oleh PT Vivo Energy Indonesia hingga PT Aneka Petroindo Raya (BP-AKR) dari PT Pertamina (Persero) mencerminkan tingginya standar kualitas bensin milik operator SPBU swasta.

Direktur Utama PT Petrogas Jatim Utama Cendana (PJUC) Hadi Ismoyo berpendapat kandungan etanol sebesar 3,5% yang ditemukan di dalam BBM dasaran atau base fuel yang ditawarkan Pertamina memang masih jauh di bawah ambang batas Ditjen Migas Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM) di level 20%.

Akan tetapi, operator SPBU swasta dinilai memiliki kebutuhan BBM dengan spesifikasi tinggi, sehingga adanya campuran etanol dalam base fuel berpotensi mengganggu formula bensin milik badan usaha (BU) hilir migas swasta.

“Kasus ini menjadi makin jelas, bahwa spek base fuel walau secara umum tidak masalah, tetapi karena demi standar sebuah brand yang sudah demikian kuat, base fuel pun meminta spesifikasi yang excellent,” kata Hadi melalui pesan singkat, Kamis (2/10/2025).

Dalam perkembangannya, PT Pertamina Patra Niaga (PPN) angkat bicara soal polemik yang belakangan muncul terkait dengan campuran etanol dalam base fuel di tengah masyarakat.

Pj. Corporate Secretary Pertamina Patra Niaga Roberth MV Dumatubun mengatakan campuran etanol itu hal yang biasa dalam bisnis BBM dan lumrah digunakan di sejumlah negara seperti Amerika Serikat (AS), Brasil hingga Thailand.

“Penggunaan BBM dengan campuran etanol hingga 10% telah menjadi best practice di banyak negara seperti di Amerika, Brasil, bahkan negara tetangga seperti Thailand,” kata Roberth seperti dikutip dari siaran pers, Kamis (2/10/2025).

Selain itu, Roberth menambahkan, campuran etanol itu juga belakangan diadopsi sebagian negara untuk mendukung program pengurangan emisi karbon.

“Bagian dari upaya mendorong energi yang lebih ramah lingkungan sekaligus mendukung pengurangan emisi karbon,” kata Roberth.

Di sisi lain, Roberth menekankan pentingnya ruang negosiasi yang saling menghormati terkait dengan pengadaan base fuel tersebut dengan operator jaringan SPBU swasta.

“Kami memastikan seluruh produk BBM yang disalurkan sesuai dengan spesifikasi resmi pemerintah serta mekanisme pengadaan yang berlaku,” tuturnya.

Adapun, dua kargo BBM dasaran yang diimpor Pertamina mulanya ditujukan untuk dijual ke operator SPBU swasta. Kargo pertama tiba pada Rabu (24/9/2025), sedangkan yang kedua pada Kamis (2/10/2025).

Akan tetapi, kargo BBM dasaran dengan volume masing-masing 100.000 barel tersebut tidak laku terjual ke BU hilir migas swasta karena berbagai alasan. Vivo sebelumnya membatalkan pesanan 40.000 barel base fuel karena isu kandungan etanol 3,5%, sedangkan BP-AKR menyoal ketiadaan certificate of origin.",https://images.bloombergtechnoz.com/data/2025/03/image-20250329122420.jpg,N,,2025-10-19 06:57:31.862810

The project is part of the oil-to-telecom conglomerate's broader push towards clean energy and achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2035.

In an investor presentation post announcement of its second quarter earnings, Reliance said project development across the 5,50,000-acre site in Kutch is progressing well, with engineering and feasibility studies completed, and the site is currently in various stages of land development.

""Expected to start commissioning solar generation during the first half of the next year for captive requirements plus green fuels production,"" it said.

Four years ago, Reliance Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani announced a USD 10 billion investment in a 'new energy' business. That was seen as a notable change of tide, given the conglomerate's mega-scale petroleum refining operation that Ambani spearheaded back in the 1990s.

With that, Reliance began work on a new integrated renewable energy manufacturing hub named after the group's founder - the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex.

At the company's annual shareholder meeting this year, Anant Ambani - the chairman's youngest son - gave a glimpse into its scale. A build area four times the size of Tesla's gigafactory, a steel order large enough to build 100 Eiffel Towers and a stretch of cables enough to 'reach the moon and back'.

The gigafactories at Jamnagar - home to the company's refining and petrochemical complex - will produce gears used in generating electricity from sunlight and the battery value chain. Alongside, in Kutch, it is developing one of the world's largest single-site solar projects spanning 5,50,000 acres of arid land - three times the size of Singapore.

Reliance's clean energy plans span solar PV, battery storage, green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel.

The firm is on track to set up 20GWp of solar PV manufacturing capacity and 100GWh of battery giga-factory. Reliance has also pledged to produce 3 million tonnes per annum of green hydrogen by 2032, while manufacturing equipment like electrolysers, battery storage and solar panels in-house.

In the investor presentation, the company said it continues to gradually expand its solar photovoltaic giga-factory. ""Already commissioned 4 PV module lines, and the first cell line is expected to be commissioned soon,"" Reliance said, adding that it is on track to achieve its targeted capacity and further expand in a modular fashion.

The PV solar manufacturing chain includes production of polysilicon - high-purity silicon produced from metallurgical grade silicon (sand). This is followed by ingot and wafer creation - polysilicon being melted and cooled to form ingots (either monocrystalline cylinders or multicrystalline blocks). These ingots are then sliced into thin wafers, which form the base of the solar cell.

Then comes the cell manufacturing - silicon wafers are processed through various steps, including doping, cleaning, and coating. Laser scribing is used to pattern the cells, and copper ribbons are applied for electrical connections.

Multiple cells are connected together and laminated between sheets of glass and encapsulant to create a waterproof module, or panel. These modules are then assembled into arrays with racking systems, which are support structures for mounting them on areas receiving sunlight.

With sunlight being available only during daytime, Reliance is also setting up gigafactories for the battery value chain to provide round-the-clock power.

""The work on Battery Energy Storage giga-factory is progressing at a rapid pace,"" the firm said, adding it has achieved significant construction and engineering progress on-site for 40 GWh manufacturing capacity, and production line equipment is on track for installation on the foundation.",https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2025-04/20/full/1745171767-117.jpg,N,,2025-10-19 06:57:50.150192

BUMN energi ini mampu menjaga ketersediaan energi dalam negeri di tengah dinamika geopolitik yang mengancam pasokan energi global.

Direktur Utama PT Pertamina (Persero), Simon Aloysius Mantiri menegaskan komitmen Pertamina untuk terus berkontribusi dalam mendukung misi Asta Cita Pemerintahan Prabowo – Gibran, dengan mendorong kemandirian bangsa melalui swasembada energi.

Menurut Simon, kontribusi Pertamina dalam menjamin pasokan energi tercermin pada kinerja operasional yang terus menunjukkan tren positif, terutama di sektor hulu Migas yang menjadi tulang punggung ketahanan energi nasional.

“Saat ini, Pertamina mengelola 24 persen wilayah kerja operator migas di Indonesia. Kami terus menjalankan amanah Pemerintah dengan berperan sebagai pemain kunci dalam upaya menjaga ketahanan energi di tengah meningkatnya kebutuhan energi nasional,” ujar Simon.

Simon mengungkapkan, pembuktian kontribusi atas ketahanan energi ditandai dengan produksi migas Pertamina terus meningkat yang kini mencapai 1,04 juta barel setara minyak per hari (MMBOEPD), yang terdiri dari produksi minyak 557 ribu barel per hari (MBOPD) dan produksi gas 2,8 miliar standar kaki kubik per hari (BSCFD) per semester 1 tahun 2025.

Tidak hanya produksi, Pertamina juga mendorong anak usaha sektor hulu untuk agresif memperkuat cadangan untuk mendapat sumberdaya energi baru, baik melalui kegiatan Survei Seismik 3D maupun pengeboran sumur eksplorasi.

Hasilnya, Pertamina mendapat tambahan sumberdaya 2C (contingent resources) dengan realisasi 2C Validation sebesar 804 juta barel setara minyak (MMBOE) dan menambah cadangan migas terbukti (P1) sebesar 63 juta barel setara minyak (MMBOE).

Produksi dan cadangan migas Indonesia akan semakin kuat dengan tuntasnya proyek strategis Pertamina antara lain pengembangan Stasiun Pengumpul Akasia Bagus (SP ABG) EP, Proyek Sisi Nubi, Proyek CEOR lapangan minas di Area A Stage-1 dan proyek Lapangan OO-OX.

“Capaian tersebut semakin menguatkan posisi Pertamina sebagai kontributor utama produksi migas nasional, untuk minyak 69 persen dan gas 37 persen, sehingga dapat lebih optimal memasok kebutuhan energi nasional,” tambahnya.

Secara simultan lanjutnya, Pertamina juga berupaya mewujudkan swasembada energi dengan mengembangkan energi baru terbarukan.

Selama satu tahun pemerintahan Prabowo – Gibran, Pertamina berhasil melakukan inovasi teknologi untuk pengembangan produk bahan bakar rendah karbon.

Hal ini telah dibuktikan dengan keberhasilan kilang Pertamina dalam memproduksi Sustainable Aviation Fuel berbasis Minyak Jelantah (Used Cooking Oil/UCO) dan implementasi Biodiesel 40 persen (B40).

Dukungan Pertamina dalam ketahanan energi juga semakin terlihat, dengan komitmen Pertamina sebagai pemimpin dalam transisi energi. Sejalan Asta Cita Presiden Prabowo Subianto, yang mendorong optimalisasi pemanfaatan energi terbarukan, termasuk panas bumi.

Pertamina melalui anak usaha dari Subholding Pertamina New and Renewable Energy, PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy Tbk (PGE) saat ini mengelola kapasitas terpasang sebesar 727 MW dari enam wilayah operasi.

PGE fokus dalam mewujudkan target 1 GW dalam 2–3 tahun ke depan dan 1,7 GW pada 2034.

Uji kualitas produk BBM dilakukan di semua kilang, salah satunya di Cilacap, Jawa Tengah dilakukan agar memenuhi spesifikasi standar.

General Manager Kilang Cilacap, Wahyu Sulistyo Wibowo menjelaskan, sebelum dilempar ke pasaran, produk-produk BBM tersebut diuji terlebih dahulu di laboratorium internal Kilang Cilacap. Pengujian tersebut termasuk dalam menentukan Research Octane Number (RON) pada BBM. Sehingga bisa dipastikan dengan kualitas baik, bahkan bisa melebihi spesifikasi standar.

Wahyu mencontohkan, untuk BBM jenis Pertalite dengan RON 90, dalam pengujian di laboratorium hasil RON yang muncul di alat bisa 90,1 atau 90,2. Jika angka yang muncul di bawah standar yang ditentukan, maka pengujian dilakukan lagi dari awal, hingga hasilnya sesuai.

Menurutnya, kilang Cilacap ini memproduksi semua produk BBM, mulai dari Perta Series, solar, avtur dan yang terbaru adalah Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) atau bahan bakar pesawat terbang berbahan minyak jelantah.

“Jadi RON serendah-rendahnya adalah 90 sesuai standar, tidak boleh kurang tapi bisa di atasnya. Kami tidak pernah menjual BBM ke masyarakat dengan spesifikasi lebih rendah dari yang ditentukan,” tegas Wahyu.

Dia memaparkan, pengujian dilakukan menggunakan mesin CFR (Cooperative Fuel Research) yang merupakan alat standar internasional yang digunakan untuk menguji ketahanan bahan bakar terhadap knocking (detonasi), terutama untuk menentukan angka oktan (RON) dan angka setana (Cetane Number).

“Mesin ini bekerja dengan mensimulasikan kondisi pembakaran di dalam mesin kendaraan, termasuk tekanan, suhu dan rasio kompresi yang dikontrol secara ketat, sehingga hasilnya dapat digunakan untuk memastikan kualitas bahan bakar sesuai standar,” ujar Wahyu.

Dia pyn meminta masyarakat tidak perlu khawatir dengan kualitas BBM yang diproduksi oleh KPI. “Semua produk yang kami hasilkan terjamin kualitasnya, sesuai dengan spesifikasi yang ditentukan sehingga aman untuk digunakan masyarakat,” ujar Wahyu.

Selain pengujian di laboratorium internal, BBM yang diproduksi oleh KPI juga diuji dilaboratorium eksternal, sebagai bentuk pengendalian mutu yang berkelanjutan. Salah satunya, pengujian dilakukan di Balai Besar Pengujian Minyak dan Gas Bumi (BBPMGB) LEMIGAS yang merupakan laboratorium independen, pada periode Agustus-September lalu.

Wahyu mengatakan, hasil pengujian tersebut menunjukkan kalau semua produk BBM olahan KPI memenuhi spesifikasi yang telar disyaratkan dalam Keputusan Direktur Jenderal Minyak dan Gas Bumi, Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM). Adapun produk yang diuji di LEMIGAS diantaranya BBM jenis Pertalite, Pertamax, Pertamax Turbo, Pertadex, Biosolar dan Avtur atau bahan bakar pesawat terbang.",https://media.beritajatim.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1000168903_11zon.webp,N,,2025-10-19 01:00:39.043104

Leia abaixo os principais trechos da entrevista.

O que é a Itaipu Binacional hoje?

A Itaipu é uma revolução tecnológica. Imagine há 51 anos construir uma usina daquele tamanho, uma usina hidrelétrica. A maior usina hidrelétrica do mundo à época. Uma época que não existia software, não tinha computador, não tinha máquina científica. Os cálculos estruturais eram feitos na régua e à mão. É por isso até que Itaipu é mais resistente do que as outras, porque, na dúvida, colocavam um pouco mais [de cimento]. E ela é gigante. Chegou a representar 25% da produção de energia do Brasil. Itaipu é uma empresa pública que tem 50% do capital governo brasileiro e os outros 50% do governo do Paraguai.

Quais os planos da empresa para diversificar a geração de energia?

Nós temos investido muito em atualização tecnológica. São mais de R$ 5 bilhões de reais de investimento para atualizar todo o sistema de gestão de Itaipu e a maneira com que ela produz energia. Concomitante a isso, já há 20 anos, a Itaipu vem investindo em alternativas. Primeiro, em geração distribuída. Nós começamos a a produzir energia através do gás metano, no oeste do Paraná, onde há uma grande produção de suínos. Desenvolvemos essas alternativas a partir da geração distribuída. As leis brasileiras que tratam da geração distribuída surgiram a partir das experiências de Itaipu há 20 anos. Há uns 15 anos, nós começamos com as experiências do hidrogênio verde. O hidrogênio verde está num estágio muito avançado de pesquisa. Apresentaremos na COP30 um barco desenvolvido no nosso parque tecnológico, movido a hidrogênio verde. A partir da nossa experiência do biogás, a partir do nosso conhecimento de hidrogênio verde e com a geração de energia da hidroelétrica, nós estamos avançando muito agora no petróleo sintético para produção do SAF [[Sustainable Aviation Fuel, em inglês, o combustível sustentável de aviação que substitui o querosene fóssil].

E há investimentos em energia fotovoltaica?

Nós estamos agora fazendo uma experiência de placas solares sobre um pedaço do reservatório de Itaipu. E, com isso, nós vamos utilizar essa energia produzida para o consumo da usina, sobrando mais energia da usina para entregar à sociedade brasileira e à paraguaia.

Por que no Brasil há oferta abundante de energia e preços altos?

É um paradoxo. A produção de energia no Brasil mudou. A energia hidráulica, em 2010, representava 91% da geração no Brasil e, hoje, é só 60% do total. A geração térmica representava 9% em 2010 e, hoje, 6%. A eólica representava 4% e, atualmente, 7%. E a solar, que era zero, hoje, é quase 10%. A inovação tecnológica proporcionou o aumento de oferta de energia limpa, barata e de qualidade. Entretanto, essas fontes são intermitentes. Com a atualização tecnológica, ficou mais barato instalar as placas solares e mais pessoas têm comprado essa energia. Por outro lado, há demanda para energia firme nos horários de pico, ocasionando um fato novo. Há excesso de energia ofertada na rede em alguns horários e falta de energia em outro. Quando você tem um excesso de energia ofertada nas redes, por exemplo, entre 12h e 14h, você cria um congestionamento. Pense a rede de transmissão como uma avenida. Se você colocar muito carro, você vai criar um congestionamento. É isso que está acontecendo hoje. Com menos gente comprando energia das distribuidoras, o preço da energia para o restante da população aumenta.

Quais os planos e projetos que Itaipu apresentará na COP-30?

Até 2003, Itaipu só produzia energia.

Wagner Sustainable Fuels, based in Toowoomba, also launched Australia’s first biofuel blending facility on Wednesday, and chief executive Matt Doyle says the nation could seize a big financial and environmental opportunity if it acts quickly.
In transport, for example, sustainable aviation fuel has been flagged as the major solution airlines will use to reach their 2050 net zero target, contributing 65 per cent of the emission reductions required.
“I’m very confident Australia will be delivering close to 10 per cent of our aviation fuel market needs in the early 2030s,” she says.

And a Queensland company at the vanguard of production is establishing a biofuels facility – one of three being built in the race to cut emissions from challenging industries.

Wagner Sustainable Fuels, based in Toowoomba, also launched Australia’s first biofuel blending facility on Wednesday, and chief executive Matt Doyle says the nation could seize a big financial and environmental opportunity if it acts quickly.

“Waste products will be the new oil,” he says.

“We, as a country, have a lot of waste products so we can be a major player in sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel, and low-carbon liquid fuels in general.”

His prediction follows a $1.1 billion federal government investment in biofuel production and the launch of a public consultation into a national strategy for the burgeoning industry.

While momentum is growing, climate experts say biofuels remain difficult and costly to produce, and their widespread acceptance will require governments around the world to mandate their use.

Biofuels, also known as low-carbon liquid fuels, are made from renewable resources such as agricultural waste and can be used to reduce emissions from industries in which there are few other options.

In transport, for example, sustainable aviation fuel has been flagged as the major solution airlines will use to reach their 2050 net zero target, contributing 65 per cent of the emission reductions required.

Domestic airlines such as Qantas and Virgin Australia are already pursuing biofuel opportunities, Doyle says, as alternative technologies are not ready to go the distance.

“There have been a lot of studies done on electric planes, which are good for very short-haul [flights], but they can’t do any longer,” he says.

“Then there’s hydrogen in 2035 or 2040, but that will only be medium-haul. For long-haul, there’s no other solution other than sustainable aviation fuels out to 2050.”

The Toowoomba-based company is developing a sustainable aviation fuel production facility in Brisbane, co-funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, which is expected to produce 114 megalitres of fuel annually.

But the firm’s latest fuel-blending facility at Wellcamp Airport is using imported synthetic fuel to mix with standard jet fuel while waiting for domestic supplies to become available, Doyle says.

“We’re hoping our facility can be a beacon for the federal government to look at and say everything works.

“Then we can get on with making good policy that will grow the industry and benefit Australia.”

Support for biofuels is growing in Australia, with the government announcing a $1.1 billion, 10-year Cleaner Fuels Program in September to boost its production.

Consultation also opened this month for the development of a National Bioenergy Feedstock Strategy to ensure Australia is producing materials needed to create renewable fuel.

After years “wasted in the climate wars”, the announcements are being welcomed by producers and potential users alike, says Bioenergy Australia chief executive Shahana McKenzie.

Despite the industry’s slow start, she says, Australia’s advantages, such as its strong farming sector, make it a natural biofuels leader in the Asia Pacific region.

“Australia is being looked at by all the other players in our region as the most likely contributor, either from a feedstock perspective or from an export perspective,” she says.

“It’s incredibly important that decarbonisation is actively taking place across all [nearby] jurisdictions.”

Australia already has three biodiesel and two ethanol refineries in operation, with three projects in development: Wagner’s Brisbane base, Ampol’s proposed renewable fuels facility in outer Brisbane, and Jet Zero’s Project Ulysses in Townsville.

Other projects are “progressing behind the scenes”, McKenzie says, to help the nation catch up to its potential.

“I’m very confident Australia will be delivering close to 10 per cent of our aviation fuel market needs in the early 2030s,” she says.

“In terms of the flow of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel in country, we are predicting the first project will deliver fuel in 2028.”

But Climate Energy Finance director Tim Buckley says there will be more challenges to adopting biofuel than just producing it.

Renewable fuels are significantly more expensive to produce than conventional varieties, he says, and will have to be mandated in some industries to ensure emission cuts.

“The cost of biofuels is between 50 and 500 per cent the cost of their fossil fuel equivalents, and that’s a huge impediment to their uptake,” he says.

“A lot of biofuels will go into the maritime and aviation industries, but that will only come about if you get mandates.”",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5755%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/t_smh_no_label_no_age_social_wm/655bde7f12ad1d18d87a6a94582a3026bf47d67d,N,,2025-10-18 23:56:11.098081

Dalam rancangan kebijakan tersebut, campuran SAF akan dimulai dari kadar 1%, dan secara bertahap ditingkatkan hingga 5% pada 2035. Langkah ini merupakan bagian dari komitmen Indonesia untuk menekan emisi karbon di sektor penerbangan dan mendukung agenda net zero emission (NZE).

🔹 Maskapai Siap Operasional, Tantangan Ada di Biaya

Sekretaris Jenderal Indonesia National Air Carrier Association (INACA), Bayu Sutanto, mengatakan secara teknis maskapai nasional sudah siap mengoperasikan pesawat dengan bahan bakar campuran SAF. Namun, dari sisi finansial, penerapan aturan ini masih menjadi tantangan besar.

“Secara operasional maskapai sudah siap, tapi secara finansial belum. Kenaikan biaya operasional akibat penggunaan avtur campuran SAF cukup signifikan, sementara harga tiket belum pernah disesuaikan sejak 2019,” ujar Bayu, Jumat (17/10/2025).

Bayu menegaskan, harga avtur SAF lebih mahal dibandingkan avtur konvensional, sehingga tanpa penyesuaian terhadap batas harga tiket, kebijakan ini bisa menekan profitabilitas maskapai.

🔹 Bahan Baku SAF dari Minyak Jelantah

Menurut Bayu, bahan baku SAF yang paling realistis di Indonesia saat ini adalah minyak jelantah (used cooking oil). Meski potensinya besar, tantangan utama justru terletak pada proses pengumpulan bahan baku, ketersediaan kilang pengolahan (refinery), serta distribusi SAF yang belum merata ke seluruh bandara.

“Kendala lain adalah harga avtur dan biaya operasional yang akan meningkat, sehingga berpotensi mendorong kenaikan harga tiket, terutama untuk rute-rute internasional menuju negara yang sudah mewajibkan penggunaan SAF,” tambahnya.

🔹 Usulan INACA: Implementasi Bertahap dan Sukarela

Untuk mengantisipasi lonjakan biaya, INACA mengusulkan agar implementasi SAF dilakukan secara bertahap dan sukarela (voluntary) pada tahap awal.

“Misalnya mulai dengan campuran 0,5%–1% dulu, dan hanya untuk penerbangan internasional dari dan ke Bandara Soekarno-Hatta (CGK) dan Ngurah Rai (DPS),” ujar Bayu.

INACA juga mendorong adanya regulasi pendukung seperti mekanisme carbon credit, carbon tax, serta insentif fiskal untuk membantu industri penerbangan bertransisi ke energi bersih tanpa membebani konsumen.

🔹 Aturan Masih Disusun Pemerintah

Hingga kini, rancangan peraturan terkait SAF masih dalam tahap finalisasi di Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM).

From congested ports to crumbling roads, Nigeria’s trade routes continue to be a source of frustration.","Nigeria’s 200 million youthful, entrepreneurial citizens can vault the nation from demographic promise to global competitiveness if bold, synchronised reforms now turn their talent, trade, and technology into a seamless, predictable engine of prosperity. This was the submission of the Chief Executive Officer of DHL Express, John Pearson in an interaction with Festus Akanbi on the sidelines of a media event- Global Trade Shifts- Spotlights Africa, and launch of DHL’s 2025 Global Connectedness Tracker in Johannesburg, South Africa, last week

Figeria sits on a rare confluence of promise — a young, restless population, vast entrepreneurial energy, a swelling workforce, and a strategic position at the heart of Africa. Yet, in the view of John Pearson, Chief Executive Officer of DHL Express, the country’s demographic blessing will only translate into prosperity if the right policies, partnerships, and infrastructure align to unlock its immense potential.

Speaking in Johannesburg at the unveiling of DHL’s 2025 Global Connectedness Tracker, Pearson told THISDAY that Nigeria’s future will depend on how it converts its people into productivity.

“You have over 200 million people, that’s not a challenge, it’s a superpower,” he declared. “But for that power to work, the systems, from education to logistics and regulation, have to move in the same direction.”

Human Capital: The Real Goldmine

At the centre of Pearson’s argument lies Nigeria’s human capital. With over 200 million citizens, half of them under 30, the country stands on a demographic goldmine. Pearson explained that DHL’s experience in Nigeria has shown the quality and competitiveness of local talent.

“We’ve been able to attract, retain, and grow fantastic Nigerian professionals,” adding that “Some of them have gone on to lead teams in other African countries. That tells you the calibre of people you have here.”

He pointed to DHL’s Certified International Specialist (CIS) programme, a leadership and training model applied consistently across all its global operations. “In Nigeria, our people go through the same training and development as their colleagues in Germany or India. It’s not watered down. That’s how we build global competence locally.”

However, Pearson noted that the wider Nigerian economy has yet to connect education to market realities. He emphasised that reforms must bridge the gap between academic training and industrial demand.

“The world of logistics, trade, and digital commerce is changing so fast. Nigeria’s universities and vocational institutions need to reflect that,” he said, pointing out that “We need to revive technical and apprenticeship programmes, bring industries into classrooms, and ensure graduates have practical skills, not just certificates.”

The DHL boss also underscored the importance of retention. “The continuous brain drain is a symptom, saying people leave when they can’t find stability or predictability at home. Salaries matter, but so do security, infrastructure, and a clear sense of direction.

Trade, Borders, and Bottlenecks

Few companies understand the pulse of trade like DHL. Pearson’s perspective on cross-border efficiency is blunt: Nigeria’s logistics arteries are clogged, and it’s costing the nation dearly.

“As a logistics company, our goal is to make the movement of goods seamless,” he said. “We work closely with customs; in some cases, officials even operate from our premises to speed up clearance. But many of the deeper challenges are systemic. No private company can fix them alone,” he said.

From congested ports to crumbling roads, Nigeria’s trade routes continue to be a source of frustration. Clearing goods from Apapa or Tin Can Island can take days, sometimes weeks, adding heavy costs that erode competitiveness. Pearson believes a “national logistics overhaul” is overdue.

“What Nigeria needs is simplicity and consistency,” he explained. “Simplify customs procedures, harmonise agency roles, digitise documentation, and you’ll see trade volumes and investor confidence rise almost immediately.”

He advocates the full activation of inland dry ports to relieve Lagos of its overwhelming cargo burden, as well as the creation of logistics hubs and cold-chain networks nationwide.

“Improving rail and road connectivity to neighbouring countries will also let Nigeria take real advantage of the African Continental Free Trade Area,” he added.

E-Commerce: The New Frontier

In Pearson’s view, the digital revolution is redefining logistics as much as it is redefining business. “The click-and-ship culture is exploding,” he said. “We’re helping Nigerian merchants go global, optimising their websites, setting transparent pricing, and ensuring reliable delivery timelines.”

DHL, he explained, is building the infrastructure and advisory systems that enable local businesses to plug directly into global markets. Yet, the e-commerce ecosystem remains underdeveloped.

“Too many small businesses are still manual,” he observed. “No digital tracking, no online payment integration. And with poor internet, unreliable electricity, and chaotic address systems, last-mile delivery becomes a nightmare.”

For Nigeria to truly benefit, Pearson believes, the government must make broadband access and digital literacy national priorities. “Once small businesses can operate confidently online, their market stops being their neighbourhood; it becomes the world.”

Sustainability: Delivering the Future Responsibly

Pearson’s passion for sustainability is unmistakable. DHL, he said, has made global commitments to reducing its carbon footprint, investing heavily in sustainable aviation fuel and electric vehicles.

“In Nigeria, we’re already deploying solar-powered facilities and carbon-neutral warehouses,” he noted. “Our global goal is zero emissions by 2050, and that includes every market where we operate.”

However, Pearson acknowledged that Nigeria’s broader ecosystem remains far behind. “You can’t scale electric vehicles without reliable power or charging infrastructure,” he said. “Government incentives, like tax breaks for clean energy and partnerships for renewable grids, would accelerate adoption.”

DHL’s efforts, he argued, can serve as a template for others. “Sustainability shouldn’t be an afterthought. It’s part of competitiveness now. Customers want to know that their logistics partners care about the planet.”

Infrastructure: The Missing Link

Without physical infrastructure, even the best talent and technology falter. Pearson described infrastructure as the “circulatory system” of any modern economy, and Nigeria’s, he said, is weak.

“Ports are congested, roads are deteriorating, rail is underutilised, and warehouses are often outdated,” he said. “You can’t talk about efficient logistics without reliable arteries.”

He called for a National Logistics Master Plan, one that integrates roads, rail, ports, and production zones into a single coordinated framework. “Every delay on the road, every broken bridge, adds cost,” he said. “Fixing these things doesn’t just make trade faster; it makes businesses more competitive.”

Regulatory Consistency and Predictability

One of Pearson’s most persistent themes is predictability. “Investors can handle high costs,” he said, “but what they can’t handle is unpredictability.”

Frequent policy shifts, overlapping regulations, and opaque bureaucracy, he warned, remain Nigeria’s biggest deterrents to foreign investment. “If a business can’t predict clearance times, tariff levels, or regulatory changes, it can’t plan,” he said. “Predictability is the real investment incentive.”

Still, Pearson acknowledged positive examples. “Our collaboration with customs shows that private-public cooperation is possible,” he said. “It just needs to happen more often, with transparency, professionalism, and mutual trust.”

Empowering the SMEs

Beyond the large corporates, Pearson sees small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as the heart of Nigeria’s growth story. DHL’s GoTrade Initiative, he explained, was designed to help small exporters understand international standards, packaging, and logistics.

“We’re helping Nigerian SMEs connect directly to global buyers,” he said. “When small producers can access export finance, proper packaging, and reliable delivery, the entire economy benefits.”

He suggested that banks and government agencies complement such initiatives with affordable trade finance and insurance products. “Clusters of small producers can share logistics costs,” he said. “Incubators and mentorship programmes can also improve business management and export readiness.”

Digitalisation and Data: The Game Changer

To tie all these threads together, Pearson believes in data transparency. “Data is the new oil,” he said. “When you can measure port dwell times, clearance durations, and delivery success rates, you can fix inefficiencies.”

DHL’s use of route optimisation, scanner tracking, and real-time courier communication has significantly improved delivery performance. Nigeria, he argued, should adopt a similar culture of measurement and accountability.

“With reliable data, decisions become smarter, waste is reduced, and customers are happier,” he said.

The Path Forward

Pearson’s insights return to one central truth: predictability fuels prosperity. Investors, entrepreneurs, and workers all thrive when systems are stable and transparent. “Uncertainty kills momentum,” he said. “Predictability builds confidence and confidence drives growth.”

As Nigeria stands at the crossroads of potential and performance, the building blocks are visible: a youthful population, a vast market, creative entrepreneurs, and growing global attention. DHL’s experience, Pearson believes, is proof that progress is possible, with the right reforms.

“Education, infrastructure, digitalisation, sustainability, and regulatory stability, those are the five pillars,” he summarised. “If Nigeria focuses on these, it will move from a story of potential to one of performance.”

He paused, then added with a smile: “At DHL, we don’t just move parcels; we move economies. Nigeria can do the same, not just move goods, but move the entire continent forward.”",https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/John-Pearson.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 23:56:17.329765

“This is a special day for IndiGo as we solidify our commitment to expanding our international network,” said Pieter Elbers, CEO of IndiGo. “Our firm order for 30 additional A350-900s reflects our confidence in India’s aviation growth and our strong partnership with Airbus. These aircraft will play a pivotal role in enabling IndiGo to connect India with more destinations worldwide.”

Airbus–IndiGo Partnership Expands Further

Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, Executive Vice President, Commercial Aircraft Sales at Airbus, noted that the A350’s fuel efficiency, range, and comfort align perfectly with IndiGo’s long-haul ambitions. “We are proud to continue supporting IndiGo, one of the fastest-growing airlines in the world, as it enters new intercontinental markets,” he said.

The A350, recognized as the world’s most modern and efficient widebody aircraft in the 300–410 seat category, delivers up to 25% lower fuel burn and CO₂ emissions compared to previous-generation competitors. The aircraft also supports operations with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) today, with Airbus targeting 100% SAF capability by 2030.

India’s Aviation Growth Accelerates

India, the world’s fastest-growing aviation market, continues to witness rising international travel demand fueled by economic expansion and higher disposable incomes. Airbus has been a strategic partner in India’s aviation journey for over five decades—while the A320 Family has driven the democratization of domestic air travel, the A350 is now poised to help Indian carriers capture global long-haul markets.

by Adekunle Agbetiloye (Business Insider Africa) Kenya Airways Plc is taking a bold step to show that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) can be made and used right in Africa.

Kenya Airways is conducting flights using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blends to test local production feasibility.

The first SAF-blend flight operated from Nairobi to Paris, using biofuel made from drought-resistant plants.

SAF production challenges include higher costs and the lack of local supply infrastructure.

Kenya Airways aims to gradually increase SAF usage to 10% across its fleet by 2030.

Kenya Airways Plc is taking a bold step to show that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) can be made and used right in Africa.

The Nairobi-based airline will operate four return flights between October 14 and 21, each running partly on a SAF blend, as it tests the feasibility of producing the green fuel locally, according to Bloomberg.

The first of these flights took off on Tuesday from Nairobi to Paris, where new European rules require at least 2% SAF on all departing flights. For this journey, the airline used a mix of conventional jet fuel and a locally produced biofuel made from drought-resistant plants such as croton.

Kenya Airways was the first African carrier to operate a long-haul SAF-powered flight in 2023, using biofuel supplied by Italy’s Eni SpA.

But importing SAF is expensive. The green fuel can cost twice as much as regular jet fuel, and up to five times more for African airlines due to logistics and lack of local supply, according to CEO Allan Kilavuka.

Passengers in Africa are not yet willing to pay extra for lower-carbon flights, Kilavuka said. “so we need to find a way to reduce SAF production costs and hopefully get subsidies from organizations or governments.”

Attracting green capital

Kenya Airways will also operate SAF-powered flights from Nairobi to Amsterdam, London, and Cape Town. At European airports, it will refuel with SAF, but the Cape Town return flight will use conventional fuel. The carrier aims to begin with 2% SAF across its fleet and gradually increase to 10% by 2030.

“Connectivity must follow trade,” he said during a media interaction in Delhi. “A direct flight is something we are discussing seriously.”

Oil Cooperation, Energy

Brazil has invited Indian companies to participate in upcoming oil exploration block auctions, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin confirmed during a media interaction in New Delhi.

The invitation is part of a broader effort to deepen cooperation with India in energy security, trade, healthcare, agriculture, and investment.

Sharing key deliverables from his three-day official visit, Alckmin said that Brazil’s National Petroleum Agency will release six oil exploration blocks in the Campos and Santos basins next year, and up to 18 additional blocks may be made available.

“We have invited Indian oil companies to participate in these auctions,” he said.

He also confirmed that Petrobras has signed a contract to supply six million barrels of crude oil to India, and that Brazil continues to import diesel from Indian refiners.

“This is a two-way partnership. We sell oil to India, and we buy refined fuel from India,” Alckmin noted.

A top diplomat later told StratNewsGlobal that “Brazil’s exports of crude to India on the first three quarters of 2025 exceeded $1.13 billion, which represents an increase of 35.5% compared to same period of 2024.”

Alckmin confirmed that both countries, along with the US, are discussing joint efforts under the Global Biofuels Alliance to scale up production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

Trade, MERCOSUR

The Vice President noted that bilateral trade is expected to reach $15 billion by the end of 2025, compared to $12 billion in 2024.

“Our goal is to reach $20 billion as soon as possible,” he said.

Alckmin announced that India and Brazil have reached an understanding to expand preferential tariff lines under the India-MERCOSUR trade framework, and that technical negotiations will aim to conclude within 10 months.

“The current agreement covers a small number of products. Expanding it will increase economic complementarity,” he explained.

He also highlighted MERCOSUR’s ongoing negotiations with partners including Singapore, EFTA, Canada, the European Union, and the United Arab Emirates, noting that Bolivia has now joined MERCOSUR as its fifth full member.

Investment Facilitation, E Visas

Alckmin confirmed the signing of two new deals: an Investment Facilitation Agreement to support bilateral business growth; and a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement to enhance legal and financial certainty for investors.

“These agreements give legal security to businesses from both sides,” he said.

He also announced that starting next week, electronic business visas will be issued by the Brazilian Embassy in New Delhi and the Consulate in Mumbai.

“This will make business travel much easier for Indian professionals and consultants,” he said.

Agriculture, Food Security

Responding to a question on food security, Alckmin pointed out that Brazil’s agriculture sector grew by 16% this year, and that there is strong complementarity with India in areas like fertilizer trade and agribusiness innovation.

“India is the largest food producer. We import large amounts of fertilizer and have deep expertise in agri-business. Our economies do not compete, they complement each other,” he said. He also noted that 80% of Brazil’s cattle herd is of Indian origin.

Healthcare, Pharma

Brazil is looking to deepen its engagement with India’s pharmaceutical industry to support its universal healthcare system.

“There is great interest in Indian drug products,” he said, and confirmed an agreement between Fiocruz (Brazil) and Biological E (India) for vaccine co-development and technology transfer.

BRICS, Strategic Alignment

On global trade tensions and BRICS positioning, Alckmin clarified: “BRICS is not against anyone. It is in favour of multilateralism and free trade.”

The retrofit, developed with Aviation Partners Boeing, will improve efficiency, cut drag, and reduce fuel burn on each flight.

Delta already uses the older Blended Winglets on its 737, 757, and 767 fleets. The new Split Scimitar design features both an upward and downward fin, creating weaker wingtip vortices and delivering up to 2% fuel savings. The upgrade is part of Delta’s wider push to cut emissions and reach net-zero by 2050.

Fuel accounts for one of the airline’s largest costs, and even small improvements can save millions of gallons per year. The carrier has also pledged to expand use of sustainable aviation fuel, modernize its fleet, and invest in new green technologies.

Passengers may not notice the change in design, but the impact on Delta’s carbon footprint could be huge.

Since its inaugural service in 2000, Emirates has flown 2.8 million passengers across fifteen thousand nine hundred flights, connecting Ugandans to more than onevhundred forty-five destinations worldwide through its hub at Dubai International Airport (DXB). The airline commemorated the occasion with a special four-class Boeing 777 flight, showcasing its fully refurbished cabins, including Premium Economy, which made its debut in Uganda. ​

A Milestone in Aviation and Tourism Development

Emirates’ twenty-five-year journey with Uganda exemplifies the airline’s role in driving connectivity and tourism growth across Africa. When Emirates launched its Uganda service in March 2000, flights operated thrice weekly via Nairobi using Airbus A330-200 aircraft. Now, the carrier operates daily direct flights using the larger Boeing 777-300ER, the only aircraft connecting Uganda internationally with a First Class cabin.

The airline’s steady expansion reflects its commitment to understanding market potential. In 2007, the route became fully direct, solidifying Entebbe’s position as one of Emirates’ most important African destinations. The airline later upgraded its service in 2015 to the 777-200LR before transitioning to the flagship 777-300ER that serves the route today, delivering increased capacity and improved passenger comfort. ​

Strengthening Uganda’s Global Tourism Profile

Emirates’ partnership with the Uganda Tourism Board (UTB) has been integral to boosting inbound tourism over the past two years. Through joint campaigns highlighting Uganda’s world-class natural attractions, such as Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, Murchison Falls, and the Rwenzori Mountains, the collaboration has promoted the country as a premier eco- and adventure tourism destination.

Since January 2025, passenger traffic on the Dubai–Entebbe route has grown by sixteen percent, with the majority of visitors connecting from key global markets including the United States, China, India, the United Kingdom, and Thailand. Uganda’s accessibility to international audiences through Dubai’s global hub has also supported its positioning as a safari and conference destination for Middle Eastern, European, and Asian travellers. ​

Investing in Uganda’s Future

Beyond connecting destinations, Emirates has played an active role in corporate social responsibility initiatives within Uganda. In 2024, the airline’s “Dubai 7s for Good” programme raised UGX 587 million (USD one hundred fifty-five thousand) to improve educational and sports facilities at North Road Primary School in Mbale. The project included building a new rugby pitch, installing sixteen solar-powered water stations, donating sports gear, and supporting environmental sustainability through community engagement.

These projects highlight the airline’s commitment to local development and its role as a corporate citizen in Uganda, simultaneously strengthening goodwill and building long-term partnerships with local stakeholders. ​

Showcasing Emirates’ Four-Class Boeing 777

Celebrating this milestone, Emirates operated a one-off flight to Entebbe on its four-class refurbished Boeing 777-300ER, part of the airline’s USD five billion cabin retrofit programme. The aircraft features Emirates’ new First Class Suites, Business Class, Premium Economy, and Economy Class, offering passengers in Uganda the latest innovations in in-flight luxury and design.

The static tour at Entebbe International Airport allowed VIP guests, including Uganda’s Minister of Works and Transport, General Edward Katumba Wamala, and Fred Bamwesigye, Director General of the Uganda Civil Aviation Authority, to explore the aircraft’s updated interiors. From fine-dining settings in Premium Economy to the exquisite lie-flat comfort of First Class, the unveiling signified a preview of the next generation of Emirates services that will gradually expand across global destinations, Uganda included. ​

Collaboration Driving Connectivity

As of October 2025, the Dubai-Entebbe corridor is served by three airlines, Emirates, flydubai, and Uganda Airlines, offering a combined total of twenty weekly flights. Emirates remains the only carrier offering premium First Class cabins, while flydubai provides supplementary frequencies via Dubai Al-Maktoum International Airport. Together, these carriers have strengthened Uganda’s air links with the Middle East, facilitating tourism, trade, and diaspora travel.

The route’s growing performance also supports the broader vision of Emirates to enhance regional connectivity between Africa and Asia, leveraging Dubai’s global status as an aviation nexus. The airline continues to invest in Africa, expanding routes and capacity to meet the continent’s rapidly growing demand for air travel and positioning itself as a key enabler of economic exchange. ​

Sustainability and Future Footprint

Emirates’ long-term vision for Uganda extends beyond capacity growth. The airline is investing heavily in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) partnerships, renewable energy projects, and eco-friendly flight operations. As part of a dollar two hundred million investment commitment, Emirates is advancing research into sustainable propulsion and refining technologies, aligning with the UAE’s “Year of Sustainability” initiative. These efforts underscore the carrier’s pledge to balance environmental accountability with progress in global aviation.

With continuing fleet renewal and upgrades, Uganda will soon join other destinations served by Emirates’ next-generation aircraft and enhanced service offerings, ensuring that Entebbe remains an integral part of the airline’s international portfolio. ​",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/emirates-4.jpeg,N,,2025-10-18 18:56:30.089728

In a draft plan issued in June, the department identified the bio-jet fuel as the best solution for reducing aviation emissions.
But the aviation industry says electric airplane technology is limited and that the best tool is bio-jet fuel, known in industry parlance as sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF.

The teens had objected to a draft plan to use the fuel – the airplane equivalent of bio-diesel – as a tool for implementing the settlement, which requires the state to eliminate all carbon emissions related to transportation in Hawaiʻi by 2045.

The settlement involves all forms of transportation, but aviation is the biggest problem. Interisland air travel produces more than 50% of Hawaiʻi’s transportation emissions, and there is no existing technology to cut that to zero.

The state’s plan follows litigation that started in 2022 when a dozen teenagers represented by Earthjustice and Our Children’s Trust sued the state, citing their right to a clean and healthful environment.

The suit also called for the department to do a better job working to meet the 2045 deadline, which was previously adopted by the Legislature and mandated by statute.

Gov. Josh Green settled with the teens to fanfare in June 2024.

The settlement called for the Department of Transportation to create a plan to meet the 2045 deadline. In a draft plan issued in June, the department identified the bio-jet fuel as the best solution for reducing aviation emissions. The teen plaintiffs objected, saying the bio-jet fuel wasn’t 100% carbon-free and carried other negative environmental impacts. Instead, they said the state should focus on electric airplanes.

But the aviation industry says electric airplane technology is limited and that the best tool is bio-jet fuel, known in industry parlance as sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. The industry says SAF produces 50%-80% less carbon than regular jet fuel.

Last week, the Department of Transportation issued a final plan citing the use of SAF as its main strategy for aviation. The plan — which is part of an ongoing deliberative process that a panel of young residents will be able to participate in — cites a collaboration of the U.S. departments of transportation, energy and agriculture to produce enough SAF by 2050 to replace all traditional jet fuel used in the U.S. The department also said it will support a tax credit for SAF production in Hawaiʻi.

While the department’s final plan calls for numerous airport and air ground service changes to reduce emissions, such as buying more electric service vehicles and buses, the plan tacitly rejects the teens’ push for electric planes. The plan for electric and hydrogen-powered aircraft is limited to a “high-level market study.”

Ultimately, the study says, the goal of “zero emissions” from transportation by 2045 may be unattainable. It points to aviation, large cargo vessels and trucks as the biggest challenges.

While the plan says the department’s goal is to achieve “absolute zero emissions” as soon as possible, it also says, “There are some sectors of the transportation system that will be harder to decarbonize than others, and thus there is a need for interim solutions that are designed to reduce emissions while zero-emission solutions continue to be innovated and developed.”",https://d1l18ops95qbzp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/2024/08/17124332/240816-dc-Aircraft-6909.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 18:02:08.745032

Singapur führt grüne Ticketsteuer ein – nur eine Gruppe Reisender muss nicht zahlen

Fliegen ist nicht die sauberste Art zu reisen, das dürfte allen klar sein. Um die Flugemissionen einzudämmen, greift in Singapur, einem der Drehkreuze des internationalen Flugverkehrs, bald eine neue Ticketsteuer.

So unterschiedlich können die Entwicklungen sein: Nachdem vor wenigen Monaten Ryanair Schlagzeilen machte, weil die Airline heimlich die Buchungsoption auf Emissionsausgleich gestrichen hatte – niemand habe sie genutzt, so die Begründung –, geht es in Singapur in die andere Richtung.

Am 14. Oktober hat das Parlament des Stadtstaates der Schaffung einer neuen Ticketsteuer zugestimmt, die ab 2026 viele Reisende betreffen wird. Die Einnahmen aus der neuen Steuer sollen direkt in einen Fonds fließen, aus dem der zentrale Einkauf von nachhaltigem Kerosin – Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) – finanziert werden soll.

Durch dieses umweltfreundlichere Kerosin, das aus erneuerbaren Rohstoffen wie Pflanzenölen oder Abfallstoffen hergestellt wird, sollen die CO2-Emissionen im Flugverkehr drastisch gesenkt werden. Singapur will damit nicht nur seine Klimaziele erreichen, sondern auch zu einem Vorreiter in der Luftfahrtbranche werden.

Im kommenden Jahr wird die neue Steuer in Kraft treten. Fluglinien werden dann verpflichtet sein, mindestens ein Prozent SAF zu tanken. Bis 2030 soll der Anteil auf drei bis fünf Prozent steigen.

Singapur mit neuer Ticketsteuer – Transitreisende bleiben verschont

Nur bei einer Gruppe Reisender macht Singapur eine Ausnahme: Transitreisende, die für die nationale Fluggesellschaft Singapore Airlines eine wichtige Einnahmequelle darstellen, sind von der Steuer befreit. Wer in Singapur also nur umsteigt und den Flughafen nicht verlässt, der kann die zusätzlichen Kosten künftig umgehen.

""The Straits Times"", eine Tageszeitung aus Singapur, schlüsselt auf, wie die Steuer je nach Flugdistanz gestaffelt werden soll. Die Angaben gehen demnach auf die Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) zurück:

Der Singapore Changi Airport (SIN) fungiert als globales Drehkreuz zwischen Asien, Australien, Europa, dem Nahen Osten und Nordamerika. Er wurde mehrfach als ""bester Flughafen der Welt"" ausgezeichnet und fertigte im vergangenen Jahr rund 68 Millionen Passagiere und circa 366.000 Starts und Landungen ab. In Bezug auf Passagiervolumen liegt er auf dem vierten Platz der internationalen Flughäfen.","https://www.watson.de/imgdb/1291/Z1200,675/1052507181874222",N,,2025-10-18 19:57:06.837373

If all goes to plan, Magnifica Air could become what JSX pioneered on a smaller scale, a new class of air travel for those who believe flying should still feel special.","A new American airline is taking shape with an ambitious plan to bridge the gap between private jet exclusivity and first-class commercial travel.

Magnifica Air, a Florida-based startup, officially unveiled its concept at the 2025 NBAA-BACE Convention in Las Vegas last week, and if all goes according to plan, the carrier could begin flying passengers by late 2027.

The company’s mission is simple yet bold: to make private-jet-style travel accessible to a wider audience, offering a high-end, all-first-class experience at a fraction of the charter price. Led by CEO Wade Black, Magnifica Air will operate as a Part 121 scheduled carrier and aims to deliver what Black calls “luxury travel that is seamless, personal, and unforgettable.”

“Magnifica Air is pioneering a new space between private aviation and first-class commercial travel,” said Black. “We combine the privacy and intimacy of a private jet with the cultural relevance and operational scope of a world-class airline. This is more than transportation—it’s a movement, redefining how discerning guests experience the skies.”

Luxury Air Travel: Redefining Your Journey

Launch Plans and Fleet Details

Magnifica Air plans to launch with a fleet of six Airbus aircraft, including four A220-300s and two A321neos. The aircraft are being leased through long-term agreements with Air Lease Corporation (ALC) and Azorra, with deliveries expected to begin in early 2027.

The jets will be sent to Comlux—a Swiss completion specialist known for its work on VIP and head-of-state aircraft—for luxury cabin conversions. These modifications will include hand-crafted seating, adaptive lighting, gourmet dining, and lie-flat first-class suites.

The A220s will feature around 54 lay-flat seats and two private suites, while the A321neos will have 44–46 seats, including four private suites and a rear in-flight lounge. There will be no overhead bins, giving the cabins a spacious, minimalist look more reminiscent of a Gulfstream than a traditional airliner.

“Air Lease is pleased to lease these new Airbus A220s and A321neos to Magnifica Air and be the first to provide brand-new aircraft to the airline,” said David Beker, Executive Vice President of Air Lease Corporation. “Magnifica plans to use them to redefine luxury air travel by making the journey on our aircraft a destination itself.”

The company’s partnership with Azorra also includes the purchase of two ex-EgyptAir A220s. The first will arrive at Comlux’s Indianapolis facility in December 2025 for an 18-month fit-out process, followed by the second in early 2027. Both types will use Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines, and while Black acknowledged the previous reliability issues that led EgyptAir to retire the type, he added that the Azorra collaboration “puts us in pretty good shape.”

A Focus on Experience, Personalization, and Wellness

Magnifica’s model borrows elements from hybrid private-commercial aviation providers like JSX and Aero, but aims for a more upscale, personalized approach. Travelers will be picked up by black car service at home, greeted by name, and whisked directly to private terminals. A white-glove concierge will take luggage, and TSA-approved screening will be handled privately.

Guests will arrive just 30 minutes before departure, enjoy curated dining and wellness experiences in private lounges, and board via sprinter van or private ramp walk.

Once onboard, technology will drive personalization. Every guest’s preferences, from favorite meals and seat temperature to lighting and entertainment, will be pre-loaded into the system. Magnifica calls this the “curated journey,” where every touchpoint feels familiar and comfortable.

Upon arrival, baggage will be hand-delivered within 10–15 minutes, chauffeurs will be waiting curbside, and post-flight services will include lounge refresh opportunities and concierge follow-ups.

The airline will also debut “The Seven Club”, a membership-based loyalty program featuring Family and Corporate tiers. Members can choose among four levels—Airspace D, C, B, and A—and enjoy guaranteed fixed pricing, exclusive events, and full-service concierge access.

Sustainability as a Founding Principle

Sustainability is deeply embedded in Magnifica Air’s design philosophy. The airline will be carbon-neutral from day one, integrating over seven million gallons of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into its annual operations. It plans to start operations with a 50 percent SAF blend and achieve 100 percent SAF usage by 2030.

Beyond fuel, Magnifica will incorporate solar-powered lounges, a carbon offset program, and eventually hybrid-electric aircraft as part of its long-term fleet evolution.

“We don’t think of wellness or sustainability as add-ons,” said Black. “They are built into every layer of the Magnifica Air experience.”

The company will also introduce the world’s first commercial-scale surface purification system and a cabin air humidification system designed to help passengers feel more rested and refreshed after a flight.

Routes, Growth, and the Road Ahead

Magnifica Air expects to obtain its FAA Part 121 certificate by late 2026 and become fully operational by the third quarter of 2027. Initial routes will connect Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach, New York, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, and San Jose, with seasonal service to Napa Valley and, eventually, the Caribbean.

Pricing will reflect the exclusivity. A one-way ticket is expected to cost about twice that of a first-class fare, or roughly $20,000 to $25,000, according to Black. The airline will initially operate six to seven daily departures and expects to grow its fleet to 25 aircraft within four years.

Magnifica Air is backed by $150 million in initial capital from CIG Companies, its renewable energy-focused parent firm, and is currently in talks with additional investor groups.

For now, Magnifica plans to focus on intra-US travel.

“The temptation to fly internationally first provides additional complexity,” Black explained. “We will start domestically, build our program here, and grow from there.”

Magnifica’s long-term vision includes 50 aircraft and a mix of scheduled flights, VIP charters, and curated experience trips tied to major cultural and sporting events like Art Basel and Formula 1.

With predictive safety analytics, a “Collaborative Just Culture” for employees, and one spare aircraft for every four in service, Black says the airline is “designed for resilience and consistency.”

And while others have tried to launch luxury carriers before, he believes Magnifica Air’s foundation is stronger. “Previous entrants weren’t properly capitalized,” he said. “We are.”

Magnifica Air Will Give the Ultra-Premium Segment a Brand New Way to Fly

Magnifica Air is positioning itself as a hybrid between Gulfstream comfort and Delta reliability, blending high-touch hospitality with large-aircraft economics. Its promise is not just to move passengers from city to city, but to make the journey itself the destination.

In that sense, Magnifica Air draws obvious comparisons to JSX, another US operator that has carved out a niche with private-terminal service and crowd-free flying. But while JSX uses converted Embraer regional jets seating 30 passengers, Magnifica is taking a different route by using larger Airbus A220s and A321neos with spacious cabins that allow for lie-flat seating, private suites, and dedicated lounges on board.

CEO Wade Black believes this difference in scale and design will set Magnifica apart. “I’ve always felt like smaller regional jets weren’t the right platform for what we’re trying to do,” he said during a press briefing at the 2025 NBAA-BACE Convention in Las Vegas. “Space is part of the experience. You can’t deliver true luxury in a cabin that feels tight.”

By marrying the comfort and personalization of private aviation with the operational scope of a major airline, Magnifica Air aims to occupy a new space in the US market: one that sits above first class but below private charter, appealing to travelers who value privacy, efficiency, and indulgence in equal measure.

You can follow the carrier’s journey to launch via the Magnifica Air website.

If all goes to plan, Magnifica Air could become what JSX pioneered on a smaller scale, a new class of air travel for those who believe flying should still feel special.

Why Will Split Scimitar Winglets Work For Delta?","One of the world's most iconic carriers, Delta Air Lines, continues to invest in its aircraft capabilities and performance. The Atlanta-based carrier favors Split Scimitar Wingletson its Boeing 737-800 and 737-900ER airplanes. This is through a partnership with Avition Partners Boeing (also known as APB), which develops an upgrade to the current APB ubiquitous Blended Winglet.

The move is expected to improve not only overall fuel efficiency but also deliver savings in the overall consumption of aviation jet fuel and improve the carriers' operational efficiency. Delta already operates one of the largest airline fleets in the world and has an extensive network of domestic and international flights from its various US hubs.

APB Winglet Products At Delta

The decision to add Split Scimitar Winglets to the carrier's 737 family of aircraft comes at a time when the airline had already installed the APB winglet products on a range of its current fleet, albeit the ubiquitous Blended Winglets. These are currently flying on the Boeing 737-800, 737-900ER, 757-200, 757-300, and Boeing 767-300ER.

Currently, the ubiquitous Blended Winglets are a widespread wingtip device, which is common across most modern aircraft. These winglets support a smooth transition across the wing while reducing drag. This provides improved fuel efficiency and, as a result, adds additional range for the aircraft.

As a comparison, Split Scimitar Winglets feature both an upward and downward pointing fin, which creates a weaker vortex on the wing tip, resulting in improved fuel efficiency, reduced drag, and, as a result, a significant reduction in the overall carbon emissions of each flight.

Ubiquitous Blended Winglets

These are designed with one upward fin and are a common sight on popular aircraft around the world, including the Boeing 737, 757, and 767. The design is smooth and features curved extensions that blend right onto the wing's edge. These have been engineered to reduce drag by reducing the formation of the airplane's wingtip vortices. These vortices are swirling air masses that create aircraft drag.

The smooth design allows a more aerodynamic aircraft, which has been shown to increase the operating aircraft's fuel efficiency, which, as a collective result, will save airlines billions of dollars in annual operating costs. Not only will they save airlines in their pocket, but also ensure the plane's longitudinal and directional stability, which allows the aircraft to handle smoother landings, especially in wild weather such as high winds.

The Ubiquitous Blended Winglets were first introduced in the early 2000s and have been installed and adopted on aircraft around the world. Developed by Aviation Partners, the manufacturer first installed these onto the 737, and subsequently, they are now a feature on new aircraft at the assembly line, but can also be retrofitted onto existing aircraft.

Split Scimitar Winglets

First certified in 2014, Aviation Partners' joint venture with Boeing allowed a blended winglet design, which was first offered on the 737NG. Its success led to similar designs being developed for the 757 and 767. The split scimitar is designed with an aerodynamically shaped cap, with a ventral strake that extends downwards. This is proven to save more fuel, add additional range, and even increase in overall payload.

The dual-blade design is unlike normal standard winglets, given its upward and downward blades that optimize airflow. The design allows the plane to create a weaker vortex, lowering the overall drag of the airplane. This has resulted in increased fuel savings, as planes are shown to lower fuel burn by 1.6% to 2.2% per aircraft. This enhanced performance stimulates fuel savings for airlines, given their increased payload and better operational performance.

Many of the world's largest airlines have already adopted these winglet designs, with Europe's largest budget carrier, Ryanair, being one of the biggest adopters of the split scimitar winglet. Other airlines, such as United Airlines and Qantas, have also led to the retrofit of these on existing aircraft, while accepting new deliveries of planes with these already installed. Aeromexico also has the Split Scimitar winglets on its Boeing 737-800 fleet.

Other Carriers' Adoption Of The Split Scimitar Winglet

United Airlines invested in the split scimitar winglet due to the attraction of increased fuel efficiency, which would, as a result, mean lower operational costs. The design provides around 2% of fuel savings, and is fully implemented across the carrier's 737, 757, and 767 fleet. The lower emissions mean that these planes are now more fuel-efficient, improving the airline's carbon footprint.

Qantas Airways, the flag carrier of Australia, also opted for the split scimitar in a bid to improve its fuel burn across its 737-800 aircraft fleet. The significant savings expected from these will lead to a significant annual fuel saving for the airline's balance sheet. The carrier program of work to install the split scimitar winglet at Qantas is expected to run through until some stage in 2026.

This retrofit at Qantas will see the fleet of its narrowbody Boeing 737s have its winglets gradually replaced, cementing these popular aircraft into the next decade of operations. The red-tailed airline is fitting the winglets on all 23 of its Boeing 737-800s. These aircraft are deployed on domestic routes, while also providing capacity on short-haul international services such as to New Zealand, Indonesia, and other South Pacific nations.

Why Will Split Scimitar Winglets Work For Delta?

Atlanta-based Delta is investing in the development and installation of split scimitar winglets, in a bid to not only help improve the fuel efficiency of its Boeing 737 aircraft, but also lower the airline's carbon footprint. These winglets achieve improved operational efficiency due to their design being reshaped in the traditional blended design. Reduction in drag is a big factor for airlines being able to improve operational handling, as high-pressure air spills onto the lower pressure of the tip.

This creates vortices that sap energy from the jet, but the downward strakes weaken these vortices, so, compared to blended winglets, this design is far superior. With Delta looking to improve its efficiency, this also supports its goal of reducing its carbon emissions, reminding the industry that it remains committed to finding ways to develop cleaner, greener ways to fly. Delta has committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and is striving to do so through the initiatives detailed below.

The maximized efficiency produces long-haul savings, with the airplanes being able to operate longer flights, which is why we are now seeing the carrier introduce the 737-900ER and 737-800 on longer services. Given that fuel is a major operating cost for airlines, these improvements result in billions of dollars shaved off carriers' yearly fuel bill.

What's Next?

While Delta partnered with Aviation Partners in 2015, the latest move to acquire additional APB winglet products is evident in the carrier's dedication to ensuring sustainable air travel. There is a solid environmental argument for this investment, with the winglets reducing overall fuel consumption on any aircraft that has the split scimitar or even blended winglet fitted. Delta Air Lines is one of the world's largest airlines and one of America's 'Big Three' carriers.

The new partnership will see benefits that not only trickle to the airline's bottom line, but also to the passengers' tickets. Understanding the economics of fuel reduction and optimized performance should result in lower operating costs for the airline, meaning cheaper airfares for travelers.

The split scimitar winglet will see Delta reduce its overall per passenger emission while improving the overall onboard experience, not just in feel-good factor, but also lower the effects of strong jet streams and air vortices that can affect the enjoyment of the flight, but also reduce the amount of carbon emissions that the aircraft would have once produced when carrying more drag.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/blended-winglets-are-great-but-delta-air-lines-thinks-these-winglets-are-better.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-18 14:56:36.829724

Ini adalah langkah teknologi dan lingkungan yang cukup berani di tengah upaya global pengurangan emisi.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) adalah bahan bakar pesawat yang dibuat dari sumber non-fosil seperti :

minyak goreng bekas (used cooking oil),

limbah pertanian,

lemak hewan,

biomassa, atau bahkan

karbon daur ulang dari atmosfer (melalui teknologi carbon capture).

Berbeda dari avtur konvensional yang berasal dari minyak bumi, SAF dapat mengurangi emisi karbon hingga 80% selama siklus hidupnya, tergantung pada bahan baku dan proses produksinya.

Detail Informasi :

Pertamina, perusahaan energi milik negara, sudah mulai memproduksi SAF dari minyak goreng bekas (used cooking oil/UCO) dan merencanakan konversi dua kilang agar kapasitas produksinya naik.

Pemerintah menyusun regulasi untuk implementasi awal 1% SAF pada 2026, dengan target peningkatan bertahap menjadi hingga 5% pada 2035.

Potensi produksi UCO di Indonesia cukup besar: diperkirakan 3-4 juta kiloliter per tahun.

Mengapa Ini Penting :

Teknologi & Lingkungan: Penggunaan SAF merupakan integrasi teknologi energi baru dan pengurangan emisi untuk sektor penerbangan yang selama ini sulit dikurangi.

Industri dan Produksi Lokal: Pemanfaatan UCO sebagai bahan baku membuka peluang ekonomi baru, meningkatkan nilai tambah limbah, serta memperkuat rantai industri domestik.

Posisi Indonesia di Kancah Global: Langkah ini menunjukkan kesiapan Indonesia untuk masuk dalam arus teknologi energi bersih dan menjadi bagian dari solusi global perubahan iklim.

Kesiapan Infrastruktur & Regulasi: Regulasi baru dan konversi kilang menunjukkan bahwa aspek teknologi dan kebijakan sedang digarap bersamaan — bukan hanya janji tapi juga tindakan.

Tantangan dan Catatan :

Menerapkan SAF tinggi-teknologi masih menghadapi kendala seperti harga produksi, efisiensi proses, dan regulasi yang siap pakai.

Meski potensi UCO besar, logistik pengumpulan, pengolahan, dan standar mutu SAF harus dijaga agar kualitasnya layak untuk penerbangan.

Industri penerbangan dan maskapai harus bersiap dengan infrastruktur baru (misalnya, penyimpanan, distribusi SAF) dan perubahan operasional.

Kenaikan dari 1% ke target 5% hingga 2035 menunjukkan bahwa ini adalah perjalanan panjang, bukan solusi instan.

Langkah untuk menerapkan 1% SAF pada 2026 adalah langkah teknologi strategis yang menggabungkan inovasi energi, lingkungan, dan industri. Meski masih banyak tantangan, ini memberi sinyal bahwa Indonesia tidak hanya menjadi pengguna teknologi, tetapi juga bisa menjadi pionir di kawasan untuk penerapan teknologi “bersih” di sektor penerbangan.(FA)",https://ifakta.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2648.jpeg,N,,2025-10-18 15:56:47.688281

The Bigger Picture for India’s Aviation India’s aviation market is growing faster than almost any other in the world.","‍NEW DELHI —IndiGo (6E), India’s largest airline by fleet and market share, has placed a firm order for 30 additional Airbus A350-900 aircraft, strengthening its commitment to long-haul international operations. The deal follows an earlier order for 30 A350s placed in April 2024, effectively doubling the airline’s total wide-body backlog to 60 aircraft.

The agreement converts a Memorandum of Understanding signed earlier this year into a confirmed purchase. With this, IndiGo becomes one of the largest future A350 operators in Asia, positioning itself for an international expansion that goes far beyond its familiar regional routes.

A Clear Shift Beyond Domestic

For nearly two decades, IndiGo built its success on the strength of short-haul and domestic efficiency. Its fleet of over 370 Airbus A320neo and A321neo aircraft has made it one of the world’s largest single-aisle operators. But this latest order shows that the airline is no longer content being only a regional carrier.

The A350-900, with its long range and efficiency, gives IndiGo the capability to fly nonstop to Europe, Australia, and even North America, all key future markets as India’s outbound travel demand continues to rise. According to Airbus, the aircraft’s advanced aerodynamics and next-generation engines allow a 25% reduction in fuel burn and CO₂ emissions compared to previous-generation wide-bodies.

Words from the Top

Speaking about the deal, IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers said that finalizing this additional order is “a strong confirmation of our belief in India’s aviation potential.” He described that “converting the MoU into a firm order reflects confidence in the future of Indian aviation and strengthens its long-haul strategy.”

Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, Airbus Executive Vice President of Sales for Commercial Aircraft, called the announcement “a testament to IndiGo’s confidence in the A350 platform.” He highlighted how the aircraft’s efficiency and comfort make it a perfect fit for the airline’s upcoming long-haul phase.

Backstory

IndiGo first made headlines in April 2024 when it placed its initial order of 30 A350-900s, marking its first step into the wide-body market. Those aircraft are due for delivery beginning mid-2027, intended to launch the carrier’s first direct long-haul routes.

The airline’s history with Airbus goes back to its founding in 2006, when it placed a record order for 100 A320s even before operating its first flight. It continued its massive single-aisle expansion with a 250-aircraft order in 2015 and a 500-aircraft deal in 2023, which remains the largest single aircraft order in aviation history.

Now, with the A350 program, 6E is clearly preparing for a new phase. The combination of A321XLRs and A350-900s will give it both medium and long-range flexibility to reach new destinations across continents.

The Bigger Picture for India’s Aviation

India’s aviation market is growing faster than almost any other in the world. In 2024 alone, more than 160 million domestic passengers were recorded, while international traffic rose sharply as more Indians began traveling abroad for business and leisure.

This latest order ties in well with the government’s “Vision 2047” plan that aims to position India as a major global aviation hub. With the A350s, 6E can finally take on the long-haul game — going head-to-head with the big Middle Eastern players that have long owned the India–Europe and India–US corridors.

For Airbus, India has turned into a key pillar in its global strategy. The planemaker has been steadily pumping investments into the country’s aviation ecosystem, from local suppliers to training centers and pilot development programs, many of which play straight into IndiGo’s long-term growth story.

Aircraft Details & Sustainability Goals

The Airbus A350-900 features a typical two-class layout seating between 300 and 350 passengers. It’s equipped with Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines—among the world’s most efficient large turbofans—and has a range of around 8,000 nautical miles.

The aircraft is also fully certified to operate on up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) today, with ongoing efforts toward 100% SAF capability by 2030. IndiGo, like other global carriers, has pledged to gradually increase its SAF usage over the coming decade.

While the airline hasn’t yet disclosed its cabin configuration or branding strategy for the A350 fleet, industry speculation points toward a full-service long-haul division under the IndiGo umbrella — possibly with premium seating layouts unlike its all-economy narrow-body jets.

Looking Ahead

The first of IndiGo’s A350-900s is expected to enter service in 2027, marking the airline’s official step into the wide-body space.

While Airbus will deliver the remaining aircraft gradually over the coming years, 6E hasn’t yet announced its first long-haul destinations. Many in the industry expect them to start by exploring routes into Europe and East Asia, with further expansion to North America possible as the fleet and infrastructure mature.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c26eeea7cdaa706d97a75c/68f39798cd5ea2cef1920279_IndiGo%20Orders%2030%20A350-900s.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 10:56:18.248530

He emphasized that green buildings and green transport are key pillars in Vietnam’s green economic growth strategy. Beyond reducing emissions and saving resources, they also foster technological innovation, improve living standards, and enhance national competitiveness.

In both 2024 and 2025, Vietnam saw strong growth in the number of certified green buildings and eco-friendly vehicles.

By the end of Q3 2025, the country had around 600 certified green buildings, totaling nearly 17 million square meters of floor space.

In transportation, Vietnam recorded 183,240 electric cars and 974 electric buses on the road.

Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City lead the nation with more than 38,400 electric cars each. The two cities also operate 317 and 507 electric buses respectively.

Other provinces such as Da Nang, Hai Phong, Thanh Hoa, and Khanh Hoa are also witnessing rapid growth, contributing to Vietnam’s green transition and sustainable development goals.

Transport sector must pivot to electric and biofuel sources

Discussing emission-reduction potential in the transport sector, Le Van Dat, Deputy Director of the Strategy and Personnel Training Academy (under the Ministry of Construction), noted that between 2014 and 2023, road transport accounted for over 85% of Vietnam’s total passenger and freight volume.

The country currently has over 7 million cars and nearly 78 million motorbikes, along with hundreds of thousands of vessels in maritime, inland waterway, and aviation sectors.

The transport industry consumes over 95% of its energy from fossil fuels and emits an estimated 45.8 million tons of CO₂ annually-second only to the industrial sector.

Under Vietnam’s third Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC 3.0), the country aims to replace traditional fuels in road transport with biofuels and electricity by 2030.

For the rail sector, electric trains are being implemented in urban areas from 2019 to 2025, while hydrogen is expected to be adopted by 2040. By 2050, diesel, electric, and hydrogen-powered locomotives are projected to account for 40%, 10%, and 50% of the total fleet respectively.

In inland waterway transport, electricity and hydrogen are expected to be introduced starting in 2035.

For aviation, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) will begin to be used from 2035, expected to supply around 10% of the sector’s total energy demand.

Vietnam must build a full green investment ecosystem

In the construction materials sector, Nguyen Thi Tam, Director of the Center for Equipment, Environment and Labor Safety (under the Institute of Building Materials), said the goal by 2030 is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 15.03%, equivalent to 23.2 million tons of CO₂.

With international support, emissions could be cut by up to 20.06%, or 30.97 million tons of CO₂.

To achieve this, the sector is adopting new technologies, utilizing waste in production, optimizing processes, and researching carbon capture innovations.

In parallel, institutional and policy tools are being developed-such as low-emission standards, carbon credit mechanisms, and the establishment of a carbon market.

Ta Duc Binh, representative of the Institute of Strategy and Policy for Agriculture and Environment (under the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment), warned that climate change is progressing at an alarming rate, requiring decisive action from policymakers and investors.

According to the World Bank, Vietnam will need around 368 billion USD by 2040 to achieve net-zero emissions.

This presents a major challenge in mobilizing capital, advancing technology, developing green infrastructure, and training a skilled workforce.

“Vietnam must rapidly complete a comprehensive green investment ecosystem-from legal frameworks and incentives to transparent monitoring systems-to lay the foundation for a prosperous and sustainable future,” Binh emphasized.",https://static-images.vnncdn.net/vps_images_publish/000001/00000Q/2025/10/17/vietnam-reaches-183000-electric-cars-as-ev-adoption-surges-9cd86ce9685549edbdb4aefde4ab1d1d-2322.jpg?width=0&s=fzqAVxojBWLsMtdmgoA8LA,N,,2025-10-18 09:01:12.354753

However, Brazil’s biofuel industry continues to face certain challenges.
These emerging biofuels represent the next frontier of Brazil’s energy strategy and are expected to play a critical role in achieving net-zero goals.
The story of Brazil’s biofuel journey is one of persistence, innovation, and vision.","Brazil has emerged as a global leader in sustainable biofuels, setting an example for countries working to decarbonize their energy systems while supporting economic growth and social development. The country’s long-standing commitment to renewable energy is rooted in decades of consistent government policies, innovation, and collaboration between the public and private sectors. Brazil’s experience, particularly with ethanol made from sugarcane and biodiesel produced from soybeans, provides valuable lessons for the world on how to build a successful and sustainable bioenergy sector.

The success of Brazil’s biofuel journey began in the 1970s, when the government launched initiatives to reduce dependence on imported oil. Over time, this evolved into a well-structured system that includes the RenovaBio program and the “Fuel of the Future Law.” These legislative frameworks have encouraged the widespread use of biofuels through financial incentives, clear regulations, and mandatory blending targets. As a result, Brazil has managed to significantly lower its carbon emissions and increase its energy security while strengthening the agricultural economy. The widespread use of flexible-fuel vehicles, which can run on either pure ethanol or a gasoline-ethanol blend, has been one of the most visible signs of success. This approach has provided consumers with affordable, low-carbon mobility options while promoting domestic renewable energy.

Brazil’s model shows how thoughtful policies can de-risk investments and create a stable business environment. Clear and consistent rules have encouraged cooperation between the government, private investors, and research institutions. This collaboration has driven innovation, leading to improvements in both production efficiency and environmental sustainability. Farmers, fuel producers, and vehicle manufacturers all play a role in this integrated system, ensuring that biofuels contribute meaningfully to national development goals.

However, Brazil’s biofuel industry continues to face certain challenges. One of the key concerns is managing land use effectively. The expansion of biofuel production must not come at the expense of food security or lead to deforestation and habitat loss. Policymakers and industry leaders must ensure that agricultural practices remain sustainable and that environmental safeguards are in place to protect sensitive ecosystems. Additionally, global fluctuations in fossil fuel prices can affect the competitiveness of biofuels. Maintaining policy stability and long-term planning is crucial to sustain investor confidence and ensure continuous progress in the sector.

Despite these challenges, Brazil is now focusing on the next generation of biofuels that promise even greater environmental and economic benefits. The country is investing in advanced technologies such as second-generation (2G) ethanol, which is produced using sugarcane straw and bagasse—agricultural residues that would otherwise go to waste. This approach not only improves resource efficiency but also helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions further. Another area of innovation is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which aims to decarbonize the aviation industry, one of the hardest sectors to electrify. These emerging biofuels represent the next frontier of Brazil’s energy strategy and are expected to play a critical role in achieving net-zero goals.

The broader lesson from Brazil’s experience is the importance of global cooperation. As countries around the world transition toward cleaner energy systems, biofuels can make a substantial contribution. Experts estimate that sustainable fuels could provide at least 20% of the world’s total energy consumption by 2050 if countries adopt supportive policies and share best practices. Brazil’s achievements demonstrate that large-scale adoption of biofuels is possible when clear policies, technological innovation, and public-private partnerships align toward common goals.

The story of Brazil’s biofuel journey is one of persistence, innovation, and vision. It shows that renewable energy can power both economic and environmental progress. By building strong sustainability standards and encouraging collaboration across nations, the global community can follow Brazil’s lead in turning climate ambition into tangible results. Brazil’s experience continues to inspire policymakers worldwide to view bioenergy not just as an alternative fuel source, but as a cornerstone of a sustainable and inclusive energy future.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pexels-photo-923953.jpeg,N,,2025-10-18 10:56:32.379825

Small-scale energy use is already practical, with melting plastic waste into fuel to heat homes complementing a modular plastic waste fuel reactor that upgrades packaging into liquid fuel cuts.
Where it Fits Hydrogen routes can be attractive near heavy transport corridors or industrial clusters that already consume hydrogen.
Hydrogen pathways are maturing, with plastic waste into hydrogen detailing catalytic routes, and the world’s first waste plastic hydrogen plant illustrating how contaminated streams become clean H₂.
Jet-range molecules are achievable quickly, as plastic waste into jet fuel methods demonstrate rapid deconstruction kinetics and plastic waste fuel reactors document controllable distillation curves for circular polymer or fuel applications.","If you have ever watched a viral clip of someone turning old packaging into liquid fuel with a microwave-style rig, you already know the hook. That do-it-yourself energy moment is real enough to spark curiosity. The bigger story, though, lives in commercial plants, refinery-ready feedstocks, and airline and shipping buyers that are already purchasing fuels made from waste carbon.

The result is a practical pathway from post-consumer plastics and even captured CO₂ to usable fuels and petrochemical feedstocks that meet industry specifications. The science behind sunlight-driven microwave-assisted pyrolysis is well documented, and it provides a friendly on-ramp to explain the mature routes the industry is scaling today.

Before we dive into the four routes that already work, you will see two patterns. First, large buyers care about specifications and reliability. Second, policy definitions decide who can claim recycling content and who earns fuel credits. Together, those two forces explain why some projects scale quickly while others stay in the lab.

Seven Fast Facts Proving Plastic-to-Fuel is Already Real

Hydrothermal plants are scaling now: Mura Technology announced a 50,000-ton-per-year Hydro-PRT® facility on Jurong Island, Singapore, positioned to process more than 60,000 tonnes of plastic waste annually as it expands.

Electrified cracking just hit a milestone: Coolbrook cracked 100 percent plastic-waste pyrolysis oil directly to ethylene and propylene at a pilot scale, while maintaining stable operation.

Conditioning trains make waste oils “cracker-ready”: Technip Energies commercialized Pure.rOil purification to remove contaminants and align boiling ranges for steam crackers.

CO₂-to-fuel is already commercial: The Kassø e-methanol plant in Denmark was inaugurated May 13, 2025, at 42,000 tonnes per year, with offtake tied to deep-sea shipping.

Aviation buyers are investing: United Airlines invested in Twelve, which produces power-to-liquid E-Jet fuel from CO₂ and water using renewable electricity.

CO₂-to-methanol deployments span multiple sites: Carbon Recycling International lists commercial and licensed projects that convert CO₂ into methanol at an industrial scale.

Frontier research is moving quickly: Recent reviews outline microwave-assisted pyrolysis fundamentals and photoreforming routes that turn plastics into hydrogen and valuable chemicals using sunlight.

Fast-conversion case studies show plastic waste turned into jet fuel in under an hour, scalable routes for plastic waste turned into hydrogen, and a bench-scale plastic waste fuel reactor that liquefies mixed streams into usable fractions.

Four Real Pathways that Already Work

Hydrothermal Conversion to Drop-In Hydrocarbons

How it Works

Hydrothermal processes expose plastics to high-temperature, high-pressure water. The supercritical water breaks long polymer chains into shorter hydrocarbons that can be refined into petrochemical feedstocks or fuel cuts. This approach tolerates mixed streams better than many catalytic routes and produces liquids that integrate into existing infrastructure.

Where it is Scaling

Mura’s Hydro-PRT plants showcase the model: site near industrial hubs, convert hard-to-recycle streams, and output stabilized liquids for downstream units. The Jurong Island project in Singapore is the latest expansion, sized at 50,000 tonnes per year with growth plans beyond 60,000 tonnes.

What Buyers Want

Refiners and petrochemical players want stable composition, tight impurity control, and predictable boiling ranges. Hydrothermal liquids can be conditioned to meet those needs, which is why you see projects co-located with crackers and refineries. For background on policy definitions that affect marketing claims, see our explainer on mass-balance rules in the European Union and the evolving U.S. regulatory posture on waste units.

Pyrolysis Oil to Steam Crackers with Electrified Cracking

How it Works

Thermal pyrolysis converts mixed plastics into a liquid commonly called pyrolysis oil. To feed that oil to a steam cracker that makes ethylene and propylene, operators must remove chlorine, oxygenates, metals, and fine solids, and in some cases trim the boiling range. Commercial purification trains now exist to perform that conditioning step.

Industrial Proof

Conditioning Is Productized: Technip Energies markets Pure.rOil, a purification platform that treats a wide range of pyrolysis oils so they can run in liquid-feed steam crackers.

Electrified Cracking Removes the Dilution Crutch: Coolbrook demonstrated cracking 100 percent plastic-waste pyrolysis oil in its RotoDynamic Reactor, delivering ethylene and propylene with stable coking behavior. That simplifies traceability and makes circular content easier to track.

Why it Matters

When cracker-grade specifications are met, pyrolysis oil can become a circular feedstock for new plastics, not just a combustion fuel. Small-scale energy use is already practical, with melting plastic waste into fuel to heat homes complementing a modular plastic waste fuel reactor that upgrades packaging into liquid fuel cuts.

Plastic-to-Hydrogen when Gas Beats Liquids

How it Works

There are multiple routes to hydrogen from plastics, including gasification with steam reforming, catalytic pyrolysis with in-situ reforming, and advanced processes that co-reform plastic-derived gases. These systems are useful when feedstocks are highly contaminated, when siting favors distributed units, or when hydrogen credits and local demand improve project economics.

Recent Signals

A growing body of 2025 literature consolidates catalysts, yields, and integration options for plastic-to-hydrogen, and field trials continue to refine performance on mixed streams. Those reviews provide mechanism diagrams and techno-economic guardrails you can cite in procurement and policy conversations.

Where it Fits

Hydrogen routes can be attractive near heavy transport corridors or industrial clusters that already consume hydrogen. Hydrogen pathways are maturing, with plastic waste into hydrogen detailing catalytic routes, and the world’s first waste plastic hydrogen plant illustrating how contaminated streams become clean H₂.

Sunlight and Electrons: The Frontier Moving from Lab to Pilot

Photoreforming With Sunlight

Researchers are rapidly improving catalysts that use sunlight and water to convert plastics into hydrogen and platform chemicals like formate and acetate in a process more commonly known as sunlight-driven microwave pyrolysis. These systems operate at low temperatures and pair naturally with renewable power. Recent reviews summarize pretreatment steps, reaction mechanisms, and stability challenges.

Electro-Routes You Should Watch

Electrified approaches, including joule-heated or plasma-assisted reforming, are being explored to co-convert plastics and CO₂ into syngas precursors for fuels. While these methods remain pre-commercial, they provide an important bridge between low-value waste streams and high-value molecules that heavy industry can use.

Who Buys, Why the Market is Growing, and What Decides the Winning Route

Selecting the right plastic-to-fuel pathway starts with knowing who will buy the output of the green e-fuels revolution and why. Marine carriers seek e-methanol that slots into port logistics, airlines fund power-to-liquid SAF to meet blend and safety rules, and petrochemicals demand cracker-grade liquids for circular polymers. With buyers defined, feedstock quality, energy prices, and policy incentives determine which technology wins in a given region, from plastic-to-hydrogen near industrial hubs to pyrolysis-to-cracker routes inside petrochemical clusters.

Shipping’s E-Methanol Momentum

Deep-sea shipping needs dense liquid fuels that move through existing logistics while meeting tougher emissions targets, which is why e-methanol is gaining traction. Denmark’s Kassø facility began commercial operations on May 13, 2025, supplying certified e-methanol produced from renewable power and captured CO₂. Early bunkering for vessels such as Laura Maersk signals real demand rather than pilot-only activity, and port infrastructure is scaling to handle methanol alongside conventional marine fuels.

What Bunkering Looks Like in Practice

At Kassø, solar-powered electrolysis pairs with biogenic CO₂ capture to synthesize methanol that is stored on site and transferred via standard bunkering hoses to container ships. Transparency on inputs and certification enables shipowners to count emissions reductions toward fleet targets, turning e-methanol into a practical decarbonization lever for ocean freight.

Aviation’s Power-to-Liquid Moves

Airlines operate under strict safety and energy-density constraints, so they are investing in power-to-liquid suppliers that make sustainable aviation fuel from CO₂ and water using renewable electricity. Investments like United Airlines backing Twelve demonstrate how carriers secure future supply, diversify beyond bio-based SAF, and push producers toward fuel specs that fit existing engines and airport fueling systems.

Jet-range molecules are achievable quickly, as plastic waste into jet fuel methods demonstrate rapid deconstruction kinetics and plastic waste fuel reactors document controllable distillation curves for circular polymer or fuel applications.

Petrochemicals Seek Circular Feed

When the objective is to make new plastics instead of combusting fuels, petrochemical buyers require cracker-grade liquids derived from waste plastics. This depends on two industrial capabilities. First, commercial oil-conditioning trains remove chlorine, oxygenates, metals, and heavy tails so the liquid meets steam-cracker requirements. Second, electrified steam-cracking pilots have shown that waste-plastic pyrolysis oil can be processed without relying on fossil diluents, which improves traceability for circular content and simplifies accounting for recycled material.

Carbon-To-Chemicals is Now a Market

Beyond fuels, carbon utilization is producing commodity chemicals. Commercial and licensed CO₂-to-methanol projects already convert point-source CO₂ into a platform molecule used in fuels and chemical manufacturing. Parallel progress in polymers shows how carbon captured from industry can reappear as polypropylene-grade outputs, tightening the loop between emissions and everyday materials.

Why Household and Enterprise Solutions Align

Decentralized systems like biodigesters cut methane at the home or community level, while energy-efficient aviation facilities reduce operational footprints across complex logistics. Both ends of the spectrum point to the same conclusion. Waste carbon becomes valuable when the conversion route fits local feedstocks, the offtake is real, and the policy framework rewards the environmental attributes that markets are willing to buy.

Regulatory Reality Check: The Rules that Pick Winners

Europe’s Mass-Balance Accounting Shapes What Counts

The European Commission launched a 2025 consultation to define how chemically recycled content in single-use plastic beverage bottles should be calculated through mass balance. This is a pivotal definition. If fuel use is excluded from recycled-content claims for bottles, projects will often favor routes that produce cracker-grade liquids for polymer loops rather than fuels. The Commission’s summary explains the accounting intent and the push for a level playing field across technologies. Review the official notice and industry briefs for the current wording and timing.

What that Means for Investors

If your revenue model depends on “recycled content” claims, mass-balance rules determine whether a given output stream qualifies. That is why companies pursuing pyrolysis-to-cracker and hydrothermal liquids often colocate with existing petrochemical assets in Europe. A conservative reading of the Commission’s consultation suggests polymer-loop outputs can be easier to credit than combusted fuels for bottle content targets. Cross-check the language before locking your product slate.

U.S. Compliance Context for Waste-to-Fuel Projects

The EPA finalized an Other Solid Waste Incineration (OSWI) rule in June 2025, effective August 29, 2025. While the rule targets incineration units, it influences how developers classify and permit certain waste-processing configurations. Developers should review the Federal Register text and EPA backgrounders to understand monitoring, emissions control, and siting implications for their specific technology stack. Start with the Federal Register entry and EPA OSWI pages for authoritative details.

Practical Takeaway on U.S. Siting

Compliance categories can shift a project’s cost structure and timeline. Teams should plan early for emissions testing, recordkeeping, and local permitting dialogues, especially when the configuration integrates thermal steps that regulators may scrutinize. Keep language precise in public communications to avoid conflating chemical recycling with incineration.

Route Selector: How To Choose the Right Sustainable Fuel Conversion Path

One rule governs everything: context decides the winner. The optimal route depends on four variables that interact locally: feedstock quality, energy price, nearby buyers, and policy definitions. When those are mapped correctly, the most efficient and sustainable pathway usually becomes obvious.

What Determines The Best Route

Feedstock: purity, polymer mix, contamination, moisture, and volume stability

Energy & Utilities: electricity price and carbon intensity, available steam, water, and heat

Offtake & Logistics: proximity to hydrogen users, steam crackers, ports, or airports

Policy & Credits: recycled-content accounting, fuel carbon intensity standards, hydrogen incentives

Start With Feedstock And End Use

Mixed, Dirty, Or Variable Streams with Local Hydrogen Demand

Choose: Plastic-to-hydrogen routes.

Why it fits: These systems tolerate contamination, can be distributed near end users, and can stack clean-hydrogen credits where they exist.

Best locations: Industrial hubs and heavy-transport corridors that already consume hydrogen for refining, chemicals, steel, or fleet fueling.

Execution tip: Secure a nearby H₂ buyer and grid-connection plan, then size the unit to match steady waste inflow and hydrogen demand.

Access To A Steam Cracker Or Petrochemical Complex

Choose: Pyrolysis-oil conditioning targeting circular polymer loops.

Why it fits: Meeting cracker specifications unlocks high-value offtake and enables verifiable recycled-content claims inside plastics supply chains.

Best locations: Chemical parks with liquid-feed crackers and utilities for pretreatment, hydrotreating, and impurity control.

Execution tip: Budget for a full conditioning train and quality assurance. Align with a cracker operator on acceptable ranges for chlorine, oxygenates, metals, and boiling curves.

Regions With Strong CO₂ Fuel Credits and Low-Cost Renewable Power

Choose: CO₂-to-e-fuels such as e-methanol for marine use or power-to-liquid SAF for aviation.

Why it fits: Policy rewards low-carbon molecules and early plants are already operating with offtake agreements from shipping and airlines.

Best locations: Grid nodes with abundant renewables, available CO₂ sources, and port or airport infrastructure.

Execution tip: Lock power purchase terms and carbon intensity baselines early. Match plant size to firm offtake and certification requirements.

Markets Where Recycled-Content Claims Are Essential

Choose: Routes that trace outputs into polymer loops rather than combustion.

Why it fits: In programs where bottle-content accounting excludes fuel use from recycled-content claims, polymer-to-polymer pathways score better.

Execution tip: Track mass-balance rules closely, align auditing and chain-of-custody systems, and coordinate communications so claims match the local standard.

Putting It All Together: A Quick Decision Flow

Is reliable H₂ demand within trucking distance and are feeds mixed or dirty → pursue plastic-to-hydrogen.

Is a steam cracker nearby with appetite for circular liquids → invest in pyrolysis-oil conditioning for polymer loops.

Is cheap, clean power available and CO₂ credits strong → develop CO₂-to-e-fuels for shipping or aviation.

Are recycled-content claims central to revenue or regulation → bias toward polymer-loop outputs and mass-balance alignment.

Use this selector as a checklist in project scoping. Map your local variables, run sensitivity on power price and policy credit values, validate offtake specifications with buyers, and the winning route will emerge with far less friction.

The Bottom Line on Waste Carbon: What Smart Buyers Know Now

Sustainability has grown up. The popular DIY clips are a useful spark, yet the real story sits in contracts, certifications, and plants that turn waste plastics and captured CO₂ into fuels and feedstocks that meet buyer specifications.

Everyday infrastructure contributes alongside corporate hubs, with Biodigesters That Recycle Household Waste lowering household emissions and Ryanair’s Eco-Friendly Hangar Facility optimizing energy use across ground operations.

Shipping is already bunkering e-methanol in Denmark. Aviation is investing in power-to-liquid suppliers to secure future SAF. Petrochemicals are conditioning pyrolysis oils and testing fully circular, electrified cracking runs.

Policymakers are defining how recycled content is counted and how waste units are permitted, which directly affects what scales first.

This ultimately signaled a decisive move into the world of long-haul flying. The airline's CEO, Pieter Elbers, ultimately said that the deal supports IndiGo's goal of becoming a global player by 2030 and aligning with India's aviation hub ambitions.

The aircraft type promises a roughly 25% lower fuel burn, operating cost, and Carbon Dioxide output than previous-generation rival jet models. The plane can also operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel, with a target of 100% currently in the works for 2030. Airbus noted impressive market growth in India, with Airbus A350 orders totaling more than 1,400 from 63 customers by September 2025.

A Deeper Look At The Specifics Of This Deal

IndiGo's firm order for a set of 30 Airbus A350-900s is set to lift its A350 backlog to 60 aircraft, and it is notable on several fronts. This order very quickly converts a Memorandum of Understanding from June, and it signals a strong conviction in the airline's decision to make a pivot into the long-haul market. IndiGo has historically been a very successful low-cost regional carrier, but this shift highlights the airline's strong interest in making an entry into the long-haul market, according to the latest reports from manufacturer Airbus.

The Airbus A350's long-range capabilities, cabin comfort, and roughly 25% advantage in terms of fuel burn make it a good choice for an airline looking to cater to a new kind of long-haul travelers. The jet's exceptional route economics and ability to operate with nearly 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel make it exceptionally capable in relation to earlier-generation competitors. The carrier will now begin the challenging part of planning which long-haul destinations it is looking to fly to.

What Is IndiGo's Plan For Entering The Long-Haul Market?

IndiGo is pursuing a sequenced and risk-managed pivot into long-haul travel. This is relatively unique for an airline that operates on a low-cost model, given the typical higher expenses associated with long-haul intercontinental flights. The airline is starting by layering partnerships across its network to offer diverse one-stop access to destinations across Europe. The airline is then looking to wet-lease Boeing 777-300ER models to build up experience operating services between Delhi, Mumbai, and Istanbul.

Next, IndiGo added a small ""Stretch"" premium cabin on Airbus A321neos to test paid upsell potential and condition customers for two-class services. The airline's fleet architecture is based on a true long-haul model with some future Airbus A321XLR jets that will enable flights on long and thin routes. This will soon be followed by Airbus A350-900s starting in 2027, with this new order bringing the total number of airframes to 60.

The airline's network strategy will leverage Delhi and Mumbai as super-feed hubs, opening up European services first before broader Asia-Pacific and North America moves. Codeshares also fill gaps until the Airbus A350 arrives to provide scale and long-range capabilities. There are some risks associated with the execution of this long-haul fleet strategy. This includes improved slot access at primary gateways, and potential delivery delays could also slow down the airline's planned timeline.

What Does All Of This Mean For Passengers?

Passengers will now have access to more nonstop flights from India to Europe. Later expansion plans call for the airline to add flights to Asia-Pacific destinations and to North America, which will further expand the carrier's long-haul reach. Passengers traveling with IndiGo on long-haul services can anticipate competitive base fares, but an unbundled model that will require them to pay for pretty much everything extra.

In the near term, one-stop connectivity will continue to improve via the airline's partners. Medium-haul routes will use the Airbus A321XLR that features ""Stretch"" seats offering extra comfort. The Airbus A350 does offer top-of-the-line cabin comfort, so its introduction to service will mark an improvement over the 777-300ERs, which it will initially use.

The airline will operate two principal hubs using this aircraft. The airline will center its long-haul service network out of Indira Gandhi International Airport (DEL) in Delhi and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (BOM) in Mumbai.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/indigo-a350.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-18 03:56:15.115056

“South Dakota is a very difficult place to do business,” Gruber told South Dakota Searchlight on Friday.
It wouldn’t be a standalone ethanol plant, he said, but it could be a jet fuel plant that uses corn oil or ethanol, or be used as a chemical production plant.
Gruber sees a future where 70 of the nation’s approximately 180 ethanol plants use designs like Gevo’s to convert to jet fuel production.
The specter of eminent domain sparked landowner opposition, litigation and political activism in South Dakota, leading to the ban.","The leader of the company that abandoned its immediate plans to build a $2.6 billion ethanol-based jet fuel plant in Lake Preston said Friday that South Dakota is no longer a friendly place to do business.

In 2022, Gevo CEO Patrick Gruber stood alongside South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden, then the lieutenant governor, at the ceremonial groundbreaking for the project, billed as the largest economic development project in state history.

This week, Gruber and his Colorado-based company announced plans for a smaller jet fuel facility at an ethanol plant in Richardton, North Dakota.

Gevo bought the plant a year ago in the wake of South Dakota pushback on a carbon sequestration pipeline that was critical to the company’s Lake Preston business plan.

“South Dakota is a very difficult place to do business,” Gruber told South Dakota Searchlight on Friday. “Everything is oppositional. North Dakota is a breath of fresh air.”

Gruber said his company still hopes to build something on the 200-odd acres it owns in Kingsbury County at some point in the future. It wouldn’t be a standalone ethanol plant, he said, but it could be a jet fuel plant that uses corn oil or ethanol, or be used as a chemical production plant.

Gruber sees a future where 70 of the nation’s approximately 180 ethanol plants use designs like Gevo’s to convert to jet fuel production. Demand is growing, he said, and the U.S. can’t keep up with the petroleum-based refineries it has.

That’s long-term, though. Whether the Lake Preston site is a part of that conversation or is used for another offshoot of Gevo’s operations is also a ways off.

At this point, after watching opposition to the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline drive policy changes over the past three years, Gruber said he’s wary of engaging South Dakota leaders.

In 2022, he said, there was strong support in state leadership for both the pipeline and Gevo’s Net Zero-1 complex in Kingsbury County.

Then the political winds shifted.

“Having lived through the change, I’m not doing that again,” Gruber said.

Carbon sequestration drives business

Summit Carbon Solutions had hoped to gather carbon dioxide from ethanol plants across multiple states and deliver it via underground pipe to a site in North Dakota for sequestration. In doing so, the company would cash in on federal carbon capture tax credits.

Gevo, were it to build its operations in Lake Preston and connect to that line, would be able to lower the carbon emissions of its jet fuel, boosting its value in certain markets.

Sustainable jet fuel developer moves priority from SD to ND amid Summit pipeline delays

Gevo’s North Dakota plant sits atop the same formation that would be used to sequester carbon by Summit. This year, Gevo’s been pumping the carbon from that plant underground and selling carbon credits to other companies that want to offset their carbon footprint. Sequestering carbon also lowers an ethanol plant’s carbon score, so Gevo can sell it for more in some areas.

Gruber said the company can also sell carbon to fossil fuel companies in North Dakota’s oilfields for use in enhanced oil recovery — pumping gas underground to force more crude oil toward a well.

“We did good by buying that plant,” Gruber told Searchlight.

Summit, meanwhile, is in limbo. Gov. Rhoden signed a bill banning the use of eminent domain by carbon pipeline companies this year. Eminent domain is the legal process by which land access can be obtained for use in projects that benefit the public, with compensation for landowners determined by a court. The specter of eminent domain sparked landowner opposition, litigation and political activism in South Dakota, leading to the ban.

The Public Utilities Commission denied Summit’s permit application twice, but the company vowed to reapply.

Issue splits governor candidates

On Thursday, Rhoden said he’s glad to hear that Gevo may still build in South Dakota. He also said signing the eminent domain ban for carbon pipelines was the right thing to do in response to citizen concerns, and that Summit has a chance to “reset” its plans and work with landowners.

Rhoden has not announced if he’ll be a candidate to keep his job in 2026, but he’s spent much of his first year in office on an “Open for Opportunity” tour to meet business leaders across the state.

South Dakota Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, was the first Republican to announce his intention to run for governor. He’s been among the loudest opponents of the carbon pipeline.

Hansen said he’s not saddened to hear about Gevo’s shift to North Dakota. He pointed to a $12.2 million tax rebate authorized for Gevo by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development in 2023 and said companies ought to be able to thrive in South Dakota without incentives.

“This is yet another example of what I’ve been fighting against: politicians and bureaucrats in the Governor’s Office of Economic Development getting duped by green-energy and other scams — abusing so-called ‘economic development’ programs to hand out our tax dollars to out-of-state corporations.”

Hansen said South Dakotans “want our money back,” and that “corporate welfare waste” would end if he were elected governor.

Gruber said Friday, however, that Gevo never used its tax rebate, because it was predicated on building the Net Zero-1. Since that hasn’t happened, “we have not taken any money from South Dakota.” Josie Harms, Rhoden’s spokeswoman, confirmed that Gevo hasn’t collected any state money, and that it has paid sales taxes on anything it purchased in South Dakota to prepare the site.

Nothing has been done to the land for about two years.

Governor race exposes divergent paths on economic development among South Dakota Republicans

Another Republican candidate for governor, Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden, also leaned in on opposition to publicly funded economic development incentives in his statement on Gevo. He said companies that want to locate in South Dakota should “share our values” and be able to “succeed without politicians putting their fingers on the scale.”

“As governor, I will attract businesses, large and small, who will come here on fair terms,” Doeden said in a statement. “Businesses that move here should do so on their own two feet without demanding hundreds of millions in state subsidies or abusing residents in the process.”

Republican U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, who’s also declared his candidacy for governor in 2026, has talked recently about wanting to make South Dakota’s business climate more friendly again. This week, he sent out a press release on a “Data Centers Done Right” initiative, which he said would incentivize their placement in South Dakota and make the state “be a national leader in the AI revolution.”

Hansen and Doeden each responded to that announcement by saying they’re opposed to tax breaks.

Johnson, in a statement on the Gevo situation, said anti-development attitudes are the reason the state lost ground in the latest iteration of CNBC’s “America’s Top States for Business” rankings.

“Unfortunately, this isn’t the only project looking to leave South Dakota,” Johnson wrote. “Our state has slid down the rankings to the 35th best state for business. South Dakota has many strengths, but if we are going to meet our potential, we’ll need vision and a plan.”

Robert Arnold, the only declared Democratic candidate for governor, said South Dakotans have made their feelings on the carbon pipeline clear. But he also said he’d like to see Gevo follow through and build in South Dakota.

“I hope that we haven’t turned this industry completely away from us and we can negotiate a deal down the road,” Arnold said in a statement.

Lake Preston anticipated loss

Lake Preston Mayor Donna Bumann said pipeline opposition wasn’t an issue in her community.

“For the farmers in our area that Summit has connected with, it’s been quite positive,” Bumann said. “I realize that’s not the same in other areas.”

Gevo trumpets cash on hand, growth potential for sustainable jet fuel in earnings call

Bumann said her community had embraced Gevo and the benefits its proposed jet fuel plant promised. In a presentation offered to investors last year, the company included a slide that said Net Zero-1 would return $170 million annually to the South Dakota economy, create 1,300 short-term and 100 long-term jobs, partner with universities to promote science education and draw graduates to its operations, and pay area farmers a premium for corn.

“We are hopeful that, in due time, circumstances will make it possible for Gevo to move forward,” Bumann said.

Kingsbury County Commission Chairman Kyle Lee wasn’t surprised by the news, either.

“Once the state said that they weren’t going to allow for Summit to do any eminent domain, I think we knew that was going to end up being the straw that broke the camel’s back,” Lee said.

Net Zero-1’s footprint would’ve included an ethanol plant, a plant to turn that ethanol into jet fuel, and a wind farm proposed by a company called Zero6. It also spurred East River Electric Cooperative to invest in a switching station near the Gevo site, meant to help service the company’s power needs.

This month, however, Zero6 pulled its application for interconnection from the Southwest Power Pool’s queue. The Southwest Power Pool manages the wholesale power market for the central U.S.

Chris Studer of East River Electric said the cooperative will still build its switching station and use it to serve existing customers.

“We weren’t just building lines to serve Gevo,” Studer said, but he added that the upgrades will ready the area for any large-scale industrial project that might come along.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Gevo-1-e1683764863266.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 01:56:08.709546

Are we seeing a broader crystallisation phase for the IP Group portfolio?","IP Group PLC (LSE:IPO) CEO Greg Smith joined Proactive to discuss the company’s strategic outlook, recent exits, and high-potential investments.

Topics include future royalty streams from obesity drug programs, portfolio realisations, and IP Group’s backing of clean tech innovator OXCCU.

Here, we take a closer look at what was said.

Proactive: Greg, very good to speak with you this morning. With Pfizer acquiring Metsera for up to $7.3 billion, how meaningful could future royalty income from these obesity drug programs be for IP Group?

Greg Smith: This is quite an interesting development. So this is something that we spoke a little bit about at our half-year results. As a part of our business, we have some patents that we license and manage, and this is one of those examples. I think the announcement that Pfizer was acquiring Metsera has shone an additional light on this area of our business — something we feel has been a little bit overlooked by the market.

So we felt it deserved a bit of an update in the spirit of our commitment to transparency. Pfizer is paying almost $5 billion upfront to acquire Metsera and its anti-obesity drug programs. It’s interesting for IP Group because we are the licensor of the fundamental underlying technology behind their lead compounds and a number of others. If those compounds successfully progress through phase two, phase three, and reach the market, then we could benefit from some quite substantial royalties on drug sales. So it's a significant potential source of future value for IP Group and its shareholders.

Proactive: Metsera’s lead drug is heading into phase three next year. When might IP Group realistically start seeing milestone payments or royalties from this pipeline?

Greg Smith: Interestingly, Metsera recently said they’re accelerating the timetable due to strong progress. They’re targeting getting the phase three trial up and running by the end of this year, which is good news. Analyst forecasts suggest first sales might come in 2029 or 2030.

The majority of our value would come once sales begin, so 2029, 2030 and beyond. It’s worth pointing out these compounds were produced by Professor Stephen Bloom at Imperial College London. Back in 1996, his team discovered that GLP-1 suppresses appetite, laying the groundwork for these therapies. So it’s a high-quality source, which is why we're particularly excited about this opportunity.

This is a very big market, and the drugs have the potential to impact hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of patients. It’s another great example of how IP Group backs developments that target big markets with human impact and significant financial return potential.

Proactive: Does this potential royalty stream change how you think about IP Group's growth model — from being an early-stage investor to holding longer-term revenue interests in late-stage assets?

Greg Smith: It’s an interesting question. It could be of such magnitude over time that we need to think about how we articulate this in our strategy and monetisation plans for shareholders. Ongoing long-term revenue streams fit well with the long-term business model we have at IP Group. It’s one of the benefits of having a permanent capital vehicle that can invest over the long term and grow businesses to material value.

Proactive: It's been a busy period for IP Group. You announced three successful exits recently, including the sale of Monolith to Nasdaq-listed CoreWeave. Are we seeing a broader crystallisation phase for the IP Group portfolio?

Greg Smith: You probably remember that 2022 and 2023 were tough years for the venture market. Last year, we bucked the trend with good progress on realisations — around £160 million in 2024. That included major exits like Featurespace to Visa and Garrison Technology to Everfox.

There’s increasing confidence within IP Group that our portfolio is maturing and attractive for exits, especially in areas suitable for M&A. The CoreWeave exit is another example of the portfolio’s quality. It probably wasn’t a company many shareholders knew about, yet we delivered a strong financial result.

At our full-year results, we said we’re confident in achieving over £250 million in realisations from our private portfolio between 2025 and 2027. This is another positive sign in that direction.

Proactive: Greg, you're also investing £4 million into OXCCU as part of a broader fundraising. Encouraging to see your portfolio getting lots of third-party interest?

Greg Smith: Yes. Exits are the end of the line — that’s where we recycle capital into buybacks or reinvest in the next generation of value-creating companies.

OXCCU is one of those. They’ve just closed a $28 million funding round. What’s interesting is the breadth and depth of investors — including Safran Corporate Ventures and International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent of British Airways. Also involved were other clean tech investors like Clean Energy Ventures from the US.

It’s great to be in a financial position to support this business into its next growth stage. They're based in Oxford and have their proving plant on Oxford Airfield. Many airlines are now committing to including SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) in their fuel mix by 2030, 2040 and 2050.

IAG said they want 10% of their fuel mix to be SAF by 2030 — and that’s not far off. So this investment helps them meet that commitment. The regulatory and industry drivers suggest a bright future for OXCCU. It’s a great example of a British company tackling global problems and attracting strong specialist investment.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI1XzEwXC8yMDI1LTEwLTE3LTE2LTEyLTEwLTE5MDE1ZThjMjcyMjA1YWQxMDhkYWUzYzIyZjMwNWY4LmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6MTIwMCwiaGVpZ2h0Ijo2MzAsImZpdCI6ImNvdmVyIn19fQ==,N,,2025-10-18 10:56:48.360530

Finally, we provide eco-travel tips and explain key flight information to guide travelers in sustainable exploration.

Air France, Delta, Lufthansa, and United Airlines Lead Sustainable Travel Efforts

In the past, the aviation sector has played a major role in contributing to worldwide emissions, but there are changes to consider in the hopes of eco-friendly customers. The primary carriers in the field recognize the need to introduce effective emissions mitigation plans and put them into action. Market players such as Air France, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa, and United Airlines developed new and creative methods to minimize the levels of embedded emissions. For these carriers, the levels of embedded emissions are likely to decrease annually, as they use biofuels and other Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) frameworks and engage in various approaches to carbon offsetting.

Air France’s Commitment to Sustainable Aviation

Air France, the leading airline to put SAF into action, shows the impact positive measures can take on the climate, shifting to a more innovative and greener approach. Air France predicted to use more than 43,953 of SAF in 2024 and decrease 150,000 CO2 emissions. This shows Air France’s will and determination in the airline’s promise to climate mitigation greenery. It shows advancement to the projected 2030 10% of the Air France global fuel mix use SAF as a carbon mitigation strategy blend while increasing the positive aviation climate impact. Air France loophole travelers use greener methods and minimized the impact of their carbon footprint.

Delta Airlines Sustainablity Initiatives

In the upcoming years, this airline plans to release 200 new, more sustainable planes that are expected to enter the aviation industry by 2030. This signifies that passengers flying with this airline, can enjoy their trip and green travel without sacrificing their safety and comfort.#### United Airlines’ Green Aircraft Program

United Airlines also is also becoming environmentally sustainable. In 2024, United blended sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with regular jet fuel. United plans to have net-zero emissions by 2050. Other investments to improve sustainability with green technologies include aircraft. Passengers traveling with United can relax knowing that the airline is cutting down the carbon footprint.

France Urges World Bank to Stick to Climate Finance Goals

The airline industry is becoming more sustainable and the hospitality industry is also just starting to become more sustainable. Much more on the global scale still needs to be done to prioritize investments focused on climate change. France is one of the global climate change leaders.

France’s Advocacy for Climate Finance

Despite some countries–including the United States–pressuring the World Bank to no longer provide climate finance, France has actively been encouraging the World Bank to continue. France endorses the World Bank’s new target of 45% of climate finance as an improvement from the previous 35%. Since the consequences of climate change are worse than they have ever been, France believes that climate finance is necessary so developing countries can make a more sustainable transition.

The Role of the Hospitality Industry in Sustainability

As the airline industry works towards a more sustainable future, so is a part of the hospitality industry. Major hotel chains such as Marriott, Accor Hotels, and Hilton are trying to lessen their impact on the environment by implementing energy-efficiency, conserving water, and waste reduction. For travelers in search of more environmentally friendly accommodations, these hotel chains are leading the way with their green building certifications and commitment to build more sustainable hotels.

Marriott Hotels: In 2024, Marriott started a new sustainability program aimed at cutting down on water and energy used at all of its hotels and resorts worldwide. Marriott is also going green-moving waste and responsibly sourcing materials. People looking for a greener stay will feel good about eco-friendly options with a stay at Marriott.

Accor Hotels: Since releasing a new sustainability plan, aimed at an overall 30% reduction in carbon emissions expected to be completed by 2030. Several eco-friendly initiatives have begun with solar power, new energy efficient appliances, and promoting sustainable tourist packages for visitors.

Hilton Hotels: Hilton is also doing the same. It is also doing the same by decreasing their negative impact on… waste reduction—in this case, a water saving plan. Eco-conscious stays would be informed through eco-positive stays.

Travel Tips for Eco-Friendly Tourism

The encouraging impact on sustainability within the global tourism sector must be mirrored by travelers. The following travel tips help close the gap to minimize one’s negative (carbon) footprint.

Pick Sustainable Airlines and Flights

Responsible digitalisation is also achieved through small actions. And, in this regard, we are taking a new step: business travel by plane from Telefónica will be more sustainable.

Together with Amadeus, BBVA and Repsol, we are one of the founding companies of “Círculo SAF”. Together with these three corporations, we are contributing to the reduction of part of the emissions generated by certain corporate trips and cargo flights operated by Iberia, promoting the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) on these flights. This means a reduction in global emissions in the aviation sector, contributing directly to the fight against climate change, with an estimated reduction of between 10% and 30% in Scope 3 emissions from companies in their activity with Iberia.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is an alternative fuel for flights. It is produced from agricultural or forestry waste, or from renewable hydrogen, CO2 captured from the air or industrial processes. Compared to traditional kerosene, SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 80% in terms of life cycle, according to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).

The great advantage of SAF is that it can be used without making any changes to aircraft engines or airport infrastructure. It is therefore currently the viable alternative for reducing part of the emissions in the aviation sector.

Why are we joining this initiative?

Because our commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2040 also includes our value chain. And that means an ESG culture with more sustainable habits on all fronts.

Because, although corporate travel only accounts for 2% of our global indirect CO2 emissions (scope 3), every tonne counts!

Because it is a pioneering proposal that translates into real changes in the decarbonisation of the economy and accelerates the energy transition.

Building on the Clean Industrial Deal introduced earlier this year, the new international strategy outlines how the EU plans to create a fair, sustainable, and secure energy future both within its borders and around the world.

Clean industry

The new EU global climate and energy vision places clean technology and resilient energy systems at the core of Europe’s international engagement. As the world undergoes a rapid clean industrial revolution, the EU intends to become the leading supplier of clean technologies and adaptation solutions to countries across the globe.

With nearly half of its electricity already generated from renewable sources in 2024, the EU has made significant progress in reducing its dependence on fossil fuel imports. Clean energy investments in the bloc have more than doubled since 2015, reinforcing its position as a key player in the global green economy.

The EU aims to ramp up its clean technology manufacturing capacity to capture 15% of the global market, aligning this goal with the broader objectives of the Clean Industrial Deal, which supports decarbonisation and competitiveness of European industry.

Global partnership

The EU’s strategy emphasises the need for robust and mutually beneficial international cooperation. Through a mix of bilateral and multilateral partnerships, the EU plans to expand clean value chains and promote global standards for sustainability and fair trade.

To support this, the EU will utilise initiatives such as the Global Gateway Investment Hub and the Global Europe envelope to connect European businesses with global investment opportunities. A new Clean Transition Business Council will also be established to facilitate the international expansion of EU clean tech firms and promote climate-resilient business models abroad.

Fair rules and innovation

The EU’s approach is a strong commitment to a rules-based international order and the full implementation of the Paris Agreement. Carbon pricing is highlighted as a key tool to reduce emissions, foster innovation, and ensure a just transition. The EU plans to promote carbon pricing globally through a dedicated task force and support partner countries in establishing their own systems.

The EU will continue efforts to reform global financial institutions to support climate objectives and resilient economic growth better. Security is also a growing focus, with climate change now firmly seen as a strategic issue. The EU will strengthen its response to climate-related security risks by working with international bodies such as the UN and NATO and countering disinformation about climate policies.

Kaja Kallas, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the European Commission said; “Energy supplies are being weaponised while our climate rapidly changes. Energy is a resource and a strategic capability. Today we set out where the EU will focus our climate and energy diplomacy, from promoting European clean tech businesses, to upping our investment in projects across the globe that support a sustainable transition.”

Creating change

The EU’s new strategy hopes to inject fresh political momentum into the global clean transition. By encouraging action through international forums and the Global Stocktake process, the EU aims to keep the world on track to meet shared climate goals.

This global vision builds on the Clean Industrial Deal presented earlier in 2025, which targeted the decarbonisation of energy-intensive industries and introduced new tools such as tax incentives and a revised State Aid Framework to support clean tech innovation.

With greenhouse gas emissions already cut by 37% since 1990, the EU remains on course to reach climate neutrality by 2050. Although it contributes just 6% of global emissions, the EU continues to be the largest provider of climate finance globally, underlining its ambition to lead by example.",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/iStock-489193525-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 03:56:37.393381

Supporting continued growth of U.S. biomass-based diesel is crucial right now to support American farmers and the agricultural economy.""","LINCOLN, Neb. (DTN) -- U.S. soybean farmers could lose between $3.2 billion and $7.5 billion if the Trump administration does not completely reallocate biofuels gallons to small-refinery exemptions to the Renewable Fuel Standard, a biofuels group told Lee Zeldin, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in an Oct. 16, 2025, letter.

Clean Fuels Alliance America cited an analysis by World Agricultural Economic and Environmental Services, that outlines the losses to soybean farmers based on how much volume from SREs is reallocated.

The EPA issued a supplemental proposal to the RFS volumes, asking for public input on a range of reallocation from zero to 100%.

According to the company's study, if the agency adopts a 50% reallocation in 2026 to 2027 490 million gallons of biomass-based diesel production would be lost, leading to $1.4 billion in lost soybean farm revenue and a $1.8 billion drop in the value of soybean products to soybean crushers.

Clean Fuels said in the letter to Zeldin that reallocating zero gallons of biofuels would be ""considerable worse.""

The analysis found it would lead to 1 billion gallons of lost biomass-based diesel production, $2.6 billion in lost soybean revenue to farms and a $4.9 billion drop in the value of soybean products to crushers.

""Biomass-based diesel is essential to America's farm security, now more than ever,"" Clean Fuels said in the letter.

""Domestic biodiesel, renewable diesel and SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) production supports 10% of the value of every bushel of soybeans grown in the United States. With increased farm productivity, U.S. soybean growers are right now harvesting a projected 4.3 billion bushels of soybeans for the season worth $43 billion. And with more than $6 billion of investment, U.S. soybean processors are expected to crush a record 2.5 billion of those bushels next year.""

Clean Fuels said that in facing retaliatory trade measures from China and a growing global competition from Argentina and Brazil, ""America's farmers cannot afford to lose the value"" that U.S. biomass-based diesel brings.

""We acknowledge that the current government shutdown is impacting both the administration's ability to provide economic relief to America's farmers and EPA's goal of meeting the statutory deadlines for the RFS rule,"" the group told Zeldin.

""Nevertheless, America's farmers are facing extreme economic challenge

and making planting decisions for next season. Biomass-based diesel producers and soybean processors are already negotiating feedstock contracts, fuel production and offtake agreements, and investment decisions for 2026. Across the board, our industry needs the rulemaking to be published before the end of the year to provide necessary policy stability and market confidence.""

Kurt Kovarik, Clean Fuels' vice president of federal affairs, said in a statement, ""Clean Fuels urges EPA to quickly finalize the robust, timely RFS volumes it proposed in June and ensure they are not eroded by small-refinery exemptions. U.S. biodiesel and renewable diesel production supports 10% of the value of every bushel of soybeans grown here. Supporting continued growth of U.S. biomass-based diesel is crucial right now to support American farmers and the agricultural economy.""

Abra Group orders new Airbus narrow-body and wide-body jets

Abra Group has confirmed an order for new Airbus aircraft to increase connectivity across the Americas and Europe. The move supports its plan to meet rising travel demand and strengthen its position in key markets.

To enhance long-haul capability, Abra has agreed to acquire up to seven Airbus A330neo aircraft. These aircraft will be deployed across the Group’s airlines depending on market and financial needs.

The A330neo offers 14% lower fuel use per seat than the older A330ceo. It is also around 60% quieter, cutting airport noise and improving the passenger experience.

Abra has also confirmed 50 additional Airbus A320neo aircraft, bringing its total order for this model to 138 units. Deliveries will continue through 2032. The Group already holds firm orders for 88 A320neo and 96 Boeing 737 Max aircraft.

The first A320neo with the new Airspace cabin will enter service with Avianca in late 2025. The aircraft will include XL overhead bins providing 60% more storage, adjustable LED lighting, and three rows of Recaro-designed Premium seats in a two-by-two layout. These features will combine comfort with fuel efficiency and lower emissions.

In total, Abra’s fleet plan now includes 234 new narrow-body and wide-body aircraft. This mix of Airbus and Boeing models will allow the Group to serve more destinations and operate with greater sustainability.

The order marks another step in Abra’s strategy to renew its fleet and improve the passenger journey. It underlines the company’s commitment to efficient, modern aircraft and a more connected network across its markets.

Through these new aircraft, Abra aims to offer a smoother, quieter, and greener flying experience for travellers worldwide.

The plans include: Conversion of existing aviation fuel storage tanks to handle SAF, before it is blended with conventional aviation fuel.
Within the existing tanks, the installation of a state-of-the-art SAF blending infrastructure, which will ensure that SAF is blended with conventional aviation fuel to the correct technical standards.
We’ve committed to working with our airline customers to meet the U.K.’s SAF mandate as part of our aim to be a net zero airport by 2050.”","Exolum, Europe’s leading energy logistics company, on Oct. 15 announced its decision to invest £4.5 million in creating the U.K.’s first independent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blending facility at Redcliffe Bay in south-west England, as part of new plans for a U.K.-wide network of SAF blending hubs.

The announcement comes as the U.K.’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill, which creates new subsidies for SAF production, progresses to its next stage in Parliament. SAF is a ‘drop-in’ biofuel that is blended with conventional aviation fuel and used in airplanes without modification, to reduce the carbon emissions of flying.

By blending customers’ SAF into Exolum’s national aviation fuel pipeline network, the investment will boost green aviation fuel supplies to airports across southern England and Wales, including those at Heathrow, Gatwick, Bristol, Exeter and Cardiff.

The company is also announcing that the facility will be the first of a new U.K.-wide network of SAF blending hubs it plans as part of its 2,000km pipeline network, creating a SAF Superhighway that will provide SAF producers and importers with market access to the jet fuel for 40% of flights leaving the U.K.’s airports.

Expected to be operational from 2026, the initial investment at Redcliffe Bay will support the greening of the equivalent of up to 64,741 flights from London to New York a year, supporting the U.K.’s position as a global leader in green aviation.

The plans will enable long-term green investment in SAF production plants across the U.K. and, in the case of Redcliffe Bay, south-west of England and southern Wales, by providing a crucial, independent route to market for when they become operational, which is expected later this decade.

Unblended SAF will initially be delivered by ships to Bristol’s Royal Portbury Dock, before being transported to Exolum’s Redcliffe Bay site by pipeline. It will then be stored and blended on-site with conventional aviation fuel, to create the ready-to-use ‘drop-in’ fuel that is then distributed by Exolum’s national pipeline system.

The project includes several infrastructure upgrades to Exolum’s existing aviation fuel pipeline storage and pumping station at Redcliffe Bay, on the banks of the Severn Estuary near Bristol. The plans include:

Conversion of existing aviation fuel storage tanks to handle SAF, before it is blended with conventional aviation fuel.

Within the existing tanks, the installation of a state-of-the-art SAF blending infrastructure, which will ensure that SAF is blended with conventional aviation fuel to the correct technical standards.

Modifying existing systems by installing new pumps, filtration systems and segregation valves to circulate SAF between storage tanks and to pump into the pipeline network.

Exolum North West Europe Lead, Stephen Land, says, ""Exolum’s investment at Redcliffe Bay is turning the U.K.’s ambitions for greener flights into reality, whilst helping secure the country’s world-leading position at the forefront of global sustainable aviation.

“The U.K.’s twin commitments to airport expansion and to increasing SAF supplies have been crucial in ensuring that, and we’re looking forward to not only supporting greener aviation but also the growth of the U.K.’s sustainable fuels industry.”

U.K. Department for Transport Aviation Minister, Keir Mather MP, says, “I’m excited to see the rollout of Exolum’s SAF network, which will help support regional jobs across the country and is another major vote of confidence in our SAF polices including the SAF Bill, which is back in Parliament for its third reading.”

“We're also investing £63 million to support the production of homegrown SAF which, alongside our mandate to increase the supply of SAF in aviation fuel to U.K. flights, will drive demand for greener fuels and support jobs in the U.K.""

Sadik Al Hassan MP, sustainable aviation champion and MP for North Somerset, says, “Exolum’s £4.5 million investment in their Redcliffe Bay facility marks a significant boost for North Somerset, helping support new technical jobs across the sustainable aviation supply chain in southwest England, whilst advancing the U.K.’s leadership in green aviation.

“Their vision for a sustainable aviation fuel ‘superhighway’ links delivery hubs to where the green fuel is needed most across the country, making the region more attractive for green investment in sustainable fuel production. It’s a clear signal that the green transition isn’t just possible but here.”

Dave Lees, CEO of Bristol Airport, says, “It’s fantastic to see this investment in our region, with blending facilities being a vital part of the future SAF supply chain that we need to decarbonize aviation. We’ve committed to working with our airline customers to meet the U.K.’s SAF mandate as part of our aim to be a net zero airport by 2050.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Exolum_Oct252_a9c43a1f69.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 17:00:49.996833

It is not compulsory for the new recipients to fully utilise the allotted permits by the end of 2025, according to the JLC report, but it is also unclear if the companies need to re-apply for quotas next year.

Zhejiang Jiaao exported its first cargo in early May.

What is the Green Aviation Fuel Levy?

Simply put, this is a small fee added to departing flights to fund the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). It’s an eco-friendly alternative to regular jet fuel. The catch, however, is that sustainable aviation fuel is three to four times more expensive to produce than normal jet fuel. That’s where the levy comes in.

How much more will passengers pay

Although the levy will technically be paid by aircraft operators, most are expected to pass on the cost to passengers as part of the overall ticket price, similar to existing airport or fuel surcharges.

Early estimates suggest that the additional cost will be modest: around S$3 for short-haul flights, S$6 for medium-haul, and S$16 for long-haul journeys. In other words, roughly the price of a cup of coffee at the airport.

While it’s a small increase, the collective impact will help support the production and use of cleaner fuels, paving the way for a more sustainable future in aviation.

Who will be exempt

The levy will apply to departing flights from Singapore, but there are a few key exemptions. Passengers who are transiting or transferring through Changi. Meaning if they’re only stopping in Singapore to catch another flight, they won’t have to pay the charge.

This exemption ensures that Singapore remains an attractive and competitive hub for international travellers. Flights used for training, humanitarian, or charitable purposes will also be excluded from the levy.

A modest start towards sustainability

To kick things off, Singapore is targeting 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar Airport to be sustainable by 2026. It may sound small, but it’s a deliberate and practical starting point.

This measured approach allows Singapore to make tangible progress towards greener aviation without causing a sharp rise in airfares or operational costs for airlines. The Government will continue to monitor the rollout to ensure that both airlines and passengers benefit from cost stability as the programme scales up in future.

What travellers can expect

For most travellers, this change will mean a small increase in ticket prices, but it’s a necessary step towards a cleaner, more responsible way to fly. The funds collected through the levy will support Singapore’s broader sustainability goals, helping reduce aviation’s carbon footprint and keeping the city-state ahead in green innovation.

In short, the next time you book a flight out of Changi and notice a slight bump in your fare, you’ll know that those few extra dollars are helping make global travel just a little bit greener.

The facility, which is powered by FlyORO’s proprietary patented technology, is not only an Australia first, but also the first SAF blending terminal co-located at an airport globally. Its modular design can scale with demand and be replicated as the SAF industry takes hold in Australia and the Asia Pacific.

In addition, Wagner Sustainable Fuels has become Australia’s first RSB (Roundtable of Sustainable Biomaterials) certified SAF company. This gives customers a world-leading accounting process and guarantees chain-of-custody and SAF authenticity.

“This is a defining moment for sustainable aviation in Australia and underscores Wagner Sustainable Fuels’ commitment to provide solutions today for the challenges of tomorrow,” said Matt Doyle, CEO Wagner Sustainable Fuels. “The launch of our Toowoomba Terminal is the start of our plans to deliver decarbonization benefits and meet the aviation sector’s growing demand through flexible, efficient and scalable SAF blending.”

“With the support from Boeing, we’re focused on bringing large scale SAF and renewable diesel production to Australia and integrating it into the global supply chain through the Brisbane Recycling and SAF Facility, which is currently under planning and development,” said Doyle.

Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF is produced from renewable or non-fossil fuel sources – like municipal solid waste, agricultural waste, animal fats and vegetable oils – and significantly reduces carbon emissions over the fuel’s lifecycle, making it a more sustainable alternative for powering aircraft.

SAF blending is the controlled mixing of “neat” SAF with conventional fossil jet fuel that, once tested and certified, is a pure drop-in aviation fuel acceptable within current airport and aircraft infrastructure.

“Current global regulations permit commercial aircraft to use up to a 50/50 blend of SAF and fossil jet fuel. This will continue to rise as additional production pathways are certified,” said Dr. Kimberly Camrass, Boeing head of Asia Pacific Sustainability.

“Wagner’s commercial blending terminal is a powerful step forward in aviation decarbonisation, boosting regional employment and opening new export markets. It will also provide important learnings to support the development of robust and scalable SAF supply chains within Australia.”

According to the Boeing CSIRO SAF Roadmapopens in a new tab, jet fuel demand in Australia is projected to grow by 75% by 2050. Wagner Sustainable Fuels partnered with FlyORO to deploy advanced and scalable SAF blending technologies in Australia for commercial, general aviation and defence customers.

“FlyORO’s modular SAF blending system, AlphaLite, doesn’t just help reduce emissions – it creates a scalable platform for collaboration, co-investment, and transparency across the fuel value chain,” said Jonathan Yeo, FlyORO’s Chief Executive Officer. “This integrated model complements FlyORO’s broader deployment strategy, including standalone facilities such as the one operating in Singapore.

“This is how we unlock speed and scale. We’re excited to partner with the leadership of Wagner Sustainable Fuels and Boeing to pioneer a more sustainable flying ecosystem in Australia.”

RICHARDTON, N.D. (North Dakota Monitor) – A sustainable aviation fuel developer plans to shift investment from South Dakota to North Dakota, in part because of delays in the development of the multi-state Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline.

Then-Lieutenant Governor Larry Rhoden attended a groundbreaking on the project in South Dakota in September 2022 (pictured).

Colorado-based Gevo had obtained a $1.46 billion loan through the U.S. Department of Energy to build a jet fuel plant at Lake Preston, South Dakota. Company officials told the North Dakota Monitor on Thursday that it instead will push ahead with making jet fuel at the Richardton, North Dakota, ethanol plant it bought last year. Gevo is working with the Department of Energy to transfer the loan to expand the North Dakota site.

Red Trail Energy at Richardton in 2022 became the first ethanol plant in the country to capture and store carbon dioxide, taking advantage of its location in an area with the right geology for permanent underground storage.

Gevo plans to expand the North Dakota ethanol plant, which turns corn into fuel. It would convert the ethanol into higher-value aviation fuel in a process it calls alcohol to jet. Carbon capture is a key part of making sustainable aviation fuel.

“We don’t have to share pipelines. We don’t have to wait. We’re already doing it,” CEO Pat Gruber said of carbon capture at the North Dakota site.

Gevo’s South Dakota site relied on the planned Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline to take carbon dioxide to an underground storage site in North Dakota. But the future of that project in South Dakota is in doubt because of landowner resistance and state permitting hurdles.

Iowa-based Summit is seeking to change its pipeline permit in that state. Summit wants to remove North Dakota as the designated end point for the pipeline.

A spokesperson for Summit said Friday the change “keeps open the option to transport CO2 west through Nebraska or north through South Dakota,” reported the Iowa Capital Dispatch.

Gruber said the jet fuel production in North Dakota would be 30 million gallons of jet fuel a year, half of what was planned for South Dakota. But he said the 500 acres at Richardton could allow for expansion.

He said the jet fuel plant would cost about $500 million. Gruber noted that is substantially less than $2.6 billion it planned to spend on the South Dakota site.

Gevo is hosting a meeting Monday to answer questions for farmers and others in the Richardton area. The meeting will be from 6 to 7:30 Mountain Time at WIX Barn near Richardton.

Gruber said building in North Dakota also opens the door to Gevo selling its carbon to the oil industry. North Dakota oil producers could buy the carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery — pumping gas into the well to help the well produce more oil.

“This is a great opportunity for us, and we sit right next to Bakken,” Gruber said, referring to the Bakken Formation. North Dakota is the nation’s No. 3 oil producing state, with most of it coming from the Bakken.

Oil industry and state leaders have touted enhanced oil recovery as a way for North Dakota to sustain oil production for decades to come and continue to provide the state with tax revenue.

Gruber said Gevo has started discussion with oil companies, but he said the infrastructure to make enhanced oil recovery possible is still years away.

Ethanol plants are seen as a prime source for carbon dioxide because the gas is captured from the fermentation process of turning corn into ethanol instead of from the burning of fuel.

“It’s pure, concentrated CO2,” Gruber said.

Another benefit of carbon capture for Gevo is the ability to sell carbon credits to other industries with high carbon emissions. Gevo in September announced it is partnering with Biorecro North America on carbon credit sales generated at the North Dakota facility.

Gruber said he was grateful the Department of Energy for working with Gevo on transferring the federal loan, though there are steps remaining to complete the process. Gevo filed a document with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday of its intent to use the loan money in North Dakota.

As for the future of the eastern South Dakota site, Gevo officials said it remains a great industrial location and will be developed.

“The are other things we can do at that site,” said Paul Bloom, Gevo’s chief business officer. “It’s a matter of when.”

But the Gevo officials said the demand for sustainable aviation fuel meant the company could not wait for the Summit pipeline. Summit had hoped to be operating in 2024 but has yet to start construction as it tries to secure all the permits it needs.

“We can’t sit around for that,” Gruber said. “We’ve got a mission here.”",https://www.gowatertown.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Gevo-640x400.jpg?icb=1760752571,N,,2025-10-17 21:56:18.199950

“Taiwan is committed to reducing its carbon emissions and biofuels are a powerful tool to improve environmental and human health, so the Council and its members are eager and willing to be a resource to help the development of ethanol adoption here,” LeGrand said.

After arrival, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) provided a briefing for attending USDA cooperators about the social, economic and political landscapes in the country and how they affect the agricultural market.

The next day, the Council’s delegation visited the Taiwan Science and Technology Office for Net-Zero Emission (T-STONE) to discuss developments in global biofuel policy and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) development, and they received an update on gasoline blending policies in other Asian countries.

The group then attended a meeting of the Ethanol Gasoline Promotion Committee, where members of the Council’s team presented about the carbon reduction potential of an E10 gasoline blending rate and the steps needed to prepare infrastructure to deliver it to consumers.

Gevo Investment Narrative Recap

To be a Gevo shareholder today, you need confidence in the company's ability to commercialize sustainable aviation fuel and secure recurring high-margin revenue, with the extended US$1.46 billion Department of Energy (DOE) loan guarantee reducing short-term financing risk and preserving the most important project catalyst: timely project funding. However, Gevo's business remains heavily exposed to government tax credits and policy changes, which could still materially impact future profitability, so the impact of this extension does not remove those risks.

Gevo’s recent partnership with Frontier Infrastructure Holdings to launch North America's first integrated carbon management platform is especially relevant in light of the DOE extension, as it highlights the company’s focus on creating new revenue opportunities while capitalizing on federal support, enhancing potential project economics if scaled successfully.

,,2025-10-17 16:36:09+00:00,Pro Farmer,Bunge shares soar after Trump puts spotlight on cooking oil - Pro Farmer,"Bill Watts, www.profarmer.com, bill-watts",,,,,https://www.profarmer.com/news/agriculture-news/bunge-shares-soar-after-trump-puts-spotlight-cooking-oil,"Acronym-loving Wall Street traders this week sent shares of grain trading and processing giant Bunge Corp. soaring after President Donald Trump on Tuesday said his administration was considering “terminating business with China” when it comes to imports of cooking oil.
That threw a spotlight on used cooking oil, or UCO, which is used as a feedstock for biofuels and as a competitor to soybean oil.
“With fewer UCO imports, we expect stronger demand for domestically produced soybean oil as a feedstock for biodiesel.
Still, a ban would be seen as a net positive for companies such as ADM and Bunge because UCO imports have historically pressured domestic soybean crush margins, the analyst wrote.
Soybeans added another 7 cents as of 10:30 Friday morning after Trump appeared to take down the temperature in the U.S.-China trade battle, telling Fox News that proposed 100% tariffs on China probably weren’t sustainable.","Acronym-loving Wall Street traders this week sent shares of grain trading and processing giant Bunge Corp. soaring after President Donald Trump on Tuesday said his administration was considering “terminating business with China” when it comes to imports of cooking oil. That threw a spotlight on used cooking oil, or UCO, which is used as a feedstock for biofuels and as a competitor to soybean oil.

Trump’s ire was in response to China’s continued lack of U.S. soybean purchases and appeared to offer some support to soybean oil prices, with the December futures contract up 1.8% this week through Thursday’s close, while November soybeans were up 4 3/4 cents, or 0.4%, over the first four days of the week.

But it was Bunge that was off like a rocket, posting a week-to-date gain of 18% through Thursday’s close, with the move coming after Trump’s Tuesday announcement. Archer Daniels Midland also didn’t do too shabby, posting a 3.4% gain over the same stretch. It comes during a week that saw equities wobble in response to credit jitters surrounding regional banks, though major indexes remain on track for weekly gains as earnings season moves into full swing.

So what gives? China’s UCO exports to the U.S. have tanked after hitting a record high in 2024 at 1.27 million metric tons, according to USDA, accounting for around 43% of China’s total UCO exports. Since then, Beijing has eliminated an export tax rebate for UCO and the U.S. has dropped tax credits for foreign-sourced feedstocks and imposed tariffs.

“With fewer UCO imports, we expect stronger demand for domestically produced soybean oil as a feedstock for biodiesel. That said, the overall impact may be limited, since UCO imports from China have already declined over the past year due to less tax incentives and higher tariffs,” said Arun Sundaram, analyst at CFRA, in a note this week. China has been redirecting UCO exports to other regions like Europe, where tariffs are lower and demand for biofuels, particularly sustainable aviation fuel, is rising, he wrote.

Still, a ban would be seen as a net positive for companies such as ADM and Bunge because UCO imports have historically pressured domestic soybean crush margins, the analyst wrote.

It wasn’t just UCO that lifted Bunge shares. The rally also came after a revised full-year outlook from the company in the wake of its recently closed merger with Viterra. Bunge now sees full-year adjusted earnings per share between $7.30 and $7.60, below its previous guidance of about $7.75 but still better than the $6.99 Wall Street consensus, Sundaram noted.

Soybeans added another 7 cents as of 10:30 Friday morning after Trump appeared to take down the temperature in the U.S.-China trade battle, telling Fox News that proposed 100% tariffs on China probably weren’t sustainable. “I think we’re going to be fine with China, but we have to have a fair deal,” he said.",https://assets.farmjournal.com/dims4/default/e604715/2147483647/strip/true/crop/640x360+0+60/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffj-corp-pub.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2F2017-10%2Fgrain%20bins%202.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 14:56:51.985220

The announcement, made by Airbus and IndiGo on October 17, 2025, brings IndiGo’s total A350 commitments to 60 aircraft as the airline prepares to expand into long-haul international markets.

Airbus said the order marks a significant step in IndiGo’s international growth strategy, providing additional range and efficiency for its planned expansion into new global destinations. Deliveries are expected to begin later this decade, though neither company disclosed a detailed schedule.

“Today is a special day for IndiGo as we solidify our commitment to expanding our international footprint and offering unparalleled connectivity to our customers,” said Pieter Elbers, CEO of IndiGo. “The conversion of this MoU into a firm order for 30 additional A350-900s is a testament to our confidence in the future of Indian aviation and our strategic partnership with Airbus.”

Elbers said the A350 will play a central role in IndiGo’s future fleet as the airline prepares to launch long-haul flights for the first time. The aircraft will be powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-84 engines under a long-term TotalCare support agreement that includes continuous engine health monitoring and maintenance services throughout the life of the fleet.

Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, Executive Vice President of Sales for Airbus Commercial Aircraft, said the order highlights IndiGo’s ambitions to expand beyond its traditional short-haul markets. “The A350’s fuel efficiency, range, and passenger comfort align perfectly with IndiGo’s growth plans and long-haul network strategy,” he said.

The new commitment converts 30 purchase rights into firm orders, building on IndiGo’s initial order for 30 A350-900s placed in April 2024. The first 30 were IndiGo’s initial widebody purchase and marked the airline’s entry into the long-haul segment. With the latest agreement, IndiGo now holds firm orders for 60 A350-900s, all powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines.

The A350-900 is Airbus’s most advanced twin-aisle aircraft, seating between 300 and 410 passengers depending on configuration. It is designed for long-range operations and uses lightweight composite materials that reduce fuel consumption and emissions by about 25 percent compared with older widebody models. The aircraft can operate on up to 50 percent sustainable aviation fuel, with Airbus targeting full compatibility by 2030.

IndiGo, based in Gurugram, is India’s largest airline by fleet size and passenger numbers. It operates more than 400 aircraft and runs about 2,200 daily flights, connecting 90 domestic and 40 international destinations.

Founded in 2006, IndiGo has built its business around a low-cost, high-frequency model using primarily Airbus A320 and A321neo aircraft, along with ATR 72 turboprops for shorter routes. Its move into long-haul service marks a strategic expansion into new markets connecting India with Europe, East Asia, and North America.

India’s fast-growing aviation sector has fueled record aircraft orders in recent years, driven by economic expansion and rising demand for international travel. Airbus maintains a long-standing presence in the country, with its A320 family serving as the backbone of India’s domestic fleets.

At the end of September 2025, Airbus had received more than 1,400 orders for the A350 from 63 customers worldwide. The addition of IndiGo’s latest firm order further strengthens Airbus’s position in one of the world’s most dynamic air travel markets.

U.S. and Singapore Urge UN to Postpone Vote on Carbon Pricing for Shipping

The United States, Singapore, Liberia, and Saudi Arabia have collectively called on the U.N. International Maritime Organization (IMO) to suspend enforcement of a proposed carbon price on shipping after a period of talks in London concluded without agreement. Washington and Riyadh continue to strongly oppose a carbon price in the maritime sector, while the European Union continues to support the measure as part of its global decarbonization strategies.

U.S. President Donald Trump called on IMO member states on Thursday to vote no, stating on his Truth Social platform that Washington would “not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping and will not adhere to it in any way, shape or form.” “This week’s IMO meeting in London … appears to be on the verge of collapse,” Jefferies analyst Omar Nokta wrote in an investor note on Friday.

Daylight Secures $75 Million to Expand Residential Solar Power Network

Daylight Energy, a start up based in New York, has secured $75 million funding to develop its decentralized power network that allows homeowners to generate and share energy. Daylight was founded in 2022 and has since created an alternative to the traditional way by providing homeowners with solar panels and a battery system through a subscription model. The system allows homeowners to save money on their utility costs, have backup power during outages, while allowing them to provide excess energy back into the grid.

Daylight pools the energy capacity from all participating customers, allowing Daylight to sell energy during high demand. Daylight then gives a share of the profits back to the participating customers. The raised $75 million will enable Daylight to accelerate its vision of decentralizing power through homeowners as part of a more resilient and community-based energy grid. To keep up with more industry updates, businesses can rely on ESG solutions.

Construction at Redcliffe Bay will involve upgrading Exolum’s existing aviation fuel infrastructure to handle and blend SAF. Planned improvements include converting current storage tanks, installing new pumps, filtration systems and segregation valves, and adding blending technology to meet technical standards for drop-in aviation fuels.

Unblended SAF will be delivered by ship to Bristol’s Royal Portbury Dock and transported via pipeline to Redcliffe Bay, where it will be stored and blended with conventional jet fuel before entering Exolum’s national distribution system. The facility is expected to begin operations in 2026.

Exolum said the investment will support the decarbonization of up to 64,000 flights from London to New York annually and provide a key route to market for future SAF production plants expected to open later this decade.

Stephen Land, Exolum’s North West Europe Lead, said the Redcliffe Bay project will help make greener flights a reality while strengthening the UK’s role in sustainable aviation.

The announcement comes as the UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill—introducing new subsidies to promote SAF production—continues to progress through Parliament. Aviation Minister Keir Mather MP said the government’s ongoing investment in SAF production and mandates to increase SAF use will “drive demand for greener fuels and support jobs in the UK.”

Regional leaders, including North Somerset MP Sadik Al Hassan and Bristol Airport CEO Dave Lees, also welcomed the development, citing its potential to support local jobs and contribute to the aviation sector’s long-term sustainability goals.","https://img.aviationpros.com/files/base/cygnus/cavc/image/2025/10/68f250187a4caef9c5bd5fcb-rcb_3.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-10-17 13:00:25.172469

SAF can be produced from various feedstocks via different conversion technologies. One technology is Alcohol-to-Jet Fuel (ATJ) which converts alcohols like ethanol or isobutanol into hydrocarbon jet fuel. ATJ involves multiple catalytic steps that are sensitive to moisture. Accurate and reliable moisture measurement is therefore essential to maintain catalyst activity, protect equipment, and ensure product quality.

In the ATJ process, ethylene or other light hydrocarbons are intermediates during the dehydration, oligomerization, and hydroprocessing steps.

Moisture must be tightly controlled in:

Feed gas purification

Dehydration reactors

Oligomerization or hydrocracking units

Final fuel refining or blending stages

Excessive moisture (greater than 1 ppm) in ethylene production processes can lead to catalyst deactivation, corrosion in high-pressure systems, trigger premature reactions, and reduce overall yield and product quality. To maintain moisture levels below the alarm threshold (<1 ppm), molecular sieve dryers are required to remove moisture from the process gas feeds. It’s essential to measure moisture downstream of the process outlet.

The SAF production environment presents the following measurement challenges:

Low Moisture Concentrations: Measurement is often required at ppm or sub-ppm levels.

High Pressure/Temperature: Process streams can operate at pressures 15- 50 barg and temperatures >100°C.

Process Contaminants: Risk of fouling or contamination due to residual catalyst, particulates, or condensables.

Accurate moisture measurement in such demanding environments requires a robust, sensitive, and reliable analyzer system.

Panametrics’ HygroPro II and HygroPro XP aluminum oxide-based moisture transmitters are ideally suited for moisture measurement in SAF production processes due to the following capabilities:

Measurement Range: Detects from ambient to subppm moisture levels.

Sensitivity: Ensures tight process control.

Fast Response Time: Real-time monitoring of moisture changes for proactive control.

Area Classification: Certified for hazardous areas.

Rugged Construction: IP66/IP67 rated for harsh industrial environments.

Versatile Output: 4–20 mA analog + HART protocol for seamless integration with control systems.

Sampling Systems: Packaged solution like pro.IQ or a custom solution to meet application needs for a turnkey solution.

By integrating HygroPro II or HygroPro XP into key points in the SAF process, such as after dehydration reactors or before final blending, operators can prevent costly moisture-related issues and ensure compliance with aviation fuel quality standards (e.g., ASTM D7566)

@IndiGo @Airbus #A350 #LongRangeLeader","New Delhi, India, October 17, 2025 - IndiGo, India’s largest airline, has finalised a commitment for 30 Airbus A350 aircraft, converting a Memorandum of Understanding signed in June into a firm order. This brings the airline's total A350 orders to 60 aircraft. The expanded order marks a strategic shift for IndiGo as it prepares to enter the long-haul international market, leveraging the A350’s long range and efficiency to support its global ambitions.

“Today is a special day for IndiGo as we solidify our commitment to expanding our international footprint and offering unparalleled connectivity to our customers,” said Pieter Elbers, CEO, IndiGo. “The conversion of this MoU into a firm order for 30 additional A350-900s is a testament to our confidence in the future of Indian aviation and our strategic partnership with Airbus, further reinforced by the strong start of our long-haul operations. In line with India’s vision of becoming a global aviation hub and our aspiration to establish ourselves as a leading global aviation player by 2030, IndiGo is taking decisive steps forward. These aircraft, as they join our fleet in the years to come, will play a pivotal role in enabling IndiGo expand its reach, connect India with more destinations across the globe, and offer our customers new international travel opportunities.”

“The A350’s unparalleled fuel efficiency, range and passenger comfort perfectly align with IndiGo’s ambitious growth plans and international long-haul network ambitions. This milestone reinforces our strong partnership with one of the fastest-growing airlines in the world, and we look forward to supporting their expansion into new long-haul markets,” said Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, EVP Sales of the Commercial Aircraft business at Airbus.

India, the world’s fastest growing aviation market, is witnessing a surge in international travel as the economy grows and household incomes rise. The A350 is perfectly positioned to serve the country’s aspirations for long-range travel.

Bound in a strategic relationship of growth with India for more than half a century, Airbus products and services have catalysed the growth of the country’s civil aviation sector. While the A320 Family aircraft are supporting the democratisation of air travel in India, the A350 has become the reference aircraft to unlock the potential of the international market for the Indian carriers.

The A350 is the world’s most modern and efficient widebody aircraft in the 300-410 seater category. The A350’s includes state-of-the-art technologies and aerodynamics delivering unmatched standards of efficiency and comfort. Its new generation engines and use of lightweight materials bring a 25 per cent advantage in fuel burn, operating costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared to previous generation competitor aircraft.

As with all Airbus aircraft, the A350 is already capable of operating with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Airbus aims for all its aircraft to be 100% SAF-capable by 2030.

At the end of September 2025, the A350 had won more than 1,400 orders from 63 customers worldwide.

,,2025-10-17 14:40:51+00:00,AirInsight,Lufthansa Urges EU to Level Global Aviation Rules | - AirInsight,Rytis Beresnevi?ius,,,,,https://airinsight.com/lufthansa-eu-competition-regulations/,"Lufthansa has continued to advocate for changes in European and German legislation that would, in its view, enable European airlines to compete more effectively against incumbents in other countries and states.
“While direct competitors are expanding at the gates of the EU, European network airlines are experiencing structural competitive disadvantages,” it said.
Lufthansa pointed out that, for example, on flights from Germany to Asia, 37% passengers flew directly, while another 25% transferred in Europe.
“European airlines operate in one of the most heavily regulated jurisdictions in the world.
Departures from Rome Fiumicino Airport (FCO), where Lufthansa Group’s newest hub airline, ITA Airways, is based, are taxed €2,180 ($2,551).","Lufthansa has continued to advocate for changes in European and German legislation that would, in its view, enable European airlines to compete more effectively against incumbents in other countries and states.

The German airline group’s monthly Policy Brief (Politikbrief) newsletter detailed that while airlines should welcome around 5 billion passengers in 2025, profit margins are still low (3.7%). “While direct competitors are expanding at the gates of the EU, European network airlines are experiencing structural competitive disadvantages,” it said.

Lufthansa pointed out that, for example, on flights from Germany to Asia, 37% passengers flew directly, while another 25% transferred in Europe. The remaining 38%, split evenly, were transferred in the Gulf, Turkey, or another country before reaching their final destination in 2010.

By 2024, that had fundamentally changed: 34% passengers now transfer in the Gulf or Turkey, with another 23% stopping elsewhere. 25% travelers are flying non-stops, and the remaining 17% fly with a transfer in Europe.

“Without an active aviation strategy, Germany and Europe are facing increasing pressure in global competition.”

According to the company, airlines from the Gulf region, such as Emirates or Qatar Airways, thrive in the European Union (EU) without having to adhere to the bloc’s regulations. Comparing the operating conditions for Germany, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Lufthansa highlighted that while airlines have to pay aviation taxes in Germany, the same could not be said about Qatar and the UAE.

The same regulatory asymmetry between Germany and Qatar and the UAE is observed in fees (airport or air traffic control (ATC) charges), environmental and consumer protection (such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) quotas or EU261 regulation), and labor protections, including the fact that Germany has employment protections, and citizens can join unions and strike.

Though notably, Qatari law permits Qatari citizens to join unions and strike, yet the country’s working-age population in 2023 comprised 2.3 million non-Qatari citizens and around 229,000 Qatari citizens.

“European airlines operate in one of the most heavily regulated jurisdictions in the world. Constantly new environmental regulations, emissions trading, fragmented airspace, and strict passenger compensation rules are driving up costs for EU airlines ever higher.”

Lufthansa stated that regulatory expenses rose by 11% per year between 2014 and 2024, while passenger numbers increased by only 4% annually during the same period. This includes sustainability-related costs, with the German airline group pointing out that tackling climate change is “a global task.”

While SAF is still scarce and expensive, the current “EU climate policy weakens European airlines and hubs in international competition, as it unilaterally increases the cost of transfers in Europe,” resulting in traffic and emissions shifting to other jurisdictions, rather than being reduced.

For example, as part of the ‘Fit for 55’ package, which aims to reduce the EU’s 2030 emissions by 55% compared to 1990 levels, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation has mandated a minimum SAF blend of 2% of SAF from January 1, 2025, growing to 5% from January 1, 2030.

As a result, because only departing flights from the EU have to adhere to the mandate, transfers in Frankfurt should be at least €180 ($210) more expensive at Frankfurt Airport (FRA) than at Istanbul Airport (IST) in 2035.

Lastly, Lufthansa pointed out the discrepancy between taxes in Germany and the rest of Europe. For example, an Airbus A320 flight with 150 passengers departing FRA to any EU destination is taxed (aviation tax, security fees, and ATC charges) €4,850 ($5,675). Departures from Rome Fiumicino Airport (FCO), where Lufthansa Group’s newest hub airline, ITA Airways, is based, are taxed €2,180 ($2,551).

Lufthansa’s Policy Brief newsletter has been primarily focused on these issues. The newsletter’s September edition said that aviation taxes are the highest in Europe, while in July, the group stated that “no other European country imposes a greater tax burden on flights than Germany.”

When it published its H1 2025 results on July 31, the opening statement of Carsten Sphor, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Lufthansa Group, read that the “disproportionate burden on European airlines due to unilateral EU regulations also continues to put us at a disadvantage in global competition.”

The announcement comes as the UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill, which creates new subsidies for SAF production, progresses to its next stage in Parliament. SAF is a ‘drop-in’ biofuel that is blended with conventional aviation fuel and used in aeroplanes without modification, to reduce the carbon emissions of flying.

By blending customers’ SAF into Exolum’s national aviation fuel pipeline network, the investment will boost green aviation fuel supplies to airports across southern England and Wales, including those at Heathrow, Gatwick, Bristol, Exeter and Cardiff.

The company is also announcing that the facility will be the first of a new UK-wide network of SAF blending hubs it plans as part of its 2,000km pipeline network, creating a SAF Superhighway that will provide SAF producers and importers with market access to the jet fuel for 40% of flights leaving the UK’s airports.

Expected to be operational from 2026, the initial investment at Redcliffe Bay will support the greening of the equivalent of up to 64,741 flights from London to New York a year, supporting the UK’s position as a global leader in green aviation.

The plans will enable long-term green investment in SAF production plants across the UK and, in the case of Redcliffe Bay, south-west of England and southern Wales, by providing a crucial, independent route to market for when they become operational, which is expected later this decade.

Unblended SAF will initially be delivered by ships to Bristol’s Royal Portbury Dock, before being transported to Exolum’s Redcliffe Bay site by pipeline. It will then be stored and blended on-site with conventional aviation fuel, to create the ready-to-use ‘drop-in’ fuel that is then distributed by Exolum’s national pipeline system.

The project includes several infrastructure upgrades to Exolum’s existing aviation fuel pipeline storage and pumping station at Redcliffe Bay, on the banks of the Severn Estuary near Bristol. The plans include:

Conversion of existing aviation fuel storage tanks to handle SAF, before it is blended with conventional aviation fuel.

Within the existing tanks, the installation of a state-of-the-art SAF blending infrastructure, which will ensure that SAF is blended with conventional aviation fuel to the correct technical standards.

Modifying existing systems by installing new pumps, filtration systems and segregation valves to circulate SAF between storage tanks and to pump into the pipeline network.

Exolum North West Europe Lead, Stephen Land, says, “Exolum’s investment at Redcliffe Bay is turning the UK’s ambitions for greener flights into reality, whilst helping secure the country’s world-leading position at the forefront of global sustainable aviation.

“The UK’s twin commitments to airport expansion and to increasing SAF supplies have been crucial in ensuring that, and we’re looking forward to not only supporting greener aviation but also the growth of the UK’s sustainable fuels industry.”

UK Department for Transport Aviation Minister, Keir Mather MP, says, “I’m excited to see the rollout of Exolum’s SAF network, which will help support regional jobs across the country and is another major vote of confidence in our SAF polices including the SAF Bill, which is back in Parliament for its third reading.”

“We’re also investing £63 million to support the production of homegrown SAF which, alongside our mandate to increase the supply of SAF in aviation fuel to UK flights, will drive demand for greener fuels and support jobs in the UK.”",https://theenergyst.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RCB-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 10:57:50.229976

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?

SAF is an alternative to traditional fuel to reduce the carbon footprint of flights

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is an alternative fuel for flights. It is produced from agricultural or forestry waste, or from renewable hydrogen, CO2 captured from the air or industrial processes. Compared to traditional kerosene, SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 80% in terms of life cycle, according to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).

The great advantage of SAF is that it can be used without making any changes to aircraft engines or airport infrastructure. It is therefore currently the viable alternative for reducing part of the emissions in the aviation sector.

Why are we joining this initiative?

Because our commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2040 also includes our value chain. And that means an ESG culture with more sustainable habits on all fronts.

Because, although corporate travel only accounts for 2% of our global indirect CO2 emissions (scope 3), every tonne counts!

Because it is a pioneering proposal that translates into real changes in the decarbonisation of the economy and accelerates the energy transition.",https://www.telefonica.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/circulo-saf.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 10:58:01.652442
