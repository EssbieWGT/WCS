Norfolk Southern runs daily service to and from The Virginia Inland Port (VIP) — The Port of Virginia’s intermodal terminal in Front Royal.
How RailGreen works: • Norfolk Southern’s low-carbon biofuel use in locomotives generates RailGreen certificates.
• As customers purchase certificates, Norfolk Southern acquires more biofuel.
Why it matters: A company’s supply chain emissions are the hardest to track and tackle.","The Port of Virginia is collaborating with Norfolk Southern on its new RailGreen program that reduces supply chain emissions for shippers. With the first-of-its-kind emission reduction program for freight rail connecting to the East Coast’s most sustainable port, shippers now have the nation’s first “RailGreen Corridor” to conduct business.

Where is it? Norfolk Southern runs daily service to and from The Virginia Inland Port (VIP) — The Port of Virginia’s intermodal terminal in Front Royal. VIP connects to The Port of Virginia’s terminals in Norfolk Harbor. Cargo owners using Norfolk Southern’s lane can participate in RailGreen and reduce emissions.

How RailGreen works:

• Norfolk Southern’s low-carbon biofuel use in locomotives generates RailGreen certificates.

• Customers purchase certificates to apply toward their supply chain emissions.

• As customers purchase certificates, Norfolk Southern acquires more biofuel.

Why it matters: A company’s supply chain emissions are the hardest to track and tackle. RailGreen makes it possible. The partnership will contribute to a reduction in Scope 3 emissions on the East Coast.

Collaborative effort: RailGreen builds on Norfolk Southern’s sustainable initiatives like increased biofuel, solar power for rail yards, and hybrid locomotives. The Port of Virginia is the East Coast’s first port to power all terminals with 100% clean energy, and cargo moves there with the lowest emissions on the coast.

What powers RailGreen? Blockchain-backed Environmental Attribute Certificates from 123Carbon – the leading, independent book-and-claim platform – ensure each metric ton of reduced emission is tracked to avoid double counting. Third-party validation verifies carbon-reducing activities against international standards.

What they’re saying:

“Rail is already the most sustainable way to transport goods over land, and we’re not resting on that advantage. By working with The Port of Virginia , we’ve created a green-shipping solution for customers transporting goods to and from the coast.” — Ed Elkins, Norfolk Southern EVP & Chief Commercial Officer

“The goal is to provide cargo owners options. With more and more cargo owners emphasizing their interest in modern, cleaner supply chains, this effort goes right to that point.” — Stephen A.

With regulatory pressure mounting, new technologies on the horizon, and collaboration more vital than ever, the summit offers a unique platform to align ambition with action.

Industry professionals across aerospace, sustainability, finance, and government will come together at Farnborough International Exhibition & Conference Centre, home of the Farnborough International Airshow, to explore practical pathways to decarbonisation.

Here they comment on why attending the summit is essential to shaping aviation’s sustainable future:

Driving Innovation Through Collaboration

Diana Birkett Rakow, SVP, Public Affairs & Sustainability, Alaska Airlines says: “The pace of innovation in and around aviation is incredible, and airlines have made significant progress on operational efficiency and advancing new technologies. But the technologies we need for our industry’s future are still being developed and matured... Forums like Sustainable Skies provide an opportunity to deepen shared understanding of the challenges and opportunities, and to further galvanise action.”

A Platform for Sustainable Leadership

For leaders like Rakow, Sustainable Skies is more than a conference, it’s a space where the future of flight is being co-designed. As promising solutions like hydrogen, electric propulsion, and SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) gain traction, the summit helps bridge the gap between technical promise and industry-wide deployment.

Nichola Bates, managing partner, Aerospace Xelerated & Head of Innovation at Boeing explains: “As an industry, we have a responsibility to ensure that we balance growth with environmental and social responsibility. I look forward to connecting with industry leaders, innovators, and changemakers, working together to build a more sustainable future in aviation.”

Building a Zero-Emission Future

The summit attracts visionaries committed to embedding sustainability into aviation’s DNA. It’s a chance to shape the next generation of solutions by showcasing innovation and forging lasting partnerships and driving cultural change within companies.

Simon Newitt, President & CCO, Heart Aerospace comments: ""Sustainable Skies brings together the visionaries and decision-makers who are actively reshaping the future of aviation. This event is an important platform to share ideas, align on policy, and drive the innovation our industry needs to meet its climate goals.""

Tackling Compliance and Carbon Markets

Heart Aerospace is among a wave of next-gen manufacturers pushing for electrified regional flight. For them, the summit is where alignment happens, between startups, OEMs, regulators, and investors, on what it will take to make zero-emission aviation a reality.

Alexandra Härmatis, Senior Corporate Carbon Trader, Vertis Environmental Finance notes: “With environmental compliance becoming increasingly complex and costly for aircraft operators, we at Vertis are committed to developing innovative products and services that help the industry meet its obligations and navigate the road to decarbonisation.”

Scaling Up Sustainable Aviation Fuel

As market-based measures and carbon trading gain importance, finance and carbon experts play a growing role. Sustainable Skies enables these professionals to collaborate with industry peers and help operators meet stringent environmental requirements.

Olan Ryan, VP SAF, UK & Ireland, IAG: ""While demand signals like SAF mandates are important, stronger policy support is essential to help scale production and close the affordability gap. The conversations at Farnborough will be crucial in helping align industry and government action to make SAF a commercial reality.”

With SAF at the centre of near-term decarbonisation efforts, the summit serves as a high-impact venue to unite suppliers, airlines, and governments around scalable, commercially viable SAF production and uptake.

Data-Driven Decision-Making

Transparency is critical to credibility. Organisations like Estuaire are leveraging data and digital tools to help the industry measure what matters and the summit helps spotlight these efforts.

Maxime Meijers, CEO & Co-founder, Estuaire affirms: ""We’re attending the Sustainable Skies World Summit to elevate the conversation around aviation climate impact. Our goal is to bring clarity to aviation's global footprint and demonstrate how actionable data can lead to better decisions today.""

Shaping the Ecosystem for Zero-Emission Flight

Jenny Kavanagh, Director, Green Skies Consulting explains: “The decarbonisation of aviation is a monumental challenge that will require long-term thinking, strong government policy, and cross-industry collaboration... This event is a valuable opportunity to hear diverse perspectives and to align on the actions needed to deliver a truly sustainable future for aviation.”

Cesar Pereira, Head of Sustainability, Commercial Aviation, Embraer adds: ""Events like this are critical to driving progress on renewable energy, new technologies, and global policy frameworks.”

Kavanagh and Pereira echo the importance of collective vision and multi-stakeholder engagement. From infrastructure to policy, the summit is where progress is accelerated, not just through innovation, but through system-wide alignment.

Whether you’re driving innovation, navigating policy, or scaling solutions, the Sustainable Skies World Summit 2025 is where industry meets purpose. The voices converging at Farnborough share a common goal: to transform aviation from one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonise into one of the most inspiring examples of climate leadership.

More than three-quarters (76 percent) of the 244 readers who responded reported that their feelings have become more negative.
“The uncertainty and tariff policy of the Trump administration is causing my company to pull back resources — people and spending,” wrote one sustainability manager.
Even those working at companies that have maintained their sustainability efforts report having lost the respect, cooperation and resources they need to do their jobs.
“Corporate sustainability has been an uphill paddle ever since I started 25 years ago,” one professional wrote.","If you’re feeling discouraged, frustrated, uncertain or disheartened, you are hardly alone. Last Wednesday, the 100th day of the Trump administration, we asked the Trellis community how their feelings about working in corporate sustainability have changed over the past year. More than three-quarters (76 percent) of the 244 readers who responded reported that their feelings have become more negative.

“I’m proud and determined but angry and frustrated at how much harder and confusing things have become,” one reader replied to our invitation to explain their response. “We have important work to do, and we collectively don’t have time to slow down and be distracted by dealing with the chaos.”

For some, the changes in government policy spurred powerful emotional reactions.

“I feel like I’m 11 years old again, trying to navigate shaky waters as my parents were constantly fighting,” said a corporate social responsibility reporting manager in Arizona. “I just want to do my job and make the world a place we all deserve to live in.”

Others pointed to financial and career insecurity.

“I’m always in suspense, waiting for the next executive order to stab another knife in the work I’ve dedicated my life to,” wrote one consultant. “I feel constantly under pressure from clients asking how to deal with the new administration’s actions.”

‘More determined than ever’

Of readers who reported more positive (10 percent) or neutral (14 percent) feelings about sustainability work, many described growing resolve in the face of a hostile environment.

“I’m more determined than ever to make sustainable changes and help the movement,” said Dawna Mirante, owner of Refill Mercantile. “We need to counter what the other side is doing, and I’m up for it.” (The respondents were invited, but not required, to publish their names with their comments.)

Others reported feeling better because businesses are adopting a more realistic balance between economic and environmental goals.

“I feel like this is an opportunity to reset — to move away from the often-empty slogans and wish casting (and greenwashing) to try to identify sustainability opportunities that make actual business sense,” said Alan Scheller-Wolf, a professor of operations management at the Tepper School of Business of Carnegie Mellon University.

Many more readers, however, said they were deeply disturbed by the administration’s choice to emphasize increased fossil fuel production over mitigating climate change.

“I love working in sustainability and feeling a sense of purpose from my work, but now I feel so much anxiety that all of the progress and hard work will be undone due to short-sighted and misinformed policy choices,” said a typical comment. “I worry that we will no longer be able to prevent major climate catastrophe.”

The great unraveling

Readers also told us that many companies they work for and do business with have slowed or abandoned their efforts to reduce their climate impact, reacting to uncertain economic prospects and the broader backlash against the ESG movement as well as the administration’s change in environmental policy.

“The uncertainty and tariff policy of the Trump administration is causing my company to pull back resources — people and spending,” wrote one sustainability manager. “It feels like many things I’ve been working on are unraveling or becoming inconsequential.”

The experience of working at companies that are scaling back their sustainability efforts evoked many emotions from readers: Anger and disappointment at their leaders, as well as fear for their own job security.

“As we see the politicization of climate change, the financial outflows to sustainability, growing greenhushing and the flip-flopping of CEOs to cozy up to the president and Elon Musk, it makes me feel like my job and the entire practice is at risk,” one reader wrote.

Even those working at companies that have maintained their sustainability efforts report having lost the respect, cooperation and resources they need to do their jobs.

“Corporate sustainability has been an uphill paddle ever since I started 25 years ago,” one professional wrote. “I had been excited that we had finally built legitimacy and momentum, but now I feel like there are forces deliberately trying to sink the boat. “",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Sisyphus-SS-.jpg,N,,2025-05-06 11:56:28.726778

In addition to SAF, the facility generates bio-LPG and bio-naphtha as by-products and is currently undergoing performance testing.
The facility arrives at a critical time, as SAF gains momentum globally for its ability to reduce aviation-related CO₂ emissions by up to 80%.
Bangchak is also preparing to implement a Book & Claim system to support carbon offsetting by passengers and airlines.","Bangchak Group has launched Thailand’s first dedicated production facility for 100% neat sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), marking a major step towards low-carbon aviation in Southeast Asia. Located at the Bangchak Phra Khanong Refinery in Bangkok, the new SAF Production Unit is operated by BSGF Company Limited, an affiliate of Bangchak Corporation.

The fully integrated facility is the first in Thailand to manage the entire value chain—from feedstock procurement to product distribution—under the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) scheme. With an initial capacity of one million litres per day, the plant uses hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) technology to convert used cooking oil and other bio-based feedstocks into high-quality jet fuel that meets ASTM standards.

Bangchak collaborated with Desmet of Belgium, a leader in pretreatment technologies, and UOP Honeywell of the United States, known for its hydroprocessing systems, to ensure performance and quality across all production stages. In addition to SAF, the facility generates bio-LPG and bio-naphtha as by-products and is currently undergoing performance testing.

Group Chief Executive and President Chaiwat Kovavisarach said the launch reflects Bangchak’s transformation from a renewable energy leader to a pioneer of next-generation fuels. The company has been active in biofuels for more than two decades and introduced biodiesel to the Thai market as early as 2004. Through initiatives such as the “Fry to Fly” campaign, Bangchak collects used cooking oil from the public at more than 290 service stations nationwide, with plans to reach 2,000 locations by year-end.

The facility arrives at a critical time, as SAF gains momentum globally for its ability to reduce aviation-related CO₂ emissions by up to 80%.

ATLANTA, May 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Wheels Up Experience Inc. (NYSE: UP), a global leader in private aviation, today announced the launch of its new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) program. Now, Wheels Up charter customers who opt into this initiative are able to seamlessly book a private jet or group charter flight and contribute towards decarbonizing aviation by supporting SAF.

Wheels Up will partner with Delta Air Lines to purchase SAF, ultimately allowing private fliers to participate regardless of their flight operator or departure airport.

What is SAF?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel, derived from more sustainable feedstocks. SAF is developed through advanced processes that significantly reduce its carbon footprint over the fuel's lifecycle, as compared to traditional fossil-based jet fuel.

SAF is significant in its drop-in capability, meaning it can be blended with traditional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft engines without modification. By using SAF in this immediate and practical way, airlines can achieve up to an 80% reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions.

How does this SAF Program work

While SAF is expected to play a critical role in decarbonizing aviation, it remains scarce today – in 2024, it only accounted for 0.3% of global jet fuel production, and it has very limited availability.

In this context, it is impractical to ensure that every customer wishing to 'fly on SAF' has physical SAF at their airport, much less loaded into their specific flights. Through Wheels Up's program, charter customers determine the amount of SAF they wish to support, and Wheels Up coordinates with Delta to direct customer contributions through the Delta SAF Program.

By integrating SAF into Wheels Up's charter infrastructure, Wheels Up and its customers have the opportunity to help increase the demand for SAF. Such market frameworks are anticipated to play a critical role in scaling SAF production and use in the coming years.

To support this initiative, Wheels Up has partnered with Chooose, a leading software platform specializing in lower-carbon aviation solutions.

Commitment to Sustainability

With the launch of this SAF program, Wheels Up is taking a proactive step towards helping to reduce aviation's carbon footprint. This introduction empowers customers to make more sustainable travel choices and contribute towards decarbonizing aviation by supporting SAF.

Jill Greer, Wheels Up's Executive Vice President, Investor Relations and Sustainability, commented:

""We are delighted to launch our Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) program. As demand for ESG-conscious travel options grows, this initiative allows our customers to take meaningful steps toward reducing their carbon footprint, while reinforcing Wheels Up's commitment to sustainable aviation.""

Charlotte Lollar, Director of Sustainable Aviation Fuel at Delta Air Lines, added:

""We are pleased to collaborate with Wheels Up to provide access to Delta's SAF supply. Through this new partnership, we're able to offer charter customers a traceable and scalable way to contribute to reducing aviation emissions - even when traveling in locations where SAF is not readily available. We are excited to continue to propel the industry forward toward more sustainable aviation solutions.""

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel, derived from more sustainable feedstocks. SAF is developed through advanced processes that significantly reduce its carbon footprint over the fuel's lifecycle, as compared to traditional fossil-based jet fuel.

SAF is significant in its drop-in capability, meaning it can be blended with traditional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft engines without modification. By using SAF in this immediate and practical way, airlines can achieve up to an 80% reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions.

How does this SAF Program work

While SAF is expected to play a critical role in decarbonizing aviation, it remains scarce today – in 2024, it only accounted for 0.3% of global jet fuel production, and it has very limited availability.

In this context, it is impractical to ensure that every customer wishing to 'fly on SAF' has physical SAF at their airport, much less loaded into their specific flights. Through Wheels Up's program, charter customers determine the amount of SAF they wish to support, and Wheels Up coordinates with Delta to direct customer contributions through the Delta SAF Program.

By integrating SAF into Wheels Up's charter infrastructure, Wheels Up and its customers have the opportunity to help increase the demand for SAF. Such market frameworks are anticipated to play a critical role in scaling SAF production and use in the coming years.

To support this initiative, Wheels Up has partnered with Chooose, a leading software platform specializing in lower-carbon aviation solutions.

Commitment to Sustainability

With the launch of this SAF program, Wheels Up is taking a proactive step towards helping to reduce aviation's carbon footprint. This introduction empowers customers to make more sustainable travel choices and contribute towards decarbonizing aviation by supporting SAF.

Jill Greer, Wheels Up's Executive Vice President, Investor Relations and Sustainability, commented:

""We are delighted to launch our Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) program. As demand for ESG-conscious travel options grows, this initiative allows our customers to take meaningful steps toward reducing their carbon footprint, while reinforcing Wheels Up's commitment to sustainable aviation.""

Charlotte Lollar, Director of Sustainable Aviation Fuel at Delta Air Lines, added:

""We are pleased to collaborate with Wheels Up to provide access to Delta's SAF supply. Through this new partnership, we're able to offer charter customers a traceable and scalable way to contribute to reducing aviation emissions - even when traveling in locations where SAF is not readily available. We are excited to continue to propel the industry forward toward more sustainable aviation solutions.""

Because we have the capability to deliver our E-Jet® sustainable aviation fuel at scale, Twelve is proudly creating a realistic pathway to carbon-neutral aviation that meets both operational demands and climate goals.”

How Twelve’s Technology Works

Twelve’s advanced technology uses renewable electricity to combine captured carbon from the atmosphere with hydrogen derived from water. This process creates the basic building blocks that can be used to produce not only fuels, but also plastics and other materials. By reducing reliance on fossil fuels, this method significantly lowers the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with fuel production and manufacturing.

The process is sustainable because it uses renewable energy sources, captured carbon, and water as raw materials, offering a clean and scalable solution to one of the aviation industry’s most pressing challenges—its reliance on fossil fuels. This innovative approach is seen as a promising solution for making air travel more sustainable in the long term.

United Airlines’ Sustainable Flight Fund

The investment in Twelve is part of the United Airlines Ventures Sustainable Flight Fund, a first-of-its-kind investment vehicle designed to support startups that are focused on decarbonizing air travel.

Through this RFP, SABA will facilitate 5 to 10-year forward purchasing commitments on behalf of its members at sufficient volumes to support final investment decision (FID) for a new next-generation SAF production facility.

""The SAF market is growing rapidly but the technologies we need to fully decarbonize the aviation sector are still in their infancy,"" said Kim Carnahan, CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation and head of SABA Secretariat. ""Investment needs to happen now if we want these technologies to scale post-2030 and keep the aviation sector on track to meet its long-term net zero goals.""

SAF represents the best near-term opportunity to decarbonize aviation as it is a drop-in fuel that can be used in today's aircraft fleet. Despite significant recent growth, SAF still makes up less than 1% of total aviation fuels used today with the market dominated by SAF made from traditional feedstocks, such as waste oils, that face limitations to scale beyond 2030. SAF with the greatest scalability potential, using feedstocks such as renewable hydrogen, agriculture and forestry residues, and municipal solid waste, is only a small portion of the currently available SAF. Without focused investment today, these fuels may not be available in the quantities needed to meet global decarbonization objectives.

SABA is working with its corporate partners to generate the demand signal needed to give advanced SAF producers confidence to scale production. Through a book and claim model, corporate customers will be purchasing sustainable aviation fuel certificates (SAFc) that allow them to invest in SAF and capture the environmental benefits, even if the fuel does not flow directly into the planes they fly on. The travelers' investment allows them to make a greenhouse gas emissions reduction claim on their climate disclosures, while the physical SAF flows to an aircraft operator.

""Book and claim is the bridge between the aviation industry's sustainable fuel ambitions and scalable real-world production — and SABA is helping build it,"" said Bryan Fisher, Managing Director at SABA co-founder RMI. ""By mobilizing corporate demand and catalyzing investment in cutting-edge fuel production, we can fast-track innovation, expand high-integrity supply, and deliver the climate results the aviation sector urgently needs.""

Since SABA's launch in 2021, it has helped channel approximately $200 million total SAF investment: first through a 2021 proof of concept pilot procurement for a short-term offtake period, followed by 2023-2024's groundbreaking multi-year procurement involving 27 participants and supporting approximately 50 million gallons of SAF. Through the RFP announced today, SABA is targeting longer-term offtakes to help plants get to FID by 2026 and be operational by 2030.

""This RFP is an opportunity for corporate leaders, forward-looking airlines and next generation fuel producers to work together toward a truly net-zero aviation sector,"" said Elizabeth Sturcken, Vice President at Environmental Defense Fund, a SABA co-founder. ""We must be strategic in how we grow the SAF market with environmental integrity so that we can decarbonize the aviation sector without placing new demands on limited feedstocks or land resources that may create new environmental problems.""

By participating in this next-gen procurement, SABA members will be able to meet their emission reduction targets for air travel and air freight through advanced purchases of SAFc connected to next-gen SAF meeting SABA's rigorous sustainability criteria.

SAF suppliers interested in responding to the RFP are encouraged to learn more by downloading the RFP and supporting documentation.

While the RFP announced today is focused on next generation SAF, SABA continues to support its members in purchasing high-integrity commercially available SAF.

About Twelve Twelve™ is the carbon transformation company on a mission to eliminate global emissions and build a net zero future.
SOURCE United Airlines","Twelve's technology is an industrial alternative to photosynthesis to transform carbon and water into inputs for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) – company recently entered into one of the largest SAF contracts with large European airline group for 260 million gallons

United Airlines Ventures Sustainable Flight FundSM continues to augment its investment portfolio with commercially advanced companies that use demonstrated energy pathways

CHICAGO, May 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- United today announced an investment in Twelve, an innovative low carbon fuels company that uses a process similar to photosynthesis to transform CO2 and water into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using renewable energy.

This investment by the United Airlines Ventures Sustainable Flight Fund follows Twelve's $83 million Series C funding round and project financing for its first SAF production facility, AirPlant™ One, located in Moses Lake, Washington. The facility is expected to begin production this year and plans to produce 50,000 gallons of SAF annually.

Last year, Twelve secured a SAF purchase agreement with a large European-based airline company. Under the 14-year contract, Twelve will supply 260 million gallons of SAF to support its five airlines. This long-term agreement, combined with the development of Twelve's first plant, underscores the demand for the company's innovative technology and SAF.

The SAF Twelve plans to produce once its plant becomes operational, is expected to be a lower-carbon alternative fuel with the potential to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 90% compared to conventional jet fuel.

""Scaling the SAF industry is the major hurdle air travel needs to clear in order to increase the supply and reduce the price of lower carbon fuels,"" said Andrew Chang, head of United Airlines Ventures®. ""Twelve has differentiated themselves through the capital they have raised and the SAF contracts they have secured, providing them with the flexibility to commercialize their technology and grow their operations expediently.""

""United's Sustainable Flight Fund's investment reinforces our momentum at a pivotal moment as we move from innovation to implementation,"" said Nicholas Flanders, co-founder & CEO of Twelve. ""With AirPlant One launching imminently and strong a collaboration with United, we're not just envisioning the decarbonization of air travel—we're actively building it. Because we have the capability to deliver our E-Jet® sustainable aviation fuel at scale, Twelve is proudly creating a realistic pathway to carbon-neutral aviation that meets both operational demands and climate goals.""

Twelve's advanced technology uses renewable energy to combine carbon captured from air and hydrogen obtained from water into the basic building blocks that make fuels, plastics and other materials. By using renewable electricity, captured carbon and water, the process reduces the reliance on fossil fuels, lowering lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, including the emissions associated with production of fuels and in manufacturing.

Must-reads on ImpactAlpha

Galvanize’s Tom Steyer on why now is a good time for climate investors with cash (Q&A). As the US dismantles its leadership on climate action at least one committed climate investor smells a buying opportunity. “If there’s a big supplier of capital who has decided, ‘I’m out,’ that’s a good thing,” Tom Steyer, the billionaire turned presidential candidate turned climate tech investor at Galvanize Climate Solutions told ImpactAlpha’s David Bank in his San Francisco office. Hear him out.

How digitalization is – and isn’t – helping small businesses in emerging markets. A survey of 4,000 informal and small businesses in Delhi, Lagos, Addis Ababa, Jakarta and São Paulo suggests that “digital tools can help local low-income businesses survive climate shocks, economic disruptions and rising trade barriers,” says Edoardo Totolo of Accion’s Center for Financial Inclusion. The caveat: “Many of these platforms remain ill-suited to the realities of low-margin enterprises.” Learn more.

Hidden champions: The case for selective green hushing. Facing political headwinds in the US, leading European asset owners are embracing a strategy of “selective green-hushing” – limiting their disclosures to receptive stakeholders while continuing environmental, social and governance practices, as well as diversity, equity and inclusion strategies, explains Johannes Lenhard in VentureESG’s latest column for ImpactAlpha.

With smart policymaking, infrastructure investments, and environmental responsibility, the aviation industry can become not just a domestic success story, but a global one.","The liberalisation of India’s economy in the early 1990s—characterised by policies of liberalisation, privatisation, and globalisation—opened the skies to private airlines, ushering in a new era of growth in both domestic and international air travel. Today, India is the world’s third-largest domestic aviation market, behind only the United States and China. The post-pandemic rebound has been robust, with India overtaking Brazil and Indonesia in passenger traffic. However, despite the impressive recovery and rapid expansion, the aviation industry continues to face severe structural, financial, and operational headwinds that threaten its long-term viability.

Indian aviation industry’s ascent began in earnest when private carriers were permitted to compete with the state-owned Air India. The entry of low-cost carriers like IndiGo, SpiceJet, and Go First democratised air travel, bringing it within reach of India’s burgeoning middle class. By the early 2000s, passenger numbers had surged, driven by rising incomes, rapid urbanisation, and airport upgrades. But this expansion came with cracks.

The 2019 collapse of Jet Airways, once India’s largest private airline, was a wake-up call. Strained by mounting debt, high fuel costs, and the global grounding of Boeing 737 Max jets, Jet’s bankruptcy revealed the fragility beneath the sector’s growth story. The COVID-19 pandemic deepened the crisis: capacity was slashed, employees furloughed, and fare caps imposed—upending revenue models across the board. Yet, recovery is now underway. IndiGo is expanding aggressively, while Air India, now under the Tata Group, is staging a long-awaited revival. But the sector’s core problems remain unresolved.

READ I India’s electronics manufacturing push needs policy stability

Bleeding cash in a high-cost industry

Aviation is among the most capital-intensive industries in the world, and Indian carriers face especially acute cost pressures.

Aviation turbine fuel constitutes 40–50% of airline operating costs. With India importing over 80% of its crude oil, global price fluctuations hit hard. To compound matters, ATF is subject to steep state taxes—up to 30%—making it among the most expensive jet fuels globally.

Most airlines operate on wafer-thin margins and rely heavily on debt to finance fleet expansion. The financial implosions of Jet Airways and Go First illustrate the perils of overleveraging. FY2024 saw collective industry losses of Rs 11,600–13,200 crore ($1.4–1.6 billion), despite a duopolistic market dominated by IndiGo and Air India.

Policy Circle is now on WhatsApp. Click here to join the channel

India’s inadequate maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) facilities force carriers to send aircraft abroad—to Singapore, the UAE, or Europe—raising costs and grounding aircraft for longer periods. High GST (18%) on MRO services and the lack of incentives discourage domestic investment, despite India’s clear potential as an MRO hub.

Regulatory and infrastructure bottlenecks

Nearly 40% of Indian airspace is under military control, leading to circuitous flight paths that increase fuel burn and operating costs.

Metro airports like Mumbai and Delhi are bursting at the seams. Mumbai, operating with a single runway, handles over 45 flights an hour—well above optimal capacity—causing delays and safety risks.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) faces criticism for inadequate enforcement and safety lapses. Operational inefficiencies—from baggage mishandling to avoidable delays—diminish consumer confidence.

The shortage of trained pilots, cabin crew, and technicians is another growing concern. With pilot training costs reaching Rs 1 crore, the talent pipeline remains constrained. Meanwhile, intense competition and stressful working conditions fuel attrition and wage inflation.

While aviation accounts for around 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions, India’s rapidly growing passenger numbers threaten to push that share higher. The adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is key to decarbonising the sector, but uptake remains sluggish. SAF currently costs 3–5 times more than conventional jet fuel, and India lacks large-scale domestic production. Most supply is imported.

The way ahead

Without targeted subsidies or blending mandates, there is little incentive for airlines to switch. In the absence of clear policy direction, SAF adoption remains aspirational rather than actionable. To secure the sector’s long-term future, India must tackle its challenges head-on through targeted reforms and collaborative policymaking.

Policy Circle is now on Telegram. Click here to join the channel.

Build a domestic MRO ecosystem: Reducing GST on MRO services and offering tax breaks can attract private investment. Public-private partnerships should be leveraged to establish India as a competitive MRO hub.

Rationalise fuel pricing: Bringing ATF under GST would harmonise pricing across states and reduce input costs. Airlines should also adopt fuel hedging strategies to cushion volatility.

Expand infrastructure and airspace: Accelerating the UDAN scheme will decongest metros and improve regional connectivity. Phased release of military airspace to civilian use could streamline routing and lower fuel consumption.

Drive sustainability: Scaling up SAF production—using ethanol, non-edible oils, and waste-derived feedstock—should be a policy priority. Airlines must also invest in fuel-efficient aircraft such as the Airbus A320neo or Boeing 787 to reduce emissions.

Strengthen regulation: The DGCA needs to modernise its oversight regime through data-driven audits and AI-based monitoring systems. Enhanced enforcement will be key to restoring public trust and operational reliability.

India’s aviation industry is at a crossroads—buoyed by rising demand yet constrained by persistent inefficiencies. The resilience shown in the post-pandemic phase offers hope, but hope alone is not a strategy. Without structural reforms, the sector risks being caught in a cycle of boom and bust.

With smart policymaking, infrastructure investments, and environmental responsibility, the aviation industry can become not just a domestic success story, but a global one. The skies are promising, but only decisive action will allow this industry to truly take flight.

Freitas developed the COVID guardians programme, who were responsible in monitoring and following up on the measures already implemented for COVID-19 and advising users, employees and other people on compliance with distancing, hygiene and health measures recommended by health authorities. He also developed a COVID booklet with information and guidance for the airport community regarding good hygiene and health practices and led the beginning of the publication of a monthly newsletter with passenger curve information, allowing the planning of reopening and rehiring by commercial stores. Freitas also supported the reduction of OPEX by planning the temporary closure of areas, toilets and equipment in common use and internalising some activities.

Chief Strategy Development Officer

Bangalore International Airport Limited

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Raghunath worked closely with all the aero concessionaires and cargo operators to minimise disruption and provide financial relief to them. The airline marketing team helped launch a historic first route to the U.S. West Coast and the cargo team at BIAL also achieved record numbers over this period, with the airport becoming India’s leading airport for the export of perishables. Despite the impact of COVID-19, Raghunath has led a digital transformation and expansion at BIAL airport, with new initiatives and the deployment of the fully biometric-based self-boarding solution for seamless passenger flow and travel experiences and a process automation and analytics platform. These initiatives amongst many others, meant that the airport won ACI World’s ‘Voice of the Customer’ initiative, which recognised BIAL airports efforts to prioritise their customers during COVID-19. Raghunath has remained a staunch and resilient leader during such an uncertain time and is very much appreciated by his team.

Head of Operations

Cairns Airport

As Head of Operations, Alicia Prince has played a critical role in leading and navigating Cairns Airport through the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, Prince implemented a functional plan to ensure business continuity and staff welfare, segregating front-line operational staff into work teams to avoid interaction between groups, as well as strict sanitisation processes. She ensured that the $55 million domestic Terminal upgrade continued safely despite the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.

She also deployed the COVIDSafe Operation Plan for Cairns Airport, which was endorsed and later commended by Queensland Chief Health Officer. As part of this plan Alicia developed an airport layout to provide physical separation of low risk and high-risk arrivals and initiated increased hygiene and sanitisation protocols. The health and safety of the airport community was paramount to maintaining operations, and in response to this Alicia initiated a COVIDSafe training program for the entire airport community and worked closely with her team to deliver.

As a result of the great work Prince has done to ensure COVID-19 best practices, Cairns Airport was one of the first Australian Airports to be awarded an ACI Global Health Accreditation.

Alicia also led the terminal optimisation project, which assessed and implemented terminal downscales due to the crisis. Significant savings (both financial and environmental) were achieved by reducing the operational footprint of the airport.

Whilst maintaining operations throughout the pandemic was a priority, Alicia ensured her team were kept well informed and engaged. Cairns Airport has a team of 33 volunteers which form part of Alicia’s wider team. To ensure they remained connected and cared for, Alicia and her team created care packages including home-made cakes and personally delivered to each of the volunteers’ houses in a COVIDSafe manner. Alicia demonstrated great leadership throughout the pandemic and continues to do so today. Her clear and transparent communication and collaboration with other Australian Airports and key agencies to ensure best practice and alignment contributed greatly to business continuity. Furthermore, all the above was managed whilst working remotely and juggling home schooling with her two young boys.

Airport General Manager

Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport

Balram Bheodari leads Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport as North America’s most efficient airport, due to his vast knowledge of and astute attention to efficiency in aviation, which has allowed the airport to thrive in the most difficult of markets. Bheodari combines operational expertise, integrity, and selflessness to provide a quality of leadership throughout Atlanta Airport. He oversees all facets of airport governance, including operations and a multi-billion-dollar capital improvement programme, ATLNext, designed to pave the way for Atlanta’s growth over the next 20 years. During COVID-19, Bheodari developed a comprehensive resumption of operations playbook that served to support ATL’s recovery efforts. With guidance from the Federal Aviation Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) amid evolving health and safety guidelines, Bheodari steadfastly encouraged collaboration among stakeholders, team-building among aviation employees, and adaptability in uncertain times. Throughout the pandemic, he participated in daily calls with Airports Council International and other large-hub airports to share best practices as well as information from Washington, D.C. federal offices and the CDC.

He aimed to restore customer confidence and ensure the airport was a healthy facility using COVID-19 safe protocols. Since, the airport achieved Airport of the Year by the Airport Minority Advisory Council (AMAC).

During the height of the pandemic, Bheodari was the most ardent supporter of our mission-critical employees. Having worked his way up through the ranks, he fully appreciates the oftentimes thankless jobs these employees perform that keep the Airport safe and running optimally at all times. Morale never flagged because Bheodari made sure those employees felt valued through hazard pay, special meals, social media posts, intranet spotlight features, and other incentives.

His actions and his directives all reflect his commitment to the three key focus areas of our organisation’s strategic plan: people, purpose and performance.

CEO

Swedavia Airports

Jonas Abrahamsson has shown the strength to steer the company towards its long-term sustainable goals, despite the challenges of COVID-19. Abrahamsson has ensured that Swedavia achieved its net zero target for all ten of the airports in 2020 and has continued to support strategic development and innovation to further the cause of sustainable air travel. During 2020, when passenger numbers where down over 90 per cent and a lot of investments were paused, he decided that investments in the company’s net zero target should proceed, allowing Swedavia to become the first net zero airport group by the end of 2020.

Chief Executive Officer

Budapest Airport

Chris Dinsdale has worked at Budapest Airport since 2015, originally as CFO until March 2021, where he was nominated for the position as CEO. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Dinsdale, as CFO of the airport at the time, fought relentlessly to make sure that the company survived the crisis and worked with great commitment to secure the funding of the airport. For example, a voluntary salary cut for the executives and the founding of the Budapest Airport Foundation, which supports blue collar workers who lost their job during the COVID-19 pandemic.

After being nominated to CEO position in March 2021, Dinsdale continues to work closely with the executive team to create a clear COVID-19 recovery strategy for Budapest Airport. This will also mean that we come out stronger of the pandemic and have a clear focus. Dinsdale is an inspiring true leader who helped us all to cope with the very difficult times of the pandemic and I am convinced that he truly deserves this award.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0297-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-06 07:56:32.590492

SHAH ALAM, May 6 — The organisation of multiple growth sectors under a unified platform at the Selangor International Business Summit (SIBS) 2025 allows the state to present a more holistic economic narrative and enhance its appeal to cross-sector investors.

State executive councillor for investment, trade and mobility Ng Sze Han noted that this year’s summit, to be held in October, will feature two new components — the Selangor Care Economy Summit and the rebranded Selangor Aerospace Summit (SAS).

The move is part of the state government’s strategy to strengthen key economic ecosystems.

“The inclusion of the Selangor Care Economy Summit marks the sector’s formal recognition under SIBS 2025 as a new growth area.

“At the same time, the aerospace segment has been restructured to support the industry’s full value chain through the newly named Selangor Aerospace Summit,” Ng said in a Facebook post today.

SIBS 2025 returns to a single-week format from October 8 to 11 at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre, following its two-part series last year. It will be part of the Asean Summit, and targets over 700 booths, 50,000 visitors and a potential transaction value of RM10 billion.

The Selangor Care Economy Policy, introduced earlier this year, aims to support family members caring for children, the elderly, and people with disabilities, while developing the caregiving workforce and infrastructure.

The policy is anchored on five strategic pillars – regulation, professional training, public-private investment partnerships, innovation, and public education — and sets the foundation for a sustainable care ecosystem.

The inaugural Selangor Care Economy Summit will gather experts in healthcare, social welfare, and community development to shape long-term strategies. It will also showcase flagship initiatives such as MamaKerja, which supports mothers returning to the workforce, and Impak, a programme that has trained over 900 informal caregivers.

Meanwhile, the SAS, formerly known as the Selangor Aviation Show, will transition to an indoor, conference-style format.

First launched in 2021, the event previously featured static aircraft displays at the open-air SkyPark Regional Aviation Centre in Subang.

The new format will focus on trade visitors and industry development, with an emphasis on general and business aviation, especially in maintenance, repair and operations. It will also feature forums on talent development and sustainability, including initiatives to support the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel.

Other than the Selangor Care Economy Summit and SAS, SIBS 2025 will feature four major events — the 11th Selangor International Expo (Food and Beverage), 5th Selangor Investment and Industrial Park Expo, 9th Selangor Asean Business Conference, and the 10th Selangor Smart City and Digital Economy Convention.",https://selangorjournal.my/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1000453096-e1746504526861.jpg,N,,2025-05-06 06:56:09.910774

This will represent an estimated abatement of at least one million tonnes of greenhouse gases, said both companies in a joint statement on Tuesday (May 6).

The partnership was structured to mobilise capital towards high-integrity climate solutions, enhance market transparency and strengthen trust in global carbon credit systems, it added.

Tencent and GenZero said they will prioritise projects in areas where finance is most needed, while also ensuring that the projects deliver co-benefits such as improved livelihood for the local communities near where the projects are implemented.

The carbon credits generated will be from projects that have been verified by international carbon standards developed by Verra or Gold Standard or the carbon crediting mechanism set out in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement – a global treaty seeking to keep global warming under 1.5 deg C by 2050.

This is to ensure that the carbon credits purchased ensure real, measurable, and verifiable emissions reductions and removals.

Both companies said that a core focus of this partnership is to enhance transparency and rebuild trust in international carbon markets. Criticisms over the integrity of carbon credits over the last few years have been plaguing the growth of the market.

Tencent and GenZero will try to de-risk carbon projects by conducting pre-feasibility studies, and strengthen market integrity by deploying monitoring, reporting and verification technologies..

Both parties will also continue to explore opportunities to invest in and scale climate solutions by leveraging their respective networks to identify promising investment prospects that could benefit from co-investment, read the release.

Frederick Teo, GenZero’s chief executive officer, said that its partnership with Tencent will encompass all three of its core investment areas, which are nature-based solutions, technology-based solutions and carbon ecosystem enablers.

The report by Brussels-based T&E on UK aviation emissions notes almost one million flights departed UK airports last year, releasing 34.1 million tonnes of CO2 – 95% of the emissions in 2019 – and it argues the UK emissions trading scheme (ETS) “is failing to regulate” these.
In Europe, airlines paid an estimated £2.7 billion in ETS charges last year as emissions hit 98% of the 2019 level.
Anna Krajinska, T&E UK director, urged the government to extend the scope of the UK scheme “to ensure airlines pay the true cost of their pollution and raise badly needed revenue”.
T&E also called for non-CO2 impacts on climate to be incorporated into the UK ETS, suggesting the scheme has fallen behind the EU’s since Brexit.","CO2 emissions from UK-departing flights are forecast to exceed 2019 levels this year, making London a European emissions “hotspot”, according to a report by transport and environment group T&E.

It highlights the fact that six of the 10 “most-polluting” routes in Europe depart from London, with flights to New York topping the list and departures to Dubai and Singapore in second and third place.

Flights from London to Los Angeles, Doha and Hong Kong also appear in the top 10, with no other airport in Europe appearing more than once.

The report by Brussels-based T&E on UK aviation emissions notes almost one million flights departed UK airports last year, releasing 34.1 million tonnes of CO2 – 95% of the emissions in 2019 – and it argues the UK emissions trading scheme (ETS) “is failing to regulate” these.

It suggests the government could raise “millions in revenues” by extending the ETS, which only applies to domestic flights and those to the European Economic Area, excluding 83% of emissions.

T&E calculates airlines paid £210 million under the UK ETS last year and extending the scheme would increase this to £1.2 billion, saying some of the revenue could be used “to kick-start” sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in the UK.

In Europe, airlines paid an estimated £2.7 billion in ETS charges last year as emissions hit 98% of the 2019 level.

However, T&E estimates the EU ETS would have raised £6.5 billion (€7.5 billion) by eliminating allowances and extending the scheme to flights beyond Europe.

Anna Krajinska, T&E UK director, urged the government to extend the scope of the UK scheme “to ensure airlines pay the true cost of their pollution and raise badly needed revenue”.

T&E also called for non-CO2 impacts on climate to be incorporated into the UK ETS, suggesting the scheme has fallen behind the EU’s since Brexit.

It noted “the EU has begun phasing out free allowances” and an EU review of the scheme in 2026 could “expand the scope to all departing flights”, and urged the UK to “consider a similar revision”.",https://dcxnozgahgy2a.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/077/shutterstock-aircraft-emissions.jpg,N,,2025-05-06 04:56:15.793249

Utilizing specially designed Airbus A350-1000s, the flights will accommodate 238 passengers across four classes, with a focus on premium comfort.

Qantas Airways is set to redefine long-haul air travel with the launch of its groundbreaking ""Project Sunrise"" in 2027. This ambitious initiative will introduce the world's longest non-stop commercial flights, connecting Sydney directly to London and New York. Spanning approximately 17,800 kilometers, the Sydney-London route is expected to take around 20 hours, marking a significant milestone in aviation history.

The Airbus A350-1000, which has been particularly designed to handle ultra-long-haul flights, is the foundation of Project Sunrise. 238 passengers in four classes—First, Business, Premium Economy, and Economy—will be able to travel on each aircraft. Notably, premium seating takes up more than 40% of the cabin, guaranteeing increased comfort on lengthy flights.

First-class suites will feature individual cabins with a 32-inch entertainment screen, a closet, a bed, and a recliner chair. Additional legroom and ergonomic seats will be available in Premium Economy and Economy classes, while business-class travelers may anticipate lay-flat mattresses with privacy walls. To lessen the impacts of extended air travel, a special ""Wellbeing Zone"" will be available to all passengers, offering areas for movement, stretching, and refreshment.

Combating jet lag

Recognizing the difficulties associated with long journeys, Qantas has worked with experts from the Charles Perkins Centre at the University of Sydney to create methods to reduce jet lag. These consist of specially designed lighting patterns for the cabin, tryptophan-rich meals to encourage sleep, and supervised in-flight workouts. To promote passenger mobility and circulation, the Wellbeing Zone will have stretch grips, contoured wall panels, and on-screen workout routines.

Operational considerations

To maintain daily services on these routes, Qantas requires a minimum of three Airbus A350-1000 aircraft, with deliveries expected to commence in late 2026. The airline has been facing quite a few delays due to various regulatory requirements necessitating design modifications for extended fuel capacity. However, despite these challenges, Qantas remained committed to launching Project Sunrise in early 2027.

While Project Sunrise promises unparalleled convenience, it also brings economic and environmental considerations. Operating ultra-long-haul flights is resource-intensive, with increased fuel consumption due to the weight of additional fuel required for non-stop journeys. Qantas aims to offset these factors by utilizing more fuel-efficient aircraft and exploring sustainable aviation fuel options. Ticket prices for these routes are anticipated to carry a premium, reflecting the enhanced services and operational costs involved.

Project Sunrise represents a significant leap forward in connecting distant parts of the globe, effectively shrinking travel time between continents. By eliminating stopovers, Qantas offers passengers a more streamlined and comfortable travel experience. As the airline prepares to embark on this ambitious venture, Project Sunrise stands as a testament to innovation and the evolving landscape of global air travel.

Mike Carey, R-Ohio, and Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, on May 1 introduced legislation that aims to retroactively extend the $1-per-gallon biodiesel blenders tax credit (BTC) and the second-generation biofuel producer tax credit, which provides up to $1.01 per gallon for eligible fuels.
Both tax credits expired at the end of 2024 and have been replaced by the technology-neutral 45Z clean fuel production tax credit, which came into effect this year.
It would also allow time for the Trump administration to propose and finalize regulations implementing the 45Z credit.
Farmers can’t sell their beans to crushers, who can’t sell their soybean oil to biodiesel producers, who can’t sell their fuel to distributors and byproduct to glycerin refiners.
So, this doesn’t just impact biodiesel producers—several separate industries are involved in the value chain, and they’re all being devastated by the biodiesel industry being shut down by government inaction.”","Reps. Mike Carey, R-Ohio, and Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, on May 1 introduced legislation that aims to retroactively extend the $1-per-gallon biodiesel blenders tax credit (BTC) and the second-generation biofuel producer tax credit, which provides up to $1.01 per gallon for eligible fuels.

Both tax credits expired at the end of 2024 and have been replaced by the technology-neutral 45Z clean fuel production tax credit, which came into effect this year. The Treasury Department’s delay in releasing full 45Z guidance, however, is negatively impacting U.S. biofuel producers. The bill, H.R. 3079, aims to provide more certainty to biofuel producers by enacting a two-year extension of the expired tax credits. Language included in the bill would prevent taxpayers from claiming both the 45Z and legacy credits for the same gallon of fuel.

The BTC provides up to $1 per gallon for eligible biobased diesel fuels, including renewable diesel. The second-generation biofuel producer tax credit provides up to $1.01 per gallon for eligible fuels produced from cellulosic or algae-based feedstocks, including cellulosic ethanol produced from corn kernel fiber.

“Biodiesel is a homegrown resource that can support our long-term energy independence and support farmers, producers, and energy workers right here in Ohio,” Carey said. “With America’s energy dominance at stake, we’re working to strengthen our supply of biodiesel for years to come.”

“Iowa’s biofuels production fuels America and powers our economy,” Miller-Meeks said. “Iowa producers need market certainty to continue producing affordable, low-emissions forms of energy. I am thankful for Rep. Carey’s collaboration on this commonsense bill which will lower energy costs and emissions, and promote the production of biofuels to further President Trump’s America First agenda for energy dominance. I look forward to getting this bill to his desk.”

The bill has earned support from the American Trucking Associations, Clean Freight Coalition, Energy Marketers of America, Illinois Soy Association, National Association of Convenience Stores, National Energy & Fuels Institute, NATSO, Representing America’s Travel Centers and Truck Stops, Renewable Fuels Association, Sustainable Advanced Biofuels Refiners, SIGMA: America’s Leading Fuel Marketers, National Tank Truck Carriers, and Truckload Carriers Association.

“The expiration of the biodiesel blenders tax credit (40A) along with the lack of implementing regulations on Section 45Z have effectively shut the biodiesel industry down for all of 2025, with no end in sight,” said Joe Jobe, CEO of the SABR Coalition. “This bill to extend 40A would turn the markets back on immediately because the implementing regulations for 40A are already in place and the markets understand them.”

According to the SABR Coalition, the two-year tax credit extension proposed by the legislation would provide time for Congress to fix fundamental flaws in the 45Z credit. It would also allow time for the Trump administration to propose and finalize regulations implementing the 45Z credit.

“The biodiesel industry is in a world of hurt,” Jobe said. “It’s not just the biodiesel industry that is largely shut down, but the entire value chain is shut down. Farmers can’t sell their beans to crushers, who can’t sell their soybean oil to biodiesel producers, who can’t sell their fuel to distributors and byproduct to glycerin refiners. And those fuel distributors can’t sell their fuel to truck-stop operators, and glycerin refiners can’t sell their refined material to numerous, wideranging industries that rely on it for their products, including sewage treatment plants that use glycerin and enzymes in their water treatment processes. So, this doesn’t just impact biodiesel producers—several separate industries are involved in the value chain, and they’re all being devastated by the biodiesel industry being shut down by government inaction.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Mike_Carey2025_1feaa47f12.jpg,N,,2025-05-06 02:56:37.307938

From €5 to SDGs: How Goparity empowers everyday sustainable investors Goparity was founded in Lisbon in 2017 by Nuno Brito Jorge, Manuel Nery Nina, and Luis Couto.
Goparity democratises access to sustainable finance by connecting investors with projects that align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
This framework enables efficient micro-investment management, allowing people to start investing in sustainable projects with just €5.","Traditional financial systems often prevent everyday individuals from investing in initiatives that create a positive social and environmental impact. Sustainable investing is typically accessible only to large institutional investors or wealthy individuals, leaving most people with limited options to align their finances with their values. Goparity breaks down these barriers by enabling anyone to contribute as little as €5 (or similar small amounts in other markets). This approach allows a broader population to fund initiatives that support the United Nations’ SDGs.

Today, the Portuguese sustainable finance platform in Spain and Canada has closed a new investment round of €2.9M. The round was led by 3XP Global through its Impact Innovation Fund, with support from Mustard Seed Maze, Schneider Electric, Energy Access, Regenerative.eco, and InvestEco Capital Corp as institutional investors, whose combined contribution exceeded €2.4 million.

This marked the second time the Portuguese startup opened an investment round to its investor community through an equity crowdfunding campaign (via Crowdcube). The campaign allowed individuals to invest under the same terms as institutional investors. The campaign attracted over 800 private investors, who contributed €470,000.

Nuno Brito Jorge, CEO and co-founder of Goparity, says: “Completing a capital round for a purpose-driven company like ours in such a challenging international context, while bringing together diverse national and international reference investors with our community, is the best validation we could have. In 2024, we had our best year, and we’re likely to surpass €50 million in investments by mid-2025.”

“Impact investing is now more crucial than ever. In just six weeks, between December 2024 and January 2025, the six largest banks in America and four of the largest banks in Canada left the UN’s Net Zero Banking Alliance. We’ll keep working to direct money where it can make a difference through positive impact on people and the planet,” he added.

From €5 to SDGs: How Goparity empowers everyday sustainable investors

Goparity was founded in Lisbon in 2017 by Nuno Brito Jorge, Manuel Nery Nina, and Luis Couto. The founders merged their expertise in renewable energy, technology, finance, and marketing, united by their commitment to sustainability and ethical finance. They created Goparity after struggling to find an ethical bank for their deposits. This challenge inspired them to build a platform that helps people invest in ways that create positive social and environmental impact, avoiding industries that conflict with their values.

Goparity democratises access to sustainable finance by connecting investors with projects that align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By making impact investing accessible to everyone, not just institutional or wealthy investors, Goparity promotes a more balanced, sustainable, and inclusive economic system.

Goparity’s mission is to help people and organisations use their money for good through transparent, ethical investments that offer fair returns while funding sustainable projects. The company ensures that finance serves both people and planet, helping bridge the sustainability funding gap and enabling users to shift from harmful industries to greener, fairer alternatives.

User-friendly financial interface powers micro-investment platform

Goparity distinguishes itself in the growing impact investing and crowdlending sector through its combination of technological innovation, accessibility, and commitment to sustainability. At its core, an advanced e-wallet system lets users deposit, invest, and reinvest funds effortlessly.

This framework enables efficient micro-investment management, allowing people to start investing in sustainable projects with just €5. The platform’s comprehensive ledger system ensures transparent and secure tracking of all transactions, repayments, and investments. Strong regulatory compliance and partnerships with trusted payment providers keep users’ funds safe.

Unlike many competitors, Goparity focuses exclusively on projects that align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This commitment means every euro invested creates tangible social or environmental benefits. Goparity stands out through its international reach. In contrast, others focus on local or single-sector projects. Goparity supports initiatives across continents and sectors, including renewable energy, rural development, and social entrepreneurship. The company builds community by promoting financial literacy, gender diversity, and offering educational content, attracting many young and female investors.

A key innovation is Goparity’s convertible loans—debt instruments that can become equity, rare in European crowdlending. The platform offers user-friendly automation tools like auto-invest and savings plans, helping investors manage portfolios efficiently while maximising both financial and impact returns. Transparency remains central, with transparent reporting on economic performance and project impact fostering user trust.

In the competitive landscape, Goparity stands alongside firms like Fundeen, Abundance Investment, Trine, and Mintos, each specialising in areas from renewable energy to real estate and peer-to-peer lending. However, these platforms often require higher minimum investments, use less sophisticated systems, or offer broader, less impact-focused project selections. Goparity’s low entry barriers, SDG-aligned focus, advanced technology, and engaged community position it firmly in the market.",https://techfundingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Goparity-team.png,N,,2025-05-06 04:56:18.252838

Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg said the official visit to Airbus headquarters had opened the door to six key areas agreed upon for joint exploration, aimed at establishing Sarawak as a new aerospace hub in the Asia-Pacific region.

Among these areas is the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with Sarawak actively conducting research to produce SAF in alignment with global goals of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

“The second focus is human capital development in the aerospace industry, with cooperation between Airbus and local institutions such as ICATS to be expanded to develop aerospace-related training programmes and curricula.

“This initiative will provide Sarawak students with opportunities for international-standard industrial training,” he said at a press conference following a working visit to the Airbus Campus and the headquarters of ATR, a leading global turboprop aircraft manufacturer, on Monday (May 5).

He added that the third area agreed upon is the development of a supporting industry ecosystem.

Abang Johari explained that Sarawak will also explore the potential for manufacturing composite materials and gas-based synthetic leather for aviation use, as well as avionics technologies and instrumentation related to AI-based smart chips.

“The fourth area is the digitalisation of travel and aviation services, with the concept of a ‘digital journey’ to be introduced.

“This is intended to integrate all travel-related services — from flight ticket booking and ART transport systems to accommodations — into one seamless digital package,” he said.

Meanwhile, he said the fifth area agreed upon is the establishment of a Sarawak-Airbus Joint Task Force to formulate a roadmap for the development of Sarawak’s aerospace industry, involving expertise from both sides.

“A team will be formed from our side, while Airbus will also establish its own team. This initiative aims to create a synergy of expertise in the industry through comprehensive cooperation and discussions among experts.

“This effort is expected to catalyse the growth of the aviation industry, opening new opportunities for the sector’s advancement at the international level,” he said.

The sixth area, according to the Premier, involves the development of an Aerotropolis to further strengthen the aviation industry in the state.

“The state government plans to develop a 100-acre site for the Aerotropolis — an integrated hub where all constructed buildings are interconnected, making it more efficient and supportive of the aviation industry ecosystem,” he said.

One of the goals of the initiative, says Ortigara, is to make biomethane economically viable. “Paraná is already the largest producer of animal protein in Brazil, so we want to take advantage of the potential that already exists here to promote the biogas and biomethane chain.

“Aviation has always been synonymous with innovation, connecting people and cultures across the globe. Today, however, the industry faces an unprecedented challenge: balancing its role as a driver of global connectivity with the need to drastically reduce its environmental impact. After over 30 years working in aviation, I’ve witnessed firsthand how sustainability is reshaping aviation, particularly in luxury private aviation—a sector often scrutinized for its carbon footprint. This commentary explores the progress made, the road ahead, and how Azzera is empowering operators to embrace a greener future.

The State of Sustainable Aviation

The aviation industry contributes approximately 2% of global CO2 emissions, with private aviation accounting for a smaller fraction— about 0.04%. Despite this relatively modest share, private aviation’s environmental impact is increasingly under the microscope due to its high per-passenger emissions. Between 2019 and 2023, emissions from private jets rose by 46%, driven by post-COVID recovery and growing demand in emerging markets. This underscores the urgency for sustainable solutions.

The reality is that business aviation has a remarkable history of innovation in fuel efficiency. Over the past 40 years, fuel efficiencies have improved by 40% (NBAA). These advancements reflect the industry’s commitment to reducing its environmental footprint without compromising performance or luxury.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has emerged as a cornerstone of decarbonization efforts. It can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 85% compared to conventional jet fuels (depending on the feedstock used). Driven mainly by the recent ReFuelEU compliance requirements, European operators are investing heavily in SAF to power flights, athough challenges remain regarding feedstock availability and lifecycle analysis, leading to debates about long-term supply. Despite these concerns, SAF remains the most viable solution for immediate emission reductions without requiring fleet overhauls or extensive infrastructure changes.

When SAF availability is limited for uplift at certain locations, the «Book-and-Claim» system offers an innovative solution to scale production by providing a demand signal to producers while enabling immediate emission reductions. Business aviation is uniquely positioned as a key market for this approach, given its clientele’s willingness to support innovation.

Looking further ahead, electric aircraft and hybrid propulsion systems are gaining traction, yet entry into service is not immediate. Innovations like Bye Aerospace’s eFlyer 800 and Luxaviation’s partnership with Lilium for eVTOLs demonstrate promising advancements in regional and short-haul travel. While long-haul electric aviation remains a distant goal due to technological limitations, these developments signify a significant willingness to shift toward fossil fuel independence.

Operational efficiencies also play a pivotal role in reducing emissions today. AI-driven maintenance systems in jets like Bombardier’s Global 7500 optimize fuel use, while eco-friendly interiors crafted from natural fibers balance luxury with sustainability. These measures not only reduce environmental impact but also enhance cost-effectiveness—a crucial consideration as carbon compliance costs rise.

Azzera’s Contribution: Simplifying Sustainability

When I founded Azzera in 2021, my vision was clear: make sustainability accessible and actionable for the aviation ecosystem. Many industry players were eager to reduce their carbon footprint but struggled with regulatory complexities like the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). This inspired CELESTE, a cloud-native platform designed to streamline emissions management and compliance while mitigating the risks of non-compliance.

CELESTE integrates seamlessly with flight scheduling software to calculate emissions in real time, categorizing them into the appropriate compliance markets. By automating processes, it significantly reduces workload and the financial risk of noncompliance, allowing operators to focus on delivering exceptional service. For charter companies, CELESTE’s Fly Beyond feature offers clients an effortless way to incorporate SAF, as well as invest in highquality carbon credits through an automated quote system, ensuring transparency without compromising luxury standards.

Azzera’s patented Impact Score system elevates carbon credit selection by evaluating projects on technical and financial criteria. This ensures operators can purchase high-quality credits with the best price-to-quality ratio while avoiding greenwashing risks. CELESTE also supports SAF adoption with tools like Book-and-Claim systems and usage monitoring, helping operators meet ReFuelEU mandates and advance toward net-zero goals.

The Road Ahead

Sustainable aviation is not merely about meeting regulatory requirements; it’s about transforming the industry into a model of environmental stewardship. According to a recent Jetcraft study, the share of buyers under 45 has nearly doubled in the last decade to a record 29% in 2024. These owners are increasingly demanding carbon-neutral options. Another study from 2023 showed that 85% of travelers were willing to pay a premium for sustainable flight. The drive towards sustainability in aviation does not only come from external factors. The industry is attracting new talent, paving the way towards change. European initiatives like Clean Sky 2 and Horizon 2020 have been funding research into cleaner technologies, while companies like Airbus and Rolls Royce offer internships focused on sustainability. Universities such as Delft University of Technology are preparing students for careers in green aerospace engineering, reflecting a generational shift toward eco-conscious innovation",https://ultimatejet.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Capture-decran-2025-05-05-a-17.10.42.png,N,,2025-05-05 20:56:40.007036

ANZ announces new 2030 emissions guidance

Air New Zealand has published its first 2030 Emissions Guidance and says it expects to reduce net “well-to-wake” greenhouse gas emissions from jet fuel by 20 to 25 per cent by 2030, from a 2019 baseline. This new approach replaces the airline’s 2030 Science Based Target which it withdrew from in 2024. The new 2030 Emissions Guidance aims to provide a regular and transparent assessment of Air New Zealand’s progress towards its 2050 net-zero carbon emissions target. The Emissions Guidance will be updated annually in August in the airline’s Climate Statement. Each update will reflect the airline’s expected net emissions by 2030 based on detailed modelling of its decarbonisation progress, external market conditions, and global and domestic policy developments.

Chief Sustainability and Corporate Affairs Officer Kiri Hannifin, says Air New Zealand is acutely aware of aviation’s impact on the climate and nature, and is committed to high levels of transparency in a rapidly evolving environment. “Air New Zealand remains committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and we are taking practical steps today towards achieving that ambition. Having a comprehensive and annually updated outlook of our emissions trajectory to 2030, and a clear understanding of how we can get there, is a critical stepping stone. Rather than setting an emissions target that remains static, regular emissions guidance will give our investors and customers an up-to-date and clear view of our expected emissions trajectory, including the impact from external risks and opportunities. The reality of decarbonising an industry like aviation is there is uncertainty and are many factors we have limited control over, such as the availability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at reasonable prices. Many of our assumptions are evolving rapidly.

In developing the 2030 Emissions Guidance, Air New Zealand has undertaken a thorough analysis of the airline’s specific circumstances, external environment, and key decarbonisation levers:

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF): increasing use as global mandates, supply and affordability scale.

Fleet and network optimisation: implementing the airline’s fleet and network plan, including continued fleet renewal to replace older aircraft with more fuel-efficient aircraft.

Operational efficiency improvements: improving fuel efficiency through technology and best practice.

Carbon credits: using carbon credits to meet international regulatory requirements (specifically CORSIA, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), and to a lesser extent using high integrity carbon removals.

There are no anticipated decarbonisation impacts from Next Generation Aircraft in the period to 2030.

The 2030 Emissions Guidance is integrated with the airline’s long-term fleet and network plan through to 2030 and will be updated in August each year as part of its Climate Statement.",https://asianaviation.com/wp-content/uploads/AOUjkZHhekVLlsMOmAEmWFdlsYcPWSMEjQVQJnvrnUlyPoAqBFjJqJRhPHpDByYM-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-05 18:56:39.608537

Activities in Green Fuel Forward’s pipeline to spur demand for SAF include workshops and practical guidance tools to help organisations navigate key topics such as environmental integrity, book-and-claim systems, and reporting practices for SAF and SAF certificates (SAFc). Green Fuel Forward participants will also have the opportunity to learn how to undertake a test purchase of SAF and/or SAFc in compliance with competition law, as a hands-on exercise.

Laia Barbarà, Head of Climate Strategy, World Economic Forum, said: “We are thrilled to expand the World Economic Forum’s aviation decarbonisation efforts by creating a targeted program to unlock Asia-Pacific’s immense potential. Green Fuel Forward will complement our well-established and ongoing Airports of Tomorrow and First Movers Coalition activities, increasing knowledge sharing, empowering organisations to procure SAF and creating additional networking opportunities for our local partners and stakeholders.”

Asia-Pacific is a prime market for scaling SAF due to its rapidly growing aviation sector, abundant feedstock resources for green fuel production, and increasingly favourable government and industry support. Singapore, Australia and Japan are among the regional countries implementing supportive policy initiatives to encourage faster decarbonisation in the aviation sector. Examples include Singapore’s Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint. It is important to leverage this emerging regulatory environment as well as the purchasing power of private sector organisations to boost demand for SAF. This, in turn, will drive the supply of greener jet fuel while reducing carbon emissions and increasing energy security.

Frederick Teo, CEO, GenZero, said: “The Asia-Pacific region has a unique opportunity to lead in sustainable aviation fuels, but unlocking this potential requires stronger demand signals.

Mixing cultivated fats with cultivated protein, or even vegan protein, could make meat substitutes more palatable and appealing to consumers.
Palm oil alternatives from Savor, NoPalm, and other companies could reduce reliance on palm oil from plantations.
Speeding up the adoption of alternative fats, particularly cultivated fats, would require faster regulatory approvals as they help build consumer and investor confidence.
Synthetic biology is heralding a future where fats don’t come with a side of deforestation.","The world has a seemingly insatiable appetite for fats. Beyond food production, tallow is used as a fuel, industrial lubricant, and raw material for various industrial chemicals. Palm oil, derived from palm trees in large monoculture plantations, has applications in food, personal care, pharma, and textiles, among other sectors.

But this high demand for fats comes at a massive ecological cost. “Livestock farming for tallow and lard drives deforestation, consumes vast amounts of water and feed, and generates significant greenhouse gas emissions,” said Sonalie Figueiras, a food futurist and founder and editor-in-chief of impact media platform Green Queen. Similarly, she added, “Palm oil production has led to massive habitat destruction in Southeast Asia.”

Figuerias is also Chair of the Food and Ag Track at SynBioBeta: The Global Synthetic Biology Conference, taking place this week at the San Jose Convention Center. She created a session to address this very topic entitled “The Lipid Problem: How Synbio Can Help Make Oil & Fat Supply Chains Deforestation-Free,” in which several commentators in this article will be participating.

Now, in a bid to mitigate these impacts, companies are using synthetic biology to produce animal and plant fat alternatives with a considerably lower footprint.

Producing Fats Without Agriculture

Compared to proteins, fats are simpler molecules. For instance, fat molecules have one or no chiral centers, which makes them structurally more straightforward. This means they can be produced with simple, non-biological reactions. “We have a lot of tools for combining carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen to make all kinds of other molecules, but we don't specifically combine them on our own to make food,” said Kathleen Alexander, CEO of San Jose-based startup Savor.

For example, carbon dioxide captured from the air has been turned into fuels, alcohols, and plastic precursors using heat. Savor uses this thermosynthetic approach to make fats from scratch. Their technology takes carbon dioxide or methane and water and converts them into intermediate molecules like syngas and, eventually, long-chain synthetic hydrocarbons. “We transform those hydrocarbons into fatty acids and then fats and oils,” said Alexander.

Many microbes are oleaginous, which means they produce excess lipids. Companies like Dutch biotech NoPalm Ingredients are augmenting the fat-producing capabilities of these microbes to turn them into a sustainable fat source. “We use directed evolution to improve the performance [of oleaginous yeast strains] and do some strain optimization,” said NoPalm CEO Lars Langhout.

“We create palm oil without palm trees by fermenting food industry side streams using yeast,” said Langhout. This makes their method circular and, in combination with deploying the kind of fermenters used in breweries, keeps capital expenditures low. Langhout added that their technology reduces carbon emissions by 96% and land use by 99% while achieving cost parity with traditional palm oil production.

Cultvated fat is another approach for sustainable fat production. Just like cultivated protein is grown with muscle cells, fats can be grown by culturing adipocytes or fat cells. Precursor cells are isolated from an animal, coaxed to differentiate into adipocytes, and nourished in bioreactors.

“Startups like Hoxton Farms and Mission Barns specialize in growing fat cells, which mature much faster than muscle cells, reducing production time and costs,” said Figueiras. “Cultivated fat also allows for precise control over marbling and composition, enabling premium products like lab-grown wagyu beef.“ Unlike air-captured or fermented fats, which are being developed to replace traditional fats in different sectors, research on cultivated fats is primarily limited to dietary applications.

Sustainable Fats For Food And More

Although cultivated meat has been generally regarded as synonymous with cultivated protein, fats are also an important aspect of meat. The fat content contributes to the nutritional benefits and sensory experience of eating meat. Fat gives meat its juiciness, tenderness, and distinct flavor. Mixing cultivated fats with cultivated protein, or even vegan protein, could make meat substitutes more palatable and appealing to consumers.

However, “If you want to produce a fat that mimics animal fat, you'd need to produce a similar fatty acid profile,” said Langhout. While NoPalm doesn’t serve this niche, their fermentation platform is flexible to make fatty acids mimic animal-derived fat. The simpler chemical structure of fats means that tweaking their production is convenient, regardless of the technology.

Unlike proteins, fats also see wider use in the industry. This is both an advantage and an opportunity. “You can tap into a broad set of markets and a broad set of functional properties that people are looking at from fats and oils,” said Alexander. For instance, Savor produces milkfat, cocoa butter, and alternatives to beef tallow and palm oil. NoPalm also makes alternative fats for food and personal care use cases.

Palm oil alternatives from Savor, NoPalm, and other companies could reduce reliance on palm oil from plantations. Likewise, animal-free fats could be used in drug delivery systems or nutritional supplements. Moreover, “The biofuels sector is exploring cultivated lipids as sustainable aviation fuel. There’s also potential in biomaterials, where fat-derived polymers could replace petroleum-based plastics,” said Figueiras.

Deforestation-Free Fat Supply Chains

When it comes to public dietary perception, protein occupies a haloed space unmatched by fats or carbohydrates. This is likely part of the reason why the alternative proteins received greater interest before alternative fats, despite the latter being easier to synthesize. But this also means that the ecological impact of fat supply chains receives less interest as compared to that of raising livestock for meat.

Deforestation due to palm oil plantations and other plant and animal sources of fats has wide-ranging ecological impacts. The loss of habitat exacerbates biodiversity losses and greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable fat alternatives could change that. Speeding up the adoption of alternative fats, particularly cultivated fats, would require faster regulatory approvals as they help build consumer and investor confidence. ”Cost reductions through scaling up fermentation and bioreactor technologies and off-take agreements with the big FMCG companies will also be critical,” said Figueiras.

However, such agreements, Langhout noted, represent a chicken-and-egg problem for the upcoming sustainable fat alternatives industry. “Our customers want large volumes. But the investors, to enable us to build such volumes, want to see off-take agreements,“ said Langhout. Thankfully, there have been positive developments in the space recently. NoPalm partnered with FMCG Colgate-Palmolive to create soaps out of fermentation-derived palm oil alternatives, and Savor launched its butter made from air.

As customers expect more eco-friendly alternatives and the technologies scale up, more companies will launch products made with air-captured, fermented, and cultivated fats.

World Resources Institute urges U.S. policymakers and businesses to exclude corn and soybean fuels from plans to decarbonize aviation.

Industry places both sources at the heart of expansion of sustainable aviation fuel use.

State and federal regulators will likely be the key arbiters that shape company decisions.

For business flights that can’t be avoided, there’s only one near-term mitigation option: Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a lower-carbon alternative to fossil jet fuel.

Scaling SAF is the focus of the global strategy to decarbonize aviation, but researchers at the World Resources Institute (WRI) are urging a rethink of how the U.S. plans to do so. In a new report, the WRI team argues that when a more holistic approach is used to assess SAF production, two crops that are essential to scaling supply — corn and soy — are found to create more emissions than conventional fossil fuels.

The crops “are not a viable strategy for decarbonizing aviation,” said Audrey Denvir, a WRI research associate and an author of the report.

SAF advocates disputed the report’s conclusions, saying the researchers failed to distinguish between global averages and data on more sustainable biofuel crops grown in the U.S.

Scaling supply

Almost all SAF is currently produced from used cooking oil and other inedible biomass, and is broadly agreed to lead to real carbon savings when it displaces fossil jet fuel. But current production is tiny: The U.S. produces around 1 percent of the quantity needed to hit a government target of 3 billion gallons of domestic production by 2030, according to a 2024 Department of Energy report.

With limited additional waste oil available, the industry in the U.S. is relying on purpose-grown soy and corn to drive near-term growth. “Purpose-grown crops could constitute the majority of the supply within 6 to 10 years,” estimated Adam Klauber, who oversees sustainability and digital supply chains at World Energy, an SAF producer.

To qualify as SAF, fuels produced from these crops need to emit no more than 50 percent of the emissions from fossil jet fuel. Many in the industry say they do, but the\ researchers argue that assessment rests on faulty accounting.

In a report released last week on how biomass can be used to decarbonize the U.S. economy, the researchers used a metric called “carbon opportunity cost” to calculate spillover impacts of fuel crops. As global demand for food grows, dedicating land for this purpose leads to forests and other native ecosystems being converted to agriculture, releasing additional emissions in the process. The fuels “actually increase emissions once you really account for all of the land use,” said Denvir. The European Union already excludes most biofuel crops from its SAF targets for similar reasons.

‘Context is everything’

Industry figures questioned key details of the analysis. Klauber argued that relying on global averages for the impacts of biofuel crops overlooks the higher performance of crops grown in the U.S. “Context is everything,” he said. In the case of soy production, for example, Klauber said the researchers used a carbon intensity figure that was several times higher than the one other academic and environmental organizations use.

Specific farming practices are also critical, he added. For example, biofuels can be grown either alongside and simultaneously with food crops, or during the shoulder season on either side of them. “That is broadly accepted as a sustainable practice, but it’s not yet at commercial scale,” said Klauber. “We’re working to increase that, because that really will be a way to increase the productivity of land without impacting food.”

A handful of organizations hold sway in determining which argument should govern growth of SAF in the U.S. The federal government, which oversees a clean energy tax credit known as 45Z that can apply to SAF, is unlikely to back more stringent environmental rules under the current administration. Regulators such as the California Air Resources Board also control certification schemes for SAF.

“The larger problem is on the demand side where business customers and buyers’ groups might exclude specific allowable feedstocks from contracts based on the perceived-negative public perception regarding soy or corn,” noted Klauber.",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Shutterstock-Image-2463328421.jpg,N,,2025-05-05 17:56:30.713362

He announced a 100 per cent tariff on such movies, saying the US movie industry was dying a “very fast death” due to the incentives that other countries were offering to draw American film-makers.

“This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

He also said he was authorising the relevant US government agencies such as the Department of Commerce to immediately begin the process of imposing a 100 per cent tariff on all films produced abroad that are then sent into the United States.

Trump added: “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!”

In a post on X, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said: “We’re on it.”

Neither Lutnick nor Trump provided any details on the implementation. It was not immediately clear whether the move would target production companies, foreign or American, producing films overseas.

Film and television production in Los Angeles has fallen by nearly 40 per cent over the last decade, according to FilmLA, a non-profit that tracks the region’s production.

Meanwhile, governments around the world have offered more generous tax credits and cash rebates to lure productions, and capture a greater share of the US$248 billion that Ampere Analysis predicts will be spent globally in 2025 to produce content.

The post by Trump comes after he has triggered a trade war with China, and imposed global tariffs which have roiled markets and led to fears of a US recession.

Former senior Commerce official William Reinsch, a senior fellow with the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said retaliation against Trump’s foreign movies tariffs would be devastating.

Latin America’s skies may soon soar greener—but only if governments ground the cost crisis before it crashes connectivity. A powerful new study, funded by LATAM Airlines Group and Airbus, and conducted by the MIT Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy, has sounded the alarm: Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) are the future of decarbonized flight—but that future comes with a hefty price tag.

The study zeroes in on Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru—countries central to Latin America’s aviation lifeline. Together, they represent a complex landscape of potential, urgency, and risk. The MIT analysis reveals a stark truth: SAF will be the primary engine driving aviation toward net-zero, but if nations fail to act together, travel across the region may soon become unaffordable for millions.

Sustainability Takes Flight—But Costs Could Ground It

Fossil fuels currently make up 40% of airline operating expenses in Latin America. Replacing them with SAF could increase those costs significantly. And airlines can’t bear that burden alone.

“Without supportive public policies, SAF will drive up travel costs and reduce demand,” warns the study. The consequences? Fewer passengers, slashed routes, and weakened economic links between cities, countries, and communities. In regions where air travel is the only feasible connection—such as remote parts of the Andes or Amazon—this could fracture entire economies.

SAF as a Lifeline, Not a Luxury

Still, there’s hope. The study outlines how regional collaboration could flip the script. If Latin American countries unify their decarbonization strategies, they can pool production capacities, create economies of scale, and channel SAF to areas with limited output at lower costs.

This approach is more than theoretical. Brazil, with its biofuel leadership, could supply SAF at competitive prices. Meanwhile, Colombia and Ecuador, which have lower production capacity, could tap into that network. In turn, producer countries gain market scale, while others maintain their flight schedules—and their economies.

Aviation Is More Than Travel—It’s Regional Lifeblood

In Latin America, aviation is not a luxury—it’s a necessity. The lack of reliable road or rail links means planes are often the only way to move people, goods, and ideas. Tourism, business, medical access, family connections—all depend on air travel.

“Without a roadmap, we risk increasing costs and compromising development,” says Juan José Tohá, Director of Corporate Affairs and Sustainability at LATAM Airlines Group. “Regional integration is essential.”

His counterpart at Airbus, Guillaume Gressin, doubles down: “This study confirms Latin America’s SAF potential—but also the need for unity. Joint action is the only path to affordable decarbonization.”

Tourism’s Tipping Point: Will SAF Choke Travel Demand?

The tourism industry in Latin America—worth billions in annual GDP—is watching this space closely. With inbound travel bouncing back post-pandemic and regional getaways on the rise, higher airfares could kill momentum.

Consider this: a 15-25% SAF fuel premium, passed on to ticket prices, could price out budget travelers and shrink the market for short-haul routes—just as domestic and regional tourism shows signs of full recovery.

Hotel occupancy rates in cities like Lima, Bogotá, and Santiago are climbing. New resort developments along the Mexican and Ecuadorian coasts are betting on airlift expansion. If SAF costs aren’t controlled, those bets could go bust.

Public Policy: The Missing Link

Despite its promise, SAF remains in its infancy in Latin America. Infrastructure is limited. Certification pathways are slow. Investment remains sparse. This is where governments must step in.

The study recommends:

Incentives for SAF production and distribution

Cross-border agreements to enable fuel sharing

Tax relief for airlines adopting SAF

Joint research and development programs

Without these interventions, private-sector investment will stall. Airlines will hesitate. And passengers will pay the price.

The Bigger Picture: Net-Zero Is Not Optional

Globally, aviation accounts for 2-3% of carbon emissions—but in a region like Latin America, where so many depend on air travel, decarbonization is both an environmental and economic necessity.

If Latin America embraces SAF, it could become a global leader in green aviation. The region boasts vast agricultural potential for biofuel feedstocks, strong solar potential for power-to-liquid processes, and growing demand for sustainable travel options.

But time is short.

“Momentum is building,” the report urges. “But if policymakers don’t act fast, the region will miss its window—and face the fallout.”

Looking Ahead: What’s at Stake

This isn’t just about clean fuel. It’s about preserving connectivity, growing tourism, and ensuring climate responsibility don’t derail regional development. SAF is the most viable path to net-zero. But it can’t succeed in isolation.

The call is clear: Unite, collaborate, legislate—or risk losing the skies.

Though the new administration has said very little if anything about where it stands on SAF, on the surface it makes sense for Trump to get fully behind such an industry if for nothing else to help secure future economic prosperity for farmers.

Trump has on more than one occasion said, ""we love our farmers,"" yet a potential goldmine for rural America sits stuck in neutral.

To this point the administration seems disinterested.

SAF will grow into a commercially viable venture for farmers and communities that are deeply invested in ethanol production, if it has the full support of the Trump administration.

Trump says a lot about creating new jobs and it's difficult to imagine any other regions of the country in more need of economic development and growth than rural areas.

No matter where you stand on the issue, it's clear right now that SAF doesn't have the momentum farmers and ethanol producers had hoped for here in May 2025.

Trump hasn't shied away from letting the world know what he thinks about the Inflation Reduction Act signed into law by the Biden administration. The IRA created the 45Z Clean Fuels Production tax credit.

Like it or not, 45Z is viewed by the administration as being part of the so-called green new deal.

That's at the root of why SAF has gone largely unrecognized by the new administration despite the industry's potential for rural Americans.

Trump has referred to the IRA as the ""green new scam"" and has dismissed clean energy incentives in the law as wasteful and ineffective. In February 2025 Trump called the IRA ""the greatest scam in the history of the country.""

STILL A 45Z EXPANSION COULD HAPPEN

Even with the Trump rhetoric, it doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility the administration could and probably should at some point change its view.

The rural vision of SAF's potential is shared by millions of farmers who voted for the president.

Perhaps at some point the Trump administration will get behind a long-term extension of 45Z that is set to expire on Dec. 31, 2027, even if it came from the previous administration.

As I wrote about a little over a year ago, ""The promise of SAF in rural America is unmistakable: Meeting a goal of producing 35 billion gallons by 2050 would demand a new feedstock market of billions of bushels of corn from Midwest farmers,"" https://www.dtnpf.com/….

Right now, farmers need markets more than anything.

Even if the current administration put its full weight of support behind SAF, it seems the future faces significant headwinds.

The easiest path for ethanol plants to be a big part of SAF is to reduce carbon scores through carbon capture and storage, so as to make the fuel more attractive to airlines that are pushing toward net-zero carbon emissions.

This is where carbon pipelines can play a significant role and it is at this intersection where SAF is seeing and will continue to see the most resistance.

SUMMIT STRUGGLES

Enter Summit Carbon Solutions -- a company with plans to connect 57 Midwest ethanol plants to a carbon pipeline to open the door to SAF production across farm country.

Prior to the end of 2024, Summit seemed to be making progress in obtaining permits and in clearing other regulatory hurdles in Iowa, North Dakota and Minnesota.

Since then, state lawmakers in Iowa and South Dakota have started to chip away at the chances that the proposed 2,500-mile pipeline will ever being built, read about that here: https://www.mprnews.org/….

Serious opposition to the use of eminent domain could derail the Summit project and right now it's taking center stage in Iowa and South Dakota.

South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden signed a bill into law in March that essentially bans eminent domain to acquire private property to build carbon pipelines.

Two weeks ago, the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission denied Summit's permit application for a second time.

That action has led Summit to explore the possibility of reducing the number of ethanol plants connecting and in changing the pipeline route.

In Iowa, state lawmakers are debating the future of eminent domain laws in response to the pipeline project.

Despite the negative publicity aimed at Summit, the vast majority of land acquired for the project does not come from eminent domain, according to company officials, https://apnews.com/….

WILL 45Z BE EXTENDED?

In Washington, D.C., the question remains wide open: Will federal lawmakers pass a new budget bill that includes room for a 45Z extension?

To invest billions of dollars in SAF infrastructure, biofuels industry representatives say 45Z needs to be in effect for many years.

In April, legislation was reintroduced in the U.S. Senate to extend the 45Z tax credit through Dec. 31, 2034. Last October, legislation was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives to extend 45Z through 2037.

In January, Trump placed a 90-day hold on tax credits including 45Z. Although the Internal Revenue Service has put out guidance on 45Z, Trump's recently proposed budget appears to contain no 45Z extension.

It doesn't appear 45Z is even on Trump's radar.

Despite all the blowback, Summit CEO Lee Blank said in a March 14 statement that his company expects to complete the pipeline.

""In South Dakota, recent legislative changes have temporarily slowed our timeline but they have not altered our vision or our determination,"" the statement reads.

""We remain confident that our project is moving forward in a way that benefits farmers, ethanol producers and rural communities. To the farmers, ethanol producers and industry leaders who stand with us: your commitment to innovation and progress is what drives this industry forward. We share your vision for a thriving agricultural economy, and we will continue working alongside you to make that vision a reality.""

So how bad to you want SAF, rural America?

If a long-term 45Z extension and the SAF industry are going to happen, farmers will have to openly push for both.

Trump may ultimately say no to the refined fuels industry on this one, unless someone makes a good economic case.

The plant will be built within the Zona Franca, the Free Trade Zone’s fiscal area, marking a significant step toward the city’s commitment to innovation and sustainable industrial development.

The facility will specialize in producing second-generation biodiesel, known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), intended primarily for the aviation sector. Plans include constructing raw material storage tanks with an initial capacity of 98,000 cubic meters, which may be expanded in the future. The expected output is 57,000 cubic meters of finished product annually, with a treatment capacity of 100,000 tons per year.

Strategically located near a dock, the site will facilitate the import of raw materials mainly from the Middle East, Europe and North Africa, with possible expansion into Asian markets. The feedstock will include non-edible fats, possibly of animal origin or used cooking oils, that comply with regulatory standards. According to company spokesperson Del Corral, the production process involves “fine chemicals” and purification steps to remove elements such as phospholipids.

Dreexo emphasizes the project's environmental sustainability. The company states that the process will generate minimal waste, with many byproducts repurposed. Rubber residues will be sold to other industries, sand used in filtration will be reused, and wastewater will be treated on-site to meet municipal standards. The solid-state raw materials also reduce the risk of spills, as the product is unloaded directly from ships without combustion or odor issues.

Construction is slated to begin in the first quarter of 2026 and is expected to create between 100 and 200 temporary jobs. The plant will be located on a 51,000-square-meter site formerly occupied by the Altadis tobacco factory. The construction will take place on the previously demolished palletizing area, where existing concrete slabs will undergo load testing. If the results are favorable, the site may not require ground reinforcement, potentially accelerating the project timeline.

Once operational, the plant will employ about 50 permanent workers, primarily engineers, technicians and vocationally trained personnel.

The Free Trade Zone highlights the project as part of its broader strategy to foster Industry 4.0 and support environmentally responsible businesses. While not categorized under the blue economy, the initiative fits within the circular economy framework. Dreexo joins a growing roster of companies in the area, including Elecam, Rospa, Quest Global and Capgemini. The lease agreement for the facility will span 20 years.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-05 13:56:32.575099

Until now, the precise properties of fuel at individual aircraft level have largely remained unknown due to complex airport fuel distribution and a lack of monitoring. Even within existing specification limits, variations in fuel composition — and resulting fuel properties — have been shown under laboratory and standardized engine test rig conditions to influence combustion processes and formation of pollutants. The FuelTrack campaign now extends this investigation into real-world daily operations at an airport environment.

“We are creating a unique scientific dataset,” says Dr. Benedict Enderle, Senior Scientist at DLR’s Institute of Combustion Technology. “By analyzing both fuel properties — like aromatics and sulphur content — and real-time aircraft emissions during taxi operations, we’re gaining unprecedented insight into how fuel properties influence combustion performance and emissions.

“Although we expect to see mostly conventional fuels during the measurement campaign, the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) is expected to increase due to regulatory requirements. With this shift, fuel composition variability is likely to grow-offering opportunities for targeted emissions reductions. To fully understand and leverage this potential, we need detailed data not only from laboratory experiments but also from real-world operational settings.

The ALIGHT project aims to close this knowledge gap, with findings that will inform both the aviation industry and research community.

“The majority of the fuel burned when aircraft are on the ground at CPH is the fuel the aircraft were refueled with at the departing airport,” adds Peter Wiboe Holm, Senior Sustainability Advisor.

“In relation to the local air quality in CPH, we are therefore very interested in understanding this natural variation in the fuel composition and using the results to strengthen our knowledge in the field and thereby support our existing air quality program. Understanding how different fuel blends, including sustainable aviation fuels, impact local air quality is essential for developing cleaner fuels and reducing aviation’s environmental footprint.”

Breakthrough in Emissions Research

The FuelTrack campaign will collect and analyze:

Real-time emissions from aircraft during taxi operations

Detailed fuel samples from both aircraft and the fuel distribution system at the airport

Flight data across multiple aircraft types

Variations in fuel properties from different airports

Emissions data is collected using an array of measurement equipment strategically positioned on the apron-including a van-based, mobile high-fidelity measurement lab from DLR.

Direct Correlation and Scientific Impact

For the first time, FuelTrack will enable direct correlation between the fuel supplied to aircraft and their resulting emissions under fully operational conditions at an airport. This unprecedented dataset will support:

Optimization of future jet fuel compositions

Evaluation of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blends

Air quality improvements at airports

Development of targeted emission reduction strategies

Scope:

The study will collect data over a time period of two weeks, establishing a baseline for current fuel variations, mapping emissions across aircraft types, and providing critical evidence for future fuel development and sustainable aviation policy. The results of the measurement campaign are expected to be ready during the autumn.

A key mission of the Green Fuel Forward initiative is to scale up production of SAF, which the industry regards as a vital tool to cut the sector’s growing greenhouse gas emissions. Governments globally, including Singapore’s, have set mandates that map steady increases in the percentage of SAF in planes’ fuel tanks in the coming years.

“The only way to get to net zero, or very close to net zero by the middle of the century, is very, very large amounts of SAF,” said Mr Robert Boyd, Boeing’s sustainability lead for the Asia-Pacific.

More efficient aircraft designs and engines can get perhaps 20 per cent of the way, and operations – such as better route planning – another 10 per cent, he told The Straits Times at the launch of the initiative during the GenZero Climate Summit 2025 at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre. The summit aims to showcase ways to hasten the decarbonisation of the global economy.

Boeing has been actively promoting the use of SAF and the company aims to ensure its commercial aircraft are certified to operate on 100 per cent SAF by 2030, he said.

Lack of awareness and higher costs for the greener fuel remain issues for SAF, which is two or three times as expensive as fossil fuel-derived aviation fuel. And in Asia, the world’s largest aviation market, demand is not keeping pace with planned production capacity additions in the coming years.

“The Asia-Pacific region has a unique opportunity to lead in sustainable aviation fuels, but unlocking this potential requires stronger demand signals,” said Mr Frederick Teo, chief executive of GenZero, an investment platform owned by Temasek.

SAF is designed to be a drop-in fuel for planes, needing no new additional infrastructure at airports. Current rules allow up to 50 per cent of SAF to be blended with fossil fuel-based jet fuel.

SAF can reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by up to 80 per cent compared with conventional jet fuel, according to the United Nations’ International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which has set a long-term aspirational goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions for international aviation by 2050.

The fuel is made mostly from waste materials such as used cooking oil and animal fat, but can also be made from agricultural residues and even alcohol.

The International Air Transport Association (Iata) estimates that SAF will achieve about 65 per cent of the emissions reductions needed for the industry to reach net zero by 2050. And cutting emissions has become increasingly critical, with aviation currently accounting for approximately 2.5 per cent of global CO2 emissions, and possibly doubling or even tripling from 2019 levels by 2050 unless concerted action is taken.

Green Fuel Forward is a capacity-building initiative that aims to draw in airlines, refiners, logistics firms, banks and others. A total of 16 companies and organisations have agreed to participate, including Boeing, Climate Impact X, DBS Bank, DHL, the International Energy Agency, Neste, Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Temasek and UOB.

Singapore Airlines first started using SAF in 2017 on a trial basis and is hoping for greater market participation to drive up demand and push down prices, said chief sustainability officer Lee Wen Fen. The airline regards SAF as key to its decarbonisation goals.

A key focus of the initiative is to boost the take-up of SAF certificates by companies to offset their own emissions or the travel emissions of their employees, for example.

The certificates can be bought on exchanges, such as Singapore’s Climate Impact X, and each is linked to the creation of one tonne of SAF. Certificate buyers can track and claim the environmental benefits, such as emissions reductions, of using SAF without having to purchase the physical fuel.

The emissions reduction can be claimed once the tonne of SAF is burned, with the accounting process approved by ICAO. On average, each SAF credit represents a CO2 emissions reduction of 2.5 tonnes to 2.8 tonnes versus conventional fuel.

The initiative will organise workshops and practical guidance tools to help organisations navigate topics such as environmental integrity and reporting practices for SAF and SAF certificates.

Globally, SAF still comprises a fraction of total jet fuel use. And in the Asia-Pacific, uptake is far slower than in Europe.

In 2024, Iata said SAF production reached one million tonnes (1.3 billion litres) – or about 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production. This is double 2023’s production of 0.5 million tonnes but far below the initial projections for 2024 of 1.5 million tonnes.

Rules mandating SAF usage will drive up demand over time.

Flights departing EU airports must now use 2 per cent SAF in their fuel mix, rising to 6 per cent in 2030 and 70 per cent by 2050. For Japan, SAF must account for at least 10 per cent of domestic airlines’ jet fuel consumption by 2030.

In Singapore, 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports must be sustainable, with a goal to reach 3 per cent to 5 per cent by 2030.

Singapore Airlines and its budget arm Scoot are among those committed to reaching a goal of 5 per cent sustainable aviation fuel use by 2030.

There are other challenges for the industry, including ensuring the environmental integrity of feedstocks, such as land-based feedstock, which can lead to unintended consequences for deforestation, said Temasek’s managing director for sustainability, Ms Park Kyung-ah, during a panel discussion at the launch.

In Europe and the US, governments have also expressed concerns about reports of virgin palm oil being fraudulently added to boost used cooking oil supplies to SAF refineries. The EU forbids the use of virgin palm oil as an SAF feedstock.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1811fa75f7a30753cfbcf43d7f08ea752017cb444e838fda00e1d3d9ed9152fd,N,,2025-05-05 10:56:11.511329

Studies have found that only a small number of flights are responsible for most of the contrail climate warming.","Air transportation’s non-CO2 emissions contribute to climate warming, with contrail-cirrus playing a major role. Reducing soot emissions via Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) or low-naphthalene low-sulfur jet fuel can mitigate contrail impacts. However, uncertainties remain, especially in low-soot conditions where other emissions may contribute more to ice crystal formation.

Strategic mitigation, such as using SAF on high-impact routes or optimizing Conventional Aviation Fuel (CAF) properties, could maximize benefits in the short term. Nonetheless, the economic and environmental trade-offs, as well as safety and infrastructural challenges, should be better assessed to determine feasible solutions. A collaborative, industry-wide approach is needed to balance environmental goals with economic and technological realities.

Executive summary

Air transport’s total environmental impact results from both its CO2 and non-CO2 emissions (e.g., NOx and contrails). Non-CO2 effects have a global warming impact that has been estimated to comprise approximately half of the industry’s total climate impact, albeit with a much wider range of uncertainty in the precise quantification compared to that of CO2. Non-CO2 effects are also short-lived (i.e., hours to decades) compared to CO2 emissions which accumulate in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.

SAF is one of the main decarbonization levers for the air transport industry. According to IATA’s Net Zero Roadmap, almost two-thirds of the industry’s sector-wide CO2 emission abatement will be achieved by using SAF. While technologies for producing SAF are well understood, and the HEFA pathway in particular is commercially mature, supply is likely to be limited in the near future. However, increased SAF production and adoption would not only cut CO2 net emissions, but the use of SAF can also bring non-CO2 climate and air quality co-benefits by reducing particle emissions. While the air transport industry’s priority should remain the reduction in CO2 emissions because of their long-term cumulative warming effect, and because the science is more certain in this domain, the industry should also capitalize on the non-CO2 co-benefits of SAF to achieve and maximize its environmental benefits and reduce the industry’s environmental impact further. This approach would minimize the total environmental near-term impact while allowing time for fully sustainable solutions to develop, which can address non-CO2 climate drivers such as contrails.

Numerous measurement studies have shown that jet engines burning SAF or fuels with lower aromatic and sulfur content modify aircraft engine emissions compared to conventional fossil-based jet fuel (CAF). Specifically, emissions of black carbon, or “soot”, and smaller particles such as those derived from sulfur dioxide are curtailed. Based on these studies, it is widely accepted that SAF and other fuels with these properties exhibit lower soot emissions in comparison with CAF and that a large fraction of the soot emissions is from naphthalene compounds.

Contrail cirrus clouds have a significant warming effect on the climate. Most of today’s jet engines emit large amounts of soot particles, which contribute to the formation of the ice crystals that make up contrails and impact the climate. In this high-soot regime, measurement and modeling studies have shown that reducing soot emissions by using SAF with lower naphthalenes and sulfur content can have a positive contrail climate benefit.

Modern jet engines with newer technologies (e.g., TAPS combustors), or older engines burning fuel with near-zero levels of naphthalenes or sulfur, emit considerably fewer soot particles. However, the smaller particles emitted from the engine or entrained from the ambient atmosphere in this low-soot regime can also contribute to the formation of ice crystals. Ambient conditions, such as temperature and humidity, can potentially increase the radiative and climate impact of the contrail. While more measurements and research are needed to better understand the role of these smaller particles in contrail formation, recent studies indicate the importance of reducing both soot and smaller particles from engine emissions to achieve climate and air quality benefits.

The climate impact of contrails is short-lived and dependent on the geographical location, altitude, and time of day and year in which they form and persist. Studies have found that only a small number of flights are responsible for most of the contrail climate warming. Given that scaling up SAF production is slow and that supplies are limited, prioritizing SAF use on specific routes that are more prone to forming highly warming contrails could be an efficient strategy to optimize the climate co-benefits of SAF in the shorter term. However, there are significant and costly logistical and infrastructural issues and challenges that need to be addressed in determining the feasibility of such strategies.

Altering fuel composition by removing or reducing naphthalenes and sulfur from CAF to reduce particle emissions is also being considered as a strategy to help reduce air transportation’s non-CO2 impacts. While current refining technologies to optimize fuel composition for environmental benefits exist, producers and suppliers have little incentive given the associated added costs. In addition, the extra processing required will lead to increases in the life cycle emissions, resulting in a climate penalty. Modifying fuel standards may be a way to mitigate non-CO2 effects, but in-depth comprehensive assessments of the associated safety, economic, technological, and environmental trade-offs are required to determine optimal and feasible solutions, including policy incentives, before any further decisions are made.

Mitigating non-CO2 effects is complicated by complex interdependencies and trade-offs, as well as scientific uncertainties associated with some of the related processes. An industry-wide approach built on multi-stakeholder and scientific collaboration is needed to find achievable smart solutions. These solutions should also consider environmental and technological changes over the next couple of decades. Changes in the background state of the atmosphere due to reductions in surface emissions from other sectors, as well as changes in the climate, will have an influence on the effects of non-CO2 emissions. Furthermore, with fleet turnover, low soot-producing engines (e.g., LEAP, GEnx, GE9X) will eventually replace the non-CO2 benefits of fuel with lower aromatic content.",https://iata.shorthandstories.com/the-non-co2-climate-co-benefit-of-saf-and-other-fuels-with-low-aromatic-and-sulphur-content/assets/9LwdxZlv8g/frame-at-0.000s-of-gettyimages-1223578062-1280x720-1500078-social-cover.jpg,N,,2025-05-05 13:56:43.430635

If you've been searching endlessly for answers, you're not alone. In a high-stakes sector where precision meets pressure, finding dependable <a href=""../""><strong>aviation fuel companies in India</strong></a> isn't just a procurement task&mdash;it&rsquo;s a strategic decision that could define your entire operational rhythm.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Let&rsquo;s face it. Delayed shipments, substandard fuel, unclear logistics&mdash;these aren&rsquo;t just occasional hiccups. They&rsquo;re costly disruptions. When you&rsquo;re responsible for fueling aircraft that carry lives, reputations, and business continuity, there&rsquo;s no room for error. That&rsquo;s exactly why understanding how to source bulk aviation fuel the right way&mdash;from trusted suppliers, with solid logistics and future-ready fuel options&mdash;has become mission-critical.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">This article brings you real-time insights, proven supplier strategies, and everything you need to make smarter aviation fuel decisions in India&rsquo;s ever-evolving energy landscape. Let&rsquo;s dive straight into it.</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">The Hidden Struggles Behind Bulk Aviation Fuel Procurement</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">Here&rsquo;s a staggering number: <strong>India&rsquo;s aviation market is expected to reach 520 million</strong> passengers by 2037, making it the third-largest globally. Yet despite this growth, bulk aviation fuel procurement still remains a daunting task for many operators&mdash;particularly regional airlines and private aviation firms.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Picture this: a mid-sized charter service operating out of Ahmedabad receives an urgent booking to fly a VIP client across borders. But just as the pilot begins pre-flight checks, operations flags an issue&mdash;fuel delivery delay. Again.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">This isn&rsquo;t fiction&mdash;it&rsquo;s a recurring crisis. Why? Because finding reliable <strong>aviation fuel suppliers in India</strong> who can guarantee consistency, compliance, and clarity in pricing is still an uphill battle.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">But here&rsquo;s where things begin to shift&mdash;India&rsquo;s supplier landscape is maturing, and new-age companies are stepping in with global-grade solutions.</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">India&rsquo;s Aviation Fuel Market: A Fast-Evolving Ecosystem</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">India consumes over 8 million metric tonnes of aviation turbine fuel (ATF) annually. The consumption has grown by 15% year-over-year, driven by increased air traffic and cargo aviation expansion.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">From public sector giants to dynamic private players, a network of <a href=""../""><strong>aviation fuel companies in India</strong></a> now offers high-purity Jet A1 fuel, EN590, and sustainable alternatives. These firms operate across major hubs like Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Chennai, serving everything from commercial airliners to defense, cargo, and private jets.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">What&rsquo;s changing? Logistics digitization. Faster documentation processing. GPS-tracked tankers. And most critically, transparent pricing models that remove the guesswork from procurement.</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">How to Identify Aviation Fuel Suppliers You Can Actually Trust</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">If you've ever worked with a vendor who missed a fuel delivery window, you know it's not just frustrating&mdash;it's financially and operationally crippling. That's why the most successful aviation buyers follow a few golden rules:</p> <p dir=""ltr"">They evaluate <strong>compliance protocols</strong>&mdash;like adherence to ASTM D1655 and DEF STAN 91-091.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">They demand fuel integrity certificates and real-time traceability on fuel lots.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">They prioritize partners offering <strong>24/7 emergency support</strong>, trained technical personnel on-ground, and scalable logistics tailored to airside operations.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">And most importantly, they ask questions not just about fuel quality&mdash;but about <strong>operational resilience and response time</strong> during unplanned disruptions.</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">Why India&rsquo;s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Boom Can&rsquo;t Be Ignored</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">Globally, aviation contributes 2.5% of CO₂ emissions. But here&rsquo;s the kicker&mdash;<strong>sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)</strong> can cut those emissions by up to 80% over the lifecycle. India, with its vast agricultural base and emerging waste-processing technologies, is uniquely positioned to lead the SAF revolution in South Asia.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">In fact, in 2024, India&rsquo;s SAF production capacity crossed 150,000 tonnes per annum, with plans underway to triple this figure by 2027. <a href=""../""><strong>Sustainable aviation fuel companies in India</strong></a> are now actively partnering with airlines and corporate fleets for long-term supply contracts.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">These alternative fuel types are no longer futuristic&mdash;they're being blended at major airports and used by progressive aviation clients who want to future-proof their carbon strategy.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">And if your brand wants to remain relevant in a net-zero aviation future, it's time to take that leap.</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">CASE STUDY: Transforming Fuel Supply for a Regional Carrier</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">In mid-2024, a regional airline operating out of Kochi faced increasing delays due to inconsistent fuel supply. A switch to a <strong>blended supplier</strong>&mdash;offering both Jet A1 and <strong>sustainable aviation fuel</strong> with AI-enabled logistics&mdash;changed the game.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Here&rsquo;s what happened:</p> <ul> <li dir=""ltr"" aria-level=""1""> <p dir=""ltr"" role=""presentation"">97% reduction in flight delays due to pre-scheduled fuel slots.</p> </li> <li dir=""ltr"" aria-level=""1""> <p dir=""ltr"" role=""presentation"">18% cost efficiency achieved by reducing dead-mile logistics.</p> </li> <li dir=""ltr"" aria-level=""1""> <p dir=""ltr"" role=""presentation"">Significant ESG recognition for adopting alternative fuel resources.</p> </li> <li dir=""ltr"" aria-level=""1""> <p dir=""ltr"" role=""presentation"">Fuel dispatch time dropped from 4 hours to just 55 minutes.</p> </li> </ul> <p dir=""ltr"">That transformation didn&rsquo;t come from just changing vendors&mdash;it came from rethinking the role of fuel in their operations.</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">Recent News &amp; Trends That Matter Right Now</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">In Q1 2025, the Indian government announced a national blending mandate&mdash;requiring 1% of all ATF at major airports to be SAF by 2026, rising to <strong>5% by 2030</strong>.<br>Simultaneously, investments in green refining infrastructure are projected to exceed <strong>₹10,000 crore</strong> in the next 3 years.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Multiple aviation fuel companies are now expanding logistics infrastructure near regional airports to support the <strong>UDAN scheme</strong>, making air connectivity economically viable in remote regions.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">This isn&rsquo;t just news&mdash;it&rsquo;s opportunity. Aligning with suppliers who are compliant and proactive today will protect your business tomorrow.</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">Conclusion: Fuel Smarter, Fly Farther&mdash;with a Partner Who Understands Both</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">Fuel procurement is more than just a transaction&mdash;it&rsquo;s a mission-critical decision with far-reaching consequences. The wrong supplier can cost you thousands per hour in delays, lost clients, and compliance fines. The right one? They don&rsquo;t just refuel your fleet&mdash;they <strong>empower your strategy</strong>.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Whether you're scaling routes, digitizing your logistics, or transitioning toward cleaner energy, it all begins with choosing <a href=""../""><strong>aviation fuel companies in India</strong></a> who are aligned with your standards&mdash;and your vision.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">And if you're looking for a<strong> single-window solution that connects you to verified</strong>, <strong>trusted aviation fuel suppliers</strong>, accelerates global procurement, ensures quality transparency, and simplifies the compliance maze&mdash;Exporters Worlds is your gateway.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">With its curated network, advanced logistics partnerships, and seamless onboarding system, Exporters Worlds ensures you fuel smarter, faster, and with confidence. In an industry where every second and every drop counts&mdash;this is the edge you&rsquo;ve been waiting for.</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">FAQs: Key Questions Aviation Buyers Are Asking</h2> <p dir=""ltr""><strong>1. Which company offers the best aviation fuel in India?</strong><br>The best company varies by need. While state-run oil firms have scale, agile private players now offer superior turnaround times, flexible logistics, and real-time tech interfaces.</p> <p dir=""ltr""><strong>2.

<p dir=""ltr"">Let&rsquo;s face it&mdash;oil and gas are the driving forces behind the global economy, and the industry is changing fast. So, who&rsquo;s leading this shift? India is making its mark. With industry giants like Reliance Industries, Indian Oil Corporation, and ONGC, India isn&rsquo;t just part of the energy market anymore; it&rsquo;s shaping its future.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">The o<strong>il and gas industry in India</strong> is evolving quickly, setting new benchmarks for sustainability, innovation, and growth. Home to some of the <a href=""../""><strong>largest oil and gas companies</strong></a>, India is at the forefront of a new era of energy, driving progress toward a diverse, efficient, and sustainable future. As these giants grow, India&rsquo;s influence on global energy production and consumption is undeniable.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Let&rsquo;s dive deeper into how India&rsquo;s oil and gas industry is transforming the global energy landscape.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">&nbsp;</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">2. From Energy Dependent to Energy Defining: India's Bold Shift</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">India's journey from a major consumer of oil to a global player in its own right is fascinating. For decades, India relied on imports to fuel its massive demand. However, <strong>strategic investments in refining</strong>, <strong>exploration</strong>, and logistics have now positioned India not only as a consumer but as a producer, refiner, and influencer in the global oil ecosystem.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Indian oil and gas companies like Reliance Industries, ONGC, and <strong>Indian Oil Corporation (IOC)</strong> have become household names, not just in India, but globally. In fact, Reliance alone accounts for about 20% of India's total oil refining capacity. These companies are leading the charge in refining, energy innovation, and resource development. Through collaborations with key international players and strong geopolitical ties, India is ensuring that its voice is heard in critical oil discussions worldwide.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">India's ability to move beyond just demand and position itself as a supply chain innovator has revolutionized its status in the global <strong>oil and gas industry</strong>.</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">3. Crude Control: India's Strategic Leverage in Global Oil Products</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">India&rsquo;s role as a global refining powerhouse cannot be overstated. The country is the <strong>world's third-largest refiner</strong>, processing more crude than it consumes. In 2021, India processed 4.85 million bpd of crude oil, which is only behind the US and China. But it doesn&rsquo;t stop there&mdash;India's refineries churn out surplus refined products that are exported across the globe. From <strong>jet fuel and diesel</strong> to LPG and naphtha, India plays a pivotal role in the energy market, especially in Asia, where it caters to energy-hungry nations.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">This refining dominance is more than just an economic advantage. It positions India as a strategic player with the ability to control and influence the flow of energy resources, ensuring its central role in the global oil trade. This ability also places India among the <a href=""../""><strong>top 5 oil and gas companies in India</strong></a> based on refining capacity.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">&nbsp;</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">4. Refining Power + Digital Intelligence = India&rsquo;s Competitive Advantage</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">What sets India apart in the oil and gas industry isn't just its refining capacity but also its technological ingenuity. In places like Gujarat, India houses the <strong>largest refinery complex in the world</strong>: Jamnagar Refinery, which has a capacity of 1.24 million bpd. This refinery isn't just a technological marvel in terms of size; it&rsquo;s a model of digital integration.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">AI-driven systems, predictive analytics, and automated logistics ensure that Indian refineries run smoothly, minimizing risks, optimizing production, and ensuring fuel distribution is always on target. In 2023, Reliance Industries achieved a 10% reduction in operational costs through the use of digital technologies across its refineries. The synergy of traditional refining power combined with <strong>modern digital technologies</strong> gives India a competitive edge that the rest of the world is beginning to envy.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">&nbsp;</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">5. Energy Diplomacy: When India Speaks, OPEC Listens</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">India&rsquo;s influence extends far beyond its borders, especially when it comes to energy diplomacy. For decades, OPEC countries held the cards, controlling the supply and <strong>pricing of crude oil</strong>. But India, with its large and growing demand, is now a force to reckon with in energy discussions. In 2020, India accounted for nearly 11% of global oil consumption, making it a critical market that OPEC countries can no longer ignore.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">India&rsquo;s partnerships with countries like Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United States have allowed it to diversify its oil imports. In 2022, India became the <strong>third-largest importer of crude oil from</strong> the US, a testament to its expanding diplomatic reach. Simultaneously, the country&rsquo;s active participation in energy forums such as the <strong>International Energy Forum (IEF)</strong> has placed it at the negotiation table, ensuring that it is no longer just at the mercy of others' decisions.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">With its strategic energy policies and growing market clout, India is in a unique position to influence <a href=""../""><strong>global oil pricing</strong></a> and trade policies.</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">6. The Green Transition: Leading the Dual Energy Game</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">India&rsquo;s ambitions aren&rsquo;t just limited to traditional oil and gas; the country is also pioneering the <strong>green energy transition</strong>. While committing to net <strong>zero emissions</strong> by 2070, India is continuing to develop its fossil fuel resources responsibly.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">What&rsquo;s more impressive is how India is integrating <strong>sustainable energy solutions</strong> into its oil and gas infrastructure. The country is leading the charge in biofuels, green diesel, and renewable energy technologies, proving that you don&rsquo;t have to abandon oil to build a clean energy future. India&rsquo;s green hydrogen market is projected to reach <strong>$8 billion</strong> by 2030, signaling its commitment to building a dual energy framework.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">India's vision isn&rsquo;t about choosing one over the other; it&rsquo;s about creating a dual energy model that innovates and evolves with time.</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">7. Case Study: How Reliance Is Becoming the Saudi Aramco of Asia</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">India&rsquo;s Reliance Industries is a prime example of how Indian companies are changing the global energy game. With its state-of-the-art refining infrastructure and diverse investments in renewable energy, hydrogen, and <strong>green technologies</strong>, Reliance is quickly becoming a global energy titan.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Reliance&rsquo;s massive refinery at Jamnagar is the largest in the world, and its ability to adapt to changing energy demands makes it a key player on the world stage. As Reliance pushes forward into <strong>green fuel technologies</strong>, it&rsquo;s positioning itself to challenge the dominance of companies like Saudi Aramco, especially in Asia.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Reliance&rsquo;s annual revenue for 2023 was <strong>$100 billion</strong>, with more than 20% of this coming from its oil refining and petrochemical sectors. As it accelerates its green initiatives, Reliance is on track to become a dominant force in both traditional and clean energy markets.</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">8.

Conclusion: India Isn&rsquo;t Watching the Future of Oil&mdash;It&rsquo;s Building It</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">The days when India was just a passive consumer of energy are over. The country is actively reshaping the future of the global <strong>oil and gas industry</strong> through its technological prowess, energy diplomacy, and green energy initiatives. From refining to trade, from oil diplomacy to the green transition, India is setting the stage for a new energy order.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">If you&rsquo;re in the oil and gas industry, whether you&rsquo;re an investor, a producer, or an energy tech company, one thing is clear: India&rsquo;s impact on the future of oil and gas is undeniable. And those who aren&rsquo;t aligned with this shift risk being left behind.</p> <p dir=""ltr""><strong>Exporters Worlds</strong>, as a <strong>global B2B platform</strong>, is perfectly positioned to connect <a href=""../""><strong>oil and gas companies</strong></a> worldwide with opportunities to tap into the vast and dynamic market India offers. With its unmatched refining capacity, powerful industry players, and expanding energy initiatives, India is no longer just shaping the future of the oil and gas industry&mdash;it is defining it.</p> <h2 dir=""ltr"">The Questions That Matter Most(FAQs)</h2> <p dir=""ltr"">Question No. 1: Which is the largest oil and gas company in India?<br>Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) stands as India&rsquo;s largest oil and gas company. It holds a dominant position in refining, marketing, and distribution, with one of the highest revenues among the <strong>oil giants</strong>. In 2023, IOC's revenue was $68 billion, making it a leading player in the <strong>global oil and gas industry</strong>.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Question No. 2: How do I start in the oil and gas industry?<br>Starting in the oil and gas industry involves understanding its diverse segments: upstream (exploration and drilling), midstream (transportation and storage), and downstream (refining and distribution). The key is to gain industry-specific knowledge, whether through technical degrees, joining established firms, or exploring new niches like <strong>energy tech</strong> and clean fuels.</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Question No. 3:&nbsp; What are the key challenges faced by oil and gas companies in India?</p> <p><strong>Oil and gas companies in India</strong> face challenges like <strong>crude oil price volatility</strong>, with India importing 85% of its oil. Regulatory changes and increasing environmental concerns further complicate operations. Additionally, the shift to renewable energy forces companies to innovate and adopt sustainable practices. Platforms like <strong>Exporters Worlds</strong> can offer valuable partnerships and solutions to navigate these complexities effectively.</p>",,N,,2025-05-05 16:56:33.662409

Reflecting on the collaborative efforts at the Muara Labuh PLTP, Minister Airlangga noted the continued growth of trade and investment relations between the two nations.

""In 2024, the value of Indonesia-Japan trade reached US$35 billion, and Japanese investment increased by 52 percent from 2021 to US$3.5 billion,"" Airlangga stated in a written press release on Monday, May 5, 2025.

Airlangga highlighted that Japan is currently Indonesia's sixth-largest investor, with over 12,000 strategic projects. He also expressed appreciation for Japan's support in the advancement of green energy and technological innovation.

""We deeply appreciate Japan's commitment and leadership in fostering sustainable development. This reflects the shared aspiration of both countries to cultivate mutually beneficial economic cooperation,"" he affirmed.

During the meeting, Airlangga emphasized Indonesia's pivotal role as Japan's primary partner within AZEC. He noted that 175 Memoranda of Understanding have already been signed by business entities from both countries.

Furthermore, he stated the government's commitment to accelerating the realization of these low-emission projects by addressing various challenges through cross-sector collaboration and public-private partnerships. The Golkar Party politician added that the government is also actively promoting the advancement of other AZEC projects, including the Legok Nangka waste-to-energy plant, the development of sustainable aviation fuel, the Sarulla geothermal power plant, and the Java-Sumatra transmission network.

""These projects show the seriousness of Indonesia and Japan in expediting the transition to clean energy and green economic development. The visit of former Prime Minister Kishida reinforces our commitment to continued collaboration for a low-carbon future,"" he asserted.

The meeting also included a signing ceremony for a cooperation agreement between PT Supreme Energy Muara Labuh and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). Airlangga explained that this agreement marks a significant step in the development of the Muara Labuh geothermal power plant project, which is targeted for commercial operation in the first quarter of 2027.

1 BCG sustainable aviation needs a faster takeoff - March 27, 2025 2 EASA – State of the EU SAF Market 2023","Brussels, 05 May 2025: We reject claims from the aviation sector suggesting a lack of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) supply. Our members are on track to meet their current mandate and exceed 2030 targets. Despite policy and investment challenges, European fuel producers have rapidly scaled SAF output and lowered costs. We urge regulatory clarity, feedstock support, and fair recognition of ongoing efforts, and underline our commitment to decarbonising aviation and achieving EU climate goals.

With surprise and concern, FuelsEurope and its members are following the public debate that recently emerged around the availability of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) in the EU and the role of the European fuel manufacturing industry.

Recent statements from the aviation sector claim that fuel producers are failing to deliver the required quantities of SAF to the market, based on a first version of a 2025 Boston Consulting Group (BCG) report. The very same report, however, omits any reference to the European fuel and refining industry, which is already supplying SAF to the EU market and supporting the achievement of the European targets set by the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative. Following the public use of this study by the aviation sectors and the possible misinterpretation of its conclusions, it is to be noted that BCG has clarified that global “supplies of bio-SAF are projected to reach 9 to 12 million tons by 2030 and exceed the regulatory-driven demand (including ReFuelEU mandates of about 3 million tons in 2030)”1.

The current capacity of HEFA (today the most common bio-SAF) operated by FuelsEurope’s members in the EU is about 1.5 million tonnes per year. An additional 2,4 million tonnes per year additional firm SAF capacity set to come in operation up to 2029. In comparison, the SAF needed to cover the 2% ReFuel EU mandate in 2025 is 1 mln tn/yr (already produced). The SAF needed to cover 6% mandate in 2030 is 2,7 mln tn/yr, and is expected to be met.

The European Union’s own Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)2 comes to similar conclusions: SAF supply is expected to exceed 3.2 million tonnes annually by 2030, supported by a growing number of projects across the EU.

Moreover, according to Argus Media, the EU SAF capacity is expected to exceed demand until at least 2035:

Argus Media - Spotlight on European SAF Market - Countdown to 2025

This trajectory signals clear progress toward decarbonising the aviation sector. Despite operating in an unstable environment, with a fragmented legislative framework that does not offer a clear business case for the billion-euro investments required to transform refineries into renewable fuel production hubs, our members continue to invest—assuming significant risk—in a market with high production costs that lacks the needed support.

Currently, seven biorefineries (with another one under transformation), are already producing 100% renewable fuels for all transport modes, for a total volume of about 4 million tonnes per year supplied to the EU market. At the same time, other refineries are moving towards co-processing fuels from a mix of fossil and sustainable feedstocks. SAF is a high-priority in these conversions that are all dedicated to meeting the goals of the Fit-for-55 package.

These pioneering and innovative actions by the European refining sector have led to:

● A significant ten-times increase in SAF production within just two years (from 100Kt in 2022 to 1Mt in 2024);

● A significant and consistent decline of average SAF prices, with the premium falling from a ratio of over 4 to below 2 compared to conventional jet fuel levels within just three years3.

We share concerns over the affordability of SAF, so policy needs to enable the mobilisation of more feedstocks for SAF and provide targeted support for highly capital-intensive e-SAF projects in the forthcoming Sustainable Transport Investment Plan.

An adequate legislative framework and a clear business case for the transformation of our sector would give a great boost to these first steps and would accelerate the decarbonisation of all sectors that rely on - or may benefit from - the transition of our industry.

In particular, for the aviation sector, the following regulatory actions should be taken for an accelerated SAF uptake:

● Enable predictable growth: allow annual national SAF incentives to anticipate ReFuelEU targets, and define post-2030 annual mandates in the 2027 ReFuelEU revision.

● Provide feedstock certainty: clarify rules for new feedstocks like intermediate and degraded land crops, and avoid overregulation that discourages their adoption.

● Recognise co-processed RFNBO hydrogen contributions in final products: RED and ReFuelEU Aviation must acknowledge a RFNBO share when it is chemically bound or enhances the heating value of the SAF.

● Improve SAF regulatory conditions: advance clear rules for Low-Carbon Fuels and align circular carbon sourcing criteria across RED and ETS systems.

The aviation industry needs sustainable fuels. Europe’s fuel manufacturers are already delivering and are ready to accelerate.

Our industry has always supported the EU's climate goals and actively contributes to their achievement, being one of the key sectors for the successful transition to climate neutrality. However, the challenges it faces concerning competitiveness and the investment environment within the EU require collaboration and alignment among all stakeholders, fostering open and unbiased discussions with policymakers, and leveraging all strategic industrial and production sectors of the EU.

We are here—ready to contribute to the major challenges and goals ahead. We call for recognition of our strategic role in shaping a future of sustainable transport—on land, in the air, and at sea.

Air New Zealand is redefining its approach to sustainability, announcing a shift from rigid emissions reduction targets to a more flexible, guidance-based framework aimed at achieving its environmental goals. The airline’s new strategy, known as the 2030 Emissions Guidance, is a direct response to the evolving challenges faced by the aviation sector, including technological limitations, supply chain hurdles, and the increasing complexities of decarbonizing air travel.

The shift reflects a growing recognition within the aviation industry that achieving net-zero emissions by a specific date is a highly ambitious and sometimes impractical goal, especially when confronted with factors like fuel supply constraints and the pace of technological advancements. With this in mind, Air New Zealand has decided to focus on a more achievable emissions reduction range, offering the company the flexibility to adapt as new innovations and solutions emerge.

A Pragmatic Approach to Emissions Reduction

Instead of setting an exact emissions target, Air New Zealand now aims to cut jet fuel-related emissions by 20-30% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels. This revised approach reflects a more pragmatic outlook on what is realistically achievable within the next decade, given the challenges the airline industry faces in scaling up cleaner technologies like Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

The decision to move away from hard emissions targets to a more flexible guidance framework is designed to ensure the airline remains on track with its sustainability goals while accommodating uncertainties in both technology development and regulatory requirements. By adopting this guidance-based approach, Air New Zealand can adjust its strategy as new solutions become available, while continuing to make meaningful progress toward reducing its carbon footprint.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Key to the Future of Aviation

One of the cornerstones of Air New Zealand’s emissions reduction plan is the increased use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF is produced from renewable feedstocks like agricultural waste, algae, and forest residues, offering a far lower carbon footprint than traditional jet fuel. As part of its long-term sustainability plan, Air New Zealand is targeting 10% SAF usage by 2030.

However, the global SAF market remains in its infancy, and scaling up its production presents significant challenges. SAF is currently more expensive to produce than conventional jet fuel, and supply is limited. To address these challenges, Air New Zealand has been working extensively to secure a stable and scalable SAF supply, including domestic sources from New Zealand’s forestry sector.

The airline’s dedication to SAF is underscored by its ongoing efforts to establish partnerships with fuel producers, suppliers, and other stakeholders to create a robust, sustainable supply chain. Air New Zealand is also exploring the use of waste products from the forestry industry, such as sawdust, to produce SAF, which would help reduce both aviation emissions and New Zealand’s overall carbon footprint.

Carbon Offsetting: Complementing SAF with Carbon Credit Purchases

While SAF is central to Air New Zealand’s decarbonization strategy, the airline recognizes that it will not be sufficient on its own to meet its emissions reduction goals. To help offset its remaining emissions, Air New Zealand will continue to purchase carbon credits through the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). This scheme, established by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), aims to offset carbon emissions from international flights, maintaining carbon-neutral growth beyond 2020.

In addition to participating in CORSIA, Air New Zealand plans to buy approximately 11,000 tonnes of carbon credits to further offset its emissions. These credits will support a variety of nature-based solutions, such as forest restoration and other carbon removal projects in New Zealand, contributing to the airline’s broader commitment to sustainable environmental practices.

A Fleet Upgrade to Support Sustainability Goals

In addition to SAF and carbon offsetting, Air New Zealand is investing in its fleet to ensure that its operations are as fuel-efficient as possible. The airline is upgrading its fleet with more modern, energy-efficient aircraft, which use less fuel and produce fewer emissions. This strategy includes the continued introduction of newer models, such as the Airbus A321neo and the Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner, both of which offer superior fuel efficiency compared to older aircraft.

As of May 2024, the airline’s fleet is comprised of a diverse range of aircraft, including narrowbody, widebody, and turboprop models, with a strong emphasis on fuel-efficient designs. Some of the key aircraft in Air New Zealand’s fleet include:

17 Airbus A320 aircraft, including both classic and newer models

12 Airbus A321neo aircraft, with plans to add more in the near future

30 ATR 72-600 turboprops, used for regional routes

10 Boeing 777-300ERs for long-haul international travel

14 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners for international flights

3 Boeing 787-10s, offering increased seating and improved fuel efficiency

23 Dash 8-Q300 turboprops for domestic and short-haul routes

In addition to investing in modern aircraft, Air New Zealand is also adopting advanced flight optimization systems to improve fuel efficiency during flight. These systems enable more precise routing and better management of flight speed and altitude, reducing overall fuel consumption.

Looking Ahead: Challenges and Commitments

Despite the progress made, Air New Zealand acknowledges that there is still much work to be done. The airline’s shift to a guidance-based emissions framework does not signal a retreat from its sustainability goals but rather a commitment to a more adaptive and transparent approach. The challenges of scaling SAF production, securing reliable supply chains, and implementing new technologies remain, but the airline is determined to continue its journey toward a more sustainable future.

The airline’s new emissions guidance approach represents a balance between ambition and realism, offering a roadmap that can evolve with the times while still driving meaningful progress toward the goal of reducing aviation’s environmental impact.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/freepik__the-style-is-candid-ima-2025-05-05T171536019.jpg,N,,2025-05-05 10:56:50.934649

According to the report, 77% of North American airlines ranked cybersecurity among their top three IT priorities for 2025, with nearly half (45%) citing it as their single top focus. AI also stands out, with nearly half (45%) naming it their number one priority, which is a level of commitment to AI innovation significantly higher than seen globally.

“The 2024 North American IT Insights report clearly shows that airlines are not just responding to current operational challenges but are actively investing in the technologies that will scale to support seamless air travel,” said Shawn Gregor, President of the Americas at SITA. “From cybersecurity defenses to AI-driven operational efficiencies, North American airlines are setting the pace for industry-wide transformation ahead of forecasted rapid growth in passenger volume.”

Key Highlights from the Report Include:

Cybersecurity and AI Lead IT Resource Allocation: Investment is heavily concentrated in cybersecurity initiatives, with 100% of surveyed airlines implementing advanced measures such as Privileged Account Management, SSO authentication, and DDoS protection. AI applications are similarly widespread, particularly in cybersecurity, operational scaling, and predictive disruption management.

Accelerated Data and AI Maturity: 72% of North American airlines already train AI models with collected data — more than double the global average (28%). Additionally, 9% have integrated large language models (LLMs) into their operations, versus just 2% globally.

Emerging Technologies Gaining Traction: Beyond AI, airlines are investing in technologies like business intelligence (BI) software (70%), computer vision (45%), and private 5G networks (38%).

Strategic Use of Innovation Partners: Over 80% of airlines reported collaboration with external partners in AI development, far outpacing global averages.

Heightened Cybersecurity Challenges: Ensuring the security of third-party vendors emerged as the top cybersecurity challenge, with 100% of respondents flagging it as a critical concern.

The research underscores the region’s leadership in leveraging technology for strategic advantage, not just operational efficiency. While enhancing security remains paramount, airlines are also positioning themselves to drive future innovations in data analytics, AI, and passenger experience.

According to a LinkedIn post by Kiri Hannifin, Chief Sustainability and Corporate Affairs Officer for Air New Zealand, and an airline statement, the decision to go from targets to guidance was due to the technological challenges and ""uncertainty"" in meeting the original targets. However, as Hannifin shared with the media, Air New Zealand continues to be committed to aviation sustainability .

Reviewing the latest - as of 1 May - 2030 emissions guidance shows that Air New Zealand is committed to driving emissions from jet fuel creation and combustion 20-30 percent down from 2019 levels by 2030. The airline intends to use carbon credits and, ""use 10 per cent SAF (as a percentage of total fuel) in 2030"" to achieve this goal. But as Hannifin explained on her LinkedIn post, ""We want to be very honest about what we think is possible given the challenges involved in decarbonising the aviation sector.""

Air New Zealand Continues SAF Commitment

The Air New Zealand goal to reduce emissions by 20-30 percent from jet fuel consumption depends largely on increasing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) supply. However, as Simple Flying has documented , increasing SAF supply is no easy feat worldwide. For Air New Zealand, there has been a worldwide search for over a year now .

The global search for more innovation in SAF development and delivery is because, as Hannifin shared with Simple Flying on March 20, 2024, ""A stable supply of SAF is critical to our ability to reduce carbon emissions."" Additionally, SAF is in short supply, and as Hannifin shared with NewstalkZB on May 1,

""[SAF's] the main way that airlines will decarbonize. ... There's hardly any available, so the more demand there is, the more supply there'll be available - and that will help get the prices down.""

One can listen to the May 1 interview below:

SAF Is Not Air New Zealand's Only Decarbonization Solution

Air New Zealand is also relying on other solutions to decarbonize. One of which is carbon credits to offset emissions via CORSIA . CORSIA stands for Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation. The scheme was established by ICAO pre-pandemic and seeks to cap CO2 emissions from international flights at 85% of 2019 levels, coupled with carbon-neutral growth for operations past 2020. However, according to the guidance, Air New Zealand will also buy ""approximately 11,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e)"" credits to supplement this and fund natural carbon removal efforts in New Zealand.

Additionally, there are two fleet solutions at work. The first is more efficient flying with computer aids. The second is renewing and maintaining a fleet with modern, more fuel-efficient aircraft. Below is a table of the current Air New Zealand fleet as of May 5 for reference:

Below is a 2022 YouTube about the Air New Zealand fleet plans:

Hannifin: ""Still Be A Stretch For Us""

Ultimately, one should consider what Hannifin posted in her LinkedIn that even with shifting from specific targets to guidance, and reaffirming the Air New Zealand commitment to reduce emissions, there are still challenges. Air New Zealand has to continue to increase the SAF supply, by for instance waste products from the forestry industry (aka logging) like sawdust and more. One can listen to the details below, thanks to another Hannifin interview on NewstalkZB with the magic of Spotify:

But additionally, as Hannifin posted to LinkedIn,

""For us, we want to be very honest about what we think is possible given the challenges involved in decarbonising the aviation sector. ... This will still be a stretch for us.

The partnership aims to produce synthetic aviation fuel, other synthetic fuels, and chemicals across Austria, the UAE, and northern and central Europe, reports Hydrogen Central.

In a joint statement issued Wednesday, Masdar’s Chief Green Hydrogen Officer Mohammad Abdelqader El Ramahi said the collaboration seeks to use the combined strengths of both companies to scale up the green hydrogen value chain.

“Masdar and OMV are combining forces to produce industrial-scale green hydrogen and related products, supporting the energy transition and advancing global decarbonization goals,” he said.

OMV Executive Vice President for Fuels, Feedstock and Chemicals Martijn van Koten added, “This partnership is about turning ideas into action. By exploring opportunities in green hydrogen and synthetic fuels, we’re looking to create real business value while setting new benchmarks for sustainability in Austria and the UAE.”

Masdar, a state-owned UAE energy company, has targeted annual production of 1 million metric tons of renewable hydrogen and derivatives by 2030.

OMV, which is partially owned by the Austrian government, plans to use green hydrogen to power its refineries as part of its strategy to achieve net-zero emissions across its full value chain (Scope 1-3) by 2050. Green hydrogen is produced by splitting water using electricity generated from renewable sources.

Separately on Wednesday, OMV also announced the start of production at its first commercial-scale green hydrogen plant, located at the Schwechat refinery in Austria. The EUR 25 million ($28.3 million) facility features a 10-megawatt polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer powered by hydro, solar, and wind energy.

The plant is expected to produce 1,500 metric tons of green hydrogen annually, reducing carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions by up to 15,000 metric tons—equivalent to the yearly carbon footprint of about 2,000 EU citizens, according to OMV. The hydrogen will be used to decarbonize refinery operations and produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.

“With this facility, we’re reinventing how everyday essentials are made—sustainably,” said van Koten. “By developing local green hydrogen production and supply chains, OMV is both advancing Europe’s climate objectives and strengthening industrial resilience.”

The facility is certified under the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) to produce renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs). The project received support from Austria’s Climate and Energy Fund.

In its financial report for Q1 2025, OMV posted a net profit of EUR 288 million—a 57% drop compared to Q1 2024. Net income attributable to parent company shareholders fell 70% to EUR 143 million, with earnings per share at EUR 0.44.

Sales revenue remained stable at EUR 6.22 billion, slightly down from EUR 6.26 billion year-over-year. Fuel and feedstock sales totaled EUR 3.82 billion, while energy sales stood at EUR 2.22 billion. Chemical sales rose to EUR 171 million.

OMV ended the quarter with EUR 1.34 billion in operating cash flow and EUR 317 million in free cash flow. The company reported EUR 12.68 billion in current assets, including EUR 5.68 billion in cash and equivalents, against EUR 7.74 billion in current liabilities.

Siekiame gaminti gerokai daugiau SAF kuro, nei reikės visai Baltijos šalių rinkai, tad didžiąją dalį savo pagaminto SAF ketiname eksportuoti“, – teigia jis.","„Avia Solutions Group“, didžiausia pasaulyje ACMI (orlaivių nuoma su įgula, technine priežiūra ir draudimu) paslaugas teikianti aviacijos įmonių grupė kartu su partneriais iš Latvijos LSEZ SIA „NORSAF“ pradeda vystyti ambicingą projektą – Liepojoje statys didžiausią regione tvaraus aviacinio kuro (angl. sustainable aviation fuel arba SAF) gamyklą, kurioje bus gaminamas ir sintetinis SAF. Pradėti kuro gamybą ji turėtų 2030 m. Pagamintas kuras bus ne tik siūlomas Šiaurės Europos šalims, bet ir aktyviai eksportuojamas į kitas pasaulio rinkas. Numatoma projekto investicija gali siekti 500-600 mln. Eur priklausomai nuo galutinio technologinio sprendimo, rašoma pranešime spaudai.

Šis ambicingas projektas yra pirmasis „Avia Solutions Group“ žingsnis į aviacinio kuro gamybos sritį. Kadangi projektas konkuruos tarptautinėje rinkoje, sėkmingam įgyvendinimui labai svarbu ir Europos Sąjungos, institucinių finansuotojų bei vietinės valdžios parama.

Kaip sako įmonių grupės generalinis direktorius Jonas Janukėnas, šiuo metu aviacijos įmonės aktyviai ieško sprendimų, kurie prisidėtų prie tvaraus aviacijos sektoriaus vystymosi ir atlieptų naujus tvarumo standartus, įskaitant sintetinio SAF gamybą.

Aviacijos ateitimi vadinamas SAF – tai tvarus aviacinis kuras, kuris generuoja ženkliai mažiau šiltnamio dujų emisijų. Šiuo metu jis dažniausiai gaminamas iš panaudoto aliejaus, biomasės, etilo alkoholio ir kitų organinių šaltinių. Nuo šių metų įsigaliojo Europos Sąjungos reikalavimas, kad didesniuose oro uostuose bent 2 proc. viso sunaudojamo kuro turi būti SAF tipo. Šis mandatas palaipsniui kils, 2030 m. jau sieks 6 proc., 2035 m. – 20 proc. 2050 m. jo dalis jau turėti siekti 70 proc.

„Svarbu suprasti, kad 2030 m. atsiras dar viena svarbi sąlyga – iš viso patiekiamo SAF 1,2 proc. turės būti sintetinis. Toks kuras gaminamas be biologinių komponentų – naudojant žaliąją energiją gaminamas vandenilis, kuris maišomas su anglies dvideginiu. Šis mandatas irgi palaipsniui augs, ir 2050 m. jau pusė viso SAF kuro privalės būti sintetinis. Taigi permainos aviacijos sektoriuje jau vyksta pilnu tempu“, – sako „Avia Solutions Group“ priklausančios tarptautinės antžeminių paslaugų, orlaivių degalų tiekimo ir logistikos paslaugų įmonių grupės „Baltic Ground Services“ („BGS“) vadovas ir Norsaf valdybos narys Vytautas Čekanavičius.

Dėl naujų reikalavimų, oro linijos palaipsniui turės pirkti vis daugiau SAF kuro, o 2030 m. dabartiniai gamybiniai pajėgumai jau nebegalės patenkinti augančio poreikio. Anot V. Čekanavičiaus, Liepojoje bus naudojama JAV įmonės „KBR“ vystoma gamybos technologija, kai naudojamas alkoholis, bet į procesą įtraukiamas ir vandenilis su CO2. Tai reiškia, kad bus gaminamas tiek paprastas, tiek sintetinis SAF kuras.

„Liepojos Laisvojoje ekonominėje zonoje yra ir vamzdynai, ir geležinkelio linija, čia jau vyksta ir etanolio perkrova, planuojama, kad atsiras ir žaliojo vandenilio gamykla. Kitaip tariant, egzistuoja didelė dalis mums reikalingos infrastruktūros. Šiuo metu vyksta derybos ir su viena didele kompanija, kurios išskiriamą CO2 naudotume savo sintetinio SAF gamybai“, – dėsto „BGS“ vadovas.

Kaip sako LSEZ SIA „NORSAF“ valdybos narys Janis Kisiels, naujosios SAF gamyklos projektas ypatingai reikšmingas visam regionui. Jį įgyvendinus, augs ir Baltijos šalių energetinis saugumas, gerokai sutrumpės tiekimo grandinės.

„Ši gamykla yra labai geras pavyzdys, kaip dirbdamos išvien mūsų šalių kompanijos gali įgyvendinti pačius didžiausius ir ambicingiausius projektus ir taip prisidėti prie žaliosios aviacijos transformacijos. Siekiame gaminti gerokai daugiau SAF kuro, nei reikės visai Baltijos šalių rinkai, tad didžiąją dalį savo pagaminto SAF ketiname eksportuoti“, – teigia jis.

Planuojama, kad naujoji Liepojos gamykla kasmet pagamintų 100 tūkst. tonų SAF. Palyginimui, šiuo metu visuose Baltijos šalių oro uostose sunaudojama apie 400 tūkst. tonų aviacinio kuro, o pagal dabartinį 2 proc. mandatą, rinkai dabar reikia tik apie 8 tūkst. tonų SAF.

„Dirbame su potencialiais tiekėjais, partneriais, investuotojais, ES institucijomis. Mūsų planas ir ambicija 2027 m. pradėti statybas, ir 2030 m. jau gaminti SAF kurą. Projektas milžiniškas, bet tikime, kad įdėto darbo rezultatas bus vertas pasididžiavimo ir turės įtakos aviacijos pramonės tvarumui“, – teigia V.

With support from the UK Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ), MZT has kicked off a DAC plant in Norfolk that will serve to pull down atmospheric CO2 to be used for the production of manufactured limestone by O.C.O Technology (O.C.O.).

Current estimates say that once operational at full capacity, this DAC plant will be able to remove around 250 tonnes of CO2 per year.

For partnering company O.C.O., which utilizes captured CO2 to produce sustainable construction materials, this DAC deployment will enable a reliable and sustainable on-site source of carbon dioxide, optimizing the supply and protecting against price and availability fluctuations.

Dr. Nicholas Chadwick, MZT co-founder and CEO, commented, “With the construction sector being one of the largest contributors to global carbon emissions, the industry needs to rapidly rethink its carbon backbone — and creating sustainable building materials which double as carbon sinks is a great way to do just that.”

«We use 70% less energy to remove CO2,» Amir Shiner, RepAir Carbon CEO

This deployment marks the third ambitious DAC initiative announced by Mission Zero Technologies.

A joint effort between the World Economic Forum (WEF) and Temasek-backed, decarbonisation-focused investment company GenZero, it will educate organisations to become more familiar and competent with sustainable aviation fuel and sustainable aviation fuel certificates (SAFC), promote the use of both, enable test purchases and encourage partnerships between regional corporations and airlines.

Frederick Teo, chief executive officer of GenZero, said: “The Asia-Pacific region has a unique opportunity to lead in sustainable aviation fuels, but unlocking this potential requires stronger demand signals.”

He added that the initiative can provide the technical clarity and corporate commitment needed to scale sustainable aviation fuel adoption, and “by mobilising corporates and airlines, we can create the certainty needed to spur innovation, scale production and make lower-emission flights a reality”.

Sustainable aviation fuel is jet fuel made from renewable sources that include biofuel, waste or synthetics.

As it can be used in existing jet engines and reduce emissions by up to 80 per cent, it is the most viable way of reducing the emissions of air travel. However, it is hampered by its high cost (three to five times more than regular jet fuel), low production and uncertain demand.

According to the International Air Transport Association, sustainable aviation fuel accounted for 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production in 2024.

SAFC will help organisations administer emissions reductions for using sustainable aviation fuel, using a framework developed by WEF’s Clean Skies For Tomorrow initiative. It will allow both airlines and corporate travel to track and claim emissions reductions from flights using sustainable aviation fuel.

Sixteen organisations are participating, including the banks DBS, Mizuho and UOB; aircraft maker Boeing; airlines Air New Zealand, Qantas Group and Singapore Airlines; sustainable aviation fuel producer Neste; and logistics company DHL.

Green Fuel Forward’s efforts will include education and training on key topics, plus hands-on exercises such as legally compliant test purchases of sustainable aviation fuel and SAFC.

According to a 2024 report, South-east Asia has the potential to supply 12 per cent of the world’s sustainable aviation fuel by 2050. The Asia-Pacific is the largest passenger aviation market in the world, and is also expected to lead sector growth in the next few years.

DHL’s blend of speed, visibility, and brand assurance gives it an edge in markets where logistics reliability can directly impact revenue cycles.","When DHL Express announced last week the renewal of its partnership with the Mumbai Indians for a fifth consecutive year, it was more than a routine sponsorship extension. Beneath the surface of this feel-good cricket-and-commerce story lies a deeper narrative—one that offers insights into how international logistics providers are reshaping their brand relevance in one of the world’s most dynamic markets, and aligning closely with domestic connectivity goals that include, crucially, air cargo growth.

The renewed partnership keeps DHL Express as the principal sponsor for India’s most successful cricket franchise. But while the public face is fan engagement and climate-conscious campaigns, the underlying strategy speaks to DHL’s long game: expanding its reach and relevance in India’s air express and time-definite cargo segments, where competition with both international integrators and emerging domestic players is intensifying.

Beyond branding

India’s air cargo sector, valued at approximately US$2.3 billion in 2024, is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 10 percent through 2030, according to government and industry data. With the government’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, rapid e-commerce expansion, and rollout of multi-modal logistics hubs under Gati Shakti, demand for precision logistics services is rising sharply.

DHL Express, long a dominant player in the premium segment, is clearly aligning its cultural visibility with this growth arc. Cricket, particularly the IPL, offers unparalleled reach in India — with over 500 million viewers across platforms — but its value to air cargo professionals is not just in visibility. It is in symbolic alignment with India’s evolving needs: agility, speed, and integration.

“Sports and logistics share a common thread — both work on the qualities of precision and agility,” Sandeep Juneja, Vice President, Sales and Marketing at DHL Express India, said. “Our continued relationship [with Mumbai Indians] is a testament to our shared pursuit of success.”

In that phrasing is an implicit recognition that air cargo in India is becoming less transactional and more brand-driven, where service reliability and time performance (rather than price alone) define market share. The Mumbai Indians’ values — excellence, teamwork, speed — become brand proxies for DHL’s logistics ethos.

The ‘team behind the team’

From a cargo operations standpoint, DHL Express is already an essential player in time-definite international movements into and out of India’s key air gateways: Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru. Its “team behind the team” tagline may be rooted in sport, but operationally, it mirrors DHL’s role in enabling just-in-time logistics for India’s SMEs, pharma, and tech manufacturers.

For example, DHL’s reliance on the air cargo segment is evident in its operational infrastructure in India. The company operates a dedicated freighter fleet and makes extensive use of belly-hold cargo space across commercial airlines — all coordinated through its central hubs in Leipzig and Hong Kong. India’s rising exports — with FY 2024–25 merchandise exports pegged at US$447 billion — represent a strategic opportunity, especially as micro-enterprises seek faster routes to global markets.

By linking its express brand with cricketing excellence, DHL is not merely chasing eyeballs. It is embedding itself in national consciousness as a trusted operator in a country that still faces significant logistics bottlenecks, including limited cold chain integration, fragmented warehousing, and volatile ground transport.

he partnership’s ‘Six for a Cause’ campaign — wherein DHL plants six trees for every six hit by a Mumbai Indians player — adds a layer of climate consciousness to the mix. Last season, 133 sixes resulted in nearly 800 trees being planted. While modest in carbon terms, such initiatives align with the growing pressure on logistics firms to decarbonise.

India’s draft Air Cargo Policy and the National Logistics Policy (NLP) both call for “greener cargo corridors,” and DHL, like its peers, is under regulatory and reputational pressure to reduce Scope 3 emissions. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) investments, carbon-neutral warehousing, and route optimisation will all become material indicators in the years ahead. Campaigns like DHL’s, though PR-oriented, provide public linkage between cargo movement and climate responsibility — a necessary narrative as India pushes for net-zero aviation by 2070.

Strategic signal

The partnership also sends a signal to India’s fast-growing domestic express players — Delhivery, Ecom Express, and India Post’s revamped logistics division among them — that DHL is doubling down on local mindshare even as its physical infrastructure grows.

With India’s intra-regional air cargo expected to grow at 12–14 percent CAGR, especially from Tier 2 and 3 cities, cultural partnerships will play a role in influencing procurement decisions, particularly among MSMEs and digitally enabled retailers.

Australia’s election gives LNG, fuels sector certainty

Australia’s election gives LNG, fuels sector certainty

Sydney, 5 May (Argus) — Australia's governing Labor party's second majority term could mean that changes to the offshore permitting regime promised last year are signed into law, while east coast LNG businesses will avoid a planned reservation system proposed by the opposition. Labor's victory at the 3 May election combined with the election of fewer members from the Greens party and climate-focused independents, could mean it faces less pressure to cancel fossil fuel projects. But it will remain reliant on the Greens to pass laws through the nation's upper house — the senate — meaning Labor may need to negotiate the passage of bills with the leftist party if the Liberal-National-based coalition opposes its measures. The Greens ran on a promise to ban new coal, oil and gas projects but won fewer seats than in 2022 because of preference flows. A federal decision on the lifetime extension of the Woodside Energy-operated 14.4mn t/yr North West Shelf (NWS) LNG delayed by Labor, is now looking more positive for the firm. The firm sees approval as vital to progressing its Browse gas development offshore northwestern Australia. Voters' rejection of the opposition Coalition on the nation's east coast means its policy to reserve a further 50-100PJ (1.34bn-2.68bn m³/yr) from the Gladstone-based LNG exporters will not proceed. The result provides an opportunity for certainty and stability for the energy sector, upstream lobby Australian Energy Producers said. The group urged the government to focus on new supply as Australia's gas reserves for domestic use rapidly deplete. The government will need to specify exactly how it aims to secure supplies to ensure stable supply, once coal-fired generators retire at the end of the 2020s and into the 2030s. This is because the nation's integrated system plan is based on Labor's policy of reaching 82pc renewable energy in the power grid, backed up by about 15GW of gas-fired power. Industry will await further direction stemming from the Future Gas Strategy which canvassed solutions to Australia's declining gas supply including new pipelines, storage and seasonal LNG imports. Permitting concerns In the government's previous three-year term, a series of court-ordered requirements to consult with affected Aboriginal groups briefly disrupted multi-billion dollar LNG developments. Labor promised to specify through new laws exactly which groups must be consulted before approvals could be granted. But these were dropped from the agenda in early 2024 following opposition by the Greens. Labor's resources minister Madeleine King blamed the Greens for obstructionist manoeuvres on this legislation, but it remains unclear if and when Labor might introduce such laws. Conversely, the Coalition promised to end government support for anti-gas lobbies such as law group the Environmental Defenders Office — set to continue under Labor. In liquid fuels, Labor's victory should boost Australia's electric vehicle (EV) sales, with emissions standards laws set to remain enforced. The Coalition had said it would soften the laws because of concern over cost of living pressures. Plans to temporarily cut the fuel excise will also not progress. Australia's EV take-up has stalled, and industry has blamed this on poor investment in recharging infrastructure and other policy settings, including the removal of the fringe benefits tax exemption for plug-in hybrid car models. A re-elected Labor government is likely to further policy towards a mandate for sustainable aviation fuel or renewable diesel, given the growing share of Australia's emissions projected to come from the transport industry. It pledged A$250mn ($162mn) for low-carbon liquid fuels development in March , for low-carbon liquid fuels development in March, as part of its commitment to the nascent sector. Local market participants are optimistic that further biofuels support will be provided as urgency to meet net zero ambitions builds, including a 2030 target of 43pc lower emissions based on 2005 levels. About A$6bn/yr of feedstocks like canola, tallow and used cooking oil are exported from Australia, while existing ethanol and biodiesel producers are running underutilised plants, making about 175mn litres/yr at present, because of poorly-enforced blending mandates.

This shorter booking curve allows Virgin Atlantic Cargo to assess and capitalise on new opportunities in emerging markets more swiftly.","Five months into his role, Nick Diesel, Virgin Atlantic Cargo’s recently-appointed Managing Director, is looking to bring his experience from leading the team through post-pandemic recovery to support the carrier throughout turbulent economic conditions and global supply chain disruptions.

“I’ve been with Virgin Atlantic for about ten years, but I’ve only been in this particular role for five months, I’m still learning ,” Diesel told Air Cargo Week. “During my time at the airline, I’ve gained broad experience across a number of departments, which I think has helped me in this new role.

“When the pandemic hit, we had to pivot quickly. We were operating in what seemed like a temporary crisis, but it turned out to be something much longer-lasting and more disruptive,” Diesel shared.

“The biggest lesson I learned during that time was that you can never predict what’s around the corner and so need to focus on what you can control. You can have your best estimates, but it’s crucial to keep plans flexible and simple so we can quickly adapt.”

This adaptable mindset has proven crucial in the current environment. “In the cargo world, we’re fortunate to be a smaller operation compared to some of the larger players,” Diesel noted. “This allows us to be more agile and try out new solutions that can drive improvements. We have a fantastic team, and the pace of technological advancement is exciting for us. We’re actively looking at business automation and exploring tools that will help us move more efficiently and stay ahead of the curve.”

Prepared for unpredictability

Despite the current challenges, Diesel sees the airline’s ability to innovate, adapt, and build strong relationships with its team and customers as key factors for long-term success.

“The landscape is changing rapidly, and we’re exploring everything from automation in back-office functions to dynamic pricing strategies. There’s a lot of potential here, and I think we’ve only scratched the surface. Over the next few months, I’ll be focusing on understanding how we can use these tools effectively to better serve our customers and further improve our operations,” Diesel expressed.

“The political climate, and global supply chain disruptions are definitely a significant influence on everything we’re doing, but we’re focused on staying flexible and continuously improving,” he said. “I’m excited about where we can go from here, and I have confidence that our team will continue to rise to the occasion.”

Potential through passenger travel

With its position as a belly-hold cargo operator, Virgin Atlantic’s extensive passenger network provides significant advantages but also presents certain operational challenges.

By leveraging this network, the company can bring cargo directly into major city locations and key destinations, maximising available capacity on flights that would otherwise be empty. However, to make this work, there’s a delicate balance to strike—ensuring that both passenger demand and cargo opportunities are optimiSed without compromising profitability on either side.

“There are two main components to this,” Diesel explained. “First, how do we maximise the opportunity with the existing network? And second, how do we shape the strategic direction of Virgin Atlantic to ensure that cargo has a strong voice in decision-making?”

“We’re fortunate to have senior leaders with extensive cargo experience and so we understand the contribution cargo makes to Virgin Atlantic’s financial performance.

“We’ve also made a significant shift by framing our cargo team as the ‘fourth cabin’ at Virgin Atlantic, alongside economy, premium, and upper class,” Diesel revealed. “This shift has helped us highlight the value that cargo adds to our network, positioning it as a key part of Virgin Atlantic’s offering, alongside our holidays and loyalty programmes. This approach has given cargo a stronger, more prominent role.”

Speedier set up

The quick ramp-up time for cargo compared to passengers is another significant advantage for Virgin Atlantic Cargo. While the booking window for passenger flights can extend up to 18 months, cargo bookings tend to have a much shorter lead time—often just two weeks. This shorter booking curve allows Virgin Atlantic Cargo to assess and capitalise on new opportunities in emerging markets more swiftly.

“This makes it easier to quickly assess cargo opportunities in new markets,” Diesel explained. “We’re about to wrap up our plan, which outlines our strategy through 2025, and we’re already preparing for the next strategic plan for 2030.

“What’s been really positive is the opportunity to influence the selection of potential markets early on. We’re able to input directly into the process, suggesting markets based on customer demand, rather than having the passenger network team come to us later with potential routes.”

“We’ve also made a significant shift by framing our cargo team as the ‘fourth cabin’ at Virgin Atlantic, alongside economy, premium, and upper class,” Diesel revealed. “This shift has helped us highlight the value that cargo adds to our network, positioning it as a key part of Virgin Atlantic’s offering, alongside our holidays and loyalty programs. This approach has given cargo a stronger, more prominent role.”

A notable example of this alignment in action is Virgin Atlantic’s expansion into markets like India, where cargo has played a critical role in supporting the profitability of these routes. As geopolitical situations shift, particularly in regions like the Red Sea, the cargo division’s performance has provided a boost to the airline’s growth in new markets.

“ Cargo is able to reach maturity much quicker in new markets, playing a key role in supporting route profitability,” Diesel shared.

Internal collaboration

To capitalise on the full scale of opportunity in the industry, Virgin Atlantic Cargo is focused on optimising its operations through closer teamwork with its different departments, with Diesel having prioritised engagement with staff and customers across the network during his first months in the role.

“It’s been fantastic to meet our teams and customers. Most of the feedback has been very positive, which is always great to hear,” Diesel remarked. “We’re committed to ensuring that our people are empowered, supported, and clear on their roles, especially when facing challenges. This level of communication and support is what makes us stronger as a team.”

Drawing from his time working in finance and data , Diesel presented a unique perspective on how Virgin Atlantic Cargo can adapt to economic challenges: “My experience in financial planning and procurement has been invaluable in this role. I’m constantly learning from my colleagues, including a number of people in our senior leadership team who have vast experience in cargo. Together, we’re focused on staying on track and making the right decisions for the future.”

Serious about sustainability

Sustainability is no longer just a buzzword but a core principle that influences nearly every aspect of operations, from fuel sources to fleet management, and even local facility practices.

“We were really excited about the success of our 100 percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) flight, which was a huge milestone for the airline,” Diesel shared. “What’s often not mentioned is that we also carried cargo on that flight—not just people.

“We worked closely with key customers to make it happen, and the key message we wanted to convey is that if enough SAF is produced, we will fly it. That’s the point we’re driving home:the barrier is not operational it is one of price and scale”

The 100 percent SAF flight marks just one part of Virgin Atlantic’s broader strategy for sustainability. Diesel explained that there are two main areas the airline is focusing on to reduce its environmental footprint: the fleet and the fuel.

“82 percent of our aircraft are next-generation, averaging 6.9 years old, and by 2028, once all of our 16 A330neos arrive, we will be 100 percent next generation,”Diesel revealed. “While much of the conversation around sustainability focuses on future innovations, we’ve already made substantial progress in terms of fleet renewal, which has led to significant reductions in emissions.

“SAF production needs to scale, and that’s something we’re advocating for on a government level,” Diesel explained. “We’re supporting efforts to ensure that both the pricing and the supply of SAF are sustainable in the long term, so airlines have the certainty needed to plan for a future that’s both greener and more cost-effective. And the support of our Cargo customers is of vital importance, they are major purchasers of Sustainable Aviation Fuel Certificates (SAFc) and their contribution to the SAF we buy helps to reduce their carbon footprint, support the growth of SAF, and achieve their sustainability goals”.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-02-at-13.23.05-1080x721.png,N,,2025-05-05 07:57:47.644193

“[SAF credits] can be very powerful in capitalising more demand,” GenZero’s chief executive Frederick Teo told Eco-Business.
In 2022, GenZero, together with national carrier Singapore Airlines and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), piloted the sale of 1,000 SAF credits from a trial to procure SAF for the city-state’s airport.
They will have the opportunity to undertake a test purchase of SAF and SAF credits by next year, GenZero stated in its joint press release with WEF.
There are currently no methodologies to generate SAF carbon credits, though Gold Standard has plans to develop one for fuel switching in aviation.","Temasek-owned decarbonisation platform GenZero, alongside the World Economic Forum (WEF), has launched a new regional coalition to overcome sluggish demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), in a bid to accelerate the decarbonisation of Asia’s rapidly growing aviation sector.

Announced on Monday at the GenZero Climate Summit 2025 held in Singapore, the Green Fuel Forward initiative brings together airlines, logistics providers and corporates to support the offtake of green jet fuel through the use of SAF credits, which each represent one metric tonne of SAF.

These credits can be purchased by entities outside of the aviation industry to offset their Scope 3 emissions, stemming from indirect value chain activities such as business travel and air freight, without having to directly procure the underlying green fuel product. This relatively novel asset class, which is traded and recorded using a “book and claim” system, is meant to open up a new revenue stream to bring down the costs of SAF and further scale its production.

“[SAF credits] can be very powerful in capitalising more demand,” GenZero’s chief executive Frederick Teo told Eco-Business. “If we make it cheaper, there will be more demand… With that kind of expanded demand, you give a signal to producers to invest in supply because they know there will be that kind of demand. That is the theory of change.”

“If corporates are prepared to offset some of their air travel emissions by buying and using SAF credits instead of just purchasing other kinds of credits, then the money we’re using to offset our Scope 3 is directly going into subsidising airlines and airports in purchasing SAF,” said Teo.

Aviation accounted for 2.5 per cent of global energy-related carbon emissions in 2023. While SAF is key towards decarbonising the sector, short of reducing air travel, one of the most significant barriers to its widespread production has been the substantial green premium airlines have to pay to make the switch from conventional jet fuel. In 2025, International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF – which currently only accounts for 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production – will cost about US$2,500 per tonne, or about 3.8 times the cost of traditional fuel.

The absence of uniform policies and mandates across the region has also resulted in fragmented demand among airlines, which have been more focused on ramping up flights post-pandemic. Unlike Europe, which mandates 2 per cent SAF usage for flights departing from the European Union and United Kingdom airports as of this year, the first compulsory use of SAF in Asia will only begin in 2026, when Singapore and Thailand enforce a 1 per cent mandate.

Teo praised Singapore’s SAF mandate model – which will be implemented through a levy on air tickets rather than a strict fuel blending mandate – as an innovative way of boosting demand for green jet fuel while shielding airlines and passengers from the price volatility associated with it.

Corporates who are willing to pay hundreds of dollars per tonne of carbon dioxide to offset their business travel emissions can therefore receive credits in return for subsidising SAF procured to reduce the Scope 1, or direct, emissions of airlines.

In 2022, GenZero, together with national carrier Singapore Airlines and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), piloted the sale of 1,000 SAF credits from a trial to procure SAF for the city-state’s airport. About two-thirds of the credits generated were sold to corporates and air cargo companies – which was less successful than expected.

“Demand wasn’t as strong, people were not too familiar with the product, and ultimately, because it was a more expensive product, there was no willingness [to invest in SAF],” said CAAS’ chief sustainability officer Daniel Ng at a conference last year.

16 organisations have joined GenZero’s new initiative, including Air New Zealand, Boeing, Climate Impact X, DBS Bank, DHL, International Energy Agency, Mizuho, Nete, Qantas Group, Singapore Airlines, Temasek and UOB. They will have the opportunity to undertake a test purchase of SAF and SAF credits by next year, GenZero stated in its joint press release with WEF.

There are currently no methodologies to generate SAF carbon credits, though Gold Standard has plans to develop one for fuel switching in aviation. The industry body Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials, which is also part of the new coalition, has also developed a book and claim system to ensure there is no double counting of credits.

Supply outpacing demand

While Southeast Asia is home to abundant feedstock resources, including used cooking oil, palm oil residues and municipal waste, the region’s biggest challenge lies in turning production capacity into actual consumption.

At least five new SAF facilities are set to come online in the Asia Pacific region within the next two years, threatening to outpace regional demand.

Air New Zealand, for instance, halved its SAF target for 2030 from to 10 per cent last year due to affordability concerns. SAF currently makes up only 1.6 per cent of its total fuel supply. Meanwhile, airline operators that are part of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines, such as Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways, are cautiously pursuing a voluntary SAF usage goal of 5 per cent by the end of this decade.

This gap between where SAF is produced and where demand is located has led Asia to export over 370,000 tonnes of SAF in 2024, according to ship tracking data from Kpler – mostly from Finnish producer Neste’s Singapore refinery, the world’s largest production facility.

“The Asia-Pacific region has a unique opportunity to lead in sustainable aviation fuels, but unlocking this potential requires stronger demand signals,” said Teo. “By mobilising corporates and airlines, we can create the certainty needed to spur innovation, scale production, and make lower-emission flights a reality.”",https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/854af4fe91c324cc_org.png?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,N,,2025-05-05 07:58:27.978888

In an era of escalating climate concerns and energy challenges, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is emerging as a critical component in the decarbonisation of the global aviation sector.

Traditional fossil fuels have powered our aircraft for over a century but come at a steep environmental cost. With aviation emissions coming under increasing scrutiny, international mandates -- particularly in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the US -- are setting ambitious targets for SAF use. It is a transformative solution for the aviation sector, derived from renewable resources such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, forestry by-products and even municipal solid waste. For Pakistan, an economy blessed with abundant agricultural resources, this global shift presents a unique opportunity to transform its aviation and energy sectors alike.

The production of SAF involves a two-step process. First, the feedstock is converted into an intermediate product, which is subsequently refined in the second step to produce the final SAF. The choice of production technology depends on the type of renewable feedstock, which can be classified into four main categories: lipid-based feedstocks (such as used cooking oil, animal fats, and non-edible vegetable oils), sugar-based feedstocks (such as wheat straw, rice husks and bagasse), lignin-rich feedstocks (e.g., forestry residues), and carbon dioxide (CO2).

Although a range of technologies exist for processing these feedstocks, only Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), which converts waste oils, fats and greases into SAF via hydroprocessing, and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ), which processes sugar-based alcohols such as ethanol or butanol through dehydration and oligomerisation, have been commercialised to date.

Emerging technologies like Hydroprocessed Catalytic Fast Pyrolysis Oil (HCFPO) and Catalytic Hydrothermolysis Jet (CHJ) are particularly suitable for lignin-rich feedstocks. HCFPO employs catalytic fast pyrolysis (thermal decomposition) to produce bio-oils, which are then hydroprocessed into SAF.

CHJ, on the other hand, utilises hydrothermal liquefaction (thermochemical process) to convert feedstocks into biocrude, followed by hydroprocessing to refine it into SAF. This process mimics the natural formation of crude oil by applying heat and pressure to biomass.

CO2 represents one of the most radical and promising feedstocks in the quest for SAF. Industry leaders are exploring innovative techniques that convert CO2, captured directly from the atmosphere or concentrated point sources, into energy-dense SAF. This breakthrough approach offers a pathway to mitigate atmospheric CO2 levels and paves the way for a circular carbon economy in which waste emissions are transformed into valuable resources.

The conversion of CO2 into SAF is achieved through three primary pathways: biological, chemical, and electrical. The biological pathway utilises genetically engineered microorganisms to convert CO2 into intermediary products, such as oils or alcohols. The chemical pathway employs advanced catalytic systems to synthesise hydrocarbons from CO2 directly. Meanwhile, the electrical pathway leverages renewable energy to drive electrochemical reactors, reducing CO2 into intermediates that can subsequently be refined into SAF. Europe is pioneering advancements in electrochemical conversion, while Australia is at the forefront of biological innovation in this field.

Technological advancements now also enable the co-production of diesel alongside SAF. This innovation creates new opportunities for sustainable fuel solutions, accelerating the transition to cleaner energy.

The investment required for an SAF biorefinery yields considerable economic dividends despite its multibillion-dollar price tag at larger scales. Direct job creation triggers a ripple effect, driving indirect employment, supply-chain stimulation and cross-sectoral economic activities

SAF technologies enable scalable production, with capacities ranging from 100,000 tonnes to as much as one million tonnes annually. While large-scale refineries demand multibillion-dollar investments, their economic influence reaches far beyond their price tags. These facilities have the potential to generate thousands of direct and indirect jobs, serving as catalysts for regional development.

The construction phase of a SAF biorefinery involves extensive capital expenditure, spurring local contractors, suppliers, and related service providers. This financial injection stimulates regional development, strengthens infrastructure, and supports ancillary industries. Beyond the significant workforce required during development, once operational, the refinery will generate a few hundred direct jobs spanning plant operations, quality assurance, engineering, maintenance and administrative roles, alongside a range of support positions such as security personnel and drivers.

This scale of direct job creation triggers a ripple effect, driving indirect employment across multiple industries. For instance, ancillary industries such as feedstock production, transportation and logistics, equipment manufacturing, construction, and maintenance services are likely to benefit substantially. Based on analyses of similar renewable energy projects worldwide, it is reasonable to anticipate that an additional four to six indirect positions would emerge for every direct job generated. This would translate into thousands of indirect jobs associated with the SAF biorefinery project on a regional scale.

The economic impact extends further into several related industries. The agricultural sector, in particular, stands to gain as local farmers supply biomass feedstocks -- such as sugarcane bagasse, rice husks or other crop residues -- creating a steady demand stabilising rural incomes and encouraging sustainable agricultural practices.

On a national level, establishing a SAF biorefinery in Pakistan would contribute significantly to energy security by reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels. Developing a home-grown SAF industry would also position Pakistan as one of the players in the global transition to renewable energies. As international markets increasingly favour sustainable and low-emission fuels, Pakistan could benefit from enhanced export opportunities.

The technological advancements and demonstration projects associated with SAF production could also spur innovation across Pakistan’s energy sector, further diversifying the country’s economic base. Additionally, this progress would influence research and development, foster innovation, and strengthen environmental services, transforming universities into leading hubs for sustainable fuel research.

The starting point in the transition to SAF requires a dynamic, multipronged approach that integrates investment, industrial development, and innovation. A well-defined strategy must prioritise attracting foreign investment, equipping local industries with the necessary infrastructure and expertise, and fostering a robust research and development ecosystem.

The investment required for an SAF biorefinery yields considerable economic dividends despite its multibillion-dollar price tag at larger scales. Direct job creation triggers a ripple effect, driving indirect employment, supply-chain stimulation and cross-sectoral economic activities, potentially multiplying these benefits severalfold. Ultimately, such investments are a vital pillar of regional and national growth. By transforming waste and renewable feedstocks into high-value SAF, Pakistan can simultaneously address environmental imperatives while laying the foundation for a more resilient and diversified economy.

Pakistan’s energy crisis is technical, economic, institutional and strategic. It is no longer enough to tweak the margins of Pakistan’s power sector. The deepening crisis of rising tariffs, circular debt and unutilised renewable energy calls for a fundamental rethink of the system’s architecture.

The idea of sector-coupling -- connecting electricity production with industrial use, transport and hydrogen generation -- offers a new lifeline. This opportunity is most vivid in Thatta, which hosts some of the country’s most productive wind corridors. Here, amid gusts of clean energy often left unused, lies the potential to recast Pakistan’s energy dilemma into an economic advantage. The conversion of surplus wind energy into green hydrogen could not only resolve the financial paradox of Non-Project Missed Volume (NPMV) but also position Pakistan as a future exporter in the burgeoning global hydrogen market, expected to reach $38.1 billion by 2029, from $5.2 billion in 2024.

The roots of this opportunity lie in a problem that has been festering for years. Pakistan’s energy governance model, structured around rigid power purchase agreements and a grid ill-equipped for intermittent generation, has led to a bizarre situation where the country is paying for electricity it cannot use. This is Non-Project Missed Volume -- payments made to wind and solar power producers even when their output cannot be dispatched due to grid constraints. These payments surged from just under Rs1.9 billion in FY2021–22 to a staggering Rs39.5 billion in FY2023–24. At this rate, the power sector is quite literally bleeding cash while the wind blows and the sun shines, further fueling the Rs2.3 trillion circular debt.

Under pressure from fiscal deficits and global lenders, the government has responded by renegotiating Power Purchase Agreements with Independent Power Producers (IPPs), including those based on renewable energy. While this may offer short-term fiscal relief, it has severely dented investor confidence. Global lenders such as the IFC, ADB and Proparco have raised red flags. The perception of contract sanctity has eroded. The risk premium for renewable energy projects in Pakistan has increased, making capital more expensive or altogether unavailable. In this environment of uncertainty, the renewable energy sector, which had just begun to find its feet, is now once again on shaky ground.

This is where sector-coupling enters the conversation -- not as a buzzword but as a viable strategy. The principle is simple: link the energy sector with other sectors of the economy to create new demand, enhance efficiency, and reduce waste. In the case of Thatta, the focus is on converting curtailed wind energy into green hydrogen through electrolysis. This hydrogen can then be used across industrial, transport, and even power generation sectors. In fertiliser production, it can replace fossil fuel-based feedstock. In transport, it can serve as fuel for heavy vehicles. And in the global market, it represents a valuable export commodity with exponentially growing demand, especially for countries seeking to decarbonise aviation, shipping, and heavy industry.

Pakistan has the technical potential to produce nearly 69 million metric tons of green hydrogen annually, particularly in resource-rich areas like Sindh and Balochistan. Currently, its hydrogen export value is negligible, estimated at just $24,700 in 2023. But the international market is poised for an explosion, with low-emissions hydrogen required to scale from under one million tonnes in 2022 to at least 70 million tonnes by 2030 under the IEA Net Zero scenario. Countries like Germany, Japan, and South Korea are investing heavily in future off-take agreements. For Pakistan, this isn’t just about technology but about timing. If it can create a functioning green hydrogen value chain, from generation to storage to transport and export, it can emerge as a competitive player in this high-growth market.

The sector-coupling model anchored in Thatta can help Pakistan kill two birds with one wind turbine. It offers a structural solution to the NPMV crisis and creates a new export industry aligned with global decarbonisation trends. It could become a template for other regions, such as Gwadar or coastal Balochistan

Thatta’s Special Economic Zones (SEZs), already receiving incentives under CPEC, offer the perfect experimental ground. These zones can be repurposed or newly designated as ‘Green Hydrogen Zones’, where tailored policy support, such as tax exemptions, customs relief and infrastructure facilitation, can be provided. India has already exempted SEZ-based green hydrogen projects from the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) requirement. Kenya has integrated hydrogen incentives into its Export Processing Zones. Pakistan can adopt similar models to attract both domestic and international investors, especially those seeking to diversify hydrogen supply chains away from saturated European hubs.

The benefits of such a strategy cut across stakeholder lines. For the government, it provides a long-term reduction in circular debt and enhanced energy security by reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels, which currently account for over 60% of primary energy. For consumers, it promises lower electricity tariffs in the long run, as more flexible energy systems reduce reliance on costly imported LNG or furnace oil. For the renewable sector, especially wind producers in Thatta, it offers a guaranteed buyer for their electricity, even when the grid cannot absorb it. This stabilises revenue streams and enhances the bankability of future projects.

Yet, as with all ambitious strategies, there are hurdles. The capital cost of hydrogen production is still high. Electrolysers, compressors, storage tanks, and desalination facilities for water are not cheap. Today’s Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) in Pakistan is estimated at $3.90–4.27 per kg, still above global export price competitiveness. Wind speeds in Thatta, though historically reliable, have shown a declining trend since 2009 -- a factor that must be studied before making large-scale commitments. Moreover, a clear regulatory framework for hydrogen production, safety standards, pricing mechanisms and export protocols is still missing in Pakistan. These gaps must be urgently addressed through a national hydrogen strategy.

Policymakers must also be sensitive to social and environmental concerns. Community engagement, environmental impact assessments, and benefit-sharing mechanisms should be central to developing these green hydrogen SEZs. To ensure inclusive development, local employment and upskilling opportunities must be woven into the planning fabric.

The first policy milestone should be a national green hydrogen strategy. It must outline production targets, permissible technologies, financial instruments, and market development plans. The government should invest in grid upgrades to reduce NPMV in the short term and ensure that surplus energy can be redirected to hydrogen production. A hydrogen certification scheme, aligned with international standards, would be essential to ensure export readiness. Simultaneously, partnerships with China, Germany and the Gulf States could bring technical expertise and capital.

The government should also consider mandating hydrogen blending in existing CNG infrastructure or creating a fixed share of hydrogen procurement in fertilizer manufacturing. These demand-side measures will complement the supply-side investments and help establish a robust domestic market.

Importantly, green hydrogen presents an emerging opportunity in the global carbon market. High-quality carbon credits generated from low-emission hydrogen projects can attract private capital, especially in developing countries like Pakistan, where compliance carbon pricing mechanisms are limited. According to the IEA and GenZero, carbon credits could be pivotal in bridging the green premium of early-stage technologies like green hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel, and direct air capture.

Given that global investment in these three technologies was just $9 billion in 2023 but needs to grow to $700 billion annually by 2050, leveraging carbon credits can be vital to unlock climate finance. For Pakistan, integrating green hydrogen projects into the voluntary or compliance carbon markets -- once robust methodologies are adopted -- could open a new revenue stream while strengthening its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). With the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) and other global bodies now enforcing stricter rules, projects based on verifiable hydrogen use in industrial decarbonisation can credibly claim carbon reductions, enhancing Pakistan’s appeal in global carbon trading.

Ultimately, the sector-coupling model anchored in Thatta can help Pakistan kill two birds with one wind turbine. It offers a structural solution to the NPMV crisis and creates a new export industry aligned with global decarbonisation trends. It could become a template for other regions, such as Gwadar or coastal Balochistan, where solar and wind potentials are similarly underutilised.

What Thatta offers is a window into a future where clean energy isn’t just a moral imperative or a climate commitment but an economic growth strategy. This shift is not optional for a country like Pakistan; it is existential. The winds of Thatta are already blowing.

В Госдуме предлагают нивелировать связанные с этим риски для отрасли производством российского низкоуглеродного топлива

Возможные риски в связи с началом вступления в действие обязательных требований Международной организации гражданской авиации (ICAO, ИКАО) о сокращении авиационных выбросов углекислого газа (CO2) с 2027 года обозначил правительству замглавы комитета Госдумы по энергетике Юрий Станкевич. В конце марта он обратился с этим вопросом в Минэнерго, Минтранс, Минпромторг и Минэкономразвития, следует из соответствующих писем в ведомства (РБК ознакомился с документами).

Речь идет об учрежденной в 2016 году в рамках ICAO, членом которой является Россия, Схеме компенсации и сокращения выбросов углерода (система CORSIA) в международной гражданской авиации. Это свод глобальных рыночных мер, направленных на достижение целей по повышению топливной эффективности на 2% в период до 2050 года и стабилизации уровня выбросов СО2 с 2020 года. С 2021 года ее применение является добровольным, но с 2027 года будет обязательным.

Согласно резолюции ICAO А41-22, схема предполагает, что за выбросы углекислого газа, превышающие базовый уровень (85% от показателя 2019 года), авиакомпании будут платить. Как указано в документах (депутат подтвердил их подлинность и факт обращения в министерства), возникающие таким образом дополнительные издержки создают риски для авиакомпаний России и снижают конкурентоспособность производства и поставок авиатоплива, которое предлагают российские нефтяники.

«Дополнительные затраты авиакомпаний могут быть переложены на пассажиров в виде повышения цен на билеты. Кроме того, это может вызвать рост цен на авиагрузоперевозки, что особенно затронет срочные грузы, такие как фармацевтика и скоропортящиеся продукты, а также вызовет увеличение нагрузки на другие виды транспорта», — пишет Станкевич.

По его мнению, решением может стать запуск в России промышленного производства низкоуглеродного или устойчивого авиатоплива — LCAF или SAF. Однако сейчас его верификацией занимаются только компании из недружественных государств — Швейцарии, Германии, Японии. Поэтому, заключает депутат, необходимо «обеспечить условия», при которых способность российского низкоуглеродного авиатоплива сокращать углеродный след была бы признана ICAO.

Производство «зеленого» авиатоплива

CORSIA предусматривает производство LCAF на существующей инфраструктуре нефтеперерабатывающих заводов, следует из ответа замглавы Минэнерго Павла Сорокина на запрос депутата. В то же время проводимая в России модернизация нефтеперерабатывающих заводов направлена на выпуск топлива высокого качества с низким углеродным следом, в том числе и авиационного керосина («Джет А-1», ТС-1, РТ), потенциально отвечающего критериям LCAF. Однако «нефтяные компании сообщили, что в настоящее время в Российской Федерации отсутствует единая методика расчета выбросов и нормативов выбросов парниковых газов при производстве LCAF». «Только после разработки такой методики Минэкономразвития России появится точная информация о возможности производства или необходимости внедрения дополнительных мероприятий для производства LCAF», — пишет замминистра.

Что касается вопросов производства в России топлива SAF и связанного с этим регулирования, то они относятся к компетенции Минпромторга, курирующего химические и биохимические предприятия, отмечает Сорокин. Вместе с тем, указывает он, определенная работа по стандартизации в данном направлении все же ведется. Она предусматривает разработку предварительного национального стандарта (ПНСТ) «Топлива для реактивных двигателей. Компонент, обеспечивающий соответствие принципам устойчивого развития. Технические условия». Кроме того, в настоящее время Росстандартом рассматривается вопрос верификации низкоуглеродного авиационного топлива.

РБК обратился за комментарием в пресс-службы Минпромторга, Минэкономразвития и Минтранса, где все вопросы переадресовали в Министерство энергетики. В Минэнерго на момент публикации не ответили. РБК также направил запрос в крупнейшие нефтяные и авиакомпании.

Согласно ответу замглавы Минтранса Владимира Потешкина на письмо Станкевича, в настоящее время подведомственное министерству ФГУП ГосНИИ ГА совместно с нефтяниками ведет научно-исследовательскую работу по оценке возможности применения в составе отечественного топлива для реактивных двигателей компонентов, снижающих углеродный след (смесь с SAF). «Полученные предварительные результаты исследований свидетельствуют об отсутствии негативного влияния компонентов на качество», — указывает замминистра.

В 2021 году сообщалось о создании в России биотопливного альянса («Евразийский SAF-альянс») компаниями «Газпром нефть», Airbus, «Аэрофлот», S7 Group, «Волга-Днепр», а также Институтом им. Н.Е. Жуковского и ГосНИИ ГА. В рамках него планировалось объединить экспертизу, чтобы ускорить процесс сертификации экологически чистого авиационного топлива (SAF) и способствовать его развитию в России. Первый полет на смеси такого биотоплива в российской гражданской авиации должен был произойти не позднее 2024 года. Как сообщили РБК в пресс-службе «Газпром нефти», компания в настоящий момент ведет разработку рецептуры собственного авиационного топлива SAF. Его основу составит переработанное масложировое сырье. «Эта технология ранее была успешно протестирована при производстве судового биотоплива, заправку которым «Газпром нефть» уже осуществляет в российских портах», — рассказали в компании.

Сертификация российского топлива в ICAO

Однако в рамках CORSIA использовать топливо LCAF возможно только при условии сертификации производителя одной из утвержденных ICAO систем сертификации устойчивости, отмечает Сорокин. Сейчас к ним относятся только две организации: International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) и Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), но в их полномочия входит сертификация только производителей топлива SAF. «Таким образом, ввиду отсутствия утвержденных ИКАО органов сертификации, уполномоченных сертифицировать производителей LCAF, сертификация LCAF в рамках CORSIA невозможна и является барьером для развития этого рынка», — пишет он.

По данным на апрель 2024 года, сертификацию этих систем получили девять партий топлива, произведенных тремя компаниями: Ecochem (Китай), Neste (Нидерланды) и World Energy (США). Чтобы в этом ряду появилось российское топливо и система сертификации, Минтранс предлагает работу по трем направлениям, следует из письма Потешкина.

В госрегулировании:

создать орган, наделенный полномочиями по выработке государственной политики и ее реализации в области декарбонизации авиационного топлива;

создать национальную систему сертификации авиатоплива LCAF и SAF с учетом требований ICAO;

Информировать ICAO о проведенной работе для дальнейшего одобрения национальных сертификатов SAF и LCAF.

В техрегулировании:

внести изменения в соответствующий техрегламент Таможенного союза;

разработать национальный стандарт на топливо для реактивных двигателей, содержащее синтезированные углеводороды.

В производстве:

разработать российские технологии производства авиатоплива LCAF, а также синтезированных углеводородов для топлива SAF;

провести комплексные исследования опытно-промышленных партий топлива SAF с привлечением профильных научно-исследовательских институтов для подтверждения соответствия качества и эксплуатационных свойств такого топлива требованиям по стандартизации и обеспечению норм летной годности;

При положительных результатах испытаний организовать промышленное производство SAF.

Сокращение выбросов в условиях санкций

Поскольку около 20% глобального предложения авиакеросина соответствует критериям LCAF, только его масштабное применение могло бы обеспечить достижение цели ICAO по сокращению нетто-эмиссии за счет альтернативного топлива на 5% к 2030 году, считает Иван Рубанов, заместитель начальника управления углеродного рынка и инновационных проектов Петербургской биржи. Это быстро, требует малых усилий и организационных затрат с минимальными инвестициями в основные фонды. «Суммарные затраты на запуск масштабного производства SAF оцениваются в несколько триллионов долларов. Сам этот инструмент оказывается едва ли не самым дорогим способом декарбонизации», — пишет Рубанов в Биржевом вестнике Петербургской биржи.

Он считает, что потенциал потребления LCAF на российском рынке велик и в перспективе может сравниться со всем объемом использования авиатоплива в международных перевозках — около 5 млн т в год. Это обеспечило бы десятипроцентное снижение эмиссии, при этом часть топлива могла бы продаваться судам иностранных авиакомпаний, заправляющихся в России. «С точки зрения предложения критериям LCAF системы CORSIA могут соответствовать 10–30% производимого в стране авиакеросина, которые способны покрыть 50–100% потребностей международных авиаперевозчиков», — резюмирует Рубанов. А механизмом, который мог бы стимулировать спрос российских компаний на LCAF, могло бы стать использование различных коэффициентов при расчете демпферных платежей для LCAF и стандартного авиатоплива.

Вместе с тем в 2022 году Россия заявила, что не считает себя связанной положениями резолюции Ассамблеи ICAO А41-22, которая касается критериев оценки единиц выбросов для системы CORSIA. Представители российской делегации сообщили, что «в условиях беспрецедентных односторонних ограничений в отношении международной гражданской авиации, введенных рядом государств — членов ИКАО, любые меры по компенсации для международной гражданской авиации теряют всякий смысл».

«С учетом всех изменений и присоединения к утверждению системы CORSIA, которое было уже слишком давно, мое мнение — России нужно выйти из данного соглашения. Учитывая, какое у нас сейчас взаимодействие с Европой, как ограничены полеты, для нас теряется в этом смысл. А с точки зрения всех остальных дружественных государств, я думаю, что можно договариваться», — считает зампредседателя наблюдательного совета ассоциации «Надежный партнер» Дмитрий Гусев. Однако пока формального отказа нет, требования должны соблюдаться, и руководствоваться в этом нужно экономической целесообразностью и минимальными для эксплуатантов рисками, добавляет эксперт. «У нас много нефти, из которой мы можем сделать любое топливо, и огромные территории с несравнимым потенциалом поглощения углерода», — отмечает он.

Гендиректор Friendly Avia Support Олександр Ланецкий говорит, что игнорировать новые требования ICAO нельзя, так как они распространяются на авиакомпании всех стран. «Отказаться от выплат можно будет только в том случае, если кто-то из стран-участниц выйдет из соглашений ICAO. Тогда сломается вся система, потому что авиакомпании этой страны получат неконкурентное преимущество», — полагает эксперт. По его словам, в 2024 году авиакомпания Air Baltic, которая эксплуатирует современные самолеты Airbus A220-300 (в парке авиакомпании 50 таких судов) с высокой топливной эффективностью, направляла на покупку квот на выбросы CO2 около 3% своих расходов. Самолеты предыдущих поколений с меньшей топливной эффективностью, которые составляют основу парка российских перевозчиков, будут генерировать больше CO2. Соответственно, расходы российских компаний будут выше. Он добавил, что эксплуатанты переложат их в цены авиабилетов, потому что альтернативных источников компенсации роста себестоимости перевозок у них нет.",https://s0.rbk.ru/v6_top_pics/media/img/8/35/347463924885358.jpg,N,,2025-05-04 17:56:29.577470

A traveler books a long-haul flight from Frankfurt to Singapore and notices a line item labeled “Environmental Surcharge.” It’s not optional, and it’s not tiny. For most economy passengers, it adds somewhere between €6 and €20. In business class, it can go much higher. At first glance, this might seem like a minor annoyance—another in a growing list of airline fees. But that small surcharge is the tip of a much larger shift: the full cost of aviation decarbonization is beginning to land squarely with the customer.

Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is the aviation industry’s primary tool to cut lifecycle carbon emissions without fundamentally changing the airframes or propulsion systems that have defined commercial flight for decades. SAF can, in theory, slash emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional Jet A fuel. In practice, its contribution is far smaller today—less than 1% of global jet fuel use—but that share is growing rapidly, driven by policy mandates in the EU, UK, and Singapore, and increasingly by corporate net-zero travel programs. The catch is cost. SAF, whether derived from used cooking oil, forestry residues, or purpose-grown biomass, typically costs two to five times as much as fossil jet fuel. Synthetic e-fuels derived from green hydrogen are even more expensive—often eight to ten times—and face enormous scaling barriers.

According to the International Energy Agency, global SAF production was approximately 600 million liters in 2023, a twelvefold increase over 2019 levels but still a fraction of what is needed. The IEA projects that to meet net-zero aviation pathways, SAF will need to account for at least 10% of global jet fuel consumption by 2030, rising steeply thereafter. The EU’s Fit for 55 package mandates 2% SAF in 2025, 6% by 2030, and 20% by 2035 for all flights departing EU airports. Singapore will require 1% from 2026, scaling to 3–5% by 2030, and is introducing a SAF levy on tickets to fund that mandate. Airlines aren’t absorbing those costs; they’re passing them through.

This is something that’s built into my projection of aviation demand and decarbonization through 2100. Airlines aren’t charities and climate change is real, so the industry is going to have to pay for low-carbon power, and what costs there are will be born by passengers. Most projections ignore electric aviation, but I’ve discussed this with top people at Ryanair, aerospace engineers and electric aviation founders globally. We all agree that hybrid electric aviation for up to 1,000 km routes with 100 passengers is inevitable, and that will cut a lot of flights out of the jet fuel demand equation. Further, increased flight costs will significantly soften the demand increases seen from 1980 to 2019. COVID itself fundamentally altered the industry, with significantly less business travel in the Age of Zoom. Now there’s data on how airlines are already passing costs along.

This pass-through is happening in multiple ways. In Europe, full-service airlines like Lufthansa and Air France–KLM have implemented mandatory SAF surcharges that scale by route and class. Lufthansa’s fee can reach up to €72 for long-haul business class tickets. In Singapore, the government is levying a SAF charge directly on tickets. Finnair and United Airlines offer voluntary SAF contributions during booking, typically a few euros or dollars, framed as an easy climate action. Meanwhile, corporate travel programs have emerged as SAF buyers of last resort, with firms like Microsoft, Deloitte, and Boston Consulting Group paying premiums through programs like United’s Eco-Skies Alliance and Lufthansa’s Compensaid Corporate. These arrangements use book-and-claim accounting to decouple the physical fuel uplift from the emission reduction benefit, allowing companies to claim SAF-related reductions even if the fuel was burned elsewhere.

Yet the real story isn’t just how airlines are pricing SAF today. It’s how this dynamic reshapes aviation economics in the next decade. A 10% SAF blend, which may be mandatory in some jurisdictions by 2030, could increase total fuel costs by 20–30% if the price premium holds. That’s before factoring in airport blending logistics, certification costs, and potential penalties for non-compliance. Since jet fuel historically comprises 20–30% of airline operating expenses, this is a structural cost pressure that can’t be ignored. Airlines operate on thin margins. They will not, and cannot, absorb that burden alone. Ticket prices will rise.

The industry projects rising demand in spite of this, something I think is wishful thinking. Boeing and IATA forecast that global passenger traffic will double by 2040, citing long-term economic growth and expanding middle classes. But these projections rest on historical price elasticity that may no longer hold. Airfare inflation, driven by decarbonized fuel, is likely to cap growth earlier than IATA expects. Per analysis from Transport & Environment and others, a 20% rise in average ticket prices could reduce demand by 10-15% depending on the route and travel purpose. That would be enough to flatten growth curves, especially for discretionary leisure travel.

Moreover, decarbonization is not evenly distributed. Low-cost carriers with thinner customer margins and fewer business-class subsidies will face tougher choices. Ryanair has already warned that EU climate policies will raise average fares by €10 to €15 over the decade, and that’s with very low percentages of SAF. These aren’t abstract numbers. They will alter behavior. Short-haul trips under 1,000 kilometers may begin to shift to rail in Europe and East Asia, where infrastructure allows. Long-haul tourism may plateau as cost pressures mount. Business travel—already declining in relative terms since the pandemic—is unlikely to resume its former dominance, especially as virtual meetings and sustainability reporting norms take deeper hold.

As SAF mandates tighten, airlines will look for relief valves. Government subsidies, such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act’s $1.25–$1.75 per gallon tax credit for SAF, provide temporary cushioning, but that’s also not something that is guaranteed to persist given the current Administration’s wrecking ball approach. Those incentives phase out within the decade in any event, and few governments are eager to fund unlimited fuel subsidies for an industry still perceived as a luxury emitter. Some airlines are lobbying for contracts-for-difference or other hedge instruments to reduce price volatility. But even with policy support, costs will not return to fossil-era baselines.

One consequence will be fleet innovation. As SAF costs climb, the incentive to use less liquid fuel grows. Turboprop aircraft for short-haul regional routes are already 30–40% more fuel-efficient per passenger-kilometer than regional jets. Battery-electric and hybrid-electric turboprops are under development by firms like Heart Aerospace, Ampaire, and others, with 19 to 100 seat configurations and ranges from 200 to 1,000 kilometers. These aircraft avoid most SAF costs altogether. By 2035, they are likely to be competitive for short regional hops, especially in jurisdictions with high carbon prices or SAF mandates. Airports may also adjust, shifting infrastructure investments toward regional mobility rather than long-haul expansions.

As I’ve noted, our biological waste streams are immense, with 2.5 billion tons of food waste annually alone, and more from agricultural, animal husbandry and forestry. I’ve assessed virtually all of the feedstocks and processing technologies and am comfortable that there is zero conflict between climate goals, feeding people and biofuel use for longer haul aviation and shipping. Further, shifting those waste streams into biofuels is an inherent climate benefit because a lot of them decompose anaerobically into methane, leading to big climate challenges. That points to bioSAF as the dominant pathway, not because it’s perfect, but because it’s available, certifiable, and cheaper than synthetic options. Green hydrogen-derived e-kerosene remains and will remain prohibitively expensive and power-intensive. Blue hydrogen, produced from fossil methane with carbon capture, being used for synthetic fuels will likely never reach the economic, regulatory or public acceptance thresholds needed for mass adoption in aviation.

We are seeing the start of the repricing of the sky. SAF is not a footnote—it is the future of aviation fuel, and it’s not and will not be cheap. Every surcharge and fare increase is a signal. As SAF blends rise from 1% today to 10% and eventually 20% by 2035, ticket prices will climb. Some travelers will fly less. Some routes will shrink. Short-haul aviation will start shifting to electric propulsion. The net result isn’t the end of flying, but a subtle inversion of the curve: fewer people flying more carefully, on planes that burn fewer liquids and more electrons, with costs and choices reshaped by carbon. The sooner we acknowledge this trajectory, the better we can navigate it.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ChatGPT-Image-May-4-2025-09_46_34-AM-800x424.png,N,,2025-05-04 14:56:07.518303

The United States is facing a significant downturn in international tourism in 2025, with projections indicating a 5.1 percent drop in the number of travelers coming to the country. This marks a stark reversal from the previously anticipated growth rate of 8.8 percent. The impact extends beyond just the number of visitors; foreign visitor spending is expected to plummet by 10.9 percent, deepening the economic strain on the tourism sector.

This unexpected decline in international arrivals and spending is expected to have wide-ranging effects on industries dependent on tourism, from hospitality and retail to transportation and local businesses. While the U.S. had been preparing for a steady recovery following the pandemic, this sharp drop underscores the fragility of global travel in the face of shifting geopolitical and economic factors.

With a standout fourteen percent increase in international passengers, the airline has successfully capitalized on the growing demand from key US markets. This growth, fueled by a recovery in global travel and the airline’s expanding routes, highlights Japan Airlines’ ability to attract both inbound tourism and outbound business travel, positioning the airline for continued success in the highly competitive aviation industry.

Japan Airlines (JL) has announced outstanding financial results for fiscal year 2024-2025, driven by a strong 14% surge in international passenger traffic and strategic growth initiatives. The airline’s performance is also bolstered by substantial progress in its low-cost carrier (LCC) operations, full-service segments, and non-aviation business areas, as well as its sustainability efforts such as the adoption of domestic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Japan Airlines’ Revenue Growth and Passenger Increase

For the fiscal year 2024-2025, Japan Airlines posted consolidated revenues of JPY 1,844 billion, marking a significant 11.6% year-on-year increase. This performance is the highest since the airline’s re-listing. The growth in revenues was primarily driven by a 14.4% increase in international passenger numbers, alongside steady increases in domestic travel, cargo operations, and other non-aviation business segments.

The airline’s operating expenses also saw a rise, climbing by 9.8% year-on-year to JPY 1,693.4 billion. This increase was largely influenced by the depreciation of the Japanese yen, higher fuel costs, and strategic investments in workforce expansion. However, despite these increased costs, Japan Airlines reported impressive profit growth. EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) rose by 18.7%, totaling JPY 172.4 billion, while net profit grew by 12.0%, reaching JPY 107.0 billion.

Robust International Passenger Demand

One of the key contributors to Japan Airlines’ growth was the sharp increase in international passenger demand. With international travel rebounding after pandemic-related slowdowns, the airline saw a 14.4% growth in international passengers. This increase was driven by a combination of recovering outbound business travel and rising inbound tourism to Japan. High-demand routes such as Tokyo-Narita (NRT) to Chicago (ORD) and expanded services from Osaka-Kansai (KIX) contributed significantly to this surge.

In addition, the airline capitalized on the revival of global tourism and business travel, with Southeast Asia, North America, and intra-Asia routes experiencing notable growth. The airline saw an 11.9% rise in international revenue as a result of these trends, solidifying its position as a key player in the global aviation market.

Operational Performance and Highlights

Japan Airlines’ full-service operations continued to show strong performance, contributing significantly to the company’s growth. Revenue from its full-service segment climbed by 9.8%, totaling JPY 1,451.8 billion. This growth was driven by sustained demand from inbound tourism, recovering business travel, and strong demand for high-value cargo. Operating profit (EBIT) from the full-service operations rose by 4.7%, reaching JPY 111.1 billion.

In the domestic market, Japan Airlines also saw continued growth in passenger demand. Domestic passenger numbers rose by 2.9% for the full year, with domestic revenue increasing by 3.7%. One of the highlights in the domestic market was the airline’s record-high load factor of 82.9% in the fourth quarter, which was bolstered by promotional campaigns and strong demand.

Strategic Expansion and Fleet Growth

Looking forward, Japan Airlines is actively expanding its network and fleet to accommodate increasing passenger demand. The airline plans to begin new direct flights between Tokyo-Narita (NRT) and Chicago (ORD) starting May 31, 2025. In addition, it will increase flight frequencies on its Honolulu routes from Osaka (KIX) and Nagoya (NGO) by July.

To further enhance its long-term growth, Japan Airlines plans to expand its fleet by adding ten Boeing 787-9s and twenty Airbus A350-900s from FY2027 onwards. These new aircraft will allow Japan Airlines to increase its seat capacity and enhance service offerings for both domestic and international routes.

Additionally, Japan Airlines has launched the “DEEEEP JAPAN” project in collaboration with the travel agency JTB, with the goal of promoting regional tourism across Japan. Starting from FY2028, Japan Airlines will begin replacing its Boeing 767 aircraft with more fuel-efficient Airbus A321neo models, initially for Tokyo-Haneda (HND) routes.

Financial Outlook and Future Projections

Japan Airlines’ solid financial performance has resulted in a boost to its annual dividend, which has been increased from JPY 80 to JPY 86 per share. Additionally, the year-end dividend has risen from JPY 40 to JPY 46. This reflects the airline’s strong earnings and its commitment to delivering value to shareholders.

For the fiscal year 2025-2026, Japan Airlines expects to maintain its positive momentum. The airline is forecasting total revenues of JPY 1,977.0 billion, with EBIT reaching JPY 200.0 billion and net profit growing to JPY 115.0 billion. The company attributes this optimistic forecast to continued demand for air travel, coupled with the airline’s ongoing strategic fleet and network expansions.

Japan Airlines has seen an impressive fourteen percent increase in international passenger traffic for fiscal year 2024-25, driven by strong demand from US markets. This growth underscores the airline’s expanding global presence and recovery in both inbound and outbound travel.

In conclusion, Japan Airlines’ record financial results for FY2024-2025 are a testament to its successful recovery following the pandemic. With growing passenger numbers, operational efficiencies, and strategic investments in fleet and network expansions, Japan Airlines is well-positioned for continued growth in the coming years.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/freepik__the-style-is-candid-ima-2025-05-04T110242540.jpg,N,,2025-05-04 02:56:24.981928

As News.com.au reported, the minority stakeholder in the Utah Jazz bought a Bombardier 7500 capable of carrying up to 19 passengers and said he has ""a deep internal conflict"" about it. He cited personal security, running a global business from Australia, and fatherhood in a LinkedIn post as reasons for using the carbon-heavy mode of transport.

Why is it an issue when many other billionaires utilize large vessels such as private jets and yachts? For one, the amount of polluting gases regular private jet travel produces goes against Cannon-Brookes' stance on environmental issues.

He has been an active climate campaigner and is a key investor in SunCable's giant Australia-Asia PowerLink — a project to transport energy from solar farms in the Northern Territory to Singapore.

Per the Financial Post, his investment firm, Grok Ventures, attempted a 2022 takeover of Australia's AGL Energy to help the country transition from coal to more sustainable energy. The Financial Review reported that his influence and shares in the company encouraged AGL to close the country's biggest coal plant a decade ahead of schedule.

Carbon gases not only cause air pollution but are a major factor in the overheating planet and the unpredictable weather patterns that come with it. While these jets make up only a fraction of those gases — almost 2% of the industry's overall pollution — the figure is steadily increasing. The journal Communications Earth & Environment published a study in 2024 that said the polluting gases from private jets had increased by 46% over the past five years.

Some effort is being made to mitigate a portion of those toxins. VistaJet, a leader in private business aviation, is using biogenic sustainable aviation fuel created from used cooking oil. Others, including Flexjet, also use carbon offset programs — projects that reduce or remove pollution elsewhere to compensate for what flights produce.

How or if Cannon-Brookes will offset his private travel remains to be seen. Based on carbon footprint, a greener option may have been the low fuel-consuming Pilatus PC-12, a single-engine jet that's 10 times less polluting than a Bombardier Global 6000, per Aeroaffaires. At least the Bombardier 7500 has its pros, as ""approximately 85% of the materials used are recoverable,"" according to Runway Girl Network.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Mike-Cannon-Brookesimage-recxlAf0NNgIWZTp0.jpg,N,,2025-05-03 23:56:07.565943

With birth rates plummeting globally, countries face a future of shrinking and ageing societies driven by an unrelenting collapse in fertility.

Family structures and living arrangements previously imaged only in science fiction will become commonplace features of everyday life with an unprecedented collapse of procreative power.

These stark warnings of an era of pervasive depopulation were delivered at the 2025 Congress of the Asia Pacific Initiative on Reproduction (ASPIRE) in Singapore today.

Internationally respected political economist, Dr Nicholas Eberstadt, is supporting an ASPIRE campaign advocating for policy changes that will encourage family building, particularly in the Asia Pacific region.

Dr Eberstadt is the Henry Wendt Chair in Political Economy at the American Enterprise Institute where he is renowned for his demographic research and studies on international security. He is also a senior advisor to the National Bureau of Asian Research.

He told the ASPIRE Congress that between 1965 and 2015 the human fertility rate in births per woman fell by half and the “record breaking, jaw dropping” plunge has quickened in recent years in rich and poor countries alike.

Dr Eberstadt said by 2023 fertility levels were 40 per cent below replacement levels in Japan, 50 per cent in mainland China, 60 per cent in Taiwan and 65 per cent in South Korea. Sub-replacement trends are also evident in countries including Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia.

“Labour forces will shrink all around the world due to the spread of sub-replacement birth rates with the old beginning to outnumber the young,” Dr Eberstadt explained.

“Societies will have to adjust their expectations to comport with the new realities of fewer workers, savers, taxpayers, renters, home buyers, entrepreneurs, innovators, inventors, consumers and voters.

“Dwindling workforces, reduced savings and investment, and unsustainable social outlays and budget deficits are all on the cards for today’s developed countries without sweeping changes in immigration, lifecycle earning and consumption patterns, and government policies for taxation and social expenditures.

“Super-elders of 80-plus years of age are the world’s fastest growing cohort. By 2050, there will be more of them than children in some countries. The burden of caring for people with dementia will pose growing costs – human, social, economic – in an aging and shrinking world.”

Dr Eberstadt said as families and societies assume new structures under long-term population decline, the challenge will be to develop new habits of mind, conventions and cooperative objectives.

“Policymakers will have to learn new rules for development in the midst of depopulation,” he explained. “Investors, likewise, will need new playbooks to profit from an altered environment of opportunity and risk.

“There will be less margin for error for investment projects, be they public or private, and no rising tide of demand from a growing pool of consumers or taxpayers to count on.

“Prosperity in a depopulating world will also depend on open economics, free trade in goods, services and finance to counter the constraints that shrinking populations impose. As the hunt for scarce talent becomes more acute, the movement of people will take on new economic salience and immigration will matter more than in does today.”

ASPIRE President, Dr Clare Boothroyd, said in response to the disturbing fall in fertility rates, a new ASPIRE special interest group would be created to harness expertise in population sustainability.

She will co-Chair the group with acclaimed reproductive endocrinologist, Professor Dominique de Ziegler from Foch Hospital in Paris.

“Humanity is entering uncharted territory in the phenomenon of depopulation, and it is a challenge that must be embraced by governments, industry, the education sector and the public to push for family friendly policies that encourage family planning,” Dr Boothroyd said.

The ASPIRE Congress at the Suntec Convention and Exhibition Centre in Singapore has attracted more than 2,000 leaders from various disciplines in assisted reproduction to address latest advances and knowledge in fertility health.

NetJets, Inc. includes management and charter operator Executive Jet Management.

Concluding Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, Warren Buffett said earlier today that he would recommend to the company’s board that Greg Abel assume his position as chief executive.

Abel is currently the vice chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy.

He has been tabbed as Buffett’s successor for some time.

Berkshire Hathaway bought NetJets in 1998 for $711 million.

Buffett’s entry into the business aviation segment is widely credited for encouraging investment in the sector.

Kenn Ricci, chairman of rival Flexjet, recently talked about Buffett’s impact during an NBAA podcast:

‘We estimated we needed about $60 million to $80 million for core fleet buying used aircraft. We went out to the banks with my great idea…and maybe we had $7 million, $10 million in debt available…Then, in 1998, Warren Buffett bought NetJets. And every bank I had been to thought I was a genius all of a sudden. And they were all looking to get into the industry and we had $500 million. In some way, but for Warren endorsing our industry, I never would have found the debt capital to be able to build the inventory and go as fast as I did.’

The high-visibility Berkshire Hathaway platform has also promoted private aviation to a wider audience of businesses and HNW consumers.

NetJets programmatic offerings—guaranteed jet cards and fractional ownership—fill the gap between ad hoc charters and full ownership, encouraging more consumers to enter the segment.

At the end of 2024, NetJets had 9,106 employees.

Buffett and Airlines

In 2017, amid another round of airline investments, Buffett told shareholders, “You couldn’t pick a tougher industry.”

He also reprised his famous 2007 quote, “If a far-sighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down.”

After his first airline investment in 1989, Buffett wrote, “In the case of our commitment to USAir, industry economics had soured before the ink dried on our check. As I’ve previously mentioned, it was I who happily jumped into the pool; no one pushed me. Yes, I knew the industry would be ruggedly competitive, but I did not expect its leaders to engage in prolonged kamikaze behavior. In the last two years, airline companies have acted as if they are member of a competitive tontine, which they wish to bring to its conclusion as rapidly as possible.”

Oxford defines a tontine as an annuity shared by subscribers to a loan or common fund, the shares increasing as subscribers die until the last survivor enjoys the whole income.

Buffett and NetJets

The private aviation business has proven to be as fierce and challenging to make a buck as the Part 121 airlines.

Berkshire Hathaway bought NetJets in 1998 for $711 million.

In 2010, Buffett wrote, “Even though NetJets was consistently a runaway winner with customers, our financial results, since its acquisition in 1998, were a failure.”

Buffett told shareholders that in his first 11 years of ownership, the private jet company incurred an aggregate pre-tax loss of $157 million.

Debt went from $102 million to $1.9 billion.

At the time, the legendary investor noted, “Without Berkshire’s guarantee of this debt, NetJets would have been out of business.”

In 2023, the late Charlie Munger told shareholders at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting, “NetJets has been remarkable. You can argue it’s worth as much as any airline now.”

American Airlines, the least valuable major airline at the time, was valued at around $9 billion.

For the industry’s dominant player, it put an exclamation point on what is one of aviation’s biggest turnarounds.

Last year, NetJets and its pilots agreed to a new contract.

It will grant cockpit crews an extra $1.6 billion in compensation over five years.

The move was viewed as an endorsement of NetJets and private aviation from America’s best-known and arguably most successful investor.

NetJets currently holds 2,000 options for new private jets from Bombardier, Embraer, and Textron Aviation.

This year’s Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting marked the second straight year that NetJets was not mentioned during the question-and-answer session.

NetJets Executive Moves

Last year, NetJets also quietly made an executive change, although it did not issue an external announcement.

Patrick Gallagher, NetJets’ President of Sales, Marketing, and Owner Services divisions, was named President of NetJets Aviation.

He now oversees the brand’s strategic direction, vision, and ongoing growth.

Before joining the company, Gallagher was Executive Vice President and Head of Sales at Marquis Jet Partners, joining NetJets when it bought the jet card group in 2010.
