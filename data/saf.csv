In July, SOHAR signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with HYNAT SA aimed at developing a comprehensive natural hydrogen value chain in Oman.
This cooperation focuses on identifying natural hydrogen production zones, establishing logistics corridors, and creating dedicated storage and processing infrastructure.
Despite this focus on white hydrogen, SOHAR remains committed to advancing green hydrogen initiatives.
Additionally, SOHAR has partnered with a Swiss consortium to explore establishing a green hydrogen corridor between Oman and Switzerland.","MUSCAT, NOV 30 — The recent discovery of naturally occurring hydrogen, also known as native or white hydrogen, in Suhar has bolstered prospects for its development as a key resource in advancing the decarbonisation objectives of SOHAR Port and Freezone, a senior official from the maritime hub stated.

Emile Hoogsteden, CEO of SOHAR, emphasized the port’s ongoing partnership with Swiss natural hydrogen specialist HYNAT SA to explore subsurface hydrogen reserves in the area. Unlike conventional hydrogen, white hydrogen is geologically formed and naturally present within the Earth’s crust, presenting an opportunity for direct extraction from underground reservoirs as a clean, low-carbon energy source.

“Reserves in this region have been confirmed,” Hoogsteden said. “The next step involves extraction testing to evaluate feasibility and energy yield. Should this prove viable, it could supply a direct, low-carbon fuel source to industries within SOHAR,” he added during an interview with The Energy Year, a UK-based business intelligence platform.

In July, SOHAR signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with HYNAT SA aimed at developing a comprehensive natural hydrogen value chain in Oman. This cooperation focuses on identifying natural hydrogen production zones, establishing logistics corridors, and creating dedicated storage and processing infrastructure. Earlier in February, the Ministry of Energy and Minerals had also signed an MoU granting HYNAT the rights to conduct feasibility studies.

Despite this focus on white hydrogen, SOHAR remains committed to advancing green hydrogen initiatives. Hoogsteden stated, “We are also pursuing green hydrogen development at SOHAR to further strengthen its position as a green manufacturing hub.”

Dr. Abdullah al Abri, Vice President — Sustainability at SOHAR, highlighted the port’s strong existing hydrogen demand, driven by its refinery, petrochemical, and DRI-based steel industries. He described SOHAR as a natural national hub for green hydrogen production. The strategic approach involves starting with small pilot projects to build expertise and confidence. Currently, an investment proposal is being finalized to install 80–100 MW of grid-connected electrolysers, providing a continuous hydrogen supply to port industries and mitigating the intermittency challenges associated with standalone renewable sources.

On The Energy Talks platform, Dr. Al Abri explained that this strategy minimizes investment risk by leveraging the existing grid, which is already about 11% renewable and expected to reach 30% by 2030. This setup allows for the use of renewable energy certificates and guarantees a reliable, uninterrupted hydrogen supply to end users.

Additionally, SOHAR has partnered with a Swiss consortium to explore establishing a green hydrogen corridor between Oman and Switzerland. This collaboration builds on a 2023 intergovernmental framework agreement to develop a joint implementation road map and related projects, reflecting both nations’ shared carbon neutrality goals.

Dr. Al Abri underscored hydrogen’s strategic significance for SOHAR. The port currently supports various industries and LNG bunkering operations, with plans to advance methanation as the next phase. As biofuel industries expand, their biogenic CO₂ emissions could be utilized to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other green fuels. This pathway aligns closely with SOHAR’s long-term decarbonisation strategy, in which hydrogen plays a central role.

Last week in Singapore business, the Ministry of Health is set to revamp Integrated Shield Plan riders from April 2026. Full-deductible coverage will be removed, and the annual co-payment cap will increase to at least $6,000, with premiums expected to fall by around 30%.

Economists expect Singapore’s economic growth to moderate in 2026 after a strong 2025 driven by AI-related demand, electronics exports, and a robust construction pipeline. The gross domestic product growth is forecast at 2.1–3%, with potential headwinds including slowing exports and ongoing trade risks such as US tariffs.

The economy is anticipated to normalise rather than face a sharp slowdown, supported by continued activity in finance, construction, and digital services.

Inflation is also projected to rise to around 1.5% in 2026, reflecting domestic cost adjustments and policy measures including the Sustainable Aviation Fuel levy, higher carbon taxes, and rising electricity tariffs. Core inflation is expected to mirror this pace, though offsets such as lower childcare fee caps may help moderate overall price pressures.

The housing market will also see change, as the supply of HDB flats reaching their minimum occupation period (MOP) is set to more than double from 2026. Newer flats may command higher rents, widening estate-level disparities, whilst rising numbers of Employment Pass and work-pass holders are expected to support demand for smaller units and room rentals.

Overall rental growth is forecast to remain moderate at 1% to 3%.

With operators projecting subdued revenue and profit growth alongside rising supply and softer trading metrics, Singapore’s hotel market is also set for a weaker 2025.

Meanwhile, the rollout of robotaxis in Singapore remains a long-term prospect. Widespread adoption is unlikely within the next five years due to public trust issues, regulatory hurdles, technical limitations, and unresolved liability concerns.

Early deployments are expected in controlled environments such as university campuses, industrial parks, and last-mile shuttle routes, with longer-term opportunities in autonomous software, system development, and complementary transport services.

Supporting small businesses, CIMB Singapore has launched the CIMB Founders Card, offering sole proprietors and entrepreneurs easier access to working-capital funding.

The card provides flexible documentation, extended interest-free periods of up to 114 days, and business-friendly perks such as airport lounge access, travel insurance, and discounts on co-working spaces. Early users report that it helps manage seasonal expenses, inventory, and growth initiatives.

In media and entertainment, StarHub and Mediacorp are merging platforms to simplify TV navigation and strengthen local broadcasters against global streaming rivals. The unified system will provide easier access to premium content, including the Premier League and thousands of hours of live sports and Asian programming, whilst also enhancing audience tracking and advertising effectiveness over the coming year.

Singapore has claimed the top spot in the 2025 Global Talent Competitiveness Index, overtaking Switzerland. The city-state ranks first globally for formal education, regulatory environment, and generalist adaptive skills, while improvements in talent retention have further boosted its standing.

Leadership stability in Singapore is reflected in corporate governance, with listed-company CEOs holding the longest average tenure in Asia-Pacific at 8.8 years, well above the regional average of 5.9 years and the global average of 7.2 years.

Despite elevated CEO turnover across the region, most new appointments in Singapore are internal promotions and first-time CEOs, suggesting that boards are balancing stability with transformation.",https://sbr.com.sg/s3/files/styles/opengraph/public/2025-11/pexels-realcereal-15480459.jpg?h=0072664d&itok=mET59PRp,N,,2025-11-30 18:57:10.974306

Applicable Policy and Categorization. AIIB’s Environmental and Social Framework (ESF), including the Environment and Social Standards (ESSs) and the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL), will apply to this Project. ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) is applicable for assessment of environmental and social (ES) impacts of Project activities. ESS 2 (Involuntary Resettlement) may be triggered for access road works and the development of an associated high voltage distribution line (DL) that will be implemented prior to operations, but ESS 3 (Indigenous Peoples) is not expected to apply to this Project as neither the biorefinery nor pipelines are located in or near Indigenous Peoples’ land. The Project has been determined as Category A in accordance with the ESF. This assignation has been made considering the sensitive social context with low income communities present in proximity to the biorefinery and pipeline route; construction on contaminated land and elevated health risks to workers during construction; elevated reputational risks around feedstock supply chain including for Soybean Oil (SBO) and Used Cooking Oil (UCO); and the nature and scale of the biorefinery process and associated emissions and health, safety and emergency risks, alone and in-combination with the existing refinery complex and pipelines.

Environmental and Social Instruments. The Client has developed a suite of ES assessments and management plans for the biorefinery and pipelines under Brazilian legislation that are largely consistent with AIIB’s ESF. The pipelines and minor works at the port facility are addressed through the Environmental Impact Analysis Report: Application for Alteration License (LA) - Expansion of operations at the Madre de Deus Terminal (Transpetro, April 2025). The biorefinery works are covered by the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA): Renewable Fuels Production Plant, volumes 1-4 (Acelen, September 2025). A Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) has also been prepared for conformity with ESS1 and other key instruments are available including a quantitative risk assessment and health impact assessment and management plan for works on contaminated land. Additional assessment and management instruments are committed by the Client or in development to address outstanding gaps against the ESF. These include finalization of a critical habitat assessment (CHA) and ES management instruments for the TL. The Client is developing an Integrated Management System (IMS) for construction and operation based on an existing fully developed IMS for the Mataripe Refinery. This is considered compliant with ESS1 in relation to Environmental and Social Management Systems (ESMS) and the Client has strong institutional capacity to develop, implement and monitor management system performance.

Environmental Aspects. The HEFA facility will be implemented on brownfield land that will be decontaminated. The Client is identifying and managing risks in accordance with good international industry practice (GIIP). The HEFA plant will utilize contracted Soybean Oil (SBO), Used Cooking Oil (UCO) and is capable of processing other vegetable oils and tallow as feedstock. Soybean production has been linked to deforestation in Brazil. The importance of managing feedstock risks is recognized by the Client and reflected in a suite of mitigations. Biodiversity risks have been considered and impacts on critical habitat are not presently anticipated. The HEFA plant and pipelines are located within areas of natural (although heavily anthropized) habitat and will result in the loss of ~1,500 trees. The Client is committed to achieving no net loss in accordance with ESS1. Assessment of biodiversity risk associated with the high voltage distribution line is committed. During operation, the HEFA plant will emit pollutants including carbon oxides nitrogen (NOX and NO2) and sulfur oxides (SOX and SO2) from across three stacks. Pollution abatement technologies are included in the design, and the Client is committed to achieving GIIP for emissions to air as per the World Bank Group EHS Guidelines for Oleochemical Manufacturing. The change in local air quality as a result of biorefinery emissions in combination with emissions from the existing refinery are small and not significant for human health. Additional potential environmental risks from HEFA plant construction and operations include water consumption and water discharge, energy consumption, waste management, noise emissions, hazardous materials management and risks of pollution incidents. The Client has developed outline management plans aligned with GIIP for managing these risks that will be further elaborated as the project approaches construction and then operations.

Social and Gender Aspects. The Project is expected to deliver substantial social benefits, including employment generation, local economic development, contributions to Brazil’s energy transition, and the enhancement of technical expertise in the production of SAF and RD. There is no need for land acquisition and no legacy issues related to land acquisition or resettlement for the biorefinery or the associated pipeline, which will be constructed within an existing RoW. It is possible that small areas of land may be required for access roads and the DL but this is not yet confirmed. A Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (LARF) consistent with ESS 2 is committed in case this issue is realized. The Project will not be implemented on Indigenous Peoples’ lands. Other relevant social risks include community health and safety impacts from construction activities, potential tensions related to security personnel, risks of sexual harassment and exploitation (SH&E), and the influx of non-local workers. Safeguards to mitigate these risks in relation to labor rights, gender-based violence, and worker protection are included for in Brazilian law or otherwise committed by the Client. In addition, the Project presents opportunities to advance gender equality in line with Brazil’s National Policy for Women and Bahia State’s policies on gender inclusion and equity. Gender-related risks include heightened risks of GBV, sexual harassment, and exploitation, particularly linked to the potential influx of non-local workers. The Client is committed to further assessing GBV risks and adopting GIIP for managing all gender issues.

Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), Labor and Employment Conditions. The Project will involve typical construction-related OHS risks for workers, including collisions with moving machinery and vehicles, hazards associated with non-iodizing radiation, hazardous chemicals, electric shocks, working at height, confined spaces, hot works, mechanical and load-handling risks, and exposure to noise, dust, heat and vapors etc. These risks will be addressed through a comprehensive Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Program included in the Client’s Integrated Management System. In addition, Brazil has federal and state labor legislation, including requirements under the “Consolidação das Leis do Trabalho” (CLT) and “Normas Regulamentadoras” (NRs), which establish mandatory protections for workers health, safety, and fair labor conditions. In Bahia, these requirements are reinforced through the “Agenda Bahia do Trabalho Decente”, which promotes compliance with labor rights, gender equality, and safe working environments.

Stakeholder Engagement and Information Disclosure. An SEP has been prepared and meaningful consultations on the Project were carried out in eight directly impacted communities as part of the national permitting process. In line with the SEP, stakeholder engagement will continue throughout the Project cycle to ensure transparent communication and responsiveness to community concerns. In accordance with Brazilian law, the environmental assessment and management documentation prepared to obtain the permits for the biorefinery and pipelines were published on the website of the Environment and Water Resources Institute (“Instituto do Meio Ambiente e Recursos Hídricos” -INEMA) as part of the consultation process. The pipeline LA, biorefinery EIA and a non-technical summary (in English and Portuguese), and the Project SEP were subsequently disclosed on the Acelen Renewables’ website on 29 November 2025 at: https://www.acelenrenovaveis.com.br/biorrefinaria-adicionais/.

Airlines took a hit during the pandemic, as did so many global industries. But in 2024, annual air travel returned to pre-pandemic levels and according to Bain & Company’s July 2025 report Air Travel Forecast to 2040: Geopolitics and the Carbon Challenge, the long-term outlook for air travel is expected to remain stable. The management consultancy expects global revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) to reach 14.8 trillion by 2040 or 178 percent of 2019 volume. This demand will be driven by both mature and emerging markets. The International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) February 2025 report Air Passenger Demand Forecasting: The Future of Global Air Travel (2024 to 2044) expects demand to be driven by both mature markets like Europe where the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of annual passenger traffic is expected to be 2.5 percent and emerging markets such as Asia-Pacific where CAGR is slated to hit 5.1 percent through 2043.

But there are headwinds as far as the industry’s ability to scale up and meet this increased demand. The first issue is aircraft supply, which isn’t keeping up with demand due to issues with aerospace supply chains and skilled labor shortages. McKinsey & Company points out in its February 2025 report How Severe Is the Aircraft Shortage and What Happens Next? that airlines are keeping older aircraft in service longer.

The other pressing issue? Sustainability.

Mandated Sustainability

“It’s not just an environmental imperative, it’s actually an economic survival strategy,” said Pedro de la Fuente, IATA’s senior manager, sustainability, The Americas. “From an industry standpoint, we need to ensure that we reduce lifecycle emissions in a way that will help aviation maintain a license to operate as we see more governments tightening climate regulations.”

Governments around the globe began implementing regulations following the signing of the Paris Agreement at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference. Nearly 200 countries signed a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), outlining their plans to reduce carbon emissions in order to reach the agreement's goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels so emissions can reach net zero by 2050. This has since led to various net zero coalitions such as the UN-backed Race to Zero, which has been signed by thousands of companies, cities and educational institutions.

Alternative Aircraft

One way of addressing sustainability issues and the scarcity of new aircraft is by looking to electric, hydrogen-powered and hybrid aircraft. While these technologies are still in development and show some promise, de la Fuente noted that they also face an uncertain future due to scalability and adoption. “We don’t have the capacity today to charge an aircraft at a speed that allows for a quick turnaround flight, nor do we have the capacity to supply green hydrogen in our airport fuel supply,” he said.

Nevertheless, these alternatively-powered aircraft are expected to have a place in the broader aviation landscape. Medical supply delivery, passenger transport and natural disaster response in remote locations can all benefit from the efficiency of global Advanced Air Mobility, which the World Economic Forum makes a case for in its 2024 whitepaper Advanced Air Mobility: Shaping the Future of Aviation. This new air transportation system deploys automated aircraft including drones and Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) air taxis that are electric and sustainable. They also have the ability to shuttle passengers between urban and suburban locations as well as potentially offer more regional transit.

Aviation’s Reduction Efforts

After the Paris Agreement took effect, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) launched the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) in 2016. Now voluntary, this program will become mandatory for all international airlines in 2027. Intended to control carbon emissions from international flights as demand increases, CORSIA requires airlines to purchase sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) or carbon offset credits. This is no small commitment.

The carbon emissions produced by the aviation industry have garnered particular attention. In September, World Travel & Tourism Council President Gloria Guevara said that transport accounts for 40 percent of the travel industry’s emissions. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), carbon emissions from aviation grew faster than rail, road or shipping between 2000 and 2019. By 2023, the IEA put aviation-produced carbon emissions at 90 percent of their pre-Covid peak.

The Carbon Offset Market

One approach to reaching net zero is the purchase of carbon offset credits or certificates. Organizations like Sustainable Travel International (STI) give both businesses, individuals and even destinations the ability to do this. The organization’s website features a calculator that can be used to measure the total carbon footprint of any given trip, including corporate travel, or business operation such as an event and then purchase an equivalent number of credits to mitigate that footprint. Credits go towards a variety of projects that ultimately provide a balance to the amount of carbon we produce. This includes reforestation, marshland and mangrove preservation, clean energy production and new climate technology.

STI’s CEO Paloma Zapata encourages travel for the experience to connect with other people and experience different cultures. She also adds “it’s important for people to be aware of the transition away from fossil fuels and to support it so that in the future, it’s not ‘sustainable travel,’ but simply how we travel.”

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Among the new climate tech that credits can support is sustainable aviation fuel or SAF. Unlike fossil-derived fuel, SAF is comprised of renewable or even waste products such as cooking oil, agricultural waste or captured carbon dioxide combined with hydrogen produced by solar or wind-generated electricity. SAF is purposefully designed for today’s commercial aircraft, but both expensive and limited in availability. According to the IATA roadmap, sustainable aviation fuel can represent up to 65% of the emissions reductions that the industry can achieve by 2050. “The scalability of where we are today in 2025 is mainly driven by SAF and addressing any residual emissions with carbon offsets to compensate,” said de la Fuente.

Scaling SAF production requires a greater volume of the materials used to produce it as well as greater development of and investment in the advanced technologies needed to scale up. Governmental support can accelerate SAF production at scale, but political involvement is largely limited to emissions regulations and in some cases, imposing relatively new taxes on a business’ carbon emissions.

To counter this, the aviation industry has turned to SAF certificates. Somewhat similar to purchasing carbon offset credits, SAF certificates directly and exclusively fund SAF production and the technologies and materials needed to produce it at scale. The Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) is a prominent organization selling SAF certificates. “We’re focused on keeping the investment in the value chain, so SAF certificate investment goes directly to SAF production facilities and more importantly, it promotes technology change,” says Andre de Fontaine, managing director at the Center for Green Market Activation, which serves as SABA’s Secretariat. “Investment in SAF certificates creates a new revenue stream for these fuel producers to scale production.”

A Challenging Regulatory Environment

While SAF certificates are certainly beneficial, they simply aren’t enough. Some airlines give travelers the option to purchase a higher cost “green fare,” which is effectively the purchase of a SAF certificate with their ticket. But at this year’s IATA general meeting in New Delhi, CEO of Airline-FedEx and FedEx International told an audience that Americans are too cost-conscious to pay an additional cost while Europeans are more likely to make the investment.

The good news is that IATA expects SAF production to double to two million tons in 2025. That accounts for 0.7 percent of total aviation fuel demand. With EU and UK mandates taking effect at the start of 2025, the majority of that production will go to Europe. Those mandates have also led to a spike in Europe’s SAF costs.

What’s more, Bain & Company’s December 2024 analysis Sustainable Aviation Fuel: The Supply Race Is On found that European production is expected to hit a 20 percent shortfall of mandate requirements by 2030. On top of that, the EU prohibits SAF production that relies on certain feedstocks such as corn, soybeans, cooking oil and animal fats because this may cause land use and food production to compete with SAF production. Without one of the most developed means of SAF production, the industry will have to quickly ramp up development of alternative feedstocks and latent technologies. The alternative is to import feedstock. As any importation generates carbon emissions, this would negate the purpose of SAF mandates. Although the UNFCCC only requires reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from domestic production, not imports. So on paper, importing SAF materials could potentially show a net positive.

“Coordination at the regulatory level globally would be helpful,” said de Fontaine. “Different regulatory jurisdictions have different views of what is sustainable and the EU has taken an aggressive view on keeping SAF focused on waste residues and avoiding associated feedstocks, which is creating some confusion among investors in SAF production. Different requirements in different jurisdictions is fragmenting the market a bit.”

At the aforementioned IATA conference, Pieter Elbers, CEO of India’s largest airline IndiGo, pointed out that SAF isn’t available in the country and he doesn’t see the point in importing. Instead, he looks to other means of driving sustainability, including maintaining a newer fleet and turning to electric ground operations.

In addition to those options, airlines globally are also looking to improve sustainability efforts by recycling plastics used onboard, composting food waste, improving flight planning and optimizing routing.",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/TW/uploadedImages/Custom_Content/Sales/Thought_Leadership/AdobeStock_desk_468763206.jpeg?tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-11-30 16:56:11.582330

Eight OPEC+ countries, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman, recently held a virtual meeting. They discussed global market conditions and future strategies. These nations had previously announced voluntary production adjustments in April and November 2023.

The group confirmed their decision to halt production increases for January through March 2026 due to seasonal factors. They emphasised that the 1.65 million barrels per day could be reinstated partially or fully based on market developments. This approach allows for flexibility in response to changing conditions.

In their commitment to market stability, the countries stressed the importance of a cautious strategy. They plan to continue pausing or reversing voluntary production adjustments as needed. This includes the 2.2 million barrels per day adjustment announced in November 2023.

The eight countries reiterated their dedication to achieving full compliance with the Declaration of Cooperation. This includes adhering to additional voluntary production adjustments monitored by the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC). They also aim to compensate for any excess production since January 2024.

Monthly meetings will be held by these nations to evaluate market conditions, compliance levels, and compensation efforts. This ongoing assessment ensures they remain aligned with their collective goals.

The collaborative efforts of these OPEC+ members highlight their commitment to maintaining market balance while adapting to evolving circumstances. Their strategic decisions are crucial for stabilising oil markets globally.

The recent discovery of naturally occurring hydrogen — also known as native or white hydrogen — in the Wilayat of Suhar has strengthened expectations around its potential development and use in advancing the decarbonisation goals of SOHAR Port and Freezone, according to a senior official of the maritime hub.

Emile Hoogsteden, CEO of SOHAR, highlighted the port’s ongoing collaboration with Swiss natural hydrogen specialist HYNAT SA in exploring subsurface hydrogen in the region. Natural or white hydrogen is geologically generated and found naturally in the Earth’s crust, offering the prospect of direct production from underground reservoirs as a clean, low-carbon energy source.

“Reserves in the area are confirmed and the next stage is extraction testing to assess feasibility and energy potential” Hoogsteden said. “If viable, it would provide a direct, low-carbon fuel source for Sohar’s industries”, he added in an interview with The Energy Year, a UK-based business intelligence platform.

In July, SOHAR signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with HYNAT SA to advance the development of a full natural hydrogen value chain in Oman. The collaboration focuses on identifying and assessing natural hydrogen production zones, developing logistics corridors and creating dedicated storage and processing infrastructure. Earlier in February, the Ministry of Energy and Minerals had also signed an MoU granting HYNAT rights to carry out feasibility studies.

This interest in white hydrogen does not diminish SOHAR’s commitment to green hydrogen. “We are also looking to develop green hydrogen in SOHAR and further strengthen SOHAR’s position as a green manufacturing hub”, Hoogsteden noted.

According to Dr Abdullah al Abri, Vice President — Sustainability, SOHAR already hosts strong hydrogen demand from its refinery, petrochemical and DRI-based steel industries, positioning the port as a natural national hub for green hydrogen production. He said the strategy is to begin with small pilot projects to build experience and confidence, including an investment case now being finalised to install 80–100 MW of grid-connected electrolysers that can supply continuous hydrogen to port industries and avoid the intermittency associated with standalone renewables.

Speaking on The Energy Talks platform, Dr Al Abri explained that this approach de-risks investment, noting that renewables are capital-intensive and often require storage. Connecting electrolysers to a grid that is already about 11% renewable — and expected to reach 30% by 2030 — provides flexibility, enables the use of renewable energy certificates and ensures reliable, uninterrupted hydrogen supply to end users.

He added that SOHAR has also established a partnership with a Swiss consortium to explore a green corridor between Oman and Switzerland, with both countries sharing carbon-neutrality goals and building on a 2023 intergovernmental framework agreement to develop an implementation road map and associated projects.

According to Dr Al Abri, hydrogen is a strategic commodity for SOHAR. The port already supports a range of industries and LNG bunkering, with methanation identified as the next step. As biofuel industries develop, their biogenic CO₂ streams can be used to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other green fuels — a pathway closely aligned with SOHAR’s long-term decarbonisation agenda, in which hydrogen remains a central pillar.",https://www.omanobserver.om/omanobserver/uploads/images/2025/11/30/thumbs/600x600/3208228.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 12:56:35.910136

-OneArabia

The National Automotive and Vehicles Academy (NAVA) has partnered with CEER, Saudi Arabia's first homegrown electric vehicle brand, to introduce an Intermediate Diploma Program in Automotive Manufacturing Technology. This collaboration was formalised during the ""Generation Future Day"" at the 21st General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) in Riyadh, under the auspices of Minister of Industry and Mineral Resources Bandar Alkhorayef.

This initiative aims to bolster Saudi Arabia's automotive sector by training 300 local trainees over the coming years. The program is designed to enhance national capabilities in electric vehicle manufacturing, aligning with Saudi Vision 2030's objectives to develop competitive national industries. By focusing on industrial localisation and productivity, it seeks to prepare a new generation of Saudi talent ready to lead the sector.

Mohammed Al-Suhaim, Managing Director of NAVA Academy, highlighted that this agreement extends the academy’s commitment to supporting national industrial transformation. He stated: ""At NAVA, we are proud to be an active partner in developing the electric vehicle sector in the Kingdom. Our role goes beyond delivering training programs; it extends to empowering Saudi youth to join high-quality jobs within leading national companies like CEER, which enhances the presence of national talents in modern industries.""

CEER's Chief Executive James DeLuca emphasised their dedication to nurturing local talent as a catalyst for innovation and growth. He remarked: ""As part of our role in igniting the Kingdom’s automotive industry, we believe that developing national talent is a key driver of innovation and growth. As a founding partner of NAVA, we are committed to equipping Saudi technicians with the knowledge and skills needed to lead the future of the automotive sector in the Kingdom.""

This strategic partnership not only supports industrial goals but also contributes significantly towards achieving Saudi Vision 2030. By focusing on training and qualifying local talent, it aims to create a skilled workforce capable of advancing modern industries within Saudi Arabia. The collaboration between NAVA and CEER is expected to play a crucial role in shaping the future of automotive manufacturing technology in the region.

The agreement reflects a broader effort to enhance national productivity by fostering skills development among young Saudis. It underscores a commitment to building a robust foundation for sustainable growth within the automotive sector while ensuring that local talents are well-prepared for emerging opportunities.

This initiative marks an important step towards realising Saudi Arabia's ambitions for its automotive industry. By equipping trainees with essential skills and knowledge, it lays the groundwork for future leaders who will drive innovation and progress within this vital sector.

Allt som kallas hållbart är det inte heller: vissa nya bränslen kan ge lika stora klimatutsläpp som fossila bränslen.

Miljöorganisationer har länge ifrågasatt flygbranschens visioner av ett fortsatt men hållbart flygande. Men nu görs detta även på grundval av en ekonomisk analys. Carbon Tracker, som gett ut en rapport om frågan, är en finansiell tankesmedja som hjälper företag och investerare på vägen mot ett mindre fossilberoende.

Slam, avfall och sockerrör

Hållbart flygbränsle, kallat SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), är flytande bränslen tillverkade med olika tekniker och utifrån olika råvaror. Råvarorna kan vara skogs- och jordbruksrester, avloppsslam och avfall, men även energigrödor och matgrödor som sockerrör och majs.

Den stora fördelen med dessa bränslen är att de är så lika vanligt jetbränsle: det är bara att fylla på dem i flygplanet. Den stora nackdelen är att just denna likhet ger bränslena samma utsläpp som jetbränslet när de förbränns. En eventuell klimatvinst måste därför komma från själva råvaran.

Enligt Carbon Trackers rapport finns det en rad hinder för utvecklingen av hållbart flygbränsle. Några handlar om regler och ekonomi. Somliga delar av världen, som EU, har regler som kräver en viss inblandning av SAF, men andra har det inte. Flygbranschen arbetar allmänt sett med en kort tidshorisont, men detta är ett område som kräver långsiktiga satsningar. SAF-projekt är också ofta komplicerade och dyra, vilket kan avskräcka investerare.

Begränsade mängder

Flygresenärer kan idag välja ett tillägg som ger en viss del hållbart flygbränsle i en resa. Men det kostar lite mer, och alla gör det inte – som Mattias Goldmann nyligen påpekade i en fristående krönika i Supermiljöbloggen, så gjordes det inte ens av de svenskar som deltog i COP-mötet i Brasilien. Och om många skulle efterfråga hållbart flygbränsle, så skulle detta helt enkelt inte räcka till.

De mest lätthanterliga rest-råvarorna till sådant bränsle, som överbliven frityrolja, finns nämligen inte alls i tillräckliga mängder. Jord- och skogsbruksrester finns det mer av, men dessa måste först samlas in från stora arealer och transporteras långa sträckor, vilket blir dyrt. Kommunalt avfall består av många olika ämnen och kan behöva försorteras eller förbehandlas. Och att odla råvaror särskilt för att bli bränslen ger stora utsläpp.

Vissa alternativa bränslen, särskilt de som bygger på mat- eller fodergrödor, ger nästan lika stora klimatutsläpp som fossila bränslen eller till och med mer, heter det i rapporten.

Många andra intressenter

Både branschen och politikerna måste också ta hänsyn till andra möjliga användningar av råvarorna. Skogs- och jordbruksrester kan till exempel också användas i värmeverk. Avloppsslam kan bli gödning, och överbliven matolja kan gå till plast- och kosmetikaindustrin. Här behövs en noggrann analys som kan visa var respektive råvara gör bäst klimatnytta.

Enligt Carbon Tracker lär kortare sträckor ganska snart kunna flygas på batterier eller vätebaserade bränsleceller. Då bör de begränsade mängderna av hållbart flygbränsle sparas till längre sträckor. Möjligen kan så kallade elektrobränslen, syntetiskt framställda bränslen med vätgas och koldioxid som bas, komma in i framtiden. Men andra åtgärder måste också till, menar man: en större bränsleeffektivitet, bättre trafikledning och policybeslut som kan minska efterfrågan på flygresor.",https://supermiljobloggen.se/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/airbus-8607152-1280-600x422.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 12:56:41.349293

This advanced performance reflects the efforts of the Saudi Authority for Intellectual Property to enhance public awareness of and respect for intellectual property rights, as well as to expand national initiatives aimed at improving compliance and reducing violations.
These measures have helped strengthen consumer confidence in original products and underscore the societal value of intellectual property rights.","King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) has signed a new material transfer agreement (MTA) with the Arabian Petroleum Supply Company (Apsco), under which Apsco will supply KAUST with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for research on next-generation low-emission fuels.

According to a KAUST press release, the collaboration comes at a critical time for the aviation industry.

Under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulations, airlines are required to use a 2% SAF blend by 2025, increasing to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050—targets that remain out of reach with today’s fuel technologies. Meanwhile, global SAF demand is expected to surge from 2 million metric tons in 2025 to 10 million in 2030 and 75 million by 2040, SPA reported.

Professors Mani Sarathy, Thibault Guiberti, Aamir Farooq, and Hong Im will lead the research, which will focus on the chemical properties, reaction pathways, and combustion behavior of the provided fuels. The new data on fuel behavior, emissions characteristics, and performance metrics will build a comprehensive database that will develop models for the creation of future SAF formulations of higher efficiency and lower environmental impact.

“This partnership allows us to combine world-class experimental facilities with advanced artificial intelligence to fundamentally reimagine how sustainable aviation fuels are designed,” said Sarathy. “Using the new data generated, our models will help identify efficient, cleaner, and more scalable fuel formulations that can support the aviation sector’s ambitious climate goals.”

The release also highlighted that globally, the aviation industry is increasingly turning to create predictive models for fuel behavior from partial datasets, reducing development cycles from years to months. Beyond fuel design, the project will help bridge critical knowledge gaps that currently slow SAF adoption worldwide, from understanding emissions behavior to assessing how fuels perform across a range of operating environments. By answering these fundamental questions, the partnership will enable industry and regulators to make faster, more informed decisions about future SAF deployment.

Apsco CEO Dr. Azzam Qari stated, “This collaboration with KAUST marks an important milestone for Apsco and for the future of sustainable aviation in the Kingdom. As the global aviation sector moves rapidly toward lower-carbon solutions, investing in local research and national capabilities in SAF is no longer optional; it is strategic. Through this agreement, our role goes beyond supplying fuel for testing; we are helping build the scientific and technical foundation that can enable Saudi-developed SAF technologies in the years ahead.”

Moreover, as Saudi Arabia expands its aviation network and explores domestic SAF production opportunities, the ability to test and validate fuel properties within the Kingdom scientifically becomes increasingly essential. Building local research infrastructure accelerates certification, supports national sustainability targets, and strengthens the country’s position in the future global aviation fuel market. With research facilities already in place, KAUST will provide the scientific foundation needed to accelerate domestic SAF research in the Kingdom, supporting the goals of the Saudi Aviation Strategy to advance low-carbon, next generation energy technologies.

Saudi Arabia achieved a new international milestone by ranking among the top performers in the Global intellectual property perception survey 2025 (WIPO Pulse), issued by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which surveyed 35,500 participants from 74 countries to assess public awareness of intellectual property and its economic and social impact.

The Kingdom ranked among the highest globally in awareness of the role of intellectual property in supporting the economy, with national awareness of its impact on economic growth and innovation reaching approximately 80%, placing it at the top of this global indicator, according to SPA.

Saudi Arabia also recorded notable growth in youth and women’s awareness of intellectual property rights, making it a leading contributor to raising the average performance of countries in the Asia-Pacific region in this area.

This advanced performance reflects the efforts of the Saudi Authority for Intellectual Property to enhance public awareness of and respect for intellectual property rights, as well as to expand national initiatives aimed at improving compliance and reducing violations.

These measures have helped strengthen consumer confidence in original products and underscore the societal value of intellectual property rights.

British finance minister Rachel Reeves on Sunday denied she misled the public over official forecasts ahead of this month's budget, saying she had been honest about the need to build up a bigger fiscal buffer.

In a speech on November 4, Reeves appeared to lay the groundwork to break the Labour Party's promise to voters before the 2024 election and raise income tax rates, citing a ""weaker than previously thought"" productivity performance.

In a letter published on Friday, the head of Britain's budget watchdog said it had also provided the government with forecasts showing that its productivity downgrade was offset by increases in real wages and inflation - which Reeves did not mention.

The letter added to questions about the government's communications ahead of Wednesday's budget. November saw big swings in the British government bond market as investors grappled with shifts in tone from the government over the prospect of tax increases.

Its publication prompted the opposition Conservative Party to demand that Reeves resign for misleading the public about the economic situation ahead of her November 26 budget.

According to Reuters, Reeves told the BBC that she intended to stay as finance minister for a long time.

""I have been underestimated all the way through my life,"" Reeves said. ""I'm proud of my budget this week.""

The confidential forecasts provided to Reeves by the Office for Budget Responsibility watchdog before her November 4 speech showed she would meet her fiscal rules by a margin of 4.2 billion pounds, not including any budget measures or the reversal of welfare cuts earlier in the year.

On Sunday, Reeves told Sky News that boosting that buffer - which would have been very thin by historical standards - was her main concern, which required her to deliver a tough message to the public.

""The just over 4 billion pounds surplus was not enough,"" Reeves said. ""The headroom would not have been enough, and it would not give the Bank of England space to continue cutting interest rates.""

When the budget was announced on Wednesday, Reeves had more than doubled her headroom against the fiscal rules to 21.7 billion pounds from 9.9 billion pounds in her previous fiscal plan.",https://static.srpcdigital.com/styles/1200x600/public/2025-11/1289703_0.png.webp,N,,2025-11-30 13:57:30.597958

African finance ministers attending the 2025 Africa Investment Forum (AIF) have called for a decisive shift from highlighting potential opportunities to delivering execution-ready, investment-grade projects.

Their message was clear: the continent’s transformation must be driven by private capital, not aid.

Speaking during the Ministerial Dialogue on Accelerating Private Investment Through Conducive Enabling Environments, ministers from Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guinea, Mauritania, Morocco and Zambia outlined the reforms required to strengthen investor confidence, improve regulatory frameworks and build resilient business environments capable of attracting long-term funding.

Côte d’Ivoire’s Minister of Economic Planning and Development, Nialé Kaba, said Africa’s biggest obstacle remains project readiness.

“Africa’s problem is that opportunities and projects are not mature,” she said. She highlighted Côte d’Ivoire’s progress, including simplified investment codes and single-window systems that have helped lift private investment from 12% of GDP in 2020 to 20% today.

Zambia’s Minister of Finance and National Planning Situmbeko Musokotwane said the country is emerging from its debt crisis, supported by an improved credit rating.

Over the past three years, Zambia has secured nearly $2 billion in public-private partnerships and attracted more than $7 billion in new mining investment. He noted that streamlining project approvals to under 45 days has helped unlock billions in private energy investments.

Musokotwane also spotlighted the privately financed Lobito Corridor, set to become Africa’s first east-west transcontinental rail link, which will connect Zambia and the DRC to Angola’s Atlantic ports.

Morocco’s Economy and Finance Minister Nadia Fettah stressed that investors are no longer looking for potential, but for “ready projects delivered with speed and strong execution capacity.”

She urged African governments to maintain a year-round pipeline of regional projects and argued that pooling resources across borders is essential for large-scale developments in rail, aviation and data infrastructure.

Mauritania’s Minister of Economic Affairs and Development, Abdullah Suleiman Sheikh Sidiya, said Africa is increasingly seen as an investment destination rather than an aid-dependent continent.

“Africa is becoming a sought-after destination—not only for cooperation but increasingly for investment,” he said.

Guinea’s Minister of Planning and International Cooperation, Ismael Nabe, underscored the role of strong project preparation in lowering investment risk. He highlighted Guinea’s UK-Export Finance-backed Administrative City as a model of replicable development, inspired by similar projects in Benin.

Nabe described the Africa Investment Forum as a “compass” for guiding co-financing and innovation. Successful initiatives in one country, he said, can be adapted across the region through blended finance tools and partnerships with institutions such as the African Development Bank Group and Middle Eastern sovereign funds.

Segundo o anúncio da Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), as passagens vendidas a partir de 1º de abril de 2026, para voos que partem de Singapura a partir de 1º de outubro de 2026, já terão incorporada a taxa.

Detalhes da medida

A taxa varia conforme destino e classe da viagem. Por exemplo, para voos dentro do Sudeste Asiático, cobrança de SGD 1 (≈ US$ 0,77) em classe econômica; para rotas longas (como às Américas) pode atingir SGD 10,40 ou mais para econômica, e valores maiores para as classes premium.

O valor arrecadado será destinado à compra centralizada de SAF, produzido a partir de óleos residuais ou biomassa, garantindo uma mistura mínima de 1% de SAF a partir de 2026, e avançando para entre 3% e 5% até 2030, conforme disponibilidade e preço do mercado.

Em paralelo, a meta da CAAS prevê que o uso obrigatório de SAF nos voos de partida de Singapura seja implementado já em 2026.

O custo da nova taxa climática para os viajantes partindo de Singapura será modesto – mas simbólico. Ela cria um mecanismo de compartilhamento de despesas entre setor aéreo, passageiros e combustíveis sustentáveis.

Embora a aviação responda por cerca de 1,2% das emissões globais de gases de efeito estufa, seu desafio de descarbonização é elevado: o SAF segue com produção limitada (em torno de 0,3% do combustível em 2023) e custo maior que o querosene fóssil tradicional.

Eventuais desafios e observações

A produção de SAF ainda está restrita: garantir mix mínimo e escala será um gargalo para que a meta de 1% em 2026 seja factível.

A comunicação ao passageiro precisa ser transparente para evitar percepções de “taxa surpresa”.

O impacto competitivo da medida será limitado em termos de preço ao consumidor, mas pode crescer se o mix de SAF precisar ser ampliado significativamente.

Com a nova taxa climática sobre passagens, Singapura buscar atuar junto à aviação de maneira mais verde. A introdução da cobrança a partir de 2026 e a obrigatoriedade do SAF representam um modelo inovador para o setor aéreo. Acompanhar como será implementada e se outras regiões seguirão será crucial para o futuro da aviação sustentável.

The growing demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has driven innovation in alternative fuel technologies, with synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) emerging as a viable candidate as it offers a reduction in environmental footprint compared to conventional fossil fuels. In this study, the feasibility of biomass-derived SPK was explored, utilizing corn stover as the process feedstock. The designed process integrates key thermochemical processes such as gasification, Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis, and hydrocracking, to convert corn stover into SPK. The process was simulated in commercial software Aspen Plus V12, where its material and energy flows were analyzed. Moreover, the Anderson-Schulz Flory distribution model was used to determine the FT product distribution. The simulation results show a 75 % molar conversion of carbon monoxide and a biomass-to-SPK conversion of 6 % was achieved. The sustainability of the developed process was assessed through its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, with syngas cleaning reducing emissions by 30.70 %, resulting in a carbon footprint of 0.58 kg CO2/kg syngas. The remaining CO2 in the FT fuel underwent flashing and adsorption, enabling 63.27 % recovery for reuse in steam and power plants. Subsequently, the total capital investment, including working and fixed capitals, were estimated. The FT-SPK pathway was proven to be costly due to the energy-intensive processes. However, a positive ROI and a payback period within 5 y were achieved. The product selling prices were also ascertained alongside a breakeven analysis to ensure that the manufacturing operation remains economically viable.",https://www.cetjournal.it/public/journals/1/favicon_en_US.png,N,,2025-11-30 13:57:35.769514

OVER 3 MLN BPD OF OUTPUT CUTS STILL IN PLACE

Brent crude closed on Friday near $63 a barrel, down 15% this year.

OPEC+ has paused oil output hikes for the first quarter of 2026 after releasing some 2.9 million barrels per day into the market since April 2025.

The group still has about 3.24 million bpd of output cuts in place, representing around 3% of global demand, and the Sunday meeting did not alter those.

OPEC said the group had approved a mechanism to assess members' maximum production capacity to be used for setting output quotas from 2027.

Saudi Arabia achieved a new international milestone by ranking among the top performers in the Global intellectual property perception survey 2025 (WIPO Pulse), issued by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which surveyed 35,500 participants from 74 countries to assess public awareness of intellectual property and its economic and social impact.

The Kingdom ranked among the highest globally in awareness of the role of intellectual property in supporting the economy, with national awareness of its impact on economic growth and innovation reaching approximately 80%, placing it at the top of this global indicator, according to SPA.

Saudi Arabia also recorded notable growth in youth and women’s awareness of intellectual property rights, making it a leading contributor to raising the average performance of countries in the Asia-Pacific region in this area.

This advanced performance reflects the efforts of the Saudi Authority for Intellectual Property to enhance public awareness of and respect for intellectual property rights, as well as to expand national initiatives aimed at improving compliance and reducing violations.

These measures have helped strengthen consumer confidence in original products and underscore the societal value of intellectual property rights.

British finance minister Rachel Reeves on Sunday denied she misled the public over official forecasts ahead of this month's budget, saying she had been honest about the need to build up a bigger fiscal buffer.

In a speech on November 4, Reeves appeared to lay the groundwork to break the Labour Party's promise to voters before the 2024 election and raise income tax rates, citing a ""weaker than previously thought"" productivity performance.

In a letter published on Friday, the head of Britain's budget watchdog said it had also provided the government with forecasts showing that its productivity downgrade was offset by increases in real wages and inflation - which Reeves did not mention.

The letter added to questions about the government's communications ahead of Wednesday's budget. November saw big swings in the British government bond market as investors grappled with shifts in tone from the government over the prospect of tax increases.

Its publication prompted the opposition Conservative Party to demand that Reeves resign for misleading the public about the economic situation ahead of her November 26 budget.

According to Reuters, Reeves told the BBC that she intended to stay as finance minister for a long time.

""I have been underestimated all the way through my life,"" Reeves said. ""I'm proud of my budget this week.""

The confidential forecasts provided to Reeves by the Office for Budget Responsibility watchdog before her November 4 speech showed she would meet her fiscal rules by a margin of 4.2 billion pounds, not including any budget measures or the reversal of welfare cuts earlier in the year.

On Sunday, Reeves told Sky News that boosting that buffer - which would have been very thin by historical standards - was her main concern, which required her to deliver a tough message to the public.

""The just over 4 billion pounds surplus was not enough,"" Reeves said. ""The headroom would not have been enough, and it would not give the Bank of England space to continue cutting interest rates.""

When the budget was announced on Wednesday, Reeves had more than doubled her headroom against the fiscal rules to 21.7 billion pounds from 9.9 billion pounds in her previous fiscal plan.",https://static.srpcdigital.com/styles/1200x600/public/2025-11/1289466_0.png.webp,N,,2025-11-30 12:57:12.144500

For the first time, he no longer relies on grid electricity, and year-round farming has become possible.
Young people, once determined to flee the village, are beginning to see farming as a viable livelihood rather than a last resort.
He had saved what little he could from long shifts, fully prepared to attempt the clandestine route through Djibouti.
“Now I see young people making something of themselves here, if they can get land.","In a quiet village just outside the bustling town of Batu—where Dutch-owned flower farms dominate the landscape—23-year-old Alemu Baba has chosen a path that many of his peers have long abandoned: he has become a farmer.

While most young men from his community embark on perilous journeys toward Yemen and Libya, gambling their lives for a chance to reach Europe or the Gulf, Alemu returned home. After months working as a construction laborer in Bishoftu for a wage he says “barely covered daily expenses,” he faced a future that, in his words, “looked completely empty.”

“I didn’t see a way forward in the city, and people my age thought farming had no future,” he said. “But now I’m earning enough to support my family, and I’m even planning to expand into bee farming.”

Alemu is part of a growing cohort of young people finding new promise in agriculture, aided by the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), a Seoul-based organization working to modernize farming in low-income communities. Over the past two years, the Institute has introduced training and technology to roughly 400 farmers in the region, helping them shift from subsistence production to sustainable, market-oriented agriculture. The effort—funded by the Italian government under a project titled Fostering Food Security to Prevent Conflict and Ensure Stability—includes access to vermicompost, climate-smart tools, and support to help farmers become food secure and profitable.

Among the beneficiaries is Alemu’s father, 50-year-old Baba Morki, a lifelong farmer in AbjataKebele of Adami Tulu JidoKombolchaWoreda. He has witnessed not only his own transformation but that of his neighbors.

Baba has been part of the program from the start, receiving training in entrepreneurship, organic market linkages, and the use of solar-powered irrigation systems—three of which now irrigate a combined 130 hectares in an area once defined by chronic water shortages. For the first time, he no longer relies on grid electricity, and year-round farming has become possible.

“In the past, if the weather failed us, we sold livestock just to survive,” he said. “It kept us poor and without hope.”

Today, Baba says, the change is visible everywhere. Herds are growing. Income is more stable. Young people, once determined to flee the village, are beginning to see farming as a viable livelihood rather than a last resort.

“Before, our work was seasonal and labor intensive. Now we farm continuously, earn more, and finally dream bigger for our children,” he said. “They no longer need to leave home to build a future.”

Both Baba and his son have earned enough from their fields to build modern homes—an unlikely outcome just a few years ago.

GGGI, which began operations in Ethiopia in 2010, aims to help the country build a climate-resilient green economy by 2030 and reduce its reliance on emergency food aid. More than 10 million Ethiopians currently require humanitarian assistance, according to the United Nations.

The shift toward sustainable agriculture is also reshaping young people’s aspirations beyond the farms themselves. In Batu, 21-year-old waiter and tourism graduate Brook Teshome recalls planning his own journey abroad. He had saved what little he could from long shifts, fully prepared to attempt the clandestine route through Djibouti.

But watching farmers—including his older brother—reap the benefits of the new practices has changed his thinking.

“I used to believe the only way to succeed was to leave,” he said. “Now I see young people making something of themselves here, if they can get land. I’m even considering becoming a farmer instead of working for someone else.”

A similar transformation is underway in Bulbula, where farmer AmanGemeda has expanded his operations with the help of solar irrigation and vermicompost on land that now sits alongside the new Batu–Hawassa freeway.

Aman says that many people are seeing farming in a different light.“My experience is showing others that farming can be different—that we’re not defined by the shortages and hunger that once shaped our lives,” Aman said.",https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/The-Reporter-Ethiopia.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 11:56:49.785182

The collaboration is timely, as the aviation industry faces increasing pressure to adopt cleaner fuel technologies.

Under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulations, airlines must use a 2% SAF blend by 2025, which will rise to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. Current fuel technologies are insufficient to meet these targets. Global demand for SAF is projected to grow significantly, from 2 million metric tons in 2025 to 10 million in 2030 and reaching 75 million by 2040.

The research at KAUST will be led by Professors Mani Sarathy, Thibault Guiberti, Aamir Farooq, and Hong Im. Their work will concentrate on understanding the chemical properties, reaction pathways, and combustion behavior of the supplied fuels. This research aims to develop a comprehensive database that will aid in creating future SAF formulations with higher efficiency and lower environmental impact.

""This partnership allows us to combine world-class experimental facilities with advanced artificial intelligence to fundamentally reimagine how sustainable aviation fuels are designed,"" said Sarathy. ""Using the new data generated, our models will help identify efficient, cleaner, and more scalable fuel formulations that can support the aviation sector’s ambitious climate goals.""

The aviation industry worldwide is increasingly using predictive models for fuel behavior based on partial datasets. This approach reduces development cycles from years to months. The project aims not only at designing better fuels but also at addressing knowledge gaps that hinder SAF adoption globally. By understanding emissions behavior and assessing performance across various environments, the partnership seeks to enable faster decision-making regarding SAF deployment.

Apsco CEO Dr. Azzam Qari remarked, ""This collaboration with KAUST marks an important milestone for Apsco and for the future of sustainable aviation in the Kingdom. As the global aviation sector moves rapidly toward lower-carbon solutions, investing in local research and national capabilities in SAF is no longer optional; it is strategic.""

Strategic Importance for Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia's expanding aviation network and exploration of domestic SAF production opportunities make scientific testing of fuel properties within the Kingdom increasingly vital. Developing local research infrastructure accelerates certification processes, supports national sustainability goals, and strengthens Saudi Arabia's position in the future global aviation fuel market.

KAUST's existing research facilities provide a solid foundation for advancing domestic SAF research in line with the Saudi Aviation Strategy's objectives of promoting low-carbon energy technologies. This initiative is crucial as Saudi Arabia aims to enhance its role in sustainable aviation fuel development globally.

Airlines worked through the night after global regulators told them to remedy the problem before resuming flights.

Airlines that said they had completed or nearly finished all their software updates on Saturday included American Airlines, United Airlines, Air India, Delta Air Lines, Hungary’s Wizz Air, Mexico's Volaris, Air Arabia, Saudi Arabia's Flyadeal, and Taiwan's carriers. Many reported no impact on operations.

The overnight effort by airlines appeared to help head off the worst-case scenario and capped the number of flight delays in Asia and Europe. In the United States, which will face high demand after the Thanksgiving holiday period, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that impacted U.S. carriers ""have reported great progress, and are on track to meet the deadline of this Sunday at midnight to complete the work.""

He posted on X that travellers ""SHOULD NOT expect any major disruptions,"" although one U.S. airline, JetBlue, later said it cancelled dozens of flights that had been scheduled for Sunday.

Asia-based aviation analyst Brendan Sobie said the update was ""not as chaotic as some people might think,"" although ""it does create some short-term headaches for operations.""

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury apologised to airlines and passengers after the surprise recall of 6,000 planes, or more than half of the global A320-family fleet, which recently overtook the Boeing 737 as the industry's most-delivered model.

""I want to sincerely apologise to our airline customers and passengers who are impacted now,"" Faury posted on LinkedIn.

Friday's alert followed an unintended loss of altitude on an October 30 JetBlue flight from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, which injured 10 passengers, according to France's BEA accident agency, which is probing the incident.

AIRBUS RECALL LUCKY TIMING FOR SOME AIRLINES

The alert landed at a time of day when many European airlines and Asian airlines are winding down their schedules, leaving time for repairs. In the United States, however, it came during the day ahead of the busy Thanksgiving holiday travel weekend.

U.S. carrier JetBlue said it cancelled about 70 flights that were scheduled for Sunday, with more cancellations possible. JetBlue expects to finish software updates for 120 planes by Sunday morning, but said fixes for about 30 aircraft would still be ""in progress"" at that point.

About 140 jets in the company's fleet of A320, A321 and A220 aircraft did not need the fix, the company said.

American Airlines, the world's largest A320 operator, said 209 of its 480 jets needed the fix, below initial estimates, most of which it expected to complete by Saturday. United Airlines told Reuters on Saturday that all its aircraft had been updated.

AirAsia, one of the world's largest A320 customers, said it aimed to complete fixes in 48 hours. India's aviation regulator said on Saturday that carriers IndiGo INGL.NS and Air India were expected to complete the process on Saturday. ANA Holdings 9202.T cancelled 95 flights on Saturday, affecting 13,500 travellers.

Taiwan's low-cost airline Tigerair said eight flights would be delayed on Sunday due to the software issue.

Airlines must revert to a previous version of software in a computer that helps determine the nose angle of the affected jets and in some cases must also change the hardware itself, mainly on older planes in service. The fix must be completed before the planes can fly again with passengers, a process needing two to three hours per jet.

Globally, there are about 11,300 of the single-aisle jets in service, including 6,440 of the core A320 model. Those include some of the largest and busiest low-cost carriers.

Tracker data from Cirium and FlightAware showed most global airports operating with good-to-moderate levels of delays.

By Saturday, Airbus was telling airlines that repairs to some of the A320 jets affected may be less burdensome than first thought, industry sources said, with fewer than the original estimate of 1,000 needing the time-consuming hardware changes.

There were also unresolved questions about the impact of solar flare radiation blamed for the JetBlue incident, which is being treated by French investigators as an ""incident,"" the lowest of three categories of potential safety emergency.

""Any operational challenges that come at short notice and affecting a large part of your operation is tough to deal with,"" said UK-based aviation consultant John Strickland.

Recent Developments In Aviation Fuel Market Trends, Segmentation & Forecast 2034

Recent activity in the aviation fuel sector has been shaped strongly by new long-term supply agreements and strategic fuel-trade partnerships. One of the most significant developments came when Unipec, the trading arm of Sinopec, finalized a multi-year agreement to supply Lufthansa with around 60,000 metric tons of jet fuel per year, reinforcing stable jet-fuel availability across key airports in Germany and Belgium. This deal also reflects an expansion of Unipec’s broader aviation-fuel footprint, as the company has been supplying millions of tons of jet fuel annually across Europe and North Africa. At the same time, major airlines such as KLM have deepened cooperation with fuel traders to secure consistent access to both conventional jet fuel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), highlighting the continued need for diversified supply channels.

Investments in sustainable aviation fuel production have accelerated sharply, with multiple energy companies and aircraft manufacturers backing large-scale commercial SAF projects. One of the largest commitments came from Ecopetrol, Colombia’s national oil company, which approved US $500-700 million for constructing a new SAF production plant integrated into its Barrancabermeja refinery. The plant is being designed to produce roughly 6,000 barrels per day once operational — a milestone that would position Colombia as a key regional supplier. Parallel to this, Airbus expanded its role beyond aircraft manufacturing by co-founding a dedicated financing alliance for SAF projects and investing directly in LanzaJet to scale its Alcohol-to-Jet production pathway. These investments illustrate how the aviation ecosystem is moving from pilot projects to industrial-scale SAF capacity backed by major energy and aerospace stakeholders.

Regulatory and operational developments have also transformed the aviation fuel landscape across major regions. In the European Union, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation entered key implementation phases in 2025, with mandated SAF blending requirements beginning at 2% for all EU airports and preparing for higher obligations in the coming years. This regulatory pressure has already driven airports and fuel suppliers to adjust logistics, certification, and blending infrastructure. Meanwhile, in India, Boeing partnered with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited to advance a domestic SAF ecosystem, working on certification pathways, feedstock optimization, and nationwide supply-chain planning. Boeing additionally highlighted India’s potential to produce up to 8-10 million metric tons of SAF annually due to its agricultural-residue base, indicating that new producer nations are emerging beyond the traditional jet-fuel hubs. Collectively, these developments show a global shift in how aviation fuel is produced, regulated, and supplied — with SAF integration now embedded in national strategies, airline procurement models, and manufacturer-led innovation programs.

The activity comes shortly after a strong third-quarter performance and an optimistic outlook for the year ahead.

Shares of Par Pacific Holdings have been surging on strong momentum, up 31.8% over the last three months and reporting an impressive year-to-date share price return of 173.5%. Following recent deal activity and positive quarterly results, investors seem to be reassessing the company's long-term growth potential. This has been reflected in a 161.9% total return over the past year.

If Par Pacific’s pace has you rethinking where to spot the next breakout, it’s a great moment to broaden your search and discover

With shares near multi-year highs and analysts raising targets, investors are left to wonder: is Par Pacific Holdings truly undervalued, or is the market already factoring in the next wave of growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 3.6% Undervalued

Par Pacific Holdings’ widely tracked fair value estimate is $47.38, just above the last close of $45.65. This presents a close contest between market optimism and fundamentals. The stage is set for deeper analysis as investors weigh these valuations against the company's performance and projections.

The strategic partnership with Mitsubishi and ENEOS, along with the upcoming SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) project launch, positions Par Pacific for growth in renewable fuels. This enhances market access, leverages global feedstock procurement expertise, and is expected to positively contribute to earnings and net margin expansion starting in 2026.

Bold assumptions are built into this valuation. Future margins, earnings power, and a targeted profit multiple underpin these forecasts, but the real drivers might surprise you. Want to see exactly what’s fueling the bullish outlook? Break down the narrative’s math and see how it justifies that price target.

Result: Fair Value of $47.38 (UNDERVALUED)

However, renewed regulatory scrutiny or unexpected downtime at Par Pacific’s aging refinery network could quickly challenge even the most optimistic assumptions that support this outlook.

Another View: Looking Through the Market’s Lens

Stepping away from fair value models, let’s consider where Par Pacific stands versus its peers by looking at the price-to-earnings ratio. Par Pacific trades at 9.7x, which is lower than the industry average of 13.4x and the peer average of 23.3x, but slightly higher than its own fair ratio estimate of 8.4x. This may indicate current optimism or additional valuation risk. Could the market be overlooking something, or is this a value trap in disguise?

Fluor Investment Narrative Recap

To be a Fluor shareholder, you need to trust in the company’s ability to secure and deliver large-scale infrastructure and industrial projects, while actively managing project risks and maintaining healthy cash flow. The recently announced State Highway 6 expansion in Texas underscores the strength of Fluor’s backlog, but it does not directly alter the most important short-term catalyst, cash generation from ongoing project execution, or diminish the biggest risk, which remains project delays and cost overruns that can impact margins and liquidity.

Among recent announcements, Fluor’s contract win for Project Speedbird, focusing on sustainable aviation fuel production in England, stands out as the most relevant to the SH-6 news since both demonstrate momentum in capturing diverse, high-value contracts. These awards reinforce the catalyst of growing Fluor’s backlog in critical infrastructure and industrial markets, although the timing and profitability of project delivery stay central to near-term investor focus.

However, with Fluor’s ongoing challenges around project delays and cost controls, investors should also be aware that...

Fluor's outlook anticipates $19.6 billion in revenue and $511.6 million in earnings by 2028. This scenario assumes a yearly revenue growth rate of 6.2% alongside a significant decrease in earnings of $3.6 billion from the current $4.1 billion.

, a 19% upside to its current price.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Eight fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community range from US$44.65 to US$65.50 per share. While community opinions vary widely, keep an eye on the risk of project delays and rising costs, which could weigh on short-term profitability and are key factors for anyone tracking Fluor’s performance.

The story of the United States corn ethanol industry is a story about a sector that grew rapidly under a very specific set of policy, technology and market conditions. It filled a gap when gasoline demand was rising, when climate policy focused on incremental change, and when EVs were still a niche. It became a major part of the Midwestern political economy. It shaped land use patterns. It supported thousands of farmers and dozens of rural communities built around steady demand for transport fuel. That world is shifting and the signals point toward a twenty year horizon that looks very different from the previous twenty, with very significant implications for the Midwest’s economies and likely politics.

Corn ethanol grew from a small program focused on oxygenates into a national industry producing over 16 billion gallons annually, about 48 million metric tons. The Renewable Fuel Standard created guaranteed demand by requiring refiners to blend increasing amounts of ethanol into gasoline. Direct subsidies through the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit helped expand capacity. By the late 2000s the industry had become large enough to hold political weight in Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and Nebraska. Ethanol plants became anchor employers. Farmers gained a new buyer that consumed nearly 40% of the national corn crop. The system became predictable and self reinforcing. All gasoline sold in the country now has about 10% ethanol added, with some higher blends available in some places. Once direct subsidies expired, the mandate and a large fleet of internal combustion vehicles kept the industry stable. That stability is now being tested by structural changes in transportation and energy.

The first challenge appears in the gasoline market itself. EIA data from 2015 through 2019 shows finished motor gasoline stabilizing at roughly 140 billion gallons a year. The post pandemic rebound never reached that range again. By 2024 gasoline demand had slipped below pre pandemic levels even though the population was larger than in 2019. The shift is not a statistical quirk. Efficiency gains, hybrid penetration and improved powertrain design are pushing gasoline demand down. Even modest EV adoption affects fuel consumption more than most people expect because each EV replaces an entire household’s gasoline demand, not a small slice of it. Hybrid and work from home models that are common after COVID also inhibit demand. Gasoline peaks are rarely jagged events. They plateau and then begin slow but durable declines. Ethanol demand sits inside that shrinking pool. Rising blend rates cannot compensate if the base declines year after year.

E15, a blend of 15% ethanol and 85% gasoline, creates a small lift for producers, but there is no serious national move toward E30 or higher mid level blends. The political energy behind E15 has come from arguments about supply expansion and consumer cost, not carbon intensity or long term strategy. E30 requires different infrastructure and testing. It requires automakers to warrant engines for higher blends. It requires retail investments that stations are reluctant to make without guarantees. None of that is materializing. States like California and New York now permit E15, but these decisions were framed as cost and supply flexibilities rather than a new energy direction. Ethanol sits in these states as an accepted part of the gasoline era, not a central element of long term climate policy. In markets that matter most for future trends the direction is clear. The strategic focus is electrification.

California and New York are often treated as outliers in national conversations. They are not outliers. They are lead indicators in vehicle transition. California’s advanced clean cars policy will push new car sales toward 100% zero emission by 2035. New York has adopted the same path. These are affluent states with large populations and lots of cars. Higher ethanol blends in these states amount to small adjustments on the margins of a system that is already pivoting toward EVs. As EV shares rise in coastal states, gasoline consumption falls in absolute terms. Even if some drivers hold on to older vehicles for longer, the weight of new sales changes the slope of long term demand. These states represent enough vehicles that their choices influence national averages. Ethanol fits into their near term fuel mix, but it is not shaping their long term direction.

Export markets, something that grew in recent years, see similar headwinds. In the past few years US ethanol exporters have enjoyed strong demand from Canada, the UK and parts of Southeast Asia. These markets are shifting. Canada is tightening its clean fuel regulations and increasing its EV penetration. The UK and EU have sustainability criteria that limit long term expansion of food based biofuels. India is building a domestic ethanol industry using sugarcane and grain feedstocks. Brazil is expanding corn ethanol capacity of its own. OECD and FAO analyses project that most future global ethanol growth will be met domestically rather than through imports. They also project that total global ethanol trade will remain only a small fraction of production. Export contraction is more likely than export growth, and the rest of the world is moving faster to EVs and now, with Trump’s tariffs, moving away from dependency on US imports.

The ethanol to jet pathway appeared to be the most promising new outlet, but it depends heavily on regulatory certainty. Alcohol to jet fuel can meet ASTM standards and blend seamlessly with petroleum jet. Airlines are interested in any supply that can help them meet long term climate pledges. The economics are fragile. Production costs remain higher than petroleum jet. Carbon intensity scoring determines eligibility for tax credits, and it requires both farming changes and capture and sequestration of CO2 from fermenters to achieve sufficiently low intensity. Those credits require stable policy. The removal of the sustainable aviation fuel bonus credit at the end of 2025 under Trump omnibus bill shifted the economics significantly. The reduction from a potential $1.75 a gallon credit to a $1.00 credit cut the margin for most proposed projects. Developers now face a shorter policy horizon, more uncertainty and capital markets that are increasingly sensitive to policy volatility. Some high profile projects have already stalled or been rescoped. Ethanol to jet remains a possible growth area but it is not a firm foundation for the entire industry.

In other work on aviation I have projected that global passenger and cargo demand will not keep rising on historic 4% annual curves, but will flatten as China’s growth slows, remote work persists and population peaks. In that scenario fossil kerosene peaks around 2030 below 2019 levels and then declines over the rest of the century as batteries and biofuels take over most of the energy demand for flights. Electric flight will be cheaper, 1,000 km hybrid electric turboprop ranges mostly on batteries viable, while international flights with sustainable aviation fuels will be more expensive. While the USA has the highest passenger kilometers per resident the world by a hefty margin, 60% to 70% are in the range to be electrified, and ticket price differential will favor those flights with more traffic. Globally, high speed rail is removing passengers from airplane seats, and global population growth is already slowing, with the flight heavy west seeing aging demographics.

All of these factors will reduce the demand for liquid fuels for aviation. Biokerosenes including ethanol to jet bridge the remaining long haul missions across existing airframes. The result is a long tail of liquid fuel use concentrated almost entirely in intercontinental aviation by 2100, with short haul and regional services fully electrified and many small airports revived as electric regional mobility hubs.

I have also argued that personal transportation in the United States is uniquely hard to decarbonize compared to Europe or China because of structural choices made after World War II. Cheap oil, racialized planning and deliberate dispersion policies pushed people into very low density suburbs and weakened passenger rail so thoroughly that Americans now rely on very large cars and frequent domestic flights for basic mobility. Cars and light trucks account for well over half of US transport emissions and road vehicles of all sizes contribute more than 80% of the sector total, yet the country still lags peers on EV adoption and transit investment.

That combination of extreme sprawl, large vehicles, weak rail and entrenched highway infrastructure means the United States has to push harder on both electrification and urban form just to get to the starting line that other rich countries are already standing on. It also means that in the United States, liquid fuels for cars and aviation stay in the picture longer than they would in a denser, rail oriented system, which is one more reason to expect corn ethanol and other biofuels to face a long, messy transition instead of a clean break. But it doesn’t mean that electrification won’t eat internal combustion fuel demand for lunch, it just means it will be a more leisurely meal.

Marine fuels are sometimes presented as a major opportunity, but here too the outlook is not for growth and ethanol is not the molecule of choice. Starting with demand, 40% of all shipping tonnage is of fossil fuels, and that is in structural decline. Another 15% is raw iron ore, usually steaming to the same ports coal is headed to. That too is in structural decline with renewable electricity based derusting of iron ore to make iron much more viable nearer to coal mines, increasing the value while reducing the tonnage of exports. Global steel demand is also in decline, as China has finished the massive infrastructure boom and is entering a lower maintenance cycle as the developed world did in the second half of the 20th Century. Other countries have access to cheap software and mass timber that significantly reduces steel demand in new buildings, and aren’t going to be building the massive factors, heavy industry and ports that China did. Structurally, 55% of total shipping tonnage is in decline.

Further, electrification is coming for shipping as well. 700 unit container ships with swappable containerized batteries are servicing 1,000 km routes on the Yangtze in China. 2,100 passenger fully electric ferries are on order and being tested in the water already. Hybridization of ocean going ships is almost inevitable as the economics of dirt cheap batteries, clean and inexpensive electrons, and much more costly biofuels radically alter current assumptions. The combination results in much less shipping fuel in the future than today. It’s not a growth market looking in desperation for ethanol.

US corn ethanol rhetoric points to large shipping companies experimenting with multi fuel blends that include ethanol. The global shipping sector will use enormous amounts of fuel even with declines and small blend shares imply large potential ethanol volumes. The caveat is that shipping is already moving toward biomethanol and electrification. Those energy carriers offer better energy density or simpler handling and are aligned with long term zero carbon strategies. Trials that include ethanol are exploratory. There is no regulatory anchor for ethanol in shipping comparable to the mandates in road transport in the early 2000s. There is also a competitive disadvantage. Sugarcane ethanol from more tropical regions has a lower carbon intensity than US corn ethanol and fits more comfortably within international carbon accounting. Marine fuels might absorb some gallons, but they do not plausibly absorb the multi billion gallon gap created by declining road fuel use.

Chemical feedstocks are a real but limited opportunity. Ethanol can serve as a platform for ethylene, acetic acid and other industrial chemicals. Some companies in Brazil already operate this way at commercial scale. These markets value carbon intensity, traceability and stable supply. They do not require the volumes that road transport does. Even optimistic scenarios for ethanol based chemicals only absorb one or two billion gallons. The gap between that figure and current fuel use is too large to bridge.

A useful way to think about the next twenty years is through scenario analysis. In a reference case based on current federal policy and modest EV adoption, ethanol production holds roughly flat. Blend rates climb slightly. Exports remain steady. SAF adds a small amount of extra demand. The industry looks a lot like today with slightly more pressure at the margins. In a moderate case, EV adoption accelerates in line with global patterns. Gasoline demand falls 30% to 40%. Blend rates rise toward E15 but go no further. Exports plateau. SAF struggles with policy instability. Ethanol production falls 20% to 35%. In a high transition case, EVs scale quickly across the United States, coastal states accelerate their mandates and global automotive supply chains deliver lower cost EVs faster than expected. Export markets build domestic production. SAF policy remains unstable. Ethanol production falls on the order of 40% to 50%. None of these numbers are precise forecasts, but they describe reasonable envelopes for planning.

The regional economic effects of even a moderate contraction will be significant. Ethanol plants anchor many rural communities. They form part of the basis that supports grain handlers, trucking firms and equipment dealers. A reduction in ethanol demand reduces local corn prices and affects land values. Farmers will shift into other crops or adjust rotations but that takes time. Some ethanol plants will diversify into higher value co products like protein concentrates or biochemicals. Others will close or consolidate. The transition will not be even across the Midwest. Plants with access to low carbon electricity, carbon capture pathways or diversified product streams will adapt more readily. Plants with high operating costs or limited access to low carbon inputs will struggle.

Most of the communities built around corn-ethanol plants are not affluent today. They are generally stable, middle-income rural towns whose economies depend on agriculture, a few industrial anchors and a small service base. Ethanol plants raise local incomes relative to purely farming counties because they add processing jobs, support a network of trucking, maintenance and engineering firms and strengthen corn prices within a 30 to 60 mile radius. That effect improves household earnings and local tax revenue, but it does not turn these areas into high-income regions. Many of the counties with the heaviest ethanol concentration still have below-average median household incomes compared to national figures, lower population growth and limited economic diversification. Ethanol plants provide stability rather than affluence, which is why the prospect of long-term demand decline matters so much. If the primary industrial buyer in an already thin local economy begins to shrink, the communities around it have little buffer and fewer alternative employers to absorb the shift. The combination has the potential to mean a further rural hollowing out and depopulation.

There is a credible, long-run possibility that declining corn ethanol demand could open the door to large scale rewilding in parts of the Midwest, but it would occur unevenly without strong federal and state guidance, and only under certain economic conditions. A significant share of the land used for continuous corn today is not prime cropland. Much of it sits on marginal soils, areas prone to erosion, floodplains, former prairie that was brought under cultivation during the ethanol boom, or regions where profitability depends on high fertilizer inputs and steady local buyers. When an ethanol plant closes or reduces intake by half, the weakest ground becomes hard to justify financially. Farmers faced with lower local corn prices, higher transport costs to reach distant markets, and lower returns per acre often transition marginal parcels first. That transition can take the form of reduced tillage, grassland restoration, enrollment in conservation programs or leasing land to wildlife agencies or private conservation groups. Federal conservation programs already have waiting lists in many states, and a sustained decline in corn demand would increase interest in enrolling acres that no longer generate reliable profits.

Rewilding does not mean a full return to tallgrass prairie across entire counties. It usually begins with patches of land taken out of annual row cropping and converted to mixed grasses, wetlands or riparian buffers. Over time, these areas provide habitat, improve water quality and reduce nutrient runoff. In regions with chronic flood risks or groundwater stress, reverting portions of corn acreage to natural cover can also ease public infrastructure costs. Some landowners will see value in carbon markets if those markets become more credible. Others will partner with conservation organizations that combine ecological restoration with recreational or grazing leases. There will still be strong agricultural production on the best land, but the overall mosaic shifts. A sustained 40% to 50% decline in ethanol demand over twenty years would gradually release millions of acres from strict commodity production pressure, and a portion of those acres would flow into rewilding because it becomes the most rational economic choice for land that cannot compete well in a post ethanol landscape.

There are viable paths forward for many producers. Some will invest in carbon capture to lower their fuel’s measured carbon intensity. Some will pursue biorefinery strategies that treat ethanol as one output in a broader product mix. Others will explore partnerships in chemicals, specialty proteins or green ammonia. The industry that emerges will be leaner and more varied than the one that grew under the Renewable Fuel Standard. The skill sets, infrastructure and experience inside these companies are valuable in new energy and materials markets. The question is how fast they can pivot.

The large scale conditions that supported corn ethanol for two decades are changing. The global automotive industry is electrifying. Regulatory frameworks in major importing countries are turning toward zero emission vehicles and low carbon fuels with strict sustainability criteria. Domestic gasoline demand is softening in ways that will continue and likely accelerate. The policy foundation for ethanol to jet remains unstable. These factors add up to a long term environment where a contraction of the US corn ethanol sector is more plausible than continued growth. A decline of 20% to 50% is a reasonable planning range depending on how quickly EVs scale and how successfully producers diversify. The next twenty years will test the industry’s ability to adapt to a world where road fuels are no longer the primary engine of energy demand.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ChatGPT-Image-Nov-29-2025-10_29_06-AM-800x445.png,N,,2025-11-29 19:56:11.037126

The European Union has committed a €3 billion investment package to accelerate the commercial scale-up of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This public capital directly addresses the high initial cost and infrastructure gap, de-risking the Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) for new production facilities, especially those using the Power-to-Liquid (e-fuels) pathway. This intervention secures the long-term supply chain for aviation, with the most important data point being that the funding is explicitly designed to help meet the binding 70% SAF blending mandate by 2050.

Context

The core question for the aviation and energy sectors has been whether the industry can meet its aggressive fuel mandates without a massive public capital infusion to bridge the cost and production gap. The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation created a clear demand signal, but the high capital expenditure for new plants and the cost premium of SAF over conventional jet fuel had stalled the necessary private investment to scale production. Informed professionals were waiting for a mechanism to convert policy risk into commercial certainty.

Analysis

This development is a direct policy-to-market intervention. The cause is the binding ReFuelEU mandate, which created a future demand that the current supply chain cannot meet. The effect is the €3 billion funding, which acts as the necessary mechanism to build that supply.

Manufacturers are now expected to accelerate Final Investment Decisions on new SAF plants, particularly those focused on advanced biofuels and synthetic e-fuels. Think of this funding like a down payment on a new factory, immediately improving the risk-return profile for private investors.

Outlook

This development implies a major acceleration in the industrial build-out of synthetic fuel capacity. The simple thing to watch for next is the announcement of Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) for large-scale SAF production facilities, especially those focused on the synthetic e-fuel pathway. A sustained flow of FIDs and new, long-term offtake agreements between airlines and SAF producers will confirm that the public capital has successfully de-risked the market and that the industrial transition is now in motion.",https://news.sustainability-directory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sustainable-Urban-Mobility-Public-Transit-Decarbonization-Green-Infrastructure-Ecological-Transition-Hydrological-Cycle.jpeg,N,,2025-11-30 04:56:31.328628

Several carriers suspended flights in response, triggering Venezuela’s National Institute of Civil Aviation (INAC) to revoke their operating permits, a decisive step in asserting control over Venezuela airspace.

Airspace Control as a Strategic Tool

On November 21, 2025, the U.S. FAA issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) warning of a “potentially hazardous situation” in Venezuelan airspace, citing increased military readiness, GPS interference, and U.S. deployments in the Caribbean targeting alleged drug trafficking. In response, several international carriers including Iberia, TAP Air Portugal, Turkish Airlines, Avianca, LATAM, and Gol temporarily suspended flights to Caracas (more details here).

Venezuela’s National Institute of Civil Aviation (INAC) responded by issuing a 48-hour ultimatum for the carriers to resume service. When the deadline passed without the airlines complying, INAC revoked their operating rights. Venezuela’s government accused the airlines of joining “actions of state terrorism promoted by the United States”

President Nicolás Maduro framed the Venezuela aviation ban as a demonstration of sovereignty. In a televised address, he declared Venezuela “invincible,” signalling to both domestic and international audiences that foreign carriers would not dictate operations within Venezuelan airspace. The government’s measures reflect how aviation is used as political leverage in ongoing negotiations with the U.S.

The move follows other actions in 2025, including public references to a “prolonged resistance” strategy. By grounding airlines and controlling flight routes, Venezuela ensures that Venezuela airline restrictions 2025 directly influence international mobility while amplifying its political stance.

Venezuela-US mounting Tensions

The airline ban comes amid growing U.S.-Venezuela tensions. The U.S. has increased its military presence in the Caribbean, assembling its largest military presence in the Caribbean since the 1989 invasion of Panama. This build-up, part of “Operation Southern Spear,” began in August 2025 with the deployment of the USS Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group, and was bolstered in November by the arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group.

Sanctions and legal measures remain in place: U.S. indictments of senior Venezuelan officials, including Maduro, and a $50 million bounty on the president, continue to escalate pressures. These actions prompted the FAA advisory, which in turn sparked the Venezuela aviation ban and broader Venezuela airline restrictions 2025.

Aviation at the Center of the Standoff

After major international airlines voluntarily suspended flights to Venezuela following a U.S. safety warning, Venezuela retaliated by revoking their operating permits, demonstrating how aviation is used as a tool of political leverage. The decisions highlight the key strategic power commercial aviation can have in international diplomacy: controlling flight operations can send messages and enforce pressure without deploying hard military power.

Lo dice Gianfranco Battisti, amministratore delegato di Gesap, la società di gestione dell’aeroporto di Palermo, che in questi giorni ha partecipato a Bologna agli stati generali della ripartenza, portando la visione strategica dello scalo palermitano sui temi della transizione ecologica e dell’innovazione digitale. Nel suo intervento, Battisti ha portato come esempio la pianificazione del piano industriale dello scalo aereo palermitano, che verrà definito nel primo semestre del 2026, dove si punterà molto sull’innovazione ambientale. “La sostenibilità non è più un’opzione ma è un fattore competitivo – ha detto il manager – Per questo motivo stiamo pianificando infrastrutture dedicate allo stoccaggio e alla distribuzione del carburante sostenibile in aviazione (sustainable aviation fuel – Saf), ai sistemi di miscelazione, partnership industriali con produttori e compagnie aeree. Con il Saf si possono ridurre fino all’80% le emissioni degli aeromobili. Accanto al Saf, stanno maturando e-fuels e biocarburanti avanzati che potenzieranno ulteriormente la decarbonizzazione. Poi c’è la Digitalizzazione – continua Battisti – con l’automazione delle operazioni, manutenzione predittiva, intelligenza artificiale per la sicurezza e la gestione integrata dello scalo. Ritengo che un aeroporto che digitalizza è un aeroporto che riduce consumi, emissioni e costi”.

Ma la tecnologia da sola non basta se non crescono e si evolvono anche le competenze delle risorse umane. “Servono academy interne, partnership con università e nuove tecnologie, programmi di formazione su Saf, e-fuels. Un ecosistema forte si costruisce sulle persone, non solo sulle infrastrutture – continua Battisti – Quando un aeroporto diventa un laboratorio operativo, cosa sulla quale ci stiamo muovendo, e non rimane un progetto sulla carta ma un luogo dove la transizione si realizza davvero, accadono in genere tre cose immediate: arrivano capitali, arrivano nuove rotte, arrivano nuove competenze.

The move follows as reported by BBC, the discovery that intense solar radiation could corrupt data linked to flight control systems, a risk that Airbus says requires a swift software update.

According to the BBC, more airlines are now reporting potential disruptions as Airbus begins recalling affected aircraft for the update. The recall applies to roughly 6,000 planes globally, nearly half of Airbus’s fleet, making it, as BBC’s notes, “a very unusual situation”.

Air India & Indico issue travel advisories

Air India and IndiGo have issued warnings of longer turnaround times and possible delays, according to The Mint. The publication reported that both airlines have advised passengers to check flight status before heading to the airport, noting that operations may be affected as Airbus’s directive is implemented. “The software/hardware realignment on part of our fleet will lead to delayed operations,” Air India said in a post on X, adding that it regretted any inconvenience caused to passengers.

Other airlines have also responded: American Airlines said about 340 of its planes are affected and warned of “some operational delays” but expects most updates to be completed today or tomorrow. Delta Airlines said it will comply with Airbus’s instruction and expects the impact to be “limited”. London Heathrow said its operations remain unaffected, while Gatwick Airport expects some disruption.

Airbus says the majority of affected aircraft only require a software installation, normally a three-hour process. But around 900 older planes will need computer hardware replaced and will not be allowed to carry passengers until that is done. Availability of parts remains a concern, and it is currently unclear whether replacements can be sourced in time.

BBC reported that the software directive primarily targets the A320 family, which Airbus describes as the “aircraft family of choice for airlines around the world.” These planes can fly up to 4,700 nautical miles (8,700 km) and seat between 120 and 244 passengers. The A320 also flies using 50% sustainable aviation fuel, a figure Airbus hopes to raise to 100% by 2030.

The aircraft features advanced turbofan engines that offer 20% lower fuel burn compared with previous generations, one reason why it remains central to commercial fleets worldwide. With thousands of aircraft grounded or awaiting updates, passengers across continents have been urged to monitor flight schedules and allow extra time at airports.",https://greaterkashmir.imagibyte.sortdcdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Airport-KL-e1747033317387.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 14:57:06.668958

In Central Asia, Siddiqui emphasized, such mechanisms do not yet exist.
Meanwhile, Uzbekistan has taken a significant step toward sustainable aviation fuel production.

This was stated by Rizwan Siddiqui, IATA Country Manager for Central Asia, during a discussion at the Central Asia Aviation Summit in Tashkent. He emphasized that without government incentives and a regulatory framework, the region risks missing a crucial stage in the global transformation of the aviation industry.

According to Siddiqui, SAF currently accounts for about 0.7 percent of global aviation fuel — a figure that must rise to 65 percent by 2050 under the industry’s commitments to achieve net-zero emissions. Achieving this will require US$1.5 trillion in investments and the large-scale construction of production facilities.

However, as the IATA representative noted, investors expect transparent rules, incentive mechanisms, and long-term political guarantees from governments.

Siddiqui highlighted the experience of the United States and the European Union, where governments have already implemented support measures for SAF producers. In the U.S., the creation of production capacity was made possible through tax benefits and direct incentives. In the EU, mandatory SAF usage requirements have been introduced: by 2025, European airports must ensure at least 2 percent of fuel is sustainable. A similar approach is emerging in Asia: Singapore is introducing a flight-distance–based tax, and Malaysia requires airlines to supply a minimum of 1 percent SAF in refueling operations.

In Central Asia, Siddiqui emphasized, such mechanisms do not yet exist. Kazakhstan is the only country in the region to have joined the global ICAO initiative, CORSIA, which imposes obligations for carbon offsetting. Uzbekistan, he said, continues to study the possibilities of joining, but its regulatory framework is not yet in place. Nonetheless, initial industry initiatives are appearing in Kazakhstan: companies LanzaJet and KazMunayGas are considering building an SAF production facility in Kostanay Region.

The absence of subsidies, investment incentives, and a clear governmental position continues to hinder the development of sustainable fuels in the region. “So far, no Central Asian country has announced either mandates or financial support measures,” Siddiqui noted.

He stressed that the cost of SAF remains a key barrier: one ton of sustainable fuel currently costs US$2,000–2,500, whereas conventional aviation fuel costs about US$750 per ton. Prices can only decrease with large-scale construction of production facilities, which is impossible without government intervention.

Siddiqui also urged countries in the region to more actively study and implement international emissions regulatory tools, noting that many aviation regulators in Central Asia still do not fully understand the scale and importance of transitioning to green technologies. “CORSIA is not a declaration but a tool for implementation. And it is the implementation, not the signing, that is the most challenging part,” he said.

Meanwhile, Uzbekistan has taken a significant step toward sustainable aviation fuel production. Allied Biofuels FE LLC Uzbekistan signed an agreement with the Khorezm regional government regarding land and water resources for the implementation of a biorefinery complex in Tuproqqalin District. The investment is estimated at US$5.9 billion.

The project envisages the construction of the first fully integrated zero-emission aviation fuel plant in Central Asia. The facility will be capable of producing 382,000 tons of SAF annually, 152,000 tons of e-SAF (electro-synthetic fuel), and 11,000 tons of “green” diesel powered by 2 GW PEM electrolyzers.

The initiative aims to establish a climate-oriented aviation fuel supply chain in Uzbekistan and strengthen Khorezm Region’s role as a hub for sustainable energy and industrial innovation.",https://www.uzdaily.uz/media/filer_public/3b/8d/3b8dd3c5-bb12-4734-849c-4e2b06278ff3/iata_29-11-2.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 16:56:46.863520

Indian carriers issue advisories

Air India and IndiGo have warned of longer turnaround times and possible delays. Both airlines urged passengers to check their flight status before leaving for the airport. Air India said the software and hardware adjustments required for part of its fleet will slow operations and apologised for the inconvenience.

Other global carriers are taking similar steps. American Airlines said about 340 of its planes are affected and expects “some operational delays,” though most updates should be wrapped up within a day or two. Delta Airlines expects only limited impact. London Heathrow reported normal operations, while Gatwick Airport flagged potential disruption.

Most aircraft will need only a software installation, a process that generally takes about three hours. Older jets — roughly 900 of them — require a hardware replacement and cannot carry passengers until that work is completed. The availability of parts remains uncertain, raising concerns about how long some planes may remain grounded.

The directive mainly affects the A320 family, a core part of many global fleets. These aircraft typically carry between 120 and 244 passengers and can fly up to 4,700 nautical miles. They are also certified to run on 50 percent sustainable aviation fuel, with plans to eventually reach full compatibility.

LanzaJet, a leading U.S. sustainable fuel innovator, has announced a major breakthrough: the successful production of jet fuel made from ethanol at its Freedom Pines Fuels plant in Soperton, Georgia. This achievement marks the world’s first commercial-scale output of ethanol-derived jet fuel, delivering a renewable, non-petroleum aviation fuel that works seamlessly with today’s aircraft and fueling infrastructure. Backed by more than 15 years of research and development, the milestone validates LanzaJet’s proprietary Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology, a platform capable of converting a wide range of sustainable feedstocks—including agricultural waste, purpose-grown energy crops, municipal solid waste, and captured carbon—into drop-in aviation fuel. LanzaJet highlights this advancement as a major step forward for farmers, biofuels producers, aviation stakeholders, and climate-focused innovators. “This achievement represents the culmination of 15 years of research, collaboration, investment, and scale-up—and it proves ethanol can be transformed into jet fuel at true commercial scale,” the company stated.

Why ethanol matters: a scalable solution for SAF production

Aviation faces urgent pressure to decarbonize, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) remains the only scalable near-term solution for reducing emissions from long-haul flights. However, the current dominant SAF pathway—HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids)—depends heavily on limited feedstocks such as used cooking oil and waste fats. With global demand rising, these resources are quickly being constrained. LanzaJet’s ATJ pathway offers a critical alternative by leveraging widely available ethanol. Through a continuous catalytic conversion process, ethanol is transformed into Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK) via: • Dehydration – converting ethanol into ethylene • Oligomerization – building longer hydrocarbon chains • Hydrogenation/Hydrotreating – refining chains into kerosene-range molecules The result is a fully certified SAF compatible with existing turbines, pipelines, and airport systems. CEO Jimmy Samartzis noted, “This milestone is a major win for global aviation and a sign of what’s possible for the industry’s future.” According to LanzaJet, ATJ is the most commercially ready, scalable SAF solution developed in the past decade, supporting energy security, domestic fuel production, and growth in agricultural economies.

Higher-quality fuel with lower emissions

The Freedom Pines Fuels facility stands as a first-of-its-kind (FOAK) integrated biorefinery, representing more than $300 million in investment. The plant incorporates cutting-edge technologies such as: • Technip Energies’ Hummingbird system (Ethanol-to-Ethylene) • A combined DOE/LanzaTech Oligomerization process By sourcing from a diverse blend of sustainable feedstocks, the plant delivers SAF with substantially lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil-based jet fuel. When blended with Jet A-1, the resulting fuel meets all international aviation standards, offering a drop-in solution for airlines worldwide. LanzaJet reports that its SAF delivers higher energy density than conventional Jet-A, providing a superior-quality fuel while reducing environmental impact. Beyond its climate benefits, the Freedom Pines facility is generating economic value in rural Georgia—creating hundreds of construction jobs and supporting more than 65 permanent direct and indirect jobs in Treutlen County.

Global deployment and the road to net zero aviation

LanzaJet is scaling its ATJ technology worldwide, with projects already underway across: • United States • Australia • Japan • India • United Kingdom • Colombia • European Union • Middle East • Kazakhstan As the aviation sector targets Net Zero by 2050, LanzaJet’s success demonstrates that the technologies needed to accelerate deep decarbonization are not theoretical—they exist today.",,N,,2025-11-29 10:56:50.066521

According to IATA, the regulation’s shortcomings have been evident for years. European governments attempted to address these in June, when the European Council backed amendments designed to safeguard connectivity and strengthen the competitiveness of European aviation.

Although not perfect, that position aimed for a more balanced framework, notably by increasing the delay thresholds for compensation from three hours to four hours for short-haul flights, and to six hours for long-haul services.

This, IATA said, would reduce incentives for airlines to cancel delayed flights, while aligning with passengers’ clear preference to arrive late rather than not at all.

The Parliament, however, is pushing to scrap these threshold changes and introduce additional obligations, including a right to bring a cabin bag for free.

IATA noted that there is no evidence passengers are asking for such measures, and even less that they are willing to pay higher fares for them.

In its May passenger survey, 72 per cent said they preferred the lowest fare with the option to pay for extra services when needed.

At the same time, 97 per cent reported being satisfied with their most recent flight.

Eurocontrol data also shows that fewer than 1 per cent of flights face delays longer than three hours, meaning the remaining 99 per cent of passengers are funding a compensation scheme that only a small minority ever uses.

IATA argues this makes value for money even more important.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, said the Parliament’s approach effectively “works as a reverse Robin Hood”, adding that “there is no such thing as a ‘free’ bag or ‘free’ compensation thresholds”.

He stressed that “MEPs are imposing things people haven’t asked for, and don’t want to pay for unless they choose to”, noting that passengers would rather pay lower fares in exchange for a less “gold-plated” scheme.

He added that the Council’s position should be upheld to support competitiveness and reflect the calls in last year’s Draghi report for fewer and smarter regulations.

IATA also linked the debate to broader concerns over Europe’s slowing air-connectivity growth. Its research shows that between 2014 and 2024, connectivity grew by only 2.2 per cent a year in France, 2.9 per cent in the Netherlands, and just 0.4 per cent in Germany, trends it says emphasise the need for action to help the industry remain competitive.

This, it argued, includes phasing out passenger taxes that undermine connectivity; Sweden removed its levy in July, and IATA urged others to follow.

It also called for changes to the ReFuelEU “Green Deal” Regulation and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, saying fuel producers should be incentivised to supply affordable sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), while airlines need to benefit from using it.

At present, airlines face a USD 2.9 billion premium for purchasing SAF compared with conventional jet fuel, on top of ETS costs. IATA described the Commission’s recent STIP proposal as a positive signal, although it said concrete action remains to be seen.

Finally, IATA warned that the combination of rising regulatory, environmental and tax-related costs is already undermining the viability of new routes and additional frequencies, ultimately reducing choice for consumers.",https://cyprus-mail.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/plane-513641_1280.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 08:56:12.113755

Similarly, Flynas in Saudi Arabia has begun carrying out software and technical recalibrations across part of its A320 fleet.","DUBAI – in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and worldwide are navigating widespread operational checks prompted by an directive impacting the A320 family, one of the world’s most widely used aircraft types.

The precautionary move follows concerns about a potential flight-control issue linked to intense solar radiation. Airlines, regulators, and passengers across continents are monitoring the developments, with up to 6,000 jets worldwide requiring software or hardware modifications.

While some disruptions are expected, UAE carriers have responded quickly, prioritising safety and operational continuity.

Airbus issued the directive on Friday, calling for an immediate software update across the A320 fleet. The update affects aircraft equipped with a specific flight-control component known as the Elevator Aileron Computer (ELAC). The precautionary order is being treated with urgency by operators across the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and the United States. Most jets will receive a software update taking approximately three hours, while around 900 older aircraft will require hardware replacement, temporarily grounding affected planes.

Airline responses

UAE-based confirmed it has initiated mandatory software and technical upgrades across its affected A320 aircraft. The Sharjah-based budget carrier operates 67 A320 family aircraft through its operations in Sharjah and Abu Dhabi, making it one of the UAE’s largest operators of the model.

“We confirm that we have received the directive issued by Airbus concerning the A320 aircraft type operated by airlines worldwide, which requires a number of aircraft to undergo specific software and technical updates,” a spokesperson said. The airline assured travellers that measures were being implemented across the impacted fleet and that any schedule adjustments would be communicated directly to affected passengers. “We are working to ensure minimal impact on our customers. In the event of any schedule adjustments, affected passengers will be notified directly.”

Air Arabia expressed regret for any inconvenience, emphasising its commitment to the highest levels of safety.

Meanwhile, Airways announced that its A320 operations have already returned to a normal schedule after completing the required update swiftly. The Abu Dhabi-based airline credited its operational teams for minimising disruption, especially during one of the busiest travel periods at Zayed International Airport ahead of the long weekend.

“Thanks to the exceptional efforts of our operational and technical teams, the update was completed quickly and with minimal disruption,” Etihad said. The carrier highlighted the importance of passenger understanding and reaffirmed that safety remains the airline’s top priority.

According to aviation data and analytics firm Cirium, UAE airlines collectively operate 106 Airbus A320-family aircraft, a significant portion of the regional fleet. The A320 is a preferred model globally, known for its fuel efficiency, versatility, and range of up to 4,700 nautical miles. Globally, around half of Airbus’s total commercial fleet—some 6,000 aircraft—fall under the recall directive.

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) explained that intense solar radiation may, in rare cases, affect data used by the ELAC system, potentially leading to uncommanded movement of the aircraft’s control surfaces. While no major accidents have been directly attributed to the issue, the advisory was issued under safety precaution guidelines.

Global response

Carriers across Europe, Asia, and North America have begun fleet assessments to determine the number of affected aircraft. In , operators including IndiGo, Air India, and Air India Express are implementing software and hardware realignments across around 200–250 aircraft, according to aviation authorities. Air India confirmed that over 40 per cent of its affected fleet has already been updated, with no flight cancellations reported so far. However, travellers have been advised to expect possible delays.

Similarly, Flynas in Saudi Arabia has begun carrying out software and technical recalibrations across part of its A320 fleet. The airline warned of longer turnaround times on a limited number of flights and said that any affected passengers would be contacted via SMS or email.

In Japan, All Nippon Airways (ANA) reported the cancellation of 65 domestic flights. The carrier confirmed that 34 of its A320-family aircraft required the update, affecting thousands of passengers travelling in and out of Haneda Airport in Tokyo. Japan Airlines, however, confirmed its fleet was unaffected.

Impact on airports

In the United Kingdom, Gatwick Airport reported that approximately 80 aircraft were affected. While Heathrow confirmed no major operational impact, airlines are coordinating parking and overnight update schedules to minimise disruption.

In the United States, American Airlines reported that 340 aircraft would undergo inspection and update, with many expected to be completed by Saturday. Delta said fewer than 50 of its A321neo aircraft were affected and anticipates limited disruption. United Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines said their fleets were unaffected.

Technical fixes

The required repair process primarily involves reverting aircraft systems to earlier software versions. The ELAC units receive a software patch to safeguard against corrupted flight-control data. For the older aircraft requiring hardware replacement, the process is more complex and may involve transporting aircraft to maintenance facilities. Ferry flights, where aircraft are flown without passengers to maintenance hubs, are permitted under regulated safety guidelines.

Regulatory oversight

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in India has issued an airworthiness directive banning the operation of certain A320-family aircraft without the mandated modification. “No person shall operate any aircraft that falls under the applicability of this mandatory modification except those complying with the requirements,” the order said.

The directive listed multiple Airbus models, including A319, A320 ceos and neos, and A321 variants, underscoring the scale of the global impact.

Passenger advisory

As airlines work to implement the updates, passengers are advised to monitor notifications, maintain updated contact details, and check flight statuses before travelling to the airport. Carriers have reiterated that no major safety incidents have been linked to the issue and that the directive is precautionary.

The software anomaly came into focus after a JetBlue A320 experienced a sudden drop in altitude during a flight from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, in late October. The aircraft made an emergency landing in Tampa, Florida, with minor injuries reported for 15 passengers. The investigation pointed to potential data corruption within the ELAC system, prompting Airbus and EASA to issue a global directive.

Airbus describes the A320 family as the “aircraft of choice for airlines around the world.” With seating for 120 to 244 passengers, modern A320 aircraft already operate partially using sustainable aviation fuel, with Airbus targeting 100 per cent use by 2030. Its advanced turbofan engines offer up to 20 per cent reductions in fuel burn compared with earlier models.

As airlines continue to implement updates, global regulators reiterate that safety remains the absolute priority of the aviation industry, with operational continuity managed closely alongside compliance efforts.",https://www.travelsdubai.com/digital_images/large/2025-11-29/uae-travel-alert-airlines-respond-global-airbus-a320-recall-disruption-1764401612-7445.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 15:56:13.796827

During a multi-stakeholder validation workshop held in Addis Ababa’s Skylight Hotel on Thursday November 27, experts presenting the feasibility study told officials and industry representatives that Ethiopia could produce low-carbon aviation fuel using local agricultural crops, municipal waste, sugar byproducts and renewable energy sources.

The findings were presented to senior representatives from the ministries of Transport and Logistics, Agriculture, the Civil Aviation Authority, universities and private investors during a final validation workshop attended by international consultants and donors, including the European Union, which funded the study through the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)

The feasibility study launched in December 2024 with a national workshop and followed by field consultations and a March 2025 stakeholder conference, where Ethiopian officials engaged with technical experts to review data and evaluate business readiness for domestic SAF production.

The research built on three previous studies including a 2019 WWF-South Africa assessment and two Ethiopian roadmap and feasibility studies conducted in 2021 and 2022, which first identified Ethiopian mustard as a viable aviation fuel crop.

Lead consultant John McKechnie stated that Ethiopia was selected for deeper analysis because of its agricultural base, expanding industrial capacity and unexploited renewable energy resources, which together position the country strategically in Africa’s energy transition.

Researchers confirmed that more than 30 million hectares of Ethiopian land are suitable for cultivating Ethiopian mustard without interfering with food production, making it one of the most promising non-food crops identified for sustainable aviation fuel feedstock.

Field trials already show the crop can be produced at scale, though further research is required to determine how national production can be expanded to serve commercial aviation demand.

Officials acknowledged challenges related to logistics and supply chains, noting that Ethiopia’s farmers are geographically dispersed and current transport infrastructure makes bulk feedstock collection difficult.

The study examined multiple production routes including alcohol-to-jet fuel derived from sugar molasses, waste-to-fuel systems using municipal landfill material, and electricity-based fuels derived from renewable sources.

Ethiopia’s sugar sector already has an annual ethanol production capacity of approximately 32.5 million liters, though current output remains constrained due to competition from food and beverage manufacturers willing to pay higher prices.

Municipal waste presented a dual opportunity allowing the country to simultaneously address urban waste problems while generating clean aviation fuel, according to the technical team.

Electricity-based fuel production was identified as one of Ethiopia’s strongest long-term options due to its high renewable energy potential, offering a future route for hydrogen-based synthetic fuel manufacturing.

Power-to-liquid technology is projected to be certified between mid-2026 and late-2026, placing Ethiopia within range of early commercial adoption provided investment mobilization begins promptly.

Consultants acknowledged current market prices for sustainable aviation fuel are roughly double conventional jet fuel rates, though they expect long-term costs to fall once production maturity is achieved.

An international benchmark drawn from India revealed that mandatory aviation fuel blending will begin at one percent in 2027 and rise to five percent by 2030.

Experts warned airlines that regulatory pressure will intensify across international airspace, with compliance becoming unavoidable by 2030 if Ethiopian carriers are to maintain global competitiveness.

The government confirmed the formation of a national technical committee on sustainable aviation fuel and announced plans to establish a project office staffed by aviation and energy specialists in the coming weeks.

Officials stated development partners would be invited to finance the project office and assist in converting research findings into industrial investment programs. Transport Ministry officials reiterated that aviation alone accounts for a large share of global emissions and that Ethiopia has committed to carbon-reduction targets under international climate agreements.",https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ETHIOPIA-READY-TO-GAMBLE-ON-SUSTAINABLE-AVIATION-FUEL.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 04:56:10.333204

The recall of 6,000 planes covers more than half of Airbus' global A320 family fleet, the backbone of Asian short-haul aviation, particularly in China and India where economic growth has brought millions of new travellers into the skies.

Regulators around the world followed the European Union Aviation Safety Agency in directing their carriers to remedy the A320 software problem before resuming flights.

The Airbus recall, issued to 350 operators around the world, appears to be one of the biggest in its 55-year history and comes weeks after the A320 overtook the Boeing 737 as the most-delivered model.

FIX IS SIMPLE BUT NECESSARY

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration told carriers to replace or modify software that controls the elevators and ailerons on A319, A320 and A321 airplanes.

India's aviation regulator said 338 Airbus aircraft in the country were affected by the glitch but said the software reset will be completed by Sunday. The country's largest airline, IndiGo, has completed the software reset on 143 out of 200 aircraft, the regulator said.

Air India, which has 113 impacted aircraft, has completed the reset on 42 aircraft. Both airlines warned of delays on Saturday.

""There isn't any major impact on schedule integrity across our network,"" Air India posted on X. ""However, some of our flights may be slightly delayed or rescheduled.""

Taiwan's Civil Aviation Administration instructed airlines to conduct inspections and maintenance. It estimates that around two-thirds of the 67 A320 and A321 aircraft operated by the island's carriers are affected.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Macao said it had asked Air Macau to address the issue, including rescheduling flights to minimise any disruption to passengers.

ANA Holdings, Japan's biggest airline, cancelled 65 flights on Saturday and warned of more disruption on Sunday.

ANA and its affiliates, such as Peach Aviation, operate the most Airbus A320 jets in Japan. Its chief rival, Japan Airlines, has a mostly Boeing fleet and does not fly the A320. Nationwide, 95 flights were cancelled, according to public broadcaster NHK.

Globally, there are about 11,300 of the single-aisle jets in service, including 6,440 of the core A320. The fix mainly involves reverting to earlier software, and although relatively simple, it must be completed before the planes can fly again.

OCTOBER INCIDENT TRIGGERED RECALL, SOURCES SAY

Jetstar, the budget carrier of Australia's flag carrier Qantas, said some of its flights would be affected by the recall. The Australian Broadcasting Corp reported significant delays at Melbourne airport.

South Korea's Asiana Airlines said it does not expect any significant disruptions to its flight schedule, with only 17 of its aircraft affected by the recall. Its domestic rival, Korean Air, said it was working to get 10 of its jets back into service.

South Korea's Transport Ministry said upgrades to 42 aircraft there were expected to be completed by Sunday morning.

Hong Kong budget carrier HK Express said it had upgraded more than half its affected aircraft and that flight operations were normal.

The world's largest A320 operator, American Airlines, said 340 of its 480 A320 aircraft needed the fix, most of which it expected to complete by Saturday.

U.S. carriers American, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue and United Airlines are among the world's 10 biggest A320-family operators.

Other airlines that said they would do the repairs include Germany's Lufthansa, and Britain-based easyJet.

Colombian carrier Avianca said the recall affected more than 70% of its fleet, prompting it to close ticket sales for travel dates through December 8.

Industry sources said a sharp loss of altitude on a JetBlue flight from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, on October 30, that injured several passengers had triggered the Airbus recall.

Purpose Behind the Levy The introduction of the green aviation fuel levy aligns with Singapore’s vision of becoming a leader in sustainable aviation.
Singapore is leading sustainable aviation with a revolutionary green fuel levy starting in 2026, ranging from SGD 1 to SGD 41.60, to reduce emissions and promote sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) adoption.
The green aviation fuel levy introduced by Singapore is a bold move toward reducing the aviation industry’s carbon emissions and supporting the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel.","Singapore is the first in the world to implement green fuel levies on air travel. With the new policy, travelers will pay an extra fee which will be determined based on the distance, starting with SGD 1 and going as high as SGD 41.60 for high travel classes. The charge will be used to purchase and promote the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The policy will be in effect by 2026. The goal is to connect the cost of flight travel and the pollution generated. With this, the authorities hope to promote responsibility and flight travel cost related to pollution.

In a significant step toward environmental sustainability, Singapore has announced the introduction of a green aviation fuel levy, which will come into effect from 2026. This move, set to be applied to air tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights departing Singapore from October 1, 2026, marks a major initiative by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) to reduce the aviation sector’s carbon footprint.

Details of the Green Aviation Fuel Levy

The levy aims to promote the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), contributing to Singapore’s goal of achieving a 3% to 5% SAF adoption rate by 2030. To facilitate this transition, passengers will be charged according to the travel class and the distance they are flying. The levy will be added to the cost of air tickets, with charges varying for different regions and classes of service.

For flights within Southeast Asia, economy and premium economy passengers will pay SGD 1 (approximately HKD 5.97), while those flying to Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, and Papua New Guinea will be charged SGD 2.80 (HKD 16.72) in economy class, and SGD 11.20 (HKD 66.86) in premium cabins.

European and Long-Haul Destinations

Passengers traveling to Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific Islands, and New Zealand in economy class will incur a charge of SGD 2.80 (HKD 16.72), while those in premium cabins will pay SGD 25.60 (HKD 152.82). For flights to the Americas, the levy increases to SGD 10.40 (HKD 62.08) for economy passengers and reaches a maximum of SGD 41.60 (HKD 248.34) for premium cabin passengers.

The levy is not applicable for passengers who are merely transiting through Singapore, allowing travelers with layovers to avoid any extra charges. Additionally, for passengers traveling on multi-stop flights, the levy will be calculated based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore, ensuring fair and precise charges.

Purpose Behind the Levy

The introduction of the green aviation fuel levy aligns with Singapore’s vision of becoming a leader in sustainable aviation. As the aviation industry is responsible for a significant portion of global greenhouse gas emissions, the move to incorporate SAF and establish a fuel levy is seen as a necessary step to address environmental concerns while supporting the aviation sector’s long-term sustainability goals.

The funds collected through the levy will be used to support the centralised purchase of SAF, helping airlines transition to greener alternatives without incurring significant financial burden. With global pressure on industries to cut carbon emissions, Singapore’s initiative serves as an example for other nations and the aviation industry as a whole to prioritize sustainability in their operations.

Aviation Industry’s Shift Toward Sustainability

While the aviation sector has traditionally been a high-emission industry, there has been increasing momentum toward reducing its environmental impact. Airlines globally are exploring ways to integrate sustainable fuels into their fleets, with many already committed to reducing their carbon emissions over the coming decades.

The green aviation fuel levy in Singapore is a part of a larger trend in which governments and aviation authorities are encouraging airlines to embrace SAF. As SAF has the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions compared to conventional jet fuel, its widespread adoption is crucial in achieving global climate goals.

Singapore’s commitment to sustainability in aviation comes at a time when many countries are rethinking how their transportation systems can become more environmentally friendly. The green fuel levy, alongside other sustainability initiatives, is likely to be an important element of the country’s broader strategy for reducing its carbon footprint and meeting international environmental targets.

Impact on Air Travelers

For travelers, the introduction of the green fuel levy may initially seem like an additional cost. However, the benefits are far-reaching. Passengers who opt for more eco-conscious travel can feel assured that their contributions are part of a larger effort to support cleaner aviation practices. As the industry moves toward greater reliance on sustainable fuel sources, travelers can look forward to a future where air travel is more aligned with global environmental goals.

The green aviation fuel levy is a crucial step in the ongoing transformation of the aviation industry, as stakeholders—from governments and airlines to passengers—work together to make air travel more sustainable. By directly linking the costs of flying with the environmental impact of each journey, Singapore’s innovative approach paves the way for a greener future in aviation.

Singapore is leading sustainable aviation with a revolutionary green fuel levy starting in 2026, ranging from SGD 1 to SGD 41.60, to reduce emissions and promote sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) adoption. This initiative sets a new standard for eco-friendly air travel.

The green aviation fuel levy introduced by Singapore is a bold move toward reducing the aviation industry’s carbon emissions and supporting the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel. While the levy will add a small charge to air tickets, it will ultimately play a significant role in transforming air travel into a more sustainable and environmentally responsible mode of transportation. This initiative marks a milestone in Singapore’s efforts to lead the world in sustainable aviation practices, setting an example for other nations to follow as they work toward a more sustainable future for the global aviation sector.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Singapore-Green-Aviation-Fuel-Levy-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 03:58:30.300573

Safran Investment Narrative Recap

To be a shareholder in Safran, you need to believe that sustained investment in low-emission and sustainable engine technologies will keep the company at the forefront of aerospace innovation, supporting resilient growth and margin expansion. The Bell 505 SAF test milestone demonstrates progress on ESG initiatives, but for now this achievement does not appear to alter the most important catalyst, strong global air travel demand, or mitigate the biggest short-term risk tied to supply chain disruptions.

One recent announcement that connects closely with this news is Safran's raised guidance for 2025, which forecasts revenue growth in the low teens and an increase in projected operating income. This forward-looking stance supports the view that the company's technology efforts, such as SAF compatibility, may reinforce its competitive position amid rising demand, even as supply chain and integration risks persist.

Yet, unlike the optimism around sustainable engine progress, investors also need to consider the ongoing exposure to supply chain risks...

Safran's outlook anticipates €39.3 billion in revenue and €5.0 billion in earnings by 2028. This projection is based on a 10.2% annual revenue growth rate and an increase in earnings of €0.7 billion from the current €4.3 billion.

The move follows as reported by BBC, the discovery that intense solar radiation could corrupt data linked to flight control systems, a risk that Airbus says requires a swift software update.

According to the BBC, more airlines are now reporting potential disruptions as Airbus begins recalling affected aircraft for the update. The recall applies to roughly 6,000 planes globally, nearly half of Airbus’s fleet, making it, as BBC’s notes, “a very unusual situation”.

Air India & Indico issue travel advisories

Air India and IndiGo have issued warnings of longer turnaround times and possible delays, according to The Mint. The publication reported that both airlines have advised passengers to check flight status before heading to the airport, noting that operations may be affected as Airbus’s directive is implemented. “The software/hardware realignment on part of our fleet will lead to delayed operations,” Air India said in a post on X, adding that it regretted any inconvenience caused to passengers.

Other airlines have also responded: American Airlines said about 340 of its planes are affected and warned of “some operational delays” but expects most updates to be completed today or tomorrow. Delta Airlines said it will comply with Airbus’s instruction and expects the impact to be “limited”. London Heathrow said its operations remain unaffected, while Gatwick Airport expects some disruption.

Airbus says the majority of affected aircraft only require a software installation, normally a three-hour process. But around 900 older planes will need computer hardware replaced and will not be allowed to carry passengers until that is done. Availability of parts remains a concern, and it is currently unclear whether replacements can be sourced in time.

BBC reported that the software directive primarily targets the A320 family, which Airbus describes as the “aircraft family of choice for airlines around the world.” These planes can fly up to 4,700 nautical miles (8,700 km) and seat between 120 and 244 passengers. The A320 also flies using 50% sustainable aviation fuel, a figure Airbus hopes to raise to 100% by 2030.

The aircraft features advanced turbofan engines that offer 20% lower fuel burn compared with previous generations, one reason why it remains central to commercial fleets worldwide. With thousands of aircraft grounded or awaiting updates, passengers across continents have been urged to monitor flight schedules and allow extra time at airports.",https://m.greaterkashmir.com/sortd-service/imaginary/v22-01/jpg/large/high?url=Z3JlYXRlcmthc2htaXItc29ydGQtcHJvLXByb2Qtc29ydGQvbWVkaWE0OWEzYTI5MC1jY2QwLTExZjAtYTVmMy1lNTVmZTM5N2MwYWYuanBn,N,,2025-11-29 03:59:09.098436

But the true giant sits beneath those wings. In 2025, the aircraft with the world’s most powerful commercial engines is the Boeing 777X, powered exclusively by the GE Aerospace GE9X. It is the largest turbofan ever built, the current Guinness World Record holder for thrust, and the technological centerpiece of Boeing’s next-generation flagship.

Understanding why the GE9X stands alone requires comparing it with the engines it surpasses: the GE90 that defined the Boeing 777-300ER era, Rolls-Royce’s trent XWB family on the Airbus A350, and even Rolls-Royce’s future-facing UltraFan demonstrator. Each engine represents a different stage in widebody propulsion, but only one the GE9X combines unprecedented fan size, advanced materials, a record-setting pressure ratio, and efficiency gains that reshape what long-haul aircraft can achieve.

The Engine That Redefined ""Largest Ever Built""

Building on this foundation, the GE9X was designed from the ground up for the Boeing 777X family, and its defining feature is its scale. The engine’s fan measures 134 inches in diameter—wider than the fuselage of a Boeing 737—making it the largest turbofan ever produced. In testing, the GE9X generated 134,300 pounds of thrust, securing an official world record. For day-to-day service it is certified at 110,000 pounds of thrust, which still places it comfortably ahead of any other commercial engine.

That size is backed by a series of aerodynamic and material advances. The fan uses next-generation carbon-fiber composite blades that are thinner and stronger than the GE90’s 22 blades, and the fan case is also composite to keep weight in check. Deeper in the engine, ceramic matrix composites in the turbine section replace traditional metal alloys in some of the hottest zones, allowing higher operating temperatures with less cooling air.

A bypass ratio close to 10:1 the highest ever on a GE widebody engine, turns that physical size into real-world efficiency. More air bypasses the core and is accelerated by the fan, generating a larger share of thrust with less fuel burn. At the same time, the slow-turning, large-diameter fan reduces tip speeds and noise, helping the 777X meet tightening airport and environmental regulations.

How The GE9X Achieves Record-Breaking Efficiency

When passengers watch a Boeing 777X taxi past a terminal window, their attention often goes to its massive 64-meter wingspan and folding wingtips. But the true giant sits beneath those wings. In 2025, the aircraft with the world’s most powerful commercial engines is the Boeing 777X, powered exclusively by the GE Aerospace GE9X. It is the largest turbofan ever built, the current Guinness World Record holder for thrust, and the technological centerpiece of Boeing’s next-generation flagship.

Understanding why the GE9X stands alone requires comparing it with the engines it surpasses: the GE90 that defined the 777-300ER era, Rolls-Royce’s Trent XWB family on the Airbus A350, and even Rolls-Royce’s future-facing UltraFan demonstrator. Each engine represents a different stage in widebody propulsion, but only one the GE9X combines unprecedented fan size, advanced materials, a record-setting pressure ratio, and efficiency gains that reshape what long-haul aircraft can achieve.

Why The Boeing 777X Needed The World's Most Powerful Engine

The 777X is the largest twin-engine passenger aircraft ever developed, aimed at replacing earlier 777s and offering an alternative to very large four-engine jets. Its long composite wings generate exceptional lift and improve cruise performance, but they also demand significant thrust during takeoff, especially at maximum takeoff weights above 351,000 kilograms.

The GE9X provides the performance profile required by the 777X. Its large, slow-rotating fan generates high takeoff thrust while maintaining low noise and drag. As a result, the 777X benefits from strong takeoff capability at heavy weights, improved climb performance in challenging airport conditions, lower fuel consumption on long routes, and reduced operational noise impact.

For airlines, these advantages are more than technical milestones. They shape route economics. The 777X is expected to carry more than 400 passengers on routes competing directly with the Airbus A350-1000 and aging 777-300ER fleets. With the GE9X, Boeing can offer a widebody that combines very high capacity with fuel burn and emissions that fit into stricter regulatory frameworks and long-term sustainability targets.

In simple terms, the 777X needed an engine that could match its ambition on range, payload, and environmental performance. The GE9X was designed specifically to fill that role.

GE9X Vs Rivals: GE90, Trent XWB, And UltraFan

Comparing the GE9X to the GE90 highlights how far widebody engines have progressed in a single generation. The GE90-115B, which powers the 777-300ER, can deliver up to 115,540 pounds of thrust and features a 128-inch-diameter fan. Its bypass ratio sits closer to 9:1, and its overall pressure ratio is around the low-40s, impressive figures for its time, but below what the GE9X achieves.

The GE9X, by contrast, sacrifices a small amount of certified takeoff thrust while focusing on cruise efficiency. With a larger 134-inch fan, a higher bypass ratio, and a 60:1 pressure ratio, it extracts more useful thrust from each kilogram of fuel. In practice, that means lower fuel burn, lower emissions, and quieter operation, even though it is physically larger than the GE90.

Against Rolls-Royce’s Trent XWB-97, used on the Airbus A350-1000, the GE9X plays in a similar thrust class but leans on its bigger fan and higher pressure ratio to achieve its performance targets. The Trent XWB is widely regarded as one of the most efficient widebody engines in service, yet Airbus still has to consider that the GE9X gives the 777X a compelling economic story in the same long-haul market segment.

Looking ahead, Rolls-Royce’s UltraFan demonstrator shows where the next step might come from. It uses an even larger 140-inch geared fan and a 64-megawatt power gearbox, with a design target of a 25% fuel-burn improvement over early Trent engines and full compatibility with 100% sustainable aviation fuel from day one. However, UltraFan remains a testbed. It does not yet power a commercial aircraft and is unlikely to enter service before the early 2030s.

For now, that leaves the GE9X as the only certified commercial engine above 100,000 pounds of thrust and the clear leader in the “monster engine” category.

The GE9X Development Story: Materials, Testing, And Certification

The GE9X did not arrive overnight. GE formally launched the program in 2012 as a clean-sheet successor to the GE90, with the goal of pairing a much larger fan with a more efficient core and advanced materials. Engineers spent years iterating fan shapes, compressor layouts, and cooling schemes before the first full engine ran on a ground test stand in 2016.

Those early tests focused on aerodynamics, thermal management, and system behavior across a wide range of power settings. The program then moved to icing, crosswind, and endurance campaigns to validate real-world robustness. Flight testing started in 2018 on GE’s Boeing 747-400 flying testbed, the only platform large enough to carry a GE9X under one wing.

Not everything went smoothly. Early test results revealed wear in the high-pressure compressor, forcing hardware redesigns and contributing to delays in the overall 777X program timeline. However, the core design proved sound, and the test fleet eventually accumulated around 5,000 hours and 8,000 cycles across multiple engines.

The GE9X received Federal Aviation Administration certification in 2020. Since then, GE has continued endurance testing and ETOPS work so that the engine will be ready for extended over-water operations once the 777X enters service. By the time passengers see the GE9X on revenue flights, it will have already gone through one of the most extensive development regimes of any commercial engine to date.

What Comes Next For The World’s Most Powerful Engine?

In 2025, the GE9X stands unchallenged at the top of the commercial turbofan world. It is the only certified engine above 100,000 pounds of thrust, the size leader in fan diameter, and GE’s most thermally efficient large engine. No rival powerplant currently matches its combination of scale, pressure ratio, materials technology, and real-world test history.

That does not mean it will hold every record forever. UltraFan and other future concepts hint at engines that may surpass the GE9X in fuel efficiency, SAF readiness, and integration with hybrid-electric systems. But those designs still have to prove themselves in the same way the GE9X already has through thousands of hours of testing, certification, and long-term airline operation.

As the Boeing 777X moves closer to commercial service, the GE9X will become a regular sight at major global hubs and a new visual icon of long-haul flying. For most passengers, it will go unnoticed, a quiet, steady presence at the end of a wing. For airlines and engineers, it represents a clear milestone in what high-bypass turbofans can achieve.

In 2025, no engine matches the GE9X. For now, it remains the undisputed king of commercial jet power.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/777x-ge9x.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-29 03:59:13.220885

Brasília Sets the Stage for Brazil’s First Green Hydrogen Mobility Hub

Neoenergia, the Brazilian subsidiary of Iberdrola, and Honda Automóveis do Brasil have unveiled a joint programme to advance green hydrogen solutions for mobility and industrial use, anchoring one of the country’s most significant clean-energy R&D initiatives to date.

The collaboration centres on Neoenergia’s first green hydrogen refuelling station, now under construction in Brazil’s capital. The site forms part of ANEEL’s Research, Development and Innovation Programme, supported by an investment of more than €5 million (over 30 million reais). The station is expected to open in December 2025 and will serve as a testing ground for next-generation transport technologies.

Both companies describe the initiative as a pivotal step in accelerating Brazil’s transition toward low-carbon mobility. “This collaboration reinforces our commitment to innovative solutions that accelerate the electrification and decarbonization of the Brazilian economy. Together with Honda, we are joining forces to develop sustainable technologies that expand business opportunities and consolidate Neoenergia’s leadership in the energy transition,” said Eduardo Capelastegui, CEO of Neoenergia.

Fuel-Cell Vehicles Enter Testing Phase

Honda will deploy two models to the project: the CR-V and the CR-V FCEV, a plug-in hybrid SUV equipped with a hydrogen fuel cell system. The vehicles will undergo six months of technical testing to evaluate refuelling performance, driving behaviour, and the operational conditions required to scale hydrogen-based transport in Brazil’s urban environments.

The programme will extend beyond vehicle trials. Honda and Neoenergia will jointly conduct feasibility studies covering hydrogen production, logistics, storage, and new industrial applications, building a cross-sector platform for potential future pilots.

For Honda, which has spent more than 30 years developing hydrogen technologies, Brazil represents fertile ground. “We are very excited to begin this strategic collaboration with Neoenergia in Brazil, a country that has all the conditions to be a world leader in the development of Green Hydrogen,” said Arata Ichinose, CEO of Honda Automóveis do Brasil. “With more than three decades of experience and research in this field, we believe that initiatives like this are fundamental to expanding the possibilities of using hydrogen as a complementary path for the decarbonization of mobility and strengthening the path towards a carbon-neutral society.”

Why Green Hydrogen Matters for Transport and Industry

Hydrogen produced from renewable electricity is drawing rising attention as an emissions-free alternative to diesel and natural gas, particularly for heavy transport and industrial operations. Brazil’s energy mix, already dominated by hydropower, places the country in a strong position to produce green hydrogen at competitive costs.

Iberdrola, Neoenergia’s parent company, has been building hydrogen capacity in Europe and aims to replicate similar models in Latin America. The Brasília station is designed not only as a demonstration site but as a foundation for a wider national strategy around hydrogen corridors and industrial symbiosis.

Fuel-cell vehicles convert hydrogen into electricity through an electrochemical reaction. The process emits only water vapour, operates quietly, and offers high energy efficiency. These attributes make hydrogen an attractive complement to battery-electric mobility, especially in regions where charging infrastructure is sparse or long-range use cases dominate.

Implications for Investors and C-Suite Decision-Makers

Brazil’s hydrogen sector remains at an early stage, but government agencies, utilities, and international manufacturers are now moving with purpose. The Neoenergia-Honda partnership illustrates how public R&D frameworks, private investment, and industrial innovation can converge to test scalable solutions.

For executives overseeing low-carbon transition strategies, the project offers three clear lessons. First, hydrogen is gaining traction not as a replacement for battery electrification but as a parallel pathway for hard-to-electrify segments. Second, national utilities are emerging as central actors in hydrogen infrastructure, supported by regulatory-driven innovation programmes. Third, automakers are reassessing their decarbonisation models as global markets look for diversified clean-mobility options.

A Step Toward Brazil’s Emerging Hydrogen Economy

Brazil has stated ambitions to become a leading exporter and domestic user of green hydrogen. Progress has been uneven, but partnerships such as this one point to growing momentum. If successful, the Brasília station could serve as a reference project for replication across major cities, industrial hubs, and freight corridors.

As both companies reaffirm their target of carbon neutrality by 2050, the collaboration reinforces the wider shift underway in Latin America’s largest economy: accelerating the deployment of renewable-powered technologies, expanding choice in low-carbon mobility, and aligning industrial capabilities with global climate goals.

Brazil’s hydrogen landscape is still being shaped, but with utilities and automakers now moving into shared demonstration projects, the country is positioning itself more firmly in the global race to develop clean-energy transport systems.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Honda-logo-featured-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 23:56:29.380301

Between November 10 and 17, 2025, the Petrobras Transpetro carried out an operation considered a milestone for the Brazilian maritime sector: the refueling of three Transpetro ships with the renewable marine bunker fuel B24, composed of 24% biodiesel and 76% traditional bunker oil. According to an article published by the website Portos e Navios, the operation was carried out at the São Sebastião Waterway Terminal (Tebar), on the coast of São Paulo, and is part of the national strategy for decarbonizing maritime transport.

Transpetro ships are being supplied with B24 renewable bunker fuel.

This initiative signals real progress in Brazil's energy transition. The use of B24 renewable bunker fuel strengthens Petrobras' commitment to cleaner and more technological solutions for shipping, and positions the country among the leading developers of alternative fuels in the sector.

During the operation, three vessels were refueled: the tanker ship Zumbi dos Palmares received approximately 1.300 tons of fuel, while the ships Rômulo Almeida and Carlos Drummond de Andrade received approximately 400 and 300 tons of renewable bunker fuel, respectively.

This marine fuel was supplied by PBio, a Petrobras subsidiary specializing in biofuels. As a ""drop-in"" solution, B24 can be used directly in existing engines without the need for technical adaptations or equipment replacement—a decisive factor for immediate viability and reduced operating costs.

This characteristic has been considered one of the key points for accelerating the energy transition in maritime transport, since existing ships can operate with lower carbon intensity along national and international routes.

Petrobras initiative: technical characteristics and environmental certifications

The B24 renewable bunker fuel is composed of 76% conventional bunker oil and 24% FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester) biodiesel. In addition to meeting technical performance specifications, the fuel has international certification according to the ISCC EU RED standard, which guarantees traceability and compliance with rigorous socio-environmental criteria.

This certification is fundamental to broadening global acceptance and enables the fuel to be traded in international ports as well. The adoption of certified fuels demonstrates companies' concern for the environmental requirements of regulatory bodies and standards established by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

Another important feature is that B24 renewable bunker fuel has a lower sulfur content compared to traditional marine fuel. This contributes to the reduction of air pollutants, ensuring greater compliance with decarbonization policies and environmental targets that are already being implemented worldwide.

History of the adoption of sustainable fuels in the maritime sector.

The authorization for the commercialization of renewable bunker fuel with up to 24% biodiesel was issued by the National Petroleum Agency (ANP) in 2024. Since then, Petrobras and Transpetro have been conducting tests and gradual operations with marine fuels containing renewable content.

In 2025, Petrobras obtained international certification to formally market low-sulfur, high-renewable-content fuel at Brazilian terminals, consolidating the use of the B24 blend in commercial operations. Prior to this, tests had already been conducted on different ships, evaluating parameters such as stability, combustion, and engine performance.

These initiatives place Brazil in a strategic position, keeping pace with sustainability trends that are already advancing in major maritime markets in Asia, Europe, and North America.

Sustainability and carbon emission reduction

The environmental importance of adopting B24 renewable bunker fuel.

The use of B24 renewable bunker fuel represents a significant step towards reducing maritime greenhouse gas emissions. The shipping sector is historically associated with high emission rates due to the global transport of cargo. The use of biodiesel reduces carbon emissions compared to pure fossil fuels.

According to information released by Petrobras, the adoption of this renewable fuel blend can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20% during ship operations. This reduction increases the environmental competitiveness of companies and helps meet international standards and requirements imposed by the IMO.

Furthermore, B24 promotes sustainability because it allows the inclusion of recyclable or sustainably sourced raw materials in the production chain, such as used cooking oil or agro-industrial by-products. In this way, it also contributes to strengthening the bioeconomy and the circular economy.

Impact of Petrobras' initiative on the Brazilian shipbuilding sector.

National leadership in the energy transition of shipping.

The supply of B24 renewable bunker fuel to Transpetro's ships demonstrates that the energy transition in the Brazilian maritime sector is already underway. This operation not only represents a technological milestone, but also paves the way for Brazil to strengthen its position in the global renewable fuels market.

The use of sustainable marine fuel also enhances port competitiveness and can attract more companies and shipping routes to operate in the country. Mastering this technology allows for the development of logistical and industrial capabilities linked to biofuel production, generating a direct impact on the economy and the production chain.

Furthermore, initiatives of this kind reinforce public and private policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions, meeting national environmental targets, and modernizing Brazilian port infrastructure.

Challenges and limitations for large-scale use

Despite the progress, the adoption of renewable bunker fuel still faces obstacles. Among the main challenges are:

Production and supply of sustainable raw materials in sufficient volume to meet growing demand.

Port and logistics infrastructure is still under development to ensure a regular supply of renewable fuels.

Cost and competitiveness of the fuel, which can vary depending on the biofuel market.

Despite these limitations, experts believe that initiatives like this make renewable fuel increasingly accessible and competitive, encouraging investment and public policies to expand the use of low-carbon alternatives.

What does this advance by Petrobras mean for Brazil now?

The operation carried out by Petrobras with Transpetro's ships shows that Brazil has the technical and industrial capacity to lead the adoption of renewable fuels In shipping, the B24 blend presents itself as a viable, immediate, and scalable solution for reducing emissions in the maritime sector.

This move demonstrates that sustainability can go hand in hand with operational efficiency, competitiveness, and innovation. By opting for B24 renewable bunker fuel, Brazilian companies in the shipbuilding sector are taking a leading role in a global market increasingly committed to decarbonization.

The challenge now is to transform this initiative into a standard, expand supply to other vessels, develop infrastructure, and continue advancing low-carbon fuels for the future of shipping.",https://clickpetroleoegas.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Petrobras-Transpetro.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 03:59:17.073854

Jamie Whitehead

Live reporter

It's been a few hours now since Airbus announced it needs to implement an urgent software update to thousands of its planes. This comes after the discovery that intense radiation from the sun could corrupt data crucial to flight controls.

If you are just joining us, here's the latest:

Several airlines around the world have announced potential service disruption, including American Airlines, Delta, Air India and Wizz

But EasyJet says it has already completed the required software update and is planning on operating its flights as normal on Saturday

We've heard from London's two biggest airports - Heathrow and Gatwick - Heathrow says this has no impact on its operations, while Gatwick is expecting some disruption

The UK's Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander says the impact on UK airlines seems limited, and advises passengers due to fly this weekend to check with carriers for more information

Around 6,000 planes are thought to be affected, which is about half of Airbus's global fleet, our business correspondent Theo Leggett says this is a very unusual situation

What is the Airbus A320?

Airbus describes A320 planes as the ""aircraft family of choice for airlines around the world"".

These planes can fly up to 4,700 nautical miles (8,700km) and have a seating capacity from 120 to 244 seats.

The A320 also flies with 50% sustainable aviation fuel, which Airbus aims to use 100% of by 2030.

The planes feature a choice of two advanced turbofan engines, meaning they benefit from 20% fuel burn reduction when compared with previous generations of the aircraft.

EasyJet says it has 'already completed' software update to planes

EasyJet says it has ""already completed"" the software update on many of its planes and plans to operate its flights as normal on Saturday.

A spokesperson says: ""We plan to operate our flying programme normally on Saturday and ask that customers travelling continue to monitor their flights on flight tracker.""

The airline adds that safety is its highest priority and it ""always operates its fleet of aircraft in strict compliance with manufacturers guidelines"".

'The impact on UK airlines seems limited,' transport secretary says

Katy Austin

Transport correspondent

Responding to the technical issue with Airbus aircraft, the UK's Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander says:

“I am aware of the technical issue impacting certain aircraft and concerns over how this will affect passengers and flights this evening.""

She advises passengers who are due to fly this weekend to check with their carriers for the latest information.

The transport secretary says ""the good news"" is that ""the impact on UK airlines seems limited, with a smaller number of aircraft requiring more complex software and hardware changes"".

“I would really like to thank the experts, staff and airlines who are working at pace to address this and reassure passengers that work is ongoing.""

""It is heartening this issue has been identified and will be addressed so swiftly, demonstrating the high aviation safety standards globally,"" she adds.

Australian airline Jetstar says some of its flights are unable to depart

We've just seen an update from low-cost Australian airline Jetstar, which says some of its Airbus-operated flights are unable to depart at the moment.

""We’re working through the impacts on our fleet and to our customers. We'll have more information shortly,"" it says.

There is no impact to airline giant Qantas at this stage.

For context: Jetstar is Qantas's low-cost airline.

The latest from Heathrow and Gatwick airports

We've now heard from London's two biggest airports, Heathrow and Gatwick.

""We are aware of a directive requiring some airlines operating Airbus A320 aircraft to update software on their fleet over coming days, which may result in some disruption,"" a spokesperson for Gatwick Airport says.

""This is only impacting a small number of airlines at London Gatwick. Passengers should contact their airline for more information.""

Separately, Heathrow Airport says the required maintenance on some Airbus aircraft currently has no impact on its operations.

'Potential for disruption immeasurable at this stage,' travel journalist says

""Dozens of big airlines use these aircraft,"" travel journalist Simon Calder tells the BBC.

""So the potential for disruption is, I'm afraid, immeasurable at this stage.""

Calder says that while British Airways' mainline fleet of short-haul flights that are at Heathrow and Gatwick Airports use entirely Airbus A320 series planes, ""my understanding is that only three of those are affected by this and as a result they'll be able to get the work done overnight, hopefully with no disruption"".

He adds he has spoken to Wizz Air and EasyJet, who we have reported are expecting some delays. ""Now the assumption, I'm glad to say, is that your flight will be going ahead as normal and the airline will contact you if there is any change to that.""

About 80 aircraft affected at Gatwick, BBC understands

Simon Browning

Transport correspondent

The Airbus software issue could take hours to fix on the planes themselves, which an industry source suggests means some cancellations are inevitable over the weekend.

It is understood UK-based airlines are currently working on their plans, with one airline being particularly affected.

Planes will arrive in the UK this evening as usual, but it appears some will not do their next turnaround tomorrow and depart from the UK again.

I've been told airports will need to play “a logistical game of Tetris tonight to free up space” to make sure incoming aircraft can be parked overnight. Airports “will be having to park them remotely to ensure incoming long hauls have space"", the industry source says.

It is unclear how many engineers will be needed at once to update software. The skies at this time of year are quieter after the peak summer period and before the Christmas festive rush begins.

It is understood about 80 aircraft are affected at Gatwick Airport.

Air Canada not expecting any impact to operations

Air Canada says it's not expecting any impact to its operations as ""very few of our aircraft use that version of the software"".

However, connecting flights with other airlines could still be delayed by a knock-on effect.

Other Canadian Airlines WestJet and Porter don't have any of the A320 planes listed on their websites.

How long will repairs take?

Theo Leggett

Business correspondent

This issue affects around 6,000 aircraft.

For the majority of planes, the fix will involve installing new computer software. This should normally take about three hours.

But around 900 older planes will need computers replaced and will not be allowed to carry passengers again until the job has been completed.

How long that takes will depend on the availability of replacement computers.

It’s not yet clear whether there will be enough parts to meet demand.

Why this is an extremely unusual issue

Theo Leggett

Business correspondent

It was experienced on one flight, when an aircraft flying from Cancun to New Jersey was affected by a sudden and intense solar storm.

The radiation corrupted data in the ELAC - a computer used to operate control surfaces on the wings and horizontal stabilizer.

The fault caused the plane to go into a sudden descent.

Airbus says the plane had recently had its software updated. The issue had never arisen with the previous software.

But now, it insists it is acting out of an abundance of caution.

It took the issue to regulators itself and asked airlines to make changes.

EasyJet expects 'some disruption'

EasyJet says its aware of the communication from Airbus to airlines operating the A320 family aircraft and is ""currently working closely with the safety authorities and Airbus to implement the action we need to take"".

The airline says it is expecting this to result in some disruption and will ""inform customers directly about any changes to our flying programme tomorrow and will do all possible to minimise the impact"".

“Safety is our highest priority and EasyJet operates its fleet of aircraft in strict compliance with manufacturers guidelines,” its statement concludes.

Air New Zealand warns of disruption across number of flights today

Air New Zealand says it's currently affected by a ""global software issue impacting Airbus A320neo aircraft"", it says in a post on social media platform X., external

""As a precaution, all our A320neo aircrafts will be receiving a software update before operating their next passenger service,"" the airline says.

The statement continues by saying ""this will lead to disruption across a number of our A320neo flights today and we’re expecting a number of cancellations to services across that fleet"".

""If you’re travelling today, we will be contacting customers directly if your flight is affected,"" the airline adds.

There may be impact to some flights, CAA warns

Tim Johnson from the UK's Civil Aviation Authority tells the BBC that there may be disruptions to flights ""in some circumstances"".

""From a UK perspective, not all airlines fly Airbus A320 or the affected ones, so for some airlines there will be no impact at all,"" he says.

""For some, there may be some impact,"" he continues, adding that the CAA has been in touch with airlines and they're looking to make sure the maintenance is undertaken over the coming days.

He says the advice to customers is to ""check airline websites and apps for the latest info about what is happening"".

How did Airbus find the problem?

Theo Leggett

Business correspondent

The issue was discovered after a JetBlue aircraft en-route from Mexico to the United States in October experienced a ‘sudden drop in altitude’.

The plane made an emergency landing, with reports at the time suggesting 15 to 20 people suffered minor injuries.

It’s thought the incident was caused by intense solar radiation, which corrupted data in a computer used to help control the aircraft.

Now action is being taken to prevent further problems. About 6,000 aircraft worldwide are thought to be affected, all of them of the A320 family, which also includes the A319 and A321 models.

According to Airbus, the majority can be fixed with a relatively simple software update. However, some 900 older planes will need replacement computers, and will have to be taken out of service until they can be fixed.

But their impact on the environment cannot be denied. Greenhouse gas emissions, water quality impacts, and noise pollution are common helicopter-related issues that affect local communities and ecosystems.

Here’s the good news: the helicopter industry is constantly evolving, and many industry leaders are fighting to tackle these challenges head-on. Advancements like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hybrid-electric engines, and lightweight construction materials are improving efficiency, cutting emissions, and shrinking helicopters’ overall footprint.

Let’s explore how these rotary aircraft shape sustainability efforts, the innovations driving more climate-friendly operations, and the ways in which helicopters are powering the future of green energy.

The Environmental Impact of Helicopter Operations

Helicopters face many ecological challenges, from harmful emissions to wildlife disturbances. But ongoing innovations are helping to minimize their impact.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Helicopters emit greenhouse gases including CO₂, NOₓ, and carbon monoxide through aviation fuel combustion. While newer technologies have greatly improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions, many older rotorcraft still operate with less efficient systems.

The Positives:

While aviation accounts for roughly 2–2.5% of global CO₂ emissions, helicopters contribute less than 1% of the aviation sector’s CO₂ emissions.

Plus, modern advancements like engine improvements and the development of lighter construction materials have reduced their CO₂ output by around 50% over the past 50 years.

Wildlife Disturbances

Frequent, low-altitude helicopter flights can significantly disrupt wildlife. Birds and mammals often experience stress, flee, or change their behavior in response to noise. This can cause them to abandon their habitats and miss critical feeding and breeding opportunities. Over time, this disruption can fragment ecosystems, lower reproductive success, and threaten the biodiversity of national parks and wilderness areas.

The Positives:

While helicopter operations certainly cause some level of wildlife disturbance, they also play a key role in conservation efforts. Their ability to hover, travel at low altitudes, and perform quick, precise maneuvers makes them ideal for many conservation missions. Helicopters are crucial for performing land and wildlife surveys, collaring and tracking, rescue and relocation, anti-poaching measures, and more.

Helicopters can limit noise and visual disturbance to wildlife by flying at higher altitudes, using sound-dampening technologies, and optimizing flight paths. These techniques minimize wildlife stress and mitigate the resulting behavioral changes.

Soil and Water Quality Impacts

Helicopter operations—particularly those near heliports—can compromise soil and water quality through fuel leaks, chemical residues, and runoff from maintenance areas.

The Positives:

Despite the risk of surface runoff, using helicopters in place of heavy ground equipment still offers numerous advantages, like minimizing the need for destructive land clearing and new road construction.

Using helicopters also helps prevent soil erosion and lessens the footprint left on surrounding land.

Noise Pollution

Helicopters are crucial for a wide variety of industries, whether releasing Bambi Buckets to extinguish forest fires or placing rooftop HVAC units with extreme precision for new skyscraper builds.

The problem? Helicopters are loud. In fact, people often perceive helicopter noise as being nearly twice as loud as it actually is. This is likely because the low-frequency sound of rotor blades cutting through the air can travel long distances and penetrate homes and buildings.

Residents who live in the flight path of helicopters—especially in dense urban areas—often report stress responses to helicopter noise, difficulty concentrating, sleep disturbances, and property value concerns. Helicopter noise can also disrupt sensitive wildlife and ecosystems.

The Positives:

The aviation industry has made great strides in creating quieter, more efficient rotorcraft. Improved rotor designs, like blades featuring serrated edges or reshaped tips, smooth airflow and mitigate sound output.

The NOTAR (No-Tail-Rotor) helicopter system eliminates the tail rotor entirely, making for much quieter flight.

New sound-dampening materials are being constantly developed to absorb vibrations and reduce noise.

Electric and hybrid propulsion systems have been developed that are much quieter than traditional engines.

Noise reduction techniques in pilot training, stricter noise regulations in communities, and careful urban planning are helping minimize helicopter noise pollution.

Helicopter Innovations Driving Sustainable Aviation

As the aviation industry moves toward a greener future, helicopter manufacturers and operators are embracing technologies that limit emissions, improve efficiency, and minimize environmental impact. Let’s explore the innovations transforming how helicopters are built, powered, and operated.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

One of the greatest advancements in low-carbon aviation is the development of biofuels, or eco-friendly fuels made from renewable resources. The biofuel used to power helicopters is known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF is a green alternative to the conventional jet fuel that has traditionally powered helicopter engines.

SAF is derived from non-petroleum organic material known as “feedstocks.” These include:

Algae

Agriculture, animal, and municipal waste

Plant oils

Recycled cooking grease

The critical benefit of SAF is that it’s made from carbon sources that already exist as part of the natural carbon cycle, resulting in drastically lower emissions. In fact, in the future, 100% SAF could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 94% when compared to conventional jet fuel.

Engine Efficiency Improvements

Aerospace manufacturers are designing new, more efficient helicopter engines with higher compression ratios, improved turbine designs, and better cooling systems. These advancements improve overall performance and reduce energy loss, requiring less fuel to create the same amount of power.

Fuel efficiency improvements lead to:

Fewer destructive greenhouse gas emissions

Decreased operating costs

Extended aircraft lifespan due to minimal engine strain

Reduced noise pollution as a result of quieter, more efficient engines

Hybrid-Electric and Fully Electric Propulsion Systems

Another promising advancement in the push for more sustainable helicopter operations is the creation of hybrid-electric and fully electric propulsion systems. These systems reduce the usage of fossil fuels by either combining traditional engines with electric motors or replacing them entirely.

These systems can reduce fuel consumption by up to 5% when compared to traditional flight. They help helicopters reduce noise pollution, lower operational costs, and produce fewer harmful emissions—without compromising power or performance.

Learn more about emerging helicopter innovations.

Aerodynamics Advancements

Helicopters are inherently less aerodynamic than airplanes due to their rotating blades and need for vertical lift. However, improvements in aerodynamics are resulting in significant fuel savings.

Engineers are reconfiguring and streamlining rotor blades to reduce drag and generate lift more efficiently, minimizing the energy required to keep a helicopter in the air. Additionally, tail design modifications are reducing drag and boosting aerodynamic efficiency, resulting in smoother airflow and increased stability.

These innovations allow helicopters to sustain flight using less engine power, resulting in more eco-friendly and cost-efficient helicopter operations.

Advanced Composite Materials

Helicopter manufacturers are also using lighter alloys and advanced composites to reduce the weight of helicopter engines, thereby reducing the amount of fuel needed to sustain flight.

They’re also incorporating environmentally conscious materials into helicopter builds, like ceramic matrix composites, or CMCs. These innovations not only enhance fuel efficiency but represent an important step toward more Earth-friendly helicopter design and manufacturing.

Carbon Offset Programs

Another way aviation teams can compensate for harmful greenhouse gases is to establish or join carbon offset programs. Carbon offsetting is a way to compensate for CO₂ emissions by funding carbon reduction projects elsewhere.

Examples include:

Planting new trees to naturally absorb CO₂ from the atmosphere

Promoting sustainable forestry to preserve forests’ capacity to store carbon

Investing in clean water projects that eliminate the need to boil water over open fires

Distributing energy-efficient cookstoves to reduce wood and charcoal use, cutting both air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions

Supporting the development of renewable energy, such as wind and solar farms

Carbon credit programs are becoming a key part of helicopter sustainability efforts.

Sustainable Aviation Training

Finally, many flight schools and programs at major helicopter training centers are incorporating eco-conscious operational awareness into their training programs. Sustainable aviation awareness topics covered often include:

Energy management

Eco-friendly operation procedures

Emission reduction practices

Efficient route planning

How Helicopters Are Powering the Future of Green Energy

As renewable energy projects expand into more remote and challenging terrain, helicopters are becoming essential partners in environmentally conscious construction. Their unique ability to lift, transport, and position heavy materials from the air makes them invaluable in building wind farms and solar farms that support the global clean energy transition.

Development of Solar Farms

The demand for sustainable energy continues to grow. Renewable energy made up 92.5% of all new power added across the globe in 2024, with solar power contributing to 77% of renewable additions.

So, how do helicopters support solar energy? One fast-growing trend in solar farm development is hiring heavy-lift helicopter services to assist with the building of solar farm infrastructure. Helicopters are especially vital in remote and hard-to-reach locations.

Helicopters can transport heavy equipment and place solar panels with precision—all while enhancing project safety and efficiency and minimizing their ecological footprint. While heavy trucks and ground-based equipment destroy the ground and disrupt ecosystems, helicopters reduce disturbances by delivering and placing solar panels from above.

Development of Wind Farms

Currently, wind energy accounts for roughly 10% of global electricity generation. But the development of wind farms continues to grow, and so does the need for more environmentally responsible methods of construction. One answer? Helicopters.

Heavy-lift helicopters’ agility, load capacity, and ability to safely suspend workers over tall structures make them ideal for constructing renewable energy solutions like wind turbines. One of the largest costs for wind farm owners—and a detriment to the environment—is the need for new roads to transport tower sections and turbine blades to the wind farm location.

Hiring heavy-lift helicopters for wind farm construction means that transporting equipment is faster, less expensive, and less detrimental to the surrounding environment. Essentially, helicopter lifting enables renewable energy companies to more efficiently build clean power solutions in areas that were previously largely inaccessible.

Helicopters play a critical role in a variety of industries, from utility inspections and construction to emergency response and wildlife conservation. But their impact on the environment cannot be denied. Greenhouse gas emissions, water quality impacts, and noise pollution are common helicopter-related issues that affect local communities and ecosystems.

Here’s the good news: the helicopter industry is constantly evolving, and many industry leaders are fighting to tackle these challenges head-on. Advancements like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hybrid-electric engines, and lightweight construction materials are improving efficiency, cutting emissions, and shrinking helicopters’ overall footprint.

Let’s explore how these rotary aircraft shape sustainability efforts, the innovations driving more climate-friendly operations, and the ways in which helicopters are powering the future of green energy.

The Environmental Impact of Helicopter Operations

Helicopters face many ecological challenges, from harmful emissions to wildlife disturbances. But ongoing innovations are helping to minimize their impact.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Helicopters emit greenhouse gases including CO₂, NOₓ, and carbon monoxide through aviation fuel combustion. While newer technologies have greatly improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions, many older rotorcraft still operate with less efficient systems.

The Positives:

While aviation accounts for roughly 2–2.5% of global CO₂ emissions, helicopters contribute less than 1% of the aviation sector’s CO₂ emissions.

Plus, modern advancements like engine improvements and the development of lighter construction materials have reduced their CO₂ output by around 50% over the past 50 years.

Wildlife Disturbances

Frequent, low-altitude helicopter flights can significantly disrupt wildlife. Birds and mammals often experience stress, flee, or change their behavior in response to noise. This can cause them to abandon their habitats and miss critical feeding and breeding opportunities. Over time, this disruption can fragment ecosystems, lower reproductive success, and threaten the biodiversity of national parks and wilderness areas.

The Positives:

While helicopter operations certainly cause some level of wildlife disturbance, they also play a key role in conservation efforts. Their ability to hover, travel at low altitudes, and perform quick, precise maneuvers makes them ideal for many conservation missions. Helicopters are crucial for performing land and wildlife surveys, collaring and tracking, rescue and relocation, anti-poaching measures, and more.

Helicopters can limit noise and visual disturbance to wildlife by flying at higher altitudes, using sound-dampening technologies, and optimizing flight paths. These techniques minimize wildlife stress and mitigate the resulting behavioral changes.

Soil and Water Quality Impacts

Helicopter operations—particularly those near heliports—can compromise soil and water quality through fuel leaks, chemical residues, and runoff from maintenance areas.

The Positives:

Despite the risk of surface runoff, using helicopters in place of heavy ground equipment still offers numerous advantages, like minimizing the need for destructive land clearing and new road construction.

Using helicopters also helps prevent soil erosion and lessens the footprint left on surrounding land.

Noise Pollution

Helicopters are crucial for a wide variety of industries, whether releasing Bambi Buckets to extinguish forest fires or placing rooftop HVAC units with extreme precision for new skyscraper builds.

The problem? Helicopters are loud. In fact, people often perceive helicopter noise as being nearly twice as loud as it actually is. This is likely because the low-frequency sound of rotor blades cutting through the air can travel long distances and penetrate homes and buildings.

Residents who live in the flight path of helicopters—especially in dense urban areas—often report stress responses to helicopter noise, difficulty concentrating, sleep disturbances, and property value concerns. Helicopter noise can also disrupt sensitive wildlife and ecosystems.

The Positives:

The aviation industry has made great strides in creating quieter, more efficient rotorcraft. Improved rotor designs, like blades featuring serrated edges or reshaped tips, smooth airflow and mitigate sound output.

The NOTAR (No-Tail-Rotor) helicopter system eliminates the tail rotor entirely, making for much quieter flight.

New sound-dampening materials are being constantly developed to absorb vibrations and reduce noise.

Electric and hybrid propulsion systems have been developed that are much quieter than traditional engines.

Noise reduction techniques in pilot training, stricter noise regulations in communities, and careful urban planning are helping minimize helicopter noise pollution.

Helicopter Innovations Driving Sustainable Aviation

As the aviation industry moves toward a greener future, helicopter manufacturers and operators are embracing technologies that limit emissions, improve efficiency, and minimize environmental impact. Let’s explore the innovations transforming how helicopters are built, powered, and operated.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

One of the greatest advancements in low-carbon aviation is the development of biofuels, or eco-friendly fuels made from renewable resources. The biofuel used to power helicopters is known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF is a green alternative to the conventional jet fuel that has traditionally powered helicopter engines.

SAF is derived from non-petroleum organic material known as “feedstocks.” These include:

Algae

Agriculture, animal, and municipal waste

Plant oils

Recycled cooking grease

The critical benefit of SAF is that it’s made from carbon sources that already exist as part of the natural carbon cycle, resulting in drastically lower emissions. In fact, in the future, 100% SAF could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 94% when compared to conventional jet fuel.

Engine Efficiency Improvements

Aerospace manufacturers are designing new, more efficient helicopter engines with higher compression ratios, improved turbine designs, and better cooling systems. These advancements improve overall performance and reduce energy loss, requiring less fuel to create the same amount of power.

Fuel efficiency improvements lead to:

Fewer destructive greenhouse gas emissions

Decreased operating costs

Extended aircraft lifespan due to minimal engine strain

Reduced noise pollution as a result of quieter, more efficient engines

Hybrid-Electric and Fully Electric Propulsion Systems

Another promising advancement in the push for more sustainable helicopter operations is the creation of hybrid-electric and fully electric propulsion systems. These systems reduce the usage of fossil fuels by either combining traditional engines with electric motors or replacing them entirely.

These systems can reduce fuel consumption by up to 5% when compared to traditional flight. They help helicopters reduce noise pollution, lower operational costs, and produce fewer harmful emissions—without compromising power or performance.

Learn more about emerging helicopter innovations.

Aerodynamics Advancements

Helicopters are inherently less aerodynamic than airplanes due to their rotating blades and need for vertical lift. However, improvements in aerodynamics are resulting in significant fuel savings.

Engineers are reconfiguring and streamlining rotor blades to reduce drag and generate lift more efficiently, minimizing the energy required to keep a helicopter in the air. Additionally, tail design modifications are reducing drag and boosting aerodynamic efficiency, resulting in smoother airflow and increased stability.

These innovations allow helicopters to sustain flight using less engine power, resulting in more eco-friendly and cost-efficient helicopter operations.

Advanced Composite Materials

Helicopter manufacturers are also using lighter alloys and advanced composites to reduce the weight of helicopter engines, thereby reducing the amount of fuel needed to sustain flight.

They’re also incorporating environmentally conscious materials into helicopter builds, like ceramic matrix composites, or CMCs. These innovations not only enhance fuel efficiency but represent an important step toward more Earth-friendly helicopter design and manufacturing.

Carbon Offset Programs

Another way aviation teams can compensate for harmful greenhouse gases is to establish or join carbon offset programs. Carbon offsetting is a way to compensate for CO₂ emissions by funding carbon reduction projects elsewhere.

Examples include:

Planting new trees to naturally absorb CO₂ from the atmosphere

Promoting sustainable forestry to preserve forests’ capacity to store carbon

Investing in clean water projects that eliminate the need to boil water over open fires

Distributing energy-efficient cookstoves to reduce wood and charcoal use, cutting both air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions

Supporting the development of renewable energy, such as wind and solar farms

Carbon credit programs are becoming a key part of helicopter sustainability efforts.

Sustainable Aviation Training

Finally, many flight schools and programs at major helicopter training centers are incorporating eco-conscious operational awareness into their training programs. Sustainable aviation awareness topics covered often include:

Energy management

Eco-friendly operation procedures

Emission reduction practices

Efficient route planning

Optimized climb/descent profiles

SAF handling and compatibility

McCormick: SAF is long-term answer for corn demand, not E15

An ag economist says updates to federal biofuels policies could have a big impact on commodity markets.

Jim McCormick with AgMarket.Net says year-round E15 isn’t the long-term answer for corn demand. He tells Brownfield it’s sustainable aviation fuel.

“Over the next 10 to 20 years, I fear you’re going to find more and more people using these hybrid and all-electric cars,” he said. “As the battery life gets better, we have to find a different use for corn besides ethanol. Aviation fuel is the answer to our problem.”

McCormick says the SAF market is still in its infancy in the U.S., but investments need to be made sooner rather than later.

“As you lose those car sales and that demand for ethanol in vehicles, the aviation fuel is there to offset that lost demand.”

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, SAF production in the U.S. is estimated around 20-to-30 million gallons per year. The country’s jet fuel consumption currently exceeds 16 billion gallons annually.

However, it’s clear from recent Chinese government policy statements that the overall strategy is actually much more complex than simply building wind and solar farms, as it embraces several so-called ‘green fuels,’ such as hydrogen (green), hydrogen-containing ammonium, and sustainable aircraft fuel (SAF). FuelCellsWorks has described it as “the most diverse pivot” regarding green fuels for the country.

It’s not a case of greenwashing. It’s a bold statement. Green hydrogen produced using renewable electricity to split water can be fed into many different types of industries. It can be converted into ammonia for fertilizer and shipping, as well as fuel for aircraft, enabling cleaner travel for planes.

According to an analyst, China’s momentum towards green hydrogen has the potential to revolutionize heavy manufacturing and transportation in China’s upcoming 5-year plan (2026–2030).

Inside China’s uneasy transition to clean hydrogen

There is a paradox hidden within those numbers. The energy transition report from Agora illustrates that while the amount of renewable hydrogen produced in China is steadily increasing, the majority of hydrogen produced in the country still comes from coal. While the old dragon may have awakened and taken notice of its surroundings, it still hasn’t completely gone to sleep! There remains a risk that China locks itself into a fossil fuel dependency cloaked in a ‘green’ label.

Workers of change: Coal miners, engineers, and everyone in between

The lives of everyday Chinese people are impacted by the various plans and policies being created. For those who live in areas rich in coal, the fossil fuel industry is their source of employment, income, and identity, such as this adorable megaproject, smashing the global hydrogen race. The phased-out approach toward coal from an environmental viewpoint is seen as a threat to the way of life of these people.

Other parts of China see something less flashy but just as important happening right now. Engineers, along with their technicians, are creating some very large green hydrogen-to-ammonia complexes. In Inner Mongolia, many companies are constructing wind and solar systems to produce green ammonia, which will be used as either shipping fuel or even aviation fuel.

Local officials discouraged that option because “the material should be diverted to compost.” Raven then pivoted, applying for a biomass conversion facility permit instead.","RICHMOND, Calif. — Waste-to-hydrogen developer Raven SR has secured a crucial air permit and permission to begin building its first commercial-scale facility in California, marking a major step toward bringing hydrogen fuel derived from organic waste into the mainstream renewable energy market.

The $75 million facility, located on the closed West Contra Costa Sanitary Landfill in Richmond, is being developed in partnership with national waste management company Republic Services. Raven SR will lease the property and receive biomass feedstock from Republic’s transfer station already operating at the landfill.

The facility is designed to process up to 99 wet tons of biomass per day, including yard waste, agricultural residue and untreated construction wood, but excluding food waste. Once operational, the plant is expected to generate up to 2,400 metric tons of hydrogen annually. Company CEO Matt Murdock said construction is slated to begin early next year and noted that the final Richmond permit “should be straightforward to attain.”

Raven SR, founded in 2018 in Wyoming, has spent recent years moving its patented waste-to-fuel technology toward commercial use. The company converts organic waste into synthetic gas and then into hydrogen fuel — without the need for fresh water, an important environmental consideration in drought-prone California. Raven says its approach offers higher efficiency than conventional hydrogen production methods.

The company’s partners and supporters include Samsung Ventures, Chevron New Energies — which holds a 50% equity stake — and early investor Hyzon Motors, which developed the U.S.’s first hydrogen fuel cell refuse truck before shutting down. Chevron plans to market fuel from the Richmond plant throughout Northern California.

Murdock said the company learned key business lessons by observing the rise and fall of other renewable hydrogen ventures. He emphasized two takeaways: “don’t be dependent on government subsidies and don’t load your venture with debt.” He added that Raven is backed largely by equity rather than loans, and although tax credits are available, Murdock said “they’re not necessary to make the Richmond facility pencil out.”

The facility footprint will cover about an acre and a half — half of which will accommodate truck traffic for material delivery and hydrogen distribution. Raven expects to produce 60% to 70% of the facility’s energy needs on-site, supplementing the rest from renewable sources.

Long Path to Permitting

Permitting the facility took over three years — longer than expected, according to Murdock. The company initially tried to secure a solid waste facility permit and hoped to accept food waste as a feedstock source. Local officials discouraged that option because “the material should be diverted to compost.” Raven then pivoted, applying for a biomass conversion facility permit instead.

Throughout the process, Raven continued to fine-tune its system to maximize output and lower costs. Murdock acknowledged that excitement for hydrogen was initially high when the project was announced, but that enthusiasm has slowed. The delay comes as hydrogen funding has stalled nationally, including the suspension of California’s hydrogen hub after losing $1.2 billion due to reduced federal support under the Trump administration.

Still, Raven believes its facility could help revive momentum. Murdock said Richmond’s fuel “can be priced competitively to traditional hydrocarbons,” and he hopes the facility’s launch — planned for 2027 — will accelerate industry confidence. Raven already has additional sites in development, including a project in Spain, and intends to scale production nationwide. The company believes its system can also be modified to produce sustainable aviation fuel, methanol, and other next-generation fuels.

The CEO sees the launch as a potential turning point: “If we can produce a low-cost hydrogen and get it into the market... that’s going to be a big deal,” Murdock said. “My hope is that we can start pushing the dominoes the other way, and people start coming back into the market.”",,N,,2025-11-28 16:56:21.192512

EVs already represent close to 60% of new car sales in China, versus around 10% in the US in 2024, underlining the widening gap between the two markets.

According to International Energy Agency data, electric cars are expected to account for 25% of global auto sales this year, with cars with plugs already constituting well over half of new sales in China and around a quarter across Europe.

US electric vehicle adoption stalls

The contrast with the US could not be starker. The report notes that EVs made up only about 10% of US car sales in 2024, with a modest increase expected in 2025 as buyers rush to capture expiring subsidies before federal support is dismantled.

Tesla's once-dominant position began to erode this year, particularly in Europe where the company has suffered double-digit sales declines in several markets after people began boycotting the company due to Elon Musk's political activities. The fact that Chinese brands now offer very affordable models is not helping this situation.

Beyond passenger vehicles, decarbonisation in heavy-duty transport is finally beginning to gain traction, with electric lorry sales rising from a small base.

However, the report stresses that infrastructure for the kinds of high-power charging necessary to sustain electric heavy goods vehicles is at a ""barely-started"" stage in most countries.

Aviation and shipping, by contrast, remain way off course for net zero, despite Europe's ambitious mandates for e-kerosene and other sustainable aviation fuel, which still face financing hurdles and would cover only a small portion of demand, even if all planned projects were built.

Clean technology investment accelerates

While the political landscape has grown more hostile to climate action in some regions, the underlying economics continue to favour electrification. Global electricity generation from solar rose 28.3% last year, with China adding more solar capacity to its grid in a single month than any other country has ever built in an entire year.

Battery deployment is also fundamentally changing grid profiles in some advanced markets. In California, batteries already meet about 20% of peak evening demand on some days, rising to roughly 30% in parts of Australia, effectively displacing gas-fired generation during critical hours.

Benchmark data suggest clean energy is attracting around twice as much investment globally as fossil fuels, with solar costs plummeting year-on-year since 2009. Conversely, gas-fired power costs have barely moved, reinforcing the case for private capital to continue reallocating towards low-carbon infrastructure.

For corporate and financial audiences, the report's core message is that the physics and economics of the transition are pulling in one direction while politics pushes in another, creating both execution risk and competitive opportunity.

Companies that treat 2025's turbulence as an excuse to pause decarbonisation efforts risk finding themselves on the wrong side of what the report calls ""the race for the future"".",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/deae93146605e530b9e16fa983b73c6e:67fd1391b694c7f61203b2f9475f19e8/joshua-fernandez-nelvfxwaz8m-unsplash.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 11:56:10.873144

At the Jurong Island 25th Anniversary event, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong said the government aims to expand research capabilities, test new energy systems, and strengthen talent development, announcing six new partnerships that support Singapore’s strategy to increase specialty chemicals, sustainable materials, and next-generation fuels, such as hydrogen, ammonia and sustainable aviation fuel.

“These partnerships show how strategic collaboration across the ecosystem can accelerate the transformation we envision for Jurong Island,” Jurong Town Corp. (JTC) Chief Executive Jacqueline Poh said.

Jurong Island hosts more than 100 global energy and chemical companies and is one of the country’s most land-intensive industrial areas. According to JTC and the Economic Development Board (EDB), nearly 300 hectares have been allocated for future energy infrastructure. Growing demand for specialty chemicals — driven by Asian consumption and global sustainability trends — is expected to generate more than 1,000 jobs in the coming years.

JTC and the National University of Singapore (NUS) will begin a 2026 study on Phase 2 of the Sustainable Tropical Data Center Testbed, to be located on Jurong Island. The testbed will allow data center operators to pilot AI-ready, low-carbon technologies, such as immersion cooling, direct-to-chip cooling, predictive energy management, and intelligent workload optimization. The initiative supports Singapore’s plan for a 700-MW low-carbon data center park on Jurong Island, the largest in the country.

A*STAR’s Institute of Sustainability for Chemicals, Energy and Environment (ISCE²) and Surbana Jurong also signed an MOU to collaborate on the upcoming Low Carbon Technology Translational Testbed (LCT3).

Singapore is also drawing climate-tech startups into its industrial ecosystem with Third Derivative (D3), a global climate-tech accelerator run by the Rocky Mountain Institute, giving companies on Jurong Island access to more than 280 emerging startups working on decarbonization, clean energy, and advanced materials.

Keppel Ltd. joins JTC to study a renewable-energy microgrid testbed in 2026 to trial digital demand-response systems and explore thermal-energy networks to reduce cooling loads for energy-intensive users like data centers. These systems could redistribute surplus energy and reduce electricity demand across the island’s industrial facilities.

One of the largest commitments came from Aster, which is investing $150 million in a hydrogen-ready integrated gas turbine at its Jurong Island complex. The project will generate and utilize low-carbon electricity and supply excess power to Singapore’s national grid. Along with Air Liquide, it will explore producing low-carbon hydrogen using auto-thermal reforming technology combined with carbon capture, aligning with the country’s National Hydrogen Strategy.

The shift toward low-carbon manufacturing also requires new skills and training pathways. Under its MOU with JTC, NUS will explore creating training modules, internships, and a potential specialization in industrial decarbonization and sustainable digital infrastructure. Advario Singapore will work with Workforce Singapore to redesign jobs and upskill 150 employees to prepare for handling next-generation fuels, including ammonia.

This milestone marks the world’s first commercial-scale production of jet fuel derived from ethanol as a feedstock.
The ethanol solution The aviation industry has an urgent problem.
Moreover, the plant uses a wide variety of sustainable feedstocks to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional jet fuel.
“Our SAF has a higher energy density than traditional Jet‑A fuel, making it a better quality fuel,” the company’s website noted.","LanzaJet, a US-based fuel producer, announced successful production of jet fuel from ethanol at its Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Soperton, Georgia.

This milestone marks the world’s first commercial-scale production of jet fuel derived from ethanol as a feedstock. Furthermore, it offers the first non-petroleum renewable solution that is compatible with existing aircraft.

The achievement is the culmination of 15 years of R&D and validates LanzaJet’s proprietary Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology.

The ATJ technology can utilize a broad range of sustainable feedstocks, including agricultural residues, energy crops, municipal solid waste, and captured carbon.

The development offers great promise to innovators, farmers, fuel producers, and the aviation sector.

“This achievement marks the culmination of 15 years of research and development, collaboration, investment, and scale-up, and represents a critical breakthrough for the aviation industry with evidence that ethanol can be transformed into jet fuel at commercial scale,” the company stated.

The ethanol solution

The aviation industry has an urgent problem. Currently, SAF is the only viable near-term solution for decarbonizing long-haul flights.

But the dominant production method, Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), faces rapidly constrained supplies of feedstocks like used cooking oil.

Hence, the world needs a scalable alternative. LanzaJet’s proprietary Alcohol-to-Jet technology aims to solve this issue.

The conversion of ethanol to Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK), a type of SAF, is accomplished through a continuous catalytic process (Alcohol-to-Jet).

This process involves a series of chemical reactions, often including dehydration (to convert ethanol to ethylene), oligomerization (to build longer hydrocarbon chains), and hydrogenation/hydrotreating (to saturate the molecules and refine them into kerosene-range fuel).

“This is an important milestone for LanzaJet and our investors, and it’s a major win for global aviation – perhaps serving as a beacon of hope for the future,” said Jimmy Samartzis, Chief Executive Officer of LanzaJet. ​

The company says that the ATJ technology is one of the most promising commercially ready solutions in a decade, offering a scalable way to decarbonize aviation by utilizing widely available ethanol.

It could enable nations to enhance energy security, control domestic fuel supply chains, and boost their agricultural sectors through economic development.

Better quality fuel

The Freedom Pines Fuels facility is a First-of-a-Kind (FOAK) integrated plant that required over $300 million in investment. It incorporates FOAK technologies, such as Technip Energies’ Hummingbird (Ethanol-to-Ethylene), and a joint DOE/LanzaTech Oligomerization solution.

Moreover, the plant uses a wide variety of sustainable feedstocks to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional jet fuel.

The resulting fuel, once blended with Jet A-1, is a fully certified solution compatible with current planes and infrastructure.

“Our SAF has a higher energy density than traditional Jet‑A fuel, making it a better quality fuel,” the company’s website noted.

The plant is a significant economic engine for rural communities. It created hundreds of construction jobs. It is now sustaining over 65 direct and indirect jobs in Treutlen County, Georgia.

LanzaJet is deploying its technology globally, with current projects in the US, Australia, Japan, India, the United Kingdom, Colombia, the European Union, the Middle East, and Kazakhstan.

Aviation’s path to Net Zero by 2050 is a challenge of colossal scale. LanzaJet’s success demonstrates that the foundational technology exists today to finally accelerate the transition.",https://cms.interestingengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IE-30.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 10:56:56.879727

Globally, we generate between 2.1 and 2.3 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste per year.
This could grow to 3.8 billion tonnes by 2050.
Only 7% of the 106 billion tonnes of materials used annually worldwide come from recycled sources.
This gives way for a more streamlined and successful circular economy, when waste is appropriately recovered and reintroduced into the community.","Waste collection has long been seen as a background service; removing what society no longer values. Globally, we generate between 2.1 and 2.3 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste per year. This could grow to 3.8 billion tonnes by 2050.

Knowing that waste contributes to 3-5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, it is clear change must happen quickly. And in a world facing rapid population growth and escalating climate pressures, how we collect and manage waste is emerging as one of the most powerful levers for sustainability and even a potential solution for climate change challenges.

Waste is a vital source, and the beginning of value creation. Our perception of this material must change to no longer be viewed as the end of the journey, but the start of an exciting new chapter in this cycle.

Only 7% of the 106 billion tonnes of materials used annually worldwide come from recycled sources. There is an abundance of untapped potential when diverting waste from landfill, reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.

According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), municipal solid waste across countries exceeded 770 million tonnes in 2023 -about 552 kg per person - and yet landfilling remains the primary disposal method, accounting for around 40% in many countries.

When intelligent routing systems, real-time data, predictive fleet analytics, and rigorous safety standards work in harmony, collection becomes strategy. These innovations optimise efficiency, drive diversion from landfill, enhance material recovery, and redefine what service excellence looks like.

What was once seen as a cost centre is now an engine of environmental and economic value. This is the model Tajmee'e was built to deliver.

In the UAE, collection is the entry point into bigger opportunities, including material recovery facilities, waste-to-energy systems, and a circular economy framework. This shift supports national ambitions such as the UAE Net Zero by 2050 initiative, and the Circular Economy Policy 2021-2031.

When disposed of appropriately, waste is an alternative resource which can be converted to hydrogen, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), electricity, and more, contributing to the UAE's increasing rise in energy demands.

In the words of H.E. Dr. Sultan Al Jaber, Chief of ADNOC, during his opening speech at ADIPEC, the demand for energy, including new grids and data centres, will require up to $4 trillion in investment annually. Waste can be part of this solution.

Further, taking collection to the next level for the UAE and the economy requires aligning operational transformation coupled with the vision of the national strategy. Embedding advanced collection models boosts the green economy, upskills local talents, and reinforces national leadership in sustainable resource management.

The most profound change lies in shifting the community's mindset around waste. The global economy is only about 7.2% circular today despite the fact that 90% of the materials entering our systems are raw, valuable materials.

By influencing behavioural change among the public to recycle, and embedding technology during collection through sensor-enabled bins, digital tracking, and route optimisation, materials becoming traceable, streams become clean and contamination drops. This gives way for a more streamlined and successful circular economy, when waste is appropriately recovered and reintroduced into the community.

In this light, Tajmee'e marks a decisive turning point in terms of how we define progress. It signals our evolution from a standard collector to a national champion of unlocking the value of waste. The journey begins at collection, yet its impact reverberates across the entire sustainability chain.

We are building the backbone for smarter, safer, and greener cities - proving that waste isn't an endpoint, but a resource waiting to be reimagined. We are engineering a cleaner, more sustainable tomorrow.",https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/1764270544-LEADIMAGETEMPLATE-2025-11-27T230848830.png?format=pjeg&auto=webp,N,,2025-11-28 11:56:40.126588

And the Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation is calling for tax incentives to help refine more bio-jet fuel locally.","Sports organizers, including the International Olympic Committee, are increasingly grappling with how to handle carbon emissions related to big events.

The University of Hawaiʻi Warriors’ recent loss on the road to the UNLV Raiders marked more than a fall to a Mountain West Conference foe.

The game also had the kind of environmental implications that increasingly concern organizers of big-time sports events: a massive carbon footprint. That’s an inescapable reality for Hawaiʻi’s athletics program, where the Warriors’ air travel for that game alone produced an estimated 122,732 kilograms of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of driving a Tacoma pickup truck from Kaimukī to Haleʻiwa and back more than 5,000 times.

That doesn’t account for the fans who traveled 2,700 miles to the disappointing away game, which dropped UH’s conference record to four wins and three losses.

Jeff Mikulina, a climate consultant who helped craft Hawaiʻi’s energy policy, says it’s important not to vilify sports events as polluters, but instead take a look at their impact to gain a better understanding of aviation’s role in the state’s carbon footprint.

“People love sports,” Mikulina said. “Let’s not demonize it, but let’s use it as a catalyst to say, ‘How can we travel and enjoy this entertainment and this pastime without burdening our climate?’”

That idea has animated a growing movement. The International Olympic Committee has announced goals to reduce emissions related to the Olympic Games by 50% by 2030 and created webpages outlining wide-ranging climate action policies and reports on recent games. Academics at big football universities, meanwhile, have started studying how expanded, transcontinental conferences have increased emissions linked to major football games.

University of Hawaiʻi Athletic Director Matt Elliott wasn’t familiar with the work the IOC is doing but said it is something the UH athletics department might look into. More broadly, he said, assessing sustainability related to UH’s sports team travel “is … I think something that we can absolutely think about.”

“What are we doing to help protect this environment here?” he said. “What can we do as an athletics department?”

The work is unfolding as the Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation struggles to comply with a legal settlement requiring the state to decarbonize transportation in Hawaiʻi entirely by 2045. Dealing with aviation has proven to be the biggest challenge, and the transportation department has said the technology doesn’t exist to meet the settlement requirement.

Impacts of Tourism Are Enormous

Sports events are far from the only contributor to aviation emissions in Hawaiʻi. In 2018, Civil Beat estimated the carbon footprint of travel to and from the islands by tourists using emissions calculators from a United Nations aviation agency and the federal Environmental Protection Agency, as well as 2017 travel data from the Hawaii Tourism Authority.

The analysis found that the 3.8 million visitors from the western U.S. alone that year produced emissions roughly equal to those produced by driving a car around the equator 225,000 times. Gov. Josh Green is now seeking to address tourism’s negative side effects with an additional hotel tax to go toward environmental mitigation.

Like tourism, sports are considered optional activities by many, compared to travel for work and family. Sports-related travel provides another window into carbon emissions, in part because of college football, which has captured the attention of sustainability researchers. Although all sports-related travel generates carbon emissions, football is the biggest, given the small army of players, coaches and staff that travel for games.

Formulas and studies offering insights have followed. Last year, Molly Russell and Paige Greenberg, two graduate students at the University of Michigan’s Center for Sustainability Systems, studied the carbon emissions of air travel by their popular college team, the Wolverines.

Motivated by the prospect of big television deals, USC, UCLA, Oregon and Washington had just joined the Big 10 Conference, originally the exclusive domain of Midwest universities, joining relative newcomers such as Rutgers and Maryland to create a transcontinental, 18-team super-conference. A non-conference home game against the University of Texas piqued the grad students’ interest in air travel after a Michigan news site reported a parade of private jets landing at local airports.

They decided to tackle the question of what conference expansion meant for the planet, using a formula created by researchers at Arizona State University. A central question was how public policies designed to decrease carbon emissions jibed with having students fly all over the continent to play football.

“Institutions like the University of Michigan (U-M) are increasingly committed to sustainability,” they wrote, “raising questions about how to reconcile environmental goals with the realities of increased carbon emissions.”

They found that the conference’s geographic expansion would more than double emissions related to Michigan football games.

Solutions Include Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The University of Hawaiʻi doesn’t need to shift conferences to face this quandary because it’s always had to travel a long way to the continent, regardless of what conference it was in. While that has always been costly, Elliott doesn’t see distance and location as a disadvantage — especially when it comes to recruiting players, hosting games and being central to the community.

“The story is there’s a huge advantage to being here,” he said. “Students want to be here. We get to retain our local athletes. We can recruit students who want to come play in this special place.”

Hawaiʻi’s isolation also makes home games particularly special.

“Because we are isolated, because we are kind of in our own space, I think it brings people with this energy and passion for the university,” he said.

With that comes the inconvenient reality of a gigantic emissions impact. Using the formula created at Arizona State in consultation with the University of Michigan’s Russell, Civil Beat found that football teams and staff traveling to and from Hawaiʻi for games in 2025 will have produced an estimated 1.5 million kilograms of CO2. Mikulina pegs that to the amount of emissions produced by providing electricity to 400 Oʻahu homes in a year.

Mikulina says the point of the calculations isn’t to deride UH football but rather raise awareness as motivation for change. He points to the International Olympic Committee as an example.

The 2024 Paris Olympics were powered entirely with renewable energy, the IOC’s website devoted to event says. Where generators were needed, it relied on biofuel, hydrogen or batteries. Organizers used existing venues to cut construction-related emissions and low-carbon construction methods to build a new aquatics center. Bike lanes were built for visitors so they could ride carbon-free to venues. Athletes were ferried to competitions via electric, hybrid and hydrogen-powered vehicles.

Air travel remains a major contributor to the International Olympic Committee’s corporate carbon footprint, accounting for about 61% of its emissions, which the IOC openly discusses on a website laying out its climate action plan.

Regardless of whether this amounts to greenwashing or significant change, Mikulina said, the IOC’s efforts are raising awareness.

“Everybody loves the Olympics,” he said. “And now people are thinking about the impact it has and the opportunities we have to reduce emissions.”

For now, airlines and policymakers are looking at lower carbon sustainable aviation fuel, essentially the jet equivalent of biodiesel, to replace traditional jet fuel. And the Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation is calling for tax incentives to help refine more bio-jet fuel locally. The department also is looking at running airports more sustainably by adding more electric support vehicles and electric vehicle charging stations.

Hawaiʻi has made some big gains in reducing climate impacts in the electricity sector, he said. But concerning aviation, he said, “we’re on first down with the whole field in front of us.”",https://d1l18ops95qbzp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/2014/11/UH-UNLV-FOOTBALL2.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 09:59:22.814551

The investigation, launched on 17 March 2025, covers HVO biodiesel—also known as renewable or green diesel.

Following evidence that subsidised imports are causing material injury to UK biodiesel producers, the TRA’s Statement of Essential Facts sets out its intended final recommendation for a fixed duty measure, with proposed countervailing duties of between £257.80 and £303.56 per tonne.

Interested parties are invited to comment on the initial findings via the Trade Remedies Service by 19 December 2025.

Separately, the TRA has terminated its parallel investigation into dumped imports of HVO biodiesel from the USA due to a lack of significant evidence of dumping.

Notes to editors

Investigation period: 1 January to 31 December 2024; injury period: 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2024.

The investigation, launched on 17 March 2025, covers HVO biodiesel—also known as renewable or green diesel.

Hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) biodiesel is a renewable fuel that can replace mineral diesel.

The product covered in the investigations includes: biodiesel (or paraffinic diesel fuel / gasoil) obtained from synthesis or hydrotreatment of oils and fats of non-fossil origin, in pure form or as included in a blend, originating in the United States of America (US). This biodiesel is commonly known as hydrotreated (hydrogenated) vegetable oil diesel (HVO), renewable diesel or green diesel. Synthetic paraffinic kerosene (also known as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)) is excluded from this description of biodiesel.

Countervailing duties are one of three trade remedy tools used to address goods that are being unfairly subsidised by overseas governments and causing injury to UK industry.

Termination of investigation – the TRA will propose terminating a dumping or subsidy investigation if, at any stage during the investigation, we find that the dumping margin or subsidy amount for all relevant goods (cumulatively and per country) is below de minimis levels. We will publish a notice to explain why the investigation has been terminated and notify the Secretary of State and interested parties accordingly.

Following the verification and analysis of exporter data the TRA has determined that all three US exporters that took part in the case presented a negative dumping margin. Therefore, there was no significant evidence of dumping by US exporters Diamond Green Diesel LLC, St Bernard Renewables LLC, and Phillips 66.",https://www.gov.uk/assets/frontend/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2025-11-28 09:59:27.114654

These fuels are intended to decarbonise sectors that are difficult to electrify, such as maritime shipping and aviation. The planned 200 MW plant is expected to establish Oulu as the largest hub for synthetic fuel production in the Baltic Sea Region, based on the number of Power-to-X (PtX) projects currently in development.

Hege Økland, Managing Director of Hy2gen Nordic, said, “Hy2gen is very pleased to have secured a site for our project at the Port of Oulu. We would like to thank the City of Oulu and the Port of Oulu for choosing us as their partner in developing this area. We look forward to future collaboration in bringing our project to life.”

Hy2gen specialises in developing, financing, constructing, and operating facilities that produce Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBOs) and other PtX fuels for clients worldwide. Its portfolio includes renewable hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and PtX derivatives such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (e-SAF).

The company already has projects underway in Germany, France, Norway, and Canada. Its current pipeline includes 3.4 GW of projects in planning and construction, with an additional 15 GW in development. In 2023, Hy2gen acquired the Werlte facility in Germany, which at the time was the world’s largest operating power-to-e-methane plant. In spring 2025, CertifHy certified the facility as the first RFNBO e-methane producer in Germany, in line with EU regulations.

Oulu emerges as a hub for hydrogen derivativesMarko Kilpeläinen, Director of Urban Environment Services for the City of Oulu, stated, “With this announcement, Oulu now hosts more synthetic fuel production projects than any other city in the Baltic Sea Region.” Other companies that have announced preliminary plans for hydrogen and hydrogen derivative plants in the area include French company Verso Energy, German firms Energiequelle and ABO Energy, and Finnish companies P2X Solutions and Oulun Energia.

Oulu offers an abundance of renewable electricity at some of the lowest prices in Europe. The region is the largest producer of renewable electricity in the northern Baltic Sea area. Combined with the University of Oulu’s renowned hydrogen research and the city’s position as the third-largest recipient of R&D investment per capita in the EU, this ensures access to a highly skilled workforce.

The Port of Oulu benefits from excellent rail and road connectivity as part of the TEN-T transport network, enabling easy links to the rest of Europe. Additionally, Gasgrid Finland is planning a hydrogen transport infrastructure to connect Oulu’s production capacity with other regions in Finland and across Europe. Janne Hietaniemi, Key Account Director at BusinessOulu, highlighted these advantages as key factors supporting the region’s development as a leading hydrogen hub.

While the planning reservation has been granted, Hy2gen has not yet made a final investment decision. The company will now begin preparing detailed plans for the facility.

Such integration could also help stabilize energy markets in regions where volatility has been the norm.
In Africa, for instance, renewable infrastructure tied to local employment and capacity-building creates a buffer against political instability.","Where others see fragmented markets and regulatory complexity, Singal sees opportunity. His strategy involves both technological and geographical diversification. In doing so, this creates a network of renewable assets tailored to the resources and realities of each region. While much of the industry remains fixated on solar, wind, and hydrogen, Singal is pivoting toward more commercially resilient and politically viable alternatives, including methanol and methanol-to-jet fuels via gasification, eSAF (electrically powered sustainable aviation fuel) plants, HEFA-based SAF, and renewable diesel, as well as nuclear power. These are being coupled with digital infrastructure projects such as energy-efficient data centers and blockchain-based tokenization to enhance transparency and liquidity across the global energy trade.

“Governments and corporations are rethinking how they approach renewables. You can’t rely on one or two technologies and expect to solve global energy demand. What we’re building is a framework that works across geographies and is scalable, flexible, and financially sustainable.” Explained Singal.

That framework is already taking shape. Singal’s portfolio includes renewable energy initiatives tied to Ukraine’s post-war reconstruction, helping to rebuild energy independence through decentralized generation and smart-grid technologies. In Kazakhstan, Bulgaria, and Azerbaijan, his teams are working with local partners to introduce next-generation fuels that support industrial decarbonization and reduce reliance on imported hydrocarbons. In the Middle East, projects in Dubai and Qatar complement government-led diversification programs by offering scalable, private-sector solutions. Meanwhile, in the United States, development is advancing in Texas, Louisiana, and California; the latter of which is home to a fire-forest feedstock gasification plant that converts forest waste into clean energy, transforming an environmental hazard into a valuable resource.

Each initiative is designed to operate independently yet contribute to a unified global ecosystem. Financing structures often tie into export-import frameworks, enabling projects to move capital efficiently between regions. The inclusion of tokenization models that digitize project assets and energy credits aims to make the traditionally slow-moving energy sector more transparent and accessible to global investors.

Africa remains a cornerstone of this strategy. Long seen as the next frontier for renewables, the continent’s potential is finally aligning with investor interest. There has already been large-scale HEFA-based SAF and renewable diesel production in Ethiopia and South Africa. In Ethiopia, local feedstocks such as castor oil and Ethiopian mustard are being explored for conversion into sustainable fuels. At the same time, South Africa’s existing Fischer-Tropsch infrastructure provides an ideal foundation for processing related feedstocks. The Congo, meanwhile, represents a region where renewable projects could deliver both immediate and long-term benefits, from job creation to regional stability.

“The key is localization. Africa has the resources and the talent. What it needs are frameworks that connect local potential with global markets, and that’s what we’re helping to create.” Says Singal.

This approach reflects a growing recognition that the energy transition cannot rely solely on public funding or top-down policy. Many governments, particularly in emerging markets, lack the infrastructure or capital to scale renewables at the necessary pace. By introducing private investment backed by export-import financing and international partnerships, Singal’s model bridges the gap between national ambition and financial reality.

Technologically, the mix of methanol-to-jet fuel, gasification, and eSAF represents a pragmatic evolution of renewable energy, one that integrates circular-economy principles. Methanol-to-jet fuels and HEFA pathways utilize waste biomass and oils, reducing lifecycle emissions while providing a stable, energy-dense alternative to fossil fuels. Nuclear power, often overlooked in short-term political cycles, offers baseload stability critical to balancing intermittent renewables. Together, they form a hybrid energy architecture capable of supporting everything from regional grids to digital infrastructure like data centers, which are increasingly energy-intensive.

ADVERTISEMENT

“This isn’t just about replacing fossil fuels. It’s about designing an entire ecosystem that works technically, financially, and environmentally. That means integrating generation, financing, and technology under one umbrella.” Added Singal.

Such integration could also help stabilize energy markets in regions where volatility has been the norm. In Africa, for instance, renewable infrastructure tied to local employment and capacity-building creates a buffer against political instability. In Eastern Europe, decentralized grids and hybrid systems can protect national energy supplies from disruption. And in the U.S., a new generation of decentralized projects could make clean power more resilient to natural disasters and grid congestion.

Beyond the technical elements, Singal’s initiatives carry broader geopolitical significance. Energy has always been a tool of influence, so by establishing renewable and nuclear projects that link continents, private investors are increasingly shaping the future of global power, both literally and figuratively.

“If we’re going to hit Net-Zero targets, we need collaboration, not competition between regions. HEFA-based SAF, renewable diesel, methanol, and eSAF can all play a part. Kenya Airways recently flew a 50% locally sourced SAF blend, so that’s proof it can be done. The challenge now is scaling that success across continents.” Concluded SIngal.

From Africa’s renewable corridors to the industrial hubs of Eastern Europe, Singal’s global portfolio illustrates the next phase of the energy transition. It is no longer defined by single technologies, but by systems thinking. It’s a model where private capital, public policy, and innovation align. It’s also a model where the future of energy is being rewritten, one region at a time.

Has health care been sidelined?
Katherine Fierlbeck, the McCulloch professor of political science at Dalhousie University, gives the PC government ongoing credit for its commitment to health care in its first term.","In the 12 months since the Houston government won its second mandate, it’s made progress or fully delivered on many of the promises made during last fall’s election campaign.

The platform suggested the government would put its heft into making life more affordable, with attention also going to housing and health care. It gave nods to soaring rates of violence in schools and gridlock traffic in the capital region.

The Progressive Conservative government has indeed followed through, to varying degrees, with promises related to all those issues. But the focus of the government’s second term has been on natural resource development, which was given only a vague reference in the campaign platform.

First, what’s been delivered. In spring 2025 Nova Scotia saw a one-point cut to provincial sales tax, an increase to the basic personal amount for income tax and a one-point cut to the small business tax rate.

Tax cuts might be popular among voters, but the resulting revenue losses are probably to the chagrin of the Finance Department, which is now grappling with a $1.2-billion deficit. As it works on next year’s budget, the department has already directed departments to slow down hiring and explore some potential cuts.

The PC government also delivered free shingles vaccines for people 65 and older, a two-step increase to the minimum wage (bringing it to $16.50 this fall), and did away with bridge tolls and parking fees for hospital patients and visitors.

Another checkmark goes beside the promise to make more vacant public land available for affordable housing, though it’s a case that shows a promise kept doesn’t always equate to instant gratification or impact.

Yes, the PCs offered up two new pieces of land in the past year. No, there aren’t any new housing units to show for it. The land-for-housing program started in 2021 and land added in the government’s first term has so far resulted in a total of 18 new units, with nine of them renting below market rates.

For people now living in those units, the program likely seems worthwhile, but overall it would be hard to call it a runaway success. And given how acutely some people are still feeling the housing crisis, some might have expected more from the PC platform on housing.

The only other housing promise was to help first-time homebuyers to make a smaller down payment. That hasn't yet happened, although the province says ""news will be coming very soon"" about the program.

Another pledge that received mixed reviews was free hospital parking. While it wouldn't be a problem in smaller communities, in Halifax it underscored a shortage of parking spaces around hospitals and spurred staff complaints about being squeezed out of lots and parkades at their workplaces.

Other promises show signs of progress, or the government at least says it intends to follow through. See the full list below.

The PCs are, after all, just one year into a mandate that could last as long as four, so they still have time to make good on all their pledges, even if there’s no sign of movement yet.

The big pivot

One section of the election platform talks about strengthening the economy through natural resource development, but it didn’t garner much attention during the campaign. That’s probably partly because the party didn’t give it the platform of a stand-alone announcement — as it did with items such as a menopause centre of excellence and nixing bridge tolls — and partly because there were no concrete promises.

“We will realize the potential of our natural resources to produce the energy of tomorrow,” one campaign document said. “We are focusing on building the economy for the long term by taking advantage of our natural resources.”

Campaign materials referred to the province’s critical mineral potential, and the possibility of kick-starting local hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel industries.

Premier Tim Houston has said it wasn’t yet apparent at campaign time how necessary the push for resource development would be. But a year on, it’s now clear this work is the fulcrum of this mandate.

A couple months after the election, Houston started talking more explicitly about his vision for natural resource development, and a flurry of government action ensued.

The government lifted restrictions on fracking and uranium exploration and mining, streamlined environmental assessment and industrial permitting processes, opened a new call for offshore oil and gas exploration, and crafted an ambitious plan for offshore wind development — the list goes on.

Many of those actions have faced significant pushback over fears about environmental protection and human health, but Houston has been insistent that anything pursued will be done safely. It’s necessary, he says, to find new revenue streams as population growth and the economic boom of the past few years slows.

The province needs a stronger economy, his refrain goes, to pay for things like schools, housing and health care.

Has health care been sidelined?

The issue that helped drive the Tories into government in the first place may appear to have taken a back seat this time around. Health-related promises are fewer than they were in 2021, and even among the new promises, one is not directly related to health care (free parking) and another is already behind schedule (legislation for independent evaluations of the health authority was supposed to be tabled by earlier this year).

But sitting in the back seat isn’t the same as stopping or being left behind.

Katherine Fierlbeck, the McCulloch professor of political science at Dalhousie University, gives the PC government ongoing credit for its commitment to health care in its first term.

“It takes some time to be able to see the net effect of whether this is going to work well or not,” she said.

Fierlbeck, who studies health policy, said meaningful change in health care requires governments to “pump the money in,” which could be more challenging to do in the face of a sizable deficit and a contraction of money coming in. But momentum could carry the system forward for some time, she added.

How long things can coast before the big bet on natural resources will have to prove its worth — that might be a subject for the next election.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/0bd00902-84d6-415a-8bb9-14bf5377bff7,1764274669304/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C278%2C5343%2C3005%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-11-28 08:57:02.066235

In fact, our sister title Sustainability Magazine recently ranked Airbus 48th in its Top 250 World’s Most Sustainable Companies 2025.

Airbus' sustainability targets

Airbus has established sustainability targets that have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as outlined in its 2025 Pioneering Sustainable Aviation report.

Goals include a 63% reduction in its Scope 1 and 2 absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and the neutralisation of any residual emissions. Furthermore, Airbus aims to decrease its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 46% by 2035, using 2015 as a baseline year.

Safety remains a primary focus in its operations for its employees, products and services. Airbus's aircraft, helicopters and satellites are built to meet stringent regulatory standards with safety integrated into the design, testing and production phases.

Airbus is actively contributing to the wider aerospace industry's long-term objective of achieving net zero emissions by 2050.

Guillaume Faury, CEO at Airbus, says: “This means expanding production of these new, fuel-efficient aircraft to help airlines accelerate the renewal of their fleets.

He adds: “Airbus is advocating for and investing in sustainable aviation fuels, which are critical to making progress in reducing emissions today. Our core principles of safety, quality, integrity, compliance and security will guide us in all we do.”

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and the energy transition

A key component of Airbus's strategy is its decarbonisation roadmap, designed to support the energy transition in aviation. Airbus is focused on increasing the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) throughout the sector.

Currently, its aircraft can operate on a blend of up to 50% SAF and conventional fuel. Airbus has set a target for all its aircraft and helicopters to be capable of flying with 100% SAF by 2030.

The use of SAF could lead to a potential reduction in carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of up to 80% over its lifecycle compared to conventional kerosene, according to the International Civil Aviation Organisation.

To advance this goal, Airbus is collaborating with fuel producers, airlines, governments and researchers to accelerate SAF production and improve its availability on a global scale.

A circular economy approach to aircraft manufacturing

Airbus incorporates a lifecycle approach in its manufacturing process, designing its products for longevity with a lifespan intended to exceed 20 years. Airbus seeks to minimise environmental impacts across its operations and supply chains.

It has been working on enhancing supply chain resilience from the sourcing of materials through to the end-of-life management of its products.

A primary objective for Airbus is to reduce waste and the consumption of raw materials, thereby extending the lifespan of its services and products. Airbus also encourages its customers and partners to adopt similar circular economy principles.

Specific targets include a 20% reduction in waste collection and achieving 0% landfilling and incineration without energy recovery by 2030 compared to 2015 levels.

Julie Kitcher, Chief Sustainability Officer at Airbus, says: “We want to do business in a way that benefits society as a whole.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/b8ca38c972e9f9d52119202571a93dac:d0b3b4ad50bd7063173a0b6157e2346a/airbus-beluga-plane.JPG.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 08:57:06.489555

The terminal and airfield run on power generated by more than 760,000 solar panels, supported by one of the world’s largest off-grid battery systems.

Red Sea Global, the airport’s developer, has said the airport “will be powered using renewable energy alone,” part of its plan for the entire destination to operate on 100% renewable electricity.

It is also the first airport in the Kingdom to supply 35% sustainable aviation fuel, with the operator stating the blend “reduces the emissions produced by each aircraft… by up to 35%.”

Dubai’s solar build-out

In the UAE, Dubai Airports has begun installing nearly 63,000 solar panels across both DXB and DWC in what it called “the world’s largest rooftop solar installation project at an airport.”

The system, with a capacity of 39 MWp, is expected to generate more than 60,000 MWh annually. Dubai Airports says this will meet 6.5% of DXB’s power demand and 20% of DWC’s needs, cutting 23,000 tonnes of CO₂ a year.

Chief executive Paul Griffiths said the effort is about “embedding sustainability into the core of everything we do,” and reducing the hub’s long-term energy dependency.

The model follows Terminal 2’s earlier 5 MW solar installation, which already reduces the building’s grid electricity use by around 29%.

Car parks as power plants in Abu Dhabi

Abu Dhabi has taken a more decentralised approach. At Zayed International Airport’s new terminal, a solar-powered car park uses 7,542 panels generating 3 MW of capacity.

The installation supplies the parking structure and exports excess power to the terminal, saving around 5,300 tonnes of CO₂ annually.

Abu Dhabi Airports CEO Shareef Al Hashmi said the new terminal was designed with “technology which enables sustainability, protects the environment, and creates a cleaner, greener… building.”

The result is an airport where shaded parking doubles as distributed generation infrastructure.

Saudi Arabia’s off-grid test case

Red Sea International is even more ambitious. The entire airport is designed to operate off the national grid, supported by large-scale solar farms and battery storage.

The wider destination is expected to avoid up to 600,000 tonnes of CO₂-equivalent emissions each year once operational.

The airport’s renewable-first model shows what a new build can achieve when energy is treated as central infrastructure rather than a utility bill.

Airlines push the fuel transition

While airports build electricity capacity, Gulf airlines are tackling the fuel challenge.

Emirates has conducted several high-profile demonstration flights using 100% SAF in one engine, including a Boeing 777-300ER and an A380.

After the first 777 demo flight, Emirates COO Adel Al Redha called it “a milestone moment… and a positive step for our industry,” highlighting the need to cut aviation’s carbon footprint.

Industry-wide, SAF production remains small. IATA estimates global SAF output could reach 2 million tonnes in 2025, still less than 1% of expected airline fuel demand.

That gap illustrates why airports capable of hosting renewable generation, storage and SAF supply will become critical nodes in aviation’s energy transition.

Why the Gulf is positioned to lead

The Gulf has a combination of advantages that few regions can match. Its solar resources rank among the strongest in the world, and both Saudi Arabia and the UAE have government mandates that push renewable deployment at scale.

Many of the region’s flagship megaprojects are being built from scratch, allowing energy systems to be designed around clean power from day one rather than retrofitted later.

Large areas of available land make it feasible to install solar fields, battery storage and district-scale utilities, while airports themselves are increasingly planned as components of integrated city districts rather than stand-alone transport hubs.

Saudi Arabia aims to add 130 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2030, and the UAE’s Energy Strategy 2050 targets a 50% clean-energy share in the national mix, creating a policy environment in which airport-level generation becomes a natural extension of wider national goals.

At destinations such as Amaala, entire utility networks, from energy and water to cooling, waste and airport systems, are being developed as one unified platform, positioning the airport as an active contributor to a clean-energy ecosystem rather than a passive consumer of power.

Pilot projects and operating models

Most Gulf airports are still early in the journey. Dubai’s rooftop programme and Abu Dhabi’s solar car park cover only part of each hub’s needs. But the direction is unmistakable.

As Abu Dhabi’s leadership put it, “net zero development has been a central ethos” in terminal design, a phrase now repeated across the region.

Red Sea International shows what a fully renewable airport can look like. Dubai shows how the biggest hubs can retrofit at scale.

Together they point to a future in which Gulf airports act not only as passengers’ gateways but as energy producers, storage sites and fuel hubs, infrastructure that powers both the grid and the aircraft it serves.

Why Should You Know About Australia Biofuel Market?
In short: the biofuel market is not just about fuel — it’s about energy security, sustainable agriculture, emissions reduction, industrial transformation and long-term value creation.","Australia’s biofuel market is entering a period of strong expansion as demand grows for sustainable, lower-carbon fuel alternatives in transport, industry and energy sectors. The Australia biofuel market size reached USD 2.79 billion in 2024, and is projected to grow to USD 9.29 billion by 2033, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.8% during 2025–2033.

This growth underscores how biofuels — including biodiesel, bioethanol and emerging advanced biofuels — are becoming central to Australia’s low-carbon fuel strategy, leveraging local feedstocks, regulatory support, and rising environmental awareness.

Why the Market Is Growing So Rapidly

Several key forces are fueling the rapid expansion of the biofuel market in Australia:

Strong Policy Support & Regulatory Mandates for Renewable Fuels

One of the primary drivers is government regulations and blending mandates that require or incentivize the use of bioethanol and biodiesel blends in transport fuels. These mandates create a consistent baseline demand for biofuels, encouraging investment in production capacity and supply infrastructure.

Moreover, national and state-level renewable energy and emissions-reduction targets are pushing stakeholders to adopt cleaner fuel options. This regulatory push helps make biofuels economically viable, even when competing with traditional fossil fuels.

Availability & Diversification of Feedstock — Agricultural Residues, Oilseeds, Waste Oils

Australia benefits from a diverse and abundant feedstock base: oilseeds (such as canola), sugar-based residues, used cooking oil, tallow, and potential non-food crops like Pongamia for advanced biofuels.

Recent efforts to develop renewable feedstock sources — including plantation of biofuel-suitable crops and recycling of waste oils — are helping scale production sustainably, reduce raw-material costs, and strengthen supply security.

Rising Demand for Cleaner Transport & Energy Security

As awareness of climate change grows, consumers, businesses and governments are increasingly open to cleaner, greener energy. Biofuels offer a drop-in alternative to conventional petrol and diesel — usable in existing internal-combustion engines — making transitions easier.

Additionally, for sectors that are harder to electrify (heavy transport, industrial vehicles, aviation, agriculture), biofuels present an immediately deployable low-carbon solution. This demand helps fuel investments and infrastructure expansion for biofuel production and distribution.

Technological Advances & Development of Advanced Biofuels

The biofuel industry in Australia is gradually evolving beyond first-generation bioethanol and biodiesel. There's increasing interest in advanced biofuels — including renewable diesel, waste-to-fuel conversions, and next-gen feedstocks like Pongamia.

New production processes, improved yields, waste-derived feedstock utilisation and sustainability-linked innovations are making biofuels more cost-effective and scalable, attracting greater investment and accelerating adoption.

What the Opportunities Are

The expanding Australia biofuel market offers several distinct opportunities for producers, investors, supply-chain players, agricultural stakeholders, and policy-makers:

1. Scale-up of Biodiesel & Bioethanol Production Capacity

With demand growing, there is room for expanding existing refineries and establishing new plants — especially those leveraging local feedstock (oilseeds, waste oils, agricultural residues). Producers focusing on efficient, sustainable operations can capture significant market share.

2. Advanced & Second-Generation Biofuels Development

Investments into advanced biofuels — using non-food oilseed crops (e.g., Pongamia), waste biomass, or waste oils — offer long-term potential. These fuels, especially renewable diesel or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), can cater to sectors that are hard to electrify, offering high-margin opportunities.

3. Feedstock Supply Chain & Agricultural Integration

Farmers, agri-commodity companies, waste-oil recyclers and feedstock-suppliers can benefit from increased demand. Cultivating oilseed crops or collecting and processing used cooking oil/waste fats for biofuel feedstock creates new revenue streams for rural and agricultural communities.

4. Infrastructure & Distribution Network Expansion

As demand rises, so does the need for blending, storage, transport, distribution — including refineries, blending terminals, logistics, and fuel-station support. Infrastructure investors and logistics providers have opportunities to build and upgrade networks to support scaled biofuel distribution.

5. Low-Carbon Transport & Heavy-Duty Sector Adoption

Biofuel producers and distributors can target heavy-duty transport, agriculture equipment, marine, aviation and industrial applications — where electrification is difficult and biofuels offer immediate decarbonization.

6. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) & Export-Ready Biofuel Supply

As global demand for sustainable aviation fuel grows, Australia’s biofuel sector — particularly those producing renewable diesel or SAF-ready feedstock — is well positioned to serve export markets, especially in Asia-Pacific.

Recent News & Developments in Australia Biofuel Market

• June 2025: A new report highlighted that biofuel blending mandates and supportive regulatory reforms have increased investor interest and pipeline projects for biodiesel and ethanol capacity expansion across Australia — reinforcing long-term demand structure.

• August 2025: Several agricultural and energy-sector stakeholders announced pilot programmes cultivating non-food oilseed crops (like Pongamia) for renewable diesel feedstock — marking a shift toward sustainable, locally grown biofuel inputs and reducing reliance on imported oilseeds.

• November 2025: Industry press noted a surge in corporate and transport-fleet uptake of biodiesel blends and interest from heavy-duty haulage companies in converting part of their diesel consumption to biofuel blends — signalling commercial demand growth beyond personal vehicles.

Why Should You Know About Australia Biofuel Market?

You should know about Australia’s biofuel market because it represents a critical lever in the country’s energy transition, environmental strategy, and fuel-sector evolution. As the economy seeks to decarbonize, biofuels offer a practical, scalable alternative — especially for transport and sectors where electrification is challenging.

For producers, biofuel offers a strong growth opportunity across production, feedstock, distribution, and end-use sectors. For investors and supply-chain stakeholders, this market promises growth, diversification, and long-term value — anchored by regulatory support, sustainability demand and expanding adoption. For agriculture and rural economies, biofuels can offer new value for crops, waste oils, residues, and feedstock supply chains, unlocking rural development and circular-economy benefits.

In short: the biofuel market is not just about fuel — it’s about energy security, sustainable agriculture, emissions reduction, industrial transformation and long-term value creation. Understanding it means staying ahead where energy, environment and economy meet.","https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/c_scale,f_jpg,q_auto/69294266be978d001d521489.png",N,,2025-11-28 09:59:40.525848

Each item and material every bit as effective and reliable as their fossil-based alternatives. Each of them circular and climate-friendly by design.

And what if we could do all that while supporting rural communities, delivering quality jobs and green growth, and reducing our carbon footprint at the same time?

It’s much closer than you might have thought. Welcome to the bioeconomy — an innovative solution to a fossil-based problem that we quickly need to leave behind.

In 2023, the EU bioeconomy generated €863 billion, representing 5% of EU GDP and supporting over 17 million jobs. But it has the potential to be so much more.

The EU is well-positioned to lead the global bioeconomy: powered by science and innovation, based on our own natural resources and raw materials, and supported by our single market.

More than two-thirds of EU member states have committed to national bioeconomy strategies. Ireland has a Bioeconomy Action Plan and the National Development Plan also highlights the sector’s potential. We want to support more breakthroughs to make the leap from innovation to growth.

The EU’s new Bioeconomy Strategy aims to supercharge this growth. We will work with farmers, foresters and other small businesses to bridge the gap from lab to market and turn ideas into industrial reality.

The strategy will ensure a robust financial ecosystem, combining public and private investment. It will also provide regulatory clarity; delivering simple, coherent rules that speed up approvals for innovative solutions.

Europe needs to nurture those bio-based sectors with the greatest potential for economic expansion and environmental benefit. But this growth must be guided by a firm commitment to sustainability.

Europe’s forests, soils and other ecosystems need to be managed wisely, and within ecological limits. We have one eye on green growth and the other on a sustainable future, and that means the bioeconomy must combat biodiversity loss and pollution.

That also requires a strong focus on circularity and better use of leftover biomass like organic waste or agricultural residues such as cereal straw or sawdust. Instead of being dumped, these can fertilise our crops, feed our animals or form the basis for biomaterials. We can turn waste into wealth and help Europe to produce more value with fewer primary resources.

The bioeconomy can boost European prosperity and sharpen our competitive edge. And it will reduce our reliance on vulnerable global supply chains and on other countries for raw materials.

I see it as a defining pillar of the European project to build strategic autonomy and tackle climate change; a society-wide investment in our rural communities and regions, in our environment and ecosystems, and most of all, in our future.

Think about it as you go about your day, surrounded by countless fossil-based products. And imagine a cleaner, more sustainable, more resilient Europe.",https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9753/4876659_11_seoimageog_XAV_8769_1_.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 21:56:10.801191

Calgary, Alberta, Nov 27, 2025 –TheNewswire - Expander Energy Inc. (“Expander”) ispleased to announce that a letter of intent has been signed with EastFraser Fiber Co. Ltd. (“EastFraser”) to secure the required biomassfeedstock and land for the Mackenzie Biofuel Project, a proposed BiomassElectrolysis to Liquids (BETL®) Bio-Synfuel facility in Mackenzie,British Columbia (BC).

BETL is an innovative, patented and patent pendingprocess for making low carbon bio-synthetic fuels developed byCanadian Nuclear Laboratories (CNL) and Expander which leveragesExpander’s technology for biomass gasification, bio-synthetic fuelproduction, and electrolysis technology. The resulting fuel will becomprised entirely of carbon sourced from biogenic (atmospheric)sources and is expected to have very low life cycle carbonintensity.

The proposed facility will utilize the BETL®technology to convert 84,000 dry tonnes per year of forestry woodwaste into 30 million litersper year of renewable diesel, renewable naphthaand bio-wax with life cycle carbon intensity of the fuel to levels80% lower than fossilequivalents (as low as 14 gCO2e/MJ using the BC Low Carbon FuelsBranch (BCLCFS) GHGenius LCA model). The biofuel production isintended to displace fossil derived fuels (e.g., diesel, aviationfuel) and could result in a net avoidance of up to 90,000 tonnes of carbon dioxideannually. The 100km area surrounding Mackenziehas significant fiber resources. Expander will assess the potentialto scale the Mackenzie Biofuel Project to process a total of 336,000tonnes of dry biomass per year to produce 120 million litres per year Bio-Synfuelproduction and net avoidance of 360,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide peryear.

Growing global demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel(SAF) makes the addition of Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (FT- SPK)production to the facility commercially appealing. Expander iscurrently working with key strategic commercial partners from theaviation industry to assess initial market interest in 18 million liters/year of SAF, with potential opportunity to expand SAF to 72 millionliters/year production. The Mackenzie Biofuel Project will become thefirst of kind low carbon clean fuel production in British Columbia andCanada using forestry wood waste biomass (cellulose). This facility could meet much of the short-term SAF targetfor British Columbia.

Expander is also very pleased to announce thatcommunity and Indigenous leaders / organizations have provided theirsupport for the MackenzieBiofuel Project. The McLeod Lake Indian Band(“MLIB”) and the District of Mackenzie (“Mackenzie”) haveprovided letters of support for further development of theproject.

The Mackenzie Biofuel Project is one of the three projects

identified in the feasibility studycompleted earlier this year. Expander aims to continue the developmentof the project with the goal to secure funding early in 2026, withproduction by 2029. Natural Resources Canada through the Clean FuelsFund program supported the completion of a feasibility study thathelped to identify several prospect locations across Canada, one ofwhich was this Mackenzie site. The Clean Fuels Fund has alsosupported the Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) study that isexpected to be complete in early 2026 and will result in acomprehensive facility design, cost, schedule and business plan forthe Mackenzie BiofuelProject.

The completed facility will be a global showcase fornext generation biomass based E-fuel production.

“We are thrilled to announce significant progress onthe Mackenzie Biofuels Project. Over the past 18 months, ourdevelopment team has worked tirelessly, and we are on track tocomplete the fully funded $8 million FEED study by Q1 2026. With landand feedstock secured, and strong support from key community andIndigenous leaders, we are now able to accelerate the project.” saidSteve Kresnyak, Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer,Expander Energy Inc. “In addition, Expander Energy Inc. is activelyengaging with strategic partners to secure project funding. We lookforward to sharing more details as these partnerships are finalized,marking another step toward delivering price competitive Biomass basedE-fuels for Industry and Aviation”

“It is truly exciting to see the BETL® Bio-Synfuelprocess progress to this stage. Achieving this new supply agreementbrings the technology another step closer towards the production ofeconomical, ready-to-deploy, renewable fuels,” commented Dr. StephenBushby, CNL’s Vice-President of Science and Technology. “Thisproject leverages Canada’s expertise and capabilities in hydrogenand hydrogen isotopes – originally built in support of the nuclearsector, to advance bold, innovative ideas towards deployment.

“The MacLeod Lake Indian Band is committed to environmentally responsible development of natural resources within our traditional lands that are consistent with the values of the Tse’khene people and provide significant economic opportunities in the region for decades to come.” Said Chief Harley Chingee – MacLeod Lake Indian Band

“The District of Mackenzie is thrilled to welcome a Biomass Electrolysis to Liquids Plant to our community. The past few years have been extremely challenging as residents watched our tax base shrink and community members suffer job losses. The Mackenzie Bio-Synfuels facility is a huge step forward in promoting economic growth for our community and the region. Their advanced proven technology will also provide additional support to our forest industry with their utilization of forest harvesting residuals. We are excited our community will be a participant in this sustainable solution that will reduce use of fossil fuels, while removing “wildfire fuels” from the forests surrounding Mackenzie.” said Mayor Joan Atkinson – District of Mackenzie
