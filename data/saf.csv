You'll soon have to pay a sustainable fuel fee as part of your flight ticket,Tessa Kaur,,,,,https://www.timeout.com/asia/news/flying-out-of-singapore-youll-soon-have-to-pay-a-sustainable-fuel-fee-as-part-of-your-flight-ticket-111825,"In a world first, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has announced that, starting from October 1, 2026, travellers flying out of Singapore will be charged a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Fee as part of their flight ticket.
SGD $1 for economy, SGD $4 for premium.
This is part of the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint, which aims to help Singapore achieve net-zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.
The money collected from the levy will go into a statutory fund used to purchase sustainable aviation fuel, which is more expensive than regular fuel.
Singapore intends to use sustainable fuel for 1 percent of all its fuel needs.","In a world first, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has announced that, starting from October 1, 2026, travellers flying out of Singapore will be charged a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Fee as part of their flight ticket. This only applies to outbound passengers and not transit passengers.

Don’t worry, the levy isn’t unreasonable, especially if you tend to travel on a budget. The amount charged depends on the distance flown and whether you’re in economy or a premium cabin (business and first class).

This means that if you typically fly economy or premium economy, your lowest levy will be just SGD $1 to fly within Southeast Asia, and the highest will be SGD $10.40 to fly to the Americas. That said, if you fly business or first class, you’ll pay four times more than economy travellers, which means SGD $4.00 to fly within Southeast Asia, and SGD $41.60 to fly to the Americas. This is because longer flights consume more fuel.

The bands and prices are as follows:

Band 1, Southeast Asia. SGD $1 for economy, SGD $4 for premium.

Band 2, Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, Papua New Guinea. SGD $2.80 for economy, SGD $11.20 for premium.

Band 3, Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific Islands, and New Zealand. SGD $6.40 for economy, SGD $25.60 for premium.

Band 4, Americas. SGD $10.40 for economy, SGD $41.60 for premium.

It’s still extra money out of your pocket, but take heart in the fact that you’re supporting meaningful change for the environment. Mr Han Kok Juan, director-general of CAAS, said that the levy’s introduction “marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub”. This is part of the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint, which aims to help Singapore achieve net-zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.

The money collected from the levy will go into a statutory fund used to purchase sustainable aviation fuel, which is more expensive than regular fuel. Singapore intends to use sustainable fuel for 1 percent of all its fuel needs.

The oil and gas industry operates through highly complex systems in which upstream, midstream and downstream segments often follow distinct strategies and priorities. Upstream focuses on exploration and production efficiency, midstream prioritises secure and reliable supply routes, while downstream aims to enhance refining performance and reduce environmental impact. Aligning these three sectors towards a single goal — decarbonisation — remains one of the greatest challenges. Reducing emissions across exploration, transportation and refining requires technological innovation as well as cross-sector collaboration and consistent strategic alignment.

For these goals, the Oil & Gas Decarbonisation Congress (DECARBON) 2026 unites global industry leaders from the whole value chain to exchange practical insights and proven approaches that deliver measurable results. Throughout the Congress, companies across upstream, midstream and downstream share their experiences and innovations from P2X technologies and green hydrogen to AI-powered autonomous plants.

In the upstream-focused session, Kuwait Oil Company offers valuable perspectives on integrating energy transition strategies into exploration and production planning. Fayez Al-Mezel, Business Planning Specialist, delivers the presentation about the integration of energy transition into upstream strategies. He addresses key challenges such as capital-cost dispersion, technology readiness and infrastructure constraints. The speaker outlines mitigation measures, including modular pilot projects, standardised designs and verified data management. This approach demonstrates how strategic planning and transparent performance tracking translate decarbonisation ambitions into efficient, cost-competitive outcomes.

In the midstream discussion, LiveEO (Session Sponsor) highlights digital tools that enhance pipeline safety and sustainability. Nick Ferguson, Chief Evangelist, explains that satellite technology elevates pipeline safety. Drawing on a case study, he demonstrates that combining high-resolution satellite imagery with artificial intelligence enables the detection of 73% of previously unidentified threats and improves prediction accuracy by 80%, supporting proactive risk management and streamlined operations.

Kent participates in the dialogue dedicated to downstream decarbonisation, specifically low-carbon fuels and feedstock. Luigi Crolla, Head of Energy Transition Technologies, explores how integrating electrolytic hydrogen and Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) technologies into waste-to-fuel processes enhances Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) yield and reduces carbon intensity.

A.D. Banker helps agents navigate client options impacted by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). While ACA changed the standard for how individuals apply for health coverage, it also created limitations for underwriting in ACA-compliant applications but ultimately helped make health insurance more accessible to everyone.

As agents assist clients through health insurance applications, it’s important to understand the key differences between ACA and Non-ACA health plans. Having this knowledge not only helps an agent find the right coverage for their clients but also builds trust and partnership.

Even though the ACA made health coverage far more accessible, there are still those that fall outside the ACA’s requirements. These policies are sold outside of the Health Insurance Marketplace and still use medical underwriting to determine eligibility and premiums, which is why A.D. Banker has created a comprehensive overview.

ACA-compliant plans follow the federal regulations established by the ACA. Non-ACA plans, on the other hand, often do not – which can affect everything from coverage and consumer protections to renewability and underwriting.

Key lessons in this article by A.D. Banker include:

Understanding Medical Underwriting

Definitions of Essential Health Benefits

Key Differences Between ACA- and non-ACA-Compliant Plans

Pre-Existing Conditions Outlined

Common Pitfalls in Underwriting

Steps to Empowering Clients

For new agents, understanding medical underwriting — and knowing how to prepare clients for it — is one of the most valuable skills an agent can develop, especially as enrollment season approaches. Stay ahead on the path to success with A.D. Banker’s health insurance CE courses today.

The European Union (EU) has introduced a sweeping regulation called ReFuelEU Aviation, aimed at increasing the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This landmark policy will gradually blend SAF into jet fuel, reducing aviation emissions. For people who care about sustainable travel, this means more eco‑friendly flights in the near future.

What Is the ReFuelEU Aviation Mandate?

Under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, fuel suppliers serving EU airports must include a minimum share of SAF in their fuel mix.

From 2025, at least 2% of the aviation fuel supplied at EU airports must be SAF.

By 2030, this share will rise to 6%, and the goal is to reach 70% SAF by 2050.

There is also a sub‑target for synthetic aviation fuels (sometimes called e‑fuels): starting at 1.2% in 2030, increasing up to 35% by 2050.

These mandates are part of the EU’s broader “Fit for 55” package, which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030.

Why This Matters for Travelers

Cleaner Flights: As SAF replaces more conventional jet fuel, flights will generate fewer CO₂ emissions over time. This supports a more sustainable aviation sector.

Transparent Environmental Labels: The regulation includes a new eco‑label for flights, helping passengers choose greener flights based on estimated emissions per passenger.

Long-Term Promise: The gradual rise in SAF blending means that within a few decades, a large portion of flights from EU airports could be powered by greener fuel.

What Counts as Sustainable Fuel?

The regulation defines eligible SAF under strict criteria. These include:

Advanced biofuels made from waste or residues (not food crops)

Synthetic aviation fuels made from renewable hydrogen (e-fuels)

Recycled-carbon fuels derived from waste materials, complying with EU sustainability rules.

Importantly, biofuels from food or feed crops (like palm or soy) are not included in the SAF mandate.

Challenges & Early Progress

In 2024, only 0.6% of aviation fuel supplied at EU airports was SAF, according to the first annual technical report by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).

The low uptake is partly due to high production costs: SAF remains more expensive than traditional kerosene.

Some airlines and industry voices warn that supply may not scale fast enough to meet future targets.

Still, the regulation creates a stable policy framework for investment. Fuel suppliers now have clarity, which could accelerate SAF production.

What This Means for Future Travelers

More sustainable choices: As SAF becomes more common, more flights will operate with lower-carbon fuel.

Flight labels you can trust: The eco‑label gives passengers a way to compare the environmental footprint of different flights.

Growing innovation: The SAF push boosts research in synthetic and advanced biofuels — this could eventually lower costs and improve availability.

Long-haul greener travel: As SAF production scales, even long-distance flights could reduce emissions significantly — a welcome prospect for eco‑aware globetrotters.

Looking Ahead

The ReFuelEU Aviation regulation officially came into force on 1 January 2024, with many of its key rules taking effect from 2025.

EU member states will designate authorities to enforce the law, collect data, and penalize non-compliance.

At the same time, revenues from any fines will be redirected into SAF research and innovation.

According to EASA’s market report, the SAF used in 2024 came mainly from recycled cooking oil (81%) and animal fats (17%).

Final Word

For global travelers, Europe’s SAF mandate represents more than just an industry policy shift — it’s a signal that the future of flying could be greener, more transparent, and more responsible. As sustainable aviation fuel takes off, it promises to make the skies cleaner without compromising your travel experience. Bon voyage — on a flight powered by tomorrow’s greener fuel.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10Novf6-1.jpeg,N,,2025-11-17 14:56:56.775806

But even with the Trump administration receptive to the idea and the government again open, most farmers and bankers have concluded that any aid will be too little and too late to rescue the next planting season.

“I’m cash-flowing on what my anticipated yield is based on what I know today,” said Anne Schwagerl, who farms 1,100 acres in Minnesota with her husband and son. “I am not banking on the U.S. government to do it.”

The federal government reopened Wednesday after 43 days, which Trump administration officials had said was necessary before they could finish any farmer aid plan. But even if they work on it expeditiously, it could still take months before farmers receive any checks. That would be well after the crucial winter period when farmers talk to their bankers and make decisions about the next year.

Ms. Schwagerl said the American Relief Act, which was passed in December during the Biden administration, offered an example of how long it could take for funds to reach farmers. Applications for the act’s $30 billion in disaster assistance did not open until July, and Ms. Schwagerl received her payment in September, nearly nine months after the money was authorized.

Administration officials have floated the idea of an aid package, or possibly the first in a series of aid packages, of between $10 billion and $15 billion. Some members of Congress have said much more may be needed, but after a handshake trade agreement last month with China that should restart American soybean sales, the amount that farmers ultimately receive may be revised downward.

“We may need to have a bridge to next year, but how many lanes that bridge has is going to be determined by what the market does between now and then,” Stephen Vaden, the deputy secretary of agriculture, said on the “AgriTalk” radio show last month.

The rising global demand for alternative fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), biodiesel, and renewable marine fuel, as well as shifting product slates, cost pressures, and the risk of stranded assets are all affecting profitability for European refiners. Additional concerns include Capex cost pressures, volatility in feedstock quality, and the need for digitisation to achieve better asset reliability and energy efficiency. Honeywell UOP has a long history of helping operators meet these challenges, and today it continues to expand its technology offerings to improve product quality and diversity, while also creating modular solutions that allow for faster deployment and scalability.

Regulatory Pressures

Existing refineries often need substantial retrofits for their hydrotreaters, processors, and co-processing units to handle renewable or synthetic feedstocks and produce fuels that meet new standards, while the demand for conventional fuels, such as gasoline and diesel, nears its expected peak.

More than any other region, European refineries are operating in a fast-changing regulatory, economic, and technical environment. Among these, there are key policy frameworks that are raising both the risks and opportunities for operators:

European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)

The ETS places a rising cost on CO₂ and other greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from stationary industrial sources (including refineries). The tightening of allowances, increasing carbon prices, and risk of carbon leakage all put pressure on margins. Refiners must find ways to reduce emissions intensity, both in process (such as fuel gas, steam, and hydrogen usage) and from feedstock, or face high compliance costs.

ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation

Part of the EU’s European Green Deal, known as the Fit for 55 Package, the ReFuelEU Aviation (Regulation (EU) 2023/2405) aims to increase the share of SAF sustainable aviation fuel at EU airports from a minimum of 2% in 2025 to 70% by 2050, with an additional sub-target for renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO) of 1.2% by 2030 and 35% by 2050.

FuelEU Maritime Regulation

Also part of the Fit for 55 Package, the FuelEU Maritime (Regulation (EU) 2023/1805) introduces a requirement for ships above 5,000 gross tonnage calling at EU ports to use fuels with GHG intensity, on a Well-to-Wake (WtW) basis, which is gradually reduced, starting with a small percentage in 2025 and reaching much steeper cuts by 2050. In view of these challenges, maritime fleet operators are seeking alternatives with lower carbon intensity (CI) than conventional heavy fuel oils (HFO) to meet evolving policy requirements in the maritime sector. Failure to comply brings penalties, and fuel suppliers must ensure the availability of low-GHG and synthetic fuels, creating market opportunity for refiners to supply those fuels.

International Maritime Organization (IMO) Net-zero Framework

This year, the IMO committed to net zero GHG emissions from shipping by approximately 2050, requiring interim reductions. New regulatory instruments under discussion include GHG intensity targets, fuel standards, and low or zero-carbon fuel adoption. This puts pressure across global supply chains, including refining and fuel production. Refineries must anticipate demand for lower-CI marine fuels, synthetic fuels, and fuel blends that meet both ship engine requirements and lifecycle emissions criteria.

Ready-Now Technologies

Proven technologies are now available for European refiners, and the Honeywell UOP refining portfolio is continually evolving to help refinery operations transition to sutainable fuels. Worldwide, there are now 58 UOP Ecofining®-powered units in the operating, construction, or planning phases to efficiently convert waste bio-feedstocks into renewable diesel and SAF. This can help reduce GHG emissions relative to fossil fuels by up to 80%.¹

Key players in the refining industry are embracing the transformation. For example, energy leader ENI leveraged Ecofining² as part of a long-term strat­egy to grow its renewable fuels business by converting its Gela refinery in Italy into a biorefinery. With a processing capacity of more than 400,000 MT/year, it is pro­jected to produce almost a third of the expected European SAF demand in 2025.

Solution Pathways

As renewable fuel demand continues to grow, European refiners are exploring additional renewable feedstocks to help meet regulatory requirements, transition to cleaner energy, and reduce operating costs to maintain margins. Honeywell UOP continues to develop new process technologies to help achieve these goals.

Honeywell UOP technologies like Ecofining, Co-processing, Fischer-Tropsch (FT) Unicracking®, UOP eFining® (methanol-to-jet), Ethanol-to-Jet (ETJ), and RTP (fast pyrolysis) processes enable the utilisation of a wide variety of feedstock sources for SAF, diesel, and other renewable fuels.

In particular, SAF can be produced with a variety of sustainable feedstocks, including vegetable oils and inedible fats, low carbon intensity alcohols, and even synthesised fuels derived from captured CO₂ and hydrogen (i.e. RFNBO). This represents an opportunity for oil and gas organisations pursuing their own decarbonisation journeys to support the aviation sector with fuels that can significantly reduce the environmental impact of flight.

Policies such as FuelEU Maritime and the IMO Net-Zero Framework also represent a significant opportunity for refiners to meet new alternative fuel demands for maritime fleet operators, who need to begin reducing carbon emissions by the end of the decade. Waste wood and plant residues from agriculture, forestry, and other industries, known as lignocellulosic biomass, represent a promising option for refiners as an abundant and relatively inexpensive renewable fuel feedstock. Solutions like RTP from Honeywell make these feedstocks more accessible to refiners by converting them into liquid intermediates like pyoil.

Honeywell UOP’s next-generation Biocrude Upgrading technology (Figure 1) offers an effective pathway for refiners to access these biomass sources to produce drop-in biomarine fuel, which can significantly reduce lifecycle carbon emissions from conventional fossil-based engines (Table 1).

Biocrude Upgrading technology also enables the production of SAF and renewable naphtha feed for gasoline production, giving refiners and project developers multiple options to monetise biocrude intermediates derived from lignocellulosic biomass.

Empowering refiners to Meet Compliance Targets

European refiners are navigating a complex landscape shaped by rising global demand for renewable fuels, evolving regulatory frameworks, and mounting cost and operational pressures. With tightening emissions standards under the EU ETS and ambitious mandates from ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime regulations, refiners must adapt quickly to avoid stranded assets and remain competitive.",,N,,2025-11-17 14:57:01.173713

“With our hydrogen recycling systems, we make an important contribution to the circular economy in industrial processes,” said Michael Höfling, CEO of ReiCat.
“Projects like this demonstrate that hydrogen recycling is an indispensable complement to power-to-X,” added Höfling.
Speaking to gasworld earlier this year, ReiCat COO Sophia Höfling made the case for its hydrogen purification and recycling tech.
“Our recycling systems let companies recover up to 98% of their process gas, which is not used up but only contaminated in the process, cutting costs and emissions.”","German gas treatment specialist ReiCat has supplied its hydrogen recycling system to flavour and fragrance manufacturer Symrise.

The tech will enable the firm to clean up hydrogen that has picked up impurities during the production of ingredients for perfumes and nutritional and taste enhancers.

The system works by capturing the exhaust stream and purifying it in a complex multi-stage process before the hydrogen is cycled back into production.

“With our hydrogen recycling systems, we make an important contribution to the circular economy in industrial processes,” said Michael Höfling, CEO of ReiCat.

Symrise purchased its first system from ReiCat in 2017 to decarbonise its US site. The latest deal will see the tech installed at its facility in Granada, Spain.

“Projects like this demonstrate that hydrogen recycling is an indispensable complement to power-to-X,” added Höfling.

The Symrise Group plans to become entirely greenhouse gas neutral by 2045. Around 80% of its emissions are created during the production and transport of its substances.

This includes scent compositions for perfumes and colognes and taste and nutrition solutions for sauces, ready-made meals, and instant noodles.

In a 2024 corporate report, the company outlined plans to replace natural gas in its exhaust air incinerators with hydrogen once the infrastructure is available. It plans to use carbon capture and storage to reduce any emissions that cannot be avoided.

Speaking to gasworld earlier this year, ReiCat COO Sophia Höfling made the case for its hydrogen purification and recycling tech. “A gas might leave the plant at high purity, but by the time it reaches the end-user it could be contaminated in various ways,” she said.

“Our recycling systems let companies recover up to 98% of their process gas, which is not used up but only contaminated in the process, cutting costs and emissions.”","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2025/11/shutterstock_2559100843.jpg",N,,2025-11-17 12:56:58.625402

The deal was announced during the Dubai Airshow 2025 and marks a significant step in flydubai’s upcoming move into long-haul operations.

The engine order supports flydubai’s broader growth strategy as the airline diversifies beyond its current all-737 fleet. Established in 2008, the Dubai-based carrier has expanded rapidly to serve more than 135 destinations across 57 countries, and is now preparing to add long-haul routes to its network.

GE’s GEnx-1B was selected for its strong track record in performance, durability, and fuel efficiency—key traits for carriers operating in the Gulf’s demanding hot-and-harsh environments.

More than two-thirds of 787s in service today are powered by GEnx engines, which have collectively logged over 62 million flight hours since entering service in 2011. Like all GE commercial engines, they are certified to operate on approved sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blends.

Leadership Comments

Ghaith Al Ghaith, flydubai CEO, said the new engine deal reinforces the carrier’s long-term vision: “The performance and durability of our engines play an integral role in the success of our operations and expansion plans, especially as we prepare to welcome the Boeing 787 to our fleet. We look forward to a long and successful partnership with GE Aerospace as we embark on the next chapter of growth.”

Russell Stokes, President and CEO of Commercial Engines and Services at GE Aerospace, added: “We are honored by flydubai’s trust in GE Aerospace technology as the airline enters its next phase of growth. The GEnx engines will deliver the reliability and efficiency needed to power flydubai’s first widebody fleet.”

Expanding the Partnership

flydubai’s original order for 30 Dreamliners was placed at the 2023 Dubai Airshow, marking the airline’s first step into widebody operations after more than a decade of exclusively flying narrowbody Boeing jets. The arrival of the 787-9s will enable new long-haul destinations and additional capacity on high-demand markets.

Partnership seeks to tackle barriers to sustainable and equitable solutions, working towards the realization of the Brazil-Japan Joint Crediting Mechanism and paving the way to a long-term offtake agreement for SAF

MoU represents a best-practice model for cross-border climate collaboration, in line with COP30 objectives and UNFCCC Principles.

Abra Group and Sumitomo Corporation do Brasil (Sumitomo), a subsidiary of Sumitomo Corporation, announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to accelerate the identification of industry solutions for decarbonization in the air transport sector.

Under the MoU, Abra – engaged in Brazil via its subsidiary Gol Linhas Aéreas – and Sumitomo will jointly engage with stakeholders, including both the Brazilian and Japanese governments, for the realization of a Brazil-Japan Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement. This will then pave the way for a long-term offtake agreement of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) between Abra and Sumitomo.

Global demand for SAF is expected to reach 400 million tons by 2050, with demand from developed economies with limited feedstock availability, such as Japan, Singapore, and the European Union, placing increasing pressure on the aviation industry to decarbonize. Brazil is well positioned to become a leading global SAF producer, supported by abundant feedstocks, a longstanding ethanol and biodiesel tradition and a strong commitment to renewable energy. However, securing financing for SAF projects – and ensuring Brazilians continued access to essential, affordable, aviation – remain key challenges. The JCM has the potential to bridge these gaps. JCM is Japan’s bilateral carbon offset scheme initiated in 2011, and allows Japan to collaborate with developing economies to accelerate emissions-reduction projects abroad while receiving a proportion of the resulting carbon credits to support its national climate targets.

The combined approach of Abra and Sumitomo provides mutual benefits, while also delivering direct advantages to the Brazilian and Japanese governments, SAF producers in Brazil, domestic airlines and airline customers from both countries.

Mr President,

Congratulations on your election as President of this Conference. I thank the Brazil Government, the City of Belem, and the UNFCCC Secretariat for organising COP30 this year. I also thank your team, Mr President, and the Brazilian Presidency, for your leadership in advancing discussions, and placing the focus of COP30 on the implementation of our global climate agenda.

Climate change continues to outpace the collective response of the global community. 2024 was the warmest year on record, and the first year to be more than 1.5°C above the pre-industrial era. Ocean temperatures have soared to historic heights, and the biggest and most intense coral bleaching episode ever witnessed has spread to more than 80% of the world’s reefs, leading scientists to conclude that the world’s tropical coral reefs have almost certainly crossed a point of no return. This means that Earth has likely reached its first so-called “tipping point”. Storms, floods, heatwaves, and droughts are also becoming more frequent and more intense.

Overlaying this is a backdrop of intensifying geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty. Multilateral cooperation is being put to the test, and the Brazilian Presidency has responded with a call to collective action – the Global Mutirão. This call captures the spirit we need: many actors, working together, focused on real outcomes. Today, Singapore reaffirms our commitment to working with the global community to make collective progress towards our shared climate goals.

Mitigation Efforts

As a small low-lying island state, climate change is an existential challenge for Singapore. This is why we were one of thirteen countries who submitted our 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) by the 10 February 2025 deadline. Our 2035 NDC pledged to reduce our emissions to between 45 to 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2035. The 45 million tonnes target puts us on a linear trajectory to net zero in 2050.

Our 2035 NDC reflects our commitment to climate action. Given our circumstance as an alternative-energy disadvantaged island state, our ability to meet these goals depends on the maturity of mitigation technologies, and effective international collaboration.

Despite our limited land area, we have been pushing hard on solar, which remains our most viable domestic source of renewable energy. We have deployed more than 1.7 gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar to date, quadrupling our solar deployment from 2020. We are on track to meet our target of at least 2GWp of solar deployment by 2030.

To further diversify our low-carbon energy mix, we are establishing a regulatory sandbox to explore biomethane as a low-carbon fuel. In September 2025, the Singapore Economic Development Board issued a closed call for proposals to demonstrate biomethane’s potential for power generation and industrial applications. We are also exploring the potential deployment of nuclear energy.

Singapore is also actively looking to import low-carbon electricity from our region. Last month, Singapore granted conditional approval to import 1GW of low-carbon electricity generated from hydropower from Sarawak, Malaysia. This brings us to about 8GW of potential cross-border electricity trading projects from our region, including from Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Australia.

Beyond power imports, Singapore is advancing the use of low-carbon fuels in the maritime and aviation – sectors central to our role as a global hub. Singapore is exploring methanol and ammonia as low-carbon fuels for the maritime sector. Our Energy Market Authority and Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) appointed a consortium led by Keppel Ltd to work on an end-to-end low-carbon ammonia solution on Jurong Island. If successful, Singapore will be one of the first countries in the world to directly combust ammonia for power generation and deploy ammonia bunkering for international shipping.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has set up a new entity to centrally procure sustainable aviation fuel and secure a more affordable, stable supply for Singapore and the region. From 1 Jan 2026, flights departing from Singapore will be required to use at least 1% of sustainable aviation fuel. Last month, CAAS announced that the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo) has been formed to support the implementation of Singapore’s national sustainable aviation fuel policy.

Adaptation and Resilience Efforts

While we continue to advance mitigation and decarbonisation, Singapore is equally focused on stepping up our adaptation and resilience efforts. Over the next five years, we will develop Singapore’s inaugural National Adaptation Plan to address the physical risks and other impacts of climate change.

Coastal Resilience

30% of Singapore’s land is less than 5m above mean sea level. We are vulnerable to the impact of sea level rise, and have made plans to implement various coastal protection measures progressively over the coming decades. Our national water agency, PUB, completed the first coastal protection site study for the eastern coast of the City. The recommendations from the study, together with the reclamation of ‘Long Island’ – an offshore new island entirely reclaimed from the sea that will protect the entire East Coast area – will form a continuous line of defence to protect City-East Coast against rising sea levels.

The Government will also introduce a Coastal Protection Bill next year, to spell out the responsibilities of stakeholders involved in Coastal Protection, and to provide powers for enforcement and compliance with coastal protection standards. PUB will also launch a code of practice for coastal protection by the first half of 2026 to set standards for the design, construction and operation of coastal protection structures in Singapore.

Heat Resilience

Singapore’s Third National Climate Change Study projects that in the worst case scenario, by the end of this century annual average temperatures in Singapore could rise by up to 5°C, with a sharp increase in days experiencing high heat stress. As such, we are taking proactive steps to strengthen our resilience to heat.

Last year, the Government implemented a revised framework to protect outdoor workers from heat stress, aligning workplace safety measures with the three-tier national Heat Stress Advisory. This framework requires practical safeguards such as regular hydration, rest breaks in shaded areas, and heat acclimatisation, with enforcement through workplace inspections.

This year, Singapore launched a National Heatwave Response Plan, which sets out a coordinated, whole-of-government approach to manage extreme heat events and protect residents, particularly vulnerable groups. While Singapore has not yet experienced heatwaves of the intensity seen in other parts of the world, we are preparing early to manage these risks. Measures like these will ensure that Singapore remains ready to manage the impacts of a warming climate while safeguarding health and livelihoods.

Regional Cooperation

While we continue to push the limits of our domestic efforts, we recognise that our climate goals cannot be achieved in isolation. Southeast Asia is warming faster than the global average, with coastal cities and delta communities facing increasing flood and heat risks. Building regional resilience is therefore critical.

To this end, Singapore is working closely with our neighbours to deepen regional climate science and improve adaptation planning. Researchers from the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Tropical Marine Science Institute are working with other ASEAN countries to study the impact of climate change on the region’s agriculture sector. The study will analyse data on the projected physical impacts of climate change on five agriculture crops: maize, rice, cassava, sugar cane and soya bean, and propose mitigating measures that ASEAN nations can take to address the impact of climate change on the five crops.

In January this year, The Heat Resilience & Performance Centre at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore was officially designated as the Global Heat Health Information Network Southeast Asia Hub, a recognition that underscores its leading role in advancing heat resilience. This designation highlights the Centre’s expertise in addressing the growing challenges of heat-related health risks in the region. With this appointment, the Centre will play a pivotal role in working with the region to shape strategies, research, and policies aimed at mitigating the impact of extreme heat on public health, demonstrating its commitment to building resilience in the face of climate change.

Singapore is also working closely with our partners to realise the ASEAN Power Grid (APG). By interconnecting national grids, the APG will enable low-carbon electricity to flow across borders, balance supply and demand, improve energy security, and advance a shared pathway toward net zero for Southeast Asia.

Last month, ASEAN Energy Ministers endorsed the ASEAN Submarine Power Cables Development Framework Terms of Reference (TOR). When finalised, the framework will support the conduct of subsea route surveys as well as the laying, maintenance, and protection of submarine power cables in Southeast Asia, all of which are crucial to realise the APG. We also welcome initiatives, such as the APG Financing Initiative co-developed by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, to lower financing hurdles and enhance the bankability of cross-border electricity trading projects in the region.

To complement these efforts, the International Energy Agency (IEA) Regional Cooperation Centre in Singapore, which celebrated its first anniversary this October, was established to deepen the IEA’s engagement in the region. Within its first year, the Centre has published numerous reports on clean energy technologies and strengthened its regional partnerships to advance energy transitions. Singapore and the IEA also co-hosted the 9th edition of the Singapore–IEA Regional Training Programme, which brought together more than 200 policymakers and industry leaders from the region to deepen exchanges on cross-border power trading and subsea interconnections.

Singapore has also been engaging our regional partners on technologies that will enable deep decarbonisation. One example is our efforts on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Earlier this year, Singapore signed MoUs with Malaysia and Indonesia on CCS. We are now working towards legally binding bilateral agreements to enable the cross-border transport and storage of carbon dioxide between our countries. Advancing the safe, scalable deployment of CCS solutions will serve as a key pathway for Singapore's hard-to-abate sectors.

Additionally, this year, CAAS launched the Asia-Pacific Sustainable Aviation Centre, to conduct sustainable aviation in the Asia-Pacific region in a pragmatic way that would achieve both development and sustainability goals. It will do so through policy research in areas such as cleaner aviation fuels, carbon accounting, and carbon market development, as well as facilitate collaboration across governments, industry and academia for joint studies and projects to advance sustainable aviation policies and plans for the Asia-Pacific region. The Centre will also support regional capability-building through technical assistance and training in areas of sustainable aviation policy development and implementation.

International Contributions

These regional partnerships demonstrate what multilateral collaboration can achieve. To bring them to scale and deliver real impact, Singapore places great emphasis on the next enabler of implementation – finance. The Baku-to-Belem Roadmap to 1.3 trillion recognises the urgent need to close the global climate finance gap. However, current finance flows fall far short of what is required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.

As a trusted global financial hub, Singapore is doing its part voluntarily to help fill this gap. Our contributions focus on three pillars: capacity building, mobilising blended finance, and strengthening carbon markets.

Capacity Building

Strengthening institutional and technical capabilities is essential to achieving our global climate goals. That is why Singapore supports efforts to build institutional and technical capabilities, including through our contribution to the UNFCCC non-core budget to be earmarked towards the UNFCCC’s proposal for “Supporting Developing Countries in Implementing the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF)”. By strengthening the implementation of the ETF across countries, we help to ensure accountability as developing countries strive to deliver positive climate outcomes. Only when all countries have the systems and capacity to act can global climate finance deliver, and keep the goals of the Paris Agreement within reach.

Blended Finance

Two years ago, at COP28, Singapore Government announced Financing Asia’s Transition Partnership (FAST-P). FAST-P is a blended finance initiative which brings together international public, private and philanthropic partners to support Asia’s green and transition financing needs, and aims to raise US$5 billion. Last year, at COP29, the Singapore Government pledged up to US$500 million concessional capital to match dollar-for-dollar, concessional capital from other partners.

This year, Singapore has made further progress with FAST-P. The Green Investments Partnership has achieved its first closure of projects with US$510 million of committed capital. The capital will be deployed to support green and sustainable infrastructure projects in Southeast and South Asia across a strong pipeline of transactions. The pipeline of projects includes renewable energy and storage, electric vehicles, and water and waste management.

Carbon Markets

Another way in which Singapore aims to direct financing towards climate action is through carbon markets. Carbon markets are a potentially transformational pathway to mobilise private capital to unlock additional emissions reductions while simultaneously funding host countries’ economic development and decarbonisation efforts, as well as unlocking other sustainable development benefits. Singapore takes an ecosystem approach to carbon markets. We are working to boost demand-side confidence, unlock high-integrity supply, and develop the enablers for a high-quality carbon market.

To bolster demand, Singapore is exploring the development of energy transition credits as a novel carbon credit type and financing instrument for the phasing out of coal as a fuel source in Asia. These credits are generated from the emissions reductions attributed to the early retirement of coal plants and their replacement with cleaner energy sources. At COP 28, we convened the Transition Credits Coalition, or TRACTION, comprising over 30 global ecosystem players to identify system-wide barriers and solutions for energy transition credits to be utilised as a credible financing instrument to support the managed and equitable early retirement of coal plants. TRACTION has just released its final report at COP30, outlining practical solutions and identifying key areas for further action to help the industry operationalise and scale the use of energy transition credits.

In parallel, Singapore continues to prioritise nature-based solutions as a vital mitigation and finance pathway. In September this year, we committed to procuring 2.175 million tonnes of Article 6-aligned nature-based carbon credits from four projects in Ghana, Paraguay and Peru at an approximate value of S$76 million or US$58 million. These projects aim to reduce carbon emissions from deforestation, increase carbon sequestration of soil organic carbon stock in grasslands through sustainable management practices, and remove carbon emissions through the reforestation of degraded pastureland.

A well-functioning global carbon market requires more than just compliance credits. Therefore, Singapore is also working to strengthen demand in the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM). In June this year, the Governments of Kenya, Singapore, and the United Kingdom announced the creation of The Coalition to Grow Carbon Markets, a government-led initiative to strengthen voluntary demand for carbon credits. The Coalition comprises ten governments committed to advancing climate action through making clear how businesses can credibly use high-integrity carbon credits in addition to their corporate decarbonisation plans.1 Earlier this month, in São Paulo, the Coalition launched a set of Shared Principles on the voluntary use of high-integrity carbon credits by corporates, responding to calls from businesses for more cohesion and transparency, and stronger, clearer incentives to engage with carbon markets. The Shared Principles will give businesses the confidence they need to invest in carbon markets to support projects relating to sustainable agriculture, clean energy, as well as nature conservation and restoration.

At Singapore International Energy Week in October this year, we also published a VCM guidance to guide Singapore-based companies in their usage of carbon credits as part of a credible decarbonisation plan. This set of guidelines for Singapore-based companies go hand in hand with the Shared Principles. To demonstrate application of the key principles outlined within the VCM guidance, our government agency EnterpriseSG is in discussions with leading corporates in Asia to establish an industry-led buyers’ coalition to align and channel demand towards high-integrity carbon credits in the region and beyond.

To unlock high-integrity supply, Singapore has made international cooperation on Article 6 carbon credits a key focal point. This year, we signed Implementation Agreements (IAs) with eight additional countries – namely, Bhutan, Peru, Chile, Rwanda, Paraguay, Thailand, Vietnam and Mongolia. This brings the total number of IAs Singapore has signed to 10. We continue to work with the host countries to operationalise the IAs, with our latest call for applications being for the Singapore-Peru IA. We look forward to deepening collaboration with these partner countries to mobilise investment in high-quality, high-integrity carbon projects.

In addition to growing demand and supply, Singapore invests in enablers that will underpin a well-functioning carbon market. We are growing a carbon services and trading ecosystem to service and support global carbon markets. To-date, over 150 carbon services and trading firms have established a presence in Singapore. Most recently, the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) expanded its global presence through the launch of its Asia Pacific Hub in Singapore, signalling confidence in our growing position as a trusted carbon services hub. As a global meta standard, ICVCM plays a vital role in strengthening integrity in carbon credits through their Core Carbon Principles, and helping scale the supply of high-quality carbon credits globally.

To strengthen the capacity of financial institutions to play a key enabling role in the carbon market value chain the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has introduced a Financial Sector Carbon Market Development Grant, amounting to S$15 million or US$11.5 million over three years till 2028. This will help support financial institutions to build capabilities for carbon-project financing, trading, insurance and related services; and help defray upfront costs associated with transaction structuring, financing, risk management, and trading of carbon credits.

Conclusion

To conclude, Singapore reaffirms our full support for the COP30 Presidency and the UNFCCC. A decade has passed since the global community adopted the Paris Agreement in 2015.

Strategic partnership between XCF Global and BGN to jointly develop global distribution and logistics infrastructure for SAF and other renewable fuels

Seeks to expand XCF's international reach into key markets including Europe and the Middle East through production, offtake, and co-branded distribution agreements

Advances global renewable fuel supply chains to meet rapidly rising demand for SAF

XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF"") (Nasdaq:SAFX), a leader in advancing the decarbonization of the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (""SAF""), today announced that it has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding(""MOU"") with BGN INT US LLC (""BGN""), a global renewable fuels trading, marketing, and distribution company, to explore developing a global distribution and logistics partnership for SAF, renewable diesel (""RD""), and renewable naphtha (""RN"") (together, ""renewable fuel"").

Under the MOU, XCF and BGN intend to evaluate opportunities to collaborate on renewable fuel production, marketing, and distribution across multiple regions around the world, including Europe and the Middle East. The proposed framework includes offtake and co-branded distribution agreements, as well as joint development of renewable fuel production capacity. In addition, the proposed strategic partnership seeks to promote the use of XCF's SAF within industry trade associations and OEM networks, and throughout the customer value chain.

Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, commented:

""This collaboration represents a critical step in expanding the global reach of renewable fuels. Partnering with BGN would enable us to extend our footprint, streamline logistics, and accelerate commercialization on a global scale with a world-class partner, as we prepare to meet surging demand for sustainable aviation fuel.

""This MOU reflects a shared vision to advance a scalable, commercially viable framework for global renewable fuel production and distribution.""

Cenan Ozmeral, President of BGN Int. US, LLC added:

""We are pleased to be partnering with US based XCF in this exciting venture. BGN and XCF share a common goal to expand access to renewable fuels and accelerate the decarbonization of the aviation industry. Together, we aim to combine XCF's scalable production model with BGN's marketing and distribution network to create a seamless, efficient supply chain from feedstock to finished fuel.

""BGN's trading strength, risk management expertise, and integrated logistics network, will make SAF adoption practical and commercially viable for airlines seeking to meet tightening decarbonization targets. This is a major step, which we believe will have a significant impact on the aviation industry's ability to reduce emissions, in one of the hardest-to-abate transport sectors.""

The collaboration underscores both companies' commitment to building a robust global supply chain at a time when demand for SAF is expanding rapidly. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), airlines will need approximately 165 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2050 to meet net-zero emission targets. Meeting this demand would require the construction of up to 7,000 new facilities worldwide. Analysts project that the global SAF market could exceed $25 billion by 2030 and reach ~$270 billion by 2050, underscoring one of the most compelling growth opportunities in the global energy transition.

This MOU is non-binding, and execution remains subject to customary due diligence, technical validation, and final agreements.

Not for the technology – for the financing structures.

#Aviation is proving what every hard‑to‑abate sector soon learns: 
 
""Decarbonisation isn’t constrained by chemistry, it’s unlocked by finance.""

The SAF market has had to build an entire commercial architecture from scratch; Forging off-take agreements with #airlines, production incentives through mandates and credits, and shared technology risk between developers, investors, and end‑users. 

These mechanisms are now maturing into a #playbook for capital deployment in other carbon‑intensive sectors.

What’s remarkable is that aviation’s first‑mover status is de‑risking the path to net zero far beyond its own boundaries. The financing lessons emerging from #SAF are directly relevant to green hydrogen, #low‑carbon shipping fuels, and even carbon‑neutral steel production.

Sustainability at scale is a finance innovation challenge as much as a technical one; and aviation is quietly leading the way.

The company recently contracted American firm Fluor Corp. to handle front-end engineering and design for its future SAF production hub in North Yorkshire, England.","Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) producer LanzaJet is celebrating the startup of operations and production at its Freedom Pines facility in Soperton, Georgia.

The company says this is the first commercial-scale SAF production plant utilizing ethanol as a feedstock. LanzaJet’s alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) technology has been realized and commercialized through 15 years of research and development.

The Freedom Pines plant development and construction, completed late last year, required about $300 million in investment from LanzaJet and its backers. Among LanzaJet’s investors include aviation firms such as Airbus, British Airways and Southwest Airlines, as well as technology investors including Microsoft.

The Freedom Pines site is expected to produce at least 10 million gallons of ATJ aviation fuel and renewable diesel annually. SAF is designed as a drop-in fuel and to reduce the carbon footprint of jet emissions by 70%.

“This is an important milestone for LanzaJet and our investors, and it's a major win for global aviation – perhaps serving as a beacon of hope for the future,” Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet, said in a statement. “Our story at LanzaJet is one of impact – building a new industry, creating value, and delivering on our commitments regardless of obstacles in our way. We're now in a unique position with technology and operational know-how to shape this global industry in the decade ahead.""

The technology is designed to work with a broad range of sustainable feedstocks, including agricultural residues, energy crops, municipal solid waste, and captured carbon, to deliver lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reductions as compared to conventional jet fuel. Upon blending with Jet A-1 fuel, a fully certified solution compatible with existing aircraft and infrastructure is formed.

Freedom Pines is one of LanzaJet’s planned SAF production sites globally.

From 1 October 2026, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will introduce a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) charge for travellers departing the country.

The SAF levy will apply to all tickets or services sold from 1 April 2026, including cargo shipments and business flights.

Charges will vary based on the distance travelled by an air passenger and the cabin of travel, and will be categorised by four geographical bands.

Group one includes Southeast Asia; group two comprises Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia and Papua New Guinea; Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Pacific Islands and New Zealand are in group three and group four includes the Americas.

For example, economy class passengers will pay S$1 (58 pence) for flights to Bangkok, S$2.80 (£1.65) for journeys to Tokyo, S$6.40 (£3.75) for flights to London and S$10.40 (£6) to New York.

Prices will be shown by airlines as a “distinct line item” on the air ticket sold.

The levy will not apply to passengers who are only transiting through Singapore.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has set a goal of net-zero carbon emissions for international aviation by 2050. Singapore said it is “committed to working towards that goal and will do so in a practical manner.”

Mr Han Kok Juan, director general of CAAS, said: “The introduction of the SAF Levy marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub. It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub.

“We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust”.

The news comes as a £500 levy for business travellers was proposed at Cop30, the climate summit, last week.

The governments of France, Spain and Kenya demanded “a special focus on premium flyers” with the proceeds of a levy going to “resilient investments and fair transitions”.

But the International Air Transport Association dismissed the idea from the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force as “crazy”.","https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/17/10/22/iStock-1766337179.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-11-17 10:58:38.188289

“If Germany wants to become greener in transport, it has to set the correct scene to allow for additional investment,” a third source told Fastmarkets.
Unclear policy guidance and delays in RED III transitioning to become national law could increase import flows of advanced biofuels from third countries, raising concerns about its legitimacy and creating competition within the German market, other sources said.
“Some countries are implementing [RED III] next year, while others are not and that affects us quite a lot,” he said.
But any delays next door in Belgium could hinder progress in the Netherlands because implementation would give the Belgians an “unfair competition advantage,” sources said.","Biofuel feedstocks traders have reported lower-than-usual trade over the past few weeks, with market participants holding off from actively trading first-quarter 2026 positions in the expectation of long-awaited clarity on policy changes. And Fastmarkets understands that biodiesel activity in Germany has also been quiet, given the uncertainty.

“It’s getting ridiculous,” a source based in Europe said. “The EU countries had so much time to implement RED III and now, when it is due on January 1, they keep delaying the final decisions, making trade nearly impossible.”

The original deadline for the implementation of RED III, which sets a target for Europe to increase the share of renewable energy in its overall energy mix to at least 42.5% by 2030, was set at the EU level and passed on May 21 this year. However, no member state met this deadline, and some then set out to implement by January 1, 2026.

“The timeframe to reach the January 1 implementation date is getting smaller and smaller,” a second source told Fastmarkets. “And the plan seems to be that it will be agreed early next year, with most of the regulations implemented retroactively.”

The source acknowledged that while not everything could be backdated if implementation was further delayed – pointing to the exclusion of palm oil mill effluent (POME) and witness audits, neither of which will become valid until 2027 – “all the other regulations, especially the ban on [feedstock] double counting, could be introduced retroactively.”

Other market participants raised concerns about the prospect that RED III implementation could be delayed for another year, because the German market, which is a major biofuel-producing hub, would then remain in the same “poor condition” for longer.

“If Germany wants to become greener in transport, it has to set the correct scene to allow for additional investment,” a third source told Fastmarkets.

Unclear policy guidance and delays in RED III transitioning to become national law could increase import flows of advanced biofuels from third countries, raising concerns about its legitimacy and creating competition within the German market, other sources said.

“The option of double-counting advanced biofuels must be eliminated as quickly as possible, as proposed in the draft legislation. It is precisely this option that incentivizes fraudulent activity,” according to German waste biofuels association MVaK.

MVaK has consistently said the fraud prevention measures, which are part of the draft legislation and focus on the import of advanced biofuels, must be implemented as soon as possible, because “market participants must know immediately what obligations they have to fulfil under the greenhouse gas reduction quota in 2026 and what options are available to them.”

Calls for swift action

Earlier this week, Torsten Krawczyk, the chairman of the German Union for the Promotion of Oil and Protein Crops (UFOP), expressed concerns about the delays to RED III implementation and called for swift action, describing the delay in inter-ministerial coordination as “incomprehensible and irresponsible.”

UFOP has called on the German parliament and the second chamber for immediate action on sustainable certification for imported biofuels, feedstock use regulation, including catch crops and the cultivation of degraded land, as well as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

At a recent industry event in Sweden, Fastmarkets found a widespread lack of clarity about progress on the implementation of RED III and a biodiesel and feedstocks industry shrouded in uncertainty after the recent collapse of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) talks.

Joachim Elm, a feedstocks trader at Swedish energy firm ST1, which produces hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and SAF, said last month that a lack of clarity was problematic. “Some countries are implementing [RED III] next year, while others are not and that affects us quite a lot,” he said. “How do you supply feedstock in an uncertain and unsure regulatory environment? How do you know what type of feedstock you need to buy and if you can form partnerships or if you need to go to the spot market?”

In late July, the European Commission announced that it would take action against 26 member states for failing to communicate the measures they had adopted to implement the latest iteration of RED III.

While several member states have taken steps toward introducing the transport element of the directive, legislation implementing the whole framework remains limited, with many countries not yet even providing a definitive timeframe for the full adoption of RED III.

In the Netherlands, a debate on RED III and vote in the Senate are expected in early December, once the state secretary responds to questions from the Senate, making the Netherlands’ original target for transposition of January 1 as still achievable, Fastmarkets understands.

But any delays next door in Belgium could hinder progress in the Netherlands because implementation would give the Belgians an “unfair competition advantage,” sources said.",https://www.fastmarkets.com/tachyon/2025/07/greenenergy-immingham-biofuel-plant.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 10:58:50.391417

From carbon capture to green steel, IDTechEx's research encompasses a wide range of existing innovative technologies with the potential to decarbonize the planet. However, costs are generally higher compared with the fossil fuel status quo and delivering to early adopters isn't always straightforward. Therefore, creative market mechanisms are needed, unlocking green technologies for buyers across a wide range of sectors and geographies.

Renewable energy certificates

Renewable energy can provide the blueprint. While as of today, wind and solar technologies can be cheaper than fossil fuels on a $/MWh basis, cost reductions were only enabled by widespread deployment. This scale up was driven by Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) markets, which accounted for the ""green premium"" associated with low-carbon renewables. When RECs are sold, what's transferred is not the electricity produced but the attributes that make it clean energy. When companies buy RECs, they provide financial support for the renewable energy projects that produce them, boosting the business case.

According to IDTechEx's ""Sustainability for Data Centers"" report, some of the world's largest companies - including Amazon and Apple - already voluntarily purchase large amounts of renewable power attributes each year. But renewable electricity is only part of the battle when it comes to combatting the climate crisis. What about technologies that can address legacy emissions or non-power related CO2 sources?

Carbon credits for carbon dioxide removal

Reaching global net-zero by 2050 targets will require large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR) beyond the planet's natural sinks to tackle residual emissions. For the highest quality, durable, carbon dioxide removals, voluntary corporate purchasers have again enabled green market creation. In the form of carbon credits, carbon dioxide removal offers a pathway to address scope 3 supply chain emissions and even achieve carbon negativity. This market has grown rapidly. In 2022, fewer than a million tonnes of credits were sold, but in 2025 a single deal can easily exceed 5 million tonnes. Microsoft has been an indisputably powerful driving force here, accounting for 80% of all durable carbon dioxide removal credit purchases.

Many carbon dioxide removal technologies have been monetized in the form of carbon credits, including direct air capture, enhanced rock weathering, and biochar. According to IDTechEx's carbon dioxide removal forecasting, over 100 million tonnes of durable, engineered carbon dioxide removal per year could be delivered by 2035.

Currently, most deals in the carbon dioxide removal space are pre-purchases. Instead of making an equity investment, these pre-purchasers are committing to buy a product early to bring it to market faster, despite the current high cost. This illustrates clear demand and creates market signals, spurring investment into first-of-a-kind CDR demonstration projects.

Environmental attributes certificates for green cement

Cement accounts for 8% of global CO2 emissions. Decarbonization of cement will require more than just electrification, due to underlying process CO2 emissions associated with limestone. There are many innovative solutions being developed, as analyzed in IDTechEx's ""Decarbonization of Cement 2025-2035"" research. These include new raw materials, new cement chemistries, and new cement production processes.

Driving factors such as the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and the desire for greener data centers as AI booms are sparking commercial scale up for innovative green cement players. For example, in 2025 Microsoft announced it has signed an agreement with Sublime Systems (an electrochemical cement start-up) to buy up to 623,000 tonnes of low-carbon cement from Sublime's future facilities. One of the challenges faced by nascent green cement developers is that early offtakers won't always be physically located near pilot and demonstration facilities. To address this, the Microsoft-Sublime deal gives Microsoft not only the option to physically deploy cement when geographically possible, but Microsoft will also be able to purchase the environmental attribute certificates (EACs) of Sublime cement separately.

This chain of custody model, known as 'book and claim', learns key lessons from renewable energy markets and decouples the low carbon intensity of the cement from the physical unit. Alexis Olans Haass, Managing Director of EU Market Development, reported to IDTechEx that EACs ""ensure demand can materialize"", enabling flexibility for offtakers, and allowing green cement projects to come online that ""otherwise wouldn't have been built"".

The book and claim model is not limited to cement. Other decarbonization areas benefitting from this model include sustainable aviation fuel and green steel. Sublime Systems is hopeful that the groundwork built with Microsoft could lead to ""cross-pollination across industries that can benefit all.""

Outlook

Many technologies required for global decarbonization already exist. The challenge lies in how to open green markets to early adopters, laying the foundation for widespread uptake. From the scale-up of wind and solar over the past 50 years, the value of decoupling environmental benefits form physical geography is clear. CDR carbon credit markets have demonstrated how rapidly green markets can be scaled up through advanced market commitments and demand signals. While carbon credit and REC markets have not been free from controversy, new green markets focused on measurability and additionality can accelerate climate action globally.",https://idtxs3.imgix.net/si/50000/0C/00.png?w=1200&h=627&fit=fill&bg=ffffff&border=0,N,,2025-11-17 11:56:45.531515

AAPA director general Subhas Menon, who was speaking at the closing of the association’s 69th assembly of presidents, notes that demand remains “very buoyant” in the near term.

Menon says the sector has demonstrated “resilience” amid “persistent” challenges such geopolitics and supply chain issues, with passenger traffic up 10% in the first nine months of the year.

The AAPA says traffic will continue to grow in the new year, supported by “resilient economies and strong passenger and cargo demand”.

Its projections also indicate that in 2026, intra-Asia traffic is expect to see the largest growth, while sectors like North America-Asia are expected to see slower growth.

This is reflective of AAPA’s data comparing traffic growth in August and September, which shows North America-Asia traffic growth slowly down sharply. The “less buoyant” demand “reflects the impact of tariffs and policy changes”, the association notes.

The US-imposed tariffs, which are at risk of being escalated further, “could further exacerbate” supply chain “bottlenecks”, notes Menon.

“Stakeholders across the aviation ecosystem must work together to navigate the evolving challenges of the external environment. The assembly reaffirmed the industry’s unity and determination to navigate global uncertainty,” Menon states.

This year’s assembly of presidents passed four resolutions, covering areas such as sustainability, supply chain and taxation.

It affirmed its “aspirational target” of 5% sustainable aviation fuel use by 2030 – set in 2023 – and called on governments to “establish policy and regulations to accelerate SAF production”.

On supply chain, AAPA member carriers called for “targeted investment incentives” in the MRO and manufacturing sectors.

The assembly also called on regulators to “refrain from imposing taxed or charges on international air transport that are not cost-related or consistent with ICAO guidance”.

Regulators should also “align practices” with global guidelines for the safe carriage of spare lithium batteries, with Menon noting that the lack of “harmonisation” of standards.

He adds: “Airlines are left to their own devices, and each airline is doing their own thing, which is very confusing for passengers.”

Although he stressed the UAE’s cautious approach to SAF, the country “really wants to hit the ground running” when it comes to adopting and producing SAF.
We have the soft power to drive this on a global scale,” Al Olama said.
“We are hoping it's going to be a major success, and if this project does come through, I see it as a blueprint that we can apply immediately in the UAE,” Al Olama said.","DUBAI—The UAE is working toward making the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandatory in the country as a key component of its SAF policy roadmap, says Sharif Al Olama, undersecretary for energy and petroleum affairs at the ministry of energy and infrastructure.

Today, the “soft requirement” is for carriers to uplift 1% SAF on a voluntary basis by 2031, but the government is working with Gulf carriers and other stakeholders to bring in a SAF mandate making it compulsory, Al Olama told Aviation Week prior to a meeting of the UAE government’s SAF & LCAF (Low Carbon Aviation Fuel) Executive Committee hosted by Airbus on Nov. 17 here at the Dubai Airshow.

“When we launched the [voluntary] policy, we wanted to test the water with our national airlines and test the environment to see the acceptance of utilizing SAF,” Al Olama said.

The government is now moving to the next phase of understanding what the impact of a SAF mandate would be on airlines and how additional costs would be passed on to consumers.

“We are very cautious when it comes to getting new policies or new mandatory requirements on board because we are aware that there can be some impact on the operations of our national airlines, so we really need to strike that balance,” Al Olama said.

Although he stressed the UAE’s cautious approach to SAF, the country “really wants to hit the ground running” when it comes to adopting and producing SAF. “Whenever we see there is a global need, the UAE takes the lead. We have the soft power to drive this on a global scale,” Al Olama said.

One initiative the UAE government is pursuing is a bid, alongside UK-based Chinook Hydrogen, to develop a SAF production plant at Hong Kong International Airport, he said.

“We are hoping it's going to be a major success, and if this project does come through, I see it as a blueprint that we can apply immediately in the UAE,” Al Olama said.

The UAE is “very pragmatic” when it comes to sustainability policy and planning, said Gabriel Sémelas, president for Africa and Middle East at Airbus.

“There is a great alignment between the government, the regulators, the local entities, all the technicians doing all the work required and industry,” Sémelas added. “I think this is unique.

This goal requires significant investment, government support, and collaboration across the industry, as the current pace of change, especially with SAF, is insufficient to meet the target on its own.

The future of aviation net zero by 2050 relies on a multi-pronged approach, with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and International Air Transport Association (IATA) setting the goal, but progress is slow. Key strategies include increasing the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs), developing new technologies like electric and hydrogen-powered aircraft, improving operational efficiencies, and using carbon offsets for remaining emissions. Challenges include limited SAF production, high costs, and the need for significant government support and industry-wide cooperation.

Replacing conventional jet fuel with SAFs is seen as a critical solution, with a goal of SAFs accounting for about 65% of total emissions reductions by 2050. It is also viable for the development and use of hydrogen-powered and electric aircraft for zero-emission flights. Improving flight paths, air traffic management, and airport operations are also solutions to reduce fuel burn and emissions. There is scope for utilizing credible offsetting schemes and carbon capture technologies to neutralize any remaining emissions that cannot be eliminated at the source.

The development and deployment of solutions like SAFs are not happening fast enough to meet the 2050 target, reports Indian Aerospace and Defence Bulletin and the IEA. The transition requires significant investment and government policy support, which are not yet happening at the anticipated pace and scale, notes the IATA. The climate impact of non-CO2 emissions from aviation also needs to be addressed, which adds another layer of complexity to the problem.

The global air transport sector is working towards achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Yes, decarbonizing a sector so heavily reliant on fossil fuels is a monumental challenge, but it also poses an opportunity as it allows us to reimagine the way we travel in the not-so-distant future: aircraft will be powered by new propulsion systems which reduce fuel use or rely on more electric architectures, while sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, will need to fuel the majority of flights taking off around the world.

But the way to get there is difficult, requiring enormous efforts by all stakeholders. There is no silver bullet to get to net zero and different stakeholders and regions in the world will contribute in different ways. Some will lead through large-scale deployment of sustainable aviation fuel, while others will pioneer hydrogen, hybrid and electric propulsion systems. Together, these efforts are converging into one shared journey: transforming the vision of tomorrow’s flight into today’s reality.

At the heart of this transformation lies the shift from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources. Sustainable aviation fuel, which can be produced from feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues, algae or even captured carbon, can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%. But the challenge is to scale it: this fuel currently represents less than 1% of global jet fuel use. To meet 2050 targets, production must increase exponentially, requiring the creation of an entirely new energy ecosystem. That means new refineries and supply chains as well as harmonised regulations around the globe and investment and financial frameworks.",https://www.bizzbuzz.news/h-upload/2025/11/17/1981296-aviatons-net-zero-future.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 04:57:06.083972

LanzaJet invested more than USD 300 million in building and operating the plant, which employed more than 300 workers during construction.

LanzaJet’s ATJ process can use a wide range of sustainable feedstocks, including agricultural residues, energy crops, municipal waste and captured carbon. The resulting fuel, when blended with Jet A-1, is fully certified for use in existing aircraft and infrastructure.

The facility serves as a blueprint for future commercial deployment of the technology. LanzaJet said it is already working with partners in the United States, Australia, Japan, India, the United Kingdom, Colombia, the European Union, the Middle East and Kazakhstan to scale SAF production.

The company’s work builds on earlier demonstrations dating back to 2012, when ethanol-to-jet technology first emerged from LanzaTech’s research programme. The pathway was approved by ASTM in 2016, enabling commercial test flights with Virgin Atlantic and All Nippon Airways in 2018 and 2019.",https://www.fuelsandlubes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cropped-icon-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-17 04:57:35.838125

A Shift from Offsets to SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuels) Some airlines have already started making changes.","Big European airlines, like Lufthansa and Air France, are changing their tune about carbon offsetting for flights. About 21 of them have now agreed to stop making environmental claims that don't quite add up. This pledge, announced by the European Commission, is timed with Brazil's UN COP30 climate conference (10-21 Nov), really highlighting how serious the EU is about stopping greenwashing in the skies.

Cracking Down on Vague Promises

These promises are a result of talks among the airlines, the Commission, and groups watching out for consumers. Airlines are saying they'll quit saying things like a flight's CO2 can be totally ""neutralized"" just because passengers throw money at climate projects or SAF, or so-called sustainable aviation fuel.

Airlines will need to steer clear of general, unclear language and actually prove any future environmental claims with hard facts and timelines to prevent any more tricky marketing. They're being told to show CO2 numbers clearly, so passengers can see the climate footprint of their trips.

One Commission person said, ""This fits perfectly with what people are pushing for at COP30: real climate action. Aviation needs to be upfront, not just hype, so people can trust sustainable travel.""

The Full List of Committed Carriers

The Commission has shared the full list of the 21 European airlines involved, everything from your main flag carriers to the budget ones. They've all promised to get moving on these changes:

These airlines carry a huge amount of Europe's air traffic, and their collective agreement could totally change the way the industry talks about being green.

Roots in Consumer Complaints and Legal Precedents

These pledges come after a warning in June 2023 by the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC), calling out 17 airlines for claims that weren't really true. BEUC said that these airlines were tricking passengers into thinking their flights were eco-friendly when really, they were still adding to aviation's big carbon problem.

These airlines have been in trouble before too. Back in March 2024, a Dutch court ruled against KLM for ads that were ""vague"" and made sustainability seem better than it was. Air France was also rapped on the knuckles by the UK's Advertising Standards Authority in 2023 over Google ads that talked about eco-friendly travel. Lufthansa even had to take down some posters in Belgium way back in July 2022 after they implied that flying was good for the planet.

These decisions are pushing the industry to focus on real progress instead of just flashy marketing.

A Shift from Offsets to SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuels)

Some airlines have already started making changes. Air France and KLM stopped doing carbon offsetting three years ago because people said they weren't really working and didn't reduce emissions directly. These schemes generally involved planting trees.

According to the Commission, ""An Air France-KLM person said the group is now buying SAF."" Sustainable Aviation Fuel, made from waste stuff or crops you don't eat, is a more direct way to reduce carbon, even though it's not easy to get enough of it. The industry is clearly moving towards real innovations, at least.

COP30 and a Path to Reality

With COP30 on the horizon, hosted in Brazil, the EU's move acts as a pertinent message that corporate responsibility should keep pace with government aims. The Commission's goal, to boost consumer choice via clearer rules, could speed up the aviation sector's 2050 net-zero target.

The announcement was met with approval, with environmental groups like BEUC calling it ""a long-overdue victory."" They stressed that successful enforcement is key, though. With these new commitments, perhaps Europe's skies will become less polluted by just ""talk,"" and more so with reality, even as offsets face regulatory uncertainty.",https://www.tourism-review.com/temp/aktualita-detail-facebook_tmb_15190.webp,N,,2025-11-17 04:57:41.749667

A global engine shop Since those tenuous early days, Wagner has overseen the significant expansion of MTU Maintenance Zhuhai’s facilities.
Quality and safety are paramount, so a company such as MTU Maintenance Zhuhai must make trust its currency.
In 2025, MTU Maintenance Zhuhai took an important step in that direction by testing engines using sustainable aviation fuel – a first for the Chinese facility.
Every person in the MTU Maintenance Zhuhai extended family is different, he adds, and everyone needs a different approach.","Gert Wagner couldn’t have had a rougher start to his new role as President and CEO. Tasked with leading the team at MTU Maintenance Zhuhai, the aviation veteran found himself in the middle of an unprecedented global pandemic.

""I remember when I arrived, the doors of the aircraft opened and I saw all these people in blue uniforms wearing masks,"" he tells The CEO Magazine. ""I felt like I was in an outbreak movie.""

It was a sobering introduction that took a little of the sheen off Wagner’s new role. He joined MTU Aero Engines, the leading German aerospace company listed in the German DAX, in 2005, and held several positions within the company until the move to China arose.

""Everybody was sick; we had something like a 60 percent absence rate, so it was very hard to run the company at first,"" he recalls. ""But once people came back, so did a big demand, and we’ve grown dramatically ever since. Now, we’re running at full speed and it’s a very exciting time.""

A global engine shop

Since those tenuous early days, Wagner has overseen the significant expansion of MTU Maintenance Zhuhai’s facilities. Just in March 2025, the team celebrated the opening of a second facility.

""That brings us close to being one of the biggest engine shops in the world, capacity-wise,"" he says.

In collaboration with

China Aviation Supplies

The company is streamlining services and supplies in the aviation industry. The company is streamlining services and supplies in the aviation industry.

In 2024, MTU had 500 shop visits. The recent expansions have given the firm the capacity for up to 710 shop visits in the future.

""We’re very confident about filling those shops,"" Wagner says.

""The market is there within the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation alone. Boeing and Airbus are forecasting for the next 20 years their fleets to double, with 80 percent narrow-body aircraft.

""We have all major narrow-body engines in our facility, so now it’s up to us to convince our customers through our performance and our expertise to send their engines to us along with their faith and trust.""

And it’s trust that keeps aviation maintenance airborne. Quality and safety are paramount, so a company such as MTU Maintenance Zhuhai must make trust its currency. Fortunately, Wagner says that’s its strength.

""Everything is prepared for growth,"" he says. ""We have the right capacity, the right people on board; the market is there. I’m very confident.""

Key relationships

Filling those shops requires a world-class parts supply chain backed by a peerless global logistics network, with many services sourced locally. From endoscope supplier Everest VIT Beijing and tooling provider Dedienne Aerospace to aviation supplies firm China Aviation Supplies Co and surface treatment leader John Cockerill, MTU Maintenance Zhuhai has a stable of industry heavyweights in its corner.

""In the supply chain, the most important relationship you have in our business is with the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs),"" Wagner says.

""I’ve been in this business for over 20 years and I know all the OEMs. I have personal relationships with them. That communication and networking are key, because when you have a problem, you have to know who to talk to. Suddenly, the market isn’t so big.""

Wagner says that in a high-pressure environment such as aeronautical engineering, fairness is still a factor.

""To keep long-term relationships going, you have to understand these OEMs have their limits,"" he says. ""You have to treat them fairly.""

Sustainability and leadership goals

That close collaboration with a diverse range of OEMs also gives MTU access to a broad spectrum of innovation – especially when it comes to sustainability.

""That’s a big topic for all the OEMs,"" Wagner says. ""They’re all developing concepts to reduce emissions and maybe one day become emission neutral, so the main thing we can do is prepare our customers for using sustainable aviation fuel.""

In 2025, MTU Maintenance Zhuhai took an important step in that direction by testing engines using sustainable aviation fuel – a first for the Chinese facility. ""We’re the first MRO shop in China able to offer this,"" he says.

""It’s a big achievement and a big step forward. It can change our industry.""

With so much at stake, from safety to innovation, Wagner says leadership in this industry is a surprisingly simple matter.

""For me, it’s down to two quotes. Jack Welch said, ‘It’s all about people,’ while Peter Drucker said, ‘A culture eats strategy for breakfast’. As a leader, you have to inject a healthy culture into your organization and you have to take care of your people. They make it happen, so you have to treat them well.""

Every person in the MTU Maintenance Zhuhai extended family is different, he adds, and everyone needs a different approach.

""There’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,"" he says. ""You have to gain trust and they have to believe you’re leading the organization in the right direction.""

Wagner’s trial by fire in the midst of the worst industry crisis since the September 11 attacks went a long way toward building that trust.

""It’s very different than right now, which is very comfortable. We have full order books and it’s all very positive, but that’s a different kind of leadership,"" he says.

""In a crisis, you have to lead from the top; you have to be there and demonstrate confidence so they can trust you. At the moment, I’m leading from the back, making sure everyone’s going in the right direction.

""Leadership is about adjusting to the situation and the people you deal with.""

Originally a mechanical engineer himself, Wagner says he loves being a part of such a high-tech industry.

""There’s nothing better,"" he says. ""We’re at the leading edge of technology and not on a small scale. Two of the most modern aircraft engines are here in our shop.

""Technology and people are such a fascinating combination and it’s why I love this business so much. It couldn’t be better.""",https://static.theceomagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/17094306/Gert-Wagner_MTU-MAINTENANCE_Sharing.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 04:58:16.845737

From cutting-edge energy initiatives and electrified ground operations to carbon-reduction strategies, the showcase underlines how efficiency and environmental responsibility go hand in hand.

The OneDXB Sustainability Alliance, which launched in September 2024, brings together seven founding partners—Dubai Airports, Emirates, flydubai, dnata, Dubai Duty Free, Emirates Flight Catering and Dubai Air Navigation Services. The goal is simple yet ambitious: to accelerate collective decarbonization efforts and set new sustainability benchmarks for the region and wider global aviation ecosystem.

“At DXB, we work with hundreds of partners, but the idea behind OneDXB is to create a focused alliance that collaborates on how we decarbonize in the short term and how we plan for future sustainable aviation strategies,” says Sven Deckers, Dubai Airports' head of sustainability.

With Dubai Airports in the midst of master-planning the next-generation mega-hub at Al Maktoum International (DWC), sustainability is being built into the project from the ground up. “As much as we need to look at how we decarbonize today, we must also think across the whole aviation ecosystem—10, 20, or 30 years ahead,” Deckers adds.

Integrated Sustainability in Action

OneDXB’s Sustainable Turnaround Showcase offers visitors a unique, integrated experience that brings together around 35 partners and 45 pieces of equipment in a compact, 20-min. walkthrough. “Rather than visiting 30 or 40 separate stands, delegates can see the full picture of sustainable aviation, from the airport operator to airlines, ground handlers, and service providers, all in one place,” Deckers says.

The showcase includes a flydubai aircraft positioned on site to demonstrate a fully electrified turnaround, illustrating how ground operations can dramatically cut emissions. From electric fire trucks and autonomous vehicles to solar-powered systems and dry-washing technology, the display reflects real-world progress as well as what’s coming next.

“It’s not about showing off,” Deckers says. “It’s about showing what can be done—and inviting others to join the conversation. So, we encourage visitors to come to our stand and see for themselves. This is the start of something big.”

Among the technologies being showcased are multiple alternative-fuel solutions, including biofuels and hydrogen. Dubai Airports is already deploying biofuel in its operations, while also exploring hydrogen-powered ground transport—including a fully licensed hydrogen bus here at the show. Thanks to the Dubai Airports’ partnership with Airbus, visitors can also see a physical model of a hydrogen powerplant cell, part of the manufacturer’s research into zero-emission flight.

“There’s no single solution to aviation’s net-zero goal,” Deckers says. “It’s about a combination of many actions—electrification, biofuels, hydrogen and new operational efficiencies—each one moving the needle further.”

The UAE’s potential to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is another focus area. A truck on display demonstrates how used cooking oil collected across the UAE can be converted into SAF and biofuel. Meanwhile, research into power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels highlights how the region’s abundance of solar energy and desalination capacity could make it a future global hub for synthetic fuel production.

For Dubai Airports, the road to net zero involves a three-pillar approach: decarbonizing DXB through proven technologies such as solar panels, LED lighting

and HVAC optimization; trialing future solutions at DWC, which serves as an innovation testbed; and embedding sustainability into the design and operations of the upcoming DWC mega-hub.

“Unlike other major airports, the Dubai Airports setup gives us the unique opportunity to test in a live environment at DWC and design the airport of the future from scratch,” Deckers says.

“The future will be more sustainable, and we’re working today to define what that looks like.”",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-11-17 04:58:22.299826

Thankfully, scientists have found a sustainable way to cut that contribution by turning everyday trash into jet fuel.

A study published in Nature Sustainability shows that converting municipal solid waste into sustainable aviation fuel could reduce pollution by 80-90% compared to conventional jet fuel. The findings support that one day, food scraps and packaging could power commercial flights.

Researchers from the U.S. and China found that trash-based jet fuel could account for 62.5 billion liters annually, enough to cut global aviation pollution by 16%, as Anthropocene Magazine reported.

""There is a wealth of organic waste deserving our attention,"" said research team member Michael McElroy, an environmental studies professor at Harvard University.

In addition to waste, the Nature Sustainability study also noted that integrating green hydrogen into the process could remove even more carbon, while the biggest hurdle is improving the gasification process, which has been a ""technical challenge.""

For cities already struggling with landfill waste, this breakthrough could turn that problem into a climate solution.

This isn't the only recent advancement in sustainable aviation technology. Scientists at Chalmers University in Sweden presented hydrogen-powered aircraft designs that could reduce fuel consumption. Meanwhile, aviation company Eviation introduced Alice, the world's first all-electric commuter plane, last year.

Choosing low-impact travel options helps support this transition. While no single solution can fully replace dirty-energy-producing fuel just yet, innovations such as waste-based sustainable aviation fuel and electric aircraft are taking us in the right direction.

Despite persistent geopolitical and trade tensions, AAPA members registered robust international air traffic performance. International passenger traffic for Asia Pacific carriers rose 10% in the first nine months of 2025, while air cargo demand expanded 7%, outpacing global averages.

“Asia Pacific airlines continue to demonstrate agility in managing supply chain constraints, with capacity growth keeping pace with demand,” said AAPA Director General Subhas Menon: “However, further escalation of tariffs could exacerbate these bottlenecks.”

The assembly brought together airline leaders, manufacturers, and industry partners to address key industry priorities, including supply chain resilience, the deployment of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and enhancing workforce resilience.

“Stakeholders across the aviation ecosystem must work together to navigate the evolving challenges of the external environment. The assembly reaffirmed the industry’s unity and determination to navigate global uncertainty, much as it did during the pandemic,” Menon added.

Assembly Resolutions Passed

The Assembly of Presidents unanimously passed several resolutions addressing key industry priorities.

Aviation Sustainability

The assembly affirmed a collective target of 5% SAF utilisation by 2030, called on governments to support fuel suppliers by establishing policy and regulations to accelerate SAF production, and to adopt ICAO CORSIA-eligible fuel criteria. The resolution further urged states to implement ICAO-approved SAF accounting and registry systems, as well as support cost-effective production pathways, such as co-processing.

Supply Chain Strengthening

The assembly called for targeted investment incentives and regulatory harmonisation to enhance regional MRO and manufacturing capabilities. It also supported the adoption of circular economy principles, including recycling and reuse of serviceable aircraft materials.

Aviation Safety

A resolution focused on lithium batteries was passed, calling on regulators to align practices with ICAO guidance for the safe carriage of spare lithium batteries, and to enhance data sharing and public outreach materials on the carriage and usage of lithium batteries by passengers.

Taxes and Charges

The assembly called on regulators to refrain from imposing taxes or charges on international air transport that are not cost-related or consistent with ICAO guidance, cautioning against measures that add an unnecessary financial burden on airlines or which impede sustainable air transport growth.

Outlook for 2026

AAPA expects international passenger traffic to continue expanding in line with long-term trends, supported by a growing services sector and rising regional connectivity. The outlook for air cargo demand remains broadly positive. Still, it is subject to uncertainties stemming from global trade policies and elevated costs, including those resulting from new US tariffs and limited SAF availability.

PDO, which is majority state-owned, currently produces approximately 948,600 cubic meters of produced water daily—this highly saline, oil-contaminated water emerges alongside crude oil.
The partially treated water proceeds to evaporation ponds that concentrate and reduce the volume further.
This comprehensive system effectively removes the majority of oil, producing treated water that is suitable for various beneficial uses.
Several Omani start-ups, alongside international companies, are exploring opportunities to produce biofuels and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by cultivating select crops irrigated with treated produced water.","MUSCAT, NOV 16 — Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), the Sultanate’s largest oil and gas producer, has taken a pioneering step to create value from the enormous volumes of produced water generated by its daily oilfield operations. The company has invited interested firms to register their interest in utilizing treated produced water for agricultural, industrial, and other commercial applications.

PDO, which is majority state-owned, currently produces approximately 948,600 cubic meters of produced water daily—this highly saline, oil-contaminated water emerges alongside crude oil. This volume is equivalent to filling about 380 Olympic-sized swimming pools every day and is expected to increase to 1.4 million cubic meters per day (around 560 Olympic-sized pools) by 2030.

To manage these vast quantities sustainably and maximize their value within Oman, PDO plans to invite local and international companies to submit techno-commercial proposals for the use of treated water from two major treatment facilities located at Nimr and Rima within its concession area. As an initial step, interested parties must prequalify by submitting their expressions of interest no later than December 21, 2025.

The Nimr Wetlands, established in 2010, are among the world’s largest constructed wetlands for treating produced water, with a current capacity of about 175,000 cubic meters per day. The Rima Water Treatment Plant has a treatment capacity of up to 65,000 cubic meters per day.

At both plants, produced water undergoes a multi-stage treatment process. First, oil is separated from the water, which then passes through extensive reed bed wetlands where plants and microbes naturally break down remaining contaminants. The partially treated water proceeds to evaporation ponds that concentrate and reduce the volume further. In some cases, an additional polishing step enhances water quality. This comprehensive system effectively removes the majority of oil, producing treated water that is suitable for various beneficial uses.

Recently, PDO has intensified efforts to identify market-driven solutions for expanding the beneficial reuse of treated produced water across sectors such as agriculture, wetland development, biodiversity enhancement, and other industrial, commercial, and mineral extraction activities.

At Nimr, a portion of treated water has been successfully used to irrigate crops like cotton, Ricinus (castor), and jojoba, which yield valuable downstream products such as biological oils for further processing. Native tree species such as eucalyptus are also thriving, indicating strong potential for scaling up agricultural operations in the area.

In addition, projects focused on extracting salts and minerals from the water have been pursued. Noteworthy initiatives include the Fahud Salt Making Project, the Qarn Alam Steam Hypersaline Project, and the use of surface water to support plantation schemes.

Several Omani start-ups, alongside international companies, are exploring opportunities to produce biofuels and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by cultivating select crops irrigated with treated produced water.

Another promising application involves supporting Oman’s 10-million-tree initiative and furthering carbon credit projects, especially in desert regions where water scarcity limits irrigation efforts. These endeavors align closely with PDO’s sustainability strategy, the Environment Authority’s goals to enhance greening, and Oman’s overall net-zero emissions target.

This initiative highlights PDO’s commitment to sustainable resource management and innovative value creation from by-products of its oil and gas operations, contributing to the country’s environmental and economic objectives.

The levy will apply to tickets sold from 1 April 2026, for flights departing from Singapore on or after 1 October 2026, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced.
Travellers who fly farther will pay more because longer flights consume more fuel, CAAS said.
For flights with multiple stops, the levy will be based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore.
All the funds collected through the imposition of the SAF levy will go into a statutory SAF fund to be managed by CAAS.","Airline passengers departing from Singapore will have to pay a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) levy ranging from S$1 (US$0.77) to S$41.60 per ticket (US$32.04), depending on their travel destination and travel class.

In imposing this levy, Singapore will become the first country in the world to introduce a SAF tax on outbound flights.

The levy will apply to tickets sold from 1 April 2026, for flights departing from Singapore on or after 1 October 2026, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced.

This means that if a ticket is bought before 1 April for a flight departing after 1 October, the levy will not apply. Likewise, if a ticket is bought after 1 April for a flight before 1 October, there will be no levy.

Geographical bands

All destinations from Singapore will be grouped into four geographical bands:

Band 1: Southeast Asia

Band 2: Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia and Papua New Guinea

Band 3: Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific Islands and New Zealand

Band 4: the Americas.

Travellers who fly farther will pay more because longer flights consume more fuel, CAAS said. Passengers in business or first class are set to pay up to four times more than those in economy class, based on industry norms for calculating the carbon emissions of passengers in different cabin classes.

Passengers travelling to Band 1 destinations will pay S$1 (US$0.77) if travelling in an economy cabin, which includes economy class and premium economy, and S$4 (US$3.08) for a premium cabin, which includes business class and first class.

Band 2 passengers will pay S$2.80 (US$2.16) and S$11.20 (US$8.62) for an economy cabin and a premium cabin, respectively.

Band 3 passengers will pay S$6.40 (US$4.93) and S$25.60 (US$19.71), and Band 4 passengers will pay S$10.40 (US$8.01) and S$41.60 (US$32.02) for an economy cabin and a premium cabin respectively.

The levy will not apply to passengers transiting through Singapore. For flights with multiple stops, the levy will be based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore.

The levy will also apply to cargo shipments, and general and business aviation flights – such as private jets and chartered services – departing Singapore.

New entity to procure SAF

The announcement of the levy amounts comes after CAAS said last month that it had set up a new entity to centrally procure sustainable aviation fuel and secure a more affordable and stable supply for Singapore and the region.

Levies collected from passengers will go into a fund used to purchase sustainable aviation fuel. The airline will collect the levy and must display it as a distinct line item on the air ticket sold.

All the funds collected through the imposition of the SAF levy will go into a statutory SAF fund to be managed by CAAS. In turn, the fund will subsequently be used solely for the purchase of SAF and/or SAF environmental attributes, said CAAS, and would cover the associated administrative costs.

One percent target

The levy amounts, said CAAS, were calculated based on the volume of fuel needed to meet Singapore’s one per cent target for 2026, and the projected price of the fuel.

Singapore’s target is for sustainable aviation fuel to form one per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026.

The goal is to raise this target to three per cent to five per cent by 2030, depending on global developments and the availability of the green jet fuel, which is mostly made from waste materials such as used cooking oil.

CAAS said the levy amount will be fixed for as long as the target remains at one per cent. The amount will be relooked only when the current one per cent target is adjusted in future.

The levy will be applied on top of a total of $65.20 (US$50.21) in fees that departing passengers who start their trips at Changi Airport already pay. These fees will go up in stages from April 2027, reaching $79.20 (US$61) in April 2030 – a 21 per cent rise.

Passengers may not pay the whole levy

However, operating airlines may likely swallow some of the impact of the new levy being charged, to ensure that their flights from Singapore remain competitive.

Instead, airlines may well adjust their base fares to keep the overall cost of tickets competitive, thereby absorbing some, if not all, of the levy. It is also worth noting that in the case of frequent flyer award tickets and other complimentary ticket types, the SAF levy will still apply and is likely to be picked up in full by the passenger, as with any other tax or surcharge.",https://ftnnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/singapore-airlines-plane-at-airport-gate.webp,N,,2025-11-16 14:56:13.250221

This enhanced access is designed to directly support Kenya’s ambitious tourism strategy, which seeks to attract 5 million international tourists by 2030.

The new flight schedule is as follows:

Flight Route Departure (DXB/NBO) Arrival (NBO/DXB) EK717 Dubai to Nairobi 00:55 hrs 05:05 hrs EK718 Nairobi to Dubai 06:50 hrs 12:50 hrs

The service will be operated by a three-class Boeing 777 aircraft, providing travellers with access to the airline’s premium product offering, including its renowned First Class cabins.

Crucially, the early morning arrival time has been synchronized with the existing interline agreement signed with Kenya Airways (KQ) in 2023. This optimization enables seamless onward travel for passengers connecting from Dubai to key regional destinations, including:

Rwanda (Kigali)

Kilimanjaro in Tanzania

Mozambique

Burundi (Bujumbura)

Since the partnership’s inception, over 31,000 passengers have already benefited from the cooperation.

The Boeing 777 will add an extra 280 tonnes of weekly capacity to and from Nairobi. This added belly-hold capacity is particularly beneficial for the movement of time and temperature-sensitive perishable commodities, such as fresh flowers, fruits, and vegetables, which are major exports from Kenya. Including the existing three weekly Emirates SkyCargo freighter services, the airline will now offer a combined weekly capacity of over 1,100 tonnes in and out of the Kenyan market.

The expansion comes on the heels of the signing of a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) between Kenya and the UAE earlier this year.",https://hapakenya.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/EA-Emirates-A380-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 17:56:12.125545

It's clear that FedEx is working toward a more sustainable, greener future and is seeking more efficient ways to ship your packages.","As companies continue to introduce green initiatives and reduce their carbon footprint, shipping organizations find themselves in the spotlight, and FedEx is making some positive changes.

According to a sponsored piece in Forbes Asia, FedEx has launched several initiatives across the continent to advance its sustainability ahead of its target of full carbon neutrality by 2040.

FedEx's facilities in Singapore and Incheon, South Korea, both use solar panels that reduce their reliance on fossil fuels from the domestic power grid. They've been pushing for more efficient travel routes, while automation is reducing task redundancy and improving energy efficiency.

For their transpacific flights, FedEx has started using sustainable aviation fuel at Los Angeles International Airport, and SAF currently accounts for 20% of their fuel usage, with plans to expand.

But most important to FedEx's Asian decarbonization plans is the implementation of electric vehicles for ground delivery. Last-mile delivery — the stretch between a processing center and the final destination — is often the most carbon pollution-intensive part of a package's journey.

As such, FedEx has been introducing EVs across Asia — from custom-built vans in Singapore to EVs comprising over 20% of its delivery fleet in China — and has introduced electric tricycles in Taiwan to help navigate dense city streets.

The moves come at a crucial time for the freight and shipping industries. Air freight generates significant harmful carbon pollution, and FedEx is a major part of the problem.

According to a 2024 report by the Guardian, FedEx and UPS accounted for 24.7% of the air freight industry's carbon pollution in 2023, and the industry had seen pollution swell by 25% since 2019.

Lastly, feeding durability lessons into next-generation programs allows GE to position itself as the aircraft engine manufacturer of the future, one that truly builds engines that are made to last.
For airlines, durability is ultimately where engineering meets daily reality.","Multinational aerospace manufacturer and market leader in engine production, GE Aerospace, is currently pouring engineering, testing, and analytics resources into achieving the singular goal of producing some of the most durable engines ever created. The company is also beginning to focus on the development of incredibly durable military-grade engines. In addition, the company is refining the GEnx, LEAP, and GE9X families with upgraded hot-section parts, advanced coatings, ceramic matrix composites, and heavy dust-ingestion campaigns that mimic punishing Middle Eastern and Asian conditions.

Lessons from billions of flight hours are currently being fed straight into aircraft fleets and into the next-generation CFM RISE open-fan demonstrator. The mission is ultimately straightforward but somewhat demanding, as it gives airlines a longer time on the wing, fewer surprises in the shop, and a more reliable foundation for the development of future ultra-efficient aircraft. We analyze these latest developments in detail.

What Are The Key Developments In This Story?

General Electric's durability push starts with a ""test early, test often"" philosophy. The GEnx, which was originally designed as a highly efficient Boeing 787 and Boeing 747-8 engine, has received redesigned high-pressure turbine blades, new combustor coatings, and complementary tools like 360 Foam Wash, all of which more than double engine time-on-wing in harsh operating environments. CFM LEAP engines are also undergoing aggressive dust-ingestion campaigns and controlled turn-on, turn-off test sequences to validate hardware tweaks intended to more than double time on wing for LEAP-1A and improve LEAP-1B performance from 2026.

The General Electric GE9X, which was originally destined for the Boeing 777X, has endured over 30,000 cycles, including more than 9,000 endurance and 1,600 dust-related cycles, making it General Electric's most heavily tested commercial engine. Durability concepts are also being baked into the RISE open-fan demonstrator and key military engines like the F110 and the T700, according to commentary from the manufacturer itself.

What Does GE Get Out Of This Ambitious Project?

For GE Aerospace, building tougher engines is both a defensive move and an overall growth strategy. Airlines have been vocal about durability shortfalls across the industry, with long shop turnaround times and grounded fleets driving up costs and airfares. Lufthansa's Chief Technology Officer has publicly urged manufacturers to prioritize time-on-wing as highly as fuel burn.

By demonstrating tangible gains, such as durability kits for LEAP-1A certified by regulators and aimed at achieving CFM56-like market and program maturity, both GE and CFM can continue to maintain the trust of operators and aircraft manufacturers. Better durability also helps strengthen GE's high-margin services franchise, as engines that stay on wings longer require more sophisticated monitoring, on-site maintenance, and eventually equipment overhauls.

However, the big difference, and what is truly the kicker for operators and aircraft builders, is that these engines come along with significantly fewer disruptive unscheduled events. Lastly, feeding durability lessons into next-generation programs allows GE to position itself as the aircraft engine manufacturer of the future, one that truly builds engines that are made to last.

What Benefits Do These Kinds Of Engines Create For Operators?

For airlines, durability is ultimately where engineering meets daily reality. Engines that cannot withstand dust, heat, and long cycles without coming off-wing translate directly into aircraft with higher availability. At the same time, it lowers spare-engine pools' sizes and decreases the risk of schedule-busting equipment-related events. General Electric cites GEnx hot-section upgrades that have more than doubled time on wing in harsh environments, and similar gains are targeted for LEAP, narrowing the gap with the benchmark CFM56.

This means that more flights per engine, more predictable maintenance slots, and a better ability to plan during peak seasons are all byproducts of having such advanced equipment. Improved durability also complements fuel efficiency and sustainability.

Engines like the GEnX, the LEAP, and the GE9X already cut fuel burn versus older types, and they are being certified for higher blends of sustainable aviation fuel, helping airlines meet emissions targets without sacrificing reliability. For operators burned by recent durability crises, a tougher engine is not just a technical win but rather an operational and financial shock absorber.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_1958680975-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-16 12:56:51.400084

Held once again at Dubai World Central (DWC), the 2025 edition carries the theme ‘The Future is Here,’ bringing together the world’s top minds and companies to map out the next era of aviation, defence and space.

What began decades ago as a regional exhibition has grown into one of the industry’s most influential gatherings. The Dubai Airshow is now where major deals are signed, new technologies are unveiled, and global leaders come together to discuss what’s next for flight. It’s also where the world gets a glimpse of the ideas and innovations that will shape airports, aircraft and air travel in the decades ahead.

This year, the scale is unprecedented. More than 1,500 exhibitors are confirmed, including 440 taking part for the first time. The show expects around 148,000 trade visitors and 490 delegations representing civil and military organisations from 115 countries. The site will feature 21 country pavilions — with Morocco participating for the first time — along with 98 chalets and an extra 8,000 square metres of exhibition space to accommodate growing demand. Start-ups will also have a strong presence, with more than 120 new innovators and 50 investors joining the line-up.

The flying and static displays, a favourite for industry professionals and aviation fans alike, will be the largest ever staged. More than 200 aircraft will be on show, ranging from commercial jets and private planes to advanced military assets, UAVs and next-generation tech. Visitors can expect to see Joby Aviation’s much-talked-about eVTOL aircraft, General Atomics’ CCA, the Bristell B23 915 IFR, and the newly added COMAC C919 and C929 — among many others.

The UAE’s growing role in global space exploration will also be on full display. This year’s Dubai Airshow features the biggest Space Pavilion in the event’s history, organised in partnership with the UAE Space Agency. The pavilion will bring together international space agencies, cutting-edge companies, emerging start-ups, academics and investors for five packed days of discussions, collaboration and demonstrations.

Dr Ahmad Belhoul Al Falasi, Minister of Sports and Chairman of the UAE Space Agency, said the UAE’s progress is now drawing global attention. “Dubai Airshow has become a leading platform to showcase the UAE’s achievements in space,” he said. “The strong participation this year reflects worldwide confidence in our growing capabilities and the future we are building for a sustainable space economy.”

Sustainability is expected to be a defining theme across the event. Exhibitors will highlight the latest steps toward greener aviation — from Sustainable Aviation Fuel and electric-powered ground equipment to cleaner airport operations and energy-efficient technologies.

Dubai Airports CEO Paul Griffiths said this year’s Airshow will include a dedicated Airport and Airline Keynote Track for the first time, bringing together more than 450 global leaders in aviation. One of the major highlights will be a fully sustainable aircraft turnaround, carried out in partnership with dnata, flydubai and other partners — a world-first demonstration designed to show how cleaner operations can work at scale.

Dubai’s ambitions in Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) will take centre stage this year. For the first time, eVTOL aircraft — electric vertical take-off and landing models — will join the flying display. Joby Aviation’s aircraft is expected to be one of the key draws, as the AAM Pavilion gives visitors a closer look at the vehicles and technologies that could redefine urban travel.

Mohammed Abdulla Lengawi, Director General of the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority, said the milestone signals Dubai’s leadership in preparing the regulatory landscape for these emerging technologies. “This marks a new era in urban air mobility,” he said. “We’re ready to show the world what the future of flight looks like.”

The 2025 edition will also deliver its largest conference programme yet, with more than 450 speakers across four stages and 12 dedicated tracks. Themes will span the entire aerospace ecosystem — from maintenance and digital transformation to passenger experience, cybersecurity, airport tech and workforce development.

Major General Mubarak Saeed bin Ghafan Al Jabri, Executive Director of the Military Committee for the Airshow, said the event remains a vital platform for defence cooperation and innovation. Several world-class aerobatic teams will perform throughout the week, showcasing precision, skill and operational capability.

Innovation will be at the heart of the show.

The summit has been doing some good noise across the last two days and in fact was very much quite successful and brought solid results in terms of investments.

The state attracted some of the biggest Indian and global companies in data centres, green energy, hydrogen, aviation, EV materials and even space technology showing that the state is back in business in a big way not just by ease but by the speed of doing business setting a strong foundation. In simple words, The Summit resulted in getting investments worth a massive number of 13.26 Lakhs crores with promises to give 16.31 lakhs jobs in the state.

Leading the pack was Brookfield, the global investment giant, along with its partners EVREN and Axis Energy. Together, they announced up to ₹1 lakh crore, the largest investment commitment of the entire summit. Their plan includes a 3 GW clean-energy-powered hyperscale data centre, large solar and wind projects, battery storage, and green hydrogen/green ammonia production. This single commitment itself makes Andhra Pradesh home to India’s Largest sustainable Data centre that would meet the future needs of the nation in terms of sustainability and green energy.

Reliance Industries followed closely with nearly ₹90,000 crore in combined projects.

In a landmark bid to create value from the massive volumes of produced water generated by its daily oilfield operations, Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) — the Sultanate of Oman’s largest producer of oil and gas — has invited interested companies to register their interest in utilising suitably treated water for agricultural, industrial and other commercial purposes.

Majority state-owned PDO currently generates around 948,600 m³/day of produced water — highly saline, oil-contaminated water that comes to the surface along with crude oil — volumes enough to fill an estimated 380 Olympic-sized swimming pools each day. This figure is projected to rise to 1.4 million m³/day (equivalent to about 560 Olympic-sized pools) by 2030.

To sustainably manage these vast volumes and harness their in-country value potential, PDO is preparing to invite local and international firms to submit techno-commercial proposals for the utilisation of treated volumes from two major treatment plants at Nimr and Rima within its concession. As a first step, however, interested parties must prequalify to participate in the competitive process; the deadline for submissions is December 21, 2025.

The Nimr Wetlands (Nimr Water Treatment Plant), launched in 2010, ranks among the world’s largest constructed wetlands for treating produced water. Its current capacity stands at around 175,000 m³/day. The Rima Water Treatment Plant, meanwhile, can treat up to 65,000 m³/day.

At both plants, produced water is cleaned through a sequence of natural and engineered steps: the oil is first separated, after which the water flows through extensive wetland reed beds where plants and microbes break down remaining impurities. The partially treated water then moves to evaporation ponds, which further concentrate and reduce the volume. In some streams, an additional polishing stage improves water quality. Overall, the system is highly effective, removing the vast majority of oil and producing treated water suitable for a range of beneficial uses.

PDO has recently intensified efforts to explore market solutions to increase the beneficial reuse of this treated water in areas such as agriculture, wetland development, biodiversity enhancement; and other industrial, commercial and mineral-extraction activities.

At Nimr, part of the treated water has been used for irrigating plants such as cotton, Ricinus (castor) and jojoba to produce valuable downstream products or biological oils for further processing. Local tree species such as eucalyptus are also flourishing, raising hopes that farming operations at Nimr can be significantly scaled up in the near future.

In addition, initiatives aimed at creating value through the extraction of salts and minerals have been pursued. Notable examples include the Fahud Salt Making Project, the Qarn Alam Steam Hypersaline Project and the use of surface water for plantation schemes.

A number of Omani start-ups, along with international players, are also exploring opportunities to produce biofuel and even Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) through the cultivation of select crops using treated produced water.

Another promising application is supporting Oman’s 10-million-tree initiative and enabling additional carbon-credit projects, particularly in desert zones where the availability of irrigation water is the main constraint. This aligns not only with PDO’s sustainability strategy but also with the Environment Authority’s greening objectives and Oman’s broader net-zero trajectory.",https://www.omanobserver.om/omanobserver/uploads/images/2025/11/16/thumbs/600x600/3193176.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 11:57:51.262022

Scrutiny Over EU Airlines’ Green Claims

Airlines have never been shy about promoting their green credentials. Browse any carrier’s website and you will see buzzwords about net zero flights, carbon offsets, and sustainable fuels. It all sounds great, and in many cases the intentions are sincere, but the follow through has not always been as solid as the marketing. That gap between the promise and the practice is exactly what brought the European Union to step in and tighten the rules. When it comes to advertising, false claims are a significant concern.

Over the last few years the spotlight on environmental advertising has grown brighter. Travelers are asking tougher questions, regulators want honesty, and climate conferences like COP30 are pushing for real progress rather than polished slogans. That created the perfect moment for the EU to put boundaries around what airlines can say, how they can say it, and what proof they need to show.

What Is Green Washing?

The term “greenwashing” (or “green washing”) is a form of false advertising that overstates the environmental impact of eco-friendly green products, clean energy efforts, or fossil fuel offsets. Companies that engage in greenwashing make misleading claims about the effect of its sustainable practices. Fast fashion brands have been called out for greenwashing as the efforts of using more environmentally-friendly products or processes mislead consumers that their efforts reduce the negative impact of the brand in a meaningful way. In fact, the minor offset is unlikely to address the greater concern of a growing pile of deteriorating clothing discarded into poorer countries or the ocean for disposal.

Brands looking to avoid greenwashing can combat unsubstantiated claims by demonstrating a thorough and robust process to its proposed remedies.

What Triggered the EU Crackdown

Back in June 2023 the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) raised a red flag, calling out 17 European airlines for what it described as misleading environmental claims. That prompted the European Commission and the Consumer Protection Cooperation Network to launch a formal investigation in 2024. After months of review, the result was a coordinated push directed at 21 airlines to clean up their language.

Those airlines have now agreed that they will not imply that emissions from a single flight can vanish just because a traveler buys carbon offsets or because the airline uses a small amount of alternative fuel. If a carrier promotes sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, it now must back the term with real data. The same goes for future environmental targets. Airlines must give timelines, outline which emissions they plan to address, and offer calculations that any traveler can understand without a chemistry degree.

Why This Matters for Travelers

For passengers, this is more than a technical rule change. It reshapes how airlines present themselves and how travelers decide which carriers they believe are actually moving the needle. The EU wants to eliminate vague green marketing and replace it with facts. Transparency matters.

National regulators across Europe will monitor compliance. If promises turn out to be more wishful than real, the possibility of enforcement is on the table. For anyone planning their next trip and wanting cleaner travel options, accurate information helps avoid being misled by a glossy sustainability banner that does not hold up.

Across the Channel, the UK has taken a similar stance. The Advertising Standards Authority has ruled against carriers like Air France, Etihad, Virgin Atlantic, and Lufthansa for environmental claims that lacked required evidence. The ASA has made it clear that net zero messaging in aviation is a priority for its oversight, so this is a trend that reaches far beyond the EU.

What It Means for the Future of Sustainable Flying

This push is not meant to slow down the industry’s progress. It is designed to keep airlines honest and make sure the marketing matches the science. Airlines that invest in sustainable aviation fuel, new technology, and real emission reductions will still have plenty to talk about. The difference is that claims must be grounded in evidence rather than ambition.

For travelers, the benefit is a clearer picture of what sustainable flying really looks like. When an airline says it is cutting emissions, investing in better fuels, or working toward climate goals, the hope is that the path is spelled out rather than wrapped in vague language. Honest information helps people choose flights that align with their values, and it encourages the industry to back its promises with action.

Conclusion

The EU’s move to rein in green claims is a sign of where aviation is headed. As pressure builds for real climate progress, airlines will need to show how their environmental plans work rather than simply hint at them. That shift benefits everyone. Travelers get clarity, regulators get accountability, and airlines are encouraged to turn their sustainability messaging into quantitative results.",https://liveandletsfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/KLM-Boeing-777-at-gate-in-Amsterdam.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 10:56:09.433160

United Airlines’ Plans for 2025 United enters 2025 in one of its most dynamic phases of growth.
Bottom Line Scott Kirby’s pay as United Airlines’ CEO reflects the vast responsibility of steering one of the world’s largest and most complex aviation networks.","United Airlines (UA) stands as one of America’s most recognisable carriers and a founding member of the Star Alliance network. Headquartered in Chicago, it operates a fleet of more than 950 aircraft and serves over 350 destinations worldwide. Alongside Delta and American, it forms one of the three major US airline groups dominating long-haul and domestic travel markets.

Over the past few years, United has rebuilt from the turbulence of the pandemic and record fuel costs, while investing heavily in fleet renewal and technology. The airline’s “United Next” strategy has marked one of the most ambitious expansion plans in the company’s history.

Behind that transformation stands Scott Kirby, United’s chief executive officer, whose leadership has brought a sharp focus on operational efficiency, sustainability, and disciplined growth. Here is a closer look at who Scott Kirby is, what his background brings to the airline, and how his pay package is structured for 2025.

Who is United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby?

Scott Kirby is widely recognised as one of the most analytically minded executives in global aviation. Born in 1967 in Texas, he graduated from the United States Air Force Academy with a degree in Computer Science and Operations Research, before earning a master’s in Operations Research from George Washington University.

After completing his military service, Kirby joined the commercial airline industry during a period of rapid deregulation and restructuring. He began at the now-defunct America West Airlines in 1995, working on scheduling and network strategy. His data-driven decision-making quickly stood out, and he rose to become Executive Vice President of Strategy and Planning.

When America West merged with US Airways, Kirby played a key role in integrating the networks and aligning corporate structures. His reputation for analytical rigour followed him through to US Airways and later to American Airlines, where he served as President after the merger between the two.

In 2016, Kirby made the pivotal move to United Airlines as President and, four years later, succeeded Oscar Munoz as Chief Executive Officer.

Under his leadership, United has pushed for reliability improvements, operational discipline, and one of the largest aircraft orders in history. Kirby’s philosophy places employees and passengers at the core of the airline’s success. He is known for walking the terminals, speaking directly with ground crews, and demanding consistent performance standards.

Despite a reputation for being tough and detail-obsessed, Kirby’s approach has modernised United’s culture, making it a profitable as well as popular choice.

United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby Salary

United Airlines’ executive pay structure is performance-based and heavily tied to shareholder return, profitability, and long-term growth.

In 2024-25, Scott Kirby’s total compensation stood at approximately $33.9 million, representing a significant rise from the previous fiscal year.

Here is a detailed breakdown of his compensation:

Base salary: around $1 million

Short-term bonus and incentives: roughly $8.5 million (based on annual performance metrics)

Stock awards and equity grants: approximately $24.4 million, including a retention award of nearly $10 million

Other benefits and pension contributions: close to $0.5 million

This brings his total estimated compensation for 2025 to around $33.9 million, positioning him among the highest-paid airline executives globally.

However, as with most large aviation groups, only a fraction of this figure represents guaranteed income. The majority depends on United’s operational and financial performance.

If profitability targets or safety metrics are not achieved, a portion of the bonuses and equity awards can be reduced or forfeited entirely.

Kirby’s remuneration package reflects the scale of leading one of the world’s largest network airlines and the complex, highly competitive environment in which United operates.

Peer Comparison

Among his peers, Scott Kirby sits at the top end of the pay scale.

Robert Isom, CEO of American Airlines, earned around $13 million in 2024, though his total target package can exceed that in strong performance years.

Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Air Lines, reported total compensation of about $27 million, largely in equity-based awards.

Bob Jordan, CEO of Southwest Airlines, earned approximately $6.7 million, reflecting Southwest’s different business model and lower executive-pay scale.

Kirby’s higher pay reflects United’s global size, fleet modernisation programme, and ambitious expansion plan. It also includes the retention component designed to keep him in place through the next growth phase, as United executes the largest fleet renewal project in its history.

While critics may point to the size of the package, United’s board has emphasised that his compensation is performance-linked and benchmarked against other Fortune 500 leaders rather than just airline CEOs.

United Airlines’ Plans for 2025

United enters 2025 in one of its most dynamic phases of growth. The airline continues to expand its “United Next” program, a plan that includes more than 700 new aircraft deliveries by the end of the decade.

For 2025, the company expects a capacity increase of roughly 6%, with several new international routes launching from hubs in Chicago, Newark, and Houston. United also plans to introduce new cabin interiors with seatback screens and enhanced Wi-Fi across all mainline aircraft.

Sustainability remains a major focus. United is investing in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and carbon-capture technologies, positioning itself as one of the industry leaders in environmental responsibility.

Operationally, the airline aims to improve on-time performance and reduce cancellations through upgraded crew-management systems and predictive maintenance tools.

Kirby has made it clear that consistency and reliability will define United’s success as much as network growth or fleet size.

Bottom Line

Scott Kirby’s pay as United Airlines’ CEO reflects the vast responsibility of steering one of the world’s largest and most complex aviation networks. His compensation is highly performance-driven and mirrors the company’s results-based culture.

At around $34 million, his 2025 package places him among the top tier of airline executives, though the majority of it is dependent on stock and long-term performance targets.

Kirby’s leadership combines analytical discipline with operational insight, and his compensation system is designed to reward sustainable, measurable results rather than mere tenure. For United, his success, and by extension, his pay, is tied directly to the airline’s continued progress, reliability, and profitability.

At Committee Stage, the House debates whether each clause should be included in the Bill and considers potential amendments to its provisions.
Our recent blogpost looks in more detail at the procedure for Committee Stage in the House of Lords.
At this pace, the prospect of Committee Stage finishing in four days looks increasingly unlikely.","Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction Bill (Committee, Report and Third Reading): This Bill will enable the UK to implement the Agreement on Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction, commonly known as the BBNJ Agreement or High Seas Treaty, which the UK signed in September 2023. The Agreement seeks to strengthen the conservation of areas of the ocean that lie beyond national jurisdiction. (House of Commons Library briefing)

As the UK is what is known as a “dualist state”, international agreements (treaties) do not automatically have legal effect in domestic law. Implementing legislation must therefore be enacted to give internal legal effect to the UK’s obligations. An agreement is internationally binding in principle on signing, but typically provides that it will not come into operation until signatories ratify their consent. By convention, the Government does not ratify an agreement until any necessary domestic legislation has been passed.

The only non-Government amendments on the amendment paper are from the Conservative Shadow Minister, Andrew Rosindell MP. His amendments would require the Secretary of State to review the powers granted to Ministers, to report on the Bill’s implementation, and to require changes to fees charged under the Bill to be approved by both Houses of Parliament.

Under the terms of the programme order agreed at Second Reading, the Committee Stage debate will conclude no later than three hours after it begins, though it may finish earlier. When the debate ends, the House will vote on any Government amendments, along with any other amendments selected by the Chair for separate decision, which will most likely include some of the Conservative proposals.

When a Committee of the Whole House examines a Bill and makes no amendments, there no Report Stage takes place; the House proceeds directly to Third Reading. In this case, however, the Government has tabled three drafting amendments, so a formal Report Stage may be required. MPs are able to table amendments at Committee Stage, so MPs are unlikely to table any amendments for Report Stage. Therefore, Report Stage will likely take place without debate.

In accordance with the programme order, the Third Reading debate will come to an end no later than four hours after the start of the Committee Stage debate (or one hour after the likely end time of Committee Stage). Divisions on amendments often take up most – if not all – of the remaining time, so Third Reading debates are typically very short.

Statutory Instruments that require the approval of the House of Commons are automatically referred for debate to a Delegated Legislation Committee (DLC), however there is no automatic referral of Measures – a special form of legislation made by the General Synod that is subject to approval by the Commons and Lords before having the force of an Act of Parliament. So Ministers conventionally put forward motions to allow Measures to be debated in Committee.

18:00: MPs will debate e-petition 713714, which calls on the Government to increase funding for people with Parkinson’s and to implement the ‘Parky Charter’. The petition has around 113,000 signatures. It was initiated by the presenters of the ‘Movers and Shakers’ podcast, including former journalists Mark Mardell, Jeremy Paxman and Rory Cellan-Jones, all of whom have been diagnosed with Parkinson’s. (House of Commons Library briefing)

Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill (Third Reading): At Third Reading, Peers decide whether to approve the Bill. Unlike the Commons, the Lords can still make amendments at Third Reading, but only for the purposes of clarifying uncertainties, improving the drafting, or fulfilling undertakings made by the Government at earlier stages. No such amendments have so far been tabled.

Because Peers have amended the Bill during its passage, it will return to the House of Commons for MPs to consider the Lords’ changes. ‘Ping-pong’ between the two Houses will then occur, so that both Houses can agree on the same text.

The Government suffered only one defeat during the Bill’s passage through the House of Lords. That defeat was on an amendment from the Conservative Peer Lord Jackson of Peterborough, which requires the Government to collate and publish data on the number of overseas students who have had their visas revoked or have been deported as a result of criminal offences, and for that data to be broken down by nationality. The Government is likely to reverse or otherwise alter this amendment when the Bill returns to the Commons.

Where the Commons has proposed an alternative amendment, or has disagreed with a Lords alternative amendment, the Lords will have to decide whether to insist on its amendment, accept the Commons’ position, or propose yet another alternative amendment. Unless the Lords accepts the Commons’ position on all five issues, ping-pong between the two Houses will continue.

Ten Minute Rule Motion: Labour MP Sonia Kumar will seek to introduce an Access to Finance for Women in Business Bill under the Ten Minute Rule which allows MPs to give a ten-minute speech in favour of a Bill before seeking the House’s permission to introduce it. The Bill would require the Government to publish a report and relevant data. See our Hansard Society guide for more information about the parliamentary procedure for Ten Minute Rule Bills.

The background to this Bill is the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023, often referred to as the Legacy Act. That legislation – enacted under the previous Government – set up the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (“the ICRIR”) to investigate Troubles-related deaths and serious injuries. It would also have ended criminal investigations, inquests and civil claims related to the Troubles that had not reached an advanced stage by a certain date.

Court rulings since the passage of the Act have declared several of its provisions to be incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), including the proposal to end criminal and civil proceedings in relation to the Troubles, which was found to be incompatible and was disapplied by virtue of the Windsor Framework, meaning that part of the Act ceased to be law.

The Bill has been presented to Parliament in tandem with another legislative vehicle – a Remedial Order – to implement a new regime for handling issues relating to the legacy of the Troubles. Under the 1998 Human Rights Act, where a court declares that a legislative provision is incompatible with the ECHR, the Government may make a Remedial Order, a form of Statutory Instrument, to amend the legislation and bring it into compliance with the ECHR. Remedial Orders are subject to a bespoke parliamentary procedure. First, a proposal for a Remedial Order is laid before Parliament for 60 days. After this initial scrutiny period, the final draft Remedial Order is laid. The draft Remedial Order is then subject to a further 60 days of scrutiny, during which it is considered by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. A draft Remedial Order relating to the Legacy Act was laid before the House on the same day the Bill was presented, following a 60-day scrutiny period of the earlier proposal.

The Government’s approach is to use the Remedial Order to repeal any provisions that it does not intend to replace, while using the Bill to replace or restate text from the previous Act. In particular, the Remedial Order would remove all Legacy Act provisions relating to immunity from prosecution and would enable all civil proceedings previously prohibited by the Legacy Act – including future cases – to proceed. In contrast, the Bill would:

At Second Reading, the House will debate the general principles underlying the Bill. No amendments to the text can be made at this stage. Once the Bill has received its Second Reading, the programme motion tabled by the Government provides that it will be committed to a Committee of the Whole House for detailed clause-by-clause scrutiny at the next stage, with the remaining stages of the Bill taking place across two days.

Diego Garcia Military Base and British Indian Ocean Territory Bill (Committee, day 1): This Bill gives legislative effect to the UK–Mauritius Treaty on the Chagos Archipelago. In accordance with the treaty, the Bill terminates UK sovereignty over the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) and amends legislation to reflect that the BIOT will cease to exist as an overseas territory. By convention, the Government does not ratify a treaty until the necessary implementing legislation – like this Bill – has been passed by Parliament.

This is the first of two days currently scheduled for the Bill’s Committee Stage, which will take place in the House of Lords Chamber. A second sitting is scheduled for Tuesday 25 November. At Committee Stage, the House debates whether each clause should be included in the Bill and considers potential amendments to its provisions.

The clauses and amendments are debated in the order in which they appear, or would appear, in the Bill. Therefore, the first clauses and amendments to be debated will be the earliest clauses of the Bill and the amendments that relate to them. The first two clauses relate to the commencement of the Act and the withdrawal of British sovereignty over the Chagos Islands. (House of Lords Library briefing)

Ten Minute Rule Motion: Labour MP Peter Swallow will seek to introduce a Driving Without Insurance (Penalties and Enforcement) Bill under the Ten Minute Rule which allows MPs to give a ten-minute speech in favour of a Bill before seeking the House’s permission to introduce it. The Bill would make provision about the penalties for driving without insurance and require the Secretary of State to prepare and publish a report containing an assessment of the effectiveness of existing methods of enforcing the law.

As outlined above, the only defeat the Government suffered in the Lords was on an amendment to require the Government to collate and publish data on the number of overseas students who have had their visas revoked or have been deported as a result of criminal offences, and for that data to be broken down by nationality.

The House of Commons must decide whether to agree with the Lords’ amendment, disagree with it outright, or propose an alternative. If the House disagrees with it outright or proposes an alternative, the Bill will return to the House of Lords, which will then need to decide how to respond.

At Committee Stage, MPs consider whether each clause should stand part of the Bill and whether any amendments should be made. Under the terms of the programme order agreed at Second Reading, the debate on Committee Stage will end no later than two hours after it begins, though it may end earlier, and the shortness of the Second Reading debate may indicate that it is likely to end earlier. At the end of the debate the House will vote on any Government amendments and any amendments selected by the Chair for separate decision.

Where the House has scrutinised a Bill in Committee of the Whole House and not made any amendments to it, no Report Stage takes place. Therefore, if no amendments are made, the House will move straight on to Third Reading. So far, no amendments – either from the Government or from non-Government MPs – have been tabled.

In accordance with the programme order, the Third Reading debate will come to an end no later than three hours after the start of the Committee Stage debate (or one hour after the likely end time of Committee Stage). Third Reading debates in the House of Commons are typically very short.

Oral questions: At 15:00, Peers will begin the day by questioning Ministers for 40 minutes, on discussions with the United States about Ukraine; serious injuries and deaths on the roads; and the hydrogen and fuel cell industry. The topic of a fourth question will be decided by a ballot drawn at lunchtime on Monday 17 November.

General debate: International Men’s Day: This debate was scheduled by the Backbench Business Committee at the request of Labour MP Josh Newbury. This will be the tenth year in a row that this day has been marked with a debate in the Chamber (International Men’s Day falls on the 19 November). In his application to the Committee, Mr Newbury explained that it would be an opportunity for a wide-ranging debate on “the positive contribution of men and boys to their families, communities and workplaces and to society at large”, including subjects such as health conditions, suicide rates, addiction, unemployment, education and flexible working, violence against women and girls, crime and the criminal justice system. (House of Commons Library research briefing)

General debate: Injury in service award: This debate was also scheduled by the Backbench Business Committee, at the request of the Liberal Democrat MP Tom Morrison. In his application to the Committee he explained that the proposed award is inspired by the experience of his constituent, Jane Notley, whose career as a police officer ended when she had to retire after she was injured in the line of duty, and by former police officer Tom Curry, who has been campaigning publicly for recognition of officers injured on duty. Mr Morrison tabled an Early Day Motion supporting a new Injury on Duty Award scheme in February 2025 which has now been signed by 110 members.

Oral questions: At 11:00, Peers will begin the day by questioning Ministers for 40 minutes, on water and sewerage companies as consultees on nationally significant infrastructure projects; South Western Railway’s performance since nationalisation; and compensation awards to victim of child grooming scandals. The topic of a fourth question will be decided by a ballot drawn at lunchtime on Tuesday 18 November.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill (Second Reading): This Bill completed all its stages in the House of Commons last month and now begins its scrutiny in the Lords. The purpose of this legislation is to ensure stability in the pricing of non-petroleum aviation fuel, with price guarantees funded through a levy on aviation fuel suppliers. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is deemed one of the most effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation sector. However, SAF supplies are uncertain, so the Bill is designed to support investment in UK production facilities. The Bill has cross-party support and only a few amendments, of a technical nature, were made to it by the Government during its passage in the House of Commons. (House of Lords Library briefing)

At Second Reading, the House of Lords debates the principles and purposes of the Bill but cannot make amendments to the Bill’s text. If Second Reading is agreed, the Bill will be committed to Grand Committee for clause-by-clause examination.

Statutory Instrument debate: The House will debate a motion to approve the draft Radio Equipment (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2025, which implements a 2022 EU regulation in Northern Ireland. The 2022 regulation applies additional essential requirements to certain categories of radio equipment that manufacturers must meet, before placing such equipment on the EU market. Under the terms of the Windsor Framework, the EU regulation must apply in Northern Ireland.

The non-affiliated peer Baroness Hoey has tabled a regret motion – a type of motion which allows the House to express concerns about a Statutory Instrument without blocking it – which states that the Regulations will “give effect to legislation made by the European Commission, without public consultation and without taking account of the needs of small businesses in Northern Ireland.”

Grand Committee: Questions for short debate: There will be four questions for short debate (QSD), which are general debates that come in the form of a question to a Minister. QSDs are drawn from a ballot every five sitting weeks. The first four entries drawn from the ballot are debated in Grand Committee on a Thursday, with the other entries appearing on a supplementary list in the order they were drawn. Questions on the supplementary list can be taken in the Chamber as short debates between items of business, either in the lunch break, dinner break, or as the last business of the day. Today’s topics are the first four entries that were drawn in the ballot on Wednesday 5 November, and each is time-limited to one hour.

10:00: Public Accounts Committee – Costs of clinical negligence: Samantha Jones, the Permanent Secretary at the Department for Health and Social Care, and other senior officials from NHS England and NHS Resolution will give evidence. This inquiry follows up the publication last month of a National Audit Office report on clinical negligence costs. The Committee has indicated that topics for discussion with officials will include what steps are being taken “to reduce patient harm and improve patient safety across the NHS, and the effective management of costs, including the reduction of legal fees”.

Animal Welfare (Import of Dogs, Cats and Ferrets) Bill (Third Reading): This Bill, which has been passed by the Commons and had no amendments tabled in the Lords, is set to have its final stage prior to becoming law. (House of Lords Library briefing)

At Committee Stage, the House must decide whether each clause and schedule should be included in the Bill, and whether any amendments should be made or new clauses and schedules added. At the time of writing, around 985 amendments have been tabled to the Bill, of which only two have actually been decided or withdrawn during the debate. Related amendments are grouped together for debate, at the suggestion of the Government Whips, to facilitate a more coherent, focused discussion and to avoid repetition. Our recent blogpost looks in more detail at the procedure for Committee Stage in the House of Lords.

The next groups of amendments to be debated relate to coercion, pressure and financial abuse; the age of eligibility for assisted dying; drafting changes; and the requirement for eligible persons to be resident in England or Wales and registered with a medical practice in England or Wales.

In advance of the first sitting last Friday, the Government Whips published the first 20 groups of amendments, covering 219 of the amendments. Lord Falconer of Thoroton – the Bill’s sponsor – set a target for the House to get through ten groups at the first sitting.

In the event, progress through amendments during that first sitting was slow: only two of the ten groups were debated, covering just seven of the hundreds of amendments tabled thus far. At this pace, the prospect of Committee Stage finishing in four days looks increasingly unlikely.

“the Government remain neutral and will not be providing Government time for this Bill. Obviously, we will look at things when we get to the end of our four days in Committee. I will then work with the Usual Channels to see what other time can be made available from non-Government time, but we will have to see whether we will move on over the next few days.”

However, he later struck a more equivocal tone, saying that “the Government do not have any Government time to give it at the moment”.",,N,,2025-11-16 10:56:26.094753

While sales were largely flat, the company posted positive net income after last year's losses.

Calumet’s recent pivot to profitability and rising production have drawn new investor interest, reflected in its share price rallying 41% over the past 90 days. While momentum is building in the short term, the one-year total shareholder return remains down 11%, indicating there is still ground to recover for long-term holders.

If growing momentum like this has you searching for dynamic opportunities, now is the perfect moment to broaden your search and uncover

With shares still trading at a discount to analyst targets despite recent gains, the key question for investors is whether Calumet’s turnaround leaves room for more upside or if the market has already factored in future growth.

Most Popular Narrative: 7.8% Undervalued

Calumet’s fair value estimate from the most widely followed narrative comes in higher than the last close, suggesting there may still be room for upside. The fair value is set at $20.25, while shares finished the latest session at $18.67. This sets the stage for significant drivers under the surface that could impact future returns.

The MaxSAF 150 project is on track to start up in the first half of 2026, enabling Calumet to produce 120-150 million annual gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at relatively low capital costs. The project is expected to capture premiums of $1-$2/gallon over renewable diesel and tap into surging mandated and voluntary SAF demand globally. This is likely to drive a material step-up in revenues and EBITDA margin expansion once operational.

Curious how Calumet’s big value call is built? The future fair value rides on ambitious profit leaps and a profit multiple that will raise eyebrows. Want to know what bold forecasts make the math work? The blueprint is hiding beyond the headline numbers. Discover what’s fueling the narrative’s ambitious target.

Result: Fair Value of $20.25 (UNDERVALUED)

However, future gains could stall if regulatory tailwinds fade or if Calumet’s heavy debt limits its ability to invest and weather downturns.

Another View: What Do the Numbers Say?

While the fair value narrative points to Calumet being undervalued, the price-to-sales ratio offers a more nuanced perspective. Calumet trades at 0.4x sales, which is twice its peer average of 0.2x, but still well below the U.S. Oil and Gas industry norm of 1.6x. Notably, the fair ratio for Calumet is 0.6x, suggesting the current price is below where the market could move. Does this gap highlight a hidden opportunity, or signal that investors are ignoring real risks?

The world is on the move—literally. Air travel connects continents, fuels global commerce, and brings people closer together than ever before. Yet, with international air passenger numbers projected to nearly double over the next two decades, aviation faces one of the most exciting and urgent challenges in its history: how to grow sustainably while drastically cutting carbon emissions. The industry’s bold goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 is not just ambitious—it’s revolutionary.

The stakes could not be higher. As passenger numbers soar, fuel consumption may climb to an astounding 370 million gallons per day. Without decisive action, aviation-related emissions could rise by 40% by 2040. This forecast underscores the need for immediate innovation and global collaboration. But the good news is that the aviation industry is already charting a course toward a cleaner, greener future. From industry leaders to policymakers and engineers, a shared commitment to decarbonization is energizing the skies.

Aviation and the Race Against Climate Change: Charting a New Flight Path to Net Zero

Aviation has always symbolized human progress, connecting people and economies across the globe. Yet, the very industry that unites us is now facing a turbulent challenge—its growing contribution to climate change. From the steady plume of carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions to the fleeting but potent influence of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), the aviation sector stands at the intersection of innovation, sustainability, and urgency. The need for decisive action has never been more apparent, nor more exciting.

In 2022, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) made a bold commitment: achieving net-zero CO₂ emissions by 2050. This target echoes the global ambition set out in the Paris Agreement—to limit warming well below 2°C, while striving to stay within the 1.5°C threshold. However, current trends indicate that aviation is not on track to meet that goal. Fuel efficiency improvements are progressing, but not fast enough. Sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs), hailed as a game-changer, are still produced in limited quantities. And while electric and hydrogen-powered aircraft spark enthusiasm, they remain primarily in development stages. The message is clear: ambition must now transform into acceleration.

But there’s a silver lining piercing through this complex cloud layer. Scientists are deepening our understanding of non-CO₂ climate effects from aviation, particularly the role of SLCPs such as nitrogen oxides, black carbon, and the mesmerizing but problematic contrail cirrus—those white streaks across the sky that can trap heat in the atmosphere. Recent research suggests that controlling these short-lived pollutants could bring relatively rapid climate benefits. For instance, contrail mitigation strategies—altering flight paths, adjusting altitudes, or developing cleaner combustion technologies—could cool the planet in the short term while longer-term CO₂ reduction technologies mature.

Despite this promising outlook, current aviation decarbonization roadmaps do not yet fully incorporate SLCP controls. This gap represents not a failure, but an opportunity. Integrating SLCP management into aviation’s net-zero strategy could significantly accelerate climate progress, providing a bridge between today’s emissions reality and tomorrow’s cleaner skies.

To put the challenge into perspective, the world’s remaining “warming budget” to stay within 1.7°C is shrinking rapidly. Studies warn that global temperatures may exceed 1.5°C before 2030—an alarm bell for every sector, including aviation. If the industry continues its current trajectory without deep innovation and coordinated global policy, its share of the climate burden will only grow. Yet, the aviation community has something powerful on its side: ingenuity. From the Wright brothers’ first flight to the jet age, aviation has proven that bold vision, science, and determination can transform the impossible into the achievable.

Reimagining aviation for a net-zero future is not just an environmental responsibility—it is a call to action for engineers, policymakers, and travellers alike. Every new aircraft design, every liter of sustainable fuel, and every rerouted contrail brings us closer to a future where the skies remain open, blue, and climate safe. The task is immense, but the opportunity is exhilarating. Aviation’s next great leap will not only be across continents—it will be toward a stable and sustainable planet.

Propelling Aerospace Toward a Cleaner Tomorrow: The Bold Journey to Net-Zero Flight!

The quest to decarbonize the aerospace industry is one of the most ambitious and inspiring challenges of our time. While other sectors have made rapid progress toward net-zero goals, aviation stands apart—flying high, quite literally, on the wings of immense technical complexity, safety imperatives, and energy demands. Yet, these challenges make the journey toward sustainable aviation all the more thrilling. The industry’s goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 isn’t just an aspiration—it’s a moonshot that embodies human ingenuity, persistence, and the relentless spirit of innovation.

Aviation is inherently energy-intensive. Flying an aircraft at 35,000 feet and speeds surpassing 600 miles per hour requires an energy-to-weight ratio that very few materials or fuels can offer. Today, fossil-based jet fuel remains the only energy source capable of meeting these extreme performance demands at a competitive cost. Unfortunately, this dependence comes at a significant environmental price. Burning jet fuel emits vast amounts of carbon dioxide and other pollutants, contributing to global climate change. The world urgently needs an alternative, but replacing jet fuel is no simple task.

Achieving Net-Zero: The Trillion-Dollar Journey to Transform Aviation

Reaching net-zero emissions by mid-century is not just a matter of ambition—it’s the defining challenge and opportunity of our generation. The aviation industry sits at the heart of this transformation, a sector that connects the world yet relies heavily on fossil fuels. To achieve true sustainability, industry leaders, governments, and innovators must come together to invest over a trillion dollars in the next two decades. This monumental commitment will fuel the evolution of new technologies, reshape business models, and redefine what flight means in a greener future.

At the center of this transition lies Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which currently accounts for only 0.3% of global jet fuel use. That statistic alone emphasizes the uphill battle ahead. To close the gap between aspiration and reality, SAF production must scale exponentially. This won’t happen naturally or easily; it will require a symphony of global cooperation, with governments implementing forward-looking regulations, creating economic incentives, and ensuring that early adopters of sustainable solutions are not left at a disadvantage. Industry stakeholders must also innovate relentlessly, improving feedstock efficiency, building scalable supply chains, and driving down costs through technology and volume. The success of SAF will be measured not only in gallons produced but in the industry’s ability to make it a mainstream, economically viable alternative to conventional jet fuel.

Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) have emerged as a promising bridge toward a cleaner aviation future. These fuels can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 70–80% compared to conventional jet fuel—a significant step in the right direction. However, the road to scalable adoption is steep. High production costs, limited access to feedstock, and constrained production capacities have slowed the ramp-up of SAF usage. Even though global SAF production is expected to triple to about 1.9 billion liters in 2024, this figure represents a mere 0.53% of total aviation fuel demand. Clearly, the sector has a long way to go before SAFs can make a substantial dent in emissions figures.

Beyond fuels, the frontier of aircraft and propulsion technology is equally exciting—yet similarly challenging. Hydrogen, electric, and hybrid-electric propulsion systems represent a bold vision for aviation’s future, but these innovations remain in the early stages of development. While breakthroughs are on the horizon, they haven’t yet matured to the point of large-scale deployment. In the near term, the industry will rely on incremental gains within conventional aircraft architectures, continuing the legacy of efficiency improvements that have defined aviation progress for the past 6 decades. Remarkably, every central new aircraft platform since the dawn of the jet age has improved fuel efficiency by about 15%. With ongoing research in aerodynamics, lightweight materials, and engine thermodynamics, there is confidence that the next-generation aircraft—likely entering service around 2034—can achieve similar gains.

However, the intricacies of the industry’s economics add layers of complexity. The typical aircraft development timeline spans eight to ten years, with several more years required to reach peak production. Moreover, the business model for aircraft and propulsion systems relies heavily on long-term aftermarket revenue—often peaking 10 to 15 years after a plane enters service. This means that even if a revolutionary new aircraft were introduced today, its actual market impact would stretch well into the 2040s. In this context, the idea of completely replacing fleets with zero-emission technologies by 2050 becomes practically impossible unless the industry accelerates its readiness for scaled transition technologies right now.

Despite these challenges, the tone of the future is remarkably optimistic. The pathway to net-zero is not one of despair—it’s one of discovery. Industry-wide collaboration, bold investments, and supportive public policy will drive technological evolution at an unprecedented pace. Every dollar invested today in clean energy research, SAF production, and next-generation propulsion moves us closer to an aviation system that connects humanity sustainably.

Re-Capturing Carbon: Paving the Path to Aviation’s Sustainable Future

The aviation industry stands at a thrilling crossroads—where innovation meets responsibility, and ambition embraces environmental stewardship. As airlines continue their journey toward a sustainable sky, the bold challenge that lies ahead is clear: to recapture all the carbon dioxide that cannot yet be avoided. This mission is not simply about offsetting emissions; it is about transforming the very foundation of how we fly.

In the near to mid-term, aircraft will inevitably continue to rely on conventional fossil-based aviation fuels. Despite rapid progress in developing sustainable alternatives, the global fleet cannot transition overnight. Many promising replacements—such as sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) derived from waste materials or synthetic sources—have the potential to reduce net emissions during flight significantly. However, even these advanced fuels are not entirely free of carbon impact; their manufacture and transport still leave a trace of CO₂ behind. Therefore, to truly achieve climate neutrality, the sector must invest vigorously in atmospheric carbon capture technologies and robust, verifiable carbon offset mechanisms.

This is where the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) Net Zero Roadmaps come into play. These five detailed and dynamic roadmaps outline a path toward net-zero emissions by 2050—a monumental goal that demands collaboration among scientists, engineers, policymakers, financiers, and operators worldwide. They represent more than a plan; they are a vision for an aviation ecosystem where every technological advancement, infrastructural investment, operational improvement, and financial model contributes coherently to a sustainable outcome.

What makes these roadmaps particularly inspiring is their adaptability. They acknowledge that the industry’s trajectory will evolve as research deepens and discoveries emerge. Progress in aircraft design, cleaner energy production, optimized flight operations, and supportive government policies will create a symphony of innovation that reshapes our understanding of flight. The journey to sustainable aviation is not linear—it’s an evolving exploration guided by creativity, determination, and global cooperation.

Re-capturing unavoidable carbon is both a technological challenge and a moral imperative. It calls upon the brightest minds to develop scalable carbon removal methods, from direct air capture facilities to nature-based restoration projects. The excitement lies in the possibility: a world where flying no longer contributes to climate change, but instead participates in a balanced, restorative cycle of energy and environment.

The Aircraft Technology Roadmap by IATA stands as a bold, visionary blueprint guiding the aviation industry toward a brilliantly sustainable future —one where technological innovation takes flight toward net-zero emissions! At its core, this roadmap addresses one of the most pressing challenges in aviation—fuel burn and its carbon footprint—by defining how cutting-edge aircraft and engine technologies can achieve revolutionary leaps in energy efficiency. Imagine jet-fuelled aircraft that are 15–20% more efficient than today’s best designs, saving up to 140 million tonnes of CO₂ by 2050 and slashing the sector’s in-flight energy needs by nearly a tenth! These next-generation aircraft will be designed to seamlessly operate on 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), marking a monumental stride in decarbonizing air travel. But the transformation does not stop there—visionary breakthroughs in hydrogen propulsion and electric aircraft promise to propel the industry into an age of zero-emission flight, potentially avoiding an additional 35–125 million tonnes of CO₂, depending on how rapidly these game-changing technologies conquer the skies. Supported by substantial investments and ongoing demonstrator programs in areas such as advanced aerodynamics, aircraft structures, propulsion systems, and intelligent flight controls, each advancement will progress through the TRL scale —from experimental trials to exhilarating first flights and finally to commercial service.

Meanwhile, the Energy and New Fuels Infrastructure Roadmap is laying the groundwork for a massive expansion in SAF production, calling for thousands of new biorefineries and a vast hydrogen network that could redefine global energy flows. By 2050, SAF is expected to account for nearly 90% of aviation fuel, reducing emissions by an astounding 62%, while carbon capture facilities extract over 700 million tonnes of CO₂ from the atmosphere, closing the loop. All of this will be powered by abundant, renewable energy sources, transforming not just aircraft, but the entire aviation ecosystem into a cleaner, smarter, and more inspiring engine of human progress. The future of flight has never looked more promising—innovation, sustainability, and ambition soaring together toward a net-zero horizon!

The global aviation industry is standing at a defining crossroads. As the world accelerates its pursuit of sustainability, air traffic management (ATM) and operations must evolve to meet an undeniably urgent challenge: achieving net—zero CO₂ emissions by 2050. The Operations Roadmap and its partner initiative, the Finance Roadmap, together form an inspiring, action-oriented blueprint for this transformation. They show us that sustainable civil aviation is not just a lofty ambition but a tangible, achievable goal—if we act collaboratively, decisively, and intelligently.

Operations lie at the very heart of aviation’s sustainability journey. Air Traffic Management, as an essential component of national infrastructure, must be prioritized in every strategic conversation about sustainable aviation. It is more than just coordinating airplanes in the sky—it is the nervous system of global aviation, influencing efficiency, fuel use, and ultimately, emissions. Yet today’s ATM systems are riddled with inefficiencies that waste fuel and generate unnecessary CO₂. The exciting truth is that solving these inefficiencies doesn’t require waiting for tomorrow’s technologies—progress can begin *now*. Through smarter routing, better coordination, and more intelligent resource use, operations can deliver meaningful near-term emission reductions.

However, operational improvements can only achieve their full potential through strong alignment and shared vision. Airlines, airports, and Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) must synchronize their investment plans and implementation timelines. Without this integration, even the most advanced ATM programs will struggle to deliver on their promises. Airspace is both a scarce and shared resource, and its effective management demands joint stewardship. By fostering partnerships among stakeholders, the industry can turn local progress into global transformation.

The roadmap identifies several exciting strategies to accelerate progress. Local and regional projects can serve as “proof of concept,” showing the real-world benefits of innovative technologies and operational methods, and helping shape global standards. Benchmarking environmental and performance outcomes will track progress, spotlight best practices, and promote the transition toward Trajectory-Based Operations (TBO)—a more innovative, more predictable way to manage flight paths. Furthermore, regional consortia can ensure that the unique needs of airspace users are respected throughout the planning and implementation phases. Collaboration, transparency, and innovation become the fuel for progress.

The Finance Roadmap, updated in September 2024, complements this operational vision by quantifying the investments required to reach net-zero emissions. Its message is clear: achieving sustainability demands not only technological and procedural innovation but also bold financial commitment. The required average annual investment—around USD 128 billion per year until 2050—may sound enormous. Still, it is far less than what the world has already invested in renewable energy markets like solar and wind. This comparison underscores both the feasibility and necessity of the aviation sector’s transition. Governments also have a crucial role to play: redirecting subsidies from fossil fuels to renewable energy production can accelerate this process dramatically, especially in the scaling of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF).

The Economics team’s projections remind us of the magnitude and urgency of the task. Transition costs—estimated at USD 1.4 billion in 2025 and potentially rising to USD 744 billion by 2050—underline the need for speed, innovation, and scale. Every year of delay increases both the financial and environmental costs. Yet with unified purpose and wise investment, the aviation industry can turn these challenges into opportunities—creating a cleaner, more resilient ecosystem that benefits not just airlines, but all of society.

Adding to the complexity are structural characteristics unique to aviation. Aircraft have incredibly long lifespans—often flying safely for 20 to 30 years. This extended service life is an engineering marvel, but also means that replacing or upgrading airline fleets with newer, cleaner models happens at a measured pace. Furthermore, each aircraft must undergo rigorous certification to meet strict safety and performance standards. These certification processes, while essential, can take a decade or more, delaying the adoption of cutting-edge technology. This ensures public safety but slows innovation cycles compared to other industries.

The Green Sky Race Takes Off: Global Push to Supercharge Sustainable Aviation Fuels

The global race to scale up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production is on, and it’s nothing short of exhilarating! Current project pipelines fall far short of what’s needed—we must multiply capacity by five to six times before 2030 to keep the aviation industry on track for net-zero emissions by 2050. That means bringing both bio-based jet fuels and power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels to market fast, with investments in 300–400 new production plants and supportive infrastructure. The timeline is tight—since it takes at least 5 years to build and commission a SAF plant, planning must begin within the next 2 to 3 years. Clever policy design will be essential, prioritizing sustainable biomass for aviation and leveraging the upcoming electrification of road transport to redirect ethanol toward jet fuel via the alcohol-to-jet process. Combined with optimization of existing HEFA plants to produce more jet fuel, these actions could deliver an additional 14–22 Mt of SAF by 2030—covering up to half of projected demand.

The race to decarbonize aviation is on, and the pace of progress in renewable electricity costs will shape which sustainable fuels take the lead! If renewable power prices drop quickly, Power-to-Liquid (PtL) fuels—produced using renewable electricity and green hydrogen—are poised to soar, capturing a dominant market share by 2050 as outlined in the optimistic ORE scenario. This rapid decline in electricity costs would make green hydrogen and PtL production far more affordable, eventually outcompeting biofuels. However, if renewable power becomes cheaper more slowly, biofuels will remain the frontrunners, provided that sufficient sustainable biomass is available, which underpins the PRU scenario. In reality, the skies of the future will likely be powered by a blend of solutions—biofuels, PtL, and hydrogen—working together to push aviation toward a cleaner, more sustainable future!

By the late 2030s, hydrogen and battery-electric aircraft are poised to transform global aviation, paving the way for cleaner, more efficient skies. Hydrogen-powered planes could debut around 2035 and soar in market share through 2050, supplying up to one-third of aviation’s total energy demand if range and storage breakthroughs continue. Though early models may be limited to roughly 2,500 kilometers due to hydrogen’s lower energy density, innovation in airframe design and fuel storage could soon unlock longer routes without sacrificing passenger capacity. Meanwhile, advances in battery chemistries are opening new horizons for fully electric aircraft, making regional flights up to 1,000 kilometers feasible by mid-century. While electric planes might replace over 15% of the global fleet, their impact on emissions will complement hydrogen’s broader potential. The first step toward this sustainable revolution lies in “green corridors”—dedicated routes between airports equipped for refuelling and recharging—ushering in a new era of cleaner, smarter, and more sustainable aviation.

Flying Into the Future

Achieving this transformation will require much more than incremental improvements. It calls for a sweeping overhaul of technology, infrastructure, and operational practices. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is one of the most promising tools in this effort. Derived from renewable sources like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. To meet future demand, however, production must be scaled up massively—an exciting opportunity for innovation and investment worldwide.

Equally transformative are new technologies such as hydrogen-powered and electric aircraft. Green hydrogen, generated using renewable electricity, could power short-haul flights while producing only water as a byproduct. Electric propulsion, though still in its infancy for commercial aviation, promises silent, zero-emission operations for regional routes. Airports, too, will play a crucial role, evolving into hubs of clean energy complete with charging and hydrogen fuelling infrastructure.

Policy and collaboration will be just as important as technology. Governments, manufacturers, airlines, and fuel producers must coordinate to create incentives, establish clear regulatory frameworks, and invest in research and infrastructure. Incremental progress is already visible: modern aircraft are 80% more fuel-efficient than the first generation of airliners and emit 50% less CO₂ than those flying in 1990. Each new aircraft design improves fuel efficiency by an impressive 15–25%, proving that innovation is part of aviation’s DNA.

The journey to net-zero will not be easy, but it will be exhilarating. It represents an unprecedented opportunity to reinvent an industry that has always symbolized human progress and possibility. By combining visionary technology, sustainable fuels, robust policies, and a spirit of global cooperation, aviation can continue to connect the world—this time, with a lighter footprint and a brighter future. The sky is not just the limit; it’s the beginning of a sustainable revolution in flight.

Boeing’s deepening collaboration with India is a testament to the visionary power of partnerships to propel global aerospace innovation to new heights! As the company strengthens its local MRO capabilities through initiatives like the Boeing India Repair Development and Sustainment (BIRDS) program and continues nurturing talent through programs such as BUILD and the Sukanya initiative, India’s aerospace and defence ecosystem is poised for extraordinary growth as Indian Aerospace & Defence gets exclusive insights from Salil Gupte, President, Boeing India & South Asia on its longstanding zero-tariff commitment and decades of engagement in India that perfectly align with the nation’s ambitious Aatmanirbhar Bharat agenda, fostering self-reliance while nurturing global excellence. In an era marked by evolving trade dynamics and expanding strategic ties between India and the United States, such collaborations promise a future where advanced technological exchange, entrepreneurship, and sustainability drive a resilient aerospace industry—one that not only takes flight but soars beyond boundaries!

Q. In light of Boeing’s expanding engagement with India’s manufacturing sector and its long-standing commitment to maintaining a zero-tariff environment in aerospace and defence since 1979, how might future collaborations between Indian enterprises and global aerospace companies evolve, particularly in the context of shifting geopolitical dynamics and ongoing trade negotiations between India and the United States?

A. Boeing’s manufacturing and engineering footprint remains largely based in the U.S., and so naturally, the U.S. is the cornerstone of our global operations. At the same time, the unique talent and supply chain capabilities in international markets, including India, serve local needs and also enhance our global capabilities, driving advancements for Boeing and the industry. The Joint Statement of President Trump and Prime Minister Modi from earlier this year actually called out the opportunities for collaboration in this regard, as both countries continue to see tremendous potential in working together on industrial development for aerospace & defence. Given Boeing’s eight decades of presence in India, we remain committed to working with local partners, investing in talent development, and meeting the needs of the nation for an aerospace and defence ecosystem.

Q. How have Boeing’s initiatives, such as the Boeing University Innovation Leadership Development (BUILD) program and earlier efforts like the Boeing HorizonX India Innovation Challenge and the Accelerated Aircraft Maintenance Engineers Apprenticeship program, contributed to fostering innovation, entrepreneurship, and skill development within India’s aerospace and defence industry?

A. Boeing’s commitment to developing India’s aerospace talent ecosystem is long-standing. Initiatives such as the Boeing University Innovation Leadership Development (BUILD) program have helped connect young innovators, entrepreneurs, and startups to real-world aerospace challenges, fostering a culture of co-creation and entrepreneurial thinking. The Accelerated Aircraft Maintenance Engineers Apprenticeship program builds hands-on capabilities for high-demand roles in aviation services. The Boeing Sukanya Program, launched in 2024 by the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, promotes women’s participation in aviation through STEM labs, digital skills, and pilot training. The Kaushal initiative supports differently abled individuals and underserved youth with certified training in aircraft maintenance. At the same time, the Veterans Skilling Program has trained over 22,000 ex-servicemen and their families for civilian careers in aerospace. Together, these initiatives reflect Boeing’s long-standing approach: connecting young talent to real-world aerospace challenges and enabling participation. Boeing is helping shape a future-ready workforce that supports India’s journey of aerospace and defence industrialization.

Q. To what extent can Boeing’s initiative to encourage its component suppliers to establish maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) facilities in India be expected to strengthen the country’s aviation ecosystem, and how might this align with India’s broader policy of promoting domestic MRO capabilities through liberalized foreign direct investment and expanding airport infrastructure?

A. Boeing’s efforts to localize Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) capabilities in India are central to its long-term strategy of supporting operational efficiency, economic growth, and self-reliance across the aviation ecosystem. The Boeing India Repair Development and Sustainment (BIRDS) program is a cornerstone of this approach, designed to build a robust MRO infrastructure for both defence and commercial platforms. By combining resources across civil and defence sectors, BIRDS enhances cost-effectiveness, reduces turnaround times, and introduces advanced defence technologies into civil aviation, fostering innovation across both domains.

These efforts directly support India’s Aatmanirbhar Bharat vision. Boeing’s in-country development includes state-of-the-art facilities such as the C-17 MRO and training center at Hindon and the P-8I training facility at Rajali, which ensure operational readiness and set industry benchmarks for excellence. The program also creates high-skilled jobs, attracts foreign investment, and fosters the growth of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Where more work remains is in component and engine MRO. That’s why Boeing is actively encouraging OEM partners to deepen their footprint in India. As customs, tax, and repair-exchange norms evolve, India is well-positioned to become a regional MRO hub, retaining maintenance spend that previously flowed overseas and strengthening its aviation infrastructure.

Q. How is India’s air cargo and freighter segment expected to evolve, and which structural or market forces are influencing its growth?

A. Approximately half of the global demand for conversions is expected to come from the regions of Asia and Africa, including India. This is driven by the rapid expansion of e-commerce and the electronics manufacturing industry, which has revolutionized customer expectations and supply chain needs. Global e-commerce revenues are projected to reach more than double pre-pandemic levels by 2026, with air cargo playing a key role in emerging markets lacking well-established ground and postal networks. The rise of high-end electronics manufacturing in India, such as smartphones and wearables, along with other high-value-added manufacturing, like semiconductors, is creating opportunities for future air cargo growth.

India’s domestic air cargo trade is forecasted to continue rapid growth at 6.9% per year over the next two decades. The growth is driven by factors including the overall expansion of the Indian economy and increased demand for air cargo transportation. Furthermore, the expansion of India’s e-commerce sector is contributing to the demand for efficient and reliable logistics and transportation solutions. This has led to the entry of cargo carriers into the Indian market that are operating a range of freighters, including the Boeing 737-800 Boeing Converted Freighter, to cater to the growing demand for air cargo services.

Q. What kind of role do you see Boeing play in the growth of India’s civil aviation sector in the coming years?

A. With a partnership spanning over eight decades, Boeing is today the largest foreign OEM sourcing from India through a network of over 325 suppliers, including more than 25% MSMEs that form an integral part of our global supply chain. Supporting the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative is central to our long-term strategy. Partnerships are crucial for supporting India’s aviation growth while improving operational efficiency and ensuring safety. Boeing is also open to supporting India’s Regional Transport Aircraft (RTA) programme, which aims to develop a commuter aircraft with a range of 600–700 km. We see an opportunity to support advanced manufacturing to help India scale production efficiently. This initiative aligns with India’s long-term aviation and industrial ambitions and complements our broader commitment to building a robust ecosystem, including pilot training, MRO, and aerospace industrialisation. Additionally, some of the recent contributions made by Boeing include the following:

In 2025, we partnered with HPCL to help advance India’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) ecosystem and support the Indian Government’s environmental goals.

In 2024, in alignment with the guidance provided by the Honorable Prime Minister, Boeing initiated the Boeing Sukanya Program aimed at promoting women’s participation and leadership in aviation through STEM education and scholarships.

In 2024, Boeing set up the India Distribution Center in Khurja, Uttar Pradesh, for regional customers to maintain higher fleet utilization and mission readiness rates.

In 2023, Boeing and GMR Aero Technic are partnering to establish a new Boeing Converted Freighter line in Hyderabad. This collaboration supports cargo growth and expands aircraft modification capabilities and MRO services in India. It contributes to India’s ambition of becoming a regional MRO hub.

India is a strategically vital region for Boeing, supported by its Global Strategic Initiatives team and the establishment of a Global Support Center in Gurugram. Together, these efforts drive growth, safety, innovation, and sustainability through key programs like the India Air Cargo Symposium, India Pilot Roundtable, Executive Development Programs, Sustainability Workshops, and tailored operational efficiency projects for airline customers, regulatory bodies, and industry stakeholders.

To support the growing demand for pilots and technicians, in 2023, Boeing announced a $100 million investment in infrastructure and programs to train pilots in India, which will support India’s need for new pilots over the next 20 years.

In 2023, we shipped the first 737 vertical fin from our joint-venture facility, Tata Boeing Aerospace Limited (TBAL) in Hyderabad.

From a modest 2.3 gigawatt (GW) of solar module capacity in 2014, the country now boasts 109 GW of capacity, supported by 100 manufacturers and 123 production units. Yet this rapid expansion is now running into the hard reality of demand. With annual solar installations expected to be only 45–50 GW - against 60–65 GW of available module production - the industry is staring straight at an overcapacity issue, say experts.

A fast-growing domestic solar industry

Until 2014, India depended almost entirely on China for solar cells and modules to meet its ambition of reaching 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. A series of policy interventions under Atma Nirbhar Bharat — the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM), which almost blocked imports, basic customs duties on imported modules and cells, and the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, changed the domestic industry landscape.

The ALMM order came into force in January 2019. When the first list was published in March 2021, India had just 8.2 GW of enlisted module capacity across 21 manufacturers. In just over four years, this surged more than twelvefold to 100 GW of ALMM-listed capacity, with the number of manufacturers rising nearly fivefold to 100, with 123 manufacturing units.

The annual Fortune India special issue of India’s Best CEOs celebrates leaders who have transformed their businesses while navigating an uncertain environment, leading from the front.

As of September 2025, India’s manufacturing base stands at 109 GW of modules and 17.9 GW of cells — one of the fastest build-outs globally. And yet, the expansion continues.

The Problem of Plenty

Industry projections indicate that India’s module capacity will touch 130 GW and cell capacity 35 GW by March 2026. By March 2027, capacities may reach 165 GW for modules and 70 GW for cells. The implementation of ALMM List-II for solar PV cells from June 2026 has fuelled further investments in cell lines by module makers.

“Cell manufacturing capacity is likely to grow to about 100 GW by December 2027, from 17.9 GW currently under ALMM,” notes rating agency ICRA.

Domestic installation demand — at 45–50 GW per year — simply cannot absorb the 60–65 GW of modules rolling off production lines annually. And with the recent US tariffs redirecting exports back to India, the domestic glut is worsening, say sources.

On the Cusp of Consolidation

ICRA expects overcapacity to squeeze margins and accelerate consolidation among the country’s 100-odd OEMs. Seven large players today control nearly half of India’s installed module capacity, and that share is likely to rise as smaller players come under pressure.

“The operating profitability of domestic solar OEMs, which stayed elevated at 25% in FY2025, is set to moderate due to competitive pressures and overcapacity,” says Ankit Jain, Vice President & Co-Group Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA.

Adding to their challenges is the increase in uncertainty in the US — a key export market — following new tariff measures. The redirection of shipments to India is likely to intensify price competition further.

There’s also a cost disadvantage. Modules made with domestic cells cost 3–4 cents per watt more than those made with imported cells. While modules using imported cells land at around 16 cents/W, domestically sourced cells push the cost to 19.5 cents/W, says the ICRA analysis.

A reprieve comes from the exemption available to projects whose bid submission deadline falls before September 1, 2025 — a 45–50 GW pipeline that will not require ALMM-listed domestic cells even after June 2026. This should support non-integrated OEMs in the near term, although bidding activity has slowed recently, observes ICRA.

Despite India’s impressive strides, China still towers over the global solar supply chain — accounting for over 90% of polysilicon and wafer, 85% of cell, and 80% of module manufacturing capacity worldwide. Indian manufacturers remain heavily dependent on imported wafers and ingots, leaving them vulnerable to geopolitical risks and supply disruptions.

Backward integration into polysilicon and wafer manufacturing demands far higher technological sophistication — and billions in capital. Building these capacities, stabilising them, and reducing China-dependence remain among the toughest challenges ahead. Already, large corporates like Reliance Industries and Adani Group are investing billions to create an entire solar equipment value chain.","https://media.fortuneindia.com/fortune-india/import/2022-08/c1aab1bd-f4d4-4357-8862-5dbe9986532e/Solar_GettyImages_1327629473_copy.jpg?rect=0,44,3000,1575&w=1200&ar=40:21&auto=format,compress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100",N,,2025-11-16 10:57:33.978987

Singapura menjadi negara pertama di dunia yang menerapkan pungutan pajak bahan bakar hijau (Sustainable Aviation Fuel/SAF) bagi penumpang pesawat yang berangkat dari Singapura. Meski demikian, kebijakan serupa dinilai belum cocok jika diterapkan di Indonesia.

Pengamat penerbangan, Alvin Lie, menjelaskan Indonesia memang memiliki mandatori dengan target kandungan 2 persen mulai tahun 2026. Namun, cara yang dilakukan Singapura tak cocok karena penumpang pesawat di Indonesia sangat sensitif terhadap harga.

“Harga SAF saat ini masih berkisar 300 sampai 400 persen dari avtur konvensional. Kewajiban penggunaan SAF akan berakibat naiknya harga tiket secara signifikan seperti di Singapura. Padahal penumpang kita sangat sensitif terhadap harga,” kata Alvin kepada kumparan, Minggu (16/11).

Selain itu, Alvin juga menyoroti mengenai Tarif Batas Atas (TBA) yang belum diubah oleh pemerintah sejak 2019. Jika nantinya Indonesia menerapkan cara seperti Singapura untuk mengejar target penggunaan SAF, ia mengkhawatirkan daya beli penumpang.

“Pemerintah tidak mau menaikan (TBA) walau biaya operasi airlines sudah naik signifikan. Pada tahun 2019 ketika TBA ditetapkan nilai tukar Rp12.500 per USD. Sekarang Rp 16.700. Saat itu harga avtur Rp 9.500. Bulan November 2025 Rp 13.111 per liter. Apakah daya beli konsumen kita akan mampu menerima kenaikan tersebut? (Jika Indonesia pakai cara Singapura),” ujarnya.

Maka dari itu, menurut Alvin cara seperti Singapura yang menambah pungutan untuk SAF baru bisa dilakukan jika pemerintah sudah berani mengubah TBA yang menurutnya sudah usang. Selain itu, edukasi kepada penumpang pesawat sebagai konsumen mengenai SAF juga perlu terus dilakukan.

“Pemerintah perlu edukasi konsumen tentang mengapa perlu beralih ke SAF dan apa konsekuensinya. Ketika konsumen kita sudah siap, baru jalankan kebijakan tersebut. Jika tidak, pasar penerbangan kita (terutama domestik) akan menyusut,” kata Alvin.

Adapun edukasi mengenai SAF menurutnya bisa dilakukan dengan kampanye tentang dampak perubahan iklim, gas rumah kaca serta komitmen Indonesia untuk mencapai Net Zero Emission pada tahun 2060.

Sebelumnya, pungutan SAF di Singapura akan dikenakan untuk tiket yang dijual mulai 1 April untuk penerbangan yang berangkat dari Singapura mulai 1 Oktober. Selain penumpang, pajak tambahan tersebut juga akan dikenakan pada penerbangan kargo di mana pajak tambahan akan berdasarkan beban barang per kilogram. Meski demikian, penumpang yang hanya transit di Singapura tak akan dikenakan pajak tambahan tersebut.

Berdasarkan keterangan dari Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), penumpang kelas ekonomi dan ekonomi premium untuk penerbangan ke Asia Tenggara akan dikenakan pajak tambahan sebesar SGD 1, Asia Timur, Asia Selatan, Australia dan Papua Nugini sebesar SGD 2,80, Afrika, sebagian Asia, Eropa, Timur Tengah, Pasifik, dan Selandia Baru sebesar SGD 6,40 dan penerbangan ke Amerika akan dikenakan pajak tambahan sebesar SGD 10,4.","https://blue.kumparan.com/image/upload/fl_progressive,fl_lossy,f_jpg,q_auto,w_600,h_315,c_fill/g_south,l_og_kumparan_zscykb/co_rgb:ffffff,g_south_west,l_text:Heebo_20_bold:Konten%20Redaksi%20kumparan%0DkumparanBISNIS,x_140,y_26/01hypwf6qxcjrbs1v4ypecm8f0.jpg",N,,2025-11-16 10:57:40.329679

To the eco-minded, it might seem a reasonable expense for a healthier planet. But for backpackers heading to Bali on a budget, it might feel like a sting. Singapore, a major player in Southeast Asian aviation, is making a move by adding a ""green fuel tax"" to plane tickets, with the revenue going towards greener aviation.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) says the levy will apply to plane tickets bought from April 1, 2025, for flights taking off after October 1, 2025. The cost, ranging from about S$1 (US$0.77) to S$41.60 (US$31.95), depends on the flight's distance and the class you're flying in – economy pays less, while business and first-class cough up more, sometimes four times as much. Short flights around Southeast Asia? Just S$1 for economy seats. Long journeys, like to the Americas? S$10.40, rising to S$41.60 for premium seats. If you're just passing through Changi, no tax for you. Cargo flights will also have a surcharge per kilogram, so everyone contributes.

Pioneering the Path to Sustainable Skies

What makes Singapore's move special? It's not just another airport fee; it's a tax that's explicitly linked to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). SAFs are eco-friendly fuel blends made from waste oils, agricultural leftovers, or even captured CO2, but they're pricier. So far, no other country has done this, making Singapore a leader in green aviation. Changi Airport, famous for its orchids and butterflies, is on track to beat its 2019 record of 68.3 million passengers this year, making this initiative all the more important.

Interestingly, SAF prices have recently fallen, meaning CAAS could reduce the levy from its initial S$3 to S$16 range. As a CAAS representative pointed out, this change shows their dedication to keeping travel affordable while pushing for decarbonization. The levy, they said, is central to Singapore's broader environmental plans.

Fueling the Future

Every cent from the levy will be used to buy SAF in bulk, reducing aviation's carbon footprint one flight at a time. Singapore aims to have SAF make up 3-5% of jet fuel use by 2030, quite a jump from today's almost zero. This is a big challenge, given the industry uses 300 billion liters of conventional kerosene each year globally. While aviation currently accounts for just 1.2% of global greenhouse gases, this percentage could increase as passenger numbers are expected to double by 2050.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has reported that SAF production doubled last year. However, it still only accounts for about 0.3% of all jet fuel used. This situation clearly shows how difficult it is to obtain SAF at scale. The high costs (SAF can be 2-4 times more expensive than fossil fuels) and scaling issues make this transition ""challenging but necessary"", according to an analyst. Singapore's levy could inspire other regions, like the EU (which has its own SAF targets), to take similar steps.

Mixed Reactions

The announcement has been met with both approval and worry. Environmentalists are calling it a ""bold, necessary step,"" and groups such as the World Wildlife Fund are happy to see a direct link between passenger fares and emissions reductions. Airlines, including Singapore Airlines and Scoot, seem to be supportive, viewing centralized SAF purchasing as a way to stabilize volatile SAF markets.

Not everyone's happy, though. Some industry observers are warning that the green fuel tax could hurt competitiveness, particularly for budget airlines flying to India and Indonesia. The Asian Travel and Tourism Association worries that the levy may ""price out leisure travelers"" at a time when Asia's aviation sector is still recovering. Social media discussions reflect this divide: hashtags like #GreenTaxSG are trending, with both humorous ""eco-farewells"" and serious commitments to offset flights. Initial research points to limited deterrent effect—the majority of air travelers express a willingness to contribute for the benefit of environmental initiatives—although budget-conscious flyers voice concerns regarding the accumulation of fees on top of already escalating fuel expenses.

Clearing the Air: A Blueprint for the World?

With Changi Airport witnessing unprecedented levels of air traffic, Singapore's approach hinges on widespread public acceptance: a small fee added to each ticket to fund environmental sustainability efforts. Should it prove effective, it could serve as a model for worldwide environmental responsibility, prompting hesitant governments from Tokyo to Toronto to take action. Detractors, however, argue that genuine change necessitates groundbreaking technologies, not merely incremental surcharges—for instance, electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles or hydrogen-powered aircraft in the future.

Currently, the skies above the equator are incrementally greener, achieved through a step-by-step levy system.

A UK pilot has been formally recognised for her work in pushing this future forward.

Thanks to this recognition, it’s a moment for travellers to understand what flying greener means—and how it may affect travel choices and experiences.

What’s Happened?

The British monarch has honoured a pilot who has long campaigned for sustainable flying. According to media reports, she has been appointed an OBE for her efforts in the aviation sector championing net zero flights.

She is also chair of the UK government‑industry group focused on zero‑emission flight technology.

For travellers, this means more than an award—it signals that airports and airlines in the UK are shifting gear towards greener options.

Why It Matters to Travellers

When you book a flight or choose a destination, the broader aviation industry is under pressure to reduce its carbon footprint.

The UK’s government has set out the Jet Zero Strategy: Delivering Net‑Zero Aviation by 2050, which lays out how the country plans to achieve zero‑emission aviation by 2050.

For you as a global traveller, this means:

You may see more flights using sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs).

Airports might start offering more green services or options.

Future travel could include aircraft that are electric or hydrogen‑powered (at least for shorter hops).

It’s about flying smarter, not just flying further.

What the UK Is Doing

Here are key actions from the UK that directly affect travel:

The government launched a group to make zero‑emission flights a reality—led by that same pilot.

UK policy documents stress that aviation must decarbonise while preserving the ability to travel globally.

Travellers can expect incremental changes: from fuel type and aircraft tech, to airport infrastructure and regulation.

In short: The path to net zero aviation flights is being paved now.

What Travellers Should Watch For

Since you (TTW) might care about travel experiences and destinations, here are things to keep in mind:

Check if your airline or departure airport mentions sustainable aviation fuel usage or green initiatives.

Short‑haul flights might evolve more quickly than long‑haul ones when it comes to zero‑emission tech.

Airports in the UK (and globally) may begin highlighting their “greener” credentials: less noise, cleaner fuel, smarter operations.

While prices may not jump solely because of sustainability yet, cost structures could change as technology scales.

By choosing airlines or routes that emphasise these green credentials, you’re aligning with a trend rather than later catching up.

Travel Tips for the Greener Flyer

If possible, pick flights from major UK airports that have announced sustainability commitments.

Ask your airline about SAF usage or aircraft efficiency—many now provide sustainability info.

Consider connecting flights or shorter hops where newer tech may already be in operation.

Monitor airports’ website pages for travellers: some may start offering “green traveller” guides or information on infrastructure upgrades.

Stay flexible—marks of sustainable travel may change rapidly in the next few years, so being aware gives you an edge.

A Bigger Picture for the Industry—and You

For the industry, this isn’t just about decarbonising; it’s about staying viable for future generations, preserving global connectivity, and making travel both possible and greener.

For you, the traveller, it means the flying experience may shift to something that feels more responsible without sacrificing adventure.

This recognition of the UK pilot is symbolic: it says the days of ignoring aviation’s climate impact are ending. Travel can remain thrilling—but now with a conscious edge.

IKFINA RAHMAH AULA Editor's Choice: One Direction Singer Liam Payne Passes Away After Falling from Buenos Aires Balcony","TEMPO.CO, Jakarta -Rumors of Zayn Malik returning to One Direction have once again stirred up excitement among fans. Two different media reports from Complex and The Sun present contrasting narratives: one claims it's just an administrative change, while the other asserts that Zayn is returning as a director of the group. A minor shift in legal documents has turned into widespread speculation about the reunion of one of the biggest boy bands of the past decade.

Explosive Speculation from Company Documents

The commotion started with updates to the documents of PPM Music Limited, the company overseeing One Direction's business affairs. The Sun reported that Zayn Malik has ""returned"" as an active director as of November 3, 2025, based on data from Companies House in the UK. This claim was immediately seen as a sign of his return after a decade of leaving the group that propelled his fame.

The report also linked the circulating rumors of a reunion to the tragic death of Liam Payne in 2024, which was said to have ""brought the members back together."" This narrative strengthens the assumption that the administrative change is not without reason, but rather a signal of musical movement behind the scenes.

The Sun emphasized that although there has been no announcement of a new project, Zayn's return to the company's structure is seen as a definite step towards a One Direction reunion, an issue that has continued to haunt the pop music world since the group went on hiatus in 2016.

Denial: No Evidence of Zayn Malik Rejoining the Group

However, Complex presented a much more cautious perspective. The media outlet affirmed that Zayn did not return as an active director based on the latest data, and the surfaced address change was just a routine administrative update. They stated that Zayn's status remains in the category of ""individual with significant influence or control,"" not a director.

The article also reminded that address changes or routine documents are often misinterpreted by fans as a sign of a reunion, although there is no evidence pointing to any new musical activity. Furthermore, the active directors in the company's files are two industry executives, not former group members.

Complex concluded its report emphatically, stating that there is currently no indication that Zayn Malik has truly returned to One Direction, either as a member or as part of a reunion plan.

Amidst the two contrasting narratives, one thing is for sure: the minor administrative dynamics of PPM Music Limited have once again fueled public longing for one of the biggest pop phenomena of the 2010s. These two versions of the news show how fans' longing can magnify even the smallest movement into a global reunion discourse.

Air Algérie has made a significant stride in its long-haul expansion by introducing its first Airbus A330neo. This milestone aircraft marks the beginning of a comprehensive fleet renewal program that aims to solidify Air Algérie’s position as a leader in long-haul travel from Algiers. With the new A330neo, the airline is now ready to expand its network to include key destinations such as Montreal, Guangzhou, and Beijing, with plans to extend further to other international cities in the coming years.

What is Air Algérie’s A330neo?

Air Algérie’s new Airbus A330-900, delivered on November 14, 2025, is the first of eight aircraft from an order that will position the airline as the largest operator of the A330neo in Africa. The aircraft’s introduction is a major step towards modernizing the airline’s fleet of widebody jets, particularly for long-haul flights.

The A330neo is equipped with a new three-class cabin configuration, offering 18 Business Class seats with full-flat beds, 24 Premium Economy seats, and 266 Economy Class seats. The aircraft features Airbus’ innovative Airspace cabin, which focuses on passenger comfort and well-being with more personal space, enlarged overhead storage, modern cabin lighting, and advanced in-flight entertainment and connectivity options. These upgrades aim to provide passengers with an elevated travel experience on long flights, particularly on routes such as Algiers to Montreal, Guangzhou, and Beijing.

Why is the A330neo Important for Air Algérie?

Air Algérie’s fleet renewal, which includes the addition of the A330neo, is a strategic move to enhance its long-haul operations and expand its international network. The airline has already begun deploying the aircraft on specific routes, with the inaugural flight to Montreal, Canada, marking the start of commercial operations for the A330neo. This expansion is part of Air Algérie’s broader ambition to increase its presence in the transatlantic and Asian markets.

The A330neo’s fuel efficiency, with compatibility for up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), aligns with Air Algérie’s commitment to sustainability. The airline is also investing in the development of a maintenance and training infrastructure to support the A330neo, ensuring that it can provide excellent service and reliability for its passengers.

When Will Air Algérie’s A330neo Begin Operations?

The A330neo is already in service, with the first commercial flight taking place on November 15, 2025, from Algiers to Montreal. This route will provide enhanced capacity on a key transatlantic link. Air Algérie is also operating the A330neo on the newly launched Algiers-Guangzhou route, which began on October 27, 2025, with three weekly flights. Additionally, the airline has increased the frequency of its Algiers-Beijing route to three times weekly, starting from October 28, 2025.

Looking ahead, Air Algérie plans to expand its network even further, with additional destinations in Canada, China, and possibly other international markets. The A330neo’s capabilities are expected to support the airline’s goal of increasing its long-haul operations and growing its international reach.

Where Will Air Algérie’s A330neo Operate?

The first A330neo is already deployed on several key routes:

Algiers to Montreal (YUL) – The inaugural commercial flight began on November 15, 2025.

Algiers to Guangzhou (CAN) – Launched on October 27, 2025, this is currently the longest nonstop flight for the A330neo.

Algiers to Beijing (PEK) – Increased frequency to three weekly flights, starting October 28, 2025.

Additionally, while direct A330neo flights to other destinations in Asia and beyond have yet to be announced, Air Algérie’s partnership with Qatar Airways provides connections to locations such as Kuala Lumpur and Muscat.

How Will the A330neo Impact Air Algérie’s Fleet and Operations?

The addition of the Airbus A330neo is a critical component of Air Algérie’s broader strategy to modernize its fleet and improve its long-haul service offerings. By 2026, Air Algérie aims to have the A330neo operating on more than 60 international routes, enhancing its competitiveness in the global airline market.

The airline’s investment in a dedicated maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) facility, as well as a training center for A330neo operations, will ensure that the carrier can meet the growing demand for these flights while maintaining high service standards.

The world’s first commercial-scale Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) plant is now fully operational, marking a critical milestone for the aviation sector. This development immediately de-risks the global Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) supply chain by validating a new pathway. This pathway is scalable, unlocking ethanol feedstocks that are more abundant than the limited supply of used cooking oil (HEFA) currently dominating the market.

For the aviation manufacturing process, this means a proven, non-fossil fuel source is ready to deliver real volume, providing a viable path to meet tightening global mandates. The plant’s initial capacity is up to 10 million gallons of fuel per year, proving the technology’s readiness to deliver commercial-scale output.

Context

The industry consensus was that the primary SAF pathway, HEFA, would soon hit a “feedstock wall” due to the finite supply of used cooking oil and animal fats. The informed professional was therefore wondering if any of the next-generation technologies, such as Alcohol-to-Jet, could successfully transition from pilot projects to reliable, commercial-scale production before 2030 to meet the aggressive global decarbonization mandates.

Analysis

The cause is the successful integration and operation of a proprietary catalytic process that chemically converts ethanol into long-chain hydrocarbons suitable for jet fuel. This breakthrough is the result of 15 years of research and development, backed by significant investment from major aviation and energy players. Manufacturers and fuel producers are expected to react by accelerating Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) on ATJ-based plants globally, as the technology is now a proven reference design. Think of the ATJ process like a chemical “Lego set” that takes simple, abundant ethanol building blocks and rearranges them into the complex, high-energy molecules required for jet fuel, bypassing the need for crude oil.

Outlook

This development implies a significant acceleration in the diversification of the SAF market, shifting the focus from feedstock scarcity to technology deployment. The simple thing to watch next is the announcement of Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) for new, large-scale ATJ plants in regions with strong ethanol supply chains, such as Europe and Asia. These FIDs will confirm the global replication of this proven commercial model.",https://news.sustainability-directory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bio-based-feedstock-integration-with-petrochemical-infrastructure-for-circular-economy-transition.jpeg,N,,2025-11-16 02:56:31.415986

The Massachusetts Port Authority has been working for years to expand Lawrence G. Hanscom Field with 17 new hangars. Opponents have decried the atmospheric pollution caused by private jet travel, while the Authority has claimed that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) would help cut emissions.

""SAF won't help the Commonwealth reduce emissions. Period. It will not scale at the pace of climate change,"" said Chuck Collins of the Institute for Policy Studies, per the CommonWealth Beacon. ""It is a diversion of money and attention in this moment.""

Airlines have been eager to tout sustainable aviation fuel innovation as a solution to growing emissions, though the credibility of some of their claims has been called into question.

Luxury air travel generates a massive amount of pollution, given how many people use it. One study suggested it would take 207 years for the average Amazon employee to emit as much as CEO Jeff Bezos' two private jets. Emissions like these exacerbate destructive floods, droughts, and heatwaves. The aftermath of these patterns, in turn, incurs agricultural, housing, ecological, and other costs.

While governments need to hold the elite accountable for their damaging travel habits, individuals can choose low-impact travel options, such as commuter rail. These can help mitigate the worst impacts of climate shifts.

Many Massachusetts politicians see the inherent hypocrisy of supporting private jet travel in their own backyard and have openly opposed it.

""There is no way you can put in a whole bunch of essentially garages for private jets and still claim ever again, at least in the living memory of those of us in the room, to be concerned about climate.

While it would be ideal for this funding to go toward the development of solar-powered phones, the company's investment in energy offsetting is quite impactful.

Apple has signed contracts with multiple solar farms across Europe, totaling 650 megawatts of renewable power, according to TechCrunch. This power offsets more energy use of 1.5 billion iPhone users worldwide, as well as Mac Pros and Apple Watches, which together account for almost one-third of Apple's carbon footprint.

The solar farms will be spread out across Europe in Greece, Latvia, Spain, Poland, Romania, and Italy. Currently, more than 90% of Apple's manufacturing in China is powered by renewable energy, and it will also invest $150 million to raise that percentage further.

A notable fact about this news is that Apple has announced it on all of its international websites but not on its U.S. press site, potentially to avoid drawing attention or backlash from the Trump Administration, which has ended multiple clean energy projects and removed incentives.

Apple earned almost $400 billion in revenue from iPhones alone in 2024, according to Business of Apps. As one of the most profitable businesses in the world and one with a high carbon footprint, its energy offset is an incredible step toward reducing that.

Apple's goal is to power 100% of its products with clean energy by 2030. This sets a stellar example for other companies around the world to do the same. Its investment also helps lower the overall cost of solar and wind power, as their prevalence increases, making it more affordable for everyone.

Fossil fuels, also known as dirty energy, are non-renewable and expected to deplete over the next 30 to 60 years, according to Investopedia. Exposure to these fuels in our air can also cause respiratory issues, such as asthma and lung cancer, and stroke.

The resolution further urged States to implement ICAO-approved SAF accounting and registry systems, and support cost-effective production pathways such as co-processing.

Supply Chain Strengthening: The Assembly called for targeted investment incentives and regulatory harmonisation to enhance regional MRO and manufacturing capabilities. It also supported the adoption of circular economy principles, including recycling and reuse of serviceable aircraft materials.

Aviation Safety: A resolution focused on lithium batteries was passed, calling on regulators to align practices with ICAO guidance for the safe carriage of spare lithium batteries, and to enhance data sharing and public outreach materials on the carriage and usage of lithium batteries by passengers.

Taxes and Charges: The Assembly called on regulators to refrain from imposing taxes or charges on international air transport that are not cost-related or consistent with ICAO guidance, cautioning against measures that add an unnecessary financial burden on airlines, or which impede sustainable air transport growth.

AAPA expects international passenger traffic to continue expanding in line with long-term trends, supported by a growing services sector and rising regional connectivity. The outlook for air cargo demand remains broadly positive, but subject to uncertainties from global trade policies and elevated costs, including those from new U.S. tariffs and limited SAF availability. “AAPA airlines are optimistic,” said Menon. “Our focus in 2026 will be to advance aviation safety and sustainability across the Asia Pacific region, strengthen supply resilience in collaboration with regulators and suppliers, and promote air transport connectivity.”

Airbus: APAC will need 19,560 new planes over 20 years:

The Asia Pacific region is projected to require 19,560 new narrowbody and widebody planes over the next 20 years, majorly driven by demand from India and China, Airbus Asia Pacific President Anand Stanley told the AAPA conference. The demand, Airbus said, represents 46% of the global requirement for 42,520 new aircraft over the timeframe of 20 years. India and China are driving a major portion of the growth, Stanley said.",https://asianaviation.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_1714188886-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 19:56:21.131972

This inaugural service, powered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), represents not only Thailand’s first low-cost carrier flight on this route using clean energy but also a major step forward in regional cooperation to reduce carbon emissions and promote eco-friendly travel across ASEAN tourism corridors. The program highlights Thailand’s strategic role in fostering environmental leadership within the aviation sector while enhancing its global tourism appeal.

Strategic Partnership Advancing Regional Green Aviation

The Green Route initiative is a collaboration involving the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), VietJet Thailand, and PTT Oil and Retail Business Public Company Limited (PTT OR). The historic inaugural flight on November 6, 2025, from Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok demonstrates the region’s commitment to reducing aviation’s carbon footprint through technological innovation and cross-sectoral partnerships.

This collaboration links Thailand’s tourism aspirations with energy sector expertise to accelerate the deployment of cleaner aviation fuel resources, setting an example for integrated sustainable tourism growth.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Critical to Low-Carbon Tourism

Sustainable aviation fuel, produced from renewable and waste-based feedstocks such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and biogas, adheres to stringent international standards (ASTM D7566) and performs comparably to conventional Jet A-1 fuels. The adoption of SAF on the Bangkok–Phu Quoc route marks a tangible reduction in carbon emissions, cutting approximately two hundred fifty kilograms of CO₂ per flight and achieving up to eighty percent emissions reduction on a lifecycle basis.

VietJet Thailand’s goal is to blend SAF at a five-percent level across its fleet by 2030, contributing to a cumulative reduction of more than one hundred fifty-three thousand tonnes of CO₂ within six years. This transition supports Thailand’s overarching national goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, reflecting global trends toward environmental accountability in tourism infrastructure.

Enhancing Tourism Through Environmental Leadership

TAT’s strong endorsement of VietJet’s Green Route reflects Thailand’s evolving approach to responsible tourism, promoting travel experiences that minimize environmental impacts while sustaining economic benefits.

As a state-owned airline, Air Algérie is in the process of making a long, multi-year capital investment in the renewal of its long-haul fleet.
From a strategic perspective, the Airbus A330neo gives Air Algérie a more compelling platform to pursue its ambition of ultimately turning Algiers into a North African hub that will link Europe, Africa, the Americas, and Asia.","Air Algerie has recently become the world's newest operator of the Airbus A330neo, after taking delivery of its first A330-900 model. This jet is the first of eight aircraft on order by the carrier. The widebody marks a major step in modernizing the flag carrier's long-haul fleet and deepening its relationship with Airbus, with the aircraft configured with around 308 seats across three cabins.

The jet introduces Air Algerie's most competitive onboard product to date, and it is powered by fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines. The new aircraft type will support growth from Algiers on longer-haul markets, including additional transatlantic and Asian routes, all while positioning the carrier as the largest African operator of the Airbus A330neo once all deliveries have been fully completed.

What Are The Key Developments In This Story?

The first Airbus A330-900neo, which was delivered from Toulouse and bears registration 7T-VTA, inaugurates an eight-strong order that is set to reach complete fulfillment by 2027. The aircraft features 18 full-flat business-class seats in a 1-2-1 layout, alongside 24 premium-economy seats and 266 in the economy cabin, combining for a total of 308 passengers. This is an upgrade in both capacity and comfort over the airline's Airbus A330-200s.

Airbus' Airspace cabin adds larger bins, updated lighting, and next-generation in-flight entertainment and overall connectivity. The jet is powered by a pair of Trent 7000 engines, and it is certified for use of up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel, with manufacturer Airbus targeting 100% SAF usage by 2030. Air Algérie plans to deploy the type on routes such as Algiers to Montreal and future services to Beijing and Guangzhou, as well as other long-haul markets. In its statement regarding the delivery, Airbus had the following words to share:

""Air Algérie will position itself as a center of excellence for the A330neo, supported by the development of its maintenance and repair capabilities and the establishment of a maintenance training center.""

What Are The Financial Benefits The A330neo Offers?

From a financial perspective, the Airbus A330neo fleet helps Air Algérie reshape its long-haul cost base. The Trent 7000-powered Airbus A330-900 offers a roughly 25% lower fuel burn and lower carbon emissions per seat over older-generation widebodies. This is ultimately a critical lever at a time when fuel prices are elevated, and environmental regulations only continue to tighten.

With 308 seats in comparison to 263 on existing Airbus A330-200s, the aircraft can help lower unit costs as fixed cockpit and maintenance costs are spread out across more passengers, provided the airline is able to maintain its load factors. As a state-owned airline, Air Algérie is in the process of making a long, multi-year capital investment in the renewal of its long-haul fleet.

The eight Airbus A330neos the airline will be ordering are set to join additional purchase orders for the Airbus A350-1000, which have already been announced by the carrier, a move that allows the airline to lock in a modern, homogenous fleet for the next decade. In the near-term, depreciation costs as well as financing costs for the acquisition will rise, and the airline is ultimately betting that the improved operating economics of the A330neo, alongside higher-yield potential in premium cabins, will help enhance profitability on key trunk routes and support sustainable growth in long-haul revenue.

What Are The Strategic Benefits The A330neo Brings To The Table?

From a strategic perspective, the Airbus A330neo gives Air Algérie a more compelling platform to pursue its ambition of ultimately turning Algiers into a North African hub that will link Europe, Africa, the Americas, and Asia. The aircraft's comfortable range of around 7,200 nautical miles (13,334 km) covers current endpoints of the airline's network, including Montreal and Beijing, while offering additional flexibility to serve these kinds of markets.

The aircraft will offer a competitive three-cabin product with true long-haul business-class seating that will help win over some higher-yielding travelers. The airline's principal competitors are European legacy carriers and flag airlines from the Gulf.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_1209484417.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-15 18:56:09.625267

Further altering the way bacteria produce the cellulose could open up other uses of the material, such as biodegradable packaging, he said.","When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.

Scientists have used genetically engineered bacteria to simultaneously create and color fabrics in a one-pot method. Compared with current methods that rely on fossil fuels, the new technique offers a simpler and more sustainable way to produce colored textiles.

In a new study described Nov. 12 in the journal Trends in Biotechnology, the researchers created cellulose-based fabrics spanning the colors of the rainbow by altering the conditions used to grow the bacteria.

Synthetic fibers rely ""heavily on chemical synthesis and post-treatment steps that are energy-intensive, laborious, and environmentally harmful,"" said study lead author Sang Yup Lee, a professor in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. Such processes can generate large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions and contaminate water and soil with heavy metals and carcinogens, Lee told Live Science in an email.

Therefore, in recent years, there has been a growing trend to use an alternative method of producing natural fibers from the fermentation of bacteria. Cellulose is a promising target, as this material mimics the natural fibers found in fabrics such as cotton. A wide range of bacteria ordinarily convert glucose into fibers of cellulose to lend structural support and defend against other microbes. However, cellulose produced by bacteria is naturally white, which means it often needs to be dyed after processing.

Lee and his team have now simplified this process by growing cellulose-producing bacteria alongside microbes that produce natural colorants. The team used strains of color-producing Escherichia coli (E. coli) to create two classes of dyes: darker violaceins (which produced colors such as purple, blue and green) and warmer carotenoids (which produced colors such as red, orange and yellow).

Initially, the researchers genetically modified the metabolic pathway of a strain of Komagataeibacter xylinus bacteria to increase cellulose production during fermentation. Subsequently adding the violacein-producing E. coli to the reaction vessel resulted in purple-, blue- and green-dyed fabric.

However, the team was not able to use the same method to achieve the warmer tones, because the bacteria did not produce enough dye to stain the cellulose fabric, likely due to poor bacterial growth. To overcome this issue, they added pregrown and treated cellulose to a culture of carotenoid-producing E. coli. This co-culture method successfully led to red-, orange- and yellow-dyed fabrics, thereby completing the team's rainbow palette.

Overall, this method ""eliminates the need for separate dying and washing processes,"" Lee said, adding that this helps to reduce chemical waste and water consumption.

The colored bacterial cellulose showed an overall strong stability against acids, bases, heat treatments, and washing. However, the team noted that further work is needed to fully test these materials — notably, to check their durability against industrial detergents and mechanical wear and tear.

Moving forward, Lee wants to ""extend the current seven color platform to a broader spectrum"" and scale up the process to an industrial level while maintaining consistent quality. Further altering the way bacteria produce the cellulose could open up other uses of the material, such as biodegradable packaging, he said.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0aGhjNSeDuXikd5PqJg7lQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/live_science_953/63f121f608eb79eab6201fa9a30a8440,N,,2025-11-15 13:56:09.758705

Energy access and clean cooking A major push on energy access rounded out the day.","The 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on November 14 delivered one of the most consequential accelerations of the summit so far, with governments, industries, financiers and civil society converging around a shared message: the transition away from fossil fuels is underway, systemic, and increasingly irreversible. What had long been framed as ambition took shape as concrete platforms, financing mechanisms, industrial agreements and cross-sector coalitions aimed squarely at implementation.

From the launch of the Clean Energy Ministerial’s Future Fuels Action Plan to a new global transport declaration, green industrialisation commitments, and strengthened coal and oil and gas transition efforts, Day 5 offered the clearest sign yet that COP30 is attempting to turn political pledges into coordinated global action.

“Momentum has shifted,” said Dan Ioschpe, COP30 High-Level Champion. “The energy transition is no longer a niche conversation among specialists. It is a systems challenge that requires governments, private capital and industry to move in lockstep — and we are finally seeing that alignment.”

Future fuels take centre stage

The day opened with the formal launch of the Future Fuels Action Plan, the implementation backbone of the rapidly expanding Belém 4X Pledge, which aims to quadruple global sustainable fuel use by 2035. The coalition has grown from four countries at pre-COP to 23 endorsers, spanning Latin America, Africa, Asia, Europe and small island states.

The plan outlines 20 actions — from transparent carbon accounting to trade corridors — and establishes annual tracking by the International Energy Agency.

In the private sector, Maersk intensified the decarbonisation push in shipping with a major scale-up of methanol-enabled vessels. The company will operate 41 dual-fuel ships by 2027 and has signed offtake agreements for 500,000 tonnes of green methanol annually from 2026.

A second regional milestone came from Latin America, where six organisations representing farmers, biofuel producers, airlines, aviation regulators and energy institutions signed a Joint Declaration to scale Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) across the region. The agreement sets out unified fuel standards, farm-to-flight supply chains, and a regional roadmap — a move observers described as potentially transformative for a region with vast biomass and feedstock potential.

“There is enormous opportunity for this region to lead,” said Lucía Andrade, a senior official involved in the SAF coalition. “For the first time, producers and airlines are designing a market together rather than waiting for one to emerge.”

Meanwhile, the Global Environment Facility confirmed $15.8 million for UNIDO, unlocking $213.5 million in co-financing across nine countries to accelerate clean hydrogen production and use. The multilateral 10 GW Lighthouse Initiative also announced that 1 GW of electrolyser capacity has been enabled at early stages, with 68 hydrogen projects assessed for financial structuring support.

Green industrialisation breakthroughs

A second major pillar of the day was industrial decarbonisation. Ministers adopted the Belém Declaration on Global Green Industrialization, committing to scale low-carbon manufacturing, strengthen standards, and accelerate technology transfer along global supply chains.

In a landmark step, interoperability agreements among steel standards initiatives — now covering 70 per cent of global production — were finalised. Experts say this could unlock a credible global market for near-zero steel by lowering transaction costs and harmonising carbon accounting.

“This is what systemic change looks like,” said Marina Kovács, an industrial standards specialist advising the negotiations. “You cannot decarbonise steel mill by mill. You need markets that reward near-zero production, and today we built the foundations of that market.”

Transitioning away from fossil fuels: From concept to roadmap

The momentum behind transitioning away from fossil fuels — a headline outcome from Dubai’s COP28 — accelerated meaningfully.

The Powering Past Coal Alliance unveiled a Plan to Accelerate Solutions, offering technical, financial and policy support to countries preparing coal phase-out strategies. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) presented a new mechanism for a managed decline in oil and gas production, including illustrative pathways to be developed with major producing countries.

Financial signals emerged as a powerful theme. Since 2021, members of the Clean Energy Transition Partnership (CETP) have reduced international public finance for fossil fuel projects by up to 75 per cent, redirecting nearly $31 billion away from carbon-intensive systems. Over the same period, CETP members increased clean-energy finance abroad by 77 per cent.

New IMF data underscored the scale of current fossil incentives: $7.63 trillion globally, with only 9 cents of every dollar reaching the poorest quintile — a statistic that drew sharp responses throughout the plenary.

“This is not just inefficient — it is regressive,” said Mireille Diop, an economist from Senegal. “Subsidy reform is climate policy, social policy and fiscal policy rolled into one.”

The non-governmental consortium EFFECT also announced a cooperation framework for real-world pilot partnerships between fossil fuel exporting and importing countries.

Together, the initiatives showed that transitioning away is no longer an abstract aspiration but an increasingly structured process. As negotiators noted, countries are beginning to assemble the first pieces of a global roadmap built on shared learning and shared responsibility — a spirit many referred to using the Amazonian term mutirão.

Transport declaration sets a global 2035 benchmark

Transport — responsible for 23 per cent of CO2 emissions — took a major step toward alignment with 1.5°C pathways. Led by Chile, 10 countries endorsed a Declaration for a Global Transport Effort, committing to:

· 25 per cent reduction in transport energy demand by 2035

· One-third of transport energy from renewables and sustainable biofuels

Chile’s Transport Minister Juan Carlos Muñoz called it “a turning point,” adding: “We have proved that clean transport improves cities, boosts innovation and lowers pollution. The next decade is about scaling this transformation globally.”

The declaration emphasises differentiated national circumstances and highlights electromobility, sustainable biofuels, and modal shifts as complementary solutions.

Energy access and clean cooking

A major push on energy access rounded out the day. The Clean Cooking Fund has allocated $86 million in grants to 28 countries, leveraging an additional $102 million from IDA/IBRD, $10.81 million from carbon finance and $279 million from private capital. Together, the financing has supported access to clean cooking solutions for more than 37 million people and 2,772 public institutions.

A new Platform for Clean Cooking in Schools will launch tomorrow, aiming to expand programs from 10 countries to 20 by 2026, with the objective of global coverage by 2030.

Delivery, not dialogue

If earlier COP30 sessions focused on negotiations and positioning, Day 5 stood out for its emphasis on coordinated delivery — the clearest signal yet that COP30 is shaping itself as an implementation COP.

As Katie White of the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office put it: “Momentum is on our side. If we can clear the traffic ahead with this roadmap, we can — and must — accelerate.”

With system-wide actions across fuels, industry, finance, transport and energy access, Day 5 cemented COP30’s emerging identity: a summit determined not only to raise ambition, but to construct the machinery to achieve it.",https://gumlet.assettype.com/downtoearth%2F2025-11-15%2F1tklaes3%2FDay-5.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-11-15 10:57:26.829951

We were told that nothing could be done without a formal diagnosis and, once the diagnosis was provided, very little changed.

Because she masked so effectively at school, our repeated and urgent concerns, raised almost daily, about the emotional crises she experienced at home were dismissed.

We were told the issue must be at home, and that the school was already doing all it could.

Despite her diagnosis, she was not offered a place in the ASD (autism spectrum disorder) class, and we were told no further support would be provided.

We applied for a year to other schools with an ASD class and we are still on waiting lists.

She was also not accepted by the children’s disability network team, and primary care psychology services informed us that her needs were too complex for them to meet.

We also underwent an assessment of needs, which was likewise not accepted on the grounds that “the definition of disability as defined in the Act has not been met in this case”.

When her emotional wellbeing seriously deteriorated, she was referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) but her case was initially not accepted.

Only after contacting government ministers was she taken on but even then, with a nine-month waiting list.

As we could not access therapy through the public system, we attempted to go private but found that the waiting lists were either closed or years long.

After exhausting every local avenue and watching our daughter’s wellbeing decline, we made the heartbreaking decision to relocate to Spain, where her needs were recognised almost immediately.

She was granted the highest level of dependency and a disability.

She now attends a school where she has her own classroom, a dedicated teacher, and regular support from a speech and language therapist and occupational therapist.

We are grateful she is finally receiving the help she needs but the damage from years of inaction has already been done.

This is not just about the toll on our family though it has been significant.

My husband has remained working in Ireland for a year, only able to visit once a month while I have been alone with our daughter in Spain, rebuilding her life, her mental health, and education.

But, most importantly, this is about the long-term impact on a 10-year-old child.

She now faces an educational delay of approximately five years, which is extremely difficult to reverse.

She lives with the psychological impact of having spent years in a system that did not provide her with a safe or supportive environment.

She was a child with visible needs who was repeatedly overlooked, misunderstood, and effectively denied her rights, simply because she masked.

This experience has left her not only behind in her education, but with emotional wounds from being dismissed by the very structures that should have protected and supported her. And sadly, her story is not unique.

It should not take moving abroad or escalating to ministers for a child to be seen. No child should have to reach a breaking point before support is offered. And no parent should have to fight for years, every single day, for their child to receive even the most basic help.

I share this not just for my daughter, but for every other child in Ireland still waiting still unheard, still unseen, and still fighting for the support they deserve.

Is EU plan for aviation fuel just greenwashing?

John Whelan’s article — ‘EU’s €2bn plan to fix shortage of sustainable aviation fuel’, Irish Examiner, November 10 relating to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — seems a bit optimistic.

The EU will solve the problem of the shortage of SAF by spending €2bn.

This miracle SAF is defined as that made from agricultural waste or used cooking oil.

These products are already used in road transport fuels and some of these will also be in demand for the much heralded production of bio-methane from anaerobic digestion.

Thus the supply of these waste materials is not assured for the voracious needs of the aviation industry.

There are also reports that many existing biofuels in Europe are produced from imported palm oil rather than indigenous waste sources.

The only solution I have seen to produce clean aviation fuel is to use carbon capture from flue gases and to combine this with hydrogen generated from hydrolysis/wind power to produce a sustainable synthetic fuel.

This could be something like methanol but would likely cost six times the cost of the conventional fuel. Michael O’Leary has rightly scoffed at the idea of any form of SAF.

He knows that the customer does want to pay the real cost for sustainable aviation. Thus, is this EU initiative just another form of ‘greenwashing’?

Defence Forces role in President’s inauguration

For someone who, in the past, stridently declared that Ireland does not need an army, Catherine Connolly’s inauguration as Uachtarán na hÉireann would have greatly lacked a sense of solemnity, an aura of dignity, and the observance of ceremonial occasion befitting the appointment of our head of State, had the Irish Defence Forces not been present.

Irish language act may be discriminatory

I have always been a lover of the Irish language but I struggle with the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 which says that 20% of recruits to the public sector will be competent in the Irish language by the end of 2030.

That means that when you go into your nursing home and a Filipino or Indian nurse is taking care of you, you can exercise your constitutional right to have your healthcare delivered through Irish.

I find this to be really discriminatory against people when it comes to jobs.

This is akin to saying that if you can do your job through Irish, then your application goes into one pile.

That certainly doesn’t sit easy with me.

The new deliveries began in October, marking FedEx’s second and third major U.S. SAF deployments within six months. The company made its first large-scale U.S. SAF purchase at Los Angeles International Airport earlier this year.

“Each executed agreement signals to fuel producers that airlines are willing and eager collaborators to help scale the SAF market,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, Chief Sustainability Officer and Vice President of Environmental Affairs, FedEx. “The aviation industry still faces a mismatch between available SAF supply and carrier demand, but we are encouraged by early signs of increased production globally.”

At Chicago-O’Hare, FedEx will receive one million gallons of neat SAF, blended at a minimum 30% ratio, supplied by Air bp. The company is now the first U.S. all-cargo airline to purchase and use SAF at the airport.

“Existing fuel infrastructure and supportive state policies made sourcing SAF at O’Hare a logical next step in our alternative fuel strategy,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, Chief Sustainability Officer and Vice President of Environmental Affairs, FedEx.

In Miami, FedEx has begun receiving about three million gallons of blended SAF at a 30% minimum blend from AEG Fuels.

“With FedEx flights from Miami heading all over Latin America and the Caribbean every day, we are proud to see our Miami hub leading the way in sustainable fuel adoption,” said Luiz R. Vasconcelos, President, FedEx Latin America and the Caribbean. “This milestone reinforces our commitment and shows our customers that sustainability is not just a corporate goal—it’s a regional priority.”

FedEx said the expansion supports its goal of carbon-neutral operations by 2040, alongside ongoing investments in cleaner aircraft, electric vehicles, and renewable energy.

The Long-Term Vision For Hydrogen So, could Rolls-Royce’s hydrogen engine concept redefine jet power?","The aviation industry stands at a critical juncture, facing immense pressure to decarbonize by 2050. While Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) offers an immediate ""drop-in"" solution, its long-term scalability and total emissions reduction potential remain subjects of debate.

Enter hydrogen, a fuel source with the potential for true zero-carbon emissions at the point of use. British engine maker Rolls-Royce, in partnership with airline easyJet and various research institutions, has embarked on a pioneering journey to develop and test hydrogen-powered gas turbine engines. But could today's hydrogen engine concept tests truly redefine the future of jet power?

The Rationale Behind Hydrogen Power

Testing of hydrogen for jet engines began as early as the mid-1950s by the US National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), a precursor to NASA. Ground tests of a liquid hydrogen fuel system with a modified J65 engine were conducted at NACA's Lewis Field laboratories in 1955. This led to the world's first experimental flights of a hydrogen-powered aircraft, a modified Martin B-57 Canberra bomber, in early 1957.

Back then, interest in hydrogen-powered flight was primarily focused on performance. But hydrogen’s appeal today lies in its clean-burning properties, producing only water vapor as a byproduct. Specifically, the environmental advantages of hydrogen as a jet fuel are:

Zero CO₂ Emissions: When hydrogen is burned in a jet engine, the only direct byproduct is water vapor. This eliminates carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, a major contributor to global warming, making it an attractive solution for decarbonizing the aviation industry, especially if the hydrogen is produced using renewable energy (""green hydrogen"").

Reduced Other Pollutants: Hydrogen combustion produces up to 90% less nitrogen oxides than conventional jet fuel and eliminates the formation of particulate matter, improving local air quality around airports.

Potential to Reduce Climate Impact: While water vapor creates contrails, studies suggest that hydrogen combustion could lead to a 30–50% reduction in overall climate impact compared to kerosene aircraft, a figure that could reach 75–90% with fuel cell technology.

Hydrogen also has significant operational advantages. It possesses nearly three times the energy per kilogram as kerosene, so less fuel by weight is needed to achieve the same amount of energy. Theoretically, it can be generated anywhere there is water and electricity, reducing the reliance on complex oil extraction and refinement supply chains and potentially allowing airports to produce their own fuel. Thinking even more broadly, using liquid hydrogen's cryogenic properties as a heat sink could also open up new design possibilities for improved engine and system performance.

A Landmark Ground Test

All that theory started being put into practice on November 28, 2022. At an outdoor test facility at Boscombe Down in the UK, engineers from Rolls-Royce and easyJet gathered to run a converted Rolls-Royce AE 2100-A test engine on 100% green hydrogen. Years of research and development had led to that day, and the hydrogen produced using renewable wind and tidal power by the European Marine Energy Center (EMEC) in the Orkney Islands, was ready. When the day was out, the partners had set a new aviation milestone with the world’s first run of a modern aero engine on hydrogen.

This initial test was more of a proof of concept than a test of the actual power of the engine. It demonstrated that a modern turboprop engine could combust hydrogen without immediately encountering show-stopping issues. The engine technology itself remained largely the same, a crucial point for future certification and integration, but the fuel system was radically altered to handle the unique properties of hydrogen. The success of this ground test injected a new wave of optimism into the sector, showing that the zero-carbon potential of hydrogen was an achievable goal, not just a theoretical aspiration.

Overcoming The Thermal Challenge

Following the initial low-power test, the engineers moved to tackle a more significant hurdle: achieving maximum takeoff thrust. This is where hydrogen's properties pose their greatest challenge. Hydrogen burns far hotter and more rapidly than traditional kerosene, making flame control a significant engineering feat.

The team, collaborating with the German aerospace research agency DLR and Loughborough University, focused their efforts on redesigning the fuel spray nozzles within the combustor of a Rolls-Royce Pearl 700 engine, the exclusive engine for the Gulfstream G700 and G800. The result was a novel system that progressively mixes air with the hydrogen to manage its high reactivity and control the flame position. The tests, conducted at DLR's facilities in Cologne, proved that hydrogen could indeed be combusted at conditions representing maximum takeoff thrust.

The results were precisely in line with expectations, confirming the viability of Rolls-Royce's advanced fuel system design. Grazia Vittadini, former Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Airbus and now the CTO at Rolls-Royce, had the following to say:

""This is an incredible achievement in a short space of time. Controlling the combustion process is one of the key technology challenges the industry faces in making hydrogen a real aviation fuel of the future. We have achieved that, and it makes us eager to keep moving forward.""

This milestone was crucial because it went beyond the initial proof of concept. Via intermediate and full pressure testing, it addressed a major technical unknown in hydrogen combustion, proving that it could be used in real-world conditions. In doing so, it moved the conversation from ""if"" hydrogen could power an engine to ""how"" it could be safely and efficiently integrated into existing engine architectures.

Major Infrastructure Hurdles Remain

The engineering breakthroughs in the lab were significant, but the path to commercial aviation involves more than just engine technology. A massive obstacle looms large: the lack of infrastructure. For hydrogen to be a viable aviation fuel, a global ecosystem for its production, storage, and distribution at airports needs to be built from scratch.

The current production of ""green"" hydrogen—created using renewable energy sources like wind and tidal power—is minimal and expensive. Most hydrogen produced today relies on fossil fuels, which negates the carbon-neutral benefit. Rolls-Royce is actively advocating for government support and cross-industry collaboration to scale up production and drive down costs, but the investment required is substantial, representing many billions of dollars.

Airports and energy companies are hesitant to invest such sums without guaranteed demand, creating a classic ""chicken and egg"" scenario. As a result, Rolls-Royce and partners like easyJet are working with airports, such as AGS Airports (Aberdeen, Glasgow, Southampton), to plan for on-site hydrogen generation and storage, a crucial step in preparing for zero-emission flights. The success of this concept is intrinsically linked to overcoming this monumental infrastructure hurdle.

A Redesigned Future For Aircraft

The challenges aren't limited to the ground or the engine itself. Aircraft running on liquid hydrogen will require fundamental design changes. Hydrogen, even in liquid form, has a much lower energy density by volume than kerosene. This means operators would have to sacrifice either passenger capacity or range to accommodate the bulky, insulated cryogenic fuel tanks needed to store hydrogen at -253°C.

The consensus in the industry is that hydrogen will likely be limited to smaller, shorter-haul segments initially. Rolls-Royce is targeting small to mid-sized aircraft (30–40 seats) from the mid-2030s. This focus on regional aviation makes sense, as shorter flights require less fuel, making the volume/weight trade-off more manageable. While radical aircraft redesigns are necessary, the path is clearer for smaller platforms, allowing the technology to mature before potentially scaling up.

The Long-Term Vision For Hydrogen

So, could Rolls-Royce’s hydrogen engine concept redefine jet power? The answer is nuanced. The current consensus within Rolls-Royce and the broader industry is that while hydrogen has immense potential, especially for zero-emission flight at the point of use, it will likely start as a complement to other solutions like SAFs, rather than an immediate replacement for all aviation.

SAFs remain the only viable option for decarbonizing existing long-haul fleets in the near to medium term. Hydrogen's role is expected to blossom first in the regional and short-haul sectors. The technology needs years of rigorous development and certification, with commercial availability likely only by the mid-2030s for smaller planes.

However, the groundbreaking tests have fundamentally altered the landscape, proving the viability of hydrogen combustion in a modern engine. By pushing the boundaries of engineering and design, Rolls-Royce has demonstrated that a future of zero-carbon aviation is possible, even if it requires a radical rethink of aircraft design and global infrastructure. As such, the redefinition of jet power will be a phased evolution, led by the pioneering work of companies willing to take a leap into the cryogenic future of flight.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a-new-generation-could-rolls-royce-s-hydrogen-engine-concept-redefine-jet-power.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-15 10:58:37.459796

A Texas refinery that supplies green fuel to U.S. airlines has been purchasing animal fat from cattle raised on illegally cleared lands in the Amazon rainforest, according to a Reuters review of government tracking data, interviews and eyewitness accounts.

Louisiana-based Diamond Green Diesel, a joint-venture between biofuels producer Darling Ingredients and petroleum refiner Valero Energy, has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into a refinery in Port Arthur, Texas that turns cattle fat – called tallow – into a cleaner alternative to petroleum-based jet fuel and diesel.

Diamond Green Diesel is a major player in the U.S. sustainable fuels market. It has collected over $3 billion in U.S. tax credits for producing biofuels since 2022, according to filings.

But interviews and documents show at least two Brazilian factories that supplied Diamond Green Diesel with tens of thousands of tons of cattle fat since 2023 are sourcing some of it from slaughterhouses that have bought animals from illegally deforested ranches in the Amazon rainforest.

Carriers such as JetBlue JBLU.O and Southwest Airlines LUV.N, which struck deals with Valero to use the “green” jet fuel, can claim credit for lowering their emissions because Diamond Green Diesel’s plant is certified under a United Nations agreement curbing the impact of aviation on the climate called CORSIA.

The global market for sustainable jet fuel is small, about $2.9 billion in 2025 according to analysis firm SkyQuest Technology Group, compared to the $239 billion global market for conventional aviation fuel. But government incentives are expected to help the market grow exponentially, pumping more resources into the Brazilian cattle industry, the leading driver of the destruction of the Amazon rainforest.

Pedro Piris-Cabezas, an economist at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said any additional demand “could result in the expansion of herds and directly or indirectly drive deforestation and forest degradation.”

It could also violate Brazilian law. “Companies that profit from raw materials originating from a supply chain that involves deforestation, are also responsible for these illegalities,” said Ricardo Negrini, a Brazilian federal prosecutor who has opened a number of government investigations into the cattle industry.

Diamond Green Diesel, Darling Ingredients, Valero Energy, Southwest and JetBlue did not reply to multiple requests for comment, including detailed questions about the Brazilian tallow supply chain.

To track the tallow trade from illegally deforested ranches in the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, Reuters partnered with the nonprofit investigative outlet Reporter Brasil, which helped review court documents that link slaughterhouses to the tallow plants, corporate filings, trade data, and government cattle tracking records.

Reuters also interviewed over a dozen people involved in each step of the beef tallow supply chain, including traders, truck drivers, prosecutors, auditors and regulators.

Diamond Green Diesel sources tallow from multiple countries, and Reuters was unable to determine how much of it came from ranches in illegally-cleared land in the Amazon.

TAINTED CATTLE

In 2022 Darling Ingredients CEO Randall Stuewe announced the $557 million acquisition of several plants in Brazil, including four in the Amazon region, that would supply “waste fats to be used in the production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel,” according to a statement issued at the time.

Reuters found one of those rendering plants in Para state, called Araguaia, sourced cattle fat from at least five meatpackers that failed a May 2025 audit conducted by federal prosecutors for slaughtering 20,000 cattle from illegally deforested areas.

In 2023, Araguaia exported $4.4 million worth of beef tallow from the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, according to trade data from Import Genius.

In June, a Reuters journalist saw a truck with an Araguaia logo inside the Sao Francisco slaughterhouse, which failed an audit for buying cattle from farms on illegally deforested land.

The driver of the truck, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters he had been picking up carcasses at the Sao Francisco slaughterhouse and delivering them to the Araguaia plant for two years. Two other drivers and two Sao Francisco employees confirmed the slaughterhouse was an Araguaia supplier.

Sao Francisco didn’t confirm or deny that it is a supplier of the Araguaia plant. It said it has been cooperating with federal prosecutors since 2018 and that it hired an outside firm to monitor its supply chain.

Sao Francisco sources some of its cattle indirectly from Vale do Paraiso, a farm that had been blocked from grazing cattle since 2006 because 15 square miles of trees had been illegally razed, according to Brazil’s environmental protection agency, Ibama. Cattle tracking data shows that the cattle was moved from Vale do Paraiso to a farm with a clean record before it reached the slaughterhouse.

The agency said it lifted a commercial ban on Vale do Paraiso last year because its owner Antonio Lucena Barros presented a plan to restore the deforested area. Barros also obtained a court injunction suspending a fine of over $3 million, which the agency said it will appeal.

Barros’ lawyer Calebe Rocha said in a statement that his client is fighting the fines in court and has been granted an injunction that suspends the payment of the fine. He also said that no animals were sold from the part of Vale do Paraiso that Ibama had blocked due to deforestation.

Another plant owned by Darling Ingredients sourced fat from a slaughterhouse that confirmed to Reuters that it bought hundreds of cattle in 2022 and 2023 from rancher Bruno Heller, who Brazil’s Federal Police has described as possibly the Amazon’s biggest deforester in a 2023 investigation.

In a statement, Heller’s lawyer Vinicius Segatto said Brazil’s environmental law is “excessively rigorous” and that the criminal case against his client is ongoing.

FAT TO FUEL

Airlines have been under pressure to buy more green jet fuel, which is now produced in tiny quantities, to meet industry targets of net zero emissions by 2050.

Supporters of the use of tallow as a biofuel assert that demand for it alone is unlikely to push ranchers to clear rainforest to grow their pastures because of its economic value – less than 3% of what slaughterhouses get for each animal.

Diamonds’ imports from Brazil were certified as sustainable by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), a third-party certification body that approved Diamond’s plant for CORSIA.

To be eligible, biomass used for fuel cannot come from land that was deforested after 2008 or protected areas, but the ISCC told Reuters it did not investigate Diamond’s supply chain because it considers tallow a “byproduct” of the beef industry under CORSIA.

Three experts who helped design CORSIA told Reuters that the program allows producers to omit the score for carbon emissions and deforestation of the Amazon rainforest because it assumes demand for tallow is unlikely to push ranchers to grow their herds.

The International Civil Aviation Organization declined to comment when asked about whether it viewed deforestation in the tallow supply chain as a violation of its sustainability standards.

However, the agency said it is “constantly monitoring the compliance” of third-parties responsible for certifying sustainable aviation fuel producers and welcomes information on “any potential deviations” for further evaluation.

I just recently took a trip to Iceland, and then tagged on a fun review trip from there. Now I’m heading back out on the road (or in the skies, I guess!). So you can expect some live updates, and then upon returning home, I’ll publish the full review series from all of these trips.

Given the upcoming holidays, I feel like this is the second to last trip of the year that I’ll manage to squeeze in (with one more between Thanksgiving and Christmas). Let me explain what I have booked so far, in chronological order.

I’m first flying PorterReserve on the Embraer E195-E2

I’m kicking off the trip with a product I’ve been curious about for some time. Canada’s Porter Airlines has massively expanded in recent years, including operating Embraer E195-E2s on transborder flights. So I’m starting the trip by flying PorterReserve, the carrier’s premium product, from Fort Lauderdale (FLL) to Montreal (YUL).

This is the carrier’s premium product, and think of it as basically being an extra legroom seating option with improved service (even though Porter has very high service standards already). I can’t wait to give the airline a try, as I last flew with Porter when it was an all-turboprop operator.

By the way, this is such a spectacular use of Alaska Atmos Rewards points — we’re talking just 10,000 points for a one-way premium cabin ticket!

Then I’m flying Air France’s Boeing 787-9 business class

From Montreal, I’ll by flying Air France’s Boeing 787-9 business class to Paris (CDG). Okay, I’ve flown Air France business class many times before (on the Airbus A350-900, Boeing 777-300ER, etc.), so why am I flying the airline again? Well, several reasons.

For one, I haven’t flown the Air France Dreamliner in many years, so I think it’s time to see how that product is holding up, since it’s a different seat than on Air France’s other planes. Second, I’m curious to check out Air France’s new business class bedding, which was recently rolled out. Third, it gets me where I need to go, with interesting segments on both ends. Fourth, there was actually saver award availability!

Lastly (and perhaps most importantly, at least to me), I have Flying Blue Platinum status, and my status qualification period ends in a couple of weeks, and I’m a small number of XPs short of requlaifying for status. So by purchasing sustainable aviation fuel for the flight, I’ll get the XPs required to get me over the edge, and to keep the status.

Next I’m flying Aircalin’s Airbus A330-900neo business class

Okay, here’s a really fun one. From Paris, I’ll be flying Aircalin’s Airbus A330-900neo business class to Bangkok (BKK). How fun is that?! For those not familiar, Aircalin is the airline of New Caledonia, and the airline has greatly adjusted its route network in recent times, now flying between Paris and Noumea with a stop in Bangkok.

So I’m taking the first segment of the journey, which I managed to book in business class with Flying Blue miles. I’ve been wanting to fly Aircalin for so long, so I can’t wait to finally check this out!!

I’m returning in Thai Airways’ Boeing 787-9 business class

From Bangkok, I’ll make my way back to the United States, but via Europe. I’ll be flying Thai Airways’ Boeing 787-9 business class to Milan (MXP), as that’s the only European route operated by that specific plane, which has what I’d argue is Thai’s best business class product.

I haven’t flown Thai’s long haul business class in a long time, and I managed to book this as part of a larger itinerary, where I’m paying just 87,500 Air Canada Aeroplan points to fly from Asia to the United States via Europe. You can’t beat that value, eh?! These redemptions used to be so common for me back in the day, but with how award availability has evolved, it’s tougher than in the past, so this got me downright giddy.

I’m finishing with SWISS’ Airbus A350-900 business class

For the final portion of my trip, I’ll be flying SWISS’ brand new Airbus A350-900 business class from Zurich (ZRH) to Boston (BOS). This plane recently entered commercial service, and I’m looking forward to being among the first people to experience this on a long haul flight. It features the new SWISS Senses experience, based on the Lufthansa Allegris concept.

Quite honestly, this segment is what motivated the entire trip. When I saw award availability on this sector, I figured “okay, I have to review this.” And then I worked backwards. “Well, if I’m redeeming Aeroplan points from Europe to the United States, I might as well originate in Asia, since it’s a better value.” And that’s how the whole trip planning started.

The hotels I’m staying at on this trip

I do have a few hotel stays on this trip, so what do I have planned? Truth be told, I have so many of these Amex Platinum $300 hotel credits to burn through, which are ideal for one night stays, so I’m more focused on luxury properties than anything, given the good value available on short stays:

In Montreal, I’ll be spending a night at the Four Seasons, which I’ve heard great things about, and which is regarded as the best hotel in the city

In Paris, I actually potentially have a couple of nights (but maybe not — more on that in a separate post); should I review the Park Hyatt again, check out Hyatt’s Hotel du Louvre, stay at Hilton LXR’s SAX Paris, or check out one of Marriott’s Luxury Collection options (Hotel de Berri or Prince de Galles)?

In Bangkok, I’m leaning toward staying at the Ritz-Carlton, though I’m open to other ideas for points properties (I’ve reviewed the Park Hyatt and Waldorf Astoria in the past); I’d like to return to Bangkok again soon for a proper visit, so I’m saving the Aman, Capella, and Four Seasons, for when I go with Ford

Bottom line

I just planned another review trip, where I’ll be flying a variety of products that have been on my list. I’ll be experiencing Porter’s E195-E2 PorterReserve, Air France’s 787-9 business class, Aircalin’s A330-900neo business class, Thai Airways’ 787-9 business class, and SWISS’ A350-900 business class.

The aim of the bill is to utilise strategies to meet the supply demand with SAF mandate of 2% blending in 2025 to 22% by 2040. Therefore, the mandate creates demand for SAF but the struggle for supply continues.

Proposed strategies to meet the mandate

On Jan. 1, 2025, the government imposed a SAF mandate on the aviation industry to blend a minimum and increasing percentage of SAF into the total fuel mix for flights departing the UK. The rise is targeted from 2% in 2025 to 22% in 2040.

To meet these targets and support the commercial production of SAF in the UK, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill was introduced on May 14, 2025 in the House of Commons.

One of the main targets of the bill is to introduce a Revenue Certainty Mechanism. The Secretary of State may instruct a government-owned counterparty to enter contracts with SAF producers while reducing investment risks. A fixed “strike price” for SAF will be guaranteed over a defined period.

If the market price falls below the strike price, the counterparty pays the producer the difference.

If the market price exceeds the strike price, the producer pays the counterparty the surplus.

Such resolutions will ensure that the mechanism mirrors the UK’s Contracts for Difference (CfD) scheme used in low-carbon electricity and hydrogen. It will also aim to lower financing costs, boost investor confidence, and accelerate final investment decisions for SAF plants.

The bill also specifies the counterparty which must be a company wholly owned by the government. This is to ensure responsibility for issuing and managing contracts with SAF producers, handling payments under the strike price mechanism, and administering the overall scheme.

Were certain targets missed?

During the Report stage of the bill, on Oct. 15, 2025, Olly Glover, Liberal Democrat Spokesperson (Transport), introduced new clauses and at the same time highlighted a few missed targets,

In 2010, Boeing announced the target that 1% of aviation fuel globally should come from SAF by 2015, and in 2019, the International Air Transport Association set out hopes of reaching 2% by 2025, but today, globally, the figure is just 0.3%.

He observes the continued talks of using SAF over the years yet notices a poor track record of unambitious targets. He says,

The Conservative Government promised back in 2022 to have five commercial UK SAF plants operational by 2025, but there is still only one. It is therefore right of the Government to have introduced legislation to make sure that the latest set of SAF targets move from fantasy to realistic, credible and deliverable plans.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/l_bailey_of_paddington_hol070325-71.jpg.webp,N,,2025-11-15 10:59:12.266134

Global airlines are bracing for another cost squeeze as the industry warns that tariff-linked price hikes by aircraft and engine suppliers could derail the fragile recovery in aviation manufacturing.
“Tariffs will impact the nascent recovery of the supply chain and also increase non-fuel cost for the airlines,” he said.
He pointed out that while aircraft and engines are exempt, many of the raw materials and components sourced globally are not.
“Supply chain recovery is now undermined by tariffs which increase supplier costs.","Synopsis

Speaking at the 69th Assembly of Presidents of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) here, IATA Director General Willie Walsh said there was huge frustration that the supply chain issues are not getting much better. While airlines are a low margin industry, he said the margins of OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) are high.

Global airlines are bracing for another cost squeeze as the industry warns that tariff-linked price hikes by aircraft and engine suppliers could derail the fragile recovery in aviation manufacturing. IATA Director General Willie Walsh on Saturday said supply-chain disruptions continue to delay aircraft deliveries and increase operating costs — and expressed concern that some OEMs are now talking about raising prices.

Speaking at the 69th Assembly of Presidents of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA), Walsh said “there was huge frustration that the supply chain issues are not getting much better,” even as airlines continue to operate with thin margins. In contrast, he noted that OEMs enjoy much stronger profitability.

Taking examples, he said engine makers “are actually improving their financial performance during a period of massive disruption which has added massive costs to the airline industry.”

Walsh added that “it is bothering when he hears suppliers talking about that they want to increase prices because of tariffs and other supply chain issues.”

“There's got to be a correction to this. Airlines need to be properly rewarded. I don't object to anybody making profits....

Live Events

But we've got to see a greater balance and we need to see these critical suppliers raising their game and raising their game significantly to ensure that they're serving the industry in the way that we need to be served,” he said.

The global aviation sector continues to struggle with prolonged supply-chain bottlenecks since the pandemic, leaving airlines waiting for new aircraft even as passenger demand rebounds sharply. The worldwide commercial aircraft backlog exceeded 17,000 units last year — significantly higher than the 2010–2019 annual average of 13,000 — according to an IATA–Oliver Wyman study.

AAPA Director General Subhas Menon warned that tariffs now threaten to slow the already fragile recovery. “Tariffs will impact the nascent recovery of the supply chain and also increase non-fuel cost for the airlines,” he said.

He pointed out that while aircraft and engines are exempt, many of the raw materials and components sourced globally are not. “Supply chain recovery is now undermined by tariffs which increase supplier costs. While aircraft and engines are exempt, their raw materials, and components which come from many parts of the world, are not.

“Tariffs also affect demand through inflation. It is a double whammy as both supply, and demand sides of the market are affected,” Menon said, even as he reiterated that air transport demand remains strong.

On sustainability, Menon said that taxing airlines “directly or indirectly through mandates has not worked” and noted that Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production remains low.

The IATA–Oliver Wyman study estimates that supply-chain challenges will cost airlines more than USD 11 billion in 2025, driven by excess fuel burn, additional maintenance, increased engine leasing and higher inventory-holding expenses.

,,2025-11-15 07:10:18+00:00,The Brighter Side of News,Scientists convert household trash into jet fuel — cutting aviation emissions by up to 90%,"Joseph Shavit, Mac Oliveau",,,,,https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-convert-household-trash-into-jet-fuel-cutting-aviation-emissions-by-up-to-90/,"Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is already compatible with the jet fuel formulated today and in use across the globe, and it could reduce aviation emissions by over 65 percent through mid-century.
Converting this waste into jet fuel could help cities handle rising trash while giving airlines a cleaner energy supply.
In that scenario, we would have reduced the global amount of aviation emissions by about 16 percent in 2019.
The United States anticipates getting to 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) per year by 2030, and 35 billion gallons a year by 2050.
""Turning everyday waste into jet fuel could be an innovative but significant near-term step toward cleaner aviation,"" Zhang argues.","A walk through any busy airport makes it clear that flying remains a central part of modern life. Yet every plane that lifts off depends on fuel that adds to a warming climate. Aviation is responsible for roughly 2.5 percent of the world’s carbon emissions, and demand for air travel is expected to keep rising.

Unlike cars or buses, long flights cannot easily switch to batteries or hydrogen because they need far more energy. That reality has pushed scientists and policymakers to search for fuels that can power jets without heating the planet.

One possible option is gaining traction. Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is already compatible with the jet fuel formulated today and in use across the globe, and it could reduce aviation emissions by over 65 percent through mid-century. However, SAF currently accounts for less than 1 percent of global jet fuel use due to high costs, tight supplies, and limited experience.

A recent article published in Nature Sustainability highlights an unexpected way forward. The researchers investigated a new source of low-carbon jet fuel, not from crops, cooking oil, or forestry waste, but from everyday municipal solid waste. The results provided a potential pathway to reducing waste and emissions that also alleviates the pressure on landfills.

Waste to Winged Flight

Municipal solid waste is the mix of food scraps, paper, plastics, metals, and other materials found in trash cans and on the curb each week (see image below). The considerable accumulation of waste is diverted to landfills nearing saturation or incinerators that must undergo costly pollution reduction procedures. Converting this waste into jet fuel could help cities handle rising trash while giving airlines a cleaner energy supply.

Researchers from Tsinghua University and the Harvard-China Program utilized real operational data from a commercial gasification facility and Fischer-Tropsch operation facility to further evaluate this concept at the industrial scale. Their study analyzed each part of the process from the waste collection point to the loading of the finished fuel product into the aircraft.

Trash is first sorted, crushed, dried, and shaped into pellets that combust more evenly. Gasification, gas cleaning, and reactor processes convert feedstock pellets into liquid hydrocarbons, which have been upgraded through further refining in order to meet jet fuel specifications.

With the full life-cycle evaluation, the biogenic fraction of municipal solid waste generated an intensity of emissions of 14.1 grams CO2 equivalent per MJ of fuel energy produced. Conventional jet fuel has an intensity of emissions in the range of 89 grams CO2 equivalent per MJ of fuel energy produced, indicative of at least an 84% emissions reduction that could be realized via waste-derived sustainable aviation fuel when all systems are operating properly.

Where Emissions Are Added or Reduced

Not all aspects of the system are the same. The most carbon-intensive step is the gas cleaning process, due in part to the water gas shift reaction that consumes carbon monoxide (CO) and produces CO2 as a product that is released (and not captured or used). Additionally, the drying process of shredding waste adds a large energy burden to the total emissions reduction assessment, as much of the waste in many countries has a high amount of moisture.

The most uncertain aspect of the overall gasification process is gasification performance. Municipal waste may contain varied sizes, moisture, or composition, making it difficult to gasify consistently. When the hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide ratio drifts far from the preferred amounts for reactors, additional energy is needed to maintain the fuel output. Even modestly reducing the effective gas composition can result in life cycle emissions increasing by more than half and the amount of fuel yield being reduced by nearly one-third.

The energy source also matters. Running the system on clean power can reduce carbon emissions by more than 75 percent. The waste composition plays an additional role. Plastics can support improved gasification by increasing the overall heating value, but as a fossil-based material, they can nearly double life cycle emissions if not carefully managed.

Improvements can take place through sorting or shifting to lower-energy drying processes, like biodrying, to reduce the environmental impact of gasification. Such improvements are most beneficial when food waste makes up a large portion of the trash stream, making heating for drying more energy-intensive.

Closing the Carbon Loop

Even gasification, with very low carbon emissions, operates at only about 1/3 of the carbon in the waste to fuel output conversion. This is the case because the fuel gas coming from the waste does not match the preferred reactant or gas mixture the reactor wants.

Researchers looked at two alternatives. In one example, nearly pure carbon dioxide is extracted from the gasifier during the cleaning process. This carbon dioxide can be stored underground, resulting in a net negative carbon intensity for the system runs. However, this means that some of the carbon that could become fuel is locked below ground.

The carbon dioxide can also be reacted with “green” hydrogen as a way to produce fuel. This method, referred to as a power-to-liquid route, has the potential to elevate carbon conversion efficiencies above 60 percent; however, it requires substantial use of renewable hydrogen and energy.

An alternative method can also add renewable hydrogen directly into the gas mix rather than converting the carbon monoxide. This has already had preliminary trials in industrial processes. This process increases the carbon conversion amount by 1.5 times the amount of emissions, reducing the emissions to around 7 grams per megajoule.

Emissions could also potentially go down below 4 grams per megajoule with an excellent gasification process and lower energy drying methods. For example, with one ton of municipal waste, this could displace over 170 kg of carbon dioxide while using a fraction of the hydrogen required by the power-to-liquid processes.

Global Scale and Policy Momentum

Researchers have mapped the potential production of jet fuel from municipal waste worldwide under different assumptions. Under one scenario, reflecting current practices, the potential was up to 50 million tons of fuel per year. In that scenario, we would have reduced the global amount of aviation emissions by about 16 percent in 2019.

If you add renewable hydrogen to the conversion, the potential jet fuel is estimated to be 80 million tons per year, which would satisfy greater than 25 percent of the global demand for jet fuel and reduce annual emissions by way of avoiding around 270 million tons of carbon dioxide.

Different geographic regions are more suited than others. China is estimated to produce over 11 million tons of waste-derived SAF, representing the potential for roughly 30 percent of its jet fuel. The European Union, the United States, and India are anticipated to contribute around 5 million tons each. In those regions where food- and feed-based fuels are banned, such as Europe, some type of waste-derived fuel is likely to be necessary in order to meet long-term fuel blending regulations.

Governments are providing impetus to this industry now. The United States anticipates getting to 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) per year by 2030, and 35 billion gallons a year by 2050. European regulations require increasing SAF fractions to be implemented on all flights leaving EU airports starting at 2 percent next year. And, under the International Civil Aviation Organization framework, airlines are expected to offset growth in emissions, making waste-based SAF increasingly financially attractive as carbon prices increase.

Can Airlines Afford Waste-Derived Fuel?

Costs are still a factor. Initial commercial plants may produce waste-derived SAF at 0.89 to 1.70 dollars per liter. If plants ramp up production and improve technology, these costs may fall to between 0.60 and 1.08 dollars per liter. This is still above fossil jet fuel and almost consistent with current SAF prices for sale in today’s market.

The bulk of costs will be capital outlay. Gasification and Fischer-Tropsch units spend the most money for the total implementation. Any pretreatment adds to operating costs and significant investments as well. Even small charges for the waste itself could raise fuel prices quite a lot.

In the end, though, waste-derived SAF starts to become a better deal versus purchasing offsets under CORSIA prices around the year 2030. A more salient switch occurs in countries where offset prices rise quickly or public subsidies decrease the price of SAF production. In China, using waste-derived SAF instead of offsets from 2027 to 2035 could save over 2 billion dollars, and in the United States, the savings would be around 1 billion dollars. In high offset price scenarios, savings are even larger.

A New Way of Thinking About Flight

Flying will persist as part of everyday life, but the way the world powers those flights is beginning to change. While waste-derived SAF will never mitigate the entire climate impact of aviation, the thought that household garbage could help fuel global travel hints (at the very least) at a surprising new addition to both waste management and clean energy.

The sentiments of the study from Tsinghua University and Harvard University note that this pathway could significantly mitigate emissions through their findings, as long as the technology improves and policy persists and solidifies.

Jingran Zhang, the first author of the study, argues that the switch could occur quickly in time. ""Turning everyday waste into jet fuel could be an innovative but significant near-term step toward cleaner aviation,"" Zhang argues. Michael B. McElroy, a senior researcher at Harvard and co-author, stated that broad cooperation across government, airlines, and manufacturers would be required to make this efficient on a larger scale.

The plane that carries you across the world one day could, in part, run on the waste you left at the curb. At first thought, the idea is surprising, but the associated science suggests it could make a significant difference if the world chooses to invest in it.

Research findings are available online in the journal Nature Sustainability.
