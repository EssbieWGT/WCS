Managing Director (Current Charge), Dhaka Bank

The Daily Star (TDS): How would you evaluate the current state of sustainable banking in Bangladesh?

A K M Shahnawaj (AKMS): Sustainable banking in Bangladesh has made remarkable strides in recent years, transitioning from a niche concept to a core strategic priority within the financial sector. The pivotal role of Bangladesh Bank — through its sustainable and green finance guidelines, refinancing facilities for renewable energy and energy-efficient projects, and mandatory sustainability reporting — has been instrumental in accelerating this growth. At Dhaka Bank, we have wholeheartedly embraced these initiatives, embedding environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations deeply into our lending and investment decisions.

While sustainable finance currently represents a growing segment of the credit market, the foundation is firmly in place for rapid expansion. With increasing awareness, advancing technical capacity, and evolving transition finance, we are confident that Bangladesh is well positioned to scale sustainable finance significantly to meet its climate and sustainable development goals. The progress so far inspires optimism for a green and resilient future.

TDS: What sustainable financing/refinancing schemes does your bank offer, particularly for SMEs, women entrepreneurs, or other environmentally responsible enterprises?

AKMS: Dhaka Bank is deeply committed to promoting sustainable finance and actively participates in Bangladesh Bank's refinancing initiatives targeting renewable energy, particularly solar power, energy-efficient machinery, waste management, effluent treatment, and eco-friendly industrial projects. For sectors such as Ready-Made Garments and large-scale manufacturing, we leverage programmes including the Refinance for Environment-Friendly Green Projects, the Technology Development Fund, and the Green Transformation Fund to facilitate the adoption of energy-efficient technologies.

For SMEs, we provide access to government and central bank refinance schemes, including the Tk. 25,000 crore CMSME programme at 7% interest, the agro-processing refinance facility, and the SME Foundation's revolving fund at 6%. Additionally, our Start-up Fund offers young entrepreneurs concessional loans of up to Tk. 80 million at just 4% interest.

We also provide targeted financing for businesses in rural areas, marginal traders, and women entrepreneurs, with concessional rates as low as 5%, including our Oditiya Loan designed specifically for women entrepreneurs.

Through these efforts, Dhaka Bank aims to promote inclusive growth and contribute to Bangladesh's sustainable development.

TDS: What initiatives has your bank undertaken to promote sustainable banking, and what measures have you implemented to reduce your own carbon footprint?

AKMS: At Dhaka Bank, sustainability is deeply ingrained in both our operational framework and corporate culture. We have dedicated Sustainable Finance Help Desks in every branch to integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risk assessments into our credit appraisal processes through the Environmental and Social Due Diligence (ESDD) matrix.

Furthermore, training and awareness programmes are conducted to cultivate sustainability-mindedness among employees, ensuring accountability and engagement throughout the organisation.

Internally, we have implemented several initiatives to reduce our carbon footprint. These include digitising workflows — for example, adopting a ""go green"" approach for bill collection — to significantly lower paper consumption, and upgrading to energy-efficient lighting across our branch network.

Moreover, Dhaka Bank has recently partnered with the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) to enhance our capacity for measuring and managing financed emissions. This collaboration underscores our commitment to transparency and accountability in assessing the environmental impact of our loan and investment portfolios, positioning us among the pioneers in Bangladesh to adopt globally recognised carbon accounting standards.

TDS: What challenges has your bank encountered in adopting and promoting sustainable banking practices?

AKMS: We face several challenges. Many borrowers lack the technical capacity to develop green projects and often perceive sustainable technologies as costly with delayed returns. The absence of standardised ESG data complicates impact assessment and risk evaluation. Although Bangladesh Bank's refinancing schemes are beneficial, the local market for green bonds and sustainability-linked loans is still emerging, limiting financing avenues for large-scale initiatives. Moreover, cultivating a sustainability mindset among clients and staff requires sustained education and incentives.

TDS: What are your bank's future plans to advance sustainable banking, and what support do you seek from the government?

AKMS: Our strategy focuses on three key pillars: scaling, innovation, and partnership. We plan to increase our green financing portfolio substantially, focusing on renewable energy generation, climate-resilient infrastructure, sustainable agriculture, and energy-efficient industrial modernisation.

We intend to introduce innovative financing instruments such as sustainability-linked loans, where borrowers receive better terms for meeting ESG targets, and explore partnerships with international climate funds to secure concessional financing for Bangladesh's green transition.

In terms of government support, fiscal incentives such as tax breaks for green investments, import duty exemptions on eco-friendly technologies, and targeted grants or subsidies will catalyse private sector participation. Capacity-building programmes are also vital — training entrepreneurs, stakeholders, and bankers in sustainable practices ensures long-term market growth and effectiveness.

A supportive, predictable regulatory environment combined with targeted incentives will be crucial for mobilising private capital at scale to meet the country's ambitious sustainable development goals.",https://tds-images.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2025/08/31/shahnawaz.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 20:56:10.209694

Esteemed Members,

Welcome to the 66th Annual General Meeting of your Company.

This annual meeting is not just a statutory occasion but a celebration of our shared journey — a journey built on trust, resilience, and a steadfast commitment to energise India’s progress.

I extend my heartfelt gratitude to each one of you for your continued confidence in the Company and for staying invested in our vision.

Business Outcomes

The year gone by reminded us that energy is never just about markets and molecules; it is shaped by the pulse of geopolitics.

The Russia–Ukraine conflict, now in its third year, continued to cast a shadow on global stability. New fault lines in the Middle East, disruptions in the Red Sea, and heightened tensions around the Strait of Hormuz unsettled vital energy corridors. Towards the close of the year, tariff hikes in the United States added fresh headwinds, shaking investor confidence.

Against this backdrop of volatility and uncertainty, your Company delivered a resilient performance during 2024–25.

Sales volumes crossed the historic 100 million metric tonne mark, supported by beyond-capacity processing across 10 refineries.

Our 20,000 km pipeline network ensured seamless movement of hydrocarbons, underscoring the strength of our integrated model.

With over 40,000 fuel stations energising 3.2 crore customers every day, and Indane LPG trusted in 15 crore kitchens, IndianOil remains at the heart of India’s energy ecosystem.

Alongside refining and marketing, we maintained a strong presence in petrochemicals, natural gas, and E&P, reinforcing our diversified energy footprint.

On the financial front:

Revenue from Operations stood at ₹8.45 lakh crore, keeping us among India’s top three corporates.

Net Profit was ₹12,962 crore — the highest among OMC peers, though moderated from last year due to weaker refining margins, LPG under-recoveries, and exchange losses.

In Q1 FY 2025–26, your Company delivered its highest-ever quarterly sales and a consolidated net profit of ₹6,808 crore — nearly double that of the same period last year.

SPRINT: Powering Transformation

Resilience alone is not enough. To sustain leadership, we must evolve with speed and agility. With this vision, we launched Project SPRINT this fiscal.

SPRINT sharpens competitiveness across six focus areas:

Strengthening core businesses

Optimising costs

Reinforcing customer-centricity

Accelerating innovation and digitalisation

Nurturing talent

Advancing the energy transition

At its heart lies the 3Cs (Core, Cost, Customer) and 3Ts (Technology, Talent, Transition).

The impact is already visible:

One refinery is on track to become the first PSU refinery in India to achieve a Quartile-1 ranking in the Solomon Benchmarking Index.

Nearly half of new PSU OMC retail outlets since April 2025 have been IndianOil’s.

Non-fuel revenues grew 49% year-on-year in the first four months of this fiscal.

Cost optimisation initiatives are delivering higher efficiency and sustained profitability.

Reinforcing the Legacy

As India prepares to become the largest driver of global oil demand by 2035, your Company is scaling:

Refining capacity from 80.75 MMTPA to 98.4 MMTPA by 2028.

Pipeline network beyond 22,000 km, with 21 projects underway.

Petrochemicals capacity from 4.3 MMTPA to over 13 MMTPA by 2030, with a sharp focus on specialty chemicals.

We also advanced in upstream with 25 assets across India and overseas, including new hydrocarbon discoveries in Abu Dhabi, resumption in Libya, and acquisition of Mercator Petroleum in the Cambay Basin.

India’s Energy Lifeline

From fuel stations, LPG, and CNG to aviation, mobility, lubricants, and natural gas, IndianOil continues to be India’s most trusted energy partner.

Highlights of 2024–25 include:

14,000 EV chargers and 865 battery-swapping stations, advancing clean mobility.

68 Way Side Amenities and 138 Apna Ghar facilities for highway users and truckers.

LPG leadership strengthened with 45% market share and the launch of Chhotu Master (compact 5 kg LPG cylinder + cooktop).

Servo lubricants expanded to 45 countries, including the launch of Servo Futura eV for electric vehicles.

Natural gas sales surged 20% to 7.9 MMTPA; CGD JVs now cover 21% of India’s population.

Pioneering Innovation

Our R&D Centre is driving breakthroughs in green hydrogen, SAF, 2G ethanol, fuel cells, and carbon capture.

eCO₂Sorb, our patented enzyme-based carbon capture solution, is at pilot scale.

42 start-ups incubated under our Start-up Scheme have already generated 86 IPRs and 4 commercialized patents.

The upcoming New R&D Campus at Faridabad will lead frontier research in alternative energy and advanced sciences.

Transition to a Future-Ready Portfolio

We are transitioning into a diversified, integrated energy company anchored on three pillars:

Green Hydrogen – 10,000 TPA plant at Panipat (India’s largest).

Sustainable Aviation Fuel – India’s first ISCC-CORSIA certified SAF project; 30 KTPA from used cooking oil at Panipat.

Renewables – Clean energy portfolio scaling from 1 GW today to 18 GW in three years.

This green shift is supported by strong sustainability actions — 7 lakh trees planted, 89% wastewater reuse, GreenCo certifications, and a Net Zero by 2046 roadmap requiring ₹2.5 lakh crore investment.

Investments and Asset Optimisation

In 2024–25, IndianOil invested ₹40,000 crore, accounting for over one-fourth of MoPNG PSU CAPEX.

Over 160 projects worth ₹2.6 lakh crore are under execution.

Committed ₹1.66 lakh crore over five years with sharp focus on petrochemicals, natural gas, and renewables.

New revenue streams in bitumen, bunkering, LNG, cryogenics, and data transmission services are being seeded.

IOC Global Capital Management (IGCMIL) at GIFT City executed USD 500+ million in transactions, evolving into a Global Treasury Centre.

Driving Social Impact

In 2024–25, IndianOil spent ₹583 crore on CSR, touching 1.36 crore beneficiaries.

Healthcare focus: TB elimination, cancer care, sickle cell anaemia, dialysis centres.

Skilling & empowerment: Women, Divyangjan, and children rehabilitated through Badhte Kadam.

Growth for us is meaningful only when it uplifts lives.

Building Sports Champions

IndianOil athletes won 239 medals in 2024–25, including 85 global medals and India’s historic 29-medal Paralympics haul.

Our DivyaShakti initiative supports 100 para-athletes, half of them women. We remain committed to women’s hockey, para federations, and India’s “Road to LA 2028.”

Governance & Closing

Your Company upholds the highest standards of corporate governance, transparency, and preventive vigilance.

At the core of our journey lies one promise — energising lives with reliability, responsibility, and foresight.

I express my sincere gratitude to the Government of India, the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, regulators, banks, employees, stakeholders, and above all, our customers for their enduring trust and support.

With your continued encouragement, IndianOil will keep energising lives, unlocking new frontiers, and advancing our shared aspiration of a Viksit Bharat.

Thank You.

Managing Director, Eastern Bank

The Daily Star (TDS): How would you assess the current state of sustainable and green banking in Bangladesh?

Ali Reza Iftekhar (ARI): Over the past decade, sustainable and green banking in Bangladesh has made remarkable progress. When Bangladesh Bank first introduced its Sustainable Finance Policy and Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) guidelines, banks mostly treated them as compliance requirements. Today, sustainability has become a strategic priority for the country's leading institutions.

The banking sector now recognizes that financing cannot be separated from realities such as climate change, resource scarcity, and the demand for inclusive finance. Bangladesh Bank has accelerated this shift with green refinancing schemes, channeling affordable funding into renewable energy, waste management, and other green projects. The recent adoption of IFRS S1 and S2 on sustainability and climate disclosures has further aligned us with global standards.

Eastern Bank PLC (EBL) is proud to be ranked among the top ten sustainable banks in Bangladesh Bank's 2024 Sustainability Rating. For us, this recognition validates our long-term ESG commitments—but it is not a destination. It is a responsibility to keep moving forward.

TDS: What sustainable or green financing/refinancing schemes does your bank offer, particularly for SMEs, women entrepreneurs, or environmentally responsible enterprises?

ARI: At EBL, inclusiveness is central to our sustainable finance strategy. In 2024, 35.24% of our total term loan portfolio was directed to green projects—almost double the previous year. Overall, 89% of our portfolio now qualifies as sustainable finance.

We actively utilize Bangladesh Bank's refinancing schemes and have already disbursed over BDT 200 crore to renewable energy, energy efficiency, and waste management ventures. Beyond financing, we offer training, advisory support, and flexible repayment terms for SMEs and women entrepreneurs whose businesses embrace sustainability. We also mobilize foreign funding from DFIs such as IFC, DEG, FMO, OFID, and ADB, primarily for green investments.

To encourage innovation, our EBL Startup Explorer program, launched with Startup Bangladesh, directly finances green and impact-driven startups. We also partner with NGOs to provide tailored refinancing solutions to grassroots entrepreneurs. Our vision is clear: make sustainable finance accessible not just to large corporates, but also to SMEs, women entrepreneurs, and innovators driving change from the ground up.

TDS: What initiatives has your bank undertaken to promote sustainable banking, and how are you reducing your own carbon footprint?

ARI: Sustainability at EBL goes beyond financing—it is embedded in our operations.

Our Head Office is a green building, equipped with solar glass panels generating 16 kW of electricity daily, along with rainwater harvesting and wastewater treatment facilities. We use hybrid vehicles, smart AC systems, and energy-efficient lighting to further reduce consumption.

We are steadily moving towards a paperless culture. By digitizing LC processing, we've reduced paper use by 40–45%, saving more than a million sheets each year. Our e-leave, e-appraisal, and e-learning systems cut paper use further. On the customer side, digital platforms like EBL Connect and SkyPay process billions of taka electronically, reducing the carbon footprint of cash handling while enhancing efficiency and convenience.

EBL is also among the first banks in Bangladesh to measure Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions, including financed emissions, through the Joint Impact Model (JIM). Additionally, our partnership with DHL's GoGreen Plus program reduces 30% of emissions from trade document transport by using Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

TDS: What challenges has your bank encountered in adopting and promoting sustainable banking practices?

ARI: While progress is evident, challenges remain.

Data gaps: Measuring financed emissions across diverse industries remains difficult due to limited data quality and availability.

Awareness and capacity: Many borrowers—particularly SMEs—lack the technical know-how to adopt green technologies. Banks often need to invest in awareness and capacity-building before financing can be effective.

High upfront costs: Renewable energy or green building projects involve significant initial investment, discouraging entrepreneurs despite long-term savings. Here, concessional funding from Bangladesh Bank and DFIs plays a vital role

We believe stronger policy support—such as tax incentives for green technology and a carbon credit framework—would accelerate adoption across the financial sector.

TDS: What are your bank's future plans to advance sustainable banking, and what support do you seek from the government?

ARI: Looking ahead, EBL plans to introduce Green Deposit and Green Asset products, allowing customers to directly contribute to sustainable projects. We are also piloting a Climate Risk Diagnostic and Management Model with IFC and DEG, which integrates climate risk into credit decisions—making us one of the first banks in Bangladesh to embed climate risk into portfolio management.

To scale up these efforts, we seek government support in three areas:

1. Incentives for green investment — including interest subsidies, tax benefits, and accelerated depreciation for renewable and energy-efficient technologies.

2. Capacity-building programs — equipping SMEs and entrepreneurs with the skills to adopt sustainable practices.

3. A robust carbon market framework — enabling banks and businesses to monetize emission reductions and attract greater climate finance.

(Alaska Airlines) -- Hawaiian Airlines will blend sustainable aviation fuel on select flights between Osaka and Honolulu. --

The initiative supports Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines’ strategy to reduce carbon emissions and grow the SAF market.

Hawaiian Airlines today announced it will be incorporating sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on flights between Osaka, Japan, and Honolulu, Hawai‘i under a sales agreement between parent company Alaska Air Group Inc., and Cosmo Oil Marketing Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of Cosmo Energy Holdings Co., Ltd. Fuel deliveries beginning this month at Kansai International Airport will mark the first time Hawaiian Airlines has introduced SAF – which can lower life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

""Japan is an important international market for Hawaiian Airlines, and we appreciate Cosmo’s investment in locally sourced SAF – the most effective technology to lower our carbon emissions – that we are now using on our flights between Osaka and Honolulu.” -- Alanna James, Sustainability innovation directorHawaiian Airlines

The SAF traded under this agreement was commercialized following Cosmo’s receipt of a New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) subsidy from the Japanese government in 2021, aimed at establishing a supply chain model for SAF production from used cooking oil sourced domestically in Japan. Cosmo Energy Group’s facility will be the first to mass produce SAF in Japan and the SAF will come with ISCC CORSIA and ISCC EU certifications. These certifications are part of the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) initiative, which recognizes compliance with international standards for sustainable products.

""SAF is one of our key decarbonization products and plays an essential role in the decarbonization of the aviation industry. We are delighted to contribute to the decarbonization efforts of global airline Alaska Airlines and its customers through SAF. Moving forward, we will continue to support the realization of a decarbonized society, starting with this collaboration, by promoting the use of SAF.” -- Naoki Takayama, President and representative directorCosmo Oil Marketing Co., Ltd.

The fuel will be produced by SAFFAIRE SKY ENERGY LLC, a joint venture formed by Cosmo Oil Co., Ltd., JGC HOLDINGS CORPORATION, and REVO International Inc.

""Since 2021, with the support of the Japanese government, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry’s Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, and NEDO, we have been working with JGC HOLDINGS CORPORATION, Cosmo Oil Co., Ltd., and REVO International Inc. to commercialize SAF. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to everyone involved for helping to build a major wave of domestic resource recycling through activities such as ACT for SKY and Fry to Fly.” -- Takeshi Takada, Representative SAFFAIRE SKY ENERGY LLC

The Cosmo Energy Group has worked to establish a supply chain to deliver Japan’s first locally made SAF, with the goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Group is also helping build social momentum through initiatives such as an ongoing pilot program to collect household used cooking oil at service stations for repurposing into SAF feedstock.

Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines – both founded more than 90 years ago to connect communities, bring people together, transport products, and enable economic growth – are committed to stewarding their environmental impact to create a durable long-term future for the company. As the most fuel-efficient premium U.S. carriers, Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines have an ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 through investments in SAF, technology and fleet modernization, among other initiatives.

With Screen Producers Australia, the LOI outlines a shared vision to bring a delegation of Indian producers to Australia in 2026 for the SCREEN FOREVER conference on the Gold Coast. The initiative, known as India Connect, will create a dynamic platform for co-production opportunities, cultural exchange, and enduring business partnerships. The program includes project-matching forums, delegate selection, and structured networking opportunities designed to foster creative and commercial collaboration between Indian and Australian producers.

The LOI with the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia (NFSA) focuses on heritage preservation, knowledge sharing, and archival collaborations, reinforcing the importance of safeguarding cinematic history. This partnership will enable mutual learning in film restoration, digitisation, and preservation practices, ensuring that future generations can access and celebrate the rich film legacies of both countries.

Speaking about the strategic partnerships, Information & Broadcasting Secretary Shri Sanjay Jaju said, “These partnerships reaffirm NFDC’s commitment to building global bridges for Indian cinema. With Australia, we share not only creative ambitions but also a responsibility to preserve and promote our screen cultures. Together, we look forward to fostering new collaborations that will inspire filmmakers, audiences, and cultural communities across both nations.”

The collaborations will begin rolling out from late 2025, with structured timelines leading up to SCREEN FOREVER 2026 and further archival initiatives with NFSA.

Chinese PFY prices started August on a minor hike due to steady overseas demand and firmer raw material prices.
In the US market, PFY prices followed China’s trend and rose in early August as tighter import availability was compounded by higher downstream buying.
Toward month-end, PFY prices stabilized, reflecting balanced procurement and normalized supply flows.
In the near future, PFY prices in China and the U.S. are expected to remain range-bound, with stability depending on the recovery in seasonal demand and volatility in feedstock prices.","In August 2025, prices of PFY in China and the United States moved in synchronized trajectory, reflecting similar market fundamentals. Both markets began the month on a positive note with strong procurement and upbeat export streams, but mid-month activities dampened pressure to close out the month in a more price range-bound atmosphere. Regardless of local differences in trade flows and production plans, the overall pricing trend of PFY remained synchronized, created by steady supply and moderate demand at textile and apparel markets.

Chinese PFY prices started August on a minor hike due to steady overseas demand and firmer raw material prices. Low PTA levels that limited cost-push support were countered by firm MEG prices to maintain production economics intact. Exports to the U.S., Germany, and India absorbed surplus availability, counterbalancing local softness in demand. Operating levels of production in the moderate-to-high range satisfied steady export orders. No material disruption was visible, and export markets priced competitively thwarted oversupply from cutting prices.

Towards the end of the month, however, declining PTA values and subdued apparel and home-textile offtake exerted downward pressure. With near-92% utilized spinning lines and hand-to-mouth buying at fabric mills, PFY prices softened before levelling off during the final week with unchanging operating rates and normalized purchasing.

In the US market, PFY prices followed China’s trend and rose in early August as tighter import availability was compounded by higher downstream buying. Import offers were raised by Asian vendors, and storm-related bottlenecks at Shanghai and Ningbo drove transit times out, increasing landed costs. Despite a small drop in freight levels, delivery frictions and cautious inventory management allowed sellers to resist deep cuts in prices.

Demand for PFY picked up for back-to-school and early fall programs, with apparel and home-furnishing categories maintaining steady penetration. A 1.75% sequential increase in apparel and accessories sales bolstered replenishment activity. Speculative buying remained in check, though buyers tolerated modest price increases in order to receive on-time delivery. Toward month-end, PFY prices stabilized, reflecting balanced procurement and normalized supply flows.

In the near future, PFY prices in China and the U.S. are expected to remain range-bound, with stability depending on the recovery in seasonal demand and volatility in feedstock prices. In China, preparations for autumn textile season may give mild support, while sustained weakness in local consumption and deteriorating PTA values may limit advances.

On the American side, import-side tightness is expected to ease with alleviating weather disruptions, but sustained demand from apparel and home-furnishing pipelines will underpin current levels of PFY price. Market participants will be closely observing feedstock cues and export dynamics, both sides navigating cautiously optimistic but supply-sensitive ground.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-30 16:56:21.115259

The company aims to capitalize on the growing demand for low-carbon fuels and the increasing adoption of renewable energy policies. Green Plains' strategy involves expanding its renewable energy production capacity, improving operational efficiency, and generating additional revenue through its nitrogen fertilizer business.

Green Plains (NASDAQ: GPRE), an ethanol producer, is undergoing a significant transformation from a consistent cash burn to a free cash flow positive business model. This transition is being driven by operational improvements and the realization of additional revenue streams through strategic investments in renewable energy and carbon capture technologies.

The company's strategy involves expanding its renewable energy production capacity, improving operational efficiency, and generating additional revenue through its nitrogen fertilizer business. Green Plains is leveraging the growing demand for low-carbon fuels and the increasing adoption of renewable energy policies to drive this transformation.

One of the key initiatives in Green Plains' strategic shift is the development of the Trailblazer pipeline. This pipeline, which is connected to three of the company's ethanol plants in Nebraska, will facilitate carbon capture and sequestration. The company plans to monetize the associated carbon credits, which are afforded by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, to boost revenues and EBITDA. Initial estimates suggest that this project could generate between $100-$150 million in EBITDA, making it a transformative project for Green Plains [1].

In addition to the Trailblazer pipeline, Green Plains has committed four additional plants to a prospective sequestration project through Summit Carbon Solutions. This project is still in the permitting phase but is expected to be in service by the first quarter of 2027. The company aims to use the enhanced carbon footprint of its ethanol plants to become eligible for the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which could provide an EBITDA uplift to the company's baseline ethanol business [1].

The company's valuation reflects its transition. Historically, Green Plains has produced volatile EBITDA, with an average of approximately $50 million from the base business. Adding the $125 million benefit from the Trailblazer sequestration project drives the company's EBITDA for 2026 to approximately $175 million. On a forward basis, the company currently trades at roughly 6x 2026 EBITDA, implying a solid value play once this project is fully operational [1].

The sale of the Obion plant for $190 million has also significantly de-levered the company and removed high-cost debt. This transaction provides another layer of value for shareholders, as the company's enterprise value has decreased from $1 billion to approximately $940 million after the sale [1].

However, risks associated with Green Plains' business include reliance on government regulation. Regulatory and government delays can present significant hurdles to realizing the projected cash flows for either of the company's CCS projects. The company's reliance on government entities presents regulatory risks to revenue collection [1].

In conclusion, Green Plains' strategic shift towards free cash flow positivity is driven by operational improvements, the realization of additional revenue streams through carbon capture and renewable energy investments, and the sale of the Obion plant. The company's valuation reflects this transformation, and the market appears to be underestimating the value of the Obion sale. However, regulatory risks remain a significant challenge for the company.

To the modern traveller, they are evolving into aspirational lifestyle spaces, marrying convenience, luxury, and technology—ultimately to create unforgettable experiences that are just as much a part of the journey as the destination itself. In exploring this transformation and the future of travel loyalty, Travel Radar spoke with Christopher Ross, Chief Brand Officer and EMEA Executive Chair at Collinson International, behind Priority Pass.

Airports as Destinations: A Psychological Shift

Airports have evolved far beyond their original role as transit points to becoming destinations in their own right, Ross explains. This transformation has been driven by technological advancements that streamline the airport journey, allowing travellers to move seamlessly… and immerse themselves in new experiences once past security.

World-class airports like Changi and Hamad International have set new benchmarks in automation, service, and experience. For brands, Ross notes:

Airports are no longer just points of transit—they are high-value stages for storytelling, engagement, and loyalty building. The brands that will thrive are those that see the airport as a pivotal touchpoint, investing in experiences, services, and environments that make the journey not only endurable, but aspirational and memorable.

Technology That Connects Emotionally

Technology is not only streamlining journeys—it is also enhancing the emotional experience of travel. According to Ross,

The top three technologies people say are improving their journeys today are digital boarding passes (71%), fast-track through security (68%), and advanced security scanners (62%). These innovations help reduce stress and free up valuable time, allowing people to relax, explore, and savour the airport experience rather than simply rushing from one point to another.

This smoother journey creates richer moments.

Ultimately, the technologies that make the journey smoother are also the ones that create space for richer, more memorable moments, helping travellers to connect more deeply with their surroundings, their companions, and the overall experience of travel.

Priority Pass and the Premium Mindset

Priority Pass offers a network of over 1,700 lounges alongside unique experiences from gaming hubs to sleep pods. Ross explains:

Recent additions include services such as access to health and wellness content on-the-go with TrvlWell. From digital mindfulness modules to guided walking tracks, these resources help ease travel anxiety, save valuable time, and create a smoother, stress-free journey.

Smart technology, seamless digital access, and personalised experiences form the backbone of Priority Pass’ premium approach. Ross continues, “whether it’s more destination choices, or exclusive value-added services, Priority Pass is dedicated to helping travellers get to where they are going with greater ease and comfort.”

Exclusivity, and Loyalty

Airport lounges have become a symbol of lifestyle and brand affinity. Ross underscores this:

Our global Value of Travel Benefits research found that 94% of customers say they would consider switching card providers if airport lounge access was removed – making it a critical offering for customer loyalty and retention.

By offering premium lounge access, brands signal that they understand their customers’ lifestyles and aspirations. Ross continues by explaining how “lounge access benefits create a halo effect for brands, positioning them as enablers of elevated travel experiences, which is especially important for customers who prioritise convenience and luxury.

Opportunities for Growth: Wellness, Dining, and Tech

Airport lounges are busier than ever, and travellers’ expectations are rising. To stay ahead of this demand, Ross explains:

We’re consistently expanding the breadth of our inventory through collaborations, strategic partnerships, and innovation, as well as direct investment in new airport experiences and travel services. He continues, While demand is surging, we’re also making a focused effort to ensure travellers have the relaxing, seamless experience they expect. We’ve invested in technology to transform the control and flexibility available to travellers, such as tech that streamlines capacity management by offering Pre-book capabilities and a fully digital waitlist solution through partners.

Airport 2030: Predictive, Personalised, and Human

Ross envisions airports as “far more digitally connected, predictive, and personalised.” Automation will handle routine processes, while human presence will remain crucial:

Many travellers still see a human presence as a vital anchor in the sometimes-stressful airport environment. In the UK, for example, travellers say human support is essential for customer service (67%), at security and border control (59%), and in lost-and-found services (49%), ensuring automation enhances rather than replaces human reassurance.

Cross-Industry Collaboration: The Key to Seamless Travel

Ross emphasises that the future of airports relies on collaboration across airlines, airports, tech innovators, and loyalty platforms:

Creating seamless, emotionally resonant airport experiences requires every player in the travel ecosystem—from airlines and airports to technology innovators, experience brands, financial services, and loyalty platforms—to work in harmony.

He also notes that, Priority Pass also offers wellness benefits, co-working spaces, airport transfers, car rentals, and access to attractions at destinations, ensuring every journey is memorable.

Reimagining the Terminal

If given the chance to redesign one element of the airport journey, Ross’ focus is clear:

Personally, I would redesign the airport terminal itself. Today’s savvy travellers expect experiences that are authentic and tailored to their unique lifestyles and preferences. By leveraging this data intelligently and responsibly, airports and travel businesses can shape benefits and loyalty programmes that truly resonate with customers, making the airport a more enjoyable, efficient, and personalised space for everyone, and in turn driving both loyalty and revenue.

Airports are now stages for luxury, innovation, and engagement. Priority Pass exemplifies this evolution, offering travellers choice, comfort, and memorable experiences at every step—transforming the journey itself into a destination. For brands, this evolution signals a new era of loyalty, engagement, and aspirational storytelling.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/changi-airport-c-conde-nast-traveller-.webp,N,,2025-08-30 13:56:32.498125

Outlook for 2025 JAL enters late 2025 with strong momentum, a modernizing fleet, and rising passenger volumes.
The Bottom Line Japan Airlines advances into the second half of 2025 with confidence, modern aircraft, and strong inbound demand.","Japan Airlines is steering into 2025 with a dual focus capitalizing on Japan’s unprecedented inbound tourism surge while navigating macroeconomic headwinds such as currency fluctuations and rising operational costs. By modernizing its fleet and strategically expanding market presence, the carrier aims to strike a balance between sustaining growth from booming visitor demand and ensuring long-term financial resilience.

Japan Airlines (JAL) moves into the second half of 2025 with a determined growth strategy. Strong inbound tourism drives international demand, while domestic travel remains solid. The airline strengthens its market position by pairing upgrades on long-haul aircraft with the continued expansion of its low-cost subsidiary ZIPAIR Tokyo. This combination allows JAL to appeal to both premium and budget-conscious travelers, widening its influence across multiple segments.

Passenger demand remains a clear strength, yet cargo revenue no longer matches pandemic-era highs. JAL offsets this shortfall by diversifying revenue streams, including ventures with logistics partners. Even with strong fundamentals, the airline faces external risks such as currency volatility, fluctuating jet fuel costs, and new sustainability requirements.

Fleet Renewal and Market Reach

Japan Airlines is speeding up its fleet renewal by retiring aging long-haul aircraft and bringing in the Airbus A350-1000. The new jets deliver greater fuel efficiency and come equipped with refreshed premium cabins designed to attract high-value travelers. The airline places the A350-1000 on its key route linking Tokyo Haneda (HND) with Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG), a corridor where demand for premium seating remains especially strong. By upgrading the passenger experience on this route, the carrier strengthens its ability to secure higher fares while solidifying its standing in highly competitive international markets.

The carrier intends to roll out the Airbus A350-1000 on additional long-haul routes, targeting key gateways such as New York, Dallas, and Los Angeles. At the same time, it is boosting seasonal capacity on popular leisure destinations to widen international reach. Its low-cost arm, ZIPAIR Tokyo, continues to grow with affordable long-haul services, complementing the premium network. These combined efforts enhance passenger loyalty and allow Japan Airlines to engage travelers across every segment of the market.

Economic Pressures

Macroeconomic conditions present the largest challenges for JAL. Currency swings directly influence travel demand. If the yen strengthens, Japan becomes more expensive for foreign tourists, potentially slowing inbound growth. A weaker yen, however, may discourage outbound leisure and business travel, affecting balance on the other side of the market. JAL must adapt quickly to these shifts to preserve revenue flows.

Fuel costs remain another critical factor. Jet fuel represents the airline’s biggest variable expense. Analysts expect softer prices through the remainder of 2025, but volatility poses constant risk. Any price surge could place immediate pressure on margins, limiting JAL’s ability to reinvest in growth and modernization.

Sustainability Mandates

Japan advances toward a 2030 requirement mandating a 10% blend of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). JAL must prepare to meet this target despite higher costs and limited global supply. The airline faces pressure to secure adequate SAF volumes while controlling operational expenses. Success in this area strengthens its environmental credibility, but failure could expose it to regulatory and financial strain.

By maintaining strong inbound passenger demand and pricing power in premium markets, JAL positions itself to absorb some of these challenges. Nevertheless, SAF compliance represents one of the most significant long-term hurdles for the airline.

Investor Sentiment

Investors maintain confidence in JAL’s outlook despite risks. Over the past year, the airline’s stock returned more than 25%, driven by strong travel recovery and supportive economic conditions. Earlier disruptions tied to global trade policy briefly lowered confidence, reducing JAL’s price-to-earnings ratio to around 9.2. As recovery gained pace, investor trust rebounded, lifting multiples above 11 by midyear.

Not all investors remain optimistic, however. Some hedge against uncertainty by short-selling, citing exposure to fuel volatility, currency fluctuations, and supply constraints. The Japanese aviation sector adds complexity, as only two major carriers—JAL and All Nippon Airways (ANA)—control the market. This duopoly creates stability but also means growth depends more on external factors such as aircraft deliveries and global economic shifts than on domestic competition.

Outlook for 2025

JAL enters late 2025 with strong momentum, a modernizing fleet, and rising passenger volumes. Its ability to capture both premium and budget travelers through JAL and ZIPAIR provides a clear competitive advantage. Currency trends, fuel markets, and sustainability regulations pose real challenges, yet the airline has shown agility in navigating turbulence before.

The path forward requires balancing innovation with financial discipline. By expanding long-haul capacity, investing in passenger experience, and adapting to regulatory shifts, JAL seeks to solidify its role as a leader in Asia-Pacific aviation. For investors, the picture remains cautiously optimistic: strong performance so far suggests resilience, but macroeconomic volatility means risks remain high.

The Bottom Line

Japan Airlines advances into the second half of 2025 with confidence, modern aircraft, and strong inbound demand. Its growth strategy hinges on capturing premium traffic with upgraded long-haul cabins, expanding low-cost options with ZIPAIR, and navigating external pressures such as fuel volatility and SAF mandates.

Japan Airlines is preparing for 2025 by modernizing its fleet and strengthening its market presence, aiming to harness Japan’s tourism boom while countering economic pressures like currency swings and rising costs.

The airline’s financial performance, bolstered by a recovering global travel sector, shows resilience and adaptability. However, success depends heavily on managing external risks that lie outside its control. For now, JAL demonstrates the ability to balance growth with caution, positioning itself as a carrier ready to compete on a global scale in an unpredictable environment.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Japan-Airlines-4-1-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 11:56:40.707994

Chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney told shareholders on Saturday that the company will invest Rs 1.66 trillion over the next five years to scale up its traditional oil operations while pushing aggressively into petrochemicals, natural gas, and renewable energy.

Refining power: capacity to touch 98.4 mt

At the heart of IOC’s plan is a major upgrade of its refining business. The company will raise its crude oil refining capacity from the current 80.75 million tonnes per year to 98.4 million tonnes by 2028.

Expansion projects are underway at Panipat, Gujarat, and Barauni refineries.

The pipeline network will be scaled up to 22,000 km, supported by 21 ongoing projects.

New storage facilities, including in Nepal, will strengthen cross-border energy supply lines.

Petrochemicals push to cut imports

IOC is also turning its attention to petrochemicals, aiming to triple its output from 4.3 million tonnes today to more than 13 million tonnes by 2030. The focus will be on specialty chemicals, an area where India remains import-dependent.

Its retail presence of over 40,000 fuel stations will evolve into multi-energy hubs, integrating:

EV chargers and battery-swapping stations

CNG and LNG dispensing units

Expanded convenience services for India’s growing mobility market

Clean energy and the 2046 net-zero goal

A central pillar of IOC’s strategy is the energy transition. The company has earmarked ₹2.5 trillion for clean energy projects as it targets net zero operational emissions by 2046.

Key areas of focus include:

Expanding renewable power capacity from 1 GW to 18 GW within three years

Green hydrogen production facilities

Sustainable aviation fuel projects

Sahney stressed that this diversification will “future-proof IndianOil” while balancing national energy needs.

Natural gas and new business verticals

IOC’s natural gas segment is seeing rapid growth, with volumes rising 20 percent to 7.9 million tonnes annually. The business now spans:

49 geographical areas across 21 states

Coverage of 21 percent of India’s population

Beyond energy, IOC is expanding into allied businesses such as explosives, cryogenics, and shipping infrastructure, signalling its intent to tap into wider industrial opportunities.

Global headwinds, local resilience

Sahney acknowledged that global turbulence, from the Russia-Ukraine war to Middle East unrest and US trade barriers, continues to roil energy flows. Yet IOC posted record sales of more than 100 million tonnes in FY25, supported by:

A vast retail network reaching every corner of India

Strong pipeline infrastructure

LPG distribution to over 15 crore households

De plus, l’origine des biocarburants autorisés pour l’aviation est très large, et inclut par exemple l’huile de palme si problématique.
En France, le report à 2031 du contrôle des compensations carbone pour les vols nationaux illustre ce recul politique.","L’aviation produit 3 % à 6 % des émissions mondiales de CO2, sans compter sa contribution en vapeur d’eau et en oxydes d’azote. En 2021, au sortir de la crise du Covid, l’Association du transport aérien international (IATA) précisait les moyens d’atteindre la neutralité carbone à l’horizon 2050 : 81 % de l’effort reposait sur les carburants « durables » (sustainable aviation fuel) et sur les technologies de propulsion à l’hydrogène. Le reste passait par des compensations, par le biais de la géo-ingénierie et des achats de crédits carbone. L’avion vert était prêt à décoller !

Que sont devenues ces ambitions ? Le secteur a retrouvé son niveau d’avant Covid avec 5 milliards de passagers en 2025 et ses perspectives de croissance de 3 % par an pourraient le conduire à atteindre 10 milliards de passagers en 2050 alors que la Nasa travaille sur un avion hypersonique pouvant voler à Mach 5 (plus de 6 000 kilomètres par heure). À un tel rythme, les émissions de gaz à effet de serre pourraient tripler d’ici à 2050. Les prévisions traversent une zone de turbulences…

De fait, les promesses techniques et économiques ne sont pas au rendez-vous. Le recours à la biomasse et, ce qui est moins connu des passagers végans, aux graisses animales, se heurte à une offre insuffisante et à la concurrence d’autres secteurs avides de biocarburants à substituer aux énergies fossiles. De plus, l’origine des biocarburants autorisés pour l’aviation est très large, et inclut par exemple l’huile de palme si problématique.

L’hydrogène provient en majorité de sources non renouvelables. En outre, il exige des réservoirs quatre fois plus grands que pour le kérosène et d’être maintenu à – 253 °C pour rester liquide. Notons que les techniques de capture et de séquestration du carbone ne compensent aujourd’hui que 1 % des émissions mondiales de CO2 et que leur coût reste prohibitif.

Quant au système d’échange de crédits carbone Corsia (pour Carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation) créé par l’Organisation de l’aviation civile internationale en 2016, il fait l’objet d’une rafale de critiques : trop d’exemptions prévues, flou sur la provenance des biocarburants, compensations forestières inefficaces… Or mettre en avant des solutions techniques irréalistes pour perpétuer les modèles existants constitue des allégations trompeuses sanctionnées par la loi.

À la suite d’une plainte pour greenwashing du Bureau européen des unions de consommateurs (le BEUC) déposée en 2023, la Commission européenne a ouvert une enquête sur vingt compagnies aériennes qui affirment que le transport aérien peut être durable, écoresponsable ou vert. En juin 2025, le BEUC a publié un rapport indiquant que, malgré quelques améliorations mineures, le compte n’y est pas.

Et il est loin d’y être… La directive Green Claims, anti-greenwashing, est happée par le tourbillon bruxellois de la casse des normes environnementales. En France, le report à 2031 du contrôle des compensations carbone pour les vols nationaux illustre ce recul politique. La coalition de pays, formée lors de la Conférence internationale sur le financement du développement tenue en juillet 2025, n’appelle ni à la sobriété, ni à la réduction des émissions qui aurait pu s’appuyer sur la taxation des billets de première. On se souvient du tollé provoqué par Jean-Marc Jancovici qui proposait d’instaurer non pas des prix dissuasifs, mais un quota individuel de quatre vols par vie pour réduire le trafic aérien.",https://medias.pourlascience.fr/api/v1/images/view/68a44a41e989363dd40bdd12/wide_1300/image.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 12:57:00.046773

This includes initiatives such as green hydrogen production, sustainable aviation fuel, and a significant increase in renewable power capacity from 1 GW to 18 GW within three years. The company is also enhancing its fuel station network, which exceeds 40,000 locations, by adding electric vehicle (EV) chargers, battery-swapping facilities, and CNG/LNG dispensing outlets.

Sahney noted that IOC is sharpening its focus on improving throughput per outlet and exploring non-fuel retail opportunities. The company is also venturing into emerging segments such as bitumen, bunkering, and LNG-based shipping. Furthermore, IOC is investing in coastal infrastructure and data transmission services, ensuring that every investment is made with long-term value creation in mind.

Market Leadership and Innovations

IOC continues to maintain its leadership position in the LPG market, holding a 45% share. The company has recently introduced BIS-certified 5 kg Chhotu Master cylinders, with the first retail outlet launched in Ahmedabad. Additionally, it has rolled out innovative products like XtraBoost nano-additized AutoLPG and Propane Plus for industrial customers. The reach of IOC’s Servo lubricants has expanded to 45 countries, further solidifying its market presence.

In the aviation fuel sector, IOC retains a commanding 54.5% market share and has opened new fueling stations in Srinagar and Rewa. The company’s natural gas volumes have surged by 20%, reaching 7.9 million tonnes annually, supported by global sourcing agreements. Its city gas business has expanded across 49 geographical areas in 21 states. Beyond energy, IOC is also making strides in the explosives sector with new plants in Neyveli and projects in Telangana and Maharashtra.

Challenges and Resilience

Sahney acknowledged the challenges facing the global energy sector, including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, tensions in the Middle East, and disruptions in the Red Sea. These factors, along with new U.S. tariff hikes, have impacted trade flows. Despite these challenges, IOC has achieved significant milestones, surpassing 100 million tonnes in sales and serving over 32 million customers daily through its retail network. The company also supplies LPG to 150 million kitchens across India, demonstrating its resilience and commitment to meeting the energy needs of the nation.

Fuel deliveries have started this month at Kansai International Airport, marking the first time Hawaiian Airlines will use SAF, which can reduce life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

“Japan is one of our most important international markets. Thanks to Cosmo’s investment in locally sourced SAF, we are now able to use this cleaner fuel on our Osaka–Honolulu route. SAF is currently the most effective tool to cut aviation emissions,” said Alanna James, Director of Sustainability Innovation at Hawaiian Airlines.

The SAF supplied under this agreement is produced from used cooking oil collected in Japan. It became commercially available after Cosmo received a subsidy in 2021 from the government-backed New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) to develop a domestic SAF supply chain. The fuel carries ISCC CORSIA and ISCC EU certifications, confirming compliance with international sustainability standards.

By producing ethanol, farmers are now not only growing food but also fuel for vehicles, aviation, construction, and equipment,” he said, adding that corn farmers have already benefitted from better prices for their produce.
Hemant Jain, President of PHDCCI, said the summit has become a key platform to advance India’s climate and energy agenda.
“Ethanol is becoming the preferred choice not just for energy security but also for producing chemicals,” he noted.
Sessions focused on second-generation (2G) ethanol, sustainable aviation fuel, bioplastics, hydrogen, and e-methanol.","Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari on Friday said that corn-based ethanol has raised farmer incomes by nearly Rs 50,000 crore, underlining the role of biofuels in reducing India’s dependence on costly fossil fuel imports and cutting transport-related emissions, which contribute around 40% of the country’s pollution.

Speaking at the 5th International Climate Summit (ICS 2025), organised by the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI), Gadkari said farmers can play a central role in the country’s energy transition.

“Biofuels can reduce our oil imports and help clean the air. By producing ethanol, farmers are now not only growing food but also fuel for vehicles, aviation, construction, and equipment,” he said, adding that corn farmers have already benefitted from better prices for their produce.

Hemant Jain, President of PHDCCI, said the summit has become a key platform to advance India’s climate and energy agenda. He stressed that bioenergy provides renewable and decentralised energy sources, reducing the country’s reliance on imported fuels.

Global experts at the event also noted the importance of corn in the energy transition. Wagner Albuquerque de Almeida, Global Director at IFC, said bio-economy transitions are not only about climate action but also about creating jobs, prosperity, and stronger communities.

Dr. J.P.

Well-to-wake CO2e emissions results The well-to-wake CO2e emissions consist of two contributions: (1) the lifecycle CO2 emissions (production, distribution and combustion); and (2) the inflight non-CO2 emissions (PtW).
The flights at higher cruise altitudes usually have a higher non-CO2 climate impact contribution than flights with lower cruise altitudes26.","Aviation is an important economic sector that provides a fast and reliable means of transportation. However, in 2018, the sector was responsible for the emission of almost 1 Gt CO2, equivalent to 2.4% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions including land use change1. Lee et al. (2021) estimated that the share of anthropogenic effective radiative forcing from aviation was around 4%, including both CO2 and non-CO2 effects1.

The non-CO2 climate impact stems primarily from the releases of nitrogen oxides (NOx), water vapour (H2O), and particle emissions. These non-CO2 effects have strong spatial and temporal dependencies and are associated with a high degree of uncertainty1,2. NOx emissions can lead to positive radiative forcing (warming effect) as they serve as a precursor for short-term ozone (O3) production but also cause a cooling effect as they destroy background methane (CH4) and the associated ozone (named as Primary Mode Ozone, PMO)3,4. Water vapour has a negligible greenhouse gas (GHG) effect when emitted in the lower levels of the troposphere due to its short lifetime, but when emitted at high altitudes (near the tropopause or in the stratosphere), its GHG effect becomes stronger due to its increased residence time5. Soot and sulfur particulate emissions have relatively small direct climate effects, but when H2O condenses onto these particles and freezes to form a contrail, this can lead to a significant positive forcing, especially at night6. In total, the non-CO2 effects represented roughly two-thirds of total aviation’s radiative forcing in 2018 considering the best estimate1.

One way to reduce aviation’s climate impact is by using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)7. For instance, aircraft operators are allowed to use SAF to reduce their carbon offsetting requirements through the Carbon Offsetting & Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS)8. The carbon footprint of SAFs is often quantified in grams of CO2 equivalence per megajoule (gCO2 e/MJ) by means of a Lifecycle Analysis (LCA), which allows the user to identify the environmental benefit of SAF compared to Conventional Jet Fuel (CJF)9,10,11. Based on these findings, a certain type of SAF can be promoted or discouraged by decision-makers. As mandated by regulatory frameworks, e.g., CORSIA, the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) and the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (California), the current LCAs focus mainly on CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions produced from Well to Wake (WtW). The WtW scope is composed of two stages: (1) fuel production and distribution (Well-to-Pump (WtP)) and (2) fuel combustion (Pump-to-Wake (PtW)). Accordingly, 100% SAF has the potential to reduce the lifecycle GHG emissions by up to 94% compared to CJF, depending on the feedstocks and technology pathways, e.g., carbon capture11,12.

When it comes to the PtW non-CO2 emissions, burning SAF can reduce soot particles and thereby reducing contrail radiative forcing13. Meanwhile, SAF has little effect on the NOx emissions14. Therefore, it is necessary to include the climate impact of the non-CO2 emissions from burning SAF when quantifying the climate impact benefits of SAF. The previous work15,16 analyzed the inflight non-CO2 climate effects of SAF using the Global Warming Potential (GWP) with horizons of 20-100-500 years. It was concluded that the incorporation of these non-CO2 effects reduced the relative merit of using SAF, as SAF could not mitigate the non-CO2 climate impact. However, the analysis did not consider the fact that SAF is able to reduce the contrail climate impact17,18 because of the reduced soot emissions compared to CJF19,20. Moreover, recent work from Megill et al.21 tested climate metrics against requirements, such as the consistency between the climate impact evaluation based on a requirement and a scenario analysis. The analysis showed that Average Temperature Response (ATR) as a climate metric was better suited for aviation than, e.g. GWP.

In this study, we perform the Life Cyle Climate Impact Analysis (LCCIA) to evaluate the climate benefit of SAF. To do so, we quantify the climate impact of NOx, H2O and contrails from the PtW stage and convert them to the gCO2e/MJ value based on two climate metrics, GWP and ATR, respectively for time horizons of 20-50-100 years22,23. The resulting gCO2e/MJ values are then combined with the Lifecycle GHG emissions of the CORSIA Eligible Fuels to obtain the overall WtW GHG emissions of SAF24. Accordingly, we reflect on environmental benefits of SAF and show in the discussion that the GHG emission reductions can be increased by allocating SAF to long range flights. The overall approach includes an integrated modelling chain of emission inventory generation, climate impact calculation and Monte Carlo simulations. The details are described in the method section.

Climate impact of inflight emissions for CJF and SAF

Figure 1 shows the radiative forcing (RF) and the resulting near surface temperature change (∆T) caused by in-flight CO2, NOx, H2O emissions and contrails from the beginning of aviation to roughly 100 years after introduction of considerable amount of SAF (i.e., 1940–2130) for two cases: (1) 100% CJF (solid line) and (2) 100% SAF (dotted line). Case (1) assumes all aircraft use CJF from 1940 to 2130. For case (2), all aircraft use 100% CJF from 1940 to 2018, and in 2019 a perturbation is introduced that all aircraft use 100% SAF until 2130. The emission indices and calorific values of CJF and SAF are given in Table 1. The emission index of CO2 for SAF is based on the emissions at the engine tailpipe and does not include the reduction in Lifecyle CO2 in order to evaluate the CO2 equivalence for non-CO2 effects. Furthermore, the change in contrail RF for SAF in Table 1 is due to the reduction of soot number particles and is derived using the methodology from Grewe et al. (2021)25. The GHG emissions in Table 1 considers the amount of CO2 from combustion process. The RF and ∆T in Fig. 1 do not consider WtP emissions from fuel production and distribution. From 2019 onwards, the implementation of SAF will result in lower fuel consumption because of the higher calorific values of the fuel, which slightly reduces CO2, NOx, and soot emissions for given emission indices.

Furthermore, the CO2 emission index (EICO2) of SAF is lower than CJF, hence reducing the total CO2 emission, the corresponding RF and ∆T. Due to the increased H2O emission index (EIH2O) for SAF, the RF and ∆T related to H2O emissions for SAF are slightly higher. The NOx emission index (EINOx) is the same for both fuels, as NOx emissions are mainly affected by the engine architecture and combustion technology not the fuel itself14. The contrail RF of SAF is reduced by about 21% in 2130, mainly due to the reduced soot numbers of burning SAF. The reduction of soot number reduces the contrail lifetime, optical properties, and hence the climate impact18. More details about the RF derivations for SAF are given in Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Table 3. The Supplementary Table 4 compares the change of RF using SAF from different literatures and shows a large variation range from 20% − 50% depending on the model setups. While the current analysis falls into the variation range, further research is required to reduce the uncertainty of using SAF on the contrail radiative forcing.

CO2 equivalent factors for CJF and SAF

Based on the temporal evolution of ∆T in Fig. 1, the ATRi,H (average temperature response over a time horizon of H for an individual climate specie, i) is obtained. Accordingly, the CO2 equivalent (CO2e) factors of individual species as a ratio to the \({\text{ATR}_{\text{CO}_{2},\text{H}}}\) is derived (see Eq. (1)). These CO2e factors indicate the significance of non-CO2 effects on the increase of the average surface temperature compared to the CO2 emissions by CJF and SAF, respectively.

$$\:{CO}_{{2e,\:all,\:\:ATR}_{H}}=\:\frac{{\sum\:}_{i}{\int\:}_{2019}^{2019+H}{\varDelta\:T}_{i}\left(t\right)-{\varDelta\:T}_{i}\left(2019\right)\:dt}{{\int\:}_{2019}^{2019+H}{\varDelta\:T}_{{CO}_{2}}\left(t\right)-{\varDelta\:T}_{{CO}_{2}}\left(2019\right)\:dt}\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:$$

(1)

In Eq. (1), H is the time horizon. The subscript i denotes the climate species of NOx, H2O, CO2 and contrail, respectively. The temperature change in 2019 caused by species i emitted by global aviation before 2019 (i.e.,\(\:{\varDelta\:T}_{i}\left(2019\right)\)) is subtracted to eliminate the temperature change that already has happened before 2019.

In Fig. 2, the CO2e ratios of all individual climate agents for SAF and CJF are presented for three different time horizons of 20, 50 and 100 years. For the shorter time horizon, the CO2e is larger since non-CO2 effects have a stronger short-term climate impact. As the time horizon increases, CO2 emissions build up and the resulting warming effect becomes more prominent over the long term. Hence, the total CO2e ratios reduce.

CO2e ratios based on the GWP have also been calculated following the similar approach of Eq. (1), but based on the time integrated RF. The consequent CO2e ratios indicate how much radiation (stratospherically adjusted RF) is forced back by non-CO2 effects compared to CO2. The results for CO2e ratios based on GWP are present in Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 7 and agree well with available literature15 (see Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary Table 9 for more details).

Well-to-wake CO2e emissions results

The well-to-wake CO2e emissions consist of two contributions: (1) the lifecycle CO2 emissions (production, distribution and combustion); and (2) the inflight non-CO2 emissions (PtW). In Table 1, the amount of CO2 emitted per MJ of fuel due to combustion are 73.3 gCO2/MJ for CJF and 70.2 gCO2/MJ for SAF. By multiplying these values with CO2e ratios in Fig. 2, the PtW CO2e emissions for the inflight non-CO2 effects can be derived. As a result, the PtW CO2e emission of CJF, due to the non-CO2 climate effects, is 167.9 gCO2e/MJ (based on the ATR100). Similarly, the PtW CO2e emissions for the non-CO2 effects of SAF is 147.7 gCO2e/MJ.

The PtW CO2e emissions of SAF for the non-CO2 effects can be flexibly included to any existing LCAs to obtain WtW CO2e emissions of SAF (see Eq. (2)). These novel WtW CO2e values thus represent the lifecycle climate impact in the format of gCO2e/MJ.

$$\:{\left[\frac{g{CO}_{2}e}{MJ}\right]\:}_{WtW}=\:{\left[\frac{g{CO}_{2}e}{MJ}\right]\:}_{WtP}+\:{\left[\frac{g{CO}_{2}e}{MJ}\right]\:}_{PtW}\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:$$

Figure 3 shows a set of WtW CO2e emissions considering the ICAO CORSIA eligible fuels and the CJF based on ATR100. The CORSIA core LCA emissions (in green) are taken from24. The Induced Land Use Change values (referring to the additional land used for fuel production, in pink).

Upon the inclusion of PtW non-CO2 effects, the equivalent CO2 emissions per MJ for CJF increases from 89 (the CORSIA LCA value, orange dotted line) to 256.9 [192.3-334.9] gCO2e/MJ (red dotted line). The PtW CO2e of SAF for the non-CO2 effects is about 147.7 g per MJ (blue bars in Fig. 3), which is slightly less than CJF (167.9 gCO2e/MJ). This indicates that the relative merit of using SAF increases mainly due to the reduction of contrail’s climate impact. For a shorter time horizon of 20- or 50- years, the CO2e ratios shown in Fig. 2 increase considerably, driven by the non-CO2 climate effects. Namely, using these shorter time horizons increases the non-CO2 emission reduction potential from SAF.

Furthermore, it is observed that some pathways like the palm oil (open pond) HEFA and corn grain EtJ, which previously had higher lifecycle emissions than CJF, now have lower WtW CO2e emissions than CJF. This is mainly because SAF contains less aromatics and decreases non-CO2 climate impact, i.e. the contrail impacts. It should be noted that in the RED (the legal framework used for the quantification of emissions reductions in the EU ETS), the standards set for a fuel to be classified as SAF are different. Nevertheless, the PtW values derived in this analysis are still applicable. We find that the intrapathway uncertainty increases which is aligned with the findings in15. If GWP based CO2e ratios were used instead of ATR based CO2e ratios to calculate the PtW results, the intrapathway uncertainty would decrease, as there is more uncertainty associated with calculating temperature change responses than radiative forcing responses.

While having one set of CO2e ratios for the entire fleet is convenient, it is not entirely fair for flights. The flights at higher cruise altitudes usually have a higher non-CO2 climate impact contribution than flights with lower cruise altitudes26. Therefore, flight-distance dependent CO2e factors are calculated for the clusters defined in Table 2 based on (great circle) flight distances. For each group, the ATR100 per climate species are calculated, and accordingly, cluster-specific CO2e ratios are derived for both CJF and SAF (the values are presented in the Supplementary Fig. 5). The main takeaway is that for the shorter-range flights, the climate impact reduction attained with SAF reduces compared to the long-range flights. The main reason is that short flights hardly reach contrail-forming altitudes. Therefore, the lower soot emissions from SAF will not benefit for contrail climate impact.

In this work, the PtW CO2e emissions based on the non-CO2 climate effects from NOx, H2O and contrails are newly derived and are combined with typical ICAO CORSIA LCA emissions to obtain the WtW CO2e emissions. Considering different climate metrics, the final LCCIA WtW varies. An example of considering the ATR100 metric shows that CJF has a WtW CO2e emissions of about 256.9 g per MJ. The LCCIA WtW for SAF varies from about 150 to 250 gCO2e/MJ depending on the exact SAF pathways. Furthermore, non-CO2 effects contribute to approximately 69.6% and 67.7% of the overall in-flight CO2e emissions of CJF & SAF respectively. Two possible ways to decrease this climate impact are by lean combustion engines with less NOx and soot emissions27 or by avoiding climate sensitive areas28,29,30. With the new LCCIA WtW CO2e emissions values, policy and decision-makers can make informed decisions about the climate impact reduction potential of SAF.

One of the primary reasons why non-CO2 effects are currently excluded from the quantification of emissions reduction using CORSIA and EU ETS (RED) is because of the uncertainty associated with their climate impact. We have investigated the impact of a range of uncertainties (see methods) on the equivalent emissions by running a Monte Carlo analysis that generates a whole range of different CO2e factors and pump-to-wake results (grey bars in Figs. 2 and 3). To ensure that non-CO2 climate impact is fairly and adequately accredited, the CO2e factor and PtW results of the Monte Carlo’s 5th percentile can be taken, meaning it is 95% certain that climate impact is at least higher than the accredited value. Moreover, to study the robustness of the model prediction, a sensitivity study has been performed for the NOx RF. By replacing the calculated NOx RF in the AirClim model with the values presented by Lee et al. (2021)1, we observed a significant drop in the magnitude of the CO2e factors (methodology bar in Supplementary Fig. 5), as the climate-chemistry model that was used in the development of AirClim is at the upper end of the ozone increases per NOx emission of the range given in Lee et al. (2021)1. Nevertheless, the variation is within the uncertainty range.

One limitation of this study is that the direct aerosol effects are not considered due to their relatively small values. The absence of sulfur in SAF reduces SO2 and volatile H2SO4 emissions, hence reducing the corresponding cooling effects. Therefore, the CO2e ratio for SAF is slightly underestimated in this regard15. On the other hand, the cooling effect of sulfur-related emissions might be roughly cancelled out by the direct warming effect of soot emissions (see Supplementary information section 7). The results of the ECLIF-II17 and ECLIF-III measurements31 indicate that sulfur particles possibly play a role in soot particle activation, as they are thought to increase the soot particle’s hydrophilicity. A higher soot particle activation will lead to a higher number of ice particles with smaller particle diameters, leading to a decreased sedimentation loss of ice particles and therefore longer contrail lifetime. The induced indirect global warming effects due to change in sulfur contents in SAF require thorough analysis.

Furthermore, a recent study32 indicates that at sufficiently cold temperatures and low soot emission regime (e.g., lean combustion), background sulfur and organic volatile particles can play critical roles in ice nucleation, hence the contrail radiative forcing. In such situations, the benefit of SAF in reducing the contrail climate effect requires further investigation.

The flight range based CO2e ratios shows that the reduction of CO2e emissions increases as the flight range increases, this implies that for limited availability of SAF, allocating it to longer flights with higher flight altitudes would allow more climate benefit, as suggested by33. Further, the previous study also33 showed that the allocation of SAF to night-time flights would have increased climate benefits, as especially the contrails at night have the highest climate impact. If distinct CO2e factors for day and night were used, this could lead to substantially lower CO2e factors for SAF at night and thereby much higher emissions reductions would be achieved per MJ of SAF. Nevertheless, due to the lifetime of contrails, they are advected into day regions, even if they are produced at night, which complicates, though not rule out, the target SAF use.

Moreover, lean combustion engines emit less NOx and soot and will cause a lower climate impact per unit of fuel used, which means that the CO2e factor should also be aircraft type dependent. Even more accurate CO2e factors could be made when they would also be weather type dependent as aircraft operators would then be incentivized to allocate their SAF to flights with the highest probability of e.g. contrails cirrus outbreaks. The more factors are considered by the CO2e factor, the more accurate the quantification of emissions reductions becomes and the better the incentivization of aircraft operators becomes to use SAF at the right time, in the right aircraft and for the right aircraft trajectory. However, this will also result in more work and cost and possibly require running weather simulations before take-off. Further work should focus on exploring different types of CO2e factors, their effect on aircraft operator behavior and the associated cost of making them. In addition, the knowledge and understanding of non-CO2 climate impact must be further deepened and uncertainties included in the assessment of mitigation options such as SAF to better understand the impact of those uncertainties on the mitigation potential.

The LCCIA method used to derive the WtW values is based on the climate response model, AirClim, which considers a global aviation emission inventory adapted for SAF usage, the growth of aircraft traffic and the relevant background atmospheric species, like CO2 and CH4. The entire modelling chain is explained in Supplementary Fig. 1. The detail of each element is described in this section.

Climate assessment

The calculation of global RF and temperature responses resulting from global aviation is performed using AirClim (version 2.0)34,35. AirClim is a non-linear climate-chemistry response model to estimate the atmospheric response, radiative forcing, and near-surface temperature changes resulting from the emissions of CO2, H2O, NOx and contrails. AirClim achieves this by combining emission perturbation data with pre-calculated, altitude- and latitude-dependent atmospheric input data obtained from 85 steady-state simulations performed with the ECHAM4 and E39/CA climate chemistry models. The Supplementary Table 5 shows the RF in 2018 calculated by AirClim model comparing to the literature1. To convert the RF to the temperature response, a set of climate sensitivity parameters were taken from the published literature35 and are used here in this study. The program does not account for the direct warming effects of soot aerosols nor the direct cooling effects of sulfate aerosols. Indirect aerosol-cloud interactions are omitted from consideration as these are very uncertain, and the climate impacts of CO and unburn hydrogen carbons (UHCs) are also disregarded as they represent a negligible portion of aviation climate impact1. A process flow diagram displaying the critical inputs and outputs of AirClim in the context of this research is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. The three main inputs to generate a baseline 100% CJF scenario are (1) an emissions inventory, (2) a fuel background scenario, and (3) a CO2 and CH4 background scenario. For the background, we consider an increasing scenario to represent the growth of the air traffic and the involvement of the atmospheric concentrations.

Emission inventory

The emission inventory used for this research is generated using the Global Aviation Model Emission Inventory (GAMEI) developed in-house36. This model generates a 3D grid representing Earth’s atmosphere with a horizontal resolution of 1° by 1° and a vertical resolution of 1000 feet. The fuel consumption, NOx emissions, non-volatile particulate matters nvPM) and flown kilometres by global aviation in 2019 are calculated. To produce this 3D grid, flight departure and destination airports are taken from a flight database of 2019 from flightradar24 which also indicates aircraft type. For each flight, a trajectory is created and segmented into waypoints. At each waypoint, the aircraft’s performance metrics (fuel flow, rate of climb, and velocity) are calculated using BADA (EUROCONTROL) performance data. CO2 and H2O emissions are calculated by multiplying the used fuel at a certain waypoint with the emission indices of CJF for CO2 and H2O of 3.16 and 1.25 respectively. NOx emissions for each waypoint are calculated using the Boeing Fuel Flow Method 2 (BFFM2)37 and the ICAO Emissions Database (EDB). The result was an emissions inventory with 266.6 Tg fuel, 5.06 Tg NOx and 52.43 × 109 flown km for 2019. The emissions inventory is verified and validated with the emissions inventory from38 in Supplementary information (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1).

Fuel background scenario

The fuel background scenarios used in this study are the “Current Technology” (CurTec) and “Business As Usual” (BAU) scenarios taken from25 (Supplementary information). These are a top-down series of historic fuel use by global aviation and have been extended from 2100 to 2130. For this extension, an annual Revenue Passenger Kilometer growth of 0.5% per annum has been assumed from 2101 to 2150, and it is assumed that the [#pax/flight] will increase from 85 to 88 for both the CurTec as well as the BAU scenario. Lastly, for CurTec, it is assumed that the fuel efficiency stays 4.67 [kg/km] from 2100 to 2150, whereas for the BAU scenario, this [kg/km] is assumed to decrease with 0.25%/year in 2100 and 0.01%/year in 2150. The Supplementary Fig. 3 shows a good agreement between the temporal evaluation of temperature response using the emission inventory in this work when comparing the literature25 under the identify scenario.

CO2 and CH4 background scenario

Another important input for AirClim is a CO2 and CH4 background scenario. For this analysis, the SSP1-2.6 scenario from the IPCC is chosen. The Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios are five distinct socio-economic narratives used by the IPCC and in climate change research that predict different global futures based on varying societal developments39. SSP1 is the sustainability scenario based on so-called “green road” development. The 2.6 refers to the radiative forcing level, specifically 2.6 W/m2 by the year 2100. We have chosen SSP1-2.6 CO2 and CH4 background scenario, since during the assignment of emissions savings to players in the aviation sector, it must be assumed that all other sectors in all countries are also contributing to emissions savings. In the Supplementary Table 10, the effect of varying the CO2 and CH4 background scenarios is presented.

Uncertainty analysis using Monte Carlo

The climate impact of non-CO2 effects is associated with a large uncertainty. To account for this, some of the model input parameters, like the CO2 and CH4 atmospheric residence times, the radiative forcing (RF) strengths and climate sensitivity parameters of all 6 modeled aviation climate agents (CO2, CH4, H2O, O3, PMO and contrail cirrus) are prescribed as uncertainty parameters with uniform uncertainty distributions. This gives a total of 11 parameters for which a uniform uncertainty distribution is prescribed and for which 2000 Monte Carlo simulations are done. 2000 simulations were chosen as by then; good convergence (with nominal/default values) was observed.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-13445-x/MediaObjects/41598_2025_13445_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-08-30 04:56:08.462012

The company using the same site to create platforms that will deliver a multi-pronged, gigawatt-scale clean energy ecosystem -- solar, battery storage, hydrogen -- all under one roof, he said.

""Jamnagar will be the cradle of both the world's largest Conventional Energy complex and the world's largest New Energy complex. Jamnagar is the face of New Reliance and New India,"" he said.

Having started the first line for manufacturing of solar panels, the company is now looking to scale up to 20 GWp capacity in coming quarters, which would be the largest solar manufacturing facility and the most integrated single-site solar complex globally, he said.

""We have successfully produced our first 200 MW of HJT modules. These deliver 10 per cent higher energy yield, 20 per cent better temperature performance, and 25 per cent lower degradation,"" he said. ""We are scaling rapidly."" In parallel, it is rapidly constructing battery and electrolyser giga factories. ""Our battery giga factory will start in 2026. It will begin with 40 GWh per year capacity and expand modularly to 100 GWh per year,"" he said.

The electrolyser giga factory will also be operational by end-2026, with the ability to scale up to 3 GW per year. ""It will enable cost-competitive green hydrogen production at global scale, backed by exclusive global technology partnerships, and strengthened by our in-house capabilities,"" he said.

""At peak, we will deploy 55 MW of solar modules and 150 MWh of battery containers every day. This will be among the fastest installations globally. This single site could meet nearly 10 per cent of India's electricity needs within the next decade,"" he said.

""We will produce and export green ammonia, green methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel. This will make India a global hub for cost-competitive green hydrogen and its derivatives,"" he said.

While the initial focus will be to meet Reliance's own large captive demand, it plans to scale up to 3 million tonnes of green hydrogen equivalent production capacity by 2032.

Reliance, he said, is also building compressed biogas (CBG) plants with an annual capacity of 0.5 million tonnes. ""Our target is to scale up to 500+ CBG plants by 2030,"" he said.

Ambani said the company is investing Rs 75,000 crore in a 1.2 million tonne PVC plant at Nagothane in Maharashtra, expansion of a PTA facility at Dahej in Gujarat and a 1 million tonne specialty polyester facility at Palghar.

""These projects are positioned to meet India's rising demand,"" he said. ""Our Hazira carbon fibre facility will be one of the world's three largest, serving aerospace, Defence, and Advanced Materials."" On Jamnagar refineries, it said the company was ""on course to realising the autonomous refinery"".

At Jamnagar, the firm has set up the world's largest Bioenergy Technology and R&D centre. Here, it is developing advanced enzymes, microbial consortia, and high-yield energy crops to boost biogas productivity.

""We are also realising our Chairman's (Mukesh Ambani) vision of growing energy plantations on wastelands. This includes building the world's first integrated energy hub, combining smart farms, modular CBG and green hydrogen plants, agrivoltaics, and batteries,"" Anant said.

""I am especially proud of our agrivoltaics business, where Compressed Biogas (CBG) and Solar PV are deployed on the same land. By capturing biogenic CO2 from CBG plants, these hubs will become platforms for green chemicals, aiming at fossil parity."" This model creates triple value for Indian farmers -- green gas, green electricity, and higher rural incomes. It will be a powerful growth engine for India's clean energy future.",https://media.assettype.com/outlookbusiness/2025-08-30/7ah78xle/solar-panels-field-wind-turbines-horizon-renewable-green-energy.jpg?w=1200&amp;ar=40%3A21&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;ogImage=true&amp;mode=crop&amp;enlarge=true&amp;overlay=false&amp;overlay_position=bottom&amp;overlay_width=100,N,,2025-08-30 04:56:12.463204

We are optimistic the EU will implement the WTO decision on biodiesel,” said Djatmiko Bris Witjaksono, Director General of International Trade Negotiations, on Thursday, August 28, 2025.
Under the ruling, the EU has fifteen months to comply, meaning the duties must be removed by November 22, 2026.
“With these findings, the WTO made it clear that the EU’s countervailing duties on Indonesian biodiesel were not based on solid evidence,” Budi said.","Indonesia’s Ministry of Trade is confident that the European Union (EU) will comply with a World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling that favored Indonesia in its dispute over countervailing duties on biodiesel exports, reports Indonesia Business Post.

The case, registered as DS618, centered on the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive II (RED II), which Indonesia argued discriminated against crude palm oil. The WTO panel sided with Indonesia, and the EU has agreed to amend RED II by February 24, 2026.

“We expect the European Union to respond sensibly and fairly to this ruling. We are optimistic the EU will implement the WTO decision on biodiesel,” said Djatmiko Bris Witjaksono, Director General of International Trade Negotiations, on Thursday, August 28, 2025.

The WTO found that the EU’s reasoning for imposing duties ranging from 8 to 18 percent on Indonesian biodiesel was not supported by sufficient evidence and recommended that the measures be adjusted. Under the ruling, the EU has fifteen months to comply, meaning the duties must be removed by November 22, 2026.

Djatmiko described Indonesia’s win as a signal to its trading partners to act carefully when drafting trade measures related to Indonesian commodities, stressing that all WTO members are obliged to ensure their policies are consistent with international trade rules.

Trade Minister Budi Santoso echoed this view, calling the ruling proof of Indonesia’s consistent compliance with global trade regulations, in contrast to the EU’s accusations. He said the WTO panel dismissed the EU’s claim that Indonesia pushed palm oil producers to sell raw materials at artificially low prices for the benefit of biodiesel companies. It also concluded that Indonesia’s export taxes and levies on palm oil could not be treated as subsidies, and that the European Commission had failed to show any real harm to European biodiesel producers, overlooking other factors that affect the market.

“Fleet renewal is one of the most complex decisions for any airline, as a wrong choice can lead to severe consequences.
“Onboard Croatia Airlines’ A220, passengers can enjoy high-speed inflight Wi-Fi for the first time in the company’s history.","Playing a strategic role in Croatia’s transportation infrastructure, Croatia Airlines ensures optimal air connectivity across the country and internationally. Croatia Airlines is a full-service carrier that provides domestic and international air passenger and cargo transport services within Europe, as well as providing aircraft maintenance and professional training of aviation personnel.

In 2024, the company’s 35th year of operation, Croatia Airlines embarked on the largest project in its history, a complete fleet renewal with the Airbus A220. The first A220 aircraft was introduced to the fleet in July 2024, followed by the second in December of the same year, with the plan to have 15 new A220 aircraft in the fleet by 2027. During 2025, five new aircraft will be delivered (three have already arrived), five more in 2026, and the final three in 2027.

Davor Misic, Director of Operations and Fleet, joins us to elaborate on how this project will benefit the business and its operations moving forward. “Our fleet renewal project is the biggest project in the history of the company and is a significant step for Croatia’s economy and tourism, pushing boundaries and opening new possibilities,” Davor opens. “This project will facilitate further development, enabling successful and sustainable operations in the future. It also further confirms the position of Croatia Airlines as a strategically important segment of Croatia’s transport and tourism infrastructure.

“We’re constantly aware of the significance of Croatia Airlines for the country and its passengers, and this program will enhance operational efficiency, reduce environmental impact, and improve the overall passenger experience. With each new arrival, we are getting closer to achieving the goals of our post Covid-19 strategy while consistently following our mission and vision.

“Fleet renewal is one of the most complex decisions for any airline, as a wrong choice can lead to severe consequences. It is a strategic decision made for a long-term period of approximately ten-to-15 years and cannot be implemented over a short period of time. However, the Airbus 220 aircraft represent a new generation and are designed as an entirely new product. They offer the best performance in terms of efficiency and noise emissions, as well as premium experience for crew and passengers, thanks to innovative design and state-of-the-art technology. Airbus 220s are designed for the market segment of passenger aircraft with 100-to-150 seats, with a maximum range of up to 6700 kilometers.”

Croatia Airlines sets clear goals for the fleet modernization process, assessing multiple dimensions like increased efficiency, compliance with environmental regulations, simplified technical maintenance procedures, and enhanced passenger comfort. “The A220 features an innovative cabin design focused on comfort, with the widest seats and highest ceiling in its class, increased legroom, a quieter cabin, a wider aisle, more overhead storage space, and large panoramic windows that allow more natural light into the cabin,” Davor explains. “Onboard Croatia Airlines’ A220, passengers can enjoy high-speed inflight Wi-Fi for the first time in the company’s history. Each seat is equipped with USB-A and USB-C ports, a smartphone and tablet holder, and access to wireless digital content, all of which contribute to a more connected and personalized travel experience.

“Beyond fleet renewal, which represents a significant technological leap for us, achieving 25 percent lower fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions, Croatia Airlines has implemented ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 standards for environmental and energy management over recent years. We have started using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on selected flights and plan to replace airport service vehicles with electric alternatives.”

Croatia Airlines has been a member of Star Alliance since 2004, and this partnership remains vital for the company, offering collaboration, strategic advantages in global connectivity, reputation, and innovation. “Our membership of Star Alliance provides access to a global flight network, enhancing Croatia’s connectivity and attracting travellers from around the world,” Davor states. “Being part of the world’s largest airline alliance strengthens our reputation and reinforces our position as a reliable, high-quality carrier. We also partner with the Croatian airline, Trade Air, to ensure availability in markets where the airline does not operate direct flights or to increase capacity on existing routes.”

As our conversation closes, Davor turns to what’s facing Croatia Airlines in the remainder of 2025. “Our key priorities are centered around continuing the successful implementation of our fleet renewal program, with additional Airbus A2200 aircraft set to arrive,” he states. “Training our crew remains a top priority, as we must ensure safe and efficient operations with the new aircraft. We’re also strengthening existing strategic partnerships and exploring new route opportunities within Europe and the Mediterranean as we work to further improve connectivity and support Croatia’s economic growth.

“We’re focusing on further business optimization, fleet modernization, and enhanced competitiveness. Once the fleet renewal is completed, our focus will shift to consolidating the benefits of this investment, ensuring improved operational reliability, cost-efficiency, and environmental performance. Over the next five years, we aim to strengthen our role as Croatia’s national carrier by continuing to provide safe, high-quality, and reliable service, while supporting the country’s connectivity, tourism, and economic development.

“If there’s one final message, it’s that the time has come to visit Croatia. Zagreb, Split, Dubrovnik, Zadar, Pula, Rijeka, and Osijek are available to our passengers all year round,” Davor concludes. “Come and experience our warm hospitality, rich tourist offerings, natural beauty, cultural heritage, and the unique identity of each Croatian region.”",https://tlimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/Croatia-Airlines-133-headline-image.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 02:56:09.107367

Conclusion: A High-Risk, High-Reward Proposition Spirit Airlines’ post-Chapter 11 restructuring embodies a classic high-risk, high-reward scenario.","Spirit Airlines’ recent Chapter 11 restructuring has positioned it at a crossroads, balancing aggressive debt reduction with existential liquidity risks in a volatile post-pandemic airline sector. The carrier’s March 2025 emergence from bankruptcy—marked by a $795 million debt-to-equity swap and $350 million in new equity—initially signaled a path to stability. However, its Q2 2025 net loss of $246 million and a 53% drop in liquidity to $407.5 million underscore the fragility of its recovery [1]. This analysis evaluates whether Spirit’s strategic restructuring can offset sector-specific headwinds, including fuel volatility, labor shortages, and shifting consumer preferences.

Strategic Restructuring: Debt Reduction and Operational Overhaul

Spirit’s Chapter 11 process focused on three pillars: deleveraging, fleet optimization, and cost restructuring. By converting $795 million in debt to equity and securing $350 million in fresh capital, the airline reduced its debt burden while retaining operational flexibility [2]. However, these measures have proven insufficient to address its $600 million free cash flow deficit for 2025 [3]. To bolster liquidity, Spirit has sold 23 Airbus aircraft and 14 spare engines, generating $449 million and $250 million, respectively [4]. These asset disposals, while necessary, highlight the airline’s reliance on short-term fixes rather than sustainable operational improvements.

Operational adjustments include a 27.7% reduction in flight capacity for Q3 2025 and furloughs of 270 pilots, reflecting a shift toward aligning capacity with “profitable demand” [5]. Yet, critics argue that Spirit’s restructuring lacks ambition, particularly in renegotiating aircraft leases or addressing its bloated cost structure [6]. For instance, its adjusted CASM ex-fuel rose to 8.77 cents in Q2 2025, outpacing the industry average of 7.36 cents in 2024 [7].

Sector-Specific Risks: A Perfect Storm for Low-Cost Carriers

Spirit’s challenges are compounded by broader industry trends. Fuel prices, averaging $87 per barrel in 2025, remain a significant cost driver [8]. Meanwhile, labor shortages—particularly in pilot and maintenance technician roles—threaten operational reliability [9]. Regulatory pressures, such as the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), add further complexity, with SAF priced at 4.2 times conventional jet fuel [10].

The post-pandemic demand landscape also favors premium services over budget travel. Spirit’s pivot to tiered fare classes (Spirit First, Premium Economy, and Value) aims to capture this shift, but its core customer base may resist paying for amenities it historically avoided [11]. This strategic tension mirrors broader industry struggles, as legacy carriers like Delta and Southwest achieve operating margins of 7.55% and 2.17%, respectively, while Spirit’s Q2 2025 margin hit -18% [12].

Liquidity Crisis and the Path Forward

Spirit’s liquidity position remains precarious. With $2.689 billion in debt and $1.1 billion in long-term repayments due in 2025, the airline has maxed out its $275 million revolving credit facility and secured a card-processing agreement that allows U.S. Bank to hold up to $3 million daily in collateral [13]. These measures, while stabilizing for now, signal a high-risk reliance on external financing.

The airline’s survival hinges on three factors:

1. Successful execution of cost-cutting measures, including further capacity reductions and lease renegotiations.

2. Securing additional equity or debt financing to bridge its liquidity gap.

3. Adapting its value proposition to retain budget travelers while monetizing premium demand [14].

However, the likelihood of another bankruptcy filing looms large. Aircraft lessors have already begun assessing interest in remarketing Spirit’s fleet, and management has warned of “substantial doubt” regarding the airline’s ability to continue as a going concern [15].

Conclusion: A High-Risk, High-Reward Proposition

Spirit Airlines’ post-Chapter 11 restructuring embodies a classic high-risk, high-reward scenario. While its aggressive deleveraging and operational overhauls provide a foundation for recovery, the airline’s liquidity crisis and structural challenges in the low-cost model pose existential threats. For investors, the key question is whether Spirit can execute its transformation without further bankruptcies—a feat that would require both operational discipline and favorable market conditions. In a sector where peers like Delta and Southwest enjoy robust margins, Spirit’s path to profitability remains fraught with uncertainty.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-30 05:56:22.737073

((Beijing Institute of Technology Press Co., Ltd/EurekAlert!) As the world grapples with climate change and dwindling fossil fuel reserves, biodiesel emerges as a promising renewable alternative to conventional diesel. However, the journey toward sustainable biodiesel production faces significant hurdles, particularly in selecting the right feedstocks that don't compete with food supplies. A groundbreaking comprehensive review reveals how artificial neural networks (ANNs) and deep learning technologies are revolutionizing this field, offering unprecedented solutions to longstanding challenges.

Traditional biodiesel production relies heavily on edible crops like soybean, palm oil, and rapeseed – creating a problematic ""food versus fuel"" competition. With fossil fuels still accounting for 88% of global energy consumption, the urgency to develop sustainable alternatives has never been greater. Second-generation biodiesel, derived from non-edible sources such as algae and jatropha, presents an attractive solution but faces obstacles including high production costs and limited commercial viability. This is where deep learning enters the picture, offering a transformative approach to feedstock selection and production optimization.

The research demonstrates remarkable achievements through deep learning applications. ANNs have shown superior predictive accuracy compared to traditional statistical methods, with some models achieving R² values exceeding 90% in predicting crucial biodiesel properties like kinematic viscosity and cetane numbers. These neural networks excel at analyzing complex relationships between feedstock characteristics, production parameters, and environmental factors, enabling rapid assessment of diverse feedstock options without extensive experimental testing.

Particularly impressive are the results from hybrid deep learning models that combine generative and discriminative approaches. For instance, researchers using genetic algorithm-based support vector machines (GA-SVM) successfully optimized biodiesel production from waste cooking oil, while others achieved significant yield improvements by integrating ANNs with response surface methodology (RSM). These advances translate to substantial time and cost savings – critical factors for commercial viability.

The integration of deep learning with Internet of Things (IoT) technology promises to revolutionize biofuel production further. Real-time monitoring and optimization through IoT sensors combined with predictive modeling enable unprecedented control over production processes. This synergy allows manufacturers to adapt quickly to varying feedstock qualities and market demands while maintaining optimal efficiency.

Future applications include developing comprehensive ANN models applicable across diverse engine types and fuel variations, enhancing transferability between different geographical regions and feedstock types. The potential for multi-omics integration and advanced data augmentation techniques will address current limitations in dataset size and model generalization, opening doors to previously unexplored feedstock sources.

This comprehensive review underscores deep learning's pivotal role in accelerating biodiesel development as a sustainable fuel alternative. By dramatically reducing the time and resources needed for feedstock evaluation and process optimization, ANNs are breaking down barriers that have long hindered biodiesel's commercial expansion. The technology's ability to uncover hidden correlations within complex datasets not only advances scientific understanding but also paves the way for more efficient, environmentally friendly fuel production.

As we stand at the intersection of artificial intelligence and renewable energy, the innovative application of deep learning in biodiesel production represents more than technological advancement – it embodies our commitment to a sustainable future where renewable fuels can effectively compete with and eventually replace fossil fuels.

Speaking at the company’s annual general meeting for the first time, Anant Ambani, Executive Director and son of Chairman Mukesh Ambani, laid out the company’s vision to create one of the world’s most integrated renewable energy ecosystems — spanning solar modules, batteries, electrolysers, and green fuels like ammonia and methanol.

Reliance is investing in the entire clean energy value chain: from producing solar modules and energy storage systems to building electrolysers that use renewable electricity to generate hydrogen — seen as a key fuel for the future. The company also plans to produce sustainable aviation fuel and biofuels from organic waste for both domestic use and export.

“We are building platforms to deliver a comprehensive clean energy ecosystem — solar, battery storage, hydrogen — all at scale and under one umbrella,” said Anant Ambani. The products manufactured at these giga factories will support 24/7 renewable electricity supply and help produce green chemicals including green ammonia, e-methanol, and sustainable aviation fuels.

Jamnagar, already home to Reliance’s twin oil refineries — the world’s largest refining complex — is being transformed into the base for the company’s renewable energy ambitions. Construction of the Dhirubhai Ambani Giga Energy Complex is progressing rapidly and is expected to become the world’s largest clean energy hub in terms of scale and integration.

“Jamnagar will represent both the legacy of conventional energy and the future of new energy,” Mr Ambani said. Reliance has already begun producing solar photovoltaic modules at its Jamnagar facility. The company aims to scale up to a capacity of 20 GWp in the coming quarters, making it the largest single-site solar manufacturing facility in the world.

So far, it has successfully produced its first 200 MW of heterojunction (HJT) modules, which offer better performance and durability compared to conventional modules.

Alongside solar, the company is also building battery and electrolyser giga factories. The battery facility, scheduled to open in 2026, will start with an annual capacity of 40 GWh and expand to 100 GWh in phases. The electrolyser plant, also set to be operational by the end of 2026, will have the ability to scale up to 3 GW annually — supporting cost-effective hydrogen production on a global scale.

In Kutch, Gujarat, Reliance is developing one of the largest single-site solar projects in the world, covering 550,000 acres of arid land. At full pace, the site will deploy 55 MW of solar modules and 150 MWh of battery containers every day. Once complete, it could supply nearly 10% of India’s electricity demand within the next decade.

The company’s logistics and port infrastructure in Jamnagar and Kandla will support export operations for green hydrogen derivatives such as ammonia and methanol.

“India can become a global leader in affordable green hydrogen and its derivatives,” said Ambani, noting that the initial phase of production will serve the company’s own needs before scaling to 3 million tonnes per year by 2032.

Reliance is also focusing on bioenergy. It is building compressed biogas (CBG) plants with a target capacity of 0.5 million tonnes per year, aiming to scale to over 500 plants by 2030.

To support this, the company has set up the world’s largest Bioenergy Technology and R&D Centre in Jamnagar, where it is developing advanced technologies to increase biogas yields, including enzymes, microbes, and high-efficiency energy crops.

As part of its broader clean energy strategy, Reliance is also launching integrated energy hubs that combine smart farming, biogas and hydrogen production, agrivoltaics (dual land use for agriculture and solar power), and battery storage. These hubs aim to capture CO2 from CBG plants for green chemical production, targeting cost parity with fossil fuels.",https://themachinemaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Anant-Ambani-Executive-Director.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 21:56:19.765130

The airline’s lease obligations, a critical but underappreciated component of its financial strain, further complicate its path to recovery.
As of 2025, Spirit operates 146 aircraft under operating leases with terms expiring between 2026 and 2043.
These leases account for $7.66 billion of its $14.729 billion in total future contractual obligations [3].
For contrarian investors, the allure of a potential rebound is undeniable, but the risks of a second bankruptcy filing—and the associated losses—remain formidable.","Spirit Airlines’ second Chapter 11 filing in less than a year underscores a liquidity crisis that has spiraled beyond even the most pessimistic projections. Emerging from bankruptcy in March 2025 with a $795 million debt-to-equity swap and $350 million in new capital, the airline initially appeared to stabilize its finances. Yet, by Q2 2025, it reported a staggering $246 million net loss, with liquidity reserves plummeting to $407.5 million—a 53% drop from Q1 2025 [2]. This collapse has forced the airline to confront a $600 million free cash flow deficit for the year and a debt burden of $2.689 billion, including $1.1 billion in repayments due in 2025 alone [4].

The airline’s lease obligations, a critical but underappreciated component of its financial strain, further complicate its path to recovery. As of 2025, Spirit operates 146 aircraft under operating leases with terms expiring between 2026 and 2043. These leases account for $7.66 billion of its $14.729 billion in total future contractual obligations [3]. Despite its recent restructuring, the airline failed to renegotiate these leases during its first Chapter 11 filing, a missed opportunity that has left it saddled with high leasing costs and an aging fleet of Airbus A320s [1]. This oversight has exacerbated its operational inefficiencies, with adjusted cost per available seat mile (CASM) ex-fuel rising to 8.77 cents in Q2 2025—well above the industry average of 7.36 cents [2].

The airline’s survival strategy hinges on aggressive cost-cutting and asset sales. It has sold 23 Airbus aircraft and 14 spare engines for $449 million and $250 million, respectively, while reducing Q3 2025 flight capacity by 27.7% to align with profitable demand [2]. However, these measures come at a cost: furloughing 270 pilots and grounding aircraft due to Pratt & Whitney engine issues have eroded operational flexibility and customer trust [4]. Meanwhile, its revolving credit facility—a $275 million lifeline—has been fully drawn, and its credit card processor is demanding additional collateral to renew its agreement [5].

For contrarian investors, the question is whether these steps can catalyze a sustainable turnaround. The airline’s restructuring aims to generate “hundreds of millions of dollars in annual operating savings” by rightsizing its fleet and redesigning its network [1]. Yet, the feasibility of this plan is clouded by external headwinds. Fuel prices remain elevated at $87 per barrel, and the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel—priced 4.2 times higher than conventional jet fuel—threatens to further strain its low-cost model [2]. Additionally, Spirit’s pivot to tiered fare classes (Spirit First, Premium Economy, and Value) may not offset the reputational damage from its cost-cutting measures [2].

The valuation risks for investors are stark. Spirit’s credit rating has been downgraded to CCC- by Fitch and Caa3 by Moody’s, reflecting its weak liquidity and high debt burden [5]. Its parent company, Spirit Aviation Holdings, has issued a “substantial doubt” warning about its ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months [3]. While the airline’s Chapter 11 filing in August 2025 provides a legal framework to renegotiate leases and reduce debt, the absence of a clear path to profitability—particularly in a market dominated by more efficient rivals—makes this a high-stakes gamble.

In the end, Spirit’s story is one of desperation and incrementalism. Its restructuring efforts, while necessary, lack the transformative vision required to compete in a post-pandemic aviation landscape. For contrarian investors, the allure of a potential rebound is undeniable, but the risks of a second bankruptcy filing—and the associated losses—remain formidable. As the airline navigates its latest crisis, the question is not whether it can survive, but whether it can thrive in an industry that has already moved on.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-29 21:56:28.290950

In 2024, Brazil launched its National Sustainable Aviation Fuel Program (ProBioQAV) to promote SAF adoption in its energy mix.
The NCGA says this naturally favors Brazil’s double-cropping of soybeans and corn while devaluing the lifecycle profile of the U.S. single-crop corn system.
The U.S. State Department objected, claiming the recommendation would “unfairly penalize” American farmers to Brazil’s benefit in global markets.
President Trump has already cut tax incentives for renewable energy and limited SAF benefits exclusively to producers and feedstocks from North America, where SAF is primarily made from corn ethanol.","The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) will hold a public hearing next Wednesday at the U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington as part of its ongoing investigation into whether Brazil’s actions, policies, and practices are unjustifiable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce.

The Section 301 investigation—under which the U.S. can impose trade sanctions on foreign partners—may conclude within six months to a year, aligning with Brazil’s 2026 election calendar. In Brazil, government officials are convinced that tensions with the U.S. will persist through next year and could escalate further.

Some American business groups are using the investigation to increase pressure on Brazil. The American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), for instance, urged the Trump administration to intervene in a deal in which Anglo American is selling its nickel operations in Brazil to Chinese miner MMG, arguing the transaction would give China even greater control over global reserves of critical minerals.

Meanwhile, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) is urging the USTR not only to demand compensation from Brazil for alleged losses in U.S. ethanol exports, but also to take aim at another perceived threat: Brazil’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) program.

Ethanol has become a major topic for Donald Trump when discussing trade with Brazil and holds significant political importance for Republicans. When President Trump issued his executive order to prepare retaliation tariffs at the start of his administration, Brazil was the first country mentioned, and ethanol was the first product.

U.S. corn producers broadly argue that Brazil’s rapid agricultural expansion in recent years has been “partly driven by protectionist advantages and decades of neglect regarding deforestation” in the Amazon and the Cerrado, enabling Brazil to seize market share from American farmers.

Additionally, they view Brazil as a “serious threat” to the long-term competitiveness of U.S. exports in the emerging SAF market, which is seen as key to the global aviation industry’s goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Brazil is viewed as a major potential supplier of the renewable fuel, which can be produced through various technologies.

In 2024, Brazil launched its National Sustainable Aviation Fuel Program (ProBioQAV) to promote SAF adoption in its energy mix. Airlines are required to increase SAF use by 1 percentage point annually until reaching 10% in 2036.

One complaint is that Brazil uses a carbon-neutral emissions model that assigns a premium to the lifecycle assessment of feedstocks from multiple crop cycles (main and second harvest) grown on formerly “degraded” pastureland. The NCGA says this naturally favors Brazil’s double-cropping of soybeans and corn while devaluing the lifecycle profile of the U.S. single-crop corn system.

The NCGA raises concerns that Brazil has emerged as a central player in international standard-setting bodies for biofuels, such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

As an example, they noted that earlier this year, ICAO’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP) approved a recommendation on multi-cropping based on the Brazilian model. The U.S. State Department objected, claiming the recommendation would “unfairly penalize” American farmers to Brazil’s benefit in global markets.

U.S. producers fear that as international bodies and foreign markets, such as Japan and the European Union, begin to accept Brazil’s sustainability claims related to its multi-cropping systems, U.S. export competitiveness could be severely impacted. They warn of potential declines in the commercial value of American agricultural production and farmland, lost export revenue, reduced profits, and higher financing costs and risks for U.S. farmers and ethanol producers.

“That’s why the U.S. State Department raised objections with ICAO,” NCGA said. “The USTR should join the State Department’s efforts to address Brazil’s troubling influence in these international markets.”

The NCGA is proposing the creation of a U.S.-Brazil working group 90 days after the USTR’s investigation, aimed specifically at addressing emissions modeling in international forums. The goal would be to “eliminate the unjust and scientifically unfounded burden that Brazil’s model imposes on the competitiveness of U.S. exports.”

It also called on the USTR to work with government counterparts to ban the use of Brazilian ethanol in the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program until U.S. producers gain reciprocal access to Brazil’s RenovaBio program. President Trump has already cut tax incentives for renewable energy and limited SAF benefits exclusively to producers and feedstocks from North America, where SAF is primarily made from corn ethanol.",https://www.processingjournal.com/assets/favicons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-08-29 21:56:33.133371

The sustainable fuel market has significant potential.
Overcoming these barriers will require coordinated action across the sustainable fuel lifecycle.
The Question of Cost: Financing the Future of Sustainable Fuel The value of sustainable fuel is clear: It delivers cleaner combustion and higher energy density than its fossil equivalent.
However, the price differential between conventional and sustainable fuel in marine1 and aviation2 can be significant.","The race to net zero is on — and sustainable fuel has a critical role to play. With emission targets tightening, aviation and marine organizations are under pressure to reduce fossil fuel reliance, comply with evolving regulations and deliver on ambitious sustainability goals.

The sustainable fuel market has significant potential. Yet the technology and infrastructure required to scale cleaner fuel is in early development and vulnerable to fluctuations in government support. For producers and innovators, securing investment amid regulatory uncertainty is a persistent challenge.

Overcoming these barriers will require coordinated action across the sustainable fuel lifecycle. Insurance and risk solutions are key in this transition. By de-risking investment, protecting against volatility and enabling confidence in long-term planning, they can help unlock the capital and collaboration needed to move forward.

To explore how these challenges play out in practice and what’s needed to overcome them, Aon spoke with two leaders at the forefront of sustainable fuel innovation: Kwame Bekoe, CEO of AfriSAF, and Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet. Their insights offer a real-world view into the barriers facing producers and the opportunities that lie ahead.

At the Source: Upstream Challenges in the Feedstock Industry

The foundation of sustainable fuel’s success lies upstream in the sourcing of feedstock, where risks and opportunities are tightly interwoven. Feedstock refers to the raw biological materials, such as agricultural waste, used cooking oil or energy crops, that are converted into sustainable fuel.

Land use disputes, volatility in feedstock prices and fragmentation in the feedstock supply chain are just some of the challenges facing this industry. Yet innovators like Kwame Bekoe, CEO of AfriSAF, have a keen sense of its potential. His company connects feedstock owners in Africa and buyers via a digital marketplace, reducing agricultural waste, generating new income streams for local farmers and supplying the key ingredient for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

AfriSAF’s ambitions extend beyond aggregation. Plans are underway to build production facilities and export sustainable fuels to global markets. Buy-in from investors and insurers will be essential for these plans to become reality.

One of the biggest problems has been insufficient data. “The smallhold farmers we work with are unbanked and operate in an informal sector,” explains Bekoe. “By integrating these farmers into the formal sector and leveraging satellite, drone and AI-driven data, we can help de-risk agricultural operations and reduce insurance premiums.”

De-Risking the Roots: Insuring Feedstock Resilience

Backed by data, solutions like crop insurance and parametric cover can help stabilize income for smallholders, unlock capital and strengthen resilience across the feedstock supply chain — supporting a more investable and scalable starting point for sustainable fuel.

The Question of Cost: Financing the Future of Sustainable Fuel

The value of sustainable fuel is clear: It delivers cleaner combustion and higher energy density than its fossil equivalent. Its benefits extend beyond marine and aviation as organizations across sectors purchase the Scope 3 reductions as part of their own offsetting measures.

However, the price differential between conventional and sustainable fuel in marine1 and aviation2 can be significant. Subsidies, compliance costs, carbon pricing and private sector investment all play a role, but stakeholders face risk in terms of future revenue certainty and asset depreciation.

Scaling to the level required comes at a cost. “Capital is needed at every stage of development to support sustainable fuel infrastructure,” says Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet, a company that successfully pioneers alcohol-to-jet technology, transforming ethanol into SAF and renewable diesel.

While eight different technology platforms are certified for SAF production, many remain commercially immature. The steady flow of capital needed to advance these technologies is often inconsistent.

Funds like Breakthrough Energy have provided a blueprint for how risk-tolerant capital can accelerate clean energy innovation. But more investment channels must open.

“Some stakeholders will want projects to be fully de-risked before they deploy their capital, but in a new industry, you need investors that are willing to take more of a risk,” explains Samartzis. “We haven’t seen that balance yet, which is why companies like ours have taken on strategic investors who have a longer-term view and other motives for being in the industry.”

Insurance as a Bridge to Innovation Investment

By providing coverage for first-of-its-kind technologies and helping to stabilize risk profiles, insurers can enable early-stage investment and support commercialization. “There’s a real opportunity for the insurance industry to better understand what we’re building and to see the long-term upside,” Samartzis adds.

Shifting Regulations Fuel Uncertainty

Policy frameworks governing emissions, fuel standards and reporting are evolving across regions.

Government mandates and incentive schemes can be effective in encouraging adoption. In its early stages, LanzaJet partnered with the U.S. Department of Energy to receive funding that helped progress its technology. Today, the Ghana-based AfriSAF benefits from government policies designed to increase biofuel use.

Delays, inconsistencies and policy changes can, however, hamper planning — particularly for multinational operators spanning multiple jurisdictions. Weak enforcement mechanisms can undermine investor confidence in expected long-term returns.

For example, at the global level, the International Civil Aviation Organization has set a 5% reduction target for CO2 emissions by 2030,3 while the International Maritime Organization is aiming for net-zero emissions by or around 2050.4 However, regional policy remains fragmented and fragile. Incentives introduced by one administration can be rolled back by the next.

To counter this, governments must design frameworks that are not only ambitious, but also durable. They should:

Establish clear incentives to guide stakeholders toward desired outcomes.

Set enforceable milestones to ensure consistent progress and accountability.

Implement meaningful consequences for inaction to maintain momentum.

Negotiate robust contractual structures that include appropriate penalty and break clauses, offering certainty in case of changes to government policy or regulatory approaches.

Policy Shifts and Protection: Insurance for Regulatory Risk

Insurance can be pivotal in reinforcing confidence. By offering protection against policy-related disruptions or delays, insurers can help stabilize investment conditions and support the long-term development of sustainable fuel infrastructure. As the industry matures, insurance solutions that address regulatory uncertainty will be essential to maintaining momentum.

Insuring a Sustainable Future: From Insight to Action

Working toward universal sustainability will require collaboration among key industry stakeholders, including those producing and buying sustainable fuel. Governmental bodies and investors supporting the progress of the burgeoning industry will also be crucial.

Risk managers and insurance buyers need a new playbook — one that integrates risk insights into commercial and sustainability strategies from the outset. Insurance can be a key enabler throughout the sustainable fuel lifecycle. From crop insurance that supports upstream resilience, to risk transfer solutions that help fuel producers secure funding and coverage that empowers transport operators to adopt new technologies — the right insurance strategy can accelerate progress at every stage. Early engagement with expert insurance and risk advisors can tangibly improve project feasibility, stakeholder alignment and long-term value, turning today’s uncertainty into tomorrow’s competitive edge.

“The agriculture and aviation sectors will be key strategic partners in the production of SAF, especially in the Americas, enabling our region to become a global hub for SAF production”, he concluded.","Rosario, Argentina, 28 August 2025 (IICA) – A declaration by the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA) on the development and promotion of sustainable aviation fuels in the Americas was presented during the Pan American Liquid Biofuels Summit in Rosario, Argentina.

Among the signatories of the Declaration led by IICA are the Latin American Civil Aviation Commission (LACAC), the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the Latin American and Caribbean Air Transport Association (ALTA), the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE) and the Pan American Liquid Biofuels Coalition (CPBIO).

IICA, as an international organization specializing in agricultural and rural development in the Americas, and CPBIO, created by IICA in 2023 and comprised of the main biofuel producers’ associations and their value chains, acknowledge the transformative potential of sustainable agriculture in supplying feedstocks for the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

The two entities promote the sustainable development of liquid biofuels as a key tool for decarbonizing the transport sector, and have identified SAF as one of the main strategic opportunities to integrate agricultural and energy value chains and the regional aviation sector.

The aviation sector is facing the urgent challenge of reducing net carbon dioxide emissions from its operations, in accordance with the Long-Term Aspirational Goal (LTAG) adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) at its Forty-first Assembly, which establishes net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 as a global target.

Across the Americas, there is recognition of the fact that SAF, complemented by technological and operational improvements and carbon offsets, affords a strategic means for achieving the decarbonization goals established by the international community.

The harmonized positions in favor of SAF development, regulation and implementation in Latin America and the Caribbean have been adopted within the framework of LACAC’s mandate to promote regulatory harmonization and technical cooperation among countries in the region, as set forth in Resolution A24-03, which urges the establishment of public policies to incentivize SAF production and use, in keeping with the sustainability criteria adopted by the ICAO Council.

The Joint Declaration announced in Rosario by IICA, CPBIO, LACAC, IATA, ALTA, and OLADE presents a roadmap for coordinated regional action in relation to SAF, with special emphasis on capacity building, infrastructure development, regulatory frameworks and financial mechanisms.

Five points to foster SAF development in the Americas

Following an almost year-long debate process, the aforementioned signatories agreed on the content of the Fourth CPBIO Declaration, which focuses on SAF and consists of five key points:

First, to support and encourage Member States to adopt, develop, and strengthen harmonized regulatory frameworks in accordance with ICAO and LACAC guidelines, to facilitate the establishment of a robust, transparent and competitive SAF market, including certification mechanisms grounded in science, mutual recognition of standards, and technology neutrality.

Second, to support the design and implementation of national and intergovernmental public policies aimed at fostering sustainable SAF production and use, including fiscal incentives, concessional financing, risk mitigation mechanisms for infrastructure investments, subsidy schemes and differentiated pricing.

Third, to reaffirm the need to build sustainable value chains that integrate the agriculture sector, biofuel industry and aviation sector, while also ensuring the supply of certified feedstock, upholding social and environmental justice principles, and strengthening rural economies across the region.

Fourth, to acknowledge the urgent need to mobilize financial resources through the establishment of a multilateral fund for SAF capacity building and production, with the involvement of multilateral credit institutions, regional development banks, international climate funds and public-private partnerships.

Lastly, to commit to fostering close collaboration among the signatories of this Declaration and other relevant national, regional and international organizations in the development of roadmaps for SAF production and use, as well as in the collection of data, assessment of feedstock potential, impact analysis, and technical support for policy formulation.

The signatories reaffirm that SAF development, through inter-governmental cooperation and collaboration, affords a strategic opportunity to simultaneously advance the environmental sustainability goals of the aviation sector and the productive transformation of the agriculture and energy sectors.

Both IICA and CPBIO consider that cooperation and collaboration among governments, producers and the private sector will be key to facilitating a smooth, equitable and effective transition towards a net-zero carbon future for air transportation in the Americas.

According to Agustín Torroba, IICA Biofuel Specialist and Executive Secretary of CPBIO, SAF are the aviation sector’s best bet for meeting its climate commitments.

“The agriculture and aviation sectors will be key strategic partners in the production of SAF, especially in the Americas, enabling our region to become a global hub for SAF production”, he concluded.

St1 Nordic -konsernin vuoden 2025 ensimmäisen vuosipuoliskon liikevaihto oli 3,5 miljardia euroa, joka on noin 0,6 miljardia euroa vähemmän kuin edellisvuonna vastaavaan aikaan. Liikevaihdon pieneneminen johtui öljytuotteiden matalammasta hintatasosta sekä Göteborgin öljynjalostamollamme tehdystä osittaisesta huoltoseisokista. Vähittäismyyntimarkkinalla volyymit laskivat hiukan, kun taas laivaliikenteen polttoaineiden volyymit kasvoivat merkittävästi. Liikevaihdon maakohtainen jakauma säilyi aiempien vuosien kaltaisena, ja 20 % liikevaihdosta tuli Suomesta, 52 % Ruotsista, 27 % Norjasta ja vajaa 1 % Iso-Britanniasta.

Liikevoitto jäi -5,3 miljoonaan euroon, joka oli 153,7 miljoonaa euroa vähemmän kuin edellisvuonna. Tulos verojen jälkeen oli -3,4 miljoonaa euroa, kun edellisvuoden tulos oli 116,4 miljoonaa euroa. Jalostusmarginaali toteutui huomattavasti viime vuotta alhaisempana johtuen pääasiassa markkinatilanteesta mutta myös osittaisesta huoltoseisokista öljynjalostamollamme. Varasto- ja arvostuserät vaikuttivat tulokseen negatiivisesti tämän vuoden ensimmäisellä puoliskolla, kun vaikutus oli positiivinen vertailukaudella. Uusiutuvan dieselin ja lentopolttoaineen markkinoilla oli alkuvuonna ylitarjontaa. Näkymät eri markkinoilla ovat loppuvuodelle huomattavasti positiivisemmat.

Liiketoiminnan rahavirta oli 137,4 miljoonaa euroa. Investoinnit olivat yhteensä 117,3 miljoonaa euroa. Suurimmat investoinnit kohdistuivat jalostamomme osittaiseen huoltoseisokkiin, Shell-brändätyn asemaverkostomme muuttamiseen St1-brändiin St1:n yhden brändin strategian mukaisesti sekä uusiin sähkölatauspisteisiin verkostossamme. Lisäksi St1 sijoitti fuusioenergiaa kehittävään Novatron Fusion Groupiin.

Konsernin oma pääoma oli kauden lopussa vahva, 1369,0 miljoonaa euroa, ja omavaraisuusaste 54,9. St1 Nordic Oy:n yhtiökokous valtuutti hallituksen hankkimaan yhtiön omia osakkeita ja hallitus päätti hankkia tarjotut 219 420 osaketta.

Henrikki Talvitie, St1 Nordic Oy:n toimitusjohtaja:

Vuoden ensimmäisellä puoliskolla jatkoimme merkittävien energiasiirtymähankkeidemme edistämistä, mukaan lukien siirtymäinvestoinnit Göteborgin öljynjalostamollamme sekä Biorefinery Östrand -hankkeeseen Ruotsissa. Jälkimmäinen on merkittävin vähäpäästöisten polttoaineiden kehityshankkeemme, joka on käynnistetty yhteistyössä SCA:n kanssa. Jatkoimme myös energiasiirtymän tiekarttamme kehittämistä, minkä ensisijaisena tavoitteena on kasvattaa vähäpäästöisten energiamuotojen portfoliotamme.

Investoinnit pohjoismaiseen asemaverkostoomme

Yhden brändin strategiamme siirtyi toteutusvaiheeseen huhtikuussa, kun aloitimme vähittäismyyntitoimintojemme yhdistämisen St1-brändin alle Pohjoismaissa. St1:n yhden brändin strategia sisältää noin 630 Shell-brändätyn asemamme uudelleenbrändäyksen St1-asemiksi. Vuoden loppuun mennessä kaikki 1 250 St1-asemaamme muodostavat yhtenäisen pohjoismaisen energian jakeluverkoston. Investointi tukee energiasiirtymätiekarttaamme ja vahvistaa kykyämme tuoda asiakkaillemme yhä enemmän vähäpäästöisempiä energiatuotteita.

Vuoden ensimmäisellä puoliskolla jatkoimme sähköautojen latauksen ja biokaasun jakelun laajentamista. Avasimme 36 uutta sähköautojen latauspistettä, ja latausmahdollisuus on nyt tarjolla jo 175 asemallamme Suomessa, Norjassa ja Ruotsissa. Vahvistimme nesteytetyn biokaasun (LBG) jakeluverkostoamme 4 uudella asemalla Suomessa ja Ruotsissa. Ensimmäinen ensisijaisesti sähköautoilijoita palveleva energia-asemamme avattiin Oslossa, Norjassa – tarjoten sähköautojen latausta, autopesun ja myymälän.

Vähäpäästöisen energiaportfoliomme vahvistaminen

Helmikuussa solmimme strategisen, pitkäaikaisen kumppanuuden Novatron Fusion Groupin (NFG) kanssa kaupallisen fuusioenergian kehityksen vauhdittamiseksi. Yhteistyön tavoitteena on vähentää yhteiskunnan riippuvuutta fossiilisista polttoaineista ja vastata tulevaisuuden energiatarpeisiin. St1 toimii pääsijoittajana ja uutena hallituksen jäsenenä sijoitettuaan 13 miljoonaa euroa NFG:hen, tarjoten pitkäaikaista arvoa sekä liiketoiminta-, teollisuus- ja regulaatio-osaamista.

Ensimmäinen aurinkopuistomme Risholmenissa, Göteborgissa, alkoi tuottaa sähköä verkkoon kesäkuussa. Puistossa on 15 777 aurinkopaneelia, ja se tuottaa arviolta 8,5 GWh vuodessa, mikä vastaa noin 3 500 kotitalouden sähkönkulutusta.

Energiasiirtymä on edelleen tärkein vastuullisuusteemamme. Vastuullisen kasvun edistämiseksi luotamme tieteeseen, datalähtöiseen johtamiseen, ketteryyteen ja kustannustehokkuuteen keskeisinä mahdollistajina. Jatkamme investointeja ja osaamisemme vahvistamista tällä alueella.

Recently, the company announced record second-quarter earnings and raised its revenue forecast for fiscal 2026. AI systems are now key to its growth and climate goals.

Dell’s AI Servers Drive a Big Revenue Jump

In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, Dell saw rapid growth in its AI sector. Revenue reached a record $29.8 billion, up 19% from last year. Operating income rose to $1.8 billion, a 27% increase. Earnings per share jumped 38% to $1.70, with adjusted EPS hitting a record $2.32.

The standout? AI servers. Built on NVIDIA chips, these systems drove a 44% revenue increase in Dell’s Infrastructure Solutions Group. Sales of servers and networking soared 69% to $12.9 billion. The company shipped $8.2 billion in AI systems, secured $5.6 billion in new orders, and ended the quarter with an $11.7 billion backlog.

This momentum led Dell to raise its AI server sales outlook to $20 billion for fiscal 2026, a 33% increase. The total expected annual revenue is now between $105 billion and $ 109 billion, a 12% increase from last year.

PCs Lag as Enterprise Demand Surges

While AI boosted Dell’s growth, the PC segment lagged. Sales grew only 1%, mainly due to corporate upgrades as support for Windows 10 ends in October. This weak outlook impacted Dell’s near-term forecast, with Q3 EPS projected at $2.45, which fell short of Wall Street’s expectations. Shares dropped nearly 5% after hours.

Even so, a clear trend is emerging. PCs may grow slowly, but enterprise spending on AI and cloud infrastructure is reshaping Dell’s growth story.

The Sustainability Thread in Dell’s Growth

Dell is aligning its growth with climate goals. The company uses circular economy principles in its supply chain and customer relationships. It aims to reduce waste, enhance resource efficiency, and cut emissions throughout its product lifecycle.

Dell has pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across its value chain. Its 2030 goals focus on energy efficiency, renewable power, and responsible sourcing. This shows Dell’s belief that technology can help drive a low-carbon economy.

Tackling Energy and Emissions

Its sustainability report says that Dell targets Scope 1 emissions, including fuel use from corporate jets and vehicles. The company plans to switch to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and work with providers to expand access.

For its fleet, Dell is optimizing vehicle types and numbers while adding more electric options. Electrifying its fleet may raise electricity demand (and Scope 2 emissions), but Dell is balancing this by speeding up its renewable energy transition.

Like many tech firms, Dell’s Scope 2 emissions—from purchased electricity—make up most of its footprint. To address this, Dell invests in renewable power through virtual power purchase agreements (vPPAs), joint PPAs, and renewable energy credits. It is also exploring new on-site solar projects to lessen grid reliance.

It is making significant efficiency improvements in its labs and data centers, where much electricity is consumed. These sites power the servers driving AI growth, making energy efficiency vital for operations and climate goals.

Dell is also tackling Scope 3 emissions throughout its value chain, focusing on two areas: purchased goods and customer product use. Separate targets address both areas.

As it moves toward its 2030 goals, other Scope 3 categories will account for a larger share of emissions. While Categories 1 and 11 are priorities, Dell monitors all Scope 3 sources for meaningful reductions.

The Role of Carbon Credits in Dell’s Net Zero Goals

Dell knows some emissions will remain, even with aggressive decarbonization. The company plans to offset no more than 10% of its baseline emissions with carbon removals, following best practices from the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM).

Currently, Dell is not engaging in large-scale carbon removals, focusing instead on its near-term 2030 decarbonization efforts. As technologies improve, Dell plans to acquire high-quality credits and removals to meet its net-zero target.

Building a Just Transition

Dell insists that the move to net zero must be fair. The company commits to sourcing renewable power only from projects that do not harm underserved communities. It integrates social responsibility into its supplier code, ensuring human rights and fair labor practices.

As a founding member of the Responsible Business Alliance, Dell requires suppliers to commit to decarbonization and respect for vulnerable workers. This involvement ensures its climate ambitions reach throughout its value chain.

Climate Resilience Through Digital Access

Dell views technology access as crucial for climate resilience. Its Solar Community Hub program offers solar-powered internet and computer access to underserved communities worldwide. By promoting digital inclusion, Dell aims to impact one billion lives by 2030, broadening the benefits of the clean energy transition.

Investors Ask: What’s Next?

With its stock outperforming the market this year, investors wonder about Dell’s next steps. According to experts, the answer likely lies in two areas:

Earnings trajectory – Analysts will watch if Dell can sustain its AI-driven growth amid weaker PC demand and margin pressures.

Sustainability execution – Stakeholders want Dell to show that its booming AI server business can grow without sacrificing climate commitments.

Dell’s guidance of $105–109 billion in annual revenue and $20 billion in AI server sales reflects confidence in growth and demand. Its detailed climate strategy indicates that Dell recognizes investors and customers want progress on emissions, not just profits.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/shutterstock_2313072843.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 13:56:26.488947

The Ground Vibration Test procedure

Deutsche Aircraft stated that the achievement is a significant step forward in the Uplift programme, which is funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy. The initiative is to accelerate the maturation of new technologies for sustainable aviation, which will boost the German innovative and economic value.

Ground vibration test is a procedure in aircraft development that determines the aircraft’s modal properties, including its natural frequencies, mode shapes, and damping ratios. According to the German aircraft manufacturer, ground vibration testing is essential information for validating structural dynamics and the refinement of numerical models used in flutter analysis and loads calculation.

During the test, the D328 Uplift was suspended with controlled air springs, and electrodynamic shakers were used on the structure, with 237 acceleration sensors capturing the dynamic response of the aircraft. The test period lasted over two weeks, and excitation occurred at more than 20 locations. The test outcome included three aircraft configurations, 45 hours of excitation time, and 50 distinct eigenforms identified.

Deutsche Aircraft gave thanks to the teams involved in the test, especially its partners at DLR. The company stated that the successful completion of the test marks a powerful demonstration of the possibilities when industry and applied research are in sync.

President Trump’s ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill’ Puts Oklahoma Agriculture First

By Senator Markwayne Mullin

“As a lifelong cow-calf rancher, I know firsthand the difficulties our farmers and ranchers face every day. Burdensome regulations, disease, recent natural disasters, and growing costs are just some of the challenges posed to farmers across the country. Agriculture is a way of life in Oklahoma and I’m proud to represent generations of family farms and ranches that work tirelessly to feed, fuel, and clothe our great nation.

With President Trump back in the White House and Secretary Brooke Rollins leading the way at the Department of Agriculture, America’s farmers and ranchers are receiving unprecedented levels of support. Signed into law in July, the ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill’ secured huge wins for the Ag community and jumpstarted the support needed for our farms and ranches to thrive. The OBBB strengthens the farm safety net and provides longer-term certainty for farmers and ranchers.

For starters, we are making crop insurance more affordable for producers by redefining USDA’s experience threshold definition from five to ten years and extending coverage through 2031, allowing more producers to qualify for assistance over a longer period of time. The community will also see an extension of the 45Z clean transportation fuel production credit for Oklahoma feedstock and sustainable aviation fuel producers through 2029.

The OBBB also invests $60 million in scholarship support for students at 1890 land-grant universities serving historically black universities, including our very own Langston University in Oklahoma.

In recent years, disease has hit the Ag community hard. This bill provides $233 million annually, starting in 2026, to the National Animal Disease Preparedness, Detection, and Vaccine Bank Programs to protect cattle health in Oklahoma and across the nation from foreign animal disease outbreaks.

With the OBBB also codifying the Small Business tax deduction, farmers will save more of their hard-earned money by being able to deduct 20% of their business income. I am also proud to say that we are preserving family farms by codifying the Death Estate Tax exemption threshold at $15 million per individual and $30 million per couple, adjusted annually for inflation, to allow farmers who have spent generations building their operations to pass them down to their children and grandchildren.

IBA NetZero modelling indicates that the average implied fuel cost (1) for European airline operations (intra-European flights) stood at approximately €760 per metric tonne in 2024, increasing by an expected 9% in 2025 and 30% in 2030. This escalation reflects the cumulative impact of policies applied within Europe (note, Europe, not just the EU). While these initiatives are designed to accelerate decarbonisation, they also create a cost disparity compared to other regions, where such obligations remain limited.

(1) Implied fuel cost – the average cost of fuel at European airports, including Jet A, SAF blends and emissions policies

This disparity is already altering competitive dynamics. For example, Deloitte’s Airlines for Europe (A4E) analysis shows that on long-haul routes such as Nice-Tokyo with a routing via non-EU hubs like Istanbul (NCE-IST-HND) are shown to be 9.4% cheaper in 2024, before ReFuelEU kicks in, and 15.0% cheaper in 2030 with forecast ReFuelEU, EU ETS, and CORSIA costs.

Policies are already altering competitive dynamics. The cost advantage leads to notable market distortion. Under the ReFuelEU 2030 scenario for the NCE-HND route, Deloitte estimates 65% of business (passenger) leakage from operators with EU hubs to operators with non-EU competitors, corresponding to a carbon leakage of 26%. In other words, most passengers lost by EU carriers are captured by non-EU airlines, while over a quarter of the climate benefit is cancelled out as emissions are displaced or increased rather than reduced. The emissions are shifting beyond the EU’s regulatory scope through behaviours such as hub-switching, additional layovers, and destination changes to limit policy exposure. This may undermine both environmental outcomes and the competitiveness of European carriers, without corrective action.

Addressing this challenge requires further policy adaptation. The introduction of a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Border Adjustment Mechanism (SAF-BAM) is proposed, designed to apply an equivalent SAF cost to itineraries that bypass EU requirements through non-EU connections. Modelling suggests this measure could improve total demand changes for operators with EU hubs from -2.9% to -0.6% by 2030, significantly limiting carbon leakage. While not a bullet-proof solution, SAF-BAM represents a targeted improvement to maintain competitive balance and climate ambition.

The SAF-BAM proposal is similar to the EU CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism), a tariff set up in conjunction with the EU ETS to maintain the competitiveness of EU industries against imports that are not subject to direct EU carbon taxes. However, CBAM does not apply to aviation, hence the call from many for an expanded EU ETS to cover international flights to/from the EU.

Complementary measures, such as SAF cost incentives and broader international cooperation, will be critical to ensuring that Europe’s leadership in sustainable aviation delivers genuine global benefits rather than displacing emissions geographically.

Europe’s regulatory framework is reshaping airline costs and travel patterns. Without agile corrective mechanisms and bold ambition, these policies risk exporting traffic and emissions, diminishing their environmental benefit. This industry needs pragmatic steps that align decarbonisation objectives with the realities of a global aviation market.

We update our global and South African scenarios annually to inform internal strategy processes and decision- making. We leverage national and international scenario databases to create and review a balanced but challenging set of global and South African scenarios annually to inform internal strategy processes and decision-making. International references include: Including the International Energy Agency (IEA), South African Petroleum Industry Association (SAPIA), Shell, bp, Oxford Economics, World Energy Council, S&P Global, Wood Mackenzie, Rystad, International Air Transport Association (IATA), the International Council for Clean Transport (ICCT), BloombergNEF, World Economic Forum (WEF), International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), the World Bank and Statistics South Africa (StatsSA).

Updates to our scenarios focused on revisions to the short to medium term globally and locally. Global economic outlook has been updated to reflect recent short- to medium term developments, potential trade or tariff wars, geopolitical uncertainties, investment, productivity dynamics and revised data.

It should be noted that scenarios are not predictions or forecasts, but rather tools to assist in managing Sasol’s responses to future uncertainty.

Scenarios are hypotheses of the future, informed by data from various sources, constructed using models and contain insights from experts in relevant fields. All scenarios should preferably be read together as representing a complete picture of the future, told along different storylines. It is unlikely that a single scenario will materialise on its own.

By Sheersh Kapoor

At Reliance Industries’ 48th Annual General Meeting, Executive Director Anant Ambani called the company’s New Energy business its most “ambitious and transformational mission of this decade,” saying it had moved “from ambition to execution.”

Congratulating the entire leadership team of RIL’s Energy Business for their operational excellence in challenging times, Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani said he was confident they would “set global benchmarks in executing all their projects, making New Energy a large growth engine for Reliance.”

At Jamnagar, the Dhirubhai Ambani Giga Energy Complex is being built at record pace, with over 5 million manhours of engineering, 44 million square feet of building area – four times Tesla’s Gigafactory – and 7 lakh tonnes of steel, equal to 100 Eiffel Towers. It also involves 1 lakh kilometres of cable, enough to reach the moon and back.

“We are building the world’s most integrated New Energy ecosystem – from sand to electrons to green molecules – at a scale unmatched anywhere in the world,” Anant Ambani said. Products from the giga factories will deliver round-the-clock renewable power and produce green fuels such as ammonia, e-methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.

Reliance has already produced its first 200 MW of HJT solar modules, which provide 10% higher energy yield, 20% better temperature performance, and 25% lower degradation. This platform will scale up to 20 GWp, making it the world’s largest and most integrated single-site solar facility.

A battery giga factory, starting in 2026, will expand from 40 GWh to 100 GWh annually, while an electrolyser giga factory, also due by 2026, will scale up to 3 GW to enable cost-competitive green hydrogen production.

Together, these platforms create a solar, battery storage, and hydrogen ecosystem under one roof, giving Reliance a competitive edge in technology, cost, and supply chain resilience.

In Gujarat’s Kutch, the company is building one of the world’s largest single-site solar projects across 5,50,000 acres, capable of meeting 10% of India’s electricity demand within the decade.

Reliance also plans to produce and export green ammonia, methanol, and aviation fuel, targeting 3 MMTPA of green hydrogen equivalent capacity by 2032.

“Jamnagar will be the cradle of both the world’s largest Conventional Energy complex and the world’s largest New Energy complex. Jamnagar is the face of New Reliance and New India,” Ambani told shareholders.

About sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) SAF is a blended drop in fuel, certified against aviation fuel technical standards.","An Air France Airbus A220 on Aug. 25 completed its delivery flight from Airbus’ site in Mirabel to Paris powered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

This marked a significant step forward: Airbus in Canada directly issued official sustainability credentials for SAF to a customer for the first time.

This landmark flight not only confirms Airbus' capability to provide proofs of sustainability (PoS) directly to customers and operators but also supports the industry's commitment to decarbonisation. With PoS credits for a 50% SAF blend applied through the mass balance process, this ferry flight conducted by Air France's 46th A220-300 named “VAISON-LA-ROMAINE”, represented more than 25 metric tons reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to fossil fuels.

“Fleet renewal and the use of sustainable aviation fuel are the two main levers of the decarbonization of aviation. Combining the two is only logical and Air France-KLM is proud to participate in this Airbus milestone with the delivery flight of one of our A220s. Air France-KLM is among the world’s largest buyers of SAF. Directly receiving SAF at delivery is a game-changer, increasing transparency and driving industry progress,” said Blaise Brigaud, SVP Group Sustainability, Air France-KLM.

Since the announcement of the first sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) delivery at Airbus site in Canada, enabling the Mirabel teams to use SAF for A220 production, customer acceptance, and test flights, this achievement solidifies Airbus' commitment to using SAF for internal operations as well as customer ferry flights across all its commercial aircraft assembly sites and delivery centers worldwide.

""In 2025 alone, we project cutting CO2 emissions by approximately 400 metric tonnes at our Mirabel site thanks to the 170,000 litres of pure SAF we will integrate to our activities,"" said Benoît Schultz, CEO of Airbus Canada. ""And we're pushing our ambition further with this ferry flight with PoS credits for 50% SAF – a significant step that comes just ahead of Air France’s 50th A220 delivery later this year. On a global scale, 78% of Airbus aircraft were delivered with SAF blend for the first half of the year, underscoring the importance our customers place on decarbonization.""

As with all Airbus aircraft, the A220 is already capable of operating with up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Airbus aims for all its aircraft to be capable of operating with up to 100% SAF by 2030. According to the PoS under CORSIA Sustainability Certification Scheme approved by ICAO, the SAF received at Airbus in Mirabel is certified for 85% reduction in GHG emissions on its lifecycle compared to fossil fuel. This substantial reduction is crucial to the aerospace industry’s progress towards decarbonization by 2050.

SAF management in Mirabel is done using mass balance, a chain of custody model in which a company accounts for volumes of certified products by looking at the volumes entering the operation and the equivalent volume of products leaving the operations as a measurement, minus any processing losses. As such, the SAF is blended with conventional aviation fuel (Jet A-1) as per established industry standards and auditable bookkeeping.

Air France’s first A220-300s, part of a total firm order of 60 aircraft, have been flying on its medium-haul network since October 2021. The A220 delivers up to 25% lower fuel burn and CO2 emissions per seat compared to previous generation aircraft. For more information on the A220 Programme, visit our A220 dedicated page.

About sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)

SAF is a blended drop in fuel, certified against aviation fuel technical standards. It is a blend of a synthetic component made from renewable feedstocks and conventional fossil fuel. This blend, up to 50%, has the same characteristics as aviation fuels and are certified as such (e.g. Jet A/A1 (ASTM), Number 3 Jet Fuel (China), TS1 (Russia)).

As it is a drop in fuel, it does not require any change to the engines nor to the aircraft and its uptake and combustion has no impact on the safety of operations nor on maintenance tasks.

To be certified as ""sustainable"", the synthetic blend component must comply with sustainability standards, including minimum Green House Gas (GHG) savings. Hence, the GHG savings on a Life Cycle Assessment basis is only accounted for the synthetic blend component - and not for the conventional fossil fuel. Sustainability criteria is defined by regulations like ICAO CORSIA, EU RED, and UK SAF Mandate.

International demand has been primarily driven by record inbound tourism, and the airline's domestic traffic picture remains strong. Several product-driven upgrades on long-haul aircraft (including new premium cabins) have been coupled with the expansion of the ZIPAIR Tokyo network, giving the airline additional coverage of both the top and bottom of the market.

The airline's cargo revenue picture is weaker than its pandemic peaks, but the carrier continues to generate revenue in unique ways, such as through a joint venture with Yamato Holdings. The airline's seemingly bullish growth picture does have some notable risks, primarily volatility in the yen and jet fuel prices, alongside increased regulatory scrutiny regarding Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandates.

Company Specific Growth Catalysts

The airline continues to replace older long-haul aircraft with the Airbus A350-1000 on many flagship routes, and it will add the jet to its service from Tokyo Haneda Airport (HND) to Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG). These jets feature upgraded premium cabins and will help build the airline's pricing power in this critical market saturated with business travelers.

The airline has further plans to deploy the Airbus A350-1000 on many routes to key US cities, such as New York, Dallas, and Los Angeles. A rise in capacity on seasonal routes will further help the airline expand its reach and develop a brand that generates passenger loyalty. The carrier's low-cost subsidiary, ZIPAIR, has also continued to grow its network, giving the airline an even broader reach within the market.

Macroeconomic Risks To Growth

Macroeconomic headwinds and tailwinds will have a major impact on Japan Airlines' growth prospects in the second half of the year. Inbound travel demand remains strong, primarily targeted by high inbound loads. The biggest confounding variable for the carrier at this point is the Yen, which has seen devaluations in recent years. Increases in the value of the yen over the next two quarters could lead to a decline in inbound tourist demand to Japan. However, a weaker yen could lead to lower business travel and outbound tourism.

Jet fuel, which remains any airline's largest variable cost and one over which it has somewhat minimal control, is also a concern for Japan Airlines. Most industry observers anticipate softer fuel prices throughout the second half of 2025, but any increase in prices could harm the airline's finances, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

Japan also has a roadmap to the full-scale adoption of SAF, with a 10% blending mandate currently on the books for 2030, despite higher unit costs and supply-side cost pressures. Nonetheless, as long as the airline can continue servicing robust inbound demand and commanding a price premium in key markets, it should be in decent shape to overcome some of these concerning macroeconomic hurdles.

What Is The Bottom Line?

Investors, despite these potential risks, do appear to have confidence in the airline's prospects in the second half of the year. The airline's stock has provided investors with dynamic returns exceeding 25% over the past calendar year, mostly driven by waves of macroeconomic tailwinds.

Analysts Forecast a Big Move in CVX Stock Chevron stock is up about 10% in 2025.
It’s also a little deceptive because of the spike in CVX stock since early April.
Chevron stock formed a death cross on August 20.
The analyst firm reiterated its Overweight rating on CVX stock and raised its price target to $197 from $186.","Concerns about inflation still dominate this market. In April and May, the immediate concern was that the Trump administration's tariff policy would cause a sharp spike in inflation. That hasn’t been the case, although some companies, particularly retailers, continue to report tariff headwinds.

However, the current concerns about inflation center around interest rates. The CME FedWatch tool puts the chance of a 25-basis point rate cut in September at around 87%. However, lower interest rates have a stimulative effect on the economy. That means that inflation will almost certainly increase, including for commodities like oil that have been in check so far in 2025.

That’s good news for a blue-chip stock like Chevron Corp. CVX. Here’s another reason. Dividend growth stocks are one of the only investments that give investors an opportunity to keep up with inflation.

Chevron has increased its dividend for 38 consecutive years, putting it in the exclusive category known as dividend aristocrats. However, the company also has a strong track record of delivering share buybacks to shareholders. In the company’s second quarter, Chevron delivered $5.5 billion to shareholders between dividends and buybacks.

Not a Contrarian Play

Energy stocks, particularly oil stocks, have been under pressure for much of the year. The problem with oil has been that companies like Chevron have increased their output for the last 12 months, and the market is well supplied. Plus, investors are concerned that alternative energy still represents an existential threat to oil and gas companies.

Lower interest rates may not immediately spark demand. However, if manufacturing and industrial output increase, that will be bullish for crude. Plus, if consumers get relief in time for the holiday season, it could spark a slight revival in transports, which would also be bullish for oil.

The alternative energy threat is really a win-win situation for Chevron. First, it will be years and more likely decades before the world has enough renewable energy sources to make oil less relevant. Until then, Chevron and other oil companies remain essential for economic growth.

At the same time, Chevron hasn’t been ignoring the alternative energy market. The company continues to spend billions on low-carbon initiatives, including:

Renewable fuels – Chevron is one of the largest producers of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel in the U.S. It has joint ventures, including with Bunge, to expand feedstock processing and distribution.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) – The company is developing CCS projects in California and the U.S. Gulf Coast, with the goal of storing millions of metric tons of CO₂ per year.

Hydrogen – Chevron is building out hydrogen fueling infrastructure in California and exploring opportunities in heavy-duty transport.

Renewable natural gas (RNG) – Through partnerships with agricultural operators, Chevron is converting methane from dairy farms into renewable gas for transportation.

Analysts Forecast a Big Move in CVX Stock

Chevron stock is up about 10% in 2025. That approximates its three-year average total return of around 8.8%. It also points to the range-bound conditions that have been in place for Chevron during that time. It’s also a little deceptive because of the spike in CVX stock since early April.

Chevron stock formed a death cross on August 20. However, the stock is stabilizing, and the pattern could be reversed quickly. The bullish sentiment is shared by UBS Group. The analyst firm reiterated its Overweight rating on CVX stock and raised its price target to $197 from $186. That’s an approximate gain of 20% from its consensus price target of $163.95.

The company won’t report earnings until early November. However, it could get a catalyst in the waning days of August. That’s when Chevron expects to receive the final ruling regarding the arbitration over Exxon Mobil’s claims to preemptive rights in the Staebroek block in Guyana. This arbitration was sparked after Chevron announced its merger with Hess, which was finalized in July.

,,2025-08-29 08:06:24+00:00,CBC,Investing in biofuel could help Canadian canola producers struggling with tariffs | CBC News,"Sam Maciag, CBC News",,,,,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/canola-biofuel-option-1.7619401,"Fred Ghatala, president of Advanced Biofuels Canada, said biofuels are a great way to make better domestic use of Canadian canola.
The Canadian canola industry has been upended by international trade wars.
The change to a producer-based system essentially eliminated eligibility for Canadian biodiesel and renewable diesel in the U.S., which reduces demand for Canadian feedstock like canola oil.
The 265-million-litre canola biodiesel plant opened in 2013 at the site of ADM's already-existing canola crushing facility.
He was stunned to learn the majority of Saskatchewan canola gets exported out of the country.","As Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe plans a trade mission to China to address recent tariffs the country imposed on Canadian canola exports, some of those impacted are eyeing up homegrown solutions.

Fred Ghatala, president of Advanced Biofuels Canada, said biofuels are a great way to make better domestic use of Canadian canola. Those fuels include biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

""When you produce the fuels close to home, the economic value stays in the local economy. It's one of the best solutions to lower emissions [and] increase economic activity, while really not requiring people to change the way they operate,"" he said.

The Canadian canola industry has been upended by international trade wars. On Aug. 14, China imposed a provisional duty rate of 75.8 per cent on canola seed, on top of the 100 per cent tariff levied on Canadian canola oil and meal in March.

The new anti-dumping duty marked another escalation in the yearlong trade dispute that started when Canada imposed 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese-produced electric vehicles in August 2024.

It's a big deal for Canada — particularly for Saskatchewan. According to the Canola Council of Canada, growers produced 17.8 million metric tonnes of canola in 2024, with 55 per cent of that coming from Saskatchewan.

China is Canada's second-biggest canola export market behind the United States, to the tune of $4.9 billion last year.

Right now, the fuel standard policies around using canola oil are different across the country, which means some provinces are using a lot more than others. Ghatala said he sees it as an opportunity and pointed to British Columbia as doing the best, with 31 per cent renewable content in its diesel.

Saskatchewan has a renewable fuel standard that requires at least two per cent of the diesel mix to be renewable. Right now, about 2.5 per cent of the mix is renewable. When it comes to renewables in gasoline, Saskatchewan is doing even better at nearly 10 per cent, surpassing the provincial goal of 7.5 per cent.

Ghatala said the opportunities to use even more domestic canola oil would improve with access to biofuel refineries. But that takes investment — and he said investors need to know the government would support biofuel with policies that increase renewable fuel standard requirements.

Ghatala said Canadian plants are also competing with imported fuel from the United States. In January, the clean fuel production credit replaced the bio-diesel blenders credit. It offers varying amounts of credits based on fuel types and emission reduction. The eligibility is limited to U.S.-produced fuels, meaning producers in the States can sell their products for cheaper.

The change to a producer-based system essentially eliminated eligibility for Canadian biodiesel and renewable diesel in the U.S., which reduces demand for Canadian feedstock like canola oil.

""We don't have anything equivalent in Canada,"" Ghatala said, adding he'd like to see a competitive playing field.

In Canada, renewable diesel is being produced in B.C., Alberta and Newfoundland. Biodiesel is being produced in B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec.

Saskatchewan primarily provides canola feedstock that is turned into biodiesel and is exported to foreign markets where it can also be turned into renewable fuels.

The closest biofuel processing facility to Saskatchewan is operated by ADM, just across the Alberta border in Lloydminster. The 265-million-litre canola biodiesel plant opened in 2013 at the site of ADM's already-existing canola crushing facility.

The need for these kinds of facilities is why Josh Gustafson has added president and CEO to his title of farmer. He's behind Covenant Energy, which is in the process of building a $900-million renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel refinery in Lloydminster.

Gustafson farms near Macoun, in southeastern Saskatchewan. On his 14,000-acre farm, he grows red lentils, canola, durum and barley.

He was stunned to learn the majority of Saskatchewan canola gets exported out of the country.

""The desire to build [the plant] came out of seeing the need for domestic processing in Canada with our own homegrown canola,"" he said.

""It's an extensive refining process,"" he said, noting that it is expensive, and will also require precious critical minerals — something Saskatchewan is also trying to find a market for.

The Covenant plant is still in its engineering phase. Gustafson is expecting it to be operational by 2029.

It's something that could already be in progress in the province.

But in January, Federated Co-operatives Limited paused the construction of its own biodiesel and canola crushing project in Regina ""due to regulatory and political uncertainty, potential shifts in low-carbon public policy and escalating costs.""

Ghalta said without production capacity, the renewable fuel policies won't endure. In short, they need each other. The plant needs the incentives to compete and produce, and the production needs to happen to keep the policies viable and consumers engaged. Ghatala said if one drops off, so could support and investment.

Positive outcomes—such as progress on 737 MAX certification or a resolution to the labor strike—could catalyze further outperformance.
Boeing’s $618.54 billion backlog and strategic focus on sustainable aviation fuel partnerships by 2030 [1] offer long-term growth potential.","Boeing’s Q2 2025 earnings report marked a pivotal moment in its long-awaited turnaround. Revenue surged 34.9% year-over-year to $22.7 billion, driven by a 81% increase in Commercial Airplane segment revenue to $10.87 billion and a 10% rise in Defense, Space & Security (BDS) revenue to $6.62 billion [1]. The company’s net loss narrowed to $612 million, a 63% reduction compared to the same period in 2024 [2]. These figures suggest Boeing is stabilizing, but the question remains: Can this momentum endure amid unresolved risks?

Operational Gains and Strategic Shifts

Boeing’s improved performance stems from two key areas. First, the Commercial Airplanes segment has rebounded, with 737 MAX production stabilized at 38 units per month—a critical step toward regaining market share. This rate, while below pre-2020 levels, aligns with FAA requirements and supports the company’s goal of achieving positive free cash flow by Q4 2025 [3]. Second, the BDS segment has turned profitable, posting $110 million in operating income after a $913 million loss in 2024 [1]. This shift reflects stronger defense contracts, including a $2.8 billion deal with the U.S. Space Force [4].

However, these gains are tempered by persistent challenges. The 737 MAX 7 and MAX 10 variants remain uncertified due to unresolved issues with the LEAP-1B engine’s de-icing system, delaying entry into a competitive narrowbody market [2]. Certification is now expected in 2026, a year later than initially planned, which could erode Boeing’s ability to capture market share from Airbus’ A320neo family [5].

Financial Risks and Labor Unrest

Boeing’s cash position remains fragile. While free cash outflows narrowed to $2.49 billion in the first half of 2025 (compared to $8.26 billion in 2024), the company still faces a $53.3 billion gross debt load, offset by $23 billion in cash reserves [1]. Analysts project further debt reduction by 2026, but this depends on sustained revenue growth and disciplined cost management [6].

Labor disputes add another layer of uncertainty. A strike by 3,200 defense workers in Missouri and Illinois, which began in August 2025, has paused contract negotiations until after Labor Day [7]. This strike, though smaller than the 2024 commercial jet strike, risks disrupting production of critical military aircraft like the F-15 and F/A-18. Union demands for improved retirement security and healthcare contributions highlight broader tensions between Boeing’s cost-cutting strategy and employee expectations [8].

Valuation and Market Sentiment

From a valuation perspective, Boeing appears undervalued. A DCF model estimates its intrinsic value at $324.06 per share, 27.3% above its current price [1]. The stock’s forward P/E ratio of 265.44 and a P/S ratio of 2.37x suggest mixed signals: while the former indicates high expectations for future earnings, the latter aligns with industry averages [9]. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic, with 20 out of 25 rating the stock as a “Strong Buy” and an average 12-month price target of $258.17 [10].

Strategic Entry Point Considerations

For investors, the key question is timing. Boeing’s next earnings report, scheduled for October 22, 2025, will provide critical data on whether its Q2 gains are sustainable [11]. Positive outcomes—such as progress on 737 MAX certification or a resolution to the labor strike—could catalyze further outperformance. Conversely, delays or setbacks could reignite investor skepticism.

The risk-reward profile tilts in favor of long-term investors who can tolerate near-term volatility. Boeing’s $618.54 billion backlog and strategic focus on sustainable aviation fuel partnerships by 2030 [1] offer long-term growth potential. However, short-term risks, including regulatory scrutiny and production bottlenecks, remain elevated.

Conclusion

Boeing’s Q2 2025 results demonstrate that the company is on a path to recovery, but sustainability hinges on resolving certification delays, stabilizing labor relations, and maintaining financial discipline. While the stock’s valuation and analyst optimism suggest a compelling entry point, investors must weigh these positives against the likelihood of near-term headwinds. For those with a multi-year horizon, Boeing’s turnaround could deliver outsized returns—if management executes its strategy effectively.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-29 03:56:07.639857

During an engaging session titled “Ag Sector Innovations – Powering Sustainable Solutions in the Aviation Industry,” the audience learned how crops and ethanol are being developed into sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) to help reduce emissions in one of the hardest-to-decarbonize sectors.
Panelists highlighted innovations originating in the St. Louis region that are fueling progress on these efforts.

During an engaging session titled “Ag Sector Innovations – Powering Sustainable Solutions in the Aviation Industry,” the audience learned how crops and ethanol are being developed into sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) to help reduce emissions in one of the hardest-to-decarbonize sectors. Panelists highlighted innovations originating in the St. Louis region that are fueling progress on these efforts.

The panel was moderated by Andy Banker, anchor and reporter with KTVI Fox 2, and featured Dr. Yan Zhang, interim center director and director of research for the National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Center (NCERC) on the campus of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, and Jim Hedges, CEO of St. Louis-based CoverCress, Inc. (CCI).

Dr. Zhang explained that since its opening in 2003, NCERC’s focus has expanded from corn-to-ethanol production to scaling up technologies for biopolymers and various other fuels, including SAF. She noted that NCERC is working on the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) pathway, one of eight approved processes for SAF.

“Among the eight pathways in this country, the ATJ is actually a very, very promising way to make a jet fuel to meet the 3-billion-gallon per year mark by 2030 in this country using ethanol from corn starch,” Zhang said. “However, right now there are some challenges. We are not there yet.”

She said the No. 1 challenge the corn-to-ethanol industry is working on is trying to lower the carbon intensity score. “For us, we just need to push a little bit more on the reduction of carbon dioxide emission from fermentation,” Zhang said. “NCERC has a demo-scale project planned in six months. If the results look okay, we will contribute a lot to the development.”

Hedges described how CoverCress Inc., an ag-tech company, is converting a once-noxious weed into a commercially viable crop for renewable fuel. “In a startup world, don’t build a solution in search of a problem. At CCI, we have built a solution to answer a problem,” Hedges said. “The problem is there’s a huge demand for renewable fuel, in this case sustainable aviation fuel. The demand is going to outpace what we can do as an individual company or as a crop. We don’t view other crops as competitors. We want to lift all these solutions up to fulfill the demand, so that the demand doesn’t go away because there’s a lack of solutions.”

He explained that CoverCress, the company’s main crop, is the first new crop introduced in the industry since canola about 60 years ago. It grows between corn and soybean seasons, creating a new revenue stream for farmers while improving soil health.

Hedges highlighted the strategic advantages of the St. Louis region for SAF research and development. “I’ve been in five different startups and I’ve never had the level of talent that I have at CCI,” said Hedges. “The ecosystem of Ag Tech in St. Louis rivals anything in the United States.” He highlighted the proximity to key agricultural stakeholders, access to talent, and a strong innovation community through the Danforth Plant Science Center, 39 North, and BioSTL noting that the local ag-tech ecosystem makes it possible to connect research, commercialization, and farmers efficiently.

Beyond improving carbon intensity scores, both speakers also addressed additional barriers to scaling up SAF production, including retrofitting facilities and encouraging farmers to adopt new crops, and delivering fuel at a competitive cost. But Hedges indicated the change for farmers is very minor, essentially just a few adjustments on the harvesting equipment around small grains. “The grain infrastructure, as it is, is robust and it will satisfy, but we’re going to have to do some adaptation to that infrastructure,” he said. “As we start to scale the product into the hundreds of thousands of acres and into the millions of acres, it’s super competitive; competitive enough that the investors we have are Bayer, Chevron and Bunge.”

Despite the challenges, both panelists expressed optimism about the growing market for sustainable fuels from both commercial and military aviation. Dr. Zhang noted, “We are very proud that my team actually got funding through the Department of Defense to research making SAF-qualified ethanol with feedstocks from Hawaii and tropical islands in the Pacific Ocean. We have the trust and we can do a good job for the future.”

The session also explored the timeline for adoption of SAF in aviation. Both panelists stressed that while the industry is still in its early stages, demand is strong and commitments from industrial partners are real. “We’re at the infancy of that shift,” Hedges said. “Every industrial company involved in aviation is committed, and the funding and innovation will help change the next generation of travel and fuel. As we start into that process of helping deliver on the demand, I can’t even imagine how much different it’s going be 10 years from now.”

Dr. Zhang emphasized the importance of progress for future generations, noting that, as a mother of two, she can see ahead how the next generation will benefit from these changes. “It’s hard to predict exactly how quickly aviation fuels will evolve, but if you have the energy and talent to contribute to change, it feels good to be part of it,” she said.

Banker called attention to Avina Clean Hydrogen’s plan to develop a $280 million SAF facility in the Metro East. “We’re eager to see that project moving forward and look forward to seeing what great new milestones lie ahead for today’s panelists and the rest of this burgeoning SAF industry.”

Collaboration and innovation: Essential for turning challenges into opportunities Reaching net zero carbon emissions is a daunting task that airlines cannot achieve alone.","By Preeti Jain, Head Net Zero Research and Programs, IATA

Since our commitment at the 77th IATA Annual General Meeting in October 2021 to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we are in a moment of retrospection and reflection to assess our journey so far. Achieving net zero emissions is a challenging task in view of the growing demand from a world eager to fly. At the same time, mitigating carbon emissions is an existential need and not an option.

Given that 2025 is the year of the 42nd ICAO Assembly for states to review their long-term global aspirational goal (LTAG) of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, it’s the opportune time for us to see what we have been able to catalyze, shape, and accomplish, and which solutions must be accelerated through supportive government policies to eventually achieve sustainable flying for our future generations.

Implementing net zero transition through concrete actions

One of the biggest challenges is converting ‘Net Zero’ commitments into credible actions. Aviation is a hard-to-decarbonize sector, requiring a multifarious approach through the combined effect of multiple CO2 emissions reduction measures. These include the accelerated adoption of new and innovative aircraft technologies, streamlined flight operations, carbon offsets, and the increased production and deployment of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). Airlines made a sincere commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 with optimism that it would be supported by sovereign policy frameworks and industry partners delivering solutions in an economically and timely prudent manner.

However, this is not happening as anticipated. Particularly in the area of SAF, the development and deployment of SAF is instrumental in mitigating industry carbon emissions by 65% by 2050. Although SAF production has doubled to one million tonnes of SAF in 2024 compared to the previous year and is projected to reach 2 million metric tonnes in 2025, it still represents less than 1% of overall jet fuel demand. This slow pace of SAF adoption, coupled with its higher price, has become a critical dampener to the airlines' decarbonization efforts. Furthermore, the anticipated growth in the offsets market and the momentum towards hydrogen-fueled planes are not propagating enough to sustain the aggressive 2050 timeline. We must realize the transition toward net zero carbon emissions is an economic opportunity and should not be missed.

Strengthening technical understanding to foster collective action toward net zero transition

IATA strives to refine and communicate the scientific and technical understanding of net zero solutions to our airline members and stakeholders at large. Our research objectives reflect the industry’s need for innovative solutions to achieve net zero carbon emissions. In this process, we collaborate across all actors to build understanding and consensus for changing the status quo of existing energy models and supply chains for different net zero solutions.

Last year, IATA released an updated version of the Net Zero Finance Roadmap that contains our detailed assessment of the necessary steps to accelerate the transition to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. In parallel, IATA has worked on building a comprehensive understanding of the key levers and produced several strategically important publications for the industry, including SAF production assessment, guidance on the use of hydrogen in aircraft and aviation infrastructure, assessment of contrail climate impacts, and studies on carbon dioxide removals (CDRs). All these initiatives will, in turn, help set a tone for net zero enablers and collective action.

Collaboration and innovation: Essential for turning challenges into opportunities

Reaching net zero carbon emissions is a daunting task that airlines cannot achieve alone. It requires collaboration among policymakers and stakeholders across energy, aviation, and financing institutions. While developing future-ready technologies, it is equally important to optimize current solutions which are available for deployment. Governments should support the aviation industry's use of solutions like SAF through harmonized, incentive-based policies, rather than restrictive regulatory framework and mandates.

It is good to remember that innovation lies at the heart of the sustainable future we envision today. Renowned economist Joseph Schumpeter’s ‘Theory of Innovation Cycles’ highlights the transformative power of innovation on economies, industries, and societies. The world has witnessed these cycles in the past, where risk capital and policies fostered new technologies before they became the norm. Just as past innovations have transformed various sectors, aviation now stands at a similar crossroads. Innovation in aviation should be supported, promoted, and propagated until new technologies and business models mature to transform existing energy systems. Developing cost-efficient and streamlined technologies is crucial for reducing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.",https://www.iata.org/contentassets/d1162bb5256f449ebe7f2491f5f743b8/net-zero-blog.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 04:56:13.636875

Plant construction is projected to start in the first half of 2026. The initial test flight is expected in 2027 and commercial flight service by 2030.

As much as 15% of JetZero’s pledged 14,560 employees — or 2,184 — could be contractors serving in full-time roles, the manufacturer confirmed Tuesday to N.C. Commerce Department.

Da Silva said JetZero doesn’t view the PTI’s aviation corridor, which includes Boom Supersonic, HAECO, Honda Aircraft Co. and Marshall Aerospace, as competition for employees.

“We’re coming to join you, not to displace you,” Da Silva said. “We’re happy to be here with you.”

Revolutionary, not evolutionary

Da Silva said the aviation industry has spent much of the past 60 years tweaking fuel and engine efficiency and passenger seating, but not the shape of the aircraft itself.

“There’s only so much you can extract from out of the (current) shape in terms of physics,” Da Silva said.

“JetZero’s approach is revolutionary because it does change the shape of the aircraft, using technology that has been studied for more than 35 years.

“We decided it was time to bring that technology to market because the materials are there to do it, the advent of AI, composite materials,” he said. “This time is ripe for the future of flight.”

Da Silva said JetZero’s Z4 blended wing aircraft should appeal to airlines and passengers searching for a more economic and climate friendly way to travel.

Da Silva said that because the Z4 aircraft will consume about half of the aviation fuel of current passenger aircraft, he said “airlines will be able to afford you a more affordable, lower-priced commodity.”

By reducing fuel consumption, Da Silva said the Z4 aircraft also significantly cuts down on carbon dioxide emissions.

“By cutting half of the fuel burn, you cut half of the emissions,” he said. “You can have a great evolution without even having to change the fuel source.”

Da Silva also talked about the challenges of air travel in current passenger aircraft as another selling point for JetZero.

“The shape of our airplane offers us the opportunity to change from what sitting in a tube feels like to sitting in your living room because you have this wide-open space that the airlines can shape in whatever way they want,” Da Silva said.

Da Silva drew a round of applause after saying “we are dimensioning the (passenger) bays in a way where the airlines cannot squeeze as much as they do today.”

“They won’t need to because they are burning 50% less fuel, they’ll be turning around their flight schedule quicker because passenger boardings and deplanings will be faster, servicing will be faster,” Da Silva said.

Background

North Carolina’s $450 million state economic incentive offer to JetZero became official on Aug. 6 as part of Gov. Josh Stein signing into law a mini-state budget bill.

The JetZero funding, provided over a six-year period, is included in House Bill 125 while House and Senate Republicans remain at an impasse over the overall budget bill.

JetZero jobs will include systems and aerospace engineering, supply chain, production workers, administrative and financial, human resources, research and development and customer service.

As JetZero begins to ramp up hiring, available jobs will be posted on its career page (job-boards.greenhouse.io/jetzero), as well as at NCworks.gov and GuilfordWorks.com.

The Z4 airplane, JetZero’s flagship model, is engineered with a blended-wing body to achieve up to 50% better fuel efficiency. The aircraft can seat between 200 and 250 passengers, fly up to 5,000 nautical miles and is compatible with existing airport infrastructure and sustainable aviation fuel.

JetZero is planning for a monthly production rate of 20 planes when five years into full production.

Plenty of infrastructure decisions remain for JetZero and the Piedmont Triad Airport Authority, foremost the size of the plant and how many acres the campus will require.

JetZero and the authority plan to dedicate the rest of 2025 to determining the shape of the plant and how best to fit the structure on the airport campus.

According to a presentation by the company, JetZero plans to pay an average annual wage of $89,340.

In exchange, the State Economic Investment Committee said the plant would be eligible for up to $1.57 billion in direct Job Investment Development grants.

The Guilford County Board of Commissioners confirmed at a special incentive hearing that the county will provide up to $75.9 million in performance-based incentives over 20 years.

Meanwhile, the Greensboro City Council approved paying $1,000 in incentives for every job created, which would make for at least a $14.56 million commitment.

Your business will be on the path to success if you land yourself at Teesside International Airport.

Since being brought back into public ownership in 2019, a consistent focus on estate and asset development has made the airport a prime location for top companies – with fantastic news stories spinning out of their arrival.

Willis Aviation Services is constructing its second twin-bay hangar to cater for its growing aircraft repair and overhaul operations, expanding the company’s thriving presence which recently saw it sign a new maintenance deal with Jet2.

Aircraft painting firm Airbourne Colours is also building a second facility, as it scores jobs with EasyJet, Jet2, Loganair, TUI and others, bringing even more jobs and apprenticeships to the site.

Aviation services and technology firm Draken, which currently operates two hangars for its £173m MoD contract, has signalled its further commitment with the airport as it seeks to build a new five-bay maintenance hangar with offices and workshops.

And FedEx, the world’s largest transportation company, has signed a five-year deal for an airfreight handling facility at Teesside – moving its operations from Newcastle. The airport already boasts its own cargo handling facility, with the latest screening technology, and is famed for its handling of urgent or last-minute goods.

Thanks to these, the airport recorded a year-on-year cargo increase of 130.7% in June 2025.

When it comes to import and export, as part of the Teesside Freeport’s customs zones, firms operating here will receive a range of tariff benefits, including duty deferral while the goods remain on-site and the suspension of VAT on goods entering the customs zone.

Businesses can also manufacture goods using the imports and add value, before exporting to international markets, without ever paying the full tariff on the original goods.

It’s not only aviation-related firms relocating here. Global car repair firm ABL 1Touch has become the first tenant at the south of the site, which offers high-quality office and Grade A industrial development opportunities across 270 acres, all with airside access if required.

ABL 1Touch’s Unit D is the first of four units which will be built to cover 130,000 sq ft with direct access to the road network via a convenient mile-long link road off the A67.

Like all the developments to come, the principle behind the 25,105 sq ft facility has been to provide a loose fit base build to each unit with a plug-and-play approach to meet individual requirements.

This has been established with an understood base performance that can be enhanced by an uplift in material choices as well as bespoke elements of fitout to suit individual tenant needs.

In total, Teesside Airport boasts 375 acres of developable land, including 5.2m sq ft/483,277 sq m of industrial, logistics and aviation development.

The airport has a strategy to become operationally net zero by 2030. This includes self-sufficient electricity for the site and tenants from an under-development solar array, a hydrogen vehicle refuelling station and involvement in sustainable aviation fuel research – helping your company meet its clean energy ambitions.

The $53.3 billion debt load, coupled with potential labor strikes and certification delays, could derail progress.
Conclusion: A High-Stakes Gamble Boeing’s 2025 turnaround under Ortberg is a testament to the power of disciplined leadership in crisis.","Boeing’s journey under CEO Kelly Ortberg has been a study in balancing short-term survival with long-term reinvention. After reporting a $6 billion quarterly loss in Q3 2024—the second-largest in its history—the aerospace giant has shown glimmers of recovery in 2025. Yet, the question remains: Is this turnaround sustainable enough to justify long-term investment in a stock still shadowed by debt, regulatory scrutiny, and operational fragility?

Operational Recovery: Stabilizing the Core

Ortberg’s first act as CEO was to prioritize quality over speed. By slowing 737 MAX production to 38 units per month in Q2 2025, Boeing reduced bottlenecks and improved margins, which turned from -11.9% in 2024 to -5.1% in 2025 [1]. This disciplined approach, though initially controversial, has stabilized cash burn, which fell to $200 million per quarter from $4.3 billion in the prior year [4]. The Commercial Airplanes segment, now generating $10.87 billion in revenue (up 81% year-over-year), has become a cash flow engine, supported by a $522 billion backlog of orders [6].

However, challenges persist. Certification delays for the 737 MAX 7 and 10 variants, expected until 2026, could disrupt production timelines [1]. Meanwhile, the Defense, Space & Security segment—once a drag on profits—has turned a corner, posting a 1.7% operating margin in Q2 2025 and securing a $2.8 billion satellite contract for the U.S. Space Force [3]. This pivot to defense and space, now accounting for 35% of revenue, offers a stable cash flow stream amid commercial aviation’s volatility [5].

Strategic Shifts: From Debt to Discipline

Ortberg’s strategic playbook includes aggressive debt reduction and a focus on sustainable aviation. Boeing’s gross debt of $53.3 billion remains daunting, but deleveraging efforts—such as the $21 billion stock issuance in 2024 and the sale of its Digital Aviation Solutions business—have improved its credit profile [2]. Fitch Ratings recently noted that Boeing’s debt could fall “significantly” by 2026, though its debt-to-capital ratio of 106.6% still exceeds the 60% covenant threshold in its new $3 billion credit facility [7].

The CEO has also reoriented Boeing toward innovation. Partnerships for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) compatibility by 2030 and net-zero emissions targets align with global decarbonization trends [5]. In defense, Boeing’s F-47 fighter jet contract and sixth-generation R&D investments signal a bid to reclaim market share from competitors like Lockheed Martin [6].

Analyst Optimism vs. Lingering Risks

Analysts remain cautiously optimistic. With 20 out of 25 analysts recommending a “Strong Buy” and a $249.21 average target price (12.3% upside from current levels), the stock has gained 39% since Ortberg’s appointment [8]. Projections suggest adjusted earnings per share could jump from a $1.95 loss in 2025 to $11.92 in 2029, driven by free cash flow turning positive by 2026 [8].

Yet, risks loom large. The $53.3 billion debt load, coupled with potential labor strikes and certification delays, could derail progress. A recent $445 million DOJ fine for compliance lapses further underscores operational vulnerabilities [3]. Moreover, the proposed sale of Boeing’s space division—home to the Starliner spacecraft—remains unresolved, with Blue Origin and other bidders weighing in [6].

The Calculus for Long-Term Investors

For long-term investors, Boeing’s appeal lies in its structural advantages: a $619 billion total backlog, a 35% defense revenue buffer, and a leadership team prioritizing operational discipline. Ortberg’s emphasis on safety culture—reducing tool loss by 85% and streamlining governance documents—has restored some customer trust, with United Airlines praising Boeing’s “straight talk” on delivery schedules [5].

However, the path to profitability is far from certain. The company’s interest coverage ratio remains negative, and its BBB- credit rating carries a negative outlook [7]. A successful turnaround will require not only stabilizing the 737 MAX program but also launching a new aircraft to compete with Airbus—a costly and time-intensive endeavor.

Conclusion: A High-Stakes Gamble

Boeing’s 2025 turnaround under Ortberg is a testament to the power of disciplined leadership in crisis. Yet, the stock’s long-term potential hinges on its ability to navigate regulatory hurdles, manage debt, and innovate in a sector defined by rapid technological shifts. For investors with a high risk tolerance and a multi-year horizon, Boeing offers a compelling narrative of resilience. But for those seeking certainty, the aerospace giant’s turbulent history serves as a stark reminder: even the most ambitious turnarounds can falter under the weight of their own legacy.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-29 02:56:38.423962

Biofuels (and Sustainable Aviation Fuel in particular) hold the promise of reduced carbon emissions – without the need to overhaul the aircraft and technology already in use.

Let’s explore what biofuels are, how they’re made, why they matter for helicopter operations, and what hurdles remain. We’ll also take a look at what the future looks like as the industry begins to integrate this cleaner fuel option into daily operations.

What Are Biofuels in Helicopter Operations?

Biofuels are fuels derived from renewable resources. They are an eco-friendly alternative to conventional jet fuel, which has powered helicopter engines for decades.

The biofuel that is used in helicopter operations is called Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF is derived from non-petroleum organic material known as feedstocks, which include:

Agricultural waste

Algae

Animal waste

Municipal waste

Non-food crops

Plant oils

Recycled cooking grease

One key benefit of SAF is that it’s a “drop-in replacement” for conventional jet fuel. This means SAF can power existing aircraft without the need for engine modifications.

The other critical advantage is that SAF is made from carbon sources that already exist as part of the natural carbon cycle. This results in lower overall emissions, making it a powerful tool in the aircraft industry’s push for sustainability.

Powering the Future: Benefits of Biofuels for Helicopter Missions

Biofuels like Sustainable Aviation Fuel offer a practical way for the helicopter industry to reduce the environmental impact of flights, especially in essential sectors like disaster response, firefighting, and heavy-lift construction.

Here are the top three advantages of making biofuels the go-to fuel for the helicopter industry:

Reduced Carbon Emissions

Aviation currently accounts for 2% of all carbon dioxide CO₂ emissions and 12% of all CO₂ emissions from transportation on a global scale. SAF has the potential to reduce lifecycle CO₂ emissions by 80% over the fuel’s lifecycle when compared to fossil fuels, directly contributing to more sustainable aviation.

No Need for New Infrastructure

Because SAF is a drop-in replacement, it integrates with existing fuel systems and helicopter engines. This means helicopter teams won’t need to overhaul their fleet or construct new fueling stations in order to significantly reduce the harmful emissions that contribute to climate change.

SAF can currently be blended with conventional jet fuel at levels ranging from 10% to 50%, depending on feedstock type and production method. In the future, 100% SAF could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 94%.

Long-Term Cost Effectiveness

While production is still scaling up and current prices for SAF tend to be higher than for traditional jet fuel, this renewable option will likely offer long-term savings as carbon pricing and environmental regulations evolve.

Barriers to the Widespread Adoption of Biofuels

While biofuels promise a more sustainable future, there are several key obstacles the aviation industry is still working to overcome. These challenges must be addressed before renewable fuels can become the standard in helicopter operations:

Production Scalability: The availability of feedstock supply must expand (without disrupting food production) to meet the growing demands from the aviation industry. While innovations like algae-based fuels are promising, scaling production remains a challenge.

Engine Certification Requirements: Not all helicopter engines and aircraft are fully approved to operate on 100% SAF. Fuel blends of up to 50% are becoming more common, but more research and testing – as well as industry and policymaker collaboration – are needed for full certification.

Higher Upfront Costs: SAF is still more expensive than conventional jet fuel. Prices are expected to decrease as production methods improve and demand grows, but we’re not quite there yet.

Where We Are Now: The Status of SAF in Helicopter Operations

In 2021, Safran Helicopter Engines achieved a world first at its Bordes facility in France, where the company successfully ran a helicopter engine on 100% SAF. In this groundbreaking test, a Makila 2 engine was powered entirely by biofuel made from waste and residue including used cooking oil.

All aircraft from Safran Helicopter Engines are certified to run on 50% SAF, and the manufacturer plans to obtain a 100% biofuel approval by 2030.

Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin company, also approved the use of SAF blends (of up to 50%) for its S-92 helicopter, which is in routine use in offshore energy support and other commercial operations.

Other helicopters – like the Bell 505 and Airbus H225 – are also either approved or have successfully demonstrated using SAF, and that list is steadily growing. More engines are undergoing testing, with manufacturers working to certify higher SAF blends.

Many companies, from Sikorsky to Airbus, are spearheading efforts to certify their aircraft for 100% SAF by the end of the decade.

What the Future Holds for Biofuels in Helicopter Aviation

Biofuels are set to play a major role in the future of helicopter operations. With growing research and investment, the path ahead is becoming clearer and more promising every day.

Here’s what we can expect to see over the next couple of decades:

Certification Advancements: Regulatory approval for using 100% SAF in helicopters is getting closer, thanks to successful tests with higher-blend fuels paving the way.

Faster, Cheaper Production: Emerging technologies are making SAF production more efficient and cost-effective. Innovations using algae, agricultural residue, and even municipal waste show significant promise.

Supportive Policy and Industry Goals: Global and national climate goals, along with financial incentives and fuel blending mandates, are helping drive the adoption of SAF across the aviation industry. As policy momentum grows, the gap between SAF and fossil fuel prices will close.

Hybrid Power Systems: Looking further ahead, hybrid-electric helicopters could pair battery-powered systems with turbines running on SAF to blend clean electricity with sustainable fuel for even greener flight. This would offer even greater emissions reductions. Leading engine manufacturers are already working on prototypes.

By mobilizing private markets, the bank argues it is helping member countries achieve sustainable progress that benefits both communities and ecosystems.","The Asian Development Bank (ADB), working through its research-focused arms such as the Office of Markets Development and Public–Private Partnership and the Private Sector Operations Department, has set out a bold agenda in its August 2025 Market Solutions report. Positioned as both financier and convener, ADB aims to mobilize private sector innovation and investment to drive inclusive, resilient, and sustainable development across Asia and the Pacific. The document captures the urgency of climate challenges and the need for transformational markets, emphasizing that sustainable growth requires collaboration between public institutions, private investors, and innovators. ADB’s message is unmistakable: no single actor can deliver the sweeping transformation the region needs, but partnerships, informed by research and backed by finance, can reshape development trajectories.

Climate Finance at the Center of Growth

A central feature of ADB’s vision is its commitment to climate finance. The bank has pledged to raise more than $100 billion in cumulative climate-related financing from its own resources between 2019 and 2030. By the end of that period, 50% of its total committed financing will be climate-focused. This goal reflects both the scale of the climate crisis and the economic opportunity in accelerating the energy transition and green growth. The urgency is matched by results: between 2022 and 2024, ADB’s private sector operations more than doubled, signaling a surge in investor interest and institutional commitment. By 2030, the target is to quadruple private investment financing to $13 billion annually. This expansion is framed as a way to build vibrant private sectors that not only generate jobs and income but also channel capital into impactful climate investments.

Building Markets through Advisory and Innovation

The report identifies three main areas where ADB is working to shape markets. First is policy and institutional support, which helps governments create strong frameworks that attract investors and ensure transparent, stable markets. Second is transaction advisory, where ADB leverages its expertise to help both public and private clients design infrastructure projects that are commercially viable and investment-ready. Third is innovative financing, which blends instruments such as loans, guarantees, equity, and concessional resources to mitigate risks and create pathways for capital that might otherwise stay on the sidelines. These functions work together: strong policies build confidence, expert advisory creates sound projects, and innovative financing ensures bankability. ADB’s role is not confined to funding; it is about shaping entire ecosystems where markets can flourish and where development gains are sustainable.

Tangible Results and Demonstrated Impact

The report makes its case with a portfolio of results that highlight both financial impact and developmental outcomes. In 2024, ADB committed $2.6 billion to private sector projects and delivered $2.4 billion in climate cofinancing. It reached a record 58 project commitments, underscoring rising momentum. The bank’s Trade and Supply Chain Finance Program executed $4.9 billion in transactions during the year, while $4.3 billion in private capital was mobilized, including a milestone $2.1 billion for the rehabilitation of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) in the Philippines. Between 2016 and 2024, ADB supported more than 100 completed or ongoing public–private partnership projects, a testament to its growing role as a market enabler. The numbers are paired with stories of change: new jobs for vulnerable groups, expanded opportunities for women, and a stronger private sector backbone across developing member countries.

Flagship Projects in Action

Two highlighted initiatives illustrate how ADB translates strategy into impact. In Pakistan, the bank partnered with SAFCO Venture Holdings Limited to develop the region’s first private-sector-led sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) facility. The $91.2 million financing package, structured by ADB as lead arranger, combines its own resources with syndicated contributions from global financiers like the Emerging Africa & Asia Infrastructure Fund, ILX, and the International Finance Corporation. The plant will convert waste-based feedstock such as used cooking oil into aviation fuel, reducing carbon emissions by up to 85% compared to conventional jet fuel. More than a single project, it positions Pakistan as a pioneer in a growing global market while contributing to the target of 70% SAF in the aviation fuel mix by 2050.

In the Philippines, ADB served as transaction advisor for the modernization of NAIA, one of Southeast Asia’s busiest airports. The project was designed under a rehabilitate–operate–expand–transfer model that integrates climate resilience and mandates at least 20% renewable energy use. It also promotes sustainable aviation fuel. A carefully structured financial model ensures both private profitability and public benefit, using a blend of upfront payments, annuities, and revenue-sharing to maximize government receipts. This project demonstrates how ADB’s advisory role goes beyond technical guidance, it embeds climate sensitivity and financial innovation into long-term infrastructure planning.

The report is a broader narrative of inclusion and shared prosperity. ADB stresses that its projects are not only about infrastructure or finance but about creating jobs, particularly for vulnerable populations and women, while advancing green growth. By mobilizing private markets, the bank argues it is helping member countries achieve sustainable progress that benefits both communities and ecosystems. The tone is forward-looking and confident, presenting ADB as an institution that has evolved from a traditional lender into a market-shaping partner. In doing so, it seeks to rally investors, innovators, and governments around the idea that sustainable development is a collective enterprise, and that well-designed markets, backed by robust institutions and innovative finance, can transform the future of Asia and the Pacific.",https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/28_08_2025_10_19_24_0385809.png?width=920&format=jpeg,N,,2025-08-29 02:56:54.800170

Professor Marcellin said the win reflected the unique partnerships at the heart of the Hub.
Professor Marcellin said the Hub was designed to give industry the scale and ambition needed to make real change.
“This shows just how urgent it is to bridge the gap between research and industry,” Professor Rowan said.
The hub will be co-located at UQ’s Andrew N. Liveris Building and AIBN and is open to industry, researchers and governments from Australia and overseas.","UQ’s Biosustainability Hub (the Hub) has won the 2025 AFR Higher Education Award for Industry Engagement, with Hub Director and AIBN Group Leader Professor Esteban Marcellin accepting the honour.

Backed by a A$60 million investment, the Hub is Australia’s first centre designed to help companies shift to lower carbon, sustainable production.

The AFR Higher Education Awards celebrate excellence across the sector, with the Industry Engagement category shining a light on research partnerships delivering real-world impact.

Professor Marcellin said the win reflected the unique partnerships at the heart of the Hub.

“This award is really about the power of collaboration,” he said.

“By working with industry, we can harness biology not just to publish papers, but to potentially transform how we make the things we all rely on like fuels, chemicals, medicines.

“That’s how we could reduce our impact on the planet while building stronger industries for the future.”

That vision is already taking shape, supported by the Queensland Government, UQ, and industry partners including Woodside Energy and many others.

Around 100 researchers are tackling 37 projects already underway, from dairy proteins to sustainable aviation fuel, in collaboration with companies such as All G Foods, MSF Sugar and Fonterra.

Professor Marcellin said the Hub was designed to give industry the scale and ambition needed to make real change.

“It’s about creating a place where companies of all sizes can work side by side with researchers to seek to turn bold ideas into reality,” he said.

“I’m proud that we’re building something here in Queensland that you simply won’t find anywhere else in Australia.”

The initiative builds on more than a decade of world-leading biomanufacturing expertise at UQ’s Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN).

“Ten years ago, Professor Lars Nielsen and I were approached at AIBN by LanzaTech to see if we could build a mathematical model to understand microbes that can turn carbon emissions into ethanol,” Professor Marcellin recalled.

“That small idea has grown into a leading biohub driving net-zero innovation.”

Dr Sean Simpson, LanzaTech founder and part of the Hub steering committee, described the initiative as a critical step for the global industry, emphasising its role in bridging research and commercialisation.

“The Hub is a vital platform for connecting academic research with industry-scale innovation,” Dr Simpson said.

“It provides the deep knowledge we need to enable commercialisation and expand the space in which we can convert above-ground carbon resources into sustainable products.”

The award ceremony in Sydney also showcased the Hub’s value for local partners, with Professor Marcellin joined by Jan Pacas, CEO from industry partner All G.

“Partnering with the Hub gives us access to world-class researchers and facilities,” Mr Pacas said.

“It’s exactly what industry needs and allows companies like All G to scale innovation faster.”

The Hub’s impact reaches from emerging innovators to some of Australia’s largest companies.

“The Biosustainability Hub has the potential to help industry transition to a lower-carbon[1] economy,” said Dr Jitendra Joshi, Head of Carbon to Products at Woodside Energy.

“For Woodside, it’s an opportunity to work alongside UQ researchers on potential solutions that could deliver real impact at global scale.”

Australia currently ranks second to last out of 30 OECD countries on the proportion of businesses collaborating with higher education and public research institutions on innovation, according to OECD data cited by the Department of Education.

AIBN Director Professor Alan Rowan said the award underscored the Hub’s pivotal role in closing that gap and shaping Australia’s bioeconomy.

“This shows just how urgent it is to bridge the gap between research and industry,” Professor Rowan said.

“The Biosustainability Hub is exactly that bridge - a place where companies can cost-effectively tap into R&D and seek to build innovations that deliver both economic and environmental impact.

“It’s fantastic to see AFR recognise the Hub’s role as a national model for university-industry collaboration.

“The Hub is driving Australia’s bioeconomy by creating jobs, building industries, and tackling global challenges all at once.”

The Hub now has eleven research leaders spanning Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation (QAAFI), School of Chemistry and Molecular Biology (SCMB), School of Chemical Engineering, School of Civil Engineering, Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN), and School of Agriculture and Food Sustainability (SAFS), providing expertise in gas fermentation, precision fermentation, bioengineering, and bioprocess optimization.

The hub will be co-located at UQ’s Andrew N. Liveris Building and AIBN and is open to industry, researchers and governments from Australia and overseas.

The AIBN project is progressing in close collaboration with UQ Properties and Facilities Division, Wilson Architects, ADP Consulting, Wood Consulting, FARA Construction, and the Liveris Infrastructure team to ensure its timely completion by the end of 2025.",https://aibn.uq.edu.au/files/29423/Advanced-biomanufacturing-banner.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 22:56:56.604974

Porter is a privately held independent airline, making its debut in 2006 with two De Havilland Dash 8-400s.

A small group, including Michael Deluce, CEO of Porter, and his father Robert Deluce, current Executive Chairman, founder of the airline and scion of Canada’s famous aviation family, decided to design, build and pay for the terminal building at Billy Bishop in order to support the airline’s business plan, and from there, a single route to Ottawa was launched. The vision was to change the perception of regional air travel to create an experience that passengers enjoyed and looked forward to. Porter decided to focus on the onboard experience to channel this feeling, homing in on high quality, complimentary beer, wine, and snacks, as well as free access to Wi-Fi.

From the beginning, Porter faced numerous hurdles, such as having its request to operate A220s at Billy Bishop denied due to jet aircraft being forbidden.

Initially the airline had placed an order for 30 A220s and was set to be the Canadian launch customer of the aircraft, but the 1983 Tripartite Agreement at the airport restricted aircraft options.

Michael Deluce well recalls the array of challenges that arose as the airline first took to the skies.

He says: “Our competitors were prepared to do everything possible to prevent us from taking off, including challenging our application to operate US flights, being taken to court on multiple occasions regarding our operations at Billy Bishop Airport, and having our daily slots (or number of flights) temporarily reduced at Newark airport. It all took a certain amount of dedication and perseverance.”

However, Porter encountered its biggest hurdle of all when faced with the Covid-19 pandemic. While all airlines struggled, it was forced to suspend its operations in March 2020, only restarting 18 months later, and was the only airline in Canada to do so.

From September 2021, having had months to develop a growth plan, Porter began to rebuild, and Deluce maintains that it was the best choice the airline could have made to preserve the company.

Conquering Canada – APEX and Skytrax award-winning airline experience

Challenges faced and overcome, Porter is now a national airline, flying to every Canadian province and serving as the largest airline to operate from Ottawa and the third largest airline flying to the US and Canada from Toronto Pearson International Airport.

More importantly to Porter, the airline has achieved consistent soaring reviews and feedback from passengers, with customer satisfaction resting in the mid-80s, and numerous accolades to its name, including a four-star rating from the Airline Passenger Experience Association (APEX) and North America’s Best Regional Airline award from Skytrax in 2024.

Today, with a team of 4,000 employees, Porter operates a fleet of 29 De Havilland Dash 8-400s and 44 Embraer E195-E2s, with plans to reach 100 of the latter aircraft over the coming years.

With such an extensive fleet expansion under way, the airline’s route portfolio has been steadily increasing in tandem.

As Deluce puts it: “We are just getting started.”

Porter flies to 23 Canadian destinations and 16 US destinations, with constant updates to its flight schedules and route maps to meet the growing demand for regional air travel.

In the first three months of 2025 alone, Porter announced six route developments, such as new destinations or increased flights for the summer season.

Currently, less than half of the 100 E195-E2s have been delivered, and gradually, as the remainder of the fleet is delivered, Porter intends to expand frequencies to key routes such as Toronto, Ottawa, Montréal and Halifax.

Another ambition in the pipeline is the addition of routes to more diverse destinations for winter tourism, such as Mexico and the Caribbean.

Deluce says: “In 2023, we launched our growth plan to expand the network across North America using the state-of-the-art E195-E2 aircraft. With the E195-E2 we are challenging the definition of economy air travel with a level of service that is non-existent in air travel today.

“Porter is now operating throughout North America, increasing the connectivity of our overall network. Passengers can also expect to travel seamlessly across the globe by connecting with our partner airlines, such as Air Transat and Alaska.”

Embraer everywhere – From De Havilland Canada’s Dash 8 to Embraer’s E195-E2

But why is the E195-E2 featuring so prominently in Porter’s success and future plans? It remains to be said that Porter stands by the Dash 8, with Deluce praising its performance.

“We’ve always been happy with the Dash 8,” he says. “It has served us very well for the past 18 years and is very efficient for the sectors we use it.

“Its jet-like performance is ideal for serving the high-frequency business routes that make up a significant portion of our regional network.”

Yet the increase of Embraer aircraft within Porter’s fleet is a marker of an even stronger future for the airline.

First and foremost, the aircraft fits the airline’s mantra of “Flying Refined” due to its two-seat configuration and extra leg room. A lack of a middle seat means that there is no “bad seat” in the customer’s mind.

Equally, the aircraft are optimal for Porter’s operations. With a full-passenger range of 2,600 nm and claims from Embraer that the aircraft is 12.5 per cent more fuel efficient than its closest competitor, the E195-E2 is able to provide both the comfort and the performance desired from an airline that seeks to fill a premium regional aviation gap.

Deluce says: “The E195-E2 is a great product overall. It has the performance needed to reach the markets we want to serve, and from a sustainability standpoint it’s the most environmentally friendly single-aisle aircraft family.

“It has the lowest operating costs – cost per seat and cost per flight of aircraft its size. The interior complements Porter’s traditional service offering, with a passenger-focused design emphasising space and comfort. They allow us to fly just about anywhere in North America from Eastern Canada.”

Strategising for success – Tracking passenger travel behaviours for airline operation strategy

When it comes to operational strategy, Porter benefits from the frequent busy periods of travel to Canada, with peaks during the March break and other holidays, as well as over the summer and Christmas.

Meanwhile, its US destinations see similar periods, with more passengers travelling to warm destinations such as Florida, California and Arizona during the winter.

In the quieter periods, Porter prioritises aircraft maintenance and has recently announced plans to expand its maintenance facilities by leasing a 20,000 square foot hangar at Halifax Stanfield International Airport.

The airline’s primary location at Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport is another benefit, with the airport seeing 1.7 million passengers in 2024 and ranking as the ninth busiest airport in Canada.

Billy Bishop also supports the local community considerably, generating over CAD 2.1 billion in economic output and providing 4,450 jobs.

Deluce says: “Our high-frequency schedule is valued by our passengers – both business and leisure – providing unmatched connectivity to downtown Toronto and other key regional centres. Billy Bishop is a key driver for tourism in Toronto.”

On the market front, the airline is continuing to target the crossover section between high-standard service for an economy price and is particularly looking at pushing its reach further across North America.

A bright future – New loyalty programme and passenger terminal to assist passenger growth

The future looks bright for Porter, and Deluce says there is a lot of growth ahead for 2025.

At the end of March, the airline launched the BMO VIPorter Mastercard line-up, enabling customers to use a loyalty credit card that it is hoped will develop into an impactful revenue stream.

It also marks the only travel credit card programme in Canada to grant immediate frequent flyer benefits for cardholders.

Launching the credit card, Edmond Eldebs, the airline’s Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, said: “Porter is growing faster than any Canadian airline and opportunities to use points for meaningful travel experiences are growing along with us.”

For the second half of 2025, Porter will complete the co-development of a passenger terminal at Montréal Metropolitan Airport (MET) in Saint Hubert.

Discussing what this will mean for Porter and its customers, Deluce says: “Much like efforts to revitalise Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport 18 years ago, this second airport will provide Greater Montréal with a convenient alternative for much of the population within a comfortable terminal environment. More than 10 potential MET routes have been initially identified, spanning from Vancouver to St John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador.”

Another update in the pipeline is the opening of US Customs Preclearance at Billy Bishop in late 2025, which is expected to improve connection times with partner airlines and the possibility of new locations that were not previously available due to a lack of customs services.

When it comes to sustainability, Porter doesn’t have any firm initiatives in place, but rather approaches the subject from a broader perspective, with responsible practices and emissions management.

Deluce says: “We know that travel is beneficial for personal, cultural and economic reasons. The industry is investing in many new technologies, including significantly more efficient aircraft, to reduce emissions and meet net zero goals. It’s important for governments to assist with this transition globally by making financial investments in areas such as sustainable aviation fuel – much like they are doing for other industries.”

Passenger priority – Enhancing travel experiences with PorterReserve and PorterClassic

Porter continues to target a specific audience of the economy air travel market and is upping the ante by providing a range of superior services that previously were not often seen in short-haul and regional travel.

Currently, Porter offers PorterReserve and PorterClassic as tiers of service. PorterClassic enables passengers to customise the perks that are most important to them, such as extra baggage and travel flexibility, with varying fares – Basic, Standard, Flexible, Freedom – while maintaining the premium benefits of Porter’s standard fare.

PorterReserve provides a more all-inclusive experience and is selected by a balanced split of leisure and business travellers, with an extra checked bag, shorter security lines and early boarding.

Varying ticket fares for enhanced economy experiences haven’t been the norm for this segment of the travel market thus far, but Deluce sees a growing demand for these types of services.

He says: “We’ve seen an increase in leisure economy travellers interested in the PorterReserve experience for longer flights on board the E195-E2. This all-inclusive economy product has many attributes that other airlines provide with business class or premium economy, such as extra legroom and priority boarding. We also offer free Wi-Fi and healthy meals on longer flights.

“The pricing of PorterReserve is very attractive for leisure travellers who want a better experience with all the perks included or for business travellers who want a quality experience at a much more affordable price.”

There are few airlines like Porter, and this unique perspective of passenger experience from an affordable price point is what has propelled this airline’s success and assisted it to overcome the plentiful challenges along the way.

With expansion to a wider range of destinations on the horizon and an ever-growing efficient fleet, Porter’s customer-first service is set to impact many more happy passengers to come.",https://www.laranews.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Copy-of-Front-image-for-web-3.png,N,,2025-08-28 17:56:42.964528

Importantly, SAF is a ‘drop-in’ fuel that can be blended with conventional jet fuel and used in today’s aircraft without engine modifications.
The fuel produces nearly the same amount of CO₂ as traditional jet fuel when burned.
Total SAF usage currently accounts for less than 2 percent of total global jet fuel consumption.
Still, Neste says global SAF production is sufficient to meet existing mandates in the EU and UK.","Unlike kerosene-based jet fuel, SAF is produced from renewable or recycled bio-organic sources and can lower total greenhouse gas emissions over time. It can be produced from biomass like corn, used cooking oil, and agricultural residues, as well as from municipal waste or synthetic fuels made by combining captured CO₂ with green hydrogen (‘power-to-liquid’). Importantly, SAF is a ‘drop-in’ fuel that can be blended with conventional jet fuel and used in today’s aircraft without engine modifications. The fuel produces nearly the same amount of CO₂ as traditional jet fuel when burned. But because SAF is made from renewable or recycled carbon sources, net lifecycle emissions can be up to 80 percent lower, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Ultimately, the IATA estimates SAF could make up 65 percent of the emissions reduction need for aviation to reach net-zero CO₂ emissions by 2050. It’s an important piece of the pie in addition to improving technology like carbon capture.

The need for SAF is rising. Commercial aviation accounts for about 2.5 percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions. As other sectors of the economy become more sustainable and the amount of flights around the world increases, the share of total emissions from flying will only grow – unless airlines can find effective ways to lower their environmental impact. In addition to carbon capture, which involves pulling carbon from the air and storing it underground, the adoption of SAF is increasingly viewed as a viable means for the aviation sector to reduce its emissions.

Still, a spokesperson for Neste, a Finnish energy company founded in 1948, told me there’s still a long way to go. Total SAF usage currently accounts for less than 2 percent of total global jet fuel consumption.

Neste, originally focused on securing Finland’s oil supply, has transformed over the decades into a SAF leader focused on renewable and circular energy solutions. Neste’s Singapore refinery is the world’s largest SAF facility, capable of producing 1 million tons annually. Neste isn’t alone. Boston’s World Energy has produced SAF since 1998, while Reno-based XCF Global recently became the first publicly traded SAF company in the United States.

The industry is gaining traction, though critics remain skeptical of SAF’s scalability and environmental value. Its future is far from guaranteed, and SAF alone is unlikely to erase aviation’s heavy carbon footprint. Still, momentum is building. Commercial aviation may be moving toward a cleaner future. What role SAF will play remains unclear.

How SAF works

SAF is straightforward in concept but complex to produce. The most common production method is known as HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids), which uses renewable oils and fats such as used cooking oil, animal fats, and some non-food vegetable oils. These are treated with hydrogen at high temperature and pressure to remove oxygen and impurities, producing paraffinic hydrocarbons that closely resemble conventional jet fuel and can be blended directly (hence the term “drop-in” fuel).

Sustainability efforts are highly marketable these days. While companies that reduce their environmental impact deserve credit, consumers are wary of greenwashing. Delta Air Lines was the first US carrier to offer offsets when travelers book flights in 2007, and doing so is now an industry standard. It’s easy to see this as shifting the sustainability burden to consumers rather than the companies. SAF instead allows companies to take a bigger responsibility in reducing emissions.

Airlines buy SAF certificates (SAFc) to document emissions cuts. SAFc uses a system called ‘insetting,’ which separates the verified emissions savings from the fuel itself. Airlines can then apply those savings to their overall carbon footprint from flights. This sounds similar to how carbon offset credits, which have been shown to be ineffective without strict monitoring, are applied. But the SAFc system is considered more reliable because it’s tracked through a ‘Book and Claim’ ledger. This helps prevent double counting of emissions reductions, ensure integrity, and allows SAF to be used where most efficient, all while still letting companies claim the associated emissions cuts in their supply chains.

This could prove to be the key difference in helping both the public and airlines get on board with developing and implementing more SAF use.

“Delivering the emissions reduction value of SAF with SAFc insets is increasingly recognized as the best tool to scale investment in the SAF industry,” Karen Boyd, director of product sustainability at World Energy, says.

Where does current policy on SAF stand?

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has set a net-zero target for 2050. It introduced a Global Framework calling for a 5 percent emissions cut by 2030 through SAF and lower-carbon fuels. The European Union’s ReFuelEU regulation is the most ambitious program in the world, requiring airlines to blend their jet fuel with 2 percent SAF by 2025, 6 percent by 2030, and 70 percent by 2050, with dedicated targets for synthetic e-fuels. The UK has set a similar path with a 9.5% SAF target by 2030, while Ireland recently launched its first national SAF roadmap. In North America, the US Inflation Reduction Act offers SAF tax credits and $300 million for research and infrastructure, while Canada supports production through mandates, incentives, and public–private partnerships. Time will tell whether any of these benefits survive the current administration’s environmental rollbacks.

India, Brazil, and a handful of other countries also have SAF mandates in place. China, South Korea, Turkey, and the UAE are developing frameworks. By 2030, government mandates are expected to cover about 75 percent of global jet fuel use, requiring airlines to use roughly 2 billion gallons of SAF each year. That’s far more than the 1 percent of global jet fuel that SAF accounts for today, with production constrained by feedstock scarcity, high costs, and delayed projects.

The gap between policy goals and current supply means scaling up investment and infrastructure is essential. Still, Neste says global SAF production is sufficient to meet existing mandates in the EU and UK. That’s because these mandates are currently quite low – and because the ongoing expansion of Neste’s Rotterdam refinery will bring the company’s total SAF production capability to 2.2 million tons annually in 2027. XCF and other producers are scaling in the same manner.

Progress and making the costs make sense

In June 2025, XCF Global, a synthetic aviation fuel producer, took the vision for decarbonized air travel directly to Wall Street when it went public via a merger with Focus Impact BH3 Acquisition Company under the ticker SAFX. The company promotes “feedstock-agnostic technology” that isn’t reliant on corn or monocrop agriculture. At the company’s facility in Reno, Nevada, it produces SAF in the largest industrial park in the country.

“SAF in our opinion is going to be one of the most predominant ways to decarbonize the aviation industry,” Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF, told Matador. “I think that’s the purpose of why we intended on going public is we wanted to add to the legitimacy. To bring visibility to what’s happening in our business but as well as what’s happening in the market.”

Technological improvements and availability are one step to a more sustainable industry, but won’t have the intended impact if it’s still too expensive to implement. XCF Global’s business plan is key to growing the sector as a whole. The company reduces costs by having its facility in a location near a source for various types of feedstocks like tallow, cooking oil, the waste byproduct distillers corn oil, and soybean oil.

Dange acknowledges the challenges but feels like his business, and SAF more broadly, is well-positioned for growth. Meeting the 2050 goal of a 70 percent decrease in carbon intensity will require roughly 100 times today’s infrastructure, he said, adding “we’re just not building infrastructure that fast.”

“I don’t consider [other SAF companies] competitors” in the bigger picture of a more sustainable future, Dange said. “We need as much staff infrastructure as we can to come online to help meet the demands of the future, to help reduce the carbon intensity around aviation.”

He argues that success depends on industry and regulators working together to create consistent global standards. Clear reporting and verification will not only move the sector forward but also build public trust — a view echoed by World Energy and Neste.

“We take our Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) calculations very seriously, conducting rigorous evaluations that account for full cradle-to-grave emissions and vetting them through independent third-party audits on an annual basis to ensure transparency and accuracy,” says Boyd, of World Energy. “This approach aligns with industry standards. Where properly certified SAF achieves at least a 50 percent lifecycle emissions reduction compared to conventional jet fuel, our SAF can achieve up to 85 percent in optimal cases using waste-based or advanced feedstocks.”

The case against sustainable aviation fuel

Sustainable aviation fuel isn’t without critics who point out that SAF comes with its own inherent climate risks. For one, corn requires an immense amount of land and water to grow.

Chuck Collins, director at the Institute for Policy Studies, is a vocal critic of SAF. He coauthored the 2024 report “Greenwashing the Skies” that argued SAF is largely a marketing ploy and not a scalable solution for aviation emissions. He and his coauthors point out that current SAF production is nowhere near what would be required to meet US climate goals, a valid stance.

The report notes that scaling up would demand massive subsidies and land-use changes, and that the aviation industry has a poor track record of meeting its own SAF targets. Collins also warns that including fuels like corn-based ethanol could worsen climate impacts due to land clearance and soil loss.

To produce enough corn-based ethanol to replace just 10 percent of current US jet fuel demand, corn yields and production methods would need major improvements. Replacing 100 percent of jet fuel with corn-based ethanol would be far more damaging and would require vast new cropland that reduces forests and strains water supplies.

Other vocal critics include airline executives themselves. AirAsia co-founder Tony Fernandes has called SAF “stupid”, and, like Collins and the IPS, questions its scalability given feedstock limitations and cost. Breeze Airways CEO David Neeleman agrees, telling Skift that SAF is economically and environmentally inadequate.

Collins and other SAF opponents call for rejecting ethanol-based SAF due to the harmful lifecycle impacts, and instead push for independent, science-driven research rather than what Collins has described as industry-influenced standards. His warning that turning farmland into fuel crops would be disastrous has merit, though it may overlook other viable SAF pathways.

Even industry players recognize these concerns – and are working to address them.

“Critics’ worries about scalability and environmental trade-offs, such as those from biofuel competition with food crops, are being addressed through evolving frameworks like ICAO’s sustainability criteria,” Boyd says. “Ultimately, dismissing SAF entirely overlooks its role in aviation’s net-zero pathway, but ongoing scrutiny drives improvements in production and certification to maximize real-world decarbonization.”

Embracing today’s solutions while building tomorrow’s

Waiting for researchers to develop a silver bullet solution is an increasingly less viable option as the effects of climate change speed up. Still, for SAF to be viable, more production methods need to be embraced to turn waste into energy.

One place to find inspiration is Denmark. Copenhagen’s CopenHill (Amager Bakke) plant burns the city’s non-recyclable waste in a high-efficiency incinerator, generating both electricity and hot water for tens of thousands of homes. If similar waste-to-energy plants were adapted to produce jet fuel using advanced filtration and catalytic systems to capture pollutants, the result could be cleaner than today’s kerosene while also diverting waste from landfills and cutting methane emissions. CopenHill is especially notable for its design: the plant doubles as a recreation space, with a ski slope, climbing wall, and hiking trails built into its sloping roof, helping secure public support.

Technology isn’t the only challenge to increasing production, however. Regulatory uncertainty remains one of the industry’s biggest roadblocks.

“The primary regulatory obstacles to scaling SAF production involve inconsistent international policies and varying sustainability criteria across jurisdictions, which can hinder compliance and deter investment in certain pathways or regions,” Boyd says.

She adds that regulatory uncertainty in both the US and EU, such as delays in tax credits and blending mandates, continues to slow progress. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) provides a framework to standardize international aviation emissions reductions, but its impact is limited by patchy participation and uneven carbon pricing.

The future for SAF – and what travelers can do now

The core takeaway is clear: For SAF to both scale and notably reduce the emissions of the aviation sector, production must be done responsibly with consistent global regulation and enactment.

For travelers, small steps matter too. Airlines including Alaska, JetBlue, and Turkish now allow flyers to “purchase” SAF credits at checkout, effectively only contributing a couple bucks to the cause but importantly voicing their support.

“I would emphasize that while some concerns are valid and highlight the need for careful pathway and feedstock selection,” Boyd says, “the evidence shows SAF can deliver substantial net GHG reductions when produced responsibly.”

For travelers from the US, a successful way forward involves educating both the public and lawmakers on the benefits, and supporting organizations, politicians, and individuals advocating for responsible development. Each step to replace fossil fuels with a more sustainable alternative is a step in the right direction. When SAF-powered long-hauls like Virgin’s Flight100 become the norm is still years or decades away – but in the broad stroke of human progress, this time is a blink of the eye.",https://cdn1.matadornetwork.com/blogs/1/2025/08/SAF-2463328421-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 22:57:06.001681

The proposed penalty on imports of feedstock will increase demand for domestically produced material, which will raise prices for oleochemical producers and others company that use natural oils to produce goods.

The following table shows the proposed RFS. The mandate volumes for each fuel is listed as renewable identification numbers (RINs), which is the unit of measurement used to determine compliance with the RFS. For ethanol, 1 RIN is equivalent to 1 gallon. For distillates, each gallon is worth more than 1 RIN to take into account their higher energy density.

Figures in the table are listed in billions of RINs.

2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Cellulosic biofuel 0.84 1.09 1.38 1.30 1.36 Biomass-based diesel 4.51 4.86 5.36 7.12 7.50 Advanced biofuel 5.94 6.54 7.33 9.02 9.46 Total renewable fuel 20.94 21.54 22.33 24.02 24.46 Implied conventional biofuels 15.00 15.00 15.00 15.00 15.00

The proposed RFS will increase costs in the following ways:

It will require more advanced biofuels to be blended into finished fuels. Advanced biofuels typically cost more.

It assumes that the same volume of conventional ethanol will be added into a shrinking domestic market for gasoline. This will require gasoline to contain higher concentrations of ethanol at a time when most service stations cannot handle fuels containing more than 10% ethanol. Companies will have to meet the RFS mandate by purchasing more expensive advanced biofuels biofuels such as renewable diesel.

Imported biofuels or domestic biofuels fuels made from imported feedstock will receive a 50% discount towards meeting the biofuel mandate. This proposed discount would further increase compliance costs if refiners cannot obtain domestic biofuels or feedstock.

Previous US policies already have raised biofuel costs. Tariffs have increased the costs of imported biofuels and the feedstocks needed to make them.

In addition, US companies have fewer tax incentives to increase biofuel capacity.

In all, the proposed RFS could increase compliance costs by nearly $70 billion annually in 2026 and 2027, according to studies commissioned by the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), a trade group that represents refiners. That is nearly twice as high as the previous record year for RFS compliance.

The small refinery exemptions that the US recently announced will do little – if anything – to offset the costs of the proposed RFS. Those exemptions did not lower the biofuel mandate. Instead, they exemptions simply reallocated the obligations from the small refiners to larger ones.

ETHANOL HITS BLENDING CEILING

Ideally, the fuel market would meet mandated volumes for total renewable fuels by blending conventional ethanol. Ethanol is typically cheaper than advanced fuels, and the proposed RFS assumes that this will happen.

The mandate implies that blenders will continue adding 15 billion gal/year of conventional ethanol in the years 2026 and 2027, a figure unchanged from 2023-2025.

However, US gasoline demand will continue declining, as shown in the following chart. Figures show millions of barrels per day of gasoline supplied to the US market.

Source: Energy Information Administration

To meet the mandate, finished gasoline will need to contain higher concentrations of ethanol, and fuel stations will need to the equipment necessary to store and distribute those higher blends.

The problem is most fuel stations in the US can handle gasoline with maximum ethanol blends of 10% (E10). A relatively small number of fuel stations have the equipment and infrastructure necessary to handle gasoline with blends of 15% ethanol (E15) and 85% ethanol (E85), as shown in the following table:

Total fueling stations 150,000 E15 3,000 E85 4,200

Sources: American Petroleum Institute (API), US Department of Energy (DoE)

The lack of fuel stations that can distribute E15 and E85 makes it difficult to blend more ethanol in a shrinking market for domestic gasoline.

US forecasts for fuel consumption acknowledge this ceiling on ethanol demand. They expect demand to decline, as shown in the following chart. Figures show millions of barrels/day of ethanol consumed in the US.

Source: EIA

Once the gasoline pool hits that ceiling for ethanol blending, blenders will have to meet the RFS mandate buy obtaining more expensive advanced biofuels such as biodiesel, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and cellulosic fuels.

In particular, renewable diesel and SAF have no blending limits, so the fuel market would face no physical constraints in using these fuels instead of conventional ethanol to meet their RFS mandates.

However, the AFPM wars that such a strategy could prove way more costly than using conventional ethanol. It accounts for half of the $70 billion in annual compliance costs, according to the AFPM studies.

IMPORTED BIOFUELS TO BECOME TWICE AS EXPENSIVE

Under the proposed RFS, imports of biofuels and domestic biofuels made from imported feedstock will receive a 50% discount towards meeting the biofuels mandate. In other words, it will be twice as expensive to rely on imported biofuels or feedstock to meet the proposed RFS mandates.

The discount on imported feedstock will have more widespread effects because the biofuel industry is just one of many sectors that use natural oils.

Oleochemical producers and other oil-dependent industries also rely on natural oils, so they will be competing with renewable fuels producers for limited quantities of domestic feedstock.

The effects of this feedstock displacement would be amplified if biofuel producers replace imports of used cooking oil with domestic oils.

Most of this used cooking oil is used to make biofuels, according to the business intelligence and analytical firm GlobalData.

Moreover, the US imports significant amounts of used cooking oil, as shown in the following chart. Figures are in kilograms and reflect 2024 imports for consumption under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) code 15180040.

Source: US International Trade Commission (figures in kilograms)

US TARIFFS INCREASE COMPLIANCE COSTS FOR DIESEL-TYPE BIOFUELS

Even without the RFS, compliance costs will likely increase because of tariffs, which the US has imposed on some of its largest suppliers of feedstock used to make biofuels.

In 2024, China was the largest US supplier of imports of used cooking oil, Brazil was the largest for tallow and Argentina for refined soybean oil.

The following chart shows the US 2024 trade balance for tallow (HTS code 150210) and refined soybean oil (HTS code 150710). Figures are in kilograms, and they show imports for consumption and domestic exports for 2024.

Source: ITC

The US could conceivably replace these imports with domestically produced soybean oil, but it will need to increase production and install crushing capacity to provide enough feedstock to offset the imports.

It will also present logistic challenges, since supply chains would need to be re-arranged to accommodate the new sources of feedstock.

If the new supply chains require domestic shipping, then the Jones Act could further increase costs because it requires shipping between US ports to be conducted by ships built, flagged, owned and crewed domestically.

US TAX CODE PROVIDES FEWER INCENTIVES FOR RENEWABLE FUELS

The US tax code is reducing its incentives for biofuel production, which will make it more expensive for companies to increase production to meet the larger mandate in the proposed RFS.

The biodiesel blender tax credit expired at the end of 2024. It provided a $1 tax incentive for each gallon of pure biodiesel or renewable diesel blended into petroleum-based diesel.

By contrast, the section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit (CFPC) provides a 35 cent/gal benefit for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and 20 cents/gal for all other fuel. The credit rises to $1.75/gal for SAF and $1.00/gal for all others for producers that meet prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. However, feedstocks must be sourced from the US, Canada or Mexico.

HOW THE RFS WORKS

The RFS requires that a mandated volume of biofuel is added to the nation’s fuel pool. The RFS distinguishes among the different types of biofuels by their feedstock, the process used to produce them and their effect on greenhouse gas emissions. The following table summarizes the different classes of biofuels.

Code Content Greenhouse Gas Reduction Renewable Fuel D-6 Any biomass, including corn starch At least 20% versus petroleum Advanced Biofuels D-5 Any renewable biomass except corn-starch-based ethanol At least 50% versus petroleum Biomass-based Diesel D-4 Biodiesel, renewable diesel At least 50% versus diesel Cellulosic biofuel D-3, D-7 Made from cellulose, hemicellulose or lignin At least 60% versus petroleum

Syzygy’s modular commercial plant, NovaSAF-1, located in Duranzo, Uruguay, is expected to produce more than 350,000 gallons of SAF per year. The NovaSAFTM platform can be replicated at over 50,000 biogas sites globally, helping scale affordable SAF production of abundant feedstock.

“Our innovative NovaSAF platform helps meet the growing demand for sustainable aviation fuels by achieving both high volumes and low price points, even as low as Jet-A parity under the right conditions,"" said Trevor Best, CEO and co-founder of Syzygy Plasmonics. ""With Honeywell’s hydrocracking technology, we can accelerate the development of our modular NovaSAF-1 plant, which will serve as a repeatable, scalable model for the future. This plant will show the world how profitable it can be to produce SAF from biogas waste streams combined with renewable energy.""

With traditional feedstocks in short supply, alternative production methods are important to produce renewable fuels. By 2030, the International Energy Agency predicts waste- and nonfood crop-based biofuels will supply over 40% of biofuel demand.1

“Honeywell continues to build on our hydrocracking technology, which we have pioneered for more than 70 years, while advancing the production of lower-carbon fuels for aviation,” said Rajesh Gattupalli, president of Honeywell UOP. “Syzygy’s modular construction paired with our proven, innovative technology demonstrates how biogas-to-SAF facilities can become more achievable and help improve waste-to-clean-energy conversion.

During an engaging session titled “Ag Sector Innovations – Powering Sustainable Solutions in the Aviation Industry,” the audience learned how crops and ethanol are being developed into sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) to help reduce emissions in one of the hardest-to-decarbonize sectors. Panelists highlighted innovations originating in the St. Louis region that are fueling progress on these efforts.

The inaugural Global Aerospace Summit was presented by the Leadership Council Southwestern Illinois in partnership with Madison County, St. Clair County, and Bi-State Development’s St. Louis Regional Freightway. It drew 400-plus industry leaders, educators, government officials, workforce development experts and career seekers who also learned about the St. Louis region’s aerospace assets, its potential for continued growth and innovation and various initiatives to grow the workforce.

The inaugural Global Aerospace Summit took place on Aug. 13 and 14, 2025, at the Regency Conference Center in O'Fallon, IL.

The panel was moderated by Andy Banker, anchor and reporter with KTVI Fox 2, and featured Dr. Yan Zhang, interim center director and director of research for the National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Center (NCERC) on the campus of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, and Jim Hedges, CEO of St. Louis-based CoverCress, Inc. (CCI).

Dr. Zhang explained that since its opening in 2003, NCERC’s focus has expanded from corn-to-ethanol production to scaling up technologies for biopolymers and various other fuels, including SAF. She noted that NCERC is working on the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) pathway, one of eight approved processes for SAF.

“Among the eight pathways in this country, the ATJ is actually a very, very promising way to make a jet fuel to meet the 3-billion-gallon per year mark by 2030 in this country using ethanol from corn starch,” Zhang said. “However, right now there are some challenges. We are not there yet.”

She said the No. 1 challenge the corn-to-ethanol industry is working on is trying to lower the carbon intensity score. “For us, we just need to push a little bit more on the reduction of carbon dioxide emission from fermentation,” Zhang said. “NCERC has a demo-scale project planned in six months. If the results look okay, we will contribute a lot to the development.”

Hedges described how CoverCress Inc., an ag-tech company, is converting a once-noxious weed into a commercially viable crop for renewable fuel. “In a startup world, don’t build a solution in search of a problem. At CCI, we have built a solution to answer a problem,” Hedges said. “The problem is there’s a huge demand for renewable fuel, in this case sustainable aviation fuel. The demand is going to outpace what we can do as an individual company or as a crop. We don’t view other crops as competitors. We want to lift all these solutions up to fulfill the demand, so that the demand doesn’t go away because there’s a lack of solutions.”

He explained that CoverCress, the company’s main crop, is the first new crop introduced in the industry since canola about 60 years ago. It grows between corn and soybean seasons, creating a new revenue stream for farmers while improving soil health.

Hedges highlighted the strategic advantages of the St. Louis region for SAF research and development. “I've been in five different startups and I’ve never had the level of talent that I have at CCI,” said Hedges. “The ecosystem of Ag Tech in St. Louis rivals anything in the United States.” He highlighted the proximity to key agricultural stakeholders, access to talent, and a strong innovation community through the Danforth Plant Science Center, 39 North, and BioSTL noting that the local ag-tech ecosystem makes it possible to connect research, commercialization, and farmers efficiently.

Beyond improving carbon intensity scores, both speakers also addressed additional barriers to scaling up SAF production, including retrofitting facilities and encouraging farmers to adopt new crops, and delivering fuel at a competitive cost. But Hedges indicated the change for farmers is very minor, essentially just a few adjustments on the harvesting equipment around small grains. “The grain infrastructure, as it is, is robust and it will satisfy, but we're going to have to do some adaptation to that infrastructure,” he said. “As we start to scale the product into the hundreds of thousands of acres and into the millions of acres, it's super competitive; competitive enough that the investors we have are Bayer, Chevron and Bunge.”

Despite the challenges, both panelists expressed optimism about the growing market for sustainable fuels from both commercial and military aviation. Dr. Zhang noted, “We are very proud that my team actually got funding through the Department of Defense to research making SAF-qualified ethanol with feedstocks from Hawaii and tropical islands in the Pacific Ocean. We have the trust and we can do a good job for the future.”

The session also explored the timeline for adoption of SAF in aviation. Both panelists stressed that while the industry is still in its early stages, demand is strong and commitments from industrial partners are real. “We’re at the infancy of that shift,” Hedges said. “Every industrial company involved in aviation is committed, and the funding and innovation will help change the next generation of travel and fuel. As we start into that process of helping deliver on the demand, I can't even imagine how much different it's going be 10 years from now.”

Dr. Zhang emphasized the importance of progress for future generations, noting that, as a mother of two, she can see ahead how the next generation will benefit from these changes. “It’s hard to predict exactly how quickly aviation fuels will evolve, but if you have the energy and talent to contribute to change, it feels good to be part of it,” she said.

Banker called attention to Avina Clean Hydrogen’s plan to develop a $280 million SAF facility in the Metro East. “We're eager to see that project moving forward and look forward to seeing what great new milestones lie ahead for today’s panelists and the rest of this burgeoning SAF industry.”

The Thailand Taxonomy is a national classification framework that divides economic activities into three tiers—green, amber, and red—based on their level of environmental sustainability. Currently, it applies to six key sectors that are major contributors to Thailand’s greenhouse gas emissions: energy, transport, agriculture, manufacturing, construction and real estate, and waste management. For businesses, the Thailand Taxonomy provides several advantages. It strengthens credibility with investors and trading partners by enabling firms to disclose the proportion of revenues and investments aligned with the Taxonomy. In addition, it offers a roadmap for companies to adjust their operations toward greater sustainability, thereby improving their access to sustainable finance. However, although adoption of the Taxonomy is still voluntary, its establishment brings both pressure and challenges for the private sector in two critical areas: (1) collecting and reporting business data consistent with the Taxonomy, and (2) transforming business models toward sustainability, including securing internationally recognized sustainability certifications.

Understanding the Thailand Taxonomy: A Standard for Classifying Sustainable Economic Activities

As the climate crisis intensifies, the world is accelerating its transition toward achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Thailand is no exception, having publicly committed on the global stage to reach net-zero emissions by 2065. In response, the government has been advancing green legislation and regulations, such as the Climate Change Act and a carbon tax. At the same time, the private sector is increasingly proactive, responding to pressures from both domestic and international measures, including the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). As a result, we have seen more organizations setting net-zero targets and investing in carbon reduction projects, which has, in turn, fueled rapid growth in the green finance market that supports environmentally friendly investments.

Amid this expansion, the risk of greenwashing arises when businesses claim to be “green” without actually reducing their environmental impact. This makes it difficult for financial institutions, investors, and consumers to accurately identify genuinely sustainable activities. The Thailand Taxonomy was introduced as a tool to screen and classify environmentally sustainable economic activities, enhancing transparency in the sustainable finance market and supporting the country’s net-zero ambitions.

This article focuses on exploring the Thailand Taxonomy, which was most recently launched in May 2025, and evaluates its benefits, impacts, challenges, and opportunities for stakeholders across various economic sectors.

What is the Thailand Taxonomy?

The Thailand Taxonomy is a classification framework that defines and categorizes economic activities based on their environmental impact. It applies technical screening criteria to determine whether an activity qualifies as environmentally friendly.1/ While the Taxonomy primarily emphasizes environmental criteria, activities that align with it must also meet broader sustainability requirements, taking into account both environmental and social dimensions. Specifically:

Contribution to Environmental Objectives: Activities must make a substantial contribution to at least one of six environmental objectives, namely, (1) Climate Change Mitigation, (2) Climate Change Adaptation, (3) Sustainable Use and Protection of Water Resources, (4) Transition to a Circular Economy and Sustainable Resource Use, (5) Pollution Prevention and Control, and (6) Protection and Restoration of Ecosystems and Biodiversity.

Do No Significant Harm (DNSH): Activities must not cause significant adverse impacts on the remaining five environmental objectives.

Minimum Social Safeguards (MSS): Activities must uphold social considerations, including human rights, labor rights, community well-being, and cultural heritage, in line with international standards such as the International Labour Organization (ILO) Core Conventions and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

For instance, a wind power project may contribute significantly to reducing carbon emissions, yet if it generates excessive noise that disturbs wildlife or involves unfair labor practices, it will not qualify under DNSH and MSS. In such cases, the responsible entity must prepare and implement a remediation plan within three years; otherwise, the project will be considered non-aligned with the Taxonomy.

Assessing the Benefits and Impacts of the Thailand Taxonomy

Benefits

The Thailand Taxonomy serves as a tool for classifying the sustainability of economic activities, available for voluntary use by all sectors. It is expected to generate positive outcomes for businesses, the financial sector, and the country as a whole, including:

1. Businesses gain guidance for their transition and greater opportunities to access sustainable financing.

Businesses are likely to benefit from the Taxonomy in several ways, such as:

Improving corporate image through Taxonomy-aligned reporting: Companies can enhance their reputation by disclosing the proportion of revenues and expenditures aligned with the Taxonomy, potentially attracting sustainability-conscious investors, partners, and customers. For example, B.Grimm Power PCL reported that in 2024, although only 7% of its revenue came from green activities due to its traditional power plant structure, 67% of its capital expenditure (CapEx) was allocated to green initiatives, reflecting its commitment to clean energy technology development.3/

Guiding business transition towards sustainability: Organizations can use the Taxonomy as a roadmap for improving energy efficiency, reducing carbon intensity, managing supply chains, and encouraging partners to align with the defined criteria. Early adoption of sustainable practices also helps mitigate transition risks associated with increasingly stringent green regulations.

Opening doors to green business opportunities: The Taxonomy facilitates engagement in sectors such as electric vehicles and related infrastructure, renewable energy components, climate technology, and sustainability services, including carbon assessment, consulting, and verification, which are essential for demonstrating compliance with the Taxonomy.

Enhancing access to sustainable finance: Activities aligned with the Taxonomy are more likely to secure funding. Green activities—whether improving existing operations or investing in new projects—can access green loans or issue green bonds. Amber activities can also obtain transition loans or bonds. Furthermore, businesses could benefit from government-planned climate funds designed to support private sector investment in carbon-reducing technologies through loans or grants, with the Taxonomy expected to serve as a key eligibility criterion.

2. Financial sector receives a framework to assess risks and design sustainable financial products.

The financial sector can use the Taxonomy as a guide to design financial products that support the transition of Thai businesses and to develop strategies for funding companies aligned with the net zero pathway. For example, banks may review and adjust their lending portfolios to increase green financing, while investment funds may shift allocations toward businesses that comply with the Taxonomy. In addition, the Taxonomy serves as a common tool for effectively assessing risks associated with sustainable financial products and mitigating greenwashing, thereby supporting the sustainable growth of Thailand’s sustainable finance sector.

The sustainable finance market in Thailand has shown continuous growth. As of July 31, 2025, the outstanding value of ESG bonds4/ stood at THB 910 billion, nearly 40 times higher than in 2019 (Figure 4)5/, with more than half of this amount raised by the energy and transport sectors. However, ESG bonds still account for only 5.3% of total bonds6/, highlighting substantial room for further expansion, with the Taxonomy expected to play a key role in driving sustainable finance. This is reflected by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) waiving registration fees for Sustainability-Linked Bonds (SLBs) aligned with the Thailand or ASEAN Taxonomy from June 1, 2025, to May 31, 20287/, which enhances the appeal of these financial instruments.

3. Thailand is equipped with a tool to drive the green economy and advance national sustainability goals.

Government agencies can design climate change regulations and policies based on the technical criteria of the Taxonomy. This tool also provides guidance for directing investments toward green businesses and low-carbon technologies. Together, these will help support the achievement of national sustainability targets, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30–40% from business-as-usual (BAU) levels by 2030, achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and reaching net-zero emissions by 2065.

Impacts and challenges

The Thailand Taxonomy creates impacts and challenges for various sectors in two main areas: (1) data collection and reporting, and (2) the transition toward sustainability, as outlined below.

1. Business data collection and reporting under the Taxonomy

Although adoption of the Thailand Taxonomy is currently voluntary, businesses may face peer pressure from other industry players to disclose information categorized by green, amber, and red activities. This includes reporting proportions of revenues, capital expenditure (CapEx), operating expenditure (OpEx), supplier shares, bank lending portfolios, and investment fund allocations. Furthermore, businesses may be subject to mandatory reporting obligations in the future, similar to those required under the EU Taxonomy.

In addition to financial reporting, businesses also face challenges in collecting technical environmental data required to demonstrate compliance with the Thailand Taxonomy. Such data include greenhouse gas emissions8/, the percentage of energy efficiency improvements, water savings, and information on compliance with social and labor standards. However, most Thai companies are still developing their carbon measurement capabilities. Among companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand, only about half currently disclose carbon footprint data. Disclosure is most common in the energy, transport, and agribusiness sectors, while smaller firms report at roughly half the rate of larger firms.9/ As a result, the Taxonomy may exert pressure on businesses to invest in sustainability data collection processes, requiring financial resources and skilled personnel, which disproportionately affects smaller enterprises.

2. The business transition toward sustainability

Thai businesses are increasingly under pressure to align their operations with the high environmental and social standards set by the Taxonomy. This transition is expected to raise costs in two main areas: (1) investment in green technologies such as renewable energy, hydraulic cement, green steel, and low-emission rice farming, which remain more expensive than conventional, carbon-intensive alternatives—for example, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is currently priced at two to three times the cost of traditional jet fuel; and (2) obtaining sustainability certifications, which serve as proof of compliance with the Taxonomy criteria, particularly for companies in real estate and agriculture where certification provides a viable pathway to meeting the Taxonomy’s standards.

While the transition will initially be gradual, urgency will mount as Thailand approaches its climate commitments. In 2022, Thailand’s net greenhouse gas emissions—after accounting for forest carbon absorption—stood at 278 million tons of CO₂ equivalent (MtCO₂e).10/ This figure remains far from net zero and emissions are expected to continue rising in the post-COVID recovery (Figure 5).

At the sectoral level, each industry under the Taxonomy faces distinct transition challenges. Transport and industrial sectors continue to record rising emissions, whereas the energy sector shows a downward trend thanks to its growing reliance on renewables. Nonetheless, energy remains the highest-emitting sector and thus faces sustained pressure to decarbonize further. Agriculture poses another major challenge. It accounts for 17.9% of emissions—only behind energy and transport—and is characterized by a dominance of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which make up as much as 99.8% of the sector.11/

Ultimately, firms in sectors unable to transition (red) or only able to transition slowly (dark amber/brown) may find it difficult to remain competitive. Not only could access to finance become more constrained, but buyers and consumers are also likely to shift toward more sustainable alternatives.

Sectoral Deep Dive: Opportunities and Challenges under the Thailand Taxonomy

Because the classification of activities varies across economic sectors—depending on factors such as their significance in greenhouse gas emissions and the availability of green technologies—businesses under the Thailand Taxonomy face different opportunities and challenges. The sector-specific details are as follows:

Energy

The energy sector is the highest-emitting sector in Thailand, with electricity and heat production alone accounting for 21.4% of the country’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Accordingly, most activities under the Taxonomy focus on energy generation from various sources, as well as related activities such as storage, transmission, and distribution. A key criterion for classifying energy-sector activities is the greenhouse gas intensity per unit of energy produced. Green activities include electricity generation from solar, wind, marine, and waste heat. For natural gas, biomass, bioenergy, hydropower, and combined-heat-and-power plants, green classification requires meeting emission thresholds and/or other criteria, such as the feedstock used for bioenergy or the power density of hydropower plants.12/ Amber criteria generally require upgrading existing power plants to reduce carbon emissions in line with the net-zero transition pathway. Finally, activities involving fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, are classified as red.

The Taxonomy underscores that the energy sector must lead the transition to net zero, as reliance on carbon-intensive energy increases the indirect emissions of other sectors. This has driven a clear shift from fossil fuels toward renewable energy over recent years. Comparing commercial bank lending data from 2019 to 202413/ reveals a significant contraction in outstanding loans: coal mining fell by -41.5% (averaging -10.2% per year), and crude oil and natural gas extraction declined by -74.3% (-23.8% per year), reflecting the banking sector’s continued reduction of financial support for fossil fuels.

At the same time, energy companies demonstrate strong sustainability awareness, evidenced by their dominant share in the sustainable bond market—accounting for roughly 30% of total outstanding bonds—primarily from large players such as Global Power Synergy PCL (GPSC), Ratch Group PCL, and BCPG PCL. The Taxonomy not only pressures these businesses to accelerate their transition but also facilitates access to sustainable finance, particularly for renewable energy ventures that are poised for high growth amid rising global clean energy demand and are key targets for banking sector support. Nevertheless, renewable energy projects must comply with the Taxonomy’s comprehensive environmental criteria, including noise control for wind turbines and designing solar panels and other renewable energy systems for durability, ease of maintenance, and recyclability according to international standards.

Transport

The transport sector accounts for about one-fifth of the country’s total greenhouse gas emissions, making it the second-largest emitter after the energy sector. Accordingly, the Taxonomy applies carbon emission criteria and considers the availability of low-carbon technologies, which vary across different modes of transport. In general, green activities require the use of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), such as battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and hydrogen-powered vehicles14/, or the use of low-carbon fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), while also prohibiting activities that support fossil fuel use. Amber activities typically set annual maximum carbon emission limits, which gradually decrease to zero by 2040 (Sunset Date) (Figure 7).

Within the transport sector, land transport businesses—such as passenger services, public transit, and freight—are expected to be most affected by the Thailand Taxonomy, as they collectively account for more than 96% of transport-related carbon emissions. This segment is also where low-carbon vehicle technologies have advanced the furthest, compelling businesses to transition toward ZEVs to remain aligned with the Taxonomy. The next most affected subsector is aviation, which ranks second in carbon emissions. Airlines are therefore encouraged to increase the use of SAF, even though its cost remains higher than conventional jet fuel. Nonetheless, this pressure may facilitate compliance with international aviation requirements such as CORSIA15/, which aims to reduce global aviation emissions. At the same time, businesses across various industries will find opportunities to invest in infrastructure that supports low-carbon transportation—spanning road, water, air, and rail.

In terms of sustainable finance activity, the transport sector has demonstrated significant momentum, ranking second only to the energy sector in sustainable bond issuance. Leading examples include BTS Group Holdings PCL and Bangkok Expressway and Metro PCL (BEM), both of which have leveraged the Taxonomy to access financing. For instance, BEM has applied the Taxonomy framework in issuing bonds and securing loans for the development of environmentally friendly transport systems, totaling more than THB 34 billion during 2021-2024.16/

Agriculture

Unlike other sectors, the classification of agricultural activities under the Thailand Taxonomy does not employ the traffic-light system. This is largely due to challenges in defining technical screening criteria—for example, measuring carbon emissions at the farm level—stemming from limitations in data availability and completeness. Instead, the Taxonomy applies a practice-based approach to assess sustainable agriculture. Currently, it covers eight subsectors: rice, sugarcane, oil palm, rubber, cassava, other crops, livestock, and aquaculture. For each subsector, sustainable practices are categorized into three levels: basic, intermediate, and advanced.17/ Farmers or project developers are required to adopt at least two practices, of which at least one must be intermediate or advanced. Projects may then proceed through either of two pathways:",https://www.krungsri.com/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-28 12:56:28.684715

One of the latest developments: jet fuel made from corn.

Corn-based Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) takes biofuels to a new level beyond ethanol production. It actually begins with ethanol, which is then enhanced via “Alcohol-to-Jet” pathways to form a fuel suitable for aviation.

According to the American Coalition for Ethanol, SAF is “a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel that could be used in today’s aircraft and immediately improve the environmental impact of flight.” Relying on renewable sources like corn, SAF is said to deliver equivalent performance to petroleum-based jet fuel with a fraction of its carbon footprint, and is suitable to use in today’s existing aircraft engines and infrastructure.

At an estimated 80% reduction in overall CO2 lifecycle emissions compared to fossil fuels, SAF promises to drive the “decarbonization” of air travel.

Like ethanol, corn-based SAF could yield massive quantities of co-products. The U.S. livestock industry is poised to embrace those resources, according to Dr. Kurt Rosentrater, Professor of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering at Iowa State University.

On a recent episode of The Dairy Podcast Show, Rosentrater noted that after just two decades, dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) have become a widely implemented staple in animal nutrition.

“When the ethanol industry was in its earliest stages, I remember having conversations with companies saying, ‘in a couple of years, we’re going to be dealing with 10 million tons of DDGS. What are we going to do with all of that? We’re going to have to burn it and landfill it,’” he recalled. “Well, right now we’re sitting at about 33-35 million tons per year, and we’re not landfilling it, we’re not burning it. We’re using it in beef, dairy, swine, fish, and pet foods, plus we’re exporting about a third of it.”

Butter plunged to a new year-to-date low, while cheese prices continue to bounce.

Rosentrater credited dairy and livestock nutritionists with optimizing ingredients like DDGS for a variety of species. At the same time, ethanol manufacturers have fine-tuned production practices to create more consistent, specialized, and high-quality co-products.

He expects that same ingenuity to prevail if corn (and also potentially soybeans) is channeled at a large scale into SAF production. “In the past few years, there has been a big push among lots of different organizations about the idea of the ‘circular economy,’” he shared. “I laugh at that, because, in agriculture, we’ve been doing the circular economy for generations.”

The first commercial-scale facility converting U.S. corn into SAF is currently slated to be in the dairy-boom state of South Dakota. Gevo’s Net-Zero 1 plant near Lake Preston, SD, is projected to produce an estimated annual 60 million gallons of SAF, plus an accompanying 1.32 billion pounds of protein and animal feed and 30 million pounds of corn oil.

Although the South Dakota plant was initially slated to begin production in 2025, delays in financing and carbon pipeline approval/access have stalled the project.

Still, proponents of SAF note that airlines have already made commitments to purchase sustainable fuels to offset their carbon footprints. And they argue that using only the starch fraction of corn for fuel, while preserving the protein and nutrients for livestock feed, helps negate “fuel-versus- fuel” debates.",https://assets.farmjournal.com/dims4/default/abdde3b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1125+0+4/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-farm-journal.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F89%2F2d%2F4bbbc4e849dc96b3f7f4a590c76c%2Fadobestock-1222109492.jpeg,N,,2025-08-28 11:57:33.551709

KOTA KINABALU: A new Used Cooking Oil (UCO) Collection Competition has been launched for schools in Kota Kinabalu, turning household waste into an opportunity for environmental education, recycling, and community action.

Organised by the Ministry of Plantation and Commodities in collaboration with the Kota Kinabalu Parliamentary Service Centre, Kota Kinabalu City Hall (DBKK), and JCI Kota Kinabalu, the competition runs from 28 August to 27 October 2025 and is open to both primary and secondary schools.

Attractive cash prizes await the winners, with RM1,000 for first place, RM800 for second, and RM500 for third in each school category.

Kaven Lee Seng Vui, Private Secretary to the Deputy Minister of Plantation and Commodities and Chief Liaison Officer for Kota Kinabalu Parliament, said the initiative aims to instil good waste management practices while highlighting the economic and environmental value of recycling.

“Used cooking oil should not be treated as waste. When collected properly, it prevents clogged drains and pollution, while also supporting the circular economy through biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel production,” Lee said.

He added that the competition also helps nurture a green culture among students, teachers, and the wider community, demonstrating that responsible waste management can contribute to Malaysia’s broader sustainability goals, including its target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Beyond protecting the environment, Lee stressed that the competition shows young people how recycling can generate additional income and create shared responsibility across households and schools.

“This is about teaching the next generation that what we call rubbish may, in fact, have value.

The expansion of the Qantas Group’s largest ever fleet renewal programme will see 16 of the 20 additional A321XLRs configured with lie-flat Business seats and seat back entertainment screens to serve longer routes, including transcontinental services to and from Perth and short and medium haul international routes.

The new configuration A321XLRs will begin arriving in calendar year 2028, taking the airline’s total order for the next generation A321XLR to 48 aircraft.

The extended range of up to 8,700 kilometres is more than 3,000 kilometres further than the Boeing 737 it replaces and will enable Qantas to launch direct flights to destinations across South East Asia and the Pacific Islands that are not currently viable.

Qantas’ first two A321XLRs, which are configured for domestic and short haul international flying, are expected to start operating commercial flights in mid-September, making Qantas the first airline in the Asia Pacific to operate the aircraft type. The aircraft will initially operate on Sydney-Melbourne and Sydney-Perth and be progressively rolled out on other routes. By the end of this financial year Qantas will have seven of the aircraft type.

Jetstar’s A321XLRs will begin to arrive from calendar year 2027 and will be fitted with a two-class cabin to suit international travel.

Qantas Group CEO Vanessa Hudson said the expansion of the A321XLR fleet represented a significant step in the Group’s fleet renewal programme: “Investing in new aircraft is one of the most significant ways that we can provide our customers with a better flying experience and these billion-dollar investments are possible because of our continued strong financial performance.

“These additional A321XLRs will accelerate the retirement of our 737 fleet and open up new opportunities for domestic and international travel, allowing us to reach destinations that aren’t possible with our current narrowbody fleet.

“Not only will the A321XLRs help us serve the corporate market travelling between Perth and the east coast of Australia, they will also allow us to expand flying on existing routes into South East Asia and open up new possibilities like Perth-India and Adelaide-Singapore.

“The lie-flat Business seats, seat back screens and fast and free Wi-Fi will provide a consistent premium experience for our customers who fly domestically with Qantas and connect onto our long haul services.

“All of the next generation aircraft joining our fleet benefit from longer range, more comfort, less noise, better economics and will improve how people travel around Australia and overseas. It also means we’re recruiting and training more pilots, cabin crew and engineers, creating opportunities for our people.”

Fleet Overview

The Group’s total firm aircraft order now stands at 214 aircraft, with 32 delivered as at 30th June, representing a multibillion dollar investment in renewing and growing Qantas and Jetstar’s fleet. In addition to these firm orders, the Group has additional purchase right options with Airbus and Boeing which provide flexibility for future growth.

The airline took delivery of 17 new aircraft in FY25. This increases to 20 new aircraft arriving this financial year and 29 in FY27, including 36 for Qantas, 10 for Jetstar and three for Qantas Freight.

The first Project Sunrise A350-1000ULR will move to Airbus’ final assembly line in October this year, with deliveries commencing from October 2026.

The introduction of new aircraft is already delivering significant improvements in customer satisfaction, as well as financial and fuel benefits for the Group.

As with all Airbus aircraft, the A321XLR aircraft is already able to operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Airbus is targeting to have its aircraft capable of flying with up to 100% SAF by 2030.",,N,,2025-08-28 11:57:49.590388

Acceptance validates proven technical capability and production scale required for Clearinghouse qualification

Milestone positions Unifuel as a credible pathway towards 100% drop-in SAF for commercial airline adoption

As the global aviation industry faces mounting pressure to reduce emissions while demand for air travel continues to grow, Universal Fuel Technologies' (Unifuel) Ethanol-to-jet sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced via the company’s Flexiforming technology has been accepted into the ASTM D4054 Clearinghouse, which supports the technical evaluation of new aviation fuels, for qualification. This acceptance positions Unifuel among an exclusive group of companies advancing toward ASTM qualification, the essential gateway for new fuels to enter commercial aviation markets.

""The acceptance into the D4054 Clearinghouse is an important validation of our Flexiforming technology and significantly derisks our road to approval for commercial use,"" said Alexei Beltyukov, CEO of Universal Fuel Technologies. ""This advancement indicates that our SAF can meet the toughest performance standards without sacrificing scalability or quality, and has technical credibility in the eyes of industry experts.""

The ASTM D4054 evaluation process is the aviation industry’s framework for ensuring that new fuels can safely power aircraft engines. It includes multiple tiers of testing, data collection, and technical review by experts from leading aerospace companies. Acceptance into the D4054 Clearinghouse requires demonstrating, by independent testing, that a fuel is not only technically credible and can be produced at a meaningful scale, but also that it has met strict quality and safety criteria.

""We accept candidate fuels into the D4054 Clearinghouse that show strong potential for completing the ASTM qualification process successfully,"" said Dr. Zachary West, D4054 Clearinghouse Director. ""This marks a significant milestone for Universal Fuel Technologies towards their goal of commercial acceptance.”

The acceptance follows a successful five-month pilot project where the company produced nearly 100 liters of sample material for four different SAF pathways under stable process conditions. The campaign focused on converting methanol and ethanol, and ethanol with paraffinic renewable naphtha made via Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), into SAF. The samples then underwent comprehensive testing by Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences and Engineering Lab, the world-leading authority on SAF research.

""The acceptance into the D4054 Clearinghouse confirms that Flexiforming can produce high-quality synthetic aviation turbine fuel with a clear route to ASTM qualification,"" said Denis Pchelintsev, Co-Founder of Universal Fuel Technologies. ""We're positioned to support the aviation industry's urgent need for cost-effective synthetic aviation turbine fuel that doesn't compromise on performance or safety.""

Following Unifuel’s D4054 Clearinghouse acceptance, the company will proceed with producing larger fuel samples for detailed Tier 1 and Tier 2 testing required for ASTM qualification. The initial qualification could come as soon as the end of 2026 as a blend component with fossil jet. From there, further testing is planned, with the goal of leading to a 100% drop-in fully synthetic jet fuel in the future.

Unifuel's advancement through the qualification process is supported by Flexiforming's unique capabilities, which upgrade various renewable feedstocks—including ethanol, methanol, renewable naphthas, and liquefied petroleum gas—into high-quality SAF. In ethanol-to-jet applications, Flexiforming uses 75% less energy and 33% less hydrogen than other processes, cutting production costs by up to 50%. The technology is also valuable as a complementary process, upgrading low-value naphtha byproduct from HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch processes into high-value aromatic SAF, creating new revenue opportunities for renewable fuel producers.

Que: WOG maintains a strong R&D culture, including pilot and demonstration units from bench-scale to onsite deployment.
Can you tell us about a standout pilot project that led to its commercial adoption, particularly in the renewable energy sector?
Ans: India presents a significant opportunity for various renewable energy technologies, with central and state governments now proactively supporting such initiatives through policy interventions.
Que: Given the evolving landscape of the circular economy and decarbonisation, what emerging technologies or market segments are you exploring next within renewable energy?","Que: Nearly half of WOG’s ~200 global projects convert industrial effluent into Bio-CNG. What is your roadmap to scale this model, both domestically and internationally?

Ans: Bio-CNG has a very promising future. Domestically, we are very bullish on Bio-CNG, and with supportive central and state government policies, we are planning multiple Bio-Methane/CNG plants in the country. On the international front, WOG has already delivered many successful biomethane plants.

Que: WOG’s five-pronged innovation suite includes Compressed Biogas, Biochar, Pyrolysis, Torrefaction, and Sewage-to-Hydrogen systems. Which of these technologies has shown the greatest commercial traction so far, and why?

Ans: Commercially, Bio-CNG is already being produced by many players, with close to 100 operational plants across the country. Among all options, torrefaction holds high potential due to the central government’s mandate on biomass-based fuel blending at TPPs and the presence of over 100 potential TPPs that will require this. Hard-to-abate CO₂-emitting sectors, such as steel, are already conducting trials with biochar to replace pulverised coal in blast furnaces and sintering plants. Sewage-to-hydrogen is still a work in progress, and the technology is expected to mature over the next 2–3 years.

Que: WOG’s end-to-end model, from feedstock assessment to off-take, is said to secure multiple revenue streams through energy, fertilisers, carbon credits, and compost. Could you share how this integrated approach enhances project viability and stakehold

Ans: This is a prime example of circularity. Biomass feedstock is valorised either as a renewable, carbon-neutral energy source through torrefaction, as carbon-dense biochar for industries seeking to replace fossil coal as much as possible, or sequestered back into the soil as organic fertiliser, enhancing soil organic carbon, improving water retention, and supporting nutrient uptake by plants, while earning carbon credits in the process. There is a revenue stream at every stage, whether from supplying renewable energy or returning it to the soil.

Que: WOG maintains a strong R&D culture, including pilot and demonstration units from bench-scale to onsite deployment. Can you tell us about a standout pilot project that led to its commercial adoption, particularly in the renewable energy sector?

Ans: Through its strong R&D and innovative process solutions culture, WOG has already addressed several industry challenges, including eliminating the use of millions of tonnes of acids in the textile industry, reducing 17 process steps to just 2 in the oil and gas industry, saving several million dollars in OPEX annually, and achieving over 90 percent conversion of organics into bio-methane/Bio-CNG. WOG is currently working on five major industry challenges in its R&D, with a primary focus on bioenergy and circularity solutions for the bioenergy sector. The company is also in the process of building the next generation of its R&D laboratory and technology centre.

Que: What is your roadmap for globalising your renewable energy footprint beyond India?

Ans: India presents a significant opportunity for various renewable energy technologies, with central and state governments now proactively supporting such initiatives through policy interventions. Many of these technologies, such as CBG using feedstocks like MSW and Napier grass; biochar through pyrolysis of multiple feedstocks including bamboo; torrefaction; green hydrogen; SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel); and SMF (Sustainable Marine Fuels) are under active consideration. Once the initial projects are successfully deployed, we are confident of replicating their success in overseas markets.

Que: Given the evolving landscape of the circular economy and decarbonisation, what emerging technologies or market segments are you exploring next within renewable energy?

Ans: The Indian government is committed to achieving a 50 percent contribution of renewable energy sources in the total energy basket by 2030. While the 20 percent ethanol blending target has already been met, the CBG industry is witnessing steady growth. The key now is to introduce technology interventions that improve yields and make the bottom line more attractive for investors. Replacing fossil coal with renewable, carbon-neutral fuel presents another promising opportunity. Just as the solar industry received an initial government push, similar support for biomass manufacturers could accelerate industry growth. With abundant and diverse agro-biomass available across the country, high-carbon-density biochar, both for sequestration and for replacing fossil fuel in the steel industry, emerges as another strong opportunity over the next 2–5 years.",https://www.energetica-india.net/images/entrevistas/Qr8FIKJQlKnYmskuic2Xa7lWENzz3Fj7KrGU9rekFFRqz1IqMipII.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 15:57:17.529890

In a significant step towards sustainable logistics, Shein has partnered with Lufthansa Cargo to reduce aviation emissions. This collaboration will see Shein use carbon credits linked to alternative aviation fuels within the next six months. At its core, the partnership aims to accelerate the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and explore wider solutions to cut carbon from global air freight.

The Memorandum of Understanding between the two companies signals a broader ambition to decarbonise transportation networks while making emissions tracking more credible and transparent.

How the Agreement Works

Lufthansa Cargo will issue certificates to Shein confirming its use of alternative aviation fuels. These certificates are aligned with independent verification standards, giving assurance that the fuels emit fewer greenhouse gases across their lifecycle compared to traditional jet fuel.

Although these fuels may not be physically powering flights carrying Shein goods, the certificates allow Shein to account for these reductions in its corporate reporting. Within six months, Shein plans to integrate these credits into its offsetting approach, while continuing to expand the partnership with longer term goals.

The Role of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

What is SAF

Sustainable aviation fuel is a renewable or waste-derived fuel that can be blended with conventional jet fuel. It is seen as the most viable near-term solution for reducing aviation emissions, especially for long-haul flights where electrification or hydrogen technologies remain years away.

Current Limitations

The uptake of SAF is limited by cost and supply. At present, it is several times more expensive than kerosene, and most flights only use small blends due to availability constraints. Still, industry experts see SAF as a critical bridge technology until other low-carbon propulsion systems mature.

Beyond the Fuel

SAF is part of a larger sustainability picture. Both Shein and Lufthansa have highlighted the need to combine fuel innovation with route optimisation, logistics efficiency, and a shift to lower carbon modes of transport such as rail and shipping when possible.

Addressing the Bigger Emissions Picture

While the SAF partnership is a visible step, Shein’s broader emissions profile reveals the scale of the challenge. Between 2021 and 2023, the company’s emissions rose sharply, with 96 percent of its footprint tied to purchased goods and upstream transport.

In response, Shein has developed a decarbonisation roadmap that includes:

Reducing air and trucking distances by optimising routes

Supporting trucking partners in adopting fuel-efficient vehicles

Increasing reliance on road and sea freight where possible

This strategy, developed with sustainability consultancy Anthesis Group, underlines the importance of a multi-pronged approach rather than reliance on a single solution.

Why This Matters for the Future of Aviation

Partnerships like the one between Shein and Lufthansa Cargo show how companies in very different sectors can collaborate to tackle complex sustainability challenges. Aviation is a hard-to-abate sector, and progress requires both industry leadership and collective responsibility across the supply chain.

This collaboration also highlights the importance of transparent emissions reporting. By aligning with third-party verification standards, companies can demonstrate progress in ways that build credibility and trust with regulators, partners, and consumers.

Conclusion

The partnership between Shein and Lufthansa Cargo is more than a business agreement. It reflects a growing recognition that sustainability in transport must be approached through collaboration, innovation, and accountability.

The use of sustainable aviation fuel certificates is a meaningful step, but it is only one part of the larger journey towards decarbonisation. By combining fuel innovation with smarter logistics, alternative modes of transport, and more rigorous reporting, companies can begin to chart a path towards a truly sustainable aviation future.

As the aviation and retail industries navigate this transition, the lessons from such partnerships will be essential for shaping strategies that balance economic growth with environmental responsibility.

In 2024, Brazil launched its National Sustainable Aviation Fuel Program (ProBioQAV) to promote SAF adoption in its energy mix.
NCGA says this naturally favors Brazil’s double-cropping of soybeans and corn while devaluing the lifecycle profile of the U.S. single-crop corn system.
The U.S. State Department objected, claiming the recommendation would “unfairly penalize” American farmers to Brazil’s benefit in global markets.
The goal would be to “eliminate the unjust and scientifically unfounded burden that Brazil’s model imposes on the competitiveness of U.S. exports.”","The Section 301 investigation—under which the U.S. can impose trade sanctions on foreign partners—may conclude within six months to a year, aligning with Brazil’s 2026 election calendar. In Brasília, government officials are convinced that tensions with the U.S. will persist through next year and could escalate further.

Some American business groups are using the investigation to increase pressure on Brazil. The American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), for instance, urged the Trump administration to intervene in a deal in which Anglo American is selling its nickel operations in Brazil to Chinese miner MMG, arguing the transaction would give China even greater control over global reserves of critical minerals.

Meanwhile, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) is urging the USTR not only to demand compensation from Brazil for alleged losses in U.S. ethanol exports, but also to take aim at another perceived “threat”: Brazil’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) program.

Ethanol has become a fixation for Donald Trump when discussing trade with Brazil and holds major political importance for Republicans. When Mr. Trump issued his executive order to prepare retaliation tariffs at the start of his administration, Brazil was the first country mentioned, and ethanol was the first product.

U.S. corn producers broadly argue that Brazil’s rapid agricultural expansion in recent years has been “partly driven by protectionist advantages and decades of neglect regarding deforestation” in the Amazon and the Cerrado, enabling Brazil to seize market share from American farmers.

Corn ethanol projects in Brazil reach R$23bn in new investments

Now, “on top of all that,” they view Brazil as a “serious threat” to the long-term competitiveness of U.S. exports in the emerging SAF market, which is seen as key to the global aviation industry’s goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Brazil is viewed as a major potential supplier of the renewable fuel, which can be produced through various technologies.

In 2024, Brazil launched its National Sustainable Aviation Fuel Program (ProBioQAV) to promote SAF adoption in its energy mix. Airlines are required to increase SAF use by 1 percentage point annually until reaching 10% in 2036.

One U.S. complaint is that Brazil uses a carbon-neutral emissions model that assigns a premium to the lifecycle assessment of feedstocks from multiple crop cycles (main and second harvest) grown on formerly “degraded” pastureland. NCGA says this naturally favors Brazil’s double-cropping of soybeans and corn while devaluing the lifecycle profile of the U.S. single-crop corn system.

“Most concerning,” the group added, is that “unfortunately” Brazil has emerged as a central player in international standard-setting bodies for biofuels, such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

As an example, they noted that earlier this year, ICAO’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP) approved a recommendation on multi-cropping based on the Brazilian model. The U.S. State Department objected, claiming the recommendation would “unfairly penalize” American farmers to Brazil’s benefit in global markets.

U.S. producers fear that as international bodies and foreign markets—such as Japan and the European Union—begin to accept Brazil’s sustainability claims related to its multi-cropping systems, U.S. export competitiveness could be severely impacted. They warn of potential declines in the commercial value of American agricultural production and farmland, lost export revenue, reduced profits, and higher financing costs and risks for U.S. farmers and ethanol producers.

“That’s why the U.S. State Department raised objections with ICAO,” NCGA said. “The USTR should join the State Department’s efforts to address Brazil’s troubling influence in these international markets.”

The NCGA is proposing the creation of a U.S.-Brazil working group 90 days after the USTR’s investigation, aimed specifically at addressing emissions modeling in international forums. The goal would be to “eliminate the unjust and scientifically unfounded burden that Brazil’s model imposes on the competitiveness of U.S. exports.”",http://s.glbimg.com/en/ho/static/globocom2012/img/fb_marca.png,N,,2025-08-28 09:56:15.995617

Speaking in London, O’Leary said the industry is “dying a death” on sustainability and is unlikely to meet its 2030 SAF targets or the 2050 net zero goal.

The comments mark one of the bluntest rejections of mainstream climate policy by a major airline chief. While rivals like IAG, Lufthansa, and Delta tout biofuel investments, O’Leary doubled down on his view that SAF is a distraction. He argued that cost pressures and consumer demand will keep airlines focused on efficiency, not ideology.

Critics say such comments could undermine sector-wide efforts to decarbonize, especially as the EU prepares to mandate SAF blending. But O’Leary remains unmoved.

Despite advances in technology, the path to widespread SAF adoption remains constrained by cost, feedstock availability, and the pace of regulatory approvals.
Current SAF production represents less than 0.5% of global jet fuel demand, leaving a vast gap to bridge as airlines and governments push for more.","A technology developed by California-based Universal Fuel Technologies (Unifuel) that upgrades renewable feedstocks into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has advanced through the initial qualification process which will support the fuel’s entry to commercial aviation markets.

The company’s ethanol-to-jet technology, known as Flexiforming, has been accepted into the ASTM D4054 Clearinghouse, which supports the technical evaluation of new aviation fuels for qualification.

“The acceptance into the D4054 Clearinghouse is an important validation of our Flexiforming technology and significantly derisks our road to approval for commercial use,” said Alexei Beltyukov, CEO of Universal Fuel Technologies.

The process is designed to assess the potential for new fuels to safely power aircraft engines. It involves several tiers of testing, data collection, and technical review by experts from leading aerospace companies.

“We accept candidate fuels into the D4054 Clearinghouse that show strong potential for completing the ASTM qualification process successfully,” said Dr Zachary West, D4054 Clearinghouse Director.

Earlier this year, the company completed a five-month pilot project which produced nearly 100 litres of SAF using four different pathways including methanol and ethanol conversion before undergoing testing by Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab.

“The samples of Unifuel’s Flexiforming SAF candidates show promise to proceed to full certification as aviation turbine fuel,” said Harrison Yang, Research Assistant Processor of the BSEL at Washington State University.

With its technology accepted, the company will go ahead with producing larger fuel samples for Tier 1 and Tier 2 testing required for full ASTM qualification.

“The initial qualification could come as soon as the end of 2026 as a blend component with fossil jet,” explained Denis Pchelintsev, Co-Founder of Unifuel. “From there, further testing is planned, with the goal of leading to a 100% drop-in fully synthetic jet fuel in the future.”

According to Unifuel, its technology uses 75% less energy and 33% less hydrogen than other processes for ethanol-to-jet applications and could therefore cut costs by up to half.

The technology can also be used to upgrade low-value naphtha byproducts from HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch processes into aromatic SAF, a type of jet fuel that is blended with synthetic aromatic kerosene or contains bio-based aromatics. These aromatics are necessary to replicate the energy density and fuel system compatibility of conventional fossil jet fuel.

Despite advances in technology, the path to widespread SAF adoption remains constrained by cost, feedstock availability, and the pace of regulatory approvals. Current SAF production represents less than 0.5% of global jet fuel demand, leaving a vast gap to bridge as airlines and governments push for more.

To accelerate market uptake, policies such as the US SAF Grand Challenge, the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, and mandates in the UK and Japan are aiming to stimulate both production and demand through blending requirements, tax credits, and investment incentives.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2024/01/shutterstock_2325764425.jpg",N,,2025-08-28 07:56:26.538854

""In a high cost of living environment, Jetstar continued to provide value for customers, with around one in three travelling for under $100,"" Hudson said. This was enabled by new aircraft, strong demand which helped increase seat factor by 2 percentage points and lower fuel prices. New aircraft also provided customer benefits including inflight streaming and more onboard baggage space. Jetstar launched 11 new international routes supported by the delivery of the new A321LR and A320neo aircraft.

Qantas Domestic unit revenue increased by 5%, with charter revenue up 9% due to additional Airbus A319 aircraft servicing the resources market in Western Australia. Overall, Group Domestic delivered $1.52 billion in Underlying EBIT, up 12 per cent from the prior year, at a margin of 14 per cent.

Hudson said new aircraft investment would further improve operational performance and customer satisfaction. Qantas Link has also received five new A220s, expected to deliver up to $9 million additional annual EBITDA benefit per aircraft over the 717 aircraft they replaced.

The first two A321XLRs are expected to enter service on Qantas' domestic network in mid-September, making it the first airline in the Asia Pacific to operate this aircraft type.

Qantas ended the year with $12.2 billion of liquidity, including $2.2 billion in cash and $1.4 billion in committed undrawn facilities. Net debt increased to $5.0 billion, remaining below the middle of the Group's target range.

""Looking ahead, there is a lot to be excited about,"" said Hudson. The first A350-1000ULR for Project Sunrise is progressing, with delivery expected in October 2026 and the first non-stop ultra-long-haul commercial flight planned for the first half of 2027.

""This year will see an acceleration of Qantas’ domestic fleet renewal and in the coming years we’ll take delivery of additional A321XLR aircraft fitted with lie-flat Business seats.

Middle East gasoline market braces for tight supply

Middle East gasoline market braces for tight supply

Singapore, 28 August (Argus) — A heavy refinery turnaround season in the Mideast Gulf is expected to exacerbate an already tight gasoline market in the fourth quarter, prompting key regional suppliers to boost imports. Saudi Arabia, which has already shut down two of its refineries, is preparing to take additional facilities off line in the coming months. Aramco's 460,000 b/d Satorp refinery in Jubail is due for a 60-day shutdown in November-December, while maintenance is also planned at the Riyadh refinery in the fourth quarter, though details have not been officially confirmed. The upcoming turnaround plans come on the back of earlier maintenances at Aramco's facilities, including the 400,000 b/d Jizan refinery, where the reformer unit was taken off line since July, although the unit is expected to come back on line this month. Around four to five MR-sized gasoline cargoes from Jizan heads to Asia Pacific because of restrictions around specifications, traders said. The heavy turnaround season in the Mideast Gulf also coincides with a period of increased off line refinery capacity in Asia-Pacific, which has tightened the regional supply balances . Adding to the supply strain, Aramco's 400,000 b/d Yasref refinery in Yanbu — a joint-venture with Sinopec — is currently operating its reformer at reduced rates. Kuwait's state-owned Kuwait National Petroleum Company (KNPC) also plans to shut several units at its 490,000 b/d Mina Abdullah (MAB) refinery for a 30-day maintenance period starting 1 October. Additional pressure may come from India, where the end of the monsoon season is expected to boost domestic demand, further reducing export volumes. The Argus MEBOB crack spread, which reflects 92R oxygenated cargoes trading from the Mideast Gulf, has mirrored the bullish sentiment, increasing to $11.84/bl on 27 August from $11.72/bl on 26 August. Premiums for gasoline cargoes offered by Mideast Gulf refineries have strengthened, with Pakistan's state-owned refiner PSO — a major gasoline importer in south Asia — receiving offers at premiums of $7–12/bl to the Mideast Gulf 92R spot assessment for cargoes loading for July-September. This compares to offers in the $5–6/bl range earlier in the year. The Argus assessed 92R Mideast Gulf gasoline premiums have averaged $5.91/bl and $5.71/bl in July and June, respectively. This is up from a monthly average of $4.17/bl in May and $3.50/bl in April. The latest EU sanctions on India's Nayara energy, a regular supplier to Aramco, has temporarily disrupted the company's access to at least one cargo per month. Nayara Energy has resumed gasoline exports, but the recent cargoes are heading to Oman's Sohar, traders said. The firm has also cut run rates at its 400,000 b/d Vadinar refinery after it became increasingly difficult to send products to both domestic and export markets. Turning to alternative sources With regional output lagging, the Mideast Gulf is increasingly turning to Europe and Asia to fill the gap. Imports of gasoline from northwest Europe to Mideast Gulf surged to a seven-month high in July, according to ship-tracking data from Vortexa. A total of 291,000t of gasoline — roughly 78,000 b/d — arrived in Saudi Arabia from European ports, the highest volume since December 2024. The Mideast Gulf's overall gasoline imports also jumped to 1.03mn t in July, up by 35pc from June, marking the highest monthly volume since January. Imports remain elevated in August, indicating continued shortfalls in domestic output. Saudi Arabia has sharply increased its gasoline imports, bringing in 478,000t of the motor fuel in July compared to just 144,000t in June. The UAE has also stepped up its buying, importing 864,000t in August so far, already surpassing the 648,000t received in July. Meanwhile, operational issues at Nigeria's 650,000 b/d Dangote refinery are likely to persist until early September. The refinery had previously supplied two LR cargoes to the Mideast Gulf region when the markets were tight in June-July. If economics align and its residual fluid catalytic cracker (RFCC) issues are resolved, flows from Dangote could emerge — but that remains uncertain for now.

Bringing an automated AI workforce to the parcel delivery Synkka was founded this year by Torbjörn Maaherra (CEO), Jordon Cornish (Chief Growth Officer) and Danylo Topchii (CTO).
The motivation was a direct response to a growth-killing rule that has governed the parcel delivery industry for decades: to scale your operation, you must scale your headcount.
Cornish shares with TFN, “Our founder, Torbjorn Maaherra, witnessed this firsthand for over ten years while building a parcel delivery technology.
Cornish concludes: “The roadmap includes deploying a full suite of AI teams to manage the most challenging roles in parcel delivery, from technical support and client implementation to financial reconciliation.","Scaling parcel networks has long followed a simple rule: if volumes go up, so does headcount. Each new market entry, carrier integration, or seasonal surge typically means hiring more engineers, analysts, and operations staff. UK-based startup Synkka believes the playbook is broken and aims to replace human-intensive functions with autonomous AI workers.

The company has just closed an oversubscribed pre-seed round led by Ascension VC, joined by a syndicate of parcel delivery experts, including former founders and executives from ITA Group, ZigZag, Sendify and ex-Global-E.

Synkka declined to share valuation or round size with TFN, saying only that the priority was securing investors with direct industry experience rather than setting early financial benchmarks.

Bringing an automated AI workforce to the parcel delivery

Synkka was founded this year by Torbjörn Maaherra (CEO), Jordon Cornish (Chief Growth Officer) and Danylo Topchii (CTO). Maaherra spent more than a decade in parcel technology at companies including Einride, Centiro, and Australia Post Global, where he says he witnessed the inefficiencies of human-heavy processes firsthand. Cornish brings experience scaling venture-backed SaaS startups such as Affinity and Showpad, while Topchii has led AI development at LooqMe and Shares, with a focus on agentic AI systems.

The motivation was a direct response to a growth-killing rule that has governed the parcel delivery industry for decades: to scale your operation, you must scale your headcount.

Cornish shares with TFN, “Our founder, Torbjorn Maaherra, witnessed this firsthand for over ten years while building a parcel delivery technology. He recognised that this model of manual labour has become a permanent tax on growth for any ambitious company. They employ unnecessary headcount, which can now be automated. Synkka was founded not just to fix this, but to end it entirely by building the automated workforce for the future of Parcel Delivery.”

An AI-powered digital team

Synkka’s first product, the AI Carrier Integration Team, is pitched as a fully digital replacement for one of the costliest functions in parcel operations: connecting companies technically to delivery partners. What typically takes months of technical setup can, according to the company, be reduced to days, with costs cut by up to 60%.

Unlike workflow automation software that streamlines tasks but still expects human oversight, Synkka positions its agents as complete replacements for specific roles. That means the real competitor, in its view, isn’t other startups but the internal integration, QA and support teams that companies currently maintain.

The integration product is only the first step. Synkka’s roadmap includes launching AI teams to handle customer support, financial reconciliation, client onboarding and even claims management.

Cornish concludes: “The roadmap includes deploying a full suite of AI teams to manage the most challenging roles in parcel delivery, from technical support and client implementation to financial reconciliation. The ultimate objective over the next five years is to provide the intelligent, automated workforces required to run an entire delivery operation automatically.”",https://techfundingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Synkka-platform-1.png,N,,2025-08-28 07:56:47.195720

The clean manufacturing sector saw a 15% and 19% decrease compared to the first quarter of 2025 and the second quarter of 2024, respectively.
Battery manufacturing specifically is down 22% compared to the same period last year, and solar manufacturing is down 25%.

The second quarter of 2025 saw a total of $68 billion in investments, according to a new report released today by the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project of the Rhodium Group and MIT’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research. The number represents a 1% increase compared to the same period last year — but it is the third consecutive quarterly decline recorded since President Trump was elected in November 2024.

Investment in manufacturing, in particular, is in decline. The clean manufacturing sector saw a 15% and 19% decrease compared to the first quarter of 2025 and the second quarter of 2024, respectively. Battery manufacturing specifically is down 22% compared to the same period last year, and solar manufacturing is down 25%.

Between April and June, companies canceled the equivalent of $5 billion in manufacturing projects; that’s in addition to the record $7 billion in cancellations that occurred during the first quarter of the year, mostly in electric vehicles and battery manufacturing. Another $5 billion projects were cancelled in the clean electricity and decarbonization sectors.

These findings mirror those of other recent reports, including an analysis by research group E2, which found that at least 35 clean energy projects have been closed, cancelled, or downsized since Trump took office, more than the totals for 2023 and 2024 combined.

And at least in manufacturing, these cancellations are not being offset by new projects. Companies announced only $4 billion in new projects in the second quarter of 2025, marking the first quarter when the value of cancellations exceeded new announcements.

Generally, the report also found a decrease in new project announcements across all sectors. Compared to last year, the average number of new announced projects per quarter was down 44% for manufacturing, 38% for industrial decarbonization, and 28% for utility electricity.

$517 billion on the line

The report provides a snapshot of how the clean energy sector is faring after months of policy uncertainty that culminated in the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill into law in early July. The slowdown in growth, however, is likely to persist, given that the new legislation slashed clean energy subsidies, shortened tax incentives eligibility timelines for qualifying projects, and introduced new “foreign entity of concern” rules restricting sourcing.

These measures are bound to impact $517 billion in outstanding investments in clean energy and transportation projects that are not yet online, according to the report.

Of those, $112 billion are manufacturing investments, heavily concentrated in the EV supply chain, including batteries and critical minerals projects. These will probably suffer from the addition of FEOC rules, as well as from the loss of federal tax credits for the purchase of new and used EVs. Meanwhile, $171 billion are outstanding solar and wind investments, which are now obliged to either start construction by July 2026 or else come online before 2027 to still be eligible for credits.

Technologies like sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen have received more favorable treatment from the current administration. Still, outstanding projects in those categories are also likely to be impacted by the changes in policy, with $56 billion in SAF projects having to source feedstock from within North America starting in 2026 to qualify for credits, and $47 billion in hydrogen projects having to start construction by the end of 2027.",https://i0.wp.com/www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-08-27T172428.236.jpg?fit=1920%2C1280&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-28 00:56:13.359404
