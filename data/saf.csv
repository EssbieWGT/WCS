Greg Jackson — founder of the energy technology company — says families are being “played” by a system riddled with waste.

That includes £100million spent on a bat tunnel for the HS2 rail route and £700million on “fish disco” protection measures at Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset.

In a rallying cry for common sense in 2026, the tycoon insists the path to lower inflation and cheaper power rests in stripping away over-regulation and bureaucracy.

He warned: “We desperately need energy bills to fall.

“This will only happen if the Government gets tough on big companies gaming the system.

“It means ending bonkers stuff like paying wind farms over £1billion to turn off on windy days.”

But, despite that waste, he insists the world is moving away from oil and gas towards green energy technology.

The Octopus Energy chief explained: “Firstly, they’re becoming more affordable. Just three years ago, gas prices sent bills sky high and trashed our economy.

“As long as we’re hooked on them, we’re at the mercy of dictators and foreign governments.

“More from the North Sea may help — but it’s a drop in the ocean and won’t save us from these forces.

“Secondly, electric technologies just keep getting better. The cost of solar, batteries and electric cars is plummeting. When you buy gas from Qatar it’s gone the moment you burn it. Solar panels generate power for decades.”

Mr Jackson also called for a return to old-fashioned customer service in this age of AI.

He urged firms to start answering the phone instead of hiding behind “crappy systems and computers that say no”.

That — and slashing costs added to bills to fund infrastructure “we don’t need” — is the only way to get the economy moving again.

If ministers cut the rot he predicts a brighter future where green tech delivers energy independence, economic growth and lower family bills.

A future of fakeaways

SHOPPERS are mixing budget basics with posh treats to beat the cost-of-living crunch.

Sainsbury’s CEO Simon Roberts reckons 2026 will be the year of the “fakeaway” — as families ditch pricy restaurants for premium meals at home.

He said: “Dining out has become more expensive so our premium ranges are really popular. More customers will choose restaurant quality food at home.”

He said the big weekly shop is back in fashion as people flock back to work.

And he vowed to back British farmers and use hi-tech loyalty apps to give ­customers the “tailored experiences” they will crave this year.

Bank on Cups

PUB landlords are banking on a World Cup bonanza to save them from a Budget tax nightmare.

Star Pubs’ boss Lawson Mountstevens said: “If you can’t be at the game, nothing beats watching it at your local with a delicious pint.”

Meanwhile Stella David, boss of Ladbrokes owner Entain, said the “extremely high tax increases” could threaten high-street bookies and drive punters to use black-market operators.

They don’t sell celluloid — they sell star power. If you have an established icon like Clara Bow, you sell It: allure, magnetism, and the special sparkle that turns a performer into a phenomenon. If you have a rising force like Ann Sheridan, you sell Oomph: that impossible-to-bottle mystique and sex appeal that storms the box office before the critics even learn her name.

It and Oomph. That’s the formula.

For renewable fuels, that moment arrives in 2026. The gallons of green liquid? Not the star anymore. The real value lies in the attributes — the verified, tradeable, financeable proof of carbon benefit.

Like:

• Energy Attribute Certificates (RECs, Guarantees of Origin)

• Zero-Emission Credits (rewarding firm, carbon-free generation)

• Low-Carbon Fuel Synthesis Attributes (SAFc and friends)

And when you look at eSAF, the ultimate Oomph emerges: small modular nuclear reactors paired with hydrogen and fuel synthesis — precision-engineered to electrify Wall Street. And this isn’t theory — the deals are already in the news.

The It Girl: Aemetis Biogas

If “It” is that intangible quality that takes something merely promising and makes it irresistible, Aemetis has it in spades.

Their subsidiary Aemetis Biogas LLC has just received funds from the sale of $17 million of federal clean energy tax credits — including Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credits and Section 48 Investment Tax Credits. This wasn’t a paper shuffle — it delivered $15 million in net cash into the business, after transaction costs. Breakdown:

~$12M from Section 48 ITC tied to constructing a dairy digester that’s already producing biogas

~$5M from Section 45Z PTC tied to renewable natural gas production during 2025

And that’s just the first act. Aemetis expects:

Significantly higher 45Z credit values as volumes scale and guidance strengthens

An additional $10.5 million Section 45C credit in 2026 (already IRS + DOE approved)

That is It Factor economics: proven molecules + proven metadata = proven money. This isn’t Hollywood hype. It’s recurring cash flow with receipts.

The Oomph Girl: XCF Global

If oomph is the quality that makes investors reach for their checkbook before the set is even built — XCF Global has it. They’ve announced a sweeping non-binding MOU with IP3, Southern Energy Renewables, and DevvStream to explore an integrated model for:

SMR nuclear power

Electro-sustainable aviation fuel

Tokenized, verifiable environmental attributes

This is how high-value compliance markets get fed — continuously, reliably, and at industrial scale. The collaboration envisions:

SMR-generated electricity powering both electrolysis + fuel synthesis

Excess zero-carbon power supporting booming AI/data-center customers

Digital MRV + provenance tracking ensuring every claim checks out

“Book-and-claim” SAF structures enabling climate benefits to fly globally even before fuel does

This isn’t yesterday’s offset story. This is data-driven decarbonization that Wall Street can underwrite. And they’re doing it with a narrative investors already adore: nuclear = energy security + industry revival + jobs + big-ticket growth. Nothing has more Oomph right now.

They Said It

“This tax credit sale represents an important step in monetizing federal clean fuel transferable tax incentives and establishing a new recurring source of cash flow,” said Eric McAfee, Chairman and CEO of Aemetis. “This is our first sale of a Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit from dairy RNG, and we expect additional Section 45Z transactions in 2026 and future years from ongoing renewable natural gas production, along with additional Section 48 transactions from ongoing digester construction. With the completion of $95 million of ITC transactions and today’s first Section 45Z sale, we are executing our tax credit monetization strategy. We expect federal 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credits to be a rapidly growing source of operating cash flow to support the expansion of production and new job creation.”

Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, commented: “This MOU reflects XCF’s disciplined approach to evaluating infrastructure and partnerships that can strengthen the scalability, reliability, and carbon performance of next-generation sustainable aviation fuels. Firm, zero-carbon power is an important enabler for eSAF pathways, and this collaboration allows us to assess how integrated power, fuel, and environmental-attribute frameworks could support broader adoption of clean fuels.”

RDML (Ret.) Mike Hewitt, Chief Executive Officer of IP3, added: “Clean, reliable nuclear power is increasingly being pursued as foundational infrastructure for American energy security and industrial growth. We are excited to explore a strategic relationship with XCF, DevvStream, and Southern, including the potential deployment of small modular reactor technology to provide firm power and support e‑SAF production for European markets. IP3’s business model to develop infrastructure projects to privatize Small Modular Reactors for multiple offtakers such as AI and data centers that support government and commercial requirements. We believe pairing firm power development with practical environmental‑asset design and monetization can create a differentiated platform that meets real customer demand while delivering the transparency the market expects.”

Sunny Trinh, Chief Executive Officer of DevvStream, commented:“Together, we are exploring real-world asset and tokenized environmental-asset frameworks with the potential to unlock additional value, improve liquidity, and help lower the delivered cost of clean energy and fuels. We see this as a potential America-first model that combines U.S. resources, digital infrastructure, and scalable markets.”

Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern Energy, added: “This MOU reflects our focus on putting American energy, infrastructure, and production first. As the development of advanced nuclear platforms gains momentum, we believe the goal of developing and deploying firm, domestic power is becoming essential for fuels, manufacturing, and data-driven industries. We are committed to exploring how nuclear power, combined with U.S. biomass resources, can enable an integrated, multi-product approach that strengthens U.S. industrial leadership while remaining globally competitive.”

Oomph Wins the Audition. Persistence Wins the Franchise.

Look — right now, the financial markets care less about feasible and more about financeable. Investors want:

bankable revenue streams

compliance premiums

physical + digital verification

infrastructure that already exists or can be reused

Which is why Aemetis’ bolt-on model might be the most powerful story of all: Oomph gets you noticed. Persistence gets you greenlit.

Nuclear may be the red-hot starlet of the energy world — stealing headlines and dazzling regulators — but the projects that endure are the ones already delivering today.

Fiji Airways has issued a travel alert for two of its routes in the region, warning customers of the possibility of disruption owing to fuel shortages at the airports of destinations in these islands. The air operator, however, has confirmed the operation of flights on the routes Funafuti and Nadi-Vava’u, but there will be constraints owing to fuel shortages at the airports involved.

The flights to Funafuti will operate under restrictions until January 15, 2026, according to the airline, as the plane will have to take more contingency fuel from Fiji. The impact of the additional weight of the fuel will result in the plane carrying reduced capacity, and the flights will not operate at their normal capacity. This will result in the possibility of carrying out passenger and cargo offloads to enhance the weight and balance of the plane. The same will be the scenario for the flights operating on the Nadi-Vava’u route, as there will be a scarcity of fuel until January 9, 2026.

Impact on Passengers and Luggage

Fiji Airways has advised that due to weight limitations, both passengers and their checked baggage may be offloaded from flights where necessary. Affected passengers and luggage will be accommodated on the next available service, subject to operational availability.

To manage the situation, passengers are being urged to carry essential items and overnight necessities in their hand luggage, ensuring that it falls within standard carry-on rules. This recommendation is designed to minimize inconvenience and ensure passengers have what they need during their travels.

Airline’s Efforts to Address the Fuel Shortage

Fiji Airways has emphasized that the fuel shortage is temporary, with fuel supplies expected to be restored by mid-January for Funafuti and by January 9, 2026 for Nadi–Vava’u. While these disruptions are inconvenient, the airline is working to ensure that passengers can continue their journeys with minimal delays.

Future Travel Impacts: Long-Term Effects on Regional Operations

While the current disruptions will be short-term, Fiji Airways’s ongoing adjustments to its fuel strategy and capacity planning are likely to have longer-term impacts on the airline’s regional operations. The airline’s reliance on contingency fuel from Fiji and the limited weight capacity of aircraft can affect flight schedules, especially on high-demand routes like Funafuti and Nadi–Vava’u. As the airline prepares for an increase in international travel demand, particularly for leisure tourism in the Pacific region, these fuel-related disruptions may prompt future improvements to regional flight scheduling and fuel distribution strategies to ensure consistent service delivery.

Fiji Airways’ efforts to return to normal flight operations after fuel supplies are restored will likely provide valuable insights into regional aviation dynamics and how to better manage fuel-related challenges in the future. As international tourism rebounds across the Pacific, maintaining efficient, sustainable flight operations will be critical for the airline to meet growing demand, especially from international travelers seeking tropical destinations.

Future Focus: Improving Sustainability and Regional Connectivity

Looking toward the future, Fiji Airways is likely to focus on further optimizing fuel management and enhancing regional connectivity. This may include exploring sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) options and innovative fuel solutions that could prevent similar issues in the long term. With a growing number of tourists heading to Pacific island nations, it will be essential for Fiji Airways to ensure reliable service while reducing its environmental impact.

Additionally, expanding partnerships with local airports and governments to streamline fuel supply chains and increase airlift capacity in remote destinations like Funafuti and Nadi–Vava’u will be key to minimizing operational challenges in the coming years. This will also support tourism growth by making travel to these regions more accessible and efficient.

Managing Short-Term Disruptions for Long-Term Growth

The recent fuel shortages and associated flight restrictions within the Funafuti and Nadi – Vava’u routes are only temporary; however, they underscore the value of long-term planning in terms of fuel management and Pacific connectivity strategies for Fiji Airways. This aviation company will continue to develop approaches in order to optimize future performance in light of increasing demand in the Pacific tourism industry.

Emirates strengthened its standing in 2025 as the world's largest international airline, carrying 55.6 million passengers across almost 180,580 flights and reinforcing Dubai's role as a central hub for long-haul air travel. The carrier said the scale of its operations during the year equated to circling the Earth more than 29,000 times, underlining the breadth of its global network at a time when international aviation demand continued to normalise after years of disruption.

The airline also placed orders for 73 new aircraft, signalling confidence in sustained long-term growth and in the resilience of global travel demand. Fleet expansion remains a central pillar of Emirates' strategy, aimed at maintaining capacity on high-traffic routes while opening or strengthening links to emerging markets across Asia, Africa and the Americas. Industry analysts view the order book as one of the most closely watched indicators of the carrier's outlook, given its dependence on wide-body aircraft and ultra-long-haul connectivity.

The airline's expanding global footprint in 2025 was framed by a milestone anniversary, with Emirates marking four decades since the launch of its operations in October. In a statement issued on Wednesday, the airline said the year reflected a“clear vision for shaping the future of travel through sustained excellence”, pointing to operational consistency, service standards and network breadth as defining features of its performance.

Passenger numbers remained below pre-pandemic peaks on certain routes due to aircraft delivery delays affecting the wider aviation sector, yet load factors were described by industry data providers as robust across most regions. Demand on Europe-Asia and Middle East-Americas corridors continued to anchor traffic flows, while routes to South Asia and parts of Africa saw steady growth, driven by both leisure and labour mobility.

Operationally, Emirates' near-180,000 flights highlighted the scale at which the airline manages complex scheduling and logistics. Aviation specialists note that maintaining punctuality and service quality across such volumes requires heavy investment in crew training, digital systems and ground operations. Emirates has increasingly leaned on data-driven planning to optimise turnaround times at Dubai International Airport, one of the world's busiest for international passengers.

The aircraft order announced during the year included a mix of next-generation wide-body jets intended to replace older models and support future expansion. These aircraft are expected to deliver improved fuel efficiency and lower emissions per seat, a key consideration as regulators and investors place greater scrutiny on aviation's environmental footprint. While long-haul flying remains carbon-intensive, Emirates has signalled incremental steps towards sustainability, including operational efficiencies and participation in sustainable aviation fuel initiatives, though large-scale adoption remains constrained by supply and cost.

Competition among global network carriers intensified during 2025, with rivals in Europe, North America and Asia restoring capacity and adding frequencies on overlapping routes. Despite this, Emirates retained its edge in international passenger volumes, largely due to its hub-and-spoke model centred on Dubai, which allows the airline to aggregate demand from multiple regions and deploy high-capacity aircraft efficiently. Analysts say this structure continues to give Emirates flexibility that point-to-point operators struggle to replicate on intercontinental routes.

The airline's performance also had broader implications for Dubai's economy. Aviation remains a cornerstone of the emirate's tourism, trade and services sectors, supporting thousands of jobs directly and indirectly. Passenger throughput through Dubai International Airport feeds into hospitality, retail and logistics, reinforcing the city's positioning as a global crossroads. Government data have consistently linked airline capacity growth with higher visitor numbers and stronger non-oil economic activity.

Conclusion With the Mi-34M1 entering flight tests, Russia is reasserting itself in the light helicopter segment.","At a time when sanctions and supply chain restrictions are reshaping the global aerospace industry, Russia is pushing forward with a clear message: domestic aviation is not slowing down.

Rostec’s “Russian Helicopters” holding has officially begun flight tests of the Mi-34M1, a modern light single-engine multipurpose helicopter designed entirely around Russian-made technologies. The maiden flight marks an important milestone in restoring a segment long dominated by foreign light helicopters.

Mi-34M1 Enters Flight Testing Phase

The Mi-34M1 completed its first test flight lasting around ten minutes, during which engineers evaluated the helicopter’s stability, controllability, and structural loads. The aircraft performed standard horizontal flight maneuvers and turns, allowing specialists to assess how key systems behave under real aerodynamic stress.

According to Rostec, the helicopter demonstrated predictable handling and strong maneuverability—two qualities essential for training, monitoring, and civilian operations. The test campaign confirms that the Mi-34M1 is progressing steadily toward certification.

Powered by the New VK-650V Engine

At the heart of the Mi-34M1 is the VK-650V turboshaft engine, developed by the United Engine Corporation under Rostec. This engine represents a major achievement, as it is the first Russian-designed powerplant for light helicopters in the up-to-four-ton takeoff weight category.

Delivering 650 horsepower at takeoff, the VK-650V is built around a modular architecture that simplifies maintenance and extends service life. It is also equipped with a digital full-authority engine control (FADEC) system, improving fuel efficiency, reliability, and pilot workload management—especially important for training and private aviation.

Key Specifications (Preliminary)

While certification testing is still underway, the Mi-34M1 is expected to feature the following performance characteristics:

Engine: VK-650V turboshaft (650 hp)

Maximum speed: ~240 km/h

Cruise speed: ~210 km/h

Operational range: ~500 km

Payload capacity: ~600 kg (internal and external combined)

Crew: 1–2 pilots

Passenger capacity: Up to 3–4 passengers

Takeoff weight class: Up to 4 tons

These parameters place the Mi-34M1 firmly in the same operational category as popular Western light helicopters, while offering lower dependency on foreign components.

Designed for Versatility and Ease of Operation

Rostec CEO Sergey Chemezov emphasized that the Mi-34M1 was developed with simplicity and versatility in mind. The helicopter is highly maneuverable, easy to fly, and economical to maintain—qualities that make it suitable for a wide range of missions.

Primary roles include:

Passenger and private transport

Aerial monitoring and patrol missions

Flight training and pilot instruction

Aviation sports and aerobatic flying

Its straightforward maintenance philosophy also makes it attractive for regional operators, flying clubs, and private owners.

Replacing Foreign Light Helicopters

One of the Mi-34M1’s most strategic roles is filling a market niche previously dominated by foreign light helicopters. Due to rising operating costs, spare parts shortages, and unofficial maintenance practices, many imported helicopters have become expensive and difficult to support.

The Mi-34M1 offers a domestically supported alternative, with local manufacturing, certified maintenance chains, and predictable operating costs—an increasingly important factor for Russian civil aviation.Mi-34M1 proves that modern, competitive aircraft can be developed using entirely domestic technologies, from engines to onboard avionics.

Conclusion

With the Mi-34M1 entering flight tests, Russia is reasserting itself in the light helicopter segment. Combining modern onboard systems, the new VK-650V engine, and a focus on ease of operation, the helicopter is positioned as a practical, homegrown solution for civilian aviation, training, and private use.

As testing continues, the Mi-34M1 could soon become a familiar sight in Russian skies—quietly replacing foreign machines with a domestically built alternative.",https://i0.wp.com/jetlinemarvel.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-01-114126.png?resize=554%2C305&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-01 18:12:15.922361

Final Assessment for the 2026 Investor As we move into 2026, Delta Air Lines stands as a testament to the power of disciplined financial management and brand positioning.","As the global financial markets ring in 2026, a stark divergence has emerged between the high-flying valuations of the broader indices and the grounded, cash-generating reality of the industrial sector. With the S&P 500 trading at a historically steep forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23x, driven by a multi-year surge in technology and artificial intelligence, investors are increasingly scouring the market for ""quality value""—companies with fortress balance sheets, dominant market positions, and valuations that have yet to catch up to their fundamental earnings power.

Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) has emerged at the forefront of this search. While the broader market appears priced for perfection, Delta enters 2026 trading at a modest 9.5x forward earnings, despite coming off a fiscal 2025 that saw record-breaking revenue and a massive reduction in long-term debt. This valuation gap represents one of the most significant opportunities in the large-cap space, positioning the Atlanta-based carrier as a top pick for value-oriented portfolios in the coming year.

The Crusade Against Debt and the Premium Pivot

The story of Delta’s ascent to a top value pick for 2026 began in earnest during its ""crusade against debt"" throughout 2024 and 2025. Following the turbulence of the early 2020s, Delta’s management team, led by CEO Ed Bastian, executed a disciplined capital allocation strategy that prioritized balance sheet repair over aggressive capacity expansion. By the end of 2025, Delta successfully slashed its adjusted net debt from over $21 billion to approximately $15.3 billion, reclaiming its investment-grade status across all major credit agencies. This deleveraging has not only lowered interest expenses but has also cleared the runway for increased shareholder returns in 2026.

Central to this financial transformation has been Delta’s strategic pivot toward ""premiumization."" Throughout 2025, the airline saw a structural shift in consumer behavior, where high-income travelers increasingly opted for premium cabins, including Delta One and Premium Select. This shift was underscored by the record-breaking performance of Delta’s partnership with American Express (NYSE: AXP), which generated over $7 billion in high-margin remuneration in 2025 alone. By focusing on the high-end consumer, Delta has successfully insulated itself from the price wars that have traditionally plagued the lower-cost segments of the industry.

Winners and Losers in the New Aviation Landscape

In the competitive landscape of early 2026, Delta’s ""premium-first"" strategy has created a widening moat between it and its peers. United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ: UAL) has remained a formidable competitor, also benefiting from international expansion and premium demand, but it continues to carry a heavier debt load than Delta. Meanwhile, American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL) has struggled to achieve the same level of margin expansion, as it grapples with higher operational complexities and a slower path to deleveraging.

The real losers in this environment have been the traditional low-cost carriers. Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV), long the darling of the budget sector, spent much of 2025 undergoing a radical transformation—including the introduction of assigned seating and premium cabin options—in a desperate bid to capture the high-yield travelers that Delta has already secured. As fuel prices and labor costs remained elevated through 2025, the thin margins of the ""no-frills"" model became increasingly unsustainable, forcing a consolidation of the market that has ultimately benefited Delta’s pricing power.

Resilience Amidst Industry Constraints

The wider significance of Delta’s current position lies in its ability to thrive despite persistent industry-wide supply constraints. As of January 1, 2026, the aviation industry continues to be hamstrung by aircraft delivery delays from both Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Airbus (OTC:EADSY). While these delays have limited the industry’s ability to add new seats, they have inadvertently acted as a floor for ticket prices. Delta’s older but well-maintained fleet and its superior operational reliability have allowed it to maintain record load factors—projected at 84% for 2026—while competitors struggle with grounded planes and maintenance backlogs.

Furthermore, a significant tailwind for the airline sector in 2026 is the cooling of global energy prices. Brent crude is forecast to average $58 per barrel this year, down from $66 in 2025. For an airline of Delta’s scale, this reduction in its largest variable cost represents a massive boost to the bottom line. When combined with the ""premiumization"" trend, Delta is entering 2026 with a rare combination of falling costs and rising yields, a scenario that historically precedes significant stock price appreciation.

The Road Ahead: Buybacks and Dividends

Looking toward the remainder of 2026, the market is anticipating a strategic pivot in Delta’s capital allocation. With the debt-to-EBITDAR ratio now sitting comfortably at 2.0x, analysts expect the company to transition from debt repayment to aggressive shareholder returns. Short-term possibilities include a significant hike in the quarterly dividend and the potential announcement of a multi-billion dollar share buyback program, which would be the first major repurchase since the pre-pandemic era.

However, challenges remain. The industry must still navigate a complex regulatory environment and the ongoing pressure to invest in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Delta’s ability to integrate these environmental costs without eroding its 11.5% operating margin will be a key metric for investors to watch. Additionally, while the ""K-shaped"" economy has favored Delta’s premium focus, any broader slowdown in high-end consumer spending could test the resilience of its 2026 earnings guidance.

Final Assessment for the 2026 Investor

As we move into 2026, Delta Air Lines stands as a testament to the power of disciplined financial management and brand positioning. In a market where many stocks are trading at valuations that assume decades of uninterrupted growth, Delta offers a ""margin of safety"" that is increasingly rare. With a consensus analyst price target of $82—representing a nearly 20% upside from current levels—the stock is priced as a cyclical airline but is performing like a high-quality industrial powerhouse.

For investors, the key takeaways are clear: Delta has fixed its balance sheet, captured the most profitable segment of the travel market, and is now poised to benefit from lower fuel costs and restricted supply. While the tech sector may continue to capture headlines, the real value in 2026 is likely to be found in the blue skies of the aviation sector. Investors should keep a close eye on quarterly earnings reports for confirmation of the promised buybacks, which could serve as the final catalyst to close the valuation gap between Delta and the broader market.

“The Biofuels Production Incentive was announced by Prime Minister Carney on September 5, 2025, and today marks the shift from policy intent to delivery.

“Canadian producers have been operating at a competitive disadvantage since the introduction of the United States’ Inflation Reduction Act and the Clean Fuel Production Credit, which significantly lowered U.S. production costs and reshaped North American capital flows.

“The Biofuels Production Incentive supports Canadian jobs, Canadian feedstocks, and Canadian fuel supply, helping keep clean fuel investment and production anchored in Canada amid ongoing trade and policy uncertainty. Biofuels are an immediately deployable solution that reduces emissions while supporting rural economies, well-paying jobs, domestic feedstocks like canola, and greater energy security.

“Advanced Biofuels Canada Association represents producers of biodiesel, ethanol, renewable diesel, renewable gasoline, and sustainable aviation fuel, which are blended into the transportation fuels Canadians rely on every day.

“While the Biofuels Production Incentive is a positive short-term measure for 2026 and 2027, it does not fully close the gap with U.S. production subsidies. Long-term competitiveness will require complementary, structural measures that provide certainty for investment in Canadian renewable fuel production and feedstock supply chains.

“The federal–provincial–territorial table on low-carbon fuels is already established, and it is the next critical step to align long-term policies that keep Canadian biofuel production stable, thriving, and anchored in Canada, rather than leaving Canada’s supply and competitiveness exposed to foreign policy decisions.

“Provinces have a central role to play in ensuring Canada remains attractive for capital investments in biofuel production, feedstock processing, and renewable fuel infrastructure, while ensuring that farmers and rural communities capture the long-term jobs, revenues, and value-added benefits these supply chains generate.

“Advanced Biofuels Canada Association encourages provinces and territories to engage actively at the federal-provincial-territorial table to deliver durable, long-term investment-ready solutions. Coordinated policy action will protect existing facilities, attract new capital, and keep biofuel investment and production in Canada.

“Today’s implementation is important groundwork, and the focus now must be on durable policy frameworks that allow the sector to grow.”

This ""Production Paradox"" is reshaping the global economy, as major producers choose to defend market share and leverage low-cost efficiencies rather than curb supply to support prices.
Throughout 2025, the World Bank and IMF recorded a 7% annual decline in commodity prices, a trend that is forecasted to repeat in 2026.
Winners and Losers in the Low-Cost Era In this environment, the clear winners are the ""low-cost leaders"" who can remain profitable even at depressed price levels.
Summary and Investor Takeaways The global commodity market of 2026 is defined by a fierce battle for dominance in a low-margin world.","As the world rings in 2026, the global commodity markets are locked in a baffling contradiction. Despite a four-year downward trend that has pushed the broad commodity index to six-year lows, production levels for everything from crude oil to battery metals are reaching historic highs. This ""Production Paradox"" is reshaping the global economy, as major producers choose to defend market share and leverage low-cost efficiencies rather than curb supply to support prices.

The immediate implications are a boon for consumers and manufacturers, who are enjoying the lowest input costs since the pre-pandemic era. However, for the commodity giants and the nations that depend on them, the environment has become a brutal ""survival of the fittest."" With Brent crude hovering near $60 per barrel and agricultural surpluses mounting, the market is bracing for a year where volume is the only shield against vanishing margins.

The Race to the Bottom: A Timeline of the 2026 Glut

The current state of oversupply did not happen overnight. It is the culmination of a multi-year investment cycle that began in 2022 and 2023, when record-high prices incentivized massive capital expenditures in new extraction technologies and expanded acreage. By late 2024, these projects began coming online just as global demand—particularly from a slowing Chinese industrial sector—started to cool. Throughout 2025, the World Bank and IMF recorded a 7% annual decline in commodity prices, a trend that is forecasted to repeat in 2026.

Key players in this drama include the OPEC+ alliance, which has struggled to maintain production discipline in the face of surging output from non-member nations. The United States and Guyana have emerged as the primary disruptors in the energy sector, with the U.S. Permian Basin reaching unprecedented efficiency levels. Meanwhile, in the metals sector, Indonesia and China have aggressively expanded nickel and lithium processing capacities, deliberately maintaining high output to crash prices and drive higher-cost Western competitors out of the market. This ""Strategic Market Share Defense"" has left the market in a state of bearish stability, where supply remains stubbornly high despite the lack of a price floor.

Winners and Losers in the Low-Cost Era

In this environment, the clear winners are the ""low-cost leaders"" who can remain profitable even at depressed price levels. ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) stands at the forefront of this group. By leveraging its acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources and its advantaged assets in Guyana, ExxonMobil has lowered its breakeven costs to near $30 per barrel. While other energy firms are slashing dividends, ExxonMobil is entering 2026 with a plan to return $20 billion to shareholders, proving that in a low-price world, scale and efficiency are the ultimate competitive advantages.

Conversely, companies like Albemarle (NYSE: ALB) are in a defensive crouch. As the global leader in lithium, Albemarle has been forced to slash its capital expenditure by 65% over the last two years to preserve cash. While they remain a ""strategic survivor"" due to their high-quality assets in Nevada and Australia, the current glut has forced them to move away from fixed-price contracts to dynamic pricing models, hoping to capture any sudden 2026 rebounds. In the agricultural space, Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE: ADM) is navigating thin margins by pivoting toward the ""Bioeconomy."" ADM is restructuring to exit low-margin animal nutrition segments and focusing on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstocks, a move intended to create value-added premiums over traditional, oversupplied grain trading.

The Wider Significance: Geopolitics and the ""Dark Fleet""

The 2026 commodity landscape is not just about supply and demand; it is a mirror of a fragmenting geopolitical order. The persistence of high production is increasingly seen as a tool of economic warfare. By keeping prices low, dominant producers like Indonesia (in nickel) and the U.S. (in oil) are effectively ""starving"" competitors who lack the same subsidies or geological advantages. This trend fits into a broader movement toward ""re-globalization,"" where supply chains are being rerouted to avoid tariff volatility and geopolitical chokepoints.

Furthermore, the rise of the ""Dark Fleet""—a shadow network of tankers carrying sanctioned oil from Russia and Iran—continues to distort market signals. These ""ghost supplies"" keep global inventories higher than official data suggests, complicating the efforts of regulators and central banks to manage inflation. Additionally, the maritime world is bracing for a permanent shift in logistics. With the Suez Canal and Red Sea remaining high-risk zones due to regional instability, shippers are now budgeting for the Cape of Good Hope route as a standard, adding significant lead times and costs that offset some of the benefits of lower commodity prices.

The 2026 Outlook: Shocks on the Horizon

Looking ahead, the primary risk to this era of abundance is a sudden, climate-driven supply shock. Predictive models for 2026 suggest a strong La Niña phase, which historically disrupts harvests in the U.S. Midwest and Brazil while causing flooding in Australian mines. While the market is currently oversupplied, a simultaneous failure in major agricultural and mining hubs could lead to ""localized scarcity"" and violent price spikes, catching over-leveraged buyers off guard.

In the short term, companies will likely continue their strategic pivots. We expect to see more ""green steel"" initiatives from miners like Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO), which is preparing to ship the first major commercial volumes from its Simandou project in Guinea this year. This high-grade iron ore is essential for low-carbon manufacturing, representing a shift from volume-based growth to ""purity-based"" growth. The challenge for 2026 will be managing the transition from a period of glut to a future where supply is increasingly dictated by carbon footprints and geopolitical alignment.

Summary and Investor Takeaways

The global commodity market of 2026 is defined by a fierce battle for dominance in a low-margin world. The ""Production Paradox"" has created a landscape where the strongest players are doubling down on output to squeeze out the weak. For investors, the key takeaway is that ""low-cost"" is no longer just a buzzword; it is a prerequisite for survival. The era of high-beta commodity plays is over, replaced by a focus on operational excellence and balance sheet strength.

Moving forward, the market will be characterized by extreme sensitivity to supply chain disruptions and climate events. Investors should watch for the impact of La Niña on grain prices and any further escalation in trade tariffs that could disrupt the flow of battery metals. While the headline prices remain low, the underlying volatility remains high, making 2026 a year for cautious, quality-focused investing in the resource sector.

*Chuyển đổi xanh để phát triển bền vững

Tổng Giám đốc BSR Nguyễn Việt Thắng cho biết trước xu hướng chuyển dịch năng lượng toàn cầu và cam kết giảm phát thải carbon (Net zero) của Việt Nam, BSR đã nỗ lực nghiên cứu, phát triển và sản xuất nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững (SAF - Sustainable Aviation Fuel). SAF là sản phẩm được nhà máy lọc dầu Dung Quất của BSR phối trộn từ cấu tử bền vững (SBC/Neat SAF) và Jet A-1, phát triển trên cơ sở tiêu chuẩn xăng máy bay Jet A-1 theo tiêu chuẩn kỹ thuật cho nhiên liệu tuabine hàng không chứa hydrocarbon tổng hợp (tiêu chuẩn ASTM D-7566), đảm bảo chất lượng cho động cơ turbine hàng không.

Đây cũng là sản phẩm nằm trong danh mục sản phẩm chủ lực của Petrovietnam và khẳng định quyết tâm của Petrovietnam trong triển khai Nghị quyết số 57-NQ/TW ngày 22/12/2024 của Bộ Chính trị “về đột phá phát triển khoa học, công nghệ, đổi mới sáng tạo và chuyển đổi số quốc gia”. BSR tự hào là một trong những đơn vị tiên phong triển khai thương mại hóa SAF, hướng tới cung cấp giải pháp năng lượng sạch cho các hãng hàng không trong nước và quốc tế, -ông Nguyễn Việt Thắng nhấn mạnh.

Theo ông Hoàng Thanh Sơn - Trưởng ban Nghiên cứu Phát triển BSR, sản phẩm SAF của BSR đã được tổ chức SGS Germany GmbH (Đức) cấp 2 chứng nhận quan trọng gồm ISCC CORSIA và ISCC EU, xác nhận đạt tiêu chuẩn quốc tế trong phối trộn, sản xuất, lưu trữ và thương mại sản phẩm SAF. Việc sở hữu chứng nhận ISCC giúp BSR đủ điều kiện xuất khẩu sản phẩm SAF ra thị trường quốc tế, đặc biệt là thị trường EU - nơi có các quy định nghiêm ngặt nhất về phát thải và năng lượng tái tạo. Chứng nhận cũng là minh chứng cho nỗ lực của BSR trong việc đáp ứng các tiêu chuẩn sản xuất xanh, bền vững và có trách nhiệm với môi trường, là lợi thế để công ty mở rộng hợp tác và ký kết hợp đồng thương mại với các đối tác yêu cầu cao về tính bền vững. Ngoài ra, sản phẩm SAF cũng được BSR hoàn thiện đầy đủ tài liệu kỹ thuật, quy trình sản xuất, pha chế nội bộ và tiêu chuẩn cơ sở TCCS 23:2024-BSR. BSR đã phối hợp chặt chẽ với Công ty TNHH MTV Nhiên liệu Hàng không Việt Nam (Skypec), các hãng hàng không và đơn vị vận chuyển để thiết lập chuỗi cung ứng SAF khép kín đầu tiên tại Việt Nam, từ nhập khẩu nguyên liệu, phối trộn, kiểm soát chất lượng đến cung ứng cho các công ty nhiên liệu hàng không và cấp phát cho các chuyến bay nội địa, quốc tế. Theo kế hoạch, BSR sẽ triển khai sản xuất các lô SAF quy mô lớn hơn và tiến tới thương mại hóa trong thời gian tới, ông Hoàng Thanh Sơn cho biết.

Theo ông Cao Tuấn Sĩ, Giám đốc nhà máy lọc dầu Dung Quất, nhiên liệu SAF đã được Vietnam Airlines bay thử 1 chuyến Đà Nẵng ra Hà Nội thành công. Hiện BSR đang phối hợp với các bên, tập trung nghiên cứu để hạ giá thành sản phẩm.

Cùng với triển khai sản phẩm nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững, BSR cũng sẽ xuất bán sản phẩm xăng sinh học E10RON95 vào ngày 1/6/2026 tới đây. Để đảm bảo nguyên liệu cồn sinh học ethanol cho pha chế xăng sinh học E10RON95 theo quy định với nhu cầu dự kiến khoảng 300 nghìn m3/tháng, BSR sẽ tăng cường mua cồn Ethanol từ các nhà máy sản xuất cồn sinh học trong nước, nhất là từ các nhà máy trong hệ thống của Công ty Cổ phần Đồng Xanh, ngoài ra sẽ nhập khẩu nếu thiếu.

Ngoài ra, sản phẩm E10RON95 của BSR sẽ được phối trộn thêm các phụ gia để chống phân tách lớp, đảm bảo chất lượng sản phẩm theo Quy chuẩn Việt Nam (QCVN). Hiện BSR cũng đang phối hợp với các bên để sớm khởi động lại Nhà máy nhiên liệu sinh học Dung Quất, nhằm chủ động một phần nguồn nguyên liệu tại chỗ cồn Ethanol phục vụ pha chế xăng E10RON95.

*Chuyển đổi số để nâng cao sức cạnh tranh Cùng với chuyển đổi xanh, BSR đang đẩy mạnh triển khai chuyển đổi số, lấy trí tuệ nhân tạo (AI) và mô hình nhà máy thông minh làm hạt nhân để nâng cao năng lực cạnh tranh và phát triển bền vững. Theo đại diện BSR, việc tiến tới mô hình nhà máy thông minh tại BSR không chỉ là xu hướng mà còn là nhu cầu cấp bách để thực hiện quản trị biến động, từ đó giúp phản ứng nhanh với sự thay đổi của giá dầu thô, sản phẩm và nhu cầu thị trường. Bên cạnh đó, việc tiến tới nhà máy thông minh còn giúp BSR tối ưu hóa vận hành ở công suất cao, đa dạng hóa các loại dầu thô mới đầu vào và giảm tiêu thụ năng lượng, giảm phát thải. Ngoài ra, việc số hóa này còn giúp giải quyết vấn đề già hóa máy móc và nhân sự bằng cách số hóa tri thức, hỗ trợ ra quyết định nhanh chóng và chính xác cũng như giúp ngăn ngừa các sự cố dừng máy ngoài kế hoạch và đảm bảo tính toàn vẹn thiết bị. Để hiện thực hóa mục tiêu chuyển đổi số, BSR đã thành lập Ban Chỉ đạo Chuyển đổi số, phê duyệt Chiến lược phát triển khoa học công nghệ đến năm 2030 và thành lập phòng Chuyển đổi số chuyên trách. Công ty đã triển khai kết nối dữ liệu giữa hệ thống vận hành (OT) và công nghệ thông tin (IT), tạo ra nguồn dữ liệu duy nhất, chuẩn hóa và bảo mật. Đây chính là ""nhiên liệu"" đầu vào cho các ứng dụng AI. Theo ông Cao Tuấn Sĩ, BSR đã ứng dụng các công cụ như PI Vision và Power BI để theo dõi tổng thể nhà máy lọc dầu Dung Quất, cảnh báo sớm các bất thường và quản trị các công tác bảo dưỡng, chống ăn mòn theo thời gian thực. Nhờ quản trị số, BSR đã duy trì vận hành các phân xưởng ở công suất cao (CDU 118%, RFCC 110%), góp phần tăng doanh thu thêm khoảng 1.540 tỷ đồng. Trong giai đoạn tới, BSR tập trung vào các bài toán AI chuyên sâu để chuyển từ vận hành phản ứng sang quản lý chủ động: Sử dụng AI/ Machine Learning (học máy) để dự báo hỏng hóc cho các thiết bị quan trọng và ăn mòn đỉnh tháp; ứng dụng mô hình Bản sao số (digital Twin) cho các phân xưởng quan trọng nhằm tối ưu hóa vận hành và tiến tới mô hình số hóa toàn diện nhà máy. BSR cũng đặt mục tiêu hình thành trung tâm vận hành số hợp nhất (UDOC) trên cơ sở tích hợp dữ liệu từ sản xuất đến quản trị doanh nghiệp (tài chính, nhân sự, chuỗi cung ứng) trên một nền tảng duy nhất, từ đó giúp lãnh đạo ra quyết định dựa trên phân tích dữ liệu chuyên sâu. Với phương châm ""dữ liệu là nền tảng, AI là công cụ, và quản trị hiệu quả là mục tiêu cuối cùng"", BSR đang từng bước hình thành hệ sinh thái quản trị thông minh, sẵn sàng cho các mục tiêu phát triển bền vững và hội nhập quốc tế, đại diện BSR cho biết. Năm 2025, BSR đã vận hành nhà máy lọc dầu Dung Quất an toàn, ổn định với công suất bình quân quy đổi lên tới 120%. Công ty cũng tận dụng hiệu quả “cửa sổ cơ hội” khi giá dầu thô giảm trong khi giá sản phẩm không giảm tương ứng, thậm chí có thời điểm đi ngược chiều, qua đó tối ưu hóa biên lợi nhuận. Đặc biệt, BSR chủ động điều hành sản xuất và tiêu thụ bám sát các kịch bản sản xuất kinh doanh được xây dựng và cập nhật thường xuyên theo diễn biến giá dầu và crack spread, từ đó linh hoạt điều chỉnh công suất, gia tăng tồn kho chiến lược và đẩy mạnh tiêu thụ khi thị trường thuận lợi. Nhờ vậy, BSR ước đạt sản lượng 7.907.293 tấn, tương đương 108% kế hoạch quản trị; doanh thu đạt 142.800 tỷ đồng; lợi nhuận trước thuế đạt 4.700 tỷ đồng; nộp ngân sách nhà nước 14.300 tỷ đồng. Những con số này tiếp tục khẳng định vai trò then chốt của BSR trong phát triển kinh tế địa phương cũng như đóng góp vào an ninh năng lượng quốc gia. Với kết quả sản xuất kinh doanh vượt trội, năm 2025, BSR được Petrovietnam vinh danh là đơn vị hoàn thành toàn diện kế hoạch quản trị, đồng thời lọt Top 7 thương hiệu lớn nhất thị trường niêm yết theo bình chọn của Forbes Việt Nam. Đây là sự ghi nhận xứng đáng cho chiến lược vận hành hiệu quả, tư duy quản trị linh hoạt và năng lực cạnh tranh ngày càng được nâng cao của doanh nghiệp.

The recognition underlines the depth of regional cooperation at a time when the island nation faced one of its deadliest climate disasters in recent years.

Recognition by Sri Lanka Navy

The Sri Lanka Navy honoured eight foreign naval vessels, including two from India, for providing immediate assistance after Cyclone Ditwah struck in late November. Sri Lanka’s Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya personally conveyed gratitude to diplomatic representatives of the assisting countries. The cyclone triggered widespread flooding, landslides, and infrastructure collapse, overwhelming national disaster-response systems.

Role of Indian Naval Assets

Indian Navy ships INS Vikrant and INS Udayagiri were among the first foreign vessels to respond. Both ships were initially in Sri Lankan waters to participate in the International Fleet Review 2025 marking the navy’s 75th anniversary. Following the cyclone’s landfall on November 27, these vessels were swiftly redeployed for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations.

Operation Sagar Bandhu and Relief Scale

India launched Operation Sagar Bandhu on the very day Cyclone Ditwah made landfall. The mission delivered more than 1,100 tonnes of relief material, including food rations, tents, tarpaulins, clothing, hygiene kits, and water purification equipment. Around 14.5 tonnes of medicines and medical equipment were supplied, along with an additional 60 tonnes of logistical support material. Helicopters deployed from INS Vikrant played a key role in aerial rescue and supply drops.

Beberapa waktu belakangan, penulis kerap bepergian ke berbagai destinasi wisata di Indonesia, sebuah kebiasaan yang menjadi titik balik reflektif mendalam. Sebagai traveler yang sejak kecil menjelajahi dunia, penulis dulu jarang nikmati keindahan negeri sendiri.

Belakangan apresiasi terhadap Indonesia tumbuh pesat. Siapa sangka, wisata lokal menghasilkan emisi karbon lebih rendah, mendukung masyarakat setempat, sekaligus memacu produk domestik bruto (PDB) nasional.

Pengalaman bepergian ini bukan sekadar liburan, melainkan mata air awal penulisan ini dalam membedah paradoks pariwisata kita: wisata bisa jadi pilar ketiga keberlanjutan, ekonomi, sosial, lingkungan, jika dikelola benar.

Wisata meningkatkan PDB, tapi dampak lingkungannya merusak. Destinasi seperti Bali dan Labuan Bajo (Nusa Tenggara Timur) yang diwarnai overtourism mengalami erosi pantai, kerusakan terumbu karang, dan sumber daya alam menipis. Penulis yakin implementasi kebijakan wisata lokal yang tepat bisa memacu ekonomi sekaligus menjaga lingkungan dan meningkatkan kesejahteraan sosial.

Praktik baik sudah ada. Stasiun pengisian ulang botol air minum telah tersedia di Bandara Internasional Soekarno-Hatta Tangerang dan Bandara Internasional I Gusti Ngurah Rai Badung. Hal tersebut mendukung reuse daripada plastik sekali pakai.

Penulis menyarankan agar praktik tersebut diperluas ke stasiun kereta, terminal bus, dan pelabuhan. Selama bepergian dua bulan terakhir, penulis menginap di resor yang mana ada penanaman sayur dan buah sendiri, mengurangi emisi GHG transportasi.

Sheraton Belitung Resort misalnya memperoleh Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) dari PLN pada Mei 2024. Mereka merupakan resor pertama Bangka Belitung di mana sebagian besar energinya berasal dari sumber terbarukan. Mereka menggunakan pasir berpori penyerap air hujan untuk lantai, sebuah langkah yang berkontribusi mengurangi kebutuhan pembersih kimia.

Selain itu, Dialoog Banyuwangi telah menerapkan inisiatif farm-to-table melalui kebun organiknya sendiri, di mana sayur dan rempah segar langsung dipanen untuk restoran. Langkah tersebut mengurangi jejak karbon transportasi makanan dan mendukung pertanian lokal berkelanjutan.

Sayangnya implementasi masih minim. Hanya segelintir resor yang menerapkan langkah tersebut. Stasiun refill belum merata. Pemerintah wajib mendorong resor dan Airbnb memisahkan sampah tamu, beri insentif pajak bagi yang membangun desain bersertifikat berkelanjutan serta transisi ke energi terbarukan.

Pemerintah juga wajib mewajibkan analisis siklus hidup (life-cycle analysis) pada operasional mereka untuk meminimalkan limbah dan emisi. Selain itu, kolaborasi dengan agen travel bagikan ""sustainable travel kit"" seperti reusable cotton pads, gelas tahan lama, kurangi plastik sekali pakai dan sikat gigi disposable.

Luncurkan program ""Refill Cup Favoritmu"" diskon minuman bagi wisatawan yang membawa gelas sendiri di setiap stasiun transportasi umum. Pemerintah juga harus mewajibkan industri hotel dan Airbnb merilis laporan dampak transparan setiap tahun.

Pemerintah jangan melewatkan momentum emas ini! Kebijakan tegas wisata berkelanjutan bukan beban, melainkan investasi cerdas memacu PDB, menciptakan lapangan kerja lokal, dan menjaga warisan alam untuk generasi mendatang.

Penulis memiliki keyakinan penuh kalau Indonesia bisa menjadi destinasi wisata hijau dunia jika bergerak dari sekarang. Pembaca CNBC Indonesia, saatnya mendukung revolusi ini!

A ideia de desenvolvimento com foco na sustentabilidade — economia limpa (de baixo carbono), produção responsável e consumo consciente dos recursos — vem sendo utilizada como promotora de um novo projeto de sociedade, mais eficiente e responsável, capaz de garantir, no presente e no futuro, as mesmas chances de crescimento, porém dentro de novas oportunidades de exploração econômica, sem comprometer a manutenção dos serviços prestados pela natureza. Exatamente o que estamos prestes a vivenciar por aqui.

O Rio Grande do Sul vem experimentando eventos climáticos extremos de toda ordem, desde secas recorrentes até chuvas volumosas, seguidas de granizo e ventos intensos. Um cenário assustador, de prejuízos e perdas incalculáveis, que somente poderá ser revertido a partir de um novo modelo de desenvolvimento econômico, verde e sustentável.

Na Zona Sul, projetam-se iniciativas que devem mudar nossa realidade econômica a partir do próximo ano: investimentos bilionários em logística, energia e indústria, especialmente na indústria naval e em atividades relacionadas à cadeia produtiva do agronegócio. São iniciativas que nos conectam diretamente à corrida global pela descarbonização das atividades econômicas.

A conversão da Refinaria Riograndense, em Rio Grande, na primeira biorrefinaria do país é o melhor exemplo dessa mudança. Trata-se de um investimento de US$ 1 bilhão, com impacto direto na cadeia produtiva de grãos oleaginosos. Um projeto inovador que abre novas oportunidades no campo, seja pela necessidade de adoção de práticas mais sustentáveis de manejo e conservação do solo e da água — impulsionadas pelas exigências de certificação e de acesso ao mercado internacional —, seja pela qualificação da cadeia de insumos, dos serviços, da rede de cerealistas e das esmagadoras de grãos, responsáveis pela produção de óleos estabilizados destinados à fabricação de combustíveis verdes: gasolina, diesel, solventes, gás e o SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel — combustível sustentável de aviação), considerado o mais valioso dos combustíveis e a principal medida de descarbonização do setor aéreo para a redução de emissões e o combate às mudanças climáticas.

Outra grande oportunidade que se avizinha é a geração eólica offshore — energia gerada pelo vento no oceano —, que deverá nos apresentar uma oferta de energia nunca vista, muito além da nossa demanda atual. Esse cenário certamente atrairá novos investimentos para a região: indústrias e novas cadeias de negócios que ainda irão nos descobrir a partir da oferta abundante de energia e da posição logística estratégica, com conexões com o interior do país e com o mundo. Uma perspectiva que, aos poucos, vem sendo confirmada pelos investimentos já anunciados e por outros que devem chegar em breve.

A partir da geração offshore, será possível avançar na produção de hidrogênio verde, incluindo o desenvolvimento da indústria do oxigênio. Com hidrogênio disponível, limpo e em abundância, o céu é o limite: abrem-se oportunidades para a produção de fertilizantes verdes, essenciais na cadeia de insumos de baixo carbono para a produção de combustíveis verdes. E, já que ao final do esmagamento de grãos oleaginosos o que sobra é uma grande quantidade de resíduos (farelo de alto poder proteico e sustentável), estes servem de base para dietas humanas (livres de proteína animal) ou para a produção de ração destinada ao gado confinado.

A pecuária gaúcha, que sempre esteve em destaque no cenário nacional, pode estar próxima de viver uma nova realidade, juntamente com outras fontes de proteína animal, como frango e suínos, ainda pouco desenvolvidas na região: uma vantagem estratégica de reposicionamento no mercado como carne verde, produzida em sistemas de baixa emissão de gases de efeito estufa (GEE), com maior valor agregado e voltada a um público consumidor exigente, especialmente o mercado internacional futuro.

Por outro lado, não será preciso esperar tanto, pois já existe um forte interesse em investir aqui, certamente guiado pela nossa vantagem logística e pelo potencial de geração de energia: o investimento do grupo espanhol Cobra Brasil, de cerca de R$ 6 bilhões, em uma unidade de geração termelétrica, que deverá consumir 5,5 milhões de metros cúbicos de gás natural por dia e gerar 1.200 megawatts de energia. O gás natural, apesar de ser uma fonte fóssil, é menos poluente e essencial como combustível de transição, atuando como ponte para fontes mais limpas e sustentáveis; o investimento de R$ 1,5 bilhão da joint venture entre CMPC Celulose e Neltume Ports para a implantação de um novo terminal portuário. O projeto prevê a construção de dois berços de atracação para navios, dois berços para barcaças e um armazém com capacidade para armazenar 190 mil toneladas de celulose; o investimento de R$ 110 milhões anunciado pela Fontes Verdes, empresa paulista que atua há 15 anos no mercado de hidrogênio e amônia verdes, que avalia o início de suas operações no segundo semestre de 2026; o anúncio do Governo Federal da construção de cinco navios gaseiros no Estaleiro Rio Grande e da passagem seca para São José do Norte…

Um ano que promete ser marcado por boas notícias e novidades, como a produção de etanol de arroz, possivelmente a única alternativa capaz de oferecer a esse tradicional e importante ativo agrícola uma nova rota de utilização, agregando valor, propósito e sustentabilidade à cadeia de negócios.

The facility turns waste fats, including poultry fat, beef tallow and used cooking oil, into sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.
Its plants in Louisiana and Texas produce about 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel annually, with production of aviation fuel starting in December 2024.
Backman-Flamerich said current aviation fuel made from waste relies entirely on byproducts from food production, avoiding concerns about growing crops specifically for fuel.
The growing link between poultry production, waste processing and aviation shows how byproducts from one industry can become valuable inputs for another, reducing waste while supporting emission cuts.","United Airlines is turning to waste fats from poultry production as part of its efforts to meet long-term climate goals, with sustainable aviation fuel playing a growing role in its plans to cut emissions, reports WattPoultry.

The airline aims to reduce carbon pollution per passenger seat by 50 per cent by 2035 compared with 2019 levels and to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Sustainable aviation fuel is expected to deliver a significant share of these reductions, accounting for about 17 per cent of the airline’s path to net zero through fuels already in use.

Speaking at the US Roundtable for Sustainable Poultry and Eggs annual meeting, held alongside the 2025 Poultry Tech Summit, United’s senior manager for environmental sustainability, Ryan Backman-Flamerich, said most of the company’s emissions come directly from burning jet fuel. He noted that fuel use from aircraft engines makes up about 98 per cent of the airline’s total emissions.

Aviation currently produces about 3 per cent of global emissions, but that share is expected to rise as other sectors cut pollution more quickly. Backman-Flamerich said that while industries such as power generation are reducing emissions, aviation must move faster or risk becoming a larger part of the global problem even if its own emissions fall.

A key part of United’s strategy involves working with Darling Ingredients, a company that processes animal byproducts and operates Diamond Green Diesel, a joint venture with Valero. The facility turns waste fats, including poultry fat, beef tallow and used cooking oil, into sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.

Darling Ingredients’ director of sustainability, Ethan Carter, said the company processes nearly 1.5 million tonnes of low-emission raw materials each year for biofuel production. Its plants in Louisiana and Texas produce about 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel annually, with production of aviation fuel starting in December 2024.

Carter said the process ensures that animal byproducts are fully used, helping the poultry and food industries reduce waste while supporting cleaner fuel production. He added that most of the fats collected in North America, including poultry fat, are sent to Diamond Green Diesel for conversion into renewable fuels.

He acknowledged that poultry fat can be more difficult to process due to higher levels of impurities, meaning it cannot be used on its own. However, he said it can still be blended and successfully processed at the facility.

Backman-Flamerich said current aviation fuel made from waste relies entirely on byproducts from food production, avoiding concerns about growing crops specifically for fuel. He added that the industry is still far from reaching the limits of this fuel technology, leaving room for further growth.

Carter said closer links across the supply chain allow companies to expand production and help customers meet their climate targets.

The growing link between poultry production, waste processing and aviation shows how byproducts from one industry can become valuable inputs for another, reducing waste while supporting emission cuts. Backman-Flamerich said progress depends on cooperation across the entire aviation supply chain, including fuel producers and agricultural partners.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-8.png,N,,2026-01-01 05:11:43.044172

Easier Connections via Major European Hubs

The agreement builds on an earlier interline arrangement signed in June 2025 and marks another milestone in Air India’s global expansion strategy.

Under the partnership, passengers can now book journeys to Riga, Latvia, and onward destinations on a single Air India ticket, enjoying simplified transfers through key European gateways.

The codeshare allows Air India to place its “AI” flight code on airBaltic-operated services between Riga and major European cities, including Amsterdam, Paris, Frankfurt, Copenhagen, Milan, Vienna, Zurich, and London Gatwick.

These hubs are already served by Air India, creating seamless onward connections for travellers heading to Northern and Eastern Europe.

For Indian passengers, the agreement removes much of the complexity previously associated with reaching the Baltic region. Instead of juggling multiple airlines and bookings, travellers can now rely on a single itinerary with coordinated schedules and baggage handling.

Strengthening Air India’s Global Network

The collaboration reflects Air India’s broader push to rebuild and modernise its international footprint following privatisation in 2022.

Nipun Aggarwal, Air India’s Chief Commercial Officer, said the partnership complements the airline’s existing European services and aligns with rising demand for travel between India and emerging European destinations. He highlighted airBaltic’s strong presence in the Baltics and Scandinavia as a natural fit for Air India’s network.

Opening the Door to the Baltic Region

The agreement offers Indian travellers easier access to Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, regions gaining popularity for both leisure and business travel. Riga, known for its medieval old town and vibrant cultural scene, is fast emerging as a convenient gateway to the Baltics.

The test, conducted on December 30, 2025, clears the enhanced stage for induction into upcoming SSLV flight missions and strengthens India’s launch-on-demand capability.

Successful Static Firing at Sriharikota

According to “Indian Space Research Organisation”, the static ground test of the improved SS3 motor was carried out at the Solid Motor Static Test Facility of the “Satish Dhawan Space Centre”. The motor was fired for 108 seconds, with all performance parameters closely matching pre-test predictions. The SS3 stage is the uppermost solid stage of SSLV and is critical for imparting the required velocity to place satellites into orbit.

Key Design Upgrades and Payload Gain

A major enhancement in the upgraded SS3 motor is the introduction of a carbon-epoxy composite motor case, replacing the earlier configuration. This redesign has significantly reduced the inert mass of the stage, resulting in a payload gain of about 90 kg for the SSLV. The third stage alone delivers velocities of up to 4 km per second. Additional improvements have been made to the igniter and nozzle systems to enhance efficiency, robustness, and overall performance margins while retaining reliability.

Advanced Control and Monitoring Systems

During the test, the SS3 motor was instrumented with around 233 sensors to monitor pressure, thrust, temperature, vibration, and the behaviour of control electronics and actuators. Nozzle control is achieved through a fault-tolerant electro-mechanical actuation system supported by low-power control electronics. Isro stated that these upgrades collectively strengthen operational efficiency and mission assurance for future SSLV launches.

Imporatnt Facts for Exams

SSLV is a three-stage, all-solid launch vehicle designed for rapid launch readiness.

The SS3 is the uppermost stage and provides up to 4 km/s velocity.

In 2025, SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes, equivalent to 2.4 billion litres, up from around 1 million tonnes in 2024.
Despite the increase, SAF production in 2025 will represent just 0.6 per cent of total jet fuel consumption, rising to 0.8 per cent the following year.
Of that amount, $1.4bn reflects the standard SAF price premium over conventional jet fuel.

In 2025, SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes, equivalent to 2.4 billion litres, up from around 1 million tonnes in 2024.

However, growth is projected to slow in 2026, with production rising to 2.4m tonnes.

Despite the increase, SAF production in 2025 will represent just 0.6 per cent of total jet fuel consumption, rising to 0.8 per cent the following year.

At current price levels, the SAF premium is expected to translate into an additional $3.6bn in fuel costs for the airline industry in 2025.

IATA said the estimated SAF output for 2025 represents a downward revision from earlier forecasts, citing a lack of policy support to fully utilise installed SAF capacity.

At the same time, SAF prices exceed those of fossil-based jet fuel by around a factor of two, and by up to five times in markets where mandates apply, the association said.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh said that “SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry”.

“If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park,” he said, adding that if the objective was to increase SAF production and support aviation decarbonisation, regulators needed to “learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work”.

Against this backdrop, IATA was sharply critical of SAF mandates introduced in the European Union and the United Kingdom, arguing that they have failed to accelerate production while significantly increasing costs for airlines.

In Europe, the ReFuelEU Aviation framework has pushed costs higher amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains.

Fuel suppliers have widened their profit margins to the extent that airlines are paying up to five times more than the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF, IATA said, without guaranteed supply or consistent documentation.

In the UK, the SAF mandate has triggered price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the financial burden.

As a result, airlines paid a cumulative premium of $2.9bn for the limited 1.9m tonnes of SAF available in 2025, according to IATA.

Of that amount, $1.4bn reflects the standard SAF price premium over conventional jet fuel.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production,” Walsh said, noting that while the European Commission’s recent Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) announcement was a step forward, it lacked a clear timeline.

Turning to the impact on airline climate commitments, IATA warned that the failure to accelerate SAF production capacity would force many carriers to review their targets.

“Regrettably, many airlines that have committed to use 10 per cent SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments,” Walsh said, adding that SAF was “not being produced in sufficient amounts” to enable airlines to achieve those ambitions. He said the commitments had been made in good faith but “simply cannot be delivered”.

Looking ahead, IATA cautioned against repeating the same policy mistakes as mandates for synthetic aviation fuels, or e-SAF, approach in the UK in 2028 and in the EU in 2030.

Already, e-SAF faces a much higher cost base, potentially up to 12 times that of conventional jet fuel.

Without strong production incentives rather than mandates, IATA said supply would fall short of targets.

Under the current policy framework, compliance costs could rise to as much as €29bn by 2032 if targets are not met, which the association said was likely.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice president for sustainability and chief economist said that “Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect.”

She said regulators must “course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down”, adding that mandates had “done just the opposite” and that it was “outrageous to repeat the same mistakes with e-SAF mandates”.",https://cyprus-mail.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/airplane-air-travel-aviation-aeroplane-flying.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 01:11:53.902841

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

So is Gevo a game-changer or a potential total flop? Real talk, it’s somewhere in the middle. Here are the three big things you need to understand before you even think about touching this stock.

1. The Big Pitch: Net-Zero Fuel For Jets And Trucks

Gevo’s core flex is this: take things like corn and other feedstocks, run them through its tech, and turn them into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and low-carbon gasoline and diesel. The goal is to make fuel that can drop into existing engines but comes with a much lower carbon footprint.

Why this matters: Airlines, shipping, and logistics giants are under massive pressure to hit climate targets. Governments and regulators are tightening rules, and brands want to brag about climate wins. If Gevo can reliably supply low-carbon fuel at scale and at a competitive cost, it plugs into a huge market.

The catch: Building and running these plants is insanely capital intensive. It’s not an app. It’s hard engineering, big construction, and long timelines. That means delays, cost overruns, and funding risk are always lurking.

2. The Deals: Long-Term Contracts… If They Actually Play Out

One reason people get hyped on Gevo: it has signed multiple offtake agreements (long-term deals) with airlines and big buyers who say they’ll take future volumes of Gevo’s low-carbon fuels.

That sounds bullish, but here’s the twist:

These contracts often depend on Gevo building out enough production capacity.

Timelines can be delayed by permits, funding, tech ramp-up, or market conditions.

Not all announced deals are guaranteed to turn into full cash flow.

Translation: The pipeline looks impressive on slides, but investors are still waiting for meaningful, consistent revenue to catch up with the promises.

3. The Risk Profile: Volatile, Dilutive, And Not For Tourists

Price performance has been a roller coaster. GEVO has had moments of insane spikes when climate policy or airline news hits, followed by brutal pullbacks. Over a longer window, the stock has struggled to hold onto its highest levels and has traded much lower than past peaks.

Because it’s a small-cap clean-tech play, Gevo often needs to raise more money to fund its projects. That can mean share dilution – new shares issued, existing shareholders get diluted, and the price can get pressured. If you hate watching your position swing double digits in a week, this stock will stress you out.

Gevo Inc vs. The Competition

Gevo is not the only one trying to own the sustainable aviation fuel story. Its main clout war is with other companies working on low-carbon fuels and SAF.

Who It’s Up Against

Other SAF and renewable fuel players that already have larger scale or deeper backing.

Big oil and energy companies pivoting into green fuel with serious money and infrastructure.

Alternative climate plays like EVs, batteries, and hydrogen, which compete for investor attention.

In terms of brand clout, some rivals and bigger energy brands win because they’re more established and have more visible commercial-scale plants already operating. But Gevo still gets a lot of niche attention because it’s pure-play, high-upside if it works, and trades like a classic speculative story stock.

So who wins the clout war?

For stability and scale: Larger, more diversified players take the W.

For raw hype and moonshot energy: Gevo still pulls eyeballs in the penny/green growth crowd.

If you want a steadier climate exposure, Gevo is probably not your first pick. If you’re chasing asymmetric upside and can mentally handle the chaos, that’s where Gevo sits.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

Let’s answer the only question you actually care about: Is it worth the hype?

Gevo is NOT a safe, passive long-term sleep-well-at-night stock. It’s a speculative climate-tech bet that could pay off big if everything lines up – funding, construction, execution, policy, and customer adoption – or bleed out slowly if those pieces don’t come together.

Here’s the real talk breakdown:

Must-have? Only if you fully understand that this is high-risk and you treat it like a speculative side play, not the core of your portfolio.

Game-changer? The tech and vision absolutely could be game-changing for aviation and low-carbon fuels. The business still has to prove it can scale and generate strong, sustainable cash flow.

Price drop opportunity? Dips can look tempting, but timing this kind of stock is brutal. It can always go lower than you think.

If you’re the type who YOLOs into trending names just because they’re viral, this is a drop until you’ve done serious homework. If you’re a climate-tech nerd willing to hold through chaos and understand that this could go very right or very wrong, then it’s a cautious, highly speculative cop – with small sizing only.

Either way, if you jump in, you’re signing up for a ride. No autopilot here.

The Business Side: GEVO

Here’s the quick company context you need before you start flexing your positions on social:

Company: Gevo Inc

Ticker: GEVO

ISIN: US3743964062

Sector: Clean energy / low-carbon fuels / sustainable aviation fuel

Profile: Small-cap, development-heavy, capital-intensive projects, long build-out timelines

From the last available market data (cross-checked on major finance sites), GEVO trades in the low single-digit dollar range with big percentage swings and heavy sensitivity to headlines. That’s classic speculative territory, not quiet blue-chip land.

Before you decide to cop or drop:

Read the latest earnings and project updates on Gevo’s official site.

Check the live price and chart action on your broker or a finance portal.

“Projects like this are crucial to helping to reduce global carbon emissions, while creating jobs and growing our economy,” said Timothy Halman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change. “And when we welcome projects like this, it continues to position Nova Scotia as a leader in climate change action, innovation and the global clean energy transformation.”

The company will need a second environmental assessment approval for its second phase – a proposed wind energy and solar farm and a transmission line to supply renewable energy for fuel production.

The company expects the project will create about 1,000 jobs during the construction phase, up to 80 jobs during its operation (expected to end in 2081) and direct and indirect economic benefits for local businesses, communities and residents.

The project must comply with 34 stringent terms and conditions in its environmental assessment approval that are designed to protect the environment and human health. The project will also require an industrial approval and a water withdrawal approval.

Quick Facts:

The company would create a new market for Nova Scotia’s oversupply of biomass from forestry activity, including wood chips and bark that are the byproduct of silviculture, harvesting and sawmilling.

The Minister of Environment and Climate Change – the province's environmental regulator – uses the Environment Act and is guided by science and evidence when reviewing environmental assessment requests.

If a project is approved, the regulator typically includes terms and conditions which are designed to ensure the environment and people remain protected throughout the life of the project, while also allowing viable, safe and responsible development to take place.

The Department's inspection, compliance and enforcement staff ensure companies comply with the terms and conditions of their various approvals; in 2024, they conducted about 6,400 inspections to ensure companies were complying with Nova Scotia’s environmental rules and laws.

Hemp growers and retailers in Texas breathed a sigh of relief earlier this year when Governor Greg Abbott vetoed a state ban on hemp-based THC products but those in the industry are again concerned after Congress passed a bill banning all hemp-derived THC currently on the market.

Jonathan Miller, general counsel for the U.S. Hemp Roundtable, said the legislation is already having a negative impact on the industry.

""Farmers who grew hemp that was harvested in October are now having problems selling their products on the marketplace,"" Miller reported. ""Prices had dropped, some places by 40 percent. Given the uncertainty farmers don’t know whether to plant seeds in the ground, this spring – they have to make decisions now.""

The Texas hemp industry contributes more than $5 billion to the state’s economy and has created more than 53,000 jobs.

The national ban is scheduled to go into effect in November of next year but last week, President Donald Trump issued an executive order calling for cannabis to be rescheduled as a Schedule III substance. It also calls for regulators to work on legal exceptions for some hemp-based products.

Miller pointed out growers see the executive order as a lifeline but admitted the industry needs more regulations and will work with lawmakers over the next 11 months to make changes.

""So that farmers can make their decision and fully have enough time to develop a regulatory framework to replace the ban,"" Miller explained. ""We’re working with members of Congress to introduce and hopefully pass bills that would crack down (on) the bad actors, would robustly regulate hemp products.""

Miller stressed they support drafting new legislation to replace the total ban with regulations requiring good manufacturing practices, truth in labeling, bans on synthetic THC and strong measures to keep products out of the hands of children.",https://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2025-12-31 13:56:32.337395

Airbus’ concept, with the bird-inspired training, the advancement of SAF and technological improvements backed up by big airplane companies, has already shown interesting results.","Airbus, one of the biggest air companies in Europe, is trying a new flying formation, inspired in birds, to save fuel. The project is called Fello’fly and its goal is to optimize routes using the aerodynamic ascent created by an aircraft flying in front. This method will help reducing fuel consumption, cutting emissions and helping airlines save some money.

They believe that air companies could spend less money on combustion if they could copy how migratory birds fly together. Airbus states that they can reduce fuel in long-haul destinations without changing or modifying their existing planes.

They propose to take advantage of the dynamics of airflow, which is similar to the “slipstream” effect—like they do in Formula 1.

Fello’fly: A pairing flights concept

For this concept you need two planes; one will be leading, and while it flies, it leaves a wake behind, that creates a slight support upwards. The second aircraft can then “ride” that flow to improve efficiency, thanks to the energy it recovers from the first plane’s wake.

Airbus has already done a few trials with Air France, Delta Air Lines, French bee, and Virgin Atlantic to validate that the concept works and it’s actually doable in a safe manner, with precision and respecting all regulations.

According to BFM Business, the company executed 8 flights over the North Atlantic between September and October 2025. And these tests demonstrated that it was possible to guide two planes to a precise meeting point (“Rendez-vous”) while keeping the designated distance by the air control.

This could redice up to 5% of fuel requirements in long flights if it is done for commercial flights, according to the air company. Eventually reducing CO₂ too.

What the trials confirm—and what they don’t

When Fello’fly uses the wake the leading plane leaves, this reduces the need to push, and burned fuel. The potential benefit (up to 5% in saving fuel) is still relevant because of rising costs and increasing climate pressure. However, the total impact is more limited than that with all the challenges in structure, like the high cost of cleaner fuels, the shortage of new aircraft and the constant growth of air traffic.

Airbus projects that there will be about 8 billion passengers by 2040—higher than the 4.5 billion in 2019; meaning more flights, and a larger global fleet.

A study by Transport & Environment shows that the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) will grow; but, even if the SAF reaches 42% as required by European standards, the sector would burn as much fossil kerosene in 2049 as it did in 2023.

Efficiency in the air—and less fossil fuels

For passengers and airlines, Fello’fly aims for slightly more efficient long-haul flights, with fewer emissions and potential operational savings without changing planes.

And overall, it is a solution that could be implemented in today’s commercial flights without changing much for the customers. It might not fix the whole fuel consumption issue, but it could help to reduce the use of it.

We will still need cleaner fuels, more efficient floats and a better management of traffic growth. But what this air company is doing, it is still very important, because is not about one method, or another; it’s about finding solutions, that together will contribute to a greener and less expensive way to fly.

Airbus’ concept, with the bird-inspired training, the advancement of SAF and technological improvements backed up by big airplane companies, has already shown interesting results. However, the data shows that, even with ambitious SAF quotas, the sector will continue to face a major challenge to reduce the use of fossil kerosene at the rhythm that the industry is asking for it.",https://www.blanquivioletas.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Airbus-tests-aircraft.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 14:57:18.485516

Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared with fossil-based jet fuel.","Neste has agreed to supply sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to the Cathay Group for operations in the European Union, the United States, and Asia-Pacific, expanding deliveries across three regions and scaling the airline group’s use of SAF. The agreement centers on Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel program and relies on its existing global supply infrastructure, integrating the fuel into airport distribution systems where Cathay operates passenger and cargo flights.

Under the agreement, Neste is delivering blended SAF for Cathay Pacific flights at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the European Union and Los Angeles International Airport in the United States. In Asia-Pacific, Neste is supplying SAF at Singapore Changi Airport for Air Hong Kong, the cargo airline owned by the Cathay Group. In each location, the SAF is blended with conventional jet fuel and supplied through standard airport fueling systems.

Cathay Pacific says the agreement supports its broader decarbonization strategy by expanding access to SAF across its network. “Partnering with Neste represents a key step toward our shared vision of decarbonizing air transport,” says Kristof Van Passel, Head of Procurement Operations and Sustainability, Cathay Pacific. “This collaboration is part of our multifaceted strategy to accelerate the adoption of SAF across our global network, strengthening our commitment to innovation and sustainability, and ensuring a tangible impact for our customers and the industry. SAF continues to be the most viable solution currently available to address flight emissions.”

Neste says the agreement reflects its focus on supporting airlines with multinational operations. Mario Mifsud, Vice President of Renewable Fuels Sales and Commercial for EMEA and APAC, Neste, says the company’s production and distribution capabilities enable airlines to increase SAF use across regions. “Our global production and distribution capabilities allow international airlines like Cathay to scale the use of SAF, a key tool for reducing emissions in aviation,” he adds. “At the same time, it enables their customers to reduce the carbon footprint of their travel and logistics operations.”

Neste MY SAF is produced from waste and renewable raw materials, including used cooking oil and residual animal fats. The fuel is certified for commercial aviation use and can be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel without requiring modifications to aircraft engines or airport fueling infrastructure.

Neste’s global SAF production capacity stands at 1.5 million metric t per year, says the company. It plans to expand that capacity to 2.2 million metric t annually by 2027. Across all renewable fuel products, Neste expects total production capacity to reach 6.8 million metric t per year by the same year.

For aviation, where near-term electrification is not viable for long-haul routes, SAF is widely viewed as the most practical option to cut lifecycle emissions. Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared with fossil-based jet fuel. The fuel is certified for commercial aviation use. It can be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel. This enables immediate deployment across existing airline operations.

Neste MY SAF is compatible with aircraft engines and airport fueling infrastructure, reducing operational disruption for airlines. It allows gradual decarbonization without major capital investment in new fleets or systems. The approach is increasingly relevant as the European Union, North America, and parts of Asia drive stricter emissions requirements.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-12/saf-scaled%20%281%29.jpg?h=e85d0bda&itok=y_SslJIY,N,,2025-12-31 12:56:57.268785

Approximately 80% of Darling's North American fats, including poultry fat, flow to DGD for conversion into renewable fuels.
Carter noted one unique challenge: ""Poultry fat tends to have some higher impurities than we can handle at the facility.
So you could never run 100% poultry fat.
But we are able to run poultry fat in the facility at DGD and we do.""","United Airlines is betting on waste fats from poultry production to help achieve its ambitious climate targets, with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) emerging as a critical tool in the carrier's decarbonization strategy.

The airline, one of the world's largest, aims to reduce carbon intensity per passenger seat by 50% by 2035 compared to 2019 levels and reach net zero emissions by 2050. SAF will account for a substantial portion of these reductions — representing 17% of the pathway to net zero through first-generation SAF alone.

""Most of our emissions come from the tail of our aircraft,"" with jet fuel combustion represents 98% of United's emissions footprint, Ryan Backman-Flamerich, United's senior manager of environmental sustainability, told attendees at the U.S. Roundtable for Sustainable Poultry and Eggs (US-RSPE) annual meeting, co-located with the 2025 Poultry Tech Summit.

Currently accounting for about 3% of global emissions, aviation's share is expected to grow as other sectors decarbonize more rapidly.

""We know that other sectors are decarbonizing. We know that the power sector is decarbonizing, and that will have effects for other industries,"" he said. ""Even as we work to decarbonize, if we did nothing, our share of that 3% will get larger.""

The rendering connection

Enter Darling Ingredients, which processes 15% of the world's animal byproducts and operates Diamond Green Diesel (DGD), a joint venture with Valero. The facility converts waste fats — including poultry fat, beef tallow and used cooking oil — into SAF using a process called HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids).

Ethan Carter, director of sustainability at Darling Ingredients, emphasized that the company processes nearly 1.5 million metric tons of low-carbon intensity feedstock annually for biofuels. DGD's facilities in Louisiana and Texas produce approximately 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel yearly, with SAF production beginning in December 2024.

""Every part of the animal is getting used,"" Carter said, highlighting rendering's role in the poultry industry's sustainability story. ""We're looking at collecting materials from animal agriculture, from food industries, and really helping with the sustainability there, helping everyone in this room with your sustainability story.""

Approximately 80% of Darling's North American fats, including poultry fat, flow to DGD for conversion into renewable fuels. Carter noted one unique challenge: ""Poultry fat tends to have some higher impurities than we can handle at the facility. So you could never run 100% poultry fat. But we are able to run poultry fat in the facility at DGD and we do.""

Implications for poultry producers

When asked whether any producers were raising poultry specifically for waste products, Backman-Flamerich emphasized that current SAF production relies entirely on byproducts from food production, avoiding food-versus-fuel conflicts.

He added: ""Until we reach some level of maxing out of HEFA, which is in the tens of billions of gallons, I don't think we're going to be there yet.""

Carter emphasized the supply chain integration benefits: ""It's bringing just that much more of a supply chain integration and being able for us to grow in that space to help customers realize the decarbonization goals that they have.""

The collaboration between poultry production, rendering and aviation illustrates how waste streams from one industry can become premium feedstocks for another — creating economic value while advancing climate goals across sectors. As Backman-Flamerich concluded: ""None of these three pillars happen without engagement from the entire aviation value chain, which includes everyone in this room.""",https://img.wattagnet.com/mindful/watt/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/12/united-airlines.4esEF0U1eV.avif?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-12-31 12:12:06.640502

“There wasn’t specific discussion about uranium or fracking, or even the fact that (natural resource development) would be the headline push of the second mandate,” Urbaniak said.
Because it is an issue that is polarizing,” Turnbull said, adding that she can’t speculate on when Houston decided he would make a push for natural resource development.
Environmental advocates, meanwhile, have said they worry about the potential environmental and health risks tied to fracking and uranium mining.
When asked about these concerns, Klimek said, “Premier Houston is a Nova Scotian first.","HALIFAX — In the year since the Nova Scotia Progressive Conservatives under Premier Tim Houston won a resounding second mandate, the government’s focus has largely been on a topic that didn’t get much attention during the 2024 election campaign.

Houston’s Tories have lifted a moratorium on fracking and a ban on uranium mining, and opened calls for offshore oil and gas exploration bids. They’ve introduced measures to streamline both the environmental assessments for energy projects and the permitting processes for mining. And the premier laid out plans for a massive offshore wind energy development.

To top it off, in October, Houston named himself energy minister.

Political science experts say that had Houston given voters details about his energy ideas, the November election campaign — after which the Progressive Conservatives won 43 out of 55 seats — may have looked different.

“If there had been more details about critical minerals, what that means for private property potentially, that would have been the dominant discussion in the election campaign,” Tom Urbaniak, a political scientist at Cape Breton University, said in an interview Tuesday.

“There wasn’t specific discussion about uranium or fracking, or even the fact that (natural resource development) would be the headline push of the second mandate,” Urbaniak said.

Instead, the Progressive Conservative campaign focused on lowering some taxes, raising the minimum wage, and hiring more doctors to support the health system. Much of those promises have been fulfilled. The Department of Health says there are 453 more physicians working in Nova Scotia now than in 2021 when the Progressive Conservatives were first elected. The department was not immediately able to provide the number of new doctors hired since the November 2024 election.

To address affordability, the premier pledged to “ensure power-rate fairness” by capping increases to the Canadian average, which has not yet happened. The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a question about progress toward implementing the promised cap.

Lori Turnbull, a political scientist with Dalhousie University, said Tuesday that political parties never do exactly what they include in campaign materials, because unpredictable challenges arise once they enter office.

“But I think the question is, did you intentionally not tell us because you knew it would be controversial, and you didn’t want the campaign to be taken over by something like this? Because it is an issue that is polarizing,” Turnbull said, adding that she can’t speculate on when Houston decided he would make a push for natural resource development.

“If you start talking about the possibility of fracking, possibility of opening up uranium mines, and all of the environmental and health risks that go along with that, that’s the type of thing that, even though it might not be anyone’s Number 1 issue … these other things can become the split issue in the campaign,” she said.

On the campaign trail, the premier did not hold a stand-alone press conference to highlight his natural resources plans, as he did with many election promises. The campaign material said, “the path to future economic prosperity must include a refocusing back to our natural resources.” It made note of critical mineral potential, without specifics, and said efforts will be made to develop sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen.

When asked why natural resource development was not emphasized as a key issue on the campaign trail, a spokesperson for the premier said Houston made it clear to voters he would be focused on growing the economy.

“Then (U.S.) President Trump launched a tariff war against Canada. That made it even clearer we must be more self-sufficient — at a time when a new prime minister is pushing Canada to be an energy superpower and our deficit remains a reality. So we acted,” said Catherine Klimek.

There has been criticism over Houston’s speedy push for mining and natural resource development, with the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi’kmaw Chiefs raising concerns in June about government failing to consult with them before the province issued a request for exploration proposals for three sites with known deposits of uranium in. No companies came forward with a bid.

Environmental advocates, meanwhile, have said they worry about the potential environmental and health risks tied to fracking and uranium mining.

When asked about these concerns, Klimek said, “Premier Houston is a Nova Scotian first. He would never put our province at risk. Technology has evolved, and today resource development is governed by rigorous, modern safeguards.”

On Dec. 22, the government said it was putting Dalhousie University in charge of a $30-million program that will see a call for onshore natural-gas exploration in the new year. Officials said new natural-gas development will allow the province to cut back on burning coal for electricity generation and help it hit its 2030 emission targets.

However, a former university president who oversaw the report that led to a decade-long ban on fracking in Nova Scotia has questioned the government’s claims that natural gas would lower emissions and energy prices.

Global SAF supply remains low, with industry projections still below the 1% target for total jet fuel consumption.

Airlines like Delta and United are advancing SAF usage at individual hubs, but global integration remains slow due to the high cost and limited production.

However, Airbus’s “ZEROe” hydrogen aircraft program is seen as the future, as it moves towards fuel-cell technology to replace traditional combustion methods by 2040. Despite a 10-year delay in the entry into service timeline, the company’s success in hydrogen-powered aircraft testing brings hope for a sustainable future in aviation.

Conclusion:

The 2025 sustainability milestones achieved by TUI and major airlines like Jet2, Delta, Vietjet, and Lufthansa signal a promising future for the aviation and tourism industries. These companies are leading the way with innovative sustainability solutions, including SAF adoption, fleet modernization, and operational efficiencies. However, challenges remain, particularly with the supply of SAF and the infrastructure needed for hydrogen-powered aircraft.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/160703_TUI_cam_05_03_Freigabe_2000px.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 13:56:36.395379

It is either the Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 families. Both have reshaped global aviation profoundly. But today, we are going to talk about the newest Airbus A320neo family. From major hub-to-hub routes to thin regional services, the A320neo has become one of the most recognizable and widely deployed aircraft types in the world. We will explore why the A320neo family has achieved such extraordinary global penetration, examining the technical, operational, and economic forces behind its success.

Since entering service in 2016, the A320neo family has built on the legacy of the original and successful A320 series, which itself revolutionized short- and medium-haul flying. With improved engines, advanced aerodynamics, and cockpit commonality, the A320neo has become a cornerstone of airlines' fleets of every size on every continent of our planet. Understanding why it is everywhere today means looking at how Airbus future-proofed the platform for a rapidly evolving aviation market.

Designing For Scale: How Airbus Built A Global Narrowbody Platform

At the heart of the A320neo family’s global presence is the sheer scale and flexibility of the program. Airbus designed the NEO (New Engine Option) as an evolutionary upgrade rather than a clean-sheet aircraft, allowing airlines to adopt it with minimal disruption. This approach enabled faster certification, quicker airline adoption, a smoother pilot transition, and immediate operational benefits.

The A320neo family includes the A319neo, A320neo, and A321neo, covering a wide range of capacities and mission profiles. According to Airbus, the family delivers at least a 20% reduction in fuel burn and CO₂ emissions compared to previous-generation aircraft, driven mainly by new-generation engines and aerodynamic improvements such as sharklets. These gains translate directly into lower operating costs, a critical factor for airlines operating in competitive short-haul markets. Additionally, the combination of a range up to 4,000 miles and efficiency has made the aircraft attractive not only to full-service carriers but also to low-cost operators and leasing companies worldwide.

But it’s important to mention that the NEO’s success is inseparable from the legacy of the original A320ceo. First introduced in the late 1980s, the A320 was the world’s first commercial jet to feature a full digital fly-by-wire system, setting a new standard for cockpit automation. Over more than three decades, Airbus delivered over 12,000 A320ceo-family aircraft across the A318, A319, A320, and A321 variants, creating one of the largest installed bases in aviation history. This enormous global footprint meant that when the NEO was launched, airlines already trusted the platform, accelerating adoption and reinforcing Airbus’ narrowbody dominance.

Next-Generation Engines & Environmental Performance

One of the most decisive factors behind the A320neo’s global reach is its engine technology. Airbus gave customers a choice between two advanced powerplants: the CFM LEAP-1A and the Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-JM geared turbofan. This dual-engine strategy reduced risk for airlines and broadened the aircraft’s appeal.

Both engines promise double-digit improvements in fuel efficiency, along with lower noise footprints and reduced maintenance costs over the aircraft’s life cycle. The geared turbofan concept, in particular, introduced a new paradigm in narrowbody propulsion by allowing the fan and low-pressure turbine to operate at optimal speeds. These innovations are frequently highlighted by engineers and pilots in operational videos and technical explainers, which often discuss the aircraft’s performance and efficiency.

Beyond fuel burn, the engines support airlines’ environmental commitments. Airbus emphasizes that the A320neo family is already certified to operate with up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with a roadmap toward 100% SAF capability by 2030. This future-proofing has reassured airlines planning fleets in an increasingly regulation-driven environment.

Engine choice has always been central to the A320 program’s evolution. Earlier A320ceo variants relied on CFM56 and IAE V2500 engines, both of which proved exceptionally reliable and contributed to the type’s strong dispatch performance. By offering a similar dual-choice with the NEO, this time, either LEAP-1A or PW1100G, Airbus deliberately echoed this strategy, giving airlines continuity while introducing step-change efficiency improvements. This parallel between CEO and NEO generations has helped airlines transition fleets gradually rather than through disruptive wholesale replacement.

Cockpit Commonality & Airline Operational Economics

Another pillar of the A320neo family’s success is cockpit and operational commonality. Airbus deliberately preserved the A320 family flight deck philosophy, ensuring that pilots can transition between variants with minimal additional training. This commonality has powerful implications for airline economics.

Pilots qualified on the A320ceo can move to the NEO with adjustment training rather than full type certification, significantly reducing training costs. Maintenance crews benefit from similar efficiencies, as many systems and procedures remain unchanged. This continuity has been repeatedly emphasized in industry discussions and pilot-focused video content, analyzing why airlines favor Airbus narrowbodies.

For large operators running hundreds of aircraft, these savings scale rapidly. Fleet flexibility also improves resilience, allowing airlines to swap aircraft between routes and bases without complex retraining programs. This operational simplicity has been a key driver of the A320neo’s rapid adoption across continents.

This philosophy dates back to the earliest days of the A320ceo family. Airbus designed the A319, A320, and the stretched A321 to share a common type rating, allowing airlines to tailor capacity without fragmenting pilot pools. The NEO family preserves this approach, meaning a pilot can fly an A319neo on a short regional sector one day and an A321neo on a high-density or long-range route the next. Furthermore, this commonality goes beyond the A320 family. According to Airbus, pilots with an A320 type rating can transition to larger cousins such as the A330 and A350, in as little as one week to ten days of additional training! This seamless scalability remains one of the A320 family’s most underappreciated competitive advantages.

Production Scale, Availability, & Worldwide Visibility

While efficiency and commonality matter, availability and production scale are equally crucial to global presence. Airbus has invested heavily in expanding A320neo production capacity to meet unprecedented demand. This industrial strategy has helped cement the aircraft’s dominance.

The A320neo family is assembled in multiple final assembly lines across Europe, Asia, and North America. This geographically distributed production model reduces delivery risk and brings Airbus closer to key customers. According to industry tracking and Flightradar24's analysis, the A320neo is now one of the most frequently observed aircraft types in global airspace, reflecting both high delivery volumes and intense daily utilization.

Airbus’ massive order backlog further reinforces the type’s visibility. Thousands of A320neo-family aircraft are on order with airlines and lessors, ensuring that the type will remain a dominant feature of global fleets well into the 2030s.

But this impressive production scale did not emerge overnight. The A320ceo program steadily ramped up output through the 1990s and 2000s as demand surged from Europe and North America, and later from Asia-Pacific. By the time the NEO entered service, Airbus already had decades of narrowbody manufacturing experience and a mature global supply chain. This continuity allowed the manufacturer to transition from CEO to NEO production without the severe bottlenecks often associated with all-new aircraft programs.

Why The A321neo Became The Family’s Standout Variant

A common question is why the A321neo, in particular, has become so prominent within the family. The answer lies in its ability to blur the line between traditional narrowbodies and widebodies. For many airlines, the long-range XLR variant has replaced larger aircraft on certain routes.

Airbus has extended the narrowbody concept to the long-haul market with variants such as the A321LR and A321XLR. These aircraft can operate transatlantic and other long-range routes with lower trip costs than widebodies, opening new city pairs. Airlines and analysts frequently cite this capability as a strategic game-changer, a topic often discussed on social media and in technical forums.

This flexibility has driven strong demand from both legacy carriers and low-cost airlines seeking growth without the financial risk of widebody fleets. As a result, the A321neo has become one of the fastest-selling aircraft in Airbus’ history, further expanding the family’s global presence.

The A321 itself has an important lineage within the family. Introduced as a higher-capacity derivative of the original A320, it allowed Airbus to challenge larger narrowbodies and even some short-haul widebodies. The NEO generation has further elevated this concept, while the A319 and A320 continue to serve as right-sized solutions for lower-demand markets. Together, these subvariants allow airlines to fine-tune capacity while maintaining fleet commonality. This is an approach few competitors have matched at a similar scale.

The A320neo Family’s Long-Term Role In Global Aviation

Looking ahead, the A320neo family’s global presence is likely to grow even further as airlines focus on sustainability, efficiency, and network flexibility. Airbus continues to refine the platform with incremental upgrades and digital enhancements. These improvements ensure the aircraft remains competitive against both current and future rivals.

For airlines, the A320neo represents a low-risk, high-reward investment that aligns with modern operational and environmental priorities. For passengers, it offers quieter cabins, improved comfort, and access to more direct routes. These combined benefits help explain why the aircraft is now virtually everywhere.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/global-3.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-31 12:12:17.479940

China's National Energy Administration recently released its five-year plan, which included ways for provinces to use excess renewable energy. During peak production, renewable sources like wind and solar can sometimes produce more electricity than the grid can handle.

Outputs like green hydrogen generation can put that excess power to good use. The National Energy Administration's plan also pointed to green ammonia, green methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel as other uses for surplus renewable energy. Like green hydrogen, they can also be used to cut transportation pollution.

China has already started building production facilities that tightly link renewable energy with hydrogen. Meanwhile, Chinese researchers have been able to tap into water vapor as a green hydrogen source.

Burning coal, oil, and gas are the biggest sources of atmospheric pollution, but hydrogen's sustainability depends entirely on how it's made. Hydrogen needs energy to be separated from water. If that energy comes from fossil fuel sources, the resulting hydrogen embodies that pollution, even if using hydrogen doesn't directly produce harmful by-products.

China is the world's largest polluter, thanks in no small part to its reliance on coal power. However, it has also deployed the most solar energy in the world. It's no slouch when it comes to wind power, either. The more it can reliably transition to green energy sources, the sooner it can replace dirty power like coal.

Grid-scale energy emissions are contributing to atmospheric pollution, which exacerbates destructive weather patterns and affects China directly. The country has weathered increasingly severe floods, droughts, and storms like many others, and borne the costs that go with them.

The company says it now operates more than 150 heavy-duty Class 8 electric vehicles across the continent, plans to add more semis in 2026 as Tesla begins its volume production.

Stephan Schablinski, vice president of GoGreen North America at DHL Supply Chain, told Transport Topics that more deliveries are expected to begin from next year’s second half onward. Schablinski said DHL wants to operate the Semi tractors in other states beyond California, including Ohio and Pennsylvania.

According to the company, 30 percent of DHL’s medium- and heavy-duty trucking fleet is expected to be battery-electric or powered by another zero-emissions technology by 2030.

The Tesla Semi pilot took place in Livermore, Calif. over two weeks in October 2026, where the all-electric truck covered over 3,000 miles of regular routes. The trial included one long haul of 390 miles, and was fully loaded with a gross combined weight of 75,000 pounds.

“Our pilot of the Tesla Semi exceeded expectations, proving its ability to efficiently haul a typical DHL freight over long distances on a single charge,” said Jim Monkmeyer, president of transportation, DHL Supply Chain North America, in a statement. “Integrating the Tesla Semi into our fleet is an important step toward achieving our decarbonization goals and delivering more sustainable solutions for our customers.”

According to Tesla, the Semi can travel up to 500 miles on a single charge, and can recover up to 70 percent of range in 30 minutes. Class 8 trucks typically have a range of less than 250 miles on one charge.

Dan Priestley, director of Semi at Tesla, said the DHL partnership will “help us make the product even better for future global markets.” Tesla says the start of serial production of the Semi remains on schedule for late 2025 with a ramp up to capacity in 2026.

The truck currently travels approximately 100 miles per day in central California, DHL says, and requires charging about once per week. Additionally, it is projected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 metric tons annually.

With the Tesla Semi within its fleet, DHL can further accelerate its transition to net zero-emission logistics, a call the logistics giant aims to reach by 2050. On a shorter-term basis, the company is also pushing to reduce absolute carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from 40 million metric tons to 29 million in 2030 to stay aligned with Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) requirements.

Tesla is one of multiple companies that DHL has worked with for electric trucking adoption since 2020, with the company teaming up with BYD, Volvo Trucks, Daimler Truck, Scania and now-defunct Nikola on separate deployments. DHL Supply Chain also owns and operates more than 50 Orange EV yard trucks that are deployed at 30 sites across the country to move trailers and shipping containers.

The Livermore facility does not have any other battery-electric trucks other than the Tesla Semi, according to Schablinski.

Beyond the long haul, EVs have been a priority for DHL’s wider last-mile delivery ambitions.

As of October, DHL said it has 39,000 total EVs worldwide in pickup and delivery services, representing more than 41 percent of pickup and delivery vehicles. The company aims to increase this share to 66 percent in 2030.

Decarbonization at the logistics giant also extends to its air cargo operation, which accounts for 68 percent of DHL’s emissions. DHL has already used 188,000 metric tons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) between 2020 and 2024 and will double that figure this year. SAF now makes up 3.5 percent of the company’s total jet fuel mix, with the firm aiming to escalate this number to 30 percent by 2030.

DHL’s sustainability push recently pushed into ocean freight. This month, DHL partnered with ocean carrier CMA CGM to decarbonize container shipping, with the logistics companies committing to use 8,900 metric tons of a lower-carbon biofuel for ocean shipments.

Under that initiative, DHL and CMA CGM expect to slash roughly 25,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for ocean freight shipped through DHL’s GoGreen Plus and CMA CGM’s ACT+ programs.

Those programs are designed to let customers pay a premium price to select more sustainable fuel options for their shipments.

Finding solutions to decarbonize aviation is one of the most pressing issues scientists currently face. Ammonia (NH3) has the potential to be a powerful tool towards solving this, given its lack of CO2 emissions when used in place of conventional jet fuel. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of ammonia with an additional assessment of Sustainable Aviation Fuels, hydrogen fuel, and all-electric battery systems based on emissions, ease of integration, and technological limitations.Evaluation of these three other power sources serves to provide a baseline of comparison, as these three are some of the most well-studied options and ammonia is less well-studied. Data was analyzed from both experimental and theoretical research across multiple disciplines to synthesize our findings. We find that pure ammonia is not ideal for direct combustion due to extremely low flame speed and high ignition delay time, and using ammonia as a hydrogen carrier either through cracking or two-stage combustion is undesirable due to high costs of implementation. Ultimately, we recommend further experimental study on the use of ammonia as an additive to fuel blends containing kerosene and hydrogen, as this is the most promising solution under the parameters previously established.

Introduction

Climate change has become one of the largest threats currently facing humanity. As such, much time and effort has been devoted to discovering novel ways to decarbonize our modern society, including aviation . We increasingly rely on aviation to connect with the world, and thus finding a solution to make aviation more sustainable is necessary to meet global climate goals . Fortunately, many strides have already been made in terms of decreasing the energy intensity per passenger-mile of air travel through various improvements in technology, leading to the energy intensity of air travel decreasing by 77% per passenger in two decades. This great improvement cannot fully account for the increasing demand for air travel that we have especially seen in the past decade, as overall emissions from air travel still increased by 30% from 2013 to 2019 alone . This indicates a troubling trend in the commercial aviation industry. While commercial air travel only accounted for 2.5% of global emissions in 2022, this is expected to rise to 11% in the next two decades if significant advances in technology are not made to account for rising demand . It is important to understand that “emissions” encompasses not only the classic CO2, but also other carbon emissions like CO, and nitrous oxides (NOx). NOx emissions can decrease crop yields, cause diseases in humans, and exacerbate the Greenhouse Gas effect by creating ozone, thus perpetuating climate change‘ . Thus, to prevent the environmental and economic disadvantages of rising emissions, it is clear that we must invest more into the discovery and development of novel sustainable aviation technologies.

To support this goal, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which is a trade association representing a large portion of air travel, has set a goal for aviation emissions to reach 50% of their 2005 level by 2050 . To achieve this, large investments into every sector of aviation will be required, but one of the most crucial is the fuel being used. While many alternatives such as Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) and hydrogen (H2) have been considered and extensively studied, some recent research has begun to focus on ammonia (NH3) as a possible fuel option due to its possible fuel option due to its potentially low carbon emissions . While SAFs and hydrogen have received substantial attention, ammonia is increasingly discussed due to its potential for carbon-free combustion and simpler airplane storage needs than hydrogen due to its higher freezing temperature and narrower flammability range‘ . Furthermore, recent increased interest in ammonia may be explained by its production on an industrial scale for over a century as a fertilizer and refrigerant, making it easily accessible . It also is roughly 17.8% of hydrogen by mass, meaning that many of hydrogen’s benefits could be accessed by utilizing the more convenient-to-store and -produce ammonia instead .

This paper is a systematic review synthesizing data from papers published from 2017 to 2025 to provide a comparative analysis of alternative aviation fuels and evaluate ammonia’s technical viability. The primary limitation of this paper is that no experimental research facilities were accessible, so all findings are based on the experimental work of other researchers. The focus of this article is to review some processes related to fuel combustion (if applicable) and emissions (both carbon dioxide and NOx) with a specific focus on the alternative aviation fuels described previously (SAFs, hydrogen, and all-electric battery). No other paper reviewed by the authors included both an analysis of ammonia as well as analyses of SAFs, hydrogen, and all-electric battery systems, making this paper unique in its method of evaluating the effectiveness of ammonia. The intent of this analysis is to inform policymakers and researchers as to what some of the most promising lines of inquiry are in the field of sustainable aviation. We do not attempt to comprehensively review the entire field of alternative aviation fuel, as this is a continuously evolving area of research. The first section of this paper serves as an overview of ammonia and sustainable aviation goals. The next section outlines the methodology used in the creation of this paper, followed by an extensive comparison of all four considered fuels (SAFs, hydrogen, all-electric battery, and ammonia) concluding with an evaluation of current research prospects in the fourth section. Finally, the fifth section presents the conclusions of the paper along with research recommendations.

Methodology

For this research paper, a systematic literature review was conducted to gain a holistic view of the most current work being done in the field of sustainable jet fuels, with the data collection period beginning in June 2025 and ending in September 2025. The general methodology followed is displayed in Figure 1. Search engines like Google Scholar and JSTOR were used to find papers, first using keywords like “sustainable aviation fuels”, “hydrogen as jet fuel”, and“alternative jet fuels” to build a comprehensive view of existing literature in the field. Google Scholar was generally preferred over JSTOR due to having more primary sources related to aviation than JSTOR when the same keywords were used. Then, keywords such as “ammonia as jet fuel” and “ammonia combustion properties” were used to gain a thorough understanding of the ammonia niche. Paper relevancy was assessed first by publishing date, as all papers older than 2023 were prioritized due to being the most up to date information, but some older sources were used when no more recent papers were available or when appropriate for the subject. Then, papers were thoroughly reviewed to ensure their findings were relevant to the topic of this paper by scanning the titles of papers, looking for connections to aviation. Source credibility was assessed by verifying publication integrity, with peer-reviewed academic journals, conference papers, and credible books being preferred above all else whenever possible. Finally, research design of the paper was considered, as experimental research was prioritized, but non-experimental papers were not always excluded. Numerical findings from research papers were extracted through thorough analysis of the papers and digital note-taking, making special note of papers that contained experimental findings about combustion properties.

Ultimately, 29 sources were determined to meet these requirements, most of which were research papers published in academic journals. All sources were evaluated to ensure no duplicates appeared. Any sources not coming from academic journals were instead from other reputable sources, such as government websites, and were largely not used for critical information. Main takeaways were synthesized and numerical findings were compared from differing sources to provide a basis for this paper’s discussion.

Results

Background

In order to fully understand ammonia as an alternative fuel, it is first important to understand other alternative fuel solutions that have been proposed. The aim of this section is to provide an overview of three of the main areas of research other than ammonia (Sustainable Aviation Fuels, hydrogen, and electric) and evaluate their advantages and disadvantages in relation to the metrics previously described (emissions, ease of integration, and technological limitations). Since this paper deals with the field of combustion, the following key properties are considered to compare combustion properties: 1) Flame speed, or the speed at which a flame propagates through a fluid. 2) Ignition Delay Time (IDT), or the time interval between the start of fuel injection and combustion. Both of these properties heavily influence engine design, particularly the fuel injection systems and combustor geometry. However, an important distinction between them is that while IDT decreases with temperature, flame speed increases‘ . The typical parameter ranges within which aircraft engines operate is described in Table 1 below. While these conditions may not be the exact same as those later reported in the paper, later reported work still reflects the general trends for combustion of the discussed fuels (if relevant) .

Table 1 | Typical Aircraft Engine Parameter Ranges

Sustainable Aviation Fuels

Sustainable Aviation Fuels encompass a wide range of fuels that are united by their production methods: they are typically made using waste products or other biological products such as leftover cooking oil or animal fats‘ . This pivot away from using petroleum-based fuels leaves ample room for life-cycle carbon emission savings despite similar combustion to conventional jet fuel, with some finding an up to 90% reduction in overall emissions . However, some other cradle to grave analyses, which includes all emissions involved in the transportation, production, and combustion of SAFs, have found emission reductions as low as 27% . Nonetheless, some non-trivial emission reduction is essentially guaranteed for aircraft operating on SAFs. It is also crucial to note that SAFs are entirely drop-in compatible, since they are chemically engineered to have similar combustion properties (including flame speed and IDT) to conventional jet fuels . Since SAFs have such similar combustion properties to conventional jet fuels, while their specific chemical compositions may vary, they will generally follow the general combustion equation of a hydrocarbon (shown above) . However, this does again emphasize that this approach is not free from carbon emissions. This is a substantial advantage, as it means that essentially no engine redesigns are required to begin utilizing SAFs, minimizing downtime of aircraft and costs associated with creating new engines. Thus, SAFs work remarkably well within our current technological limitations.

However, the primary roadblock to widespread SAF adoption currently is high price, as SAFs can cost between 120-700% more than conventional jet fuels .This would make a transition to utilizing SAFs incredibly taxing on commercial airlines financially, and the effect is only worsened by the lack of producer incentives currently in place . Currently, SAF production is operating at only 3.5% of its total potential capacity, largely due to policies around the world not incentivizing growth within the market . Thus, although SAFs offer substantial savings on emissions and work within our technological limitations, the financial cost of integrating them today is simply too high for airlines to cover, and substantial policy reform is needed to encourage growth to meet potentially rising demand.

Hydrogen

Hydrogen is widely renowned for having nearly zero carbon emissions in combustion, as its combustion equation only directly produces water (although some NOx emissions may result as an indirect byproduct of combustion) . It is also roughly 3x as gravimetrically energy dense as conventional jet fuel, meaning that every 1 kg of hydrogen has 3x the energy as 1 kg of jet fuel . Although direct life-cycle evaluations of hydrogen as a jet fuel are lacking, an analysis on the potential saving of hydrogen in automobiles found a potential 15-45% decrease in lifetime emissions .This is not a direct parallel to emission savings that could be seen if implemented in aviation, as automobiles and aircraft operate under very different conditions, but it nonetheless indicates a relatively substantial decrease in emissions that would likely apply to aviation as well.

The fact that hydrogen does not guarantee a 100% decrease in emissions is in large part due to its production process. Although hydrogen can be produced sustainably through water electrolysis, a process in which electricity is used to split water into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2), only 0.1% of hydrogen is currently produced in this manner due to prohibitively high costs, and it relies on availability of green energy on the grid to be fully carbon neutral . Carbon capture technology, which substantially reduces the emissions of production processes, are only being used in 0.6% of hydrogen production . The other 99.3% of hydrogen being produced utilizes either oil or natural gases to fuel methane (CH4) reforming, which also releases methane as a waste product with up to 120x the heating power of CO2‘ . This has led to the production of hydrogen being responsible for roughly 2% of current annual CO2 emissions .

Furthermore, hydrogen poses many challenges in terms of storage and usage on aircraft, since it is only 25% as volumetrically energy dense as conventional jet fuel and requires incredibly cold, high pressure storage tanks . This means that space would have to be made on the aircraft for tanks that are much larger and require much more pressurization and cooling than the tanks currently in use, necessitating a fundamental redesign of the aircraft. Unfortunately, this redesign will also have to reach the engines, as hydrogen has nearly eight times the flame speed of and much lower IDT than conventional jet fuel, meaning that it is not drop-in compatible‘ . Much research has been dedicated to solving for these differences, though, and there are some prototype designs that could theoretically utilize hydrogen .

In sum, in terms of emissions, unsustainable hydrogen production makes hydrogen undesirable. In terms of ease of integration, more work is needed in terms of redesigning all aircraft fundamentally and getting hydrogen to every airport, making hydrogen undesirable. Finally, in terms of technological limitations, the challenges posed by hydrogen storage currently make widespread usage unlikely.

All-Electric

The field of electrically propelled aircraft encompasses not only aircraft relying entirely on electricity for propulsion (all-electric), but also hybrid aircraft that rely both on conventional jet fuel and batteries . This section primarily focuses on all-electric aircraft, since these present the most exciting change in comparison to today’s aircraft. Such an aircraft would have very minimal if any emissions when implemented in the aircraft, with the only life-cycle emissions coming from battery production-related emissions. These emissions are still relatively low, though, as one analysis found that business carriers could see a 93% reduction in emissions if they were made all-electric . This is the most dramatic emission reduction discussed thus far, but unfortunately, all-electric aircraft fall short in other ways.

All-electric aircraft would rely on batteries storing huge amounts of energy to maintain power during the flight, but current battery technology is simply not advanced enough to accommodate this. Even the most efficient batteries today would have to be prohibitively large and heavy in order to store enough energy for a single flight, with weight increasing with the length of the flight . This would cause all-electric aircraft to have slower flight times and shorter ranges than today’s aircraft, hugely hampering their potential to be a full solution as not all routes could be served‘‘ . One analysis found that even in an optimistic case where it would be possible to produce all-electric aircraft capable of traveling up to 500 km per flight, this would only affect 5% of all commercial aircraft energy usage . Thus, 95% of the energy used by commercial aviation would still be contributing to climate change, and the previously stated emission reductions are severely hampered in scale. Furthermore, the colossal size of batteries needed to support commercial aviation would also cause 92% of commercially used aircraft to be unable to take off due to excessive battery weight . All-electric propulsion is also entirely not drop-in compatible, as it would require a fundamental redesign of the aircraft to accommodate the new batteries . This means that no currently used aircraft could continue to be used without substantial modification, incurring extra downtime of aircraft and costs related to heavily modifying and redesigning aircraft.

In all, while having the potential for incredible emission reductions, all-electric propulsion fundamentally fails to make a significant impact due to its cumbersome implementation and need for technology that simply does not exist yet. Until serious advances in battery efficiency are achieved, further research in other fields or in hybrid-electric models is recommended.

Ammonia

The balanced equation for the combustion of ammonia and air (shown above) shares many features with that of hydrogen and air, including a lack of carbon outputs. However, it notably includes some N2 as an output, which sets it apart from hydrogen and introduces new considerations for combustion and emissions which will be further discussed in this section. While still requiring more complex storage than conventional fuel, one of the primary advantages of ammonia is that it has much less stringent storage requirements than hydrogen. Ammonia has a boiling temperature of -33 ℃ at 1 atm, compared to hydrogen’s -253 ℃, meaning that it would require less investment into cryogenic tanks . This makes ammonia a seemingly ideal substitute, as it significantly mitigates one of the primary design challenges associated with use of hydrogen. It is still somewhat more complex to store than conventional jet fuels, though, which are liquid at room temperature and typically have freezing temperatures around -50 ℃, with some fluctuation depending on exact fuel composition .Thus, much recent research in the field of sustainable aviation has focused on the utilization of ammonia as a jet fuel through several different methods. This section discusses and evaluates the use of ammonia as jet fuel (pure ammonia use), using ammonia as a hydrogen carrier (typically through cracking or complex combustion), and the use of ammonia as an additive to other fuel types.

Pure Ammonia Use

Using ammonia on its own may seem like the most simple solution, as it would ideally serve as a direct replacement for jet fuel while circumventing the challenges associated with hydrogen. Unfortunately, ammonia causes many new issues to arise that hydrogen does not suffer from. While hydrogen has a relatively high flame speed and low IDT, ammonia has the opposite problem of having a low flame speed and high IDT‘‘‘ . Table 2 displays the flame speed of several mixtures, notably showing that by replacing just half of a hydrogen mixture with ammonia, the flame speed is decreased almost sevenfold . The flame speed for an ammonia/air mixture, though, was not determined at these exact conditions by any work reviewed for this paper. However, at P = 5 bar, T = 500 K, and Φ = 1, the flame speed of ammonia-air has been experimentally determined to be roughly 0.11 m/s, far below any other flame speed presented despite being at a higher pressure . Clees et al. attempted to validate some of the foremost models for predicting IDT through shock tube experiments and OH* and OH measurements, as the presence of these indicate ignition in the fuel, finding that most models are unable to accurately predict the IDT of ammonia at all temperatures .

Table 2 | Comparison of Flame Speeds at P = 2 bar, T = 600 K, and Φ = 1 .

This essentially means that while hydrogen presents challenges due to being too readily combustible, ammonia is instead too difficult to combust. The primary consequence of this is that pure ammonia mixtures would be incompatible with current aviation engines, as the combustor geometry is simply not suited for efficiently combusting fuels with these properties due to combustion possibly occurring too late . Furthermore, analyses have even found potential for ammonia in current engines not fully combusting before leaving the engine due to these differences in combustion properties, thereby releasing more unburnt ammonia, NOx, and other harmful emissions into the environment . Therefore, due to the massive engine redesign that would be required and potential for harmful emissions, using pure ammonia on its own as a fuel is not recommended.

Alternative Ammonia Combustion

The potential of ammonia due to its previously discussed advantages over hydrogen has spurred further research into novel uses of ammonia. Specifically, some research groups have examined the possibility of using ammonia as a hydrogen carrier in order to avoid the downsides of ammonia while still enjoying its benefits. One such approach is called ammonia cracking, which involves the splitting of ammonia into nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen prior to reaching the combustor‘ . This approach has the added benefit of utilizing waste heat from the engine to fuel the cracking process, thereby increasing overall system efficiency . Furthermore, due to the increased presence of stable nitrogen and hydrogen, which are much less likely to form NOx emissions than ammonia on its own, NOx emissions have been predicted to decrease in planes using this approach . Implementation of this design would require the addition of a cracking chamber to each engine, as well as redesigns to accommodate the combustion of hydrogen, but hypothetical models have been made that fit these requirements . The largest barriers this approach faces are the inherent inconvenience of having to entirely redesign all existing engines, the added weight of cracking systems, and the novelty of this idea, as it has never been implemented on a commercial scale before. Thus, significant investment into experimental research is recommended before implementation of this approach.

A second approach being considered is the splitting of ammonia into hydrogen and nitrogen through two-stage combustion. This means that there will first be a fuel rich zone, with high concentration of ammonia to begin conversion to hydrogen, followed by a fuel lean zone, with a high concentration of air to complete conversion, as seen in Figure 2 .

Again, a main advantage of this approach is a significant decrease in NOx emissions at aircraft engine conditions due to increased N2 presence . However, most previous examples of two-stage ammonia emissions incorporate the use of a pilot or start-up fuel to compensate for ammonia’s unfavorable combustion properties, such as methane‘ . This once again reintroduces carbon into the combustor, although generally additions of CH4 have been shown to reduce emissions on net because of increased combustion efficiency . While this approach would not require the addition of a whole new cracking chamber, it would still require significant combustor redesign and fuel mixing techniques that have yet to be achieved on a practical level in the aviation industry. Furthermore, recently published studies have found that while novel combustion techniques like multi-stage combustion do generally lead to reductions in NOx emissions, the most effective approach to mitigating NOx emissions is to have the equivalence ratio be greater than 1, which has not yet been tested for either cracking or multistage combustion . Thus, this approach is not yet feasible due to a lack of experimental research.

Ammonia as an Additive

While both of the previous techniques are limited by their reliance on unproven engine redesigns, the most promising line of ammonia research in terms of near-term feasibility currently ongoing relies on assuming none of these major changes. Specifically, Alabaş suggests using ammonia as an additive, either to hydrogen, kerosene, or both . The central study pushing forward this alternative was conducted using over 1600 iterations in ANSYS Fluent using the SIMPLE algorithm . Specific model parameters can be seen in Table 3 below. Authors modeled a GTM-120 mini gas turbine engine, which is a typical research tool for studying the behavior of airplane engines . Thus, all results are assuming no or minimal changes to current engine designs.

Table 3 | Model Parameters Used to Evaluate Ammonia as an Additive

Several mixtures were tested with concentrations of ammonia ranging from 5% to 45%, kerosene limited to 50%, and hydrogen making up the difference . It is important to note that while the addition of kerosene generally improved combustion efficiency, it had the significant tradeoff of introducing carbon to the mixture, thus producing carbon emissions . In terms of ammonia, the study found that while NOx emissions peaked at 5% ammonia, they then decreased rather significantly after that point as the concentration of ammonia increased, likely due to decreased flame temperatures . Ultimately, the ideal mixture the study recommends is 50% kerosene, 45% ammonia, and 5% hydrogen because of its lowered NOx emissions and overall burn efficiency . This increase in burn efficiency is reflected in a decrease in CO emissions, which result as a byproduct of incomplete combustion, and the massive difference in this can be seen in Table 4 .

Table 4 | Ammonia Mixture Emissions Comparison .

While this is not an ideal solution due to the inclusion of kerosene, a hydrocarbon, this still provides greatly lowered emissions compared to conventional jet fuel while still preserving drop-in compatibility . Thus, because of the significant technological and logistical barriers that come with implementing all other proposed solutions, using ammonia as an additive is likely the most technologically feasible solution at this time. While notable emissions reductions are still achieved, the largest barrier to decarbonizing aviation is circumvented: difficulties within implementation. However, this study did not take into consideration the storage of the fuel mixture, which is a substantial oversight since (as previously discussed) storing both ammonia and hydrogen comes with unique challenges that could potentially complicate implementation. There is no explanation of how the blend will be kept at a temperature and/or pressure suitable for all involved fuels, which is alarming due to the vastly different storage requirements they have (see section Ammonia). There is also a notable lack of experimental confirmation of the simulation’s findings. Thus, while this approach is by far the most promising discussed thus far, experimental research is strongly recommended to further validate the authors’ claims.

Discussion

As the commercial aviation industry continues to grow across the world, the need to create low-carbon propulsion becomes increasingly apparent. While solutions such as all-electric, hydrogen, pure SAFs, or even pure ammonia may not yet be feasible primarily due to technological limitations, ammonia can still serve as a valuable stepping stone. See Table 5 for an overview of the conclusions drawn regarding all considered power sources. The use of ammonia as an additive to other fuels is an incredibly exciting idea, and while it may not be an entirely carbon-free solution, it will still decrease emissions if implemented. It also benefits from requiring minimal if any engine redesigns, as previously described, making it more simple to implement. This can be used as a transition period from our current lack of adequate solutions for carbon-free fuels like hydrogen. Thus, more research is strongly recommended within this area to experimentally validate the findings of the study discussed and to continue pushing for more sustainable aviation.

Table 5 | Metric Evaluation by Power Source

Experimentalist researchers ought to use the models previously described to guide their experiments in order to validate the findings these previous researchers have presented, directly furthering the line of inquiry into the use of ammonia as an additive. One recommended approach is testing different combinations of kerosene, hydrogen, and ammonia at conditions similar to an airplane engine, as previously described. Both the aviation industry and policymakers are strongly recommended to support the exploration and development of this technology through financial investments and policy support. It is also important to consider that all conclusions drawn and recommendations made in this paper are based on a literature review which, while as thorough as possible, does not preclude the existence of contradicting studies or information. The findings discussed above should be interpreted as a preliminary step toward creating a more sustainable future for aviation, whether or not ammonia is involved.

What began as cautious optimism has evolved into renewed confidence, record demand and long-term strategic investment. Airlines have rebuilt networks, manufacturers have increased output, and sustainability has moved from aspiration to action.

Below is a month-by-month look back at the 12 defining moments that shaped UK aviation and aerospace over the last year.

January – A Confident Start as Passenger Demand Holds Firm

The year opened with UK aviation in a far stronger position than many had anticipated. Passenger volumes through major hubs such as Heathrow Airport remained robust despite the traditional winter slowdown. Long-haul routes, particularly to North America and the Middle East, continued to perform strongly, while leisure demand across Europe showed little sign of weakening.

Airlines entered the year balancing strong bookings against rising costs, but January clearly signalled that passenger confidence had firmly returned.

February – Sustainable Aviation Fuel Moves Up the Agenda

February saw Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) gain further prominence as airlines, airports and manufacturers reiterated its importance in cutting aviation emissions this decade. Industry leaders emphasised that SAF represents the most practical near-term solution for decarbonising flight while new aircraft and propulsion technologies mature.

The focus also turned to the need for domestic SAF production, with calls for policy certainty to unlock investment and prevent reliance on imported fuel.

March – Fleet Modernisation Accelerates

As spring approached, UK airlines stepped up fleet renewal programmes. New-generation aircraft entered service offering improved fuel efficiency, lower noise footprints and enhanced passenger comfort. For operators, these investments were about more than sustainability — they also supported reliability, resilience and long-term cost control.

Older, less efficient aircraft continued to be phased out, reinforcing a shift towards smarter growth rather than simple capacity expansion.

April – Business Aviation Confirms Its Recovery

April highlighted the continued recovery of the business and private aviation sector. Operators reported strong utilisation across domestic and short-haul European routes, driven by demand for flexible, time-efficient travel.

Beyond corporate travel, business aviation continued to support a wide range of activity including medical services, energy operations and government flights, underlining its role within the broader UK aviation ecosystem.

May – UK Aerospace Manufacturing in Focus

Attention turned to the UK’s aerospace manufacturing base as global aircraft production rates increased. British suppliers played a central role in international programmes, particularly in advanced wing manufacture, systems integration and composite technologies.

Despite ongoing challenges around skills and supply chains, the sector demonstrated its strategic importance to global aerospace, supporting thousands of highly skilled jobs across the UK.

June – Preparing for a Demanding Summer

With forecasts pointing to one of the busiest summers on record, June was defined by preparation. Airports and airlines focused on improving operational resilience, investing in staffing, technology and passenger communications.

Lessons learned from previous peak seasons helped shape more coordinated planning, ensuring the industry entered summer better prepared than in recent years.

July – Record Summer Traffic Underlines Recovery

July delivered a clear confirmation of aviation’s resurgence. Passenger numbers surged across the UK, with several airports handling some of the highest volumes in their history. Leisure travel dominated, but business travel also showed steady signs of recovery.

Importantly, performance improved alongside volume, reinforcing public confidence in the sector’s ability to handle peak demand.

August – Airspace Modernisation Returns to Centre Stage

Peak summer operations once again highlighted the constraints of the UK’s complex and outdated airspace structure. August saw renewed calls for progress on airspace modernisation, widely regarded as essential for improving efficiency, reducing delays and cutting emissions.

Industry leaders stressed that modernised airspace is critical national infrastructure, not simply an aviation upgrade.

September – Regional Connectivity Back in the Spotlight

As summer demand eased, attention shifted to regional and domestic connectivity. Airlines, airports and local authorities highlighted the economic and social importance of reliable air links, particularly for remote and island communities.

Public Service Obligation routes and targeted investment were presented as vital tools in maintaining balanced national connectivity.

October – Aerospace and Space Industries Converge

October underlined the growing alignment between the UK’s aerospace and space sectors. Developments in launch capability, uncrewed systems and advanced manufacturing demonstrated how skills, infrastructure and supply chains increasingly overlap.

This convergence reinforced the UK’s ambition to play a significant role in the global space economy while creating new opportunities for traditional aerospace firms.

November – Aircraft Orders Signal Long-Term Confidence

The autumn brought renewed focus on long-term growth as airlines announced major aircraft orders and future commitments. These decisions reflected confidence extending well into the next decade, supported by expectations of sustained leisure and business travel demand.

For manufacturers and suppliers, the announcements provided valuable certainty for workforce planning and investment.

December – Sustainability, Skills and the Road Ahead

As the year closed, industry discussion turned to the future. Sustainability remained a dominant theme, alongside the growing need to attract and retain skilled workers across engineering, flight operations and digital roles.

December served as a reminder that while growth has returned, it must be delivered responsibly, inclusively and with a clear focus on long-term resilience.

Looking Ahead

Taken together, the past 12 months mark a transition from recovery to renewal for UK aviation and aerospace. Strong demand, renewed investment and accelerating sustainability efforts have reshaped the sector’s outlook.

The challenge for the year ahead will be turning ambition into delivery – modernising infrastructure, scaling cleaner fuels and ensuring the workforce is ready for the next phase of growth. If the past year is any guide, UK aviation enters that challenge with confidence.",https://ukaviation.news/wp-content/uploads/DSC03365.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 11:13:05.802897

DevvStream, Southern, IP3, and XCF to Evaluate Development of America-First Nuclear Power, Advanced Fuels, and Digital Environmental Asset Monetization

Exploring U.S.-based nuclear power as a strategic enabler for advanced fuels, AI-era infrastructure, and tokenized environmental assets

Potential to advance next-generation eSAF pathways by pairing continuous clean electricity with electrolysis, hydrogen production, and low-carbon fuel synthesis

Assessing potential pathways for leveraging American power, American feedstocks, and American infrastructure to strengthen U.S. industrial and energy leadership

Sacramento, California – December 30, 2025 – DevvStream Corp. (Nasdaq: DEVS) (“DevvStream”), a leading carbon management and environmental-asset monetization firm, today announced a non-binding memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) to evaluate a strategic collaboration focused on small modular reactor (“SMR”) nuclear power development, electro-sustainable aviation fuel (“eSAF”) production, and the creation, verification, and monetization of eligible environmental attributes alongside IP3 Corporation (“IP3”), Southern Energy Renewables Inc. (“Southern”), and XCF Global Inc. (“XCF”) (Nasdaq: SAFX) (together “the parties”).

The MOU outlines a proposed integrated framework to assess the development and deployment of firm, zero-carbon nuclear electricity from SMRs to support clean fuel production and energy-intensive end markets, including AI data centers, while enabling robust environmental-attribute structures that may meet evolving compliance, reporting, and market standards. The MOU also outlines a framework to explore the development and deployment of SMR-generated electricity to support existing and future operating assets, including a potential nuclear power solution for a proposed SAF refinery in Louisiana, and to enable a scalable portfolio of verifiable environmental attributes.

If pursued, the parties intend to advance reliable, zero-carbon nuclear power to enable continuous electrolysis, hydrogen production, and downstream fuel synthesis, while also supporting excess clean-power offtake for third-party customers where appropriate.

The parties also intend to evaluate, as part of the negotiation of definitive agreements, environmental-attribute structures associated with eSAF and related low-carbon fuel pathways, including emerging “book-and-claim” and SAF certificate frameworks that allow airlines and corporate buyers to access verified in-sector emissions reduction attributes when physical fuel delivery is constrained.

In parallel, and pending the execution of definitive agreements, the MOU contemplates future development of digital infrastructure to enhance transparency, provenance, and auditability, including tokenization of eligible environmental assets and the use of digital measurement, reporting, and verification (“MRV”) systems to support data quality, provenance, and auditability.

“Together, we are exploring real-world asset and tokenized environmental-asset frameworks with the potential to unlock additional value, improve liquidity, and help lower the delivered cost of clean energy and fuels,” said Sunny Trinh, Chief Executive Officer of DevvStream. “We see this as a potential America-first model that combines U.S. resources, digital infrastructure, and scalable markets.”

“This MOU reflects our focus on putting American energy, infrastructure, and production first,” said Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern Energy Renewables. “As the development of advanced nuclear platforms gains momentum, we believe the goal of developing and deploying firm, domestic power is becoming essential for fuels, manufacturing, and data-driven industries. We are committed to exploring how nuclear power, combined with U.S. biomass resources, can enable an integrated, multi-product approach that strengthens U.S. industrial leadership while remaining globally competitive.”

RDML (Ret.) Mike Hewitt, Chief Executive Officer of IP3, added: “Clean, reliable nuclear power is increasingly being pursued as foundational infrastructure for American energy security and industrial growth. We are excited to explore a strategic relationship with XCF, DevvStream, and Southern, including the potential deployment of small modular reactor technology to provide firm power and support e‑SAF production for European markets. IP3’s business model to develop infrastructure projects to privatize Small Modular Reactors for multiple offtakers such as AI and data centers that support government and commercial requirements. We believe pairing firm power development with practical environmental‑asset design and monetization can create a differentiated platform that meets real customer demand while delivering the transparency the market expects.”

“This MOU reflects XCF’s disciplined approach to evaluating infrastructure and partnerships that can strengthen the scalability, reliability, and carbon performance of next-generation sustainable aviation fuels,” said Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global. “We believe firm, zero-carbon power is an important enabler for eSAF pathways, and this collaboration, if ultimately pursued, is expected to allow us to assess how integrated power, fuel, and environmental-attribute frameworks could support broader adoption of clean fuels.”

The MOU reflects a shared intent to negotiate definitive collaboration agreements on SAF and other low-carbon fuel opportunities. Any specific collaboration arrangements, investments, or project development activities described in this release remain subject to confirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, internal corporate approvals, and any required regulatory or permitting approvals.

Background

India and Brazil are natural partners in the low-carbon bioenergy transition. Brazil has decades of experience in large-scale biofuel deployment, most famously its sugarcane-based ethanol program and a mature flex-fuel vehicle market, while India has moved aggressively in recent years to scale ethanol blending and to develop policy frameworks for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The two countries formalized energy and biofuel cooperation through a series of memoranda and joint statements: New Delhi’s Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and its Brazilian counterparts highlighted SAF and biofuel collaboration in a joint statement on 21 September 2024, and broader bioenergy MOUs and bilateral instruments between India and Brazil date back several years and were reiterated during high-level exchanges in 2024–2025.

The strategic logic is straightforward. India is a fast-growing aviation market with an urgent decarbonization imperative; Brazil is a global leader in feedstock-to-biofuel value chains and has operational experience in producing low-cost, low-GHG ethanol at scale. A partnership that bridges Brazilian feedstock expertise, technology and investment with Indian market scale, refinery infrastructure and regulatory momentum offers a practical route to accelerate SAF availability in both hemispheres.

Functioning

India–Brazil cooperation on biofuels and SAF functions through several complementary channels: government-to-government frameworks, industry memoranda, technical exchanges and participation in multilateral initiatives.

At the government level, joint statements and MOUs create a policy architecture that enables dialogue on feedstock sustainability criteria, certification, testing and standards for SAF. The 2024 joint statement explicitly identified modes of cooperation that include catalysing regional value chains, ramping up SAF production, and harmonizing certification and distribution mechanisms — essential building blocks for cross-border SAF trade and “book-and-claim” schemes.

Technical and research linkages have also been institutionalized: Indian public sector refiners and research bodies have exchanged MOUs with Brazilian research institutions on bioenergy and conversion technologies (for example, cooperation involving Indian Oil Corporation and Brazilian research centers). These arrangements allow technology transfer, joint pilots (EG, waste-to-fuel pathways), and co-development of feedstock sustainability protocols that are sensitive to land-use and biodiversity concerns.

The industry needs to be involved. Brazil’s local SAF trials – such as initial “book-and-claim” pilots led by airlines and fuel companies – and India’s early state of industrialization (public and private refiner sector enthusiasm, university-industry collaboration) are resulting in on-the-ground demonstration projects that local authorities can back with money, purchasing targets, and providing regulation.

The worldwide environment is important as well: Intergovernmental bodies like the Global Biofuel Alliance (established during India’s G20 presidency) are opening up further channels to expand the good practices and draw foreign ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌investment.

Impact

Cooperation between India and Brazil on biofuels and SAF has multiple, interlocking impacts — environmental, economic and geopolitical.

Environmentally, scaling SAF reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from aviation when feedstocks and conversion pathways meet robust sustainability criteria. Brazil’s sugarcane ethanol is one of the lowest-carbon ethanol feedstocks globally, offering a model for low-GHG biofuel pathways; Coupling Brazilian expertise with Indian feedstock diversity (agricultural residues, municipal waste, non-food oilseeds) can expand low-carbon fuel supplies for regional aviation. The joint governmental emphasis on certifications and value chains intends to ensure the environmental integrity of any SAF that is produced or traded.

Economically, cooperation opens investment, trade and rural development pathways. For Brazil, diversified export markets for biofuel intermediates, technology and know-how reduce reliance on a limited set of buyers. For India, SAF and biofuel collaboration can support meeting domestic ethanol-blending targets, foster new industrial clusters (waste-to-fuel, integrated biorefineries), and generate rural employment through feedstock supply chains. Strategic supply partnerships can also mitigate fuel price volatility for airlines by providing alternative, domestically supported supply lines.

Geopolitically, stronger India–Brazil ties in low-carbon fuels help both countries exercise leadership in shaping global biofuel governance and standards. As large developing economies with agricultural footprints, their joint positions in forums such as the G20 and the Global Biofuel Alliance can influence which sustainability metrics and trade rules become mainstream, a non-trivial leverage point as SAF policy architecture and carbon markets evolve.

Performance

Assessing performance requires distinguishing policy intent, demonstration activity and commercial scaling each has progressed unevenly.

On policy intent and diplomatic signaling, performance has been strong: joint statements and MOUs since 2019 (and reiterated in 2024–2025 high-level exchanges) show sustained political will to prioritize bioenergy cooperation and to frame SAF as a shared strategic objective. The public documentation of these commitments is a positive indicator that both capitals treat the issue as part of their energy diplomacy.

On demonstrations and pilots, progress is tangible but still nascent. Brazil has operational experience with SAF pilots and book-and-claim trials (for example, Latin America’s first book-and-claim transaction involving Gol and Vibra in mid-2024), illustrating the commercial mechanics and governance challenges of non-physical SAF accounting. India has begun institutional measures (research partnerships, industry MOUs and university–aircraft maker collaborations) to replicate and adapt these models domestically, but large-scale, continuous SAF production in India remains in early stages.

On commercial scaling, both countries face constraints: feedstock competition with food uses, capital intensity of advanced conversion technologies, and the still-limited global SAF market that keeps offtake uncertain. Technical performance metrics (yields, GHG savings, lifecycle assessments) are promising for certain pathways, but translating pilots into gigalitres of SAF will require stronger policy incentives (mandates, blending targets, procurement commitments), financing instruments and clear international certification that enables trade and “book & claim” mechanisms at scale.

Way Forward

To turn policy momentum into measurable SAF volumes and lasting low-carbon impact, India and Brazil should pursue a pragmatic, multi-track agenda that accelerates supply, reduces risk and ensures sustainability.

Operationalize certification and harmonize sustainability criteria. Establish a joint technical working group to align lifecycle GHG accounting, land-use change methodologies and feedstock eligibility rules so SAF from either country is tradeable with confidence. Harmonized criteria will lower transaction costs for international buyers and support book-and-claim systems.

Scale demonstration projects with co-financing. Leverage public finance (multilateral development banks, green bonds) and blended finance to derisk first-of-a-kind commercial SAF plants in India and Brazil. Bilateral co-investment vehicles or concessional lines could mobilize private capital and ensure demonstrations focus on diverse feedstocks (sugarcane residues, municipal solid waste, used cooking oil, non-food oilseeds).

Create demand-pull via procurement and mandates. Governments and national carriers should issue time-bound procurement commitments and explore progressive blending targets for aviation where feasible. Public procurement and airport-level incentives can provide the guaranteed offtake needed to attract downstream investment. Mechanisms such as book-and-claim should be piloted with rigorous oversight to avoid greenwashing.

Promote technology exchange and skills transfer. Brazil’s operational lessons in feedstock logistics and ethanol economics should be embedded into India’s industrial plans through exchange programs, joint R&D and transfer of best practices in agronomy, processing and refinery co-processing of bio-feedstocks. Collaborative training will ensure local workforces in India can operate advanced biorefineries.

Safeguard sustainability and social inclusion. Biofuel scale-up must be accompanied by land-use safeguards, smallholder inclusion strategies, and transparent benefit-sharing arrangements. Both countries should pilot supply chain traceability and social impact monitoring to prevent adverse outcomes (eg, indirect land-use change or inequitable value capture).

Link to global markets and carbon pricing mechanisms. Position India–Brazil SAF as supply nodes in the global SAF ecosystem by negotiating mutual recognition of certifications and participating in international platforms (eg, Global Biofuel Alliance). Where appropriate, integrate SAF credits with credible carbon markets to channel finance toward the highest-integrity SAF projects.

Conclusion

India and Brazil bring complementary assets to the challenge of decarbonizing aviation: Brazil’s proven feedstock and industrial experience, and India’s growing aviation demand, refinery capabilities and policy momentum. The diplomatic commitments and MOUs of recent years have established a sound platform; the next phase must convert that platform into concrete SAF gallons through harmonized standards, financed demonstrations, demand-pull mechanisms and safeguards that prioritize sustainability and social inclusion. If executed well, India–Brazil cooperation on biofuels and SAF can not only cut aviation emissions regionally but also shape global biofuel governance offering a model of South–South cooperation that pairs technical competence with market scale.

DIA handled a record 82.4 million passengers last year and projects traffic to exceed 120 million annually by 2045.

Drivers include transitioning fossil fuel-based equipment to electric to cut emissions and powering new concourses and gates, as well as a new consolidated rental car facility that anticipates rental EV power needs.

“As one of the busiest airports in the world, we are actively planning for an anticipated 120 million plus annual passengers by 2045,” Phil Washington, chief executive officer at Denver International Airport, said in the release. “Significantly more electricity will be required to power our future operations and accommodate changes coming to the aviation industry in the form of electric-powered aircraft and other advancements.”

The request seeks information on integrating clean energy solutions into the airport’s existing distribution network, as well as options for redundancy and energy storage to support peak demand now and in the future.

Washington said the airport has a responsibility to evaluate all potential clean energy sources that could meet that demand. Washington said the airport cannot wait for demand to outpace supply.

“This RFI is about gathering information so DIA can continue to be an innovative thought leader and understand more about new and emerging technologies that could help ensure the airport remains Colorado’s top economic engine for future generations,” Washington said.

The airport held five community meetings between October and December to gather input that helped develop questions included in the request.

Officials sought to examine the feasibility of an on-site small modular nuclear reactor in August but delayed the study after community criticism over a lack of prior consultation. The airport issued a request for proposals on Aug. 6 for the study, but postponed it on Aug. 8 to allow more public engagement.

Washington said the airport is committed to taking community feedback into consideration as it moves forward with efforts to learn more about potential clean energy solutions.

Residents from Montbello and Green Valley Ranch expressed strong concerns at a Dec. 17 meeting about potential health risks and environmental impacts from energy expansion, especially nuclear options. Denver City Councilmember Stacie Gilmore urged excluding nuclear. Washington flatly declined to remove nuclear from consideration, stating the airport would not limit company responses prematurely.

Washington said the airport is committed to becoming the world’s greenest airport. The airport’s current energy portfolio includes 11 solar arrays totaling 50 megawatts, with an upcoming project set to add 18 megawatts. The airport is also exploring renewable natural gas, sustainable aviation fuel, geothermal, hydrogen, wind, and battery backup to support renewables and microgrid resiliency, according to Washington.",https://www.denvergazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/b16692c6700510b785bae1e664af96d0-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 11:13:09.277369

“There wasn’t specific discussion about uranium or fracking, or even the fact that (natural resource development) would be the headline push of the second mandate,” Urbaniak said.
Environmental advocates, meanwhile, have said they worry about the potential environmental and health risks tied to fracking and uranium mining.
When asked about these concerns, Klimek said, ""Premier Houston is a Nova Scotian first.
Technology has evolved, and today resource development is governed by rigorous, modern safeguards.""","HALIFAX — In the year since the Nova Scotia Progressive Conservatives under Premier Tim Houston won a resounding second mandate, the government's focus has largely been on a topic that didn't get much attention during the 2024 election campaign.

Houston's Tories have lifted a moratorium on fracking and a ban on uranium mining, and opened calls for offshore oil and gas exploration bids. They've introduced measures to streamline both the environmental assessments for energy projects and the permitting processes for mining. And the premier laid out plans for a massive offshore wind energy development.

To top it off, in October, Houston named himself energy minister.

Political science experts say that had Houston given voters details about his energy ideas, the November election campaign — after which the Progressive Conservatives won 43 out of 55 seats — may have looked different.

“If there had been more details about critical minerals, what that means for private property potentially, that would have been the dominant discussion in the election campaign,” Tom Urbaniak, a political scientist at Cape Breton University, said in an interview Tuesday.

“There wasn’t specific discussion about uranium or fracking, or even the fact that (natural resource development) would be the headline push of the second mandate,” Urbaniak said.

Instead, the Progressive Conservative campaign focused on lowering some taxes, raising the minimum wage, and hiring more doctors to support the health system. Much of those promises have been fulfilled. The Department of Health says there are 453 more physicians working in Nova Scotia now than in 2021 when the Progressive Conservatives were first elected. The department was not immediately able to provide the number of new doctors hired since the November 2024 election.

To address affordability, the premier pledged to ""ensure power-rate fairness"" by capping increases to the Canadian average, which has not yet happened. The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a question about progress toward implementing the promised cap.

Lori Turnbull, a political scientist with Dalhousie University, said Tuesday that political parties never do exactly what they include in campaign materials, because unpredictable challenges arise once they enter office.

""But I think the question is, did you intentionally not tell us because you knew it would be controversial, and you didn't want the campaign to be taken over by something like this? Because it is an issue that is polarizing,"" Turnbull said, adding that she can't speculate on when Houston decided he would make a push for natural resource development.

""If you start talking about the possibility of fracking, possibility of opening up uranium mines, and all of the environmental and health risks that go along with that, that's the type of thing that, even though it might not be anyone's Number 1 issue … these other things can become the split issue in the campaign,"" she said.

On the campaign trail, the premier did not hold a stand-alone press conference to highlight his natural resources plans, as he did with many election promises. The campaign material said, ""the path to future economic prosperity must include a refocusing back to our natural resources."" It made note of critical mineral potential, without specifics, and said efforts will be made to develop sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen.

When asked why natural resource development was not emphasized as a key issue on the campaign trail, a spokesperson for the premier said Houston made it clear to voters he would be focused on growing the economy.

""Then (U.S.) President Trump launched a tariff war against Canada. That made it even clearer we must be more self-sufficient — at a time when a new prime minister is pushing Canada to be an energy superpower and our deficit remains a reality. So we acted,"" said Catherine Klimek.

There has been criticism over Houston's speedy push for mining and natural resource development, with the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi’kmaw Chiefs raising concerns in June about government failing to consult with them before the province issued a request for exploration proposals for three sites with known deposits of uranium in. No companies came forward with a bid.

Environmental advocates, meanwhile, have said they worry about the potential environmental and health risks tied to fracking and uranium mining.

When asked about these concerns, Klimek said, ""Premier Houston is a Nova Scotian first. He would never put our province at risk. Technology has evolved, and today resource development is governed by rigorous, modern safeguards.""

On Dec. 22, the government said it was putting Dalhousie University in charge of a $30-million program that will see a call for onshore natural-gas exploration in the new year. Officials said new natural-gas development will allow the province to cut back on burning coal for electricity generation and help it hit its 2030 emission targets.

However, a former university president who oversaw the report that led to a decade-long ban on fracking in Nova Scotia has questioned the government’s claims that natural gas would lower emissions and energy prices.

Starting in 2027, Brazilian airlines will have to add some portion of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to fossil aviation kerosine to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 1% according to legislation passed last year. Petrobras believes it will be able to meet 100% of the national demand for sustainable aviation fuel between 2027 and 2029.

The Brazilian oil company intends to meet the demand for SAF with its products manufactured via the co-processing route. The company stated that it can meet the initial demand from four refineries in southeastern Brazil. After that, the company plans units dedicated to the production of SAF.

Starting in January of 2029, airline operators in Brazil are forced to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2%. Those percentages then grow by one point a year to 10% in 2037. Currently, the company can already produce SAF through co-processing with 1% renewable content in its Reduc refinery in Rio de Janeiro and Revap refinery in Sao Paulo. Starting the second half of 2026, its Regap refinery in Minas Gerais will produce 1% renewable and its Replan refinery in Sao Paulo up to 5%.

After 2029,Petrobras plans to start production of SAF in dedicated units, starting with the RPBC (Sao Paulo) refinery, with 15 thousand barrels per day. Subsequently, the company plans to produce 19 thousand barrels per day at the Boaventura complex (Rio de Janeiro) and 10 thousand per day at Replan.

Petrobras made its first delivery of SAF to the Galeao airport in Rio in early December after becoming the first to produce the fuel entirely in the country. The 3 thousand cubic meters of SAF delivered to the airport was the equivalent of a day of consumption at the airport.

Annika Tibbe leaves no room for doubt. Neste, the world’s largest producer of sustainable aviation fuel SAF and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), is sticking to its plans, even though some airlines are now criticizing the blending obligation for sustainable aviation fuels and voluntary blending remains relatively limited. “Let me be clear: we need ambitious and stable government policy to get the market moving. Because although there is some voluntary demand for SAF, it is still too low to make a difference. As long as it isn’t compulsory, most airlines and transport companies will continue to choose the cheapest option. Currently, there are simply not enough customers who are willing to pay a premium for more sustainable flying and more sustainable transport.”

Few people have heard of Neste. What exactly do you do?

“Neste was founded shortly after the Second World War to guarantee Finland’s energy supply. For a long time, we were just a regular oil company, but around the turn of the century we started producing renewable fuels. Initially, we mainly produced renewable diesel (HVO). Around 2010, we added SAF on a small scale. Today, we are the world’s largest producer of HVO and SAF. Since 2011, we’ve had a refinery in Rotterdam, which is currently the largest biorefinery in Europe. Originally we primarily produced HVO there, but early this year we started producing SAF on an industrial scale. In addition, we are investing €3 billion to double the production capacity of this location. This will make our Rotterdam facility the largest biorefinery in the world by 2027.” … … …

Director of the ARC Research Hub for Engineering Plants to Replace Fossil Carbon, Associate Professor Karine Chenu, says the team is focusing on creating better inputs for processing.

Chenu says most of the research investment in this space has shown that processing plant biomass into aviation biofuels or other bioproducts is technically viable and should be done.

“But the price of sustainable aviation fuel is still typically two or three times the price of standard jet fuel and no one wants the price of flying to go up,” the Associate Professor says.

“We need to make the more environmentally desirable option at a price that’s competitive.

“As processing methods are already in place, one of the Hub’s main focuses is on using new scientific capabilities to improve plant biomass, making it easier to process.”

By understanding and modifying the biosynthesis and composition of plant cell walls, the research team will increase the proportion of carbon that can be converted to a final product, whether that be a fuel or a biomaterial, Chenu adds.

Hub Chief Investigator Emeritus Professor Robert Henry says having a product that is easier to process, cost effective, and sustainable is where future gains could be made.

For example, with sugarcane only 20-25% of the carbon in the bagasse can be converted to carbon in the fuel, Henry says, adding the aim is to increase that to 50%.

“We can see a path to producing sustainable aviation fuel at a price that’s competitive with the fossil product, which would greatly accelerate adoption,” Henry says.

Launched in November, the ARC Research Hub is a collaborative structure in partnership with industry in Australia and internationally is designed to support innovation and deliver practical outcomes.

It has partners across the whole value chain from spatial genomics and technology companies to the farm and potential processors.

(Topsoe) • Topsoe has been selected by ANCAP to deliver technology and services for a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel plant at the La Teja Refinery in Montevideo.

The project will use Topsoe’s HydroFlex® technology, proprietary equipment and catalysts enabling the production of 3,000 barrels of SAF and renewable diesel per day.

The plant is expected to reach FID in 2027, with operations due to commence in 2030.

Topsoe, a leading global provider of advanced technology and solutions for the energy transition, has signed an agreement with Administración Nacional de Combustibles, Alcohol y Portland (ANCAP), Uruguay’s state-owned energy company. Under this agreement, Topsoe will deliver technology and services for ANCAP’s hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) unit located at the La Teja Refinery in Montevideo.

The project will use Topsoe’s HydroFlex® technology, proprietary equipment and catalysts enabling the production of SAF and renewable diesel.

The project is expected to reach Final Investment Decision (FID) in 2027, with commercial operations due to begin in 2030. Once operational, the facility will use rapeseed oil and beef tallow as feedstock to produce approximately 3,000 barrels of SAF and renewable diesel per day.

The project when operational, will avoid over 390,000 tons of CO₂ emissions - the equivalent of removing around 90,000 petrol-powered passenger vehicles from the road for one year. [1]

Elena Scaltritti, Chief Commercial Officer at Topsoe, said:

“This project is an important step forward in advancing Uruguay’s sustainable fuel ambitions and, more importantly, resembles strong momentum for the rollout of renewable fuels across Latin America. This collaboration demonstrates how Topsoe’s proven technologies are contributing to creating progress on a global scale, and we look forward to working with ANCAP to deliver this critical project.”

José Pastorino, Energy Products Manager at ANCAP said:

“The HEFA project is the largest in the portfolio of the refining business for ANCAP. Furthermore, it is the most important project in terms of advancing towards our strategy for a more sustainable future for the energy landscape in Uruguay. We at ANCAP are eager to commence working in the engineering stage and look forward to working in it with Topsoe.”

According to the IEA, aviation accounts for about 2% of CO2 emissions, and aviation emissions are expected to double by 2050 as aviation demand grows[2]. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimates that in Latin America, air travel is expected to more than triple by 2050 and thereby double today’s aviation emissions in the region[3]. This agreement will help to address the growing demand for SAF in the region.

About HydroFlex

With HydroFlex, customers can convert various fats, oils and greases into drop-in renewable jet and diesel that meet all globally accepted specifications for these fuels. Topsoe’s HydroFlex can be deployed in both grassroots units and revamps for co-processing or fully renewable applications.

About ANCAP

Administración Nacional de Combustibles, Alcohol y Portland (ANCAP) is Uruguay’s state-owned energy company and a key actor in ensuring affordable and accessible energy availability for the population, with a focus on promoting energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions.

Since 2021, Brussels Airport has been testing innovative mobility and energy solutions with the potential to make airport operations more sustainable. These innovations are part of the EU-funded STARGATE(opens in new window) project aimed to help create the green airports and aviation of the future. One of the solutions tested at the airport is a fully autonomous, electric shuttle, the “first of its kind in Belgium,” according to a news item(opens in new window) posted on the ‘Aviation Direct’ website. The shuttle is equipped with cameras and sensors, and it was initially tested on the airside – the airport’s restricted zone beyond the security checkpoints – from late 2024 to early 2025. It is now undergoing its second testing phase, running between the airport terminal and an employee parking area. Another innovation is the exploration of new uses for locally generated energy. The news item reports that at the start of 2025, approximately 100 homes from four communities in the vicinity were offered locally generated electricity from the airport’s solar panels for an entire year. During this trial phase, which ends in February 2026, STARGATE will assess whether such community energy projects are feasible and scalable. STARGATE also plans to transform staff and passenger transport at Brussels Airport. “A multimodal travel planner evaluates transport options based on various criteria and assists passengers and staff in planning their journeys,” the news item states. In the summer of 2025, the airport also introduced a new bicycle rental system for its 30 000 or so employees. An estimated 48 bicycles, almost half of which are electric, are available for rent at five stations. As the project enters its final stretch until October 2026, additional solutions will be trialled at the airport, including an autonomous cargo transport vehicle and a mobile fuel blending plant. At the same time, similar STARGATE initiatives are being carried out at different partner airports across Europe. The electrification of airside areas is being tested at Athens International Airport Eleftherios Venizelos, an airport mobility plan is being developed at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport and a new navigation app to improve airside vehicle safety has been introduced at Budapest Airport.

DevvStream and Southern may also file other documents with the SEC and Canadian securities regulatory authorities regarding the proposed transaction.","SACRAMENTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--DevvStream Corp. (Nasdaq: DEVS) (“DevvStream”), a leading carbon management and environmental-asset monetization firm, today announced a non-binding memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) to evaluate a strategic collaboration focused on small modular reactor (“SMR”) nuclear power development, electro-sustainable aviation fuel (“eSAF”) production, and the creation, verification, and monetization of eligible environmental attributes alongside IP3 Corporation (“IP3”), Southern Energy Renewables Inc. (“Southern”), and XCF Global Inc. (“XCF”) (Nasdaq: SAFX) (together “the parties”).

The MOU outlines a proposed integrated framework to assess the development and deployment of firm, zero-carbon nuclear electricity from SMRs to support clean fuel production and energy-intensive end markets, including AI data centers, while enabling robust environmental-attribute structures that may meet evolving compliance, reporting, and market standards. The MOU also outlines a framework to explore the development and deployment of SMR-generated electricity to support existing and future operating assets, including a potential nuclear power solution for a proposed SAF refinery in Louisiana, and to enable a scalable portfolio of verifiable environmental attributes.

If pursued, the parties intend to advance reliable, zero-carbon nuclear power to enable continuous electrolysis, hydrogen production, and downstream fuel synthesis, while also supporting excess clean-power offtake for third-party customers where appropriate.

The parties also intend to evaluate, as part of the negotiation of definitive agreements, environmental-attribute structures associated with eSAF and related low-carbon fuel pathways, including emerging “book-and-claim” and SAF certificate frameworks that allow airlines and corporate buyers to access verified in-sector emissions reduction attributes when physical fuel delivery is constrained.

In parallel, and pending the execution of definitive agreements, the MOU contemplates future development of digital infrastructure to enhance transparency, provenance, and auditability, including tokenization of eligible environmental assets and the use of digital measurement, reporting, and verification (“MRV”) systems to support data quality, provenance, and auditability.

“Together, we are exploring real-world asset and tokenized environmental-asset frameworks with the potential to unlock additional value, improve liquidity, and help lower the delivered cost of clean energy and fuels,” said Sunny Trinh, Chief Executive Officer of DevvStream. “We see this as a potential America-first model that combines U.S. resources, digital infrastructure, and scalable markets.”

“This MOU reflects our focus on putting American energy, infrastructure, and production first,” said Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern Energy Renewables. “As the development of advanced nuclear platforms gains momentum, we believe the goal of developing and deploying firm, domestic power is becoming essential for fuels, manufacturing, and data-driven industries.

Valero Energy NYSE: VLO and Phillips 66 NYSE: PSX are uniquely positioned to benefit from this diesel disconnect.
Phillips 66: The Architect of the Squeeze While Valero profits from running hard, Phillips 66 is generating value by actively reshaping the market.
In October 2025, Phillips 66 officially ceased crude processing at its Los Angeles Refinery (Wilmington/Carson).
In response, Phillips 66 launched the Streamline 66 initiative, a plan designed to cut costs and enhance shareholder returns.","Every December, the global supply chain undergoes a massive pressure test known as the Christmas Stress Test.

In a typical year, millions of holiday packages flood the logistics network. This surge usually drives up freight volumes (the amount of goods moving) and fuel demand simultaneously. However, the 2025 holiday season produced a rare and confusing anomaly that has left many investors scratching their heads.

While freight volumes remained relatively soft, indicating that consumers and businesses are spending cautiously, the price of diesel fuel surged. This creates a disconnect in the fundamental laws of supply and demand. Usually, weak demand leads to lower fuel prices. Instead, the cost of moving goods is rising even as the volume of goods moving slows.

For general industrial stocks like FedEx NYSE: FDX or retailers like Amazon NASDAQ: AMZN, this is a distinct warning sign. It suggests higher operating costs and lower profit margins heading into the first quarter of 2026. If it costs more to move fewer products, earnings will suffer.

However, for the companies that manufacture the fuel, this dynamic signals a massive profit windfall. Valero Energy NYSE: VLO and Phillips 66 NYSE: PSX are uniquely positioned to benefit from this diesel disconnect. While the broader economy worries about sticky inflation and logistics costs, these refiners are capitalizing on a market that is structurally short on supply.

The December Crack Back and the Diesel Margin Surge

To understand why these stocks are rising, investors must understand the crack spread. This financial metric represents the difference between the purchase price of crude oil and the selling price of refined products like diesel. It is, essentially, the refiner's gross profit margin.

In the fourth quarter of 2025, markets witnessed a phenomenon that traders are calling the December Crack Back. Margins for Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) in the New York Harbor market skyrocketed, hitting approximately $49 per barrel in late December—more than doubling from the low $20s seen just months prior in October.

This price spike is not driven by booming economic demand; it is driven by a supply shock. Three main factors are currently colliding to keep prices high:

Geopolitics: Tightened sanctions on Russian oil companies such as Rosneft and Lukoil in late 2025 effectively removed a significant volume of diesel from the global export market.

Winter Weather: Diesel fuel and home heating oil are chemically very similar. A cold snap in late 2025 increased demand for heating oil, drawing down the same inventories needed for trucking.

Capacity Cuts: Domestic refiners have permanently closed facilities to reduce costs, leaving the market with fewer barrels to go around.

For the general economy, high fuel prices during a freight recession increase the risk of a hard landing in 2026. However, for the refining sector, this supply shortage creates a high profit floor. Even if fewer trucks are on the road, the profit earned on every gallon of diesel sold remains historically high.

Valero Energy: The Operational Powerhouse

If the market is short on diesel, the company with the most functioning capacity stands to win the most.

Valero Energy has emerged as the clear operator's choice in this environment. The stock has outperformed the broader energy sector, gaining approximately 35% year-to-date.

Valero’s strategy is simple: operational excellence. While competitors have struggled with complicated restructurings, Valero has focused on running its machinery as efficiently as possible. In the third quarter of 2025, the company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $3.66, beating analyst expectations.

The key to Valero’s success is utilization. Their refineries have been running at near 97% capacity. In a market where margins are $49 per barrel, keeping utilization high translates directly into massive free cash flow.

Furthermore, Valero isn't just relying on old-school oil. The company is a leader in the transition to green energy through Diamond Green Diesel (DGD), its joint venture with Darling Ingredients. The expansion at their Port Arthur facility, completed earlier in 2025, allows them to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This creates a diversified revenue stream that appeals to investors looking for longevity. Valero captures the immediate upside of the diesel shortage while maintaining a foothold in the future of energy.

Phillips 66: The Architect of the Squeeze

While Valero profits from running hard, Phillips 66 is generating value by actively reshaping the market. In fact, Phillips 66 is partially responsible for the current high margins enjoyed by the entire industry.

In October 2025, Phillips 66 officially ceased crude processing at its Los Angeles Refinery (Wilmington/Carson). This move removed approximately 139,000 barrels per day of supply from the West Coast market. By taking this supply offline, Phillips 66 tightened the local market, driving up prices for the fuel produced by its remaining assets.

This aggressive decision-making is primarily driven by pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management, which has pushed the company to improve performance. In response, Phillips 66 launched the Streamline 66 initiative, a plan designed to cut costs and enhance shareholder returns.

The company has successfully executed this strategy, exceeding its $3 billion asset divestiture goal by late 2025, including the sale of its stake in a Swiss retail business and various pipeline assets.

Investment firm Raymond James maintained an Outperform rating on the stock in late December, citing the success of these self-help measures. For investors, Phillips 66 is a strategic play. It offers value through cost-cutting, share buybacks, and a more efficient portfolio, rather than just raw production volume.

2026 Outlook: How to Position Your Portfolio

The 2025 Christmas Stress Test has clarified the investment landscape for the new year. The global economy is facing a structural shortage of diesel refining capacity. This shortage insulates refiners from the economic headwinds that might hurt other industrial sectors.

Investors looking to trade this disconnect have two clear paths:

The Offensive Play: Valero Energy is the vehicle for immediate exposure to high profit margins. Their high utilization rates and established renewable diesel operations make them the primary beneficiary of the current price environment.

The Strategic Play: Phillips 66 offers a compelling narrative of restructuring. By closing high-cost assets like the LA refinery and satisfying activist demands, they are unlocking value on the balance sheet rather than just the income statement.

As we move into 2026, the data indicates that while the cost of shipping goods may remain a burden for the economy, the companies producing the fuel remain a bright spot for portfolios.

Under the leadership of Graz University of Technology (TU Graz), the research team is aiming for a waste-free and climate-neutral process that is also economically competitive.

In order to turn tomato waste into a high-quality fuel, the biomass must first be processed so that microorganisms can utilize it efficiently. ToFuel is investigating two modern fractionation technologies. During extrusion, the biomass is treated under heat and pressure and then broken down into its cellular components by an abrupt drop in pressure. This creates an optimally digested biomass for the subsequent fermentation process, in which microorganisms produce lipids that are later processed into aviation fuel. In the second fractionation technology, hydrothermal liquefaction, the biomass is converted into bio-oil and biochar under high pressure and at high temperatures, according to the report.",,N,,2025-12-30 11:57:57.297090

Trade policy shifts continue reshaping traditional trade relationships and commercial strategies throughout the renewable energy sector.","Understanding Tallow Trade Fundamentals

The global renewable energy transition has fundamentally altered traditional commodity markets, with animal-derived feedstocks emerging as critical components in biofuel production pathways. Tallow, classified as an animal by-product under international trade regulations, represents one of the most significant feedstocks in this transformation, bridging agricultural waste streams with advanced fuel technologies. Furthermore, tallow trade affected by US policy shifts has become a defining characteristic of modern commodity markets.

Modern tallow markets operate within a complex three-tier classification system based on disease risk assessment. Categories 1 and 2 tallow qualify for Tallow Methyl Ester (TME) production and benefit from double-counting mechanisms under specific renewable energy frameworks, while Category 3 tallow serves as the primary input for Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) Class III and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production.

Regional production centers have established distinct competitive advantages based on livestock density and processing infrastructure. Australian facilities benefit from record feedlot capacity of 1.7 million head with slaughter rates increasing nearly 10% year-on-year, while Brazilian operations have historically dominated export markets through integrated supply chains connecting cattle ranching with biodiesel refineries.

The commodity's unique properties create natural price correlations with competing feedstocks, particularly used cooking oil and soybean oil derivatives. These relationships generate complex arbitrage opportunities across geographic markets, with pricing differentials reflecting transportation costs, regulatory compliance requirements, and local mandates for renewable fuel blending.

What Policy Changes Are Driving Tallow Trade Disruption?

US Tariff Implementation Framework

Washington's implementation of a 50% composite tariff on Brazilian tallow imports, effective August 2025, represents the most significant policy intervention reshaping global trade flows. This tariff structure operates alongside the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which creates preferential treatment for North American feedstocks while reducing eligibility for foreign materials.

The tariff's impact became immediately apparent in bilateral trade data, with Brazilian exports to the US dropping sharply from September 2025 onwards. Previously, Brazil supplied 96% of US tallow imports in 2024, according to trade statistics from the US Department of Agriculture, making this policy shift particularly disruptive to established supply chains.

Additional regulatory uncertainty stems from potential modifications to Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits. Reports suggest the US EPA may indefinitely delay proposals to halve RIN credits for biofuels produced from foreign feedstocks, creating ongoing market speculation about future incentive structures.

The 45Z credit mechanism introduces sliding-scale incentives based on carbon intensity scoring, with soybean-based biodiesel eligible for approximately 32¢/USG in 2025, projected to increase to approximately 64¢/USG in 2026 as indirect land-use change penalties are removed from the calculation framework.

Comparative Policy Landscape Analysis

Table: Regional Policy Implementation Timeline and Trade Impact

Region Policy Mechanism Implementation Status Feedstock Treatment United States 50% Brazilian tariffs + 45Z credits Active August 2025 Domestic preference structure European Union RED III transposition January 2026 rollout Category-based restrictions Australia Cleaner Fuels Programme Mid-2026 launch A$1.1 billion stimulus package Netherlands 0.5 multiplication factor 2026 implementation Category 3 limitations France Category 3 caps 2027 scheduled Volume restrictions planned Germany GHG quota exclusions Currently active Category 3 complete exclusion

European Union member states demonstrate significant divergence in RED III transposition approaches, creating regulatory arbitrage opportunities across jurisdictions. Nordic countries, France, Italy, and Spain maintain higher utilisation rates for Category 3 volumes, while Germany excludes Category 3 entirely from greenhouse gas reduction quotas.

This fragmented implementation creates uneven demand signals for 2026, with southern and Nordic markets remaining active buyers while northern European ports face restricted access for specific tallow categories. Consequently, the resulting compliance complexity forces market participants to develop jurisdiction-specific certification pathways and documentation systems.

Australia's A$1.1 billion Cleaner Fuels Programme represents a different policy approach, focusing on domestic demand stimulus rather than trade restrictions. Industry participants hope this initiative will precede a federal biofuels mandate, providing long-term investment certainty through guaranteed offtake mechanisms.

How Are Regional Regulatory Frameworks Affecting Market Access?

European Union Compliance Complexity

The EU's animal by-products regulation establishes a sophisticated risk-based categorisation system that directly impacts market access and pricing dynamics. Categories 1 and 2, listed in RED III Annex IX Part B, benefit from double-counting mechanisms in specific member states, enhancing their carbon credit value and market competitiveness.

This regulatory framework creates material compliance costs through mandatory chain of custody certification, carbon intensity calculations, and third-party verification of feedstock origins. The documentation requirements extend throughout the supply chain, from slaughter facilities to end-use refineries, creating barriers to entry for smaller market participants.

Member state discretion in RED III transposition has generated significant regulatory divergence. The Netherlands plans to apply a 0.5 multiplication factor from 2026, effectively reducing the volume of qualifying tallow, while France plans caps on Category 3 tallow from 2027. These restrictions contrast sharply with southern and Nordic markets that maintain more accommodating frameworks.

Regulatory Arbitrage Opportunities

The multiplication factor mechanism creates immediate arbitrage opportunities for exporters capable of navigating multiple jurisdictions. Tallow volumes that face restrictions in Germany or the Netherlands retain full value in France, Italy, or Spain, incentivising sophisticated logistics and certification strategies.

The fragmented EU regulatory approach creates complex compliance requirements for market participants, with divergence between ambitious renewable fuel targets and member state restrictions generating inefficiencies throughout the supply chain.

Carbon intensity scoring methodologies vary significantly across member states, creating additional complexity for international traders. These variations reflect different approaches to lifecycle assessment calculations, transportation emissions accounting, and sustainability criteria verification processes.

The double-counting benefit available for Categories 1 and 2 in certain jurisdictions creates premium pricing opportunities compared to Category 3 materials, despite similar technical specifications. This regulatory distinction drives market segmentation and influences production planning at rendering facilities worldwide.

Where Are Tallow Flows Being Redirected Due to Policy Barriers?

Asian Market Absorption Capacity

Singapore has emerged as the primary destination for redirected tallow flows, receiving 27% of Australian exports in the year to September 2025. This consolidation reflects Singapore's role as a regional hub for renewable fuel production and its favourable regulatory treatment of animal-derived feedstocks.

The Asian market's absorption capacity has been enhanced by substantial growth in Chinese used cooking oil methyl ester (UCOME) flows. Chinese exports to Singapore reached 180,122 tonnes through October 2025, already exceeding the full-year 2024 total of 173,340 tonnes. This growth pattern indicates robust regional demand for renewable feedstock blending.

Price competitiveness drives much of this regional reallocation, with B30 delivered Singapore values averaging $732.58/tonne between April and December 2025, compared to $792.90/tonne for B30 UCOME delivered to Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp over the same period. This $60.32/tonne discount reflects both transportation advantages and reduced regulatory compliance costs in Asian markets.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel production represents an emerging demand driver throughout the region, though pricing competitiveness remains the primary determinant of feedstock selection. In addition, regional SAF mandates and carbon pricing mechanisms are still developing, creating future upside potential for tallow demand growth.

Brazilian Market Rebalancing Strategies

Brazilian domestic absorption has increased dramatically following US market access restrictions, with tallow utilisation by the biodiesel industry rising from 5% in July 2025 to 9.5% in October 2025. This rapid adjustment demonstrates the domestic industry's capacity to absorb volumes previously destined for export markets.

Seasonal demand dynamics continue to influence Brazilian market patterns, with November 2025 experiencing cooling demand due to typical drops in diesel consumption. However, tallow prices remained high compared to Australian alternatives, limiting export competitiveness to alternative markets despite improved domestic absorption.

Soybean oil price correlation creates additional complexity for Brazilian exporters, as tallow pricing tends to track soy oil movements. Industry participants anticipate that projected declines in soybean oil prices could potentially restore export economics viability, particularly for EU-certified material destined for European markets.

Brazilian exporters are strategically positioning for potential early 2026 EU shipments by acquiring necessary sustainability certifications. This preparation reflects expectations that European demand will strengthen as RED III implementation creates tighter supply-demand balances across member states.

What Compliance Challenges Are Emerging for Market Participants?

Certification and Traceability Requirements

Contemporary compliance frameworks require comprehensive documentation systems spanning the entire supply chain. Chain of custody certification must track material flows from origin through processing, while carbon intensity calculations demand sophisticated lifecycle assessment capabilities that many smaller participants struggle to implement cost-effectively.

Third-party verification requirements add another layer of complexity and expense, with accredited auditors necessary to validate sustainability claims. These requirements create material transaction costs that favour larger, vertically integrated operations capable of spreading compliance expenses across substantial volume throughput.

Documentation standards vary significantly across jurisdictions, forcing international traders to maintain multiple certification pathways simultaneously. EU sustainability criteria differ from US EPA requirements, while Asian markets often rely on less stringent documentation, creating operational complexity for global market participants.

Carbon intensity scoring methodologies represent particularly challenging technical requirements, with different calculation approaches determining tax credit eligibility across various markets. These methodologies require specialised expertise and sophisticated data management systems that create barriers to market entry.

Risk Management Framework Development

The evolving regulatory landscape demands sophisticated risk management approaches that traditional commodity trading frameworks cannot adequately address. Policy risk exposure requires hedging strategies that account for potential changes in tariff structures, credit eligibility, and certification requirements.

Long-term contract negotiations have become increasingly challenging due to regulatory uncertainty. Standard force majeure clauses may not adequately protect against policy changes that fundamentally alter market access or economic viability of specific trade routes.

Basis differential expansion between regions reflects increasing policy divergence and compliance costs. Forward curve volatility during policy transition periods creates additional pricing complexity that requires enhanced analytical capabilities and more sophisticated trading strategies.

Tallow trade affected by US policy shifts requires market participants to develop comprehensive regulatory intelligence capabilities, incorporating policy monitoring, compliance cost analysis, and strategic planning for multiple regulatory scenarios.

How Are Investment Decisions Being Influenced by Policy Uncertainty?

Capital Allocation Impacts

Investment decision frameworks must now incorporate policy risk assessment as a primary variable in project evaluation. The 45Z credit structure's sliding scale approach creates uncertainty about future incentive values, complicating long-term investment planning for domestic US biofuel production facilities.

Australian market participants await clarity on biofuel mandate implementation following the Cleaner Fuels Programme launch. Industry hopes for federal mandate follow-through reflect recognition that guaranteed offtake mechanisms are typically required for final investment decisions in capital-intensive renewable fuel projects.

European renewable fuel obligation variations across member states influence regional processing capacity development decisions. However, investors must evaluate not only current regulatory frameworks but also anticipated harmonisation efforts and potential policy convergence scenarios over project lifecycles.

Transportation infrastructure adaptation requires substantial capital commitment with uncertain policy-dependent returns. Pipeline systems, storage facilities, and port infrastructure investments must account for potential trade flow redirections based on evolving regulatory landscapes.

Strategic Planning Considerations

Vertical integration trends reflect efforts to reduce exposure to regulatory arbitrage and compliance complexity. Domestic feedstock preference driving consolidation creates competitive advantages for integrated operations capable of controlling supply chains from source to end-use.

Geographic diversification strategies must balance market access opportunities against compliance cost variations. Furthermore, companies are developing multi-jurisdictional approaches that maintain flexibility to redirect volumes based on regulatory changes and market conditions.

Technology investment priorities increasingly focus on compliance automation and data management systems. Carbon intensity tracking capabilities and certification workflow management represent essential infrastructure investments for sustained market participation.

What Market Structure Changes Are Policy Shifts Creating?

Vertical Integration Trends

The regulatory complexity is accelerating industry consolidation as smaller participants struggle with compliance costs and documentation requirements. Vertically integrated operations gain competitive advantages through scale economies in certification processes and enhanced supply chain control.

Regional processing capacity development reflects policy incentives favouring domestic production. US tariff impacts benefit facilities through 45Z credit eligibility restrictions on foreign feedstocks, while European plants must navigate member state variations in category restrictions and multiplication factors.

Supply chain diversification imperatives drive investment in multiple geographic sourcing options. Companies are establishing procurement relationships across different regulatory jurisdictions to maintain flexibility as policy landscapes evolve.

Price Discovery Mechanism Evolution

Traditional pricing benchmarks face challenges from regulatory fragmentation and compliance cost variations. Basis differential expansion between regions reflects not only transportation costs but also regulatory compliance expenses and market access restrictions.

Forward curve construction must incorporate policy risk premiums that reflect potential regulatory changes. Commodity market volatility in pricing models becomes essential for accurate valuation in an environment of heightened policy uncertainty.

Transaction cost increases from compliance requirements affect market liquidity and price discovery efficiency. The additional documentation and verification steps create friction that favours larger transactions and longer-term contractual relationships.

Strategic Outlook for 2026-2027

Policy Convergence Scenarios

US RIN credit modifications remain under consideration, with potential implications for foreign feedstock competitiveness. Indefinite delay reports create ongoing uncertainty that affects long-term planning and investment decisions across the industry.

EU member state harmonisation prospects depend on European Commission guidance and political coordination efforts. Tariff trade disruptions in some jurisdictions create temporary arbitrage opportunities while increasing overall market uncertainty.

Asia-Pacific regulatory framework development remains in early stages, with significant potential for future policy intervention as regional governments pursue carbon reduction targets and energy security objectives.

Market Efficiency Implications

The increasing complexity of regulatory compliance creates material efficiency losses through transaction cost increases and regional price divergence. These inefficiencies may persist until policy frameworks achieve greater stability and harmonisation.

Long-term supply security considerations drive strategic stockpiling and diversified sourcing strategies that may not represent optimal economic allocation but provide risk mitigation against policy disruptions.

Carbon pricing mechanism integration across jurisdictions represents a potential pathway toward policy convergence, though implementation timelines and technical specifications remain uncertain across major markets.

Risk Assessment Framework

Key Policy Risk Factors

Regulatory implementation delays creating extended market uncertainty

In the early days of aviation, pilots relied on mechanical ingenuity and sheer human skill to keep aircraft aloft. The Wright brothers’ 1903 Flyer was a marvel of wood, wire and fabric, controlled by warping wings and a rudimentary elevator. Fast-forward to today, and the cockpit has transformed into a high-tech command center where computers orchestrate everything from takeoff to landing. This shift didn’t happen overnight; it was a gradual infusion of digital technology that fundamentally altered how planes fly and how the industry operates. Drawing from historical accounts and recent innovations, we explore this evolution, crediting insights from sources like the Introduction to Aerospace Flight Vehicles by Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, which details the progression from basic flight vehicles to sophisticated systems.

Computers first entered aviation in subtle ways, often as tools for calculation rather than direct control. During World War II, analog computers helped with bomb aiming and navigation, but it was the post-war era that saw digital systems take root. By the 1950s, devices like the Bendix Central Air Data Computer used gears and synchros to compute airspeed and altitude, as noted in posts from X users discussing vintage aviation tech. These early systems laid the groundwork for more integrated roles, evolving from passive calculators to active participants in flight management.

The turning point came with the advent of fly-by-wire technology in the 1970s. Instead of mechanical linkages, electronic signals from the pilot’s controls are interpreted by computers, which then adjust flight surfaces. This innovation, pioneered in military jets like the F-16, allowed for unprecedented stability and efficiency. Commercial aviation soon followed, with Airbus introducing fly-by-wire in the A320 in 1988, a move that reduced weight and improved fuel economy.

From Cables to Code: The Rise of Fly-by-Wire Systems

Fly-by-wire systems represent a paradigm shift, where software mediates between pilot intent and aircraft response. Computers process inputs thousands of times per second, making micro-adjustments for smoother flights, as highlighted in a recent X post about modern airliners’ control surfaces. This technology not only enhances safety by preventing stalls but also enables envelope protection, where the system refuses commands that could endanger the plane.

Beyond control, computers revolutionized navigation. The inertial navigation systems of the 1960s gave way to GPS-integrated avionics in the 1990s, allowing precise positioning without ground-based aids. According to Centennial of Flight, these advancements ensured planes could reach destinations safely and on time, transforming global travel logistics.

The impact on the aviation industry extends to design and manufacturing. Computer-aided design (CAD) software has streamlined aircraft development, enabling simulations that test aerodynamics virtually before a single prototype is built. This has accelerated innovation cycles, reducing costs and time-to-market for new models.

Autopilot Evolution: From Gyroscopes to AI-Driven Guidance

Autopilots, once simple gyroscopic devices holding course, now incorporate artificial intelligence for complex tasks. Elmer Sperry’s 1914 invention evolved into systems that can manage entire flights, as described in the same Centennial of Flight resource. Modern autopilots integrate with flight management systems (FMS), optimizing routes for fuel efficiency and weather avoidance.

In recent years, AI has pushed boundaries further. A December 2025 X post recounted an incident where an autonomous system detected a pressurization issue at 23,000 feet, took control, communicated with air traffic control, and safely landed the plane. This level of autonomy hints at a future where pilots oversee rather than actively fly, raising questions about human roles in the cockpit.

The aviation sector has seen operational efficiencies soar thanks to these technologies. Airlines use big data analytics to predict maintenance needs, minimizing downtime. Spartan College outlines how such predictive maintenance has improved safety records, with fewer incidents due to mechanical failures.

Digital Twins and Simulation: Redefining Aircraft Design

One of the most profound changes is the use of digital twins—virtual replicas of physical aircraft that simulate real-world conditions. Engineers can test modifications in software environments, iterating designs rapidly. This approach, detailed in BAA Training’s blog on 2024 trends, has led to lighter, more efficient airframes, contributing to the industry’s push toward sustainability.

However, this reliance on computers isn’t without challenges. Recent IT meltdowns, like the Alaska Airlines grounding in late 2025, underscore vulnerabilities. As reported by NPR, these incidents highlight the need for robust backups and cybersecurity measures in an increasingly digital ecosystem.

On the innovation front, computers have enabled advancements in electric and hybrid propulsion. Simulations optimize battery placements and power distribution, paving the way for greener flights. The Transport & Environment analysis warns that without continued innovation, decarbonization goals could falter, emphasizing the role of computational modeling in breakthroughs.

Safety Enhancements Through Computational Intelligence

Safety has been the biggest beneficiary of computational integration. Systems like the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) use radar and algorithms to prevent mid-air collisions, a technology that has saved countless lives since its 1990s rollout. Enhanced ground proximity warning systems (EGPWS) provide terrain awareness, further reducing accident rates.

In private aviation, emerging standards by 2030 may mandate predictive tech features, as per News Channel 3-12. These include AI-driven diagnostics that foresee failures, shifting from reactive to proactive safety protocols.

The military sector has driven many of these advancements. The U.S. Air Force’s upgrades, discussed in Simple Flying, balance legacy fleets with cutting-edge computing, incorporating AI for threat detection and autonomous operations.

Industry-Wide Transformations: Efficiency and Economics

Economically, computers have reshaped airline operations. Revenue management systems use algorithms to optimize ticket pricing, maximizing profits amid fluctuating demand. This data-driven approach, evolving since the 1980s, has made air travel more accessible while boosting carrier revenues.

Training has also been revolutionized. Flight simulators, powered by advanced graphics and physics engines, allow pilots to practice scenarios without risking lives or equipment. AOPA’s 1992 article on computers in aviation foresaw this trend, which has only intensified with virtual reality integrations.

Moreover, the push for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) relies on computational modeling to assess viability. Innovations like those in BAA Training’s list of game-changers include computer-optimized engines that reduce emissions, aligning with global environmental mandates.

Challenges and Future Horizons in Aviation Computing

Despite triumphs, the integration of computers brings hurdles. Cybersecurity threats loom large, with potential hacks disrupting critical systems. Industry insiders note that as planes become more connected, safeguarding digital infrastructure is paramount, echoing concerns from the NPR report on system failures.

Looking ahead, quantum computing could further transform aviation by solving complex optimization problems instantaneously, from route planning to material science for lighter composites. X posts from aviation engineers highlight ongoing developments, such as variable camber wings reprogrammed in flight, a concept Airbus explored in the 1980s.

The Boeing 737 MAX saga illustrates both potential and pitfalls. The MCAS system, introduced to handle engine placement changes, relied on software to maintain stability but led to tragedies when flaws emerged. A 2025 X post from an aircraft maintenance engineer explained how this small change amplified the need for rigorous software validation.

Pioneering Autonomy: Toward Pilotless Skies

Autonomy is the next frontier. Companies like Boeing and Airbus are testing unmanned cargo flights, leveraging AI for decision-making. The Amprius Technologies piece on future safety underscores how technology ensures reliable electric aircraft operations.

In urban air mobility, eVTOL vehicles depend on computers for navigation in crowded skies. These advancements promise to decongest roads and revolutionize short-haul travel, backed by simulations that predict traffic patterns.

Yet, regulatory bodies must keep pace. The FAA and EASA are updating frameworks to certify AI systems, ensuring they meet safety thresholds without stifling innovation.

Global Impacts and Ethical Considerations

On a global scale, computational advancements have democratized aviation in developing regions. Low-cost carriers use data analytics to expand routes, connecting remote areas. However, this raises ethical questions about job displacement, as automation reduces the need for human crews.

Diversity in aviation benefits from tech, with simulators making training more inclusive. Women and underrepresented groups gain access to high-fidelity practice, fostering a broader talent pool.

As we stand on the cusp of 2030, the fusion of computers and aviation continues to evolve. From the modular designs of the 747, analogized in an X post to software architecture, to AI-piloted emergencies, the trajectory is clear: computers aren’t just tools; they’re the very fabric of modern flight.

Sustaining Momentum in Technological Flight

To sustain this momentum, investment in R&D is crucial. Governments and private firms are pouring resources into next-gen computing, like edge AI for real-time decisions without cloud reliance.

Additionally, the deadline for the intermediate target of 50% reduced GHG emissions was changed from 2030 to 2035.
Neste's conventional fuel refinery, located in Porvoo, Finland, was supposed to be turned into a renewable refining hub by 2035, and this played an essential part in Neste's climate strategy.
Right now, Neste's SAF production alone reaches up to 1.5 million tons per year, and is expected to grow to 2.2 million tons in just two years from now.
Multiple operators around the world have started to incorporate SAF, either from Neste or other suppliers, into their regular flight operations.","Neste's initial, and by its own words ""ambitious"" climate goal was to achieve full carbon-neutral production by 2035. The revised target looks significantly different, both in terms of time and percentage; Neste is now aiming for an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. Additionally, the deadline for the intermediate target of 50% reduced GHG emissions was changed from 2030 to 2035.

In short, the main reason for this revised target is the financial cost. Neste's conventional fuel refinery, located in Porvoo, Finland, was supposed to be turned into a renewable refining hub by 2035, and this played an essential part in Neste's climate strategy. Earlier this year, it announced that this transformation had to be delayed, which also triggered the need to reassess the company's climate strategy and set new, more realistic targets.

The Finnish green fuel company has already pumped more than $2 billion into expanding its renewable refinery in Rotterdam. The transformation of the Porvoo facility will also continue, but it will take longer than initially expected.

So far, Neste has reduced GHG emissions in its operations by 24% compared to 2019 levels. This is an important achievement, considering that production of renewable fuels continued to grow exponentially during this time, and it only keeps getting bigger. By 2027, Neste expects to produce 6.8 million tons of renewable fuels per year.

Neste currently has active refineries on three continents, all using waste, residues, and various raw materials as primary resources. The Neste MY SAF is made from residues such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste, and is currently certified to be used in blends of up to 50% with conventional jet fuel for commercial use.

Right now, Neste's SAF production alone reaches up to 1.5 million tons per year, and is expected to grow to 2.2 million tons in just two years from now. Multiple operators around the world have started to incorporate SAF, either from Neste or other suppliers, into their regular flight operations. Most recently, Neste announced that its cooperation with Cathay Pacific will expand the use of SAF in three major regions: the US, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/worlds-top-saf-producer-revises-its-own-climate-goals-263408_1.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 06:56:36.360534

The company has developed a half-scale prototype, named Sylla SYL-X1, marking a transition from digital design and lab work to physical validation.

With a wingspan of 7.5 metres, the Sylla SYL-X1 is positioned as the country’s largest privately developed eVTOL prototype at this scale. Sarla Aviation said the aircraft was developed in around nine months, with relatively modest capital expenditure compared with many global eVTOL programmes. The current testing phase focuses on evaluating structural behaviour, propulsion system integration, and safety architecture before moving towards full-scale development.

From virtual design to physical validation

The prototype is fully electric and is being used to validate core engineering assumptions. According to the company, the production aircraft will adopt a hybrid configuration to enable longer-range operations. Sarla Aviation plans to retain the ‘Shunya’ branding introduced earlier this year, with a suffix for the 15-metre full-scale aircraft currently under development.

Over the past nine months, the company’s engineering team has expanded from just over ten people to nearly 70, reflecting the increasing complexity of the programme as it enters a more capital- and manufacturing-intensive phase. To date, Sarla Aviation has raised $13 million to support its first air taxi project.

Manufacturing plans and regional partnerships

Sarla Aviation’s leadership brings experience from both automotive and aviation sectors. Co-founder and CEO Adrian Schmidt has worked with global carmakers and air taxi developers, while co-founder and CTO Rakesh Gaonkar brings extensive automotive design expertise across multiple international brands.

Commenting on the milestone, Gaonkar said the testing phase reflects a focus on durability and engineering discipline rather than speed to market. The company is also laying early groundwork for deployment. It has signed memoranda of understanding with the governments of Goa and Karnataka to explore potential air taxi operations, including tourism and city-to-airport connectivity.

The six-seat Shunya air taxi concept is designed to reach speeds of up to 250 km/h, with electric batteries supporting regional routes and a sustainable aviation fuel system extending range for longer missions. The production aircraft is planned to be manufactured at a new facility in Thimmasamudram, Andhra Pradesh, signalling Sarla Aviation’s intent to build domestic aerospace manufacturing capability alongside product development.",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/12/30/sarla-aviation.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 08:57:05.903319

Countries are investing heavily in infrastructure, technology, and sustainability to meet the growing demands of a post-pandemic world while solidifying the region’s place as a major player in global aviation.

Expansion of Air Routes: The Rise of New Middle East Hubs

As Middle Eastern nations continue to establish themselves as key connectors between East and West, new air routes are emerging, especially for travelers looking to connect between Asia, Europe, and North America. Major cities like Dubai, Doha, and Riyadh are becoming more accessible through expanded international flight networks.

This year, UAE-based Emirates Airlines plans to increase its routes connecting to Asia, Qatar Airways aims to enhance its European presence, while Saudi Arabia is working to open new markets across the African continent. The development of new direct flights has resulted in significantly reduced travel time between key cities, making the Middle East an increasingly attractive hub for both business and leisure travelers.

The Role of Sustainability in Middle East Aviation

As the world moves toward more sustainable travel solutions, the Middle East is stepping up efforts to improve environmental sustainability within its aviation sector. Governments in the region, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have committed to carbon-neutral aviation goals by 2030. Airlines are transitioning to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and airports are incorporating energy-efficient technologies to support green travel.

For travelers, these sustainability initiatives offer a future of eco-friendly flights and reduced carbon footprints. Airports across the Middle East are making strides to ensure that their infrastructure supports green travel, from solar-powered terminals in Abu Dhabi to the introduction of electric aircraft by the UAE’s flagship carrier, Emirates.

What Should Travelers Expect from the New Aviation Landscape?

Increased Comfort and Efficiency: Middle Eastern airlines are investing in modernizing aircraft interiors, ensuring travelers enjoy superior comfort with state-of-the-art entertainment systems, premium dining options, and spacious seating arrangements. With improved connectivity between major hubs, travelers can expect a more seamless journey, whether for business or pleasure.

Competitive Airfares: With the increasing competition among airlines in the Middle East, travelers can anticipate affordable airfares for long-haul flights. Lower-cost carriers like flynas and SalamAir are contributing to more options for budget-conscious travelers.

Cultural Integration and Tourism Boost: Countries in the Middle East are now positioning themselves as key tourism destinations, offering visitors unique experiences. From the luxurious resorts of Dubai to the historic landmarks of Riyadh, travelers will have access to richer cultural experiences before and after their flights. Tourism boards are focusing on promoting not just the cities but also desert safaris, beach destinations, and the emerging leisure hubs like Muscat and Abu Dhabi.

Technology Innovations: Expect to see the implementation of advanced biometric screening and AI-powered check-ins, ensuring that travelers’ journeys are fast and secure. As digital innovations continue to shape the travel experience, Middle Eastern airports are leveraging these technologies to make air travel smoother and more efficient.

Enhancing Airport Infrastructure: The Middle East Leads with Modernity

In response to the surge in demand, several airports in the Middle East are undergoing massive renovations or new constructions. Dubai International Airport is expanding to accommodate a higher volume of passengers, with an emphasis on creating an immersive experience through technology and design. Similarly, Qatar’s Hamad International Airport continues to invest in state-of-the-art terminals, while Saudi Arabia’s King Abdulaziz International Airport is set to become one of the largest airports in the world by 2030.

For travelers, this means quicker connections, luxurious amenities, and expanded duty-free options. Airports in the region are positioning themselves not just as transportation hubs but as gateways to a world of culture, innovation, and leisure.

What Travelers Can Do to Take Advantage of 2026’s Aviation Boom

Book Early for the Best Fares: With new routes launching and airlines competing for passengers, booking flights early in 2026 will offer travelers the best prices and seat availability.

Stay Updated on New Destinations: Keep an eye on the launch of new routes, especially those connecting less-traveled destinations with the Middle East. This will open new avenues for leisure and business travelers.

Embrace the Eco-Friendly Shift: As more airlines adopt sustainable practices, look out for green travel packages and eco-conscious tour operators offering sustainable travel experiences.

Explore More Regional Hubs: Travelers can take advantage of the growing network of regional hubs within the Middle East to make more efficient connections and explore new destinations.

Grounded in real-world constraints – from financing to reliability – the continent is combining green hydrogen, renewables, natural gas, electrification and targeted investment to lower carbon intensity without slowing development.

Green Hydrogen Gains Momentum

Green hydrogen is increasingly recognized as a practical decarbonization tool, particularly in refining, where it can replace grey hydrogen used in hydrotreating and hydrocracking. This allows operators to reduce emissions while maintaining essential refinery operations. The HySHiFT project led by Sasol demonstrates this application, integrating green hydrogen into Fischer-Tropsch facilities to produce sustainable aviation fuel via a 200 MW electrolyzer at its Secunda plant.

Governments are also laying the groundwork to scale green hydrogen beyond domestic use. In January 2025, ministers from Algeria, Tunisia, Austria, Germany and Italy formalized a declaration advancing the 3,300-km SoutH2 Corridor, positioning Algeria as a key supplier to Europe. Angola is pursuing export-focused green hydrogen as well; Sonangol has confirmed the country’s first green hydrogen project, expected to produce 400,000 tons of hydrogen annually from 2027, supporting the country’s goal of reaching 70% renewable capacity by 2035.

Renewables at the Asset Level

​​Renewable energy is increasingly integrated directly into upstream operations, reducing reliance on diesel and minimizing flaring. Hybrid power systems combining renewables and gas help operators cut Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions while improving reliability. At Uganda’s Tilenga oil field, associated gas separated at the central processing facility is used to generate the electricity needed for processing operations, reducing flaring and external power dependence.

Natural Gas as a Transition Enabler

Natural gas remains a central pillar of Africa’s decarbonization strategy, particularly as a replacement for diesel or oil in power generation. Switching to gas turbines, often combined with renewable power, reduces emissions at compressor stations and production facilities. In Nigeria, a dedicated upstream facility is being developed to supply gas from the Iseni field to the Dangote Fertilizer and Petrochemical Plant – an initiative aligned with the government’s “Decade of Gas” strategy to strengthen domestic industrial energy supply.

Gas is also being deployed at the system level through flare reduction and commercialization programs. In December 2025, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission issued permits to 28 companies under the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialization Program, converting flared gas into a commercial resource. The initiative is expected to cut 6 million tons of emissions per year and create up to 100,000 jobs, turning an environmental liability into an economic opportunity.

Technology Driving Lower-Carbon Operations

Innovative technologies and low-emission design are shaping Africa’s energy transition. Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) is gaining traction as a way to reduce emissions from large gas developments while maintaining production. In Libya, Eni and the National Oil Corporation are advancing the Structures A&E gas project, including a CCUS facility at the Mellitah Complex, scheduled for completion in December 2027.

Electrification is extending offshore as well. New FPSOs, like the Agogo FPSO in Angola, are designed with fully electric topside and marine systems, reflecting a growing shift toward lower-emissions offshore production.

Financing the Transition

Scaling these pathways requires long-term, blended financing. Multilateral institutions are increasingly bridging gaps. The Climate Investment Funds selected Egypt, Namibia and South Africa to participate in a $1 billion industrial decarbonization program, alongside countries including Brazil, Mexico and Turkey, accelerating low-carbon technologies while prioritizing workforce reskilling and community protections.

In Egypt, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is supporting corporate-level decarbonization. A $25 million facility for Arabian Cement Company will fund a hydrogen injection system to reduce emissions by an estimated 120,000 tons per year, illustrating how targeted investments can deliver substantial reductions while advancing national decarbonization goals. Together, these initiatives show that financing – not technology alone – often determines whether decarbonization moves from pilot to scale.",https://ecpbucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/27090934/Decarbonization-initiatives.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 03:56:31.154141

IATA expects fuel to account for 26.4% of airline operating costs in 2025, and it continues to describe fuel as typically 25% to 30% of total expenses, illustrating the importance of efficiency gains for both the bottom line and the environment.

Aviation’s climate impact is also under sharper scrutiny. The International Energy Agency estimates aviation accounted for 2.5% of global energy-related CO2 emissions in 2023, with emissions approaching 950 Mt CO2 as traffic recovered. Against that backdrop, the UN’s net-zero coalition messaging has been blunt that, to keep 1.5°C within reach, emissions need to fall by 45% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.

Why ramp decisions matter

The industry often frames decarbonisation around sustainable aviation fuel, new aircraft and air traffic modernisation, but operational improvements remain one of the most immediate levers.

ICAO’s environmental reporting describes “operational improvements” as a wedge in its basket of measures that can reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions across aircraft operator and airport activities, including ground operator processes and flight planning.

That is where pre-flight ground operations come into focus, particularly weight discipline and load management. These are not glamorous initiatives, but they are scalable, measurable and can be integrated into standard procedures without waiting for new fuels or airframes. In a region where widebody utilisation is high and turnaround windows are tight, small changes replicated across thousands of sectors can add up to material savings.

Centre of gravity optimisation

Load controllers already operate within strict safety limits, yet the centre of gravity still influences drag and, therefore, fuel burn. Airbus summarises the principle simply in its fuel economy guidance, stating, “For most Airbus aircraft, an aft CG position saves fuel,” linking the benefit to reduced trim drag and the avoidance of excess weight.

The physics becomes especially relevant on longer sectors. A Delft University thesis examining CG shift and trim drag derived that, on a 9,300 km flight, roughly 780 kg of fuel could be saved when the trim drag coefficient decreases by 1%, while also acknowledging the operational limits that constrain how much CG can be shifted through loading.

For operators, the practical takeaway is not to chase an idealised aft CG at all costs, but to build a repeatable loading philosophy that consistently avoids forward-heavy outcomes when alternatives exist. That demands tight coordination between load planning and operational realities such as late bags, cargo constraints, and hold access sequencing.

Weight and consumables

Weight is often discussed as a design issue, but ramp processes determine how much weight is carried unnecessarily on each departure. Potable water is a clear example because uplift practices can drift toward conservatism, especially when multiple flight durations and passenger loads share similar catering patterns.

OpenAirlines, a fuel-efficiency software provider, provides a practical illustration of the cost of excess uplift: “500kg of potable water unused during a flight of 9 hours will cost 150kg of additional fuel to carry to the destination.” Satair, an Airbus services business, describes how some airlines have installed standpipes to cap potable water levels, noting that limiting a tank from 60 gallons to 40 gallons “can save around 33% of the weight.”

These numbers matter because they translate a routine provisioning choice into a fuel and emissions consequence. The most effective programmes treat water uplift like a variable, not a constant, using route history, passenger count, flight time and uplift reliability to set controlled buffers rather than defaulting to full tanks.

Lighter ULDs create savings

Unit Load Devices are another underused lever because they sit at the intersection of safety, handling and weight. Even small reductions per unit scale rapidly when multiplied across a widebody belly operation or a cargo-heavy passenger network.

Swiss WorldCargo quantified the impact of a fleetwide container changeover in 2025, noting that newer containers have a “reduction of the tare weight of 22 kg per AKE type.” IATA’s life cycle assessment guidance for ULDs also notes the trade-offs, but confirms the core benefit that “a lighter composite ULD may reduce fuel burn and, therefore, climate change impacts.”

For Middle East carriers with high utilisation and strong cargo mix, ULD tare reduction can be one of the rare initiatives that improves fuel efficiency without adding process complexity to the aircraft. The work is front-loaded into procurement, repair capability and handling discipline, then quietly delivers on every sector.

Last minute changes and fuel burn

Load and trim accuracy can be eroded by late operational events. Last-minute changes are a normal part of airline operations, but their impact on weight and balance calculations is often reflected in flight plan conservatism.

When late bags, cargo swaps, or passenger changes are not cleanly integrated into the final numbers, the system tends to compensate by increasing fuel carriage, either directly or indirectly, because uncertainty pushes planners toward buffers.

This is where the operational discipline of reissuing accurate figures becomes a fuel strategy rather than just a compliance task. The goal is not to reduce safety margins. It is to prevent avoidable margin stacking, where small unknowns across multiple categories compound into unnecessary uplift.

Removing dead load

The simplest form of weight reduction is not improved loading, but not carrying what is not needed. Many fleets carry deadload items for redundancy or convenience, even when operational practice and station support have evolved. Spare wheels, tyres and non-essential equipment are easy to justify individually, but they become expensive when carried across every flight.

Airbus’s fuel economy guidance is explicit on the principle, stating, “Excess weight costs fuel. Minimise zero fuel weight and embarked fuel.” In practice, deadload reviews require cross-functional agreement among engineering, flight operations, and ground services, because operational risk tolerance varies by network and station capabilities. Still, this is one of the few initiatives that can deliver savings immediately once the policy is updated.

These ground-operation levers do not replace sustainable aviation fuel or new aircraft, but they complement them. Reuters reporting in December 2025 captured the industry’s concern that SAF supply remains far below what targets imply, with IATA projecting that only 0.8% of total jet fuel consumption could be met by SAF availability in 2026. That reality makes operational savings even more valuable because they can be deployed now across the existing fleet.

For airlines, the practical path is to industrialise the basics. Standardise loading targets where feasible, use route-level potable water ratios, procure lighter ULDs at scale, and treat flight plan revision after last-minute changes as a fuel control point, not a paperwork step. For regulators and airport stakeholders, the opportunity is to support consistent processes that reduce ground delays and make accurate weight finalisation easier, because predictability is a fuel strategy in itself.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/12/30/Untitled-design-2025-12-30T104821.072.png,N,,2025-12-30 03:56:35.517876

2025 saw a number of high profile deployments of UK military forces both close to home and across the globe, including the eight month long voyage of HMS Prince of Wales and its carrier strike group to the Indo-Pacific and back, reinforcement of NATO’s Eastern borders amid airspace incursions by Russian drones, and massive multinational exercises involving thousands of personnel. At the same time, British forces have continued long-standing operations in the Middle East battling some of the remaining remnants of ISIS and supporting regional security.

Photographers from the Ministry of Defence, British Army, Royal Air Force, and Royal Navy – trained by the multi-service Defence School of Photography (DSoP) at RAF Cosford – are an almost constant presence wherever British military personnel travel. DSoP additionally offers training courses for other personnel whose role may at times benefit from them having a certain level of photographic knowledge and ability.

Beyond their public and media relations value, the images captured by these photographers are important historical records and, in certain situations, a trained photographers’ skills in operational situations can be invaluable for intelligence gathering purposes – for example, when Royal Navy ships tasked to shadow or surveil foreign military vessels. As the Ministry of Defence’s press release reads: “Behind every image that is captured is an individual who is first and foremost a soldier, sailor, or aviator, and secondarily a skilled photographer. They deploy not only with their cameras but also their rifles.”

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) releases its yearly image selection each December, both showcasing the work of its photographers as well as of the UK Armed Forces as a whole. Sir Rich Knighton, Chief of the Defence Staff, said: “The Best of Defence Imagery 2025 reflects the contribution our armed forces make to society and our presence across the world. These images show our Armed Forces ready for a new era of threat, combining conventional strength with innovation, operating with allies, and putting people at the heart of Defence. They provide an essential visual account of how we are keeping the UK secure at home and strong abroad.”

Operation Highmast

The most high-profile mission carried out by the UK’s armed forces this year was undoubtedly Operation Highmast, otherwise known as Carrier Strike Group 25 (CSG 25). We, and other outlets, reported on this eight month deployment extensively throughout its course. Over the 44,000 nautical miles sailed, it saw a record set for the highest number of F-35Bs ever deployed on board a warship, the first ever cross-decking exercise by a British jet onto a Japanese naval vessel, the first overnight visit by a British Prime Minister to a Royal Navy ship in almost 60 years, and the maiden UK carrier deployment of uncrewed aerial systems ahead of plans for a full scale hybrid air wing in the coming years.

Wildcat HMA2 helicopters were kept on 24/7 alert armed with Martlet lightweight multirole missiles as the strike group transited the Red Sea, ready to launch and defend the carrier and its escorts from the threat of attack by aerial or waterborne drones and cruise missiles. The RAF additionally deployed reinforcements of Voyager aerial refueling aircraft to RAF Akrotiri, which would support Akrotiri based Typhoons or F-35Bs from the carrier itself, as well as P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft to add to the CSG’s defensive shield.

An extra RC-135 Rivet Joint was also deployed to Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, joining one RAF airframe already on station there. The additional aircraft, based on the timing of the deployment and its return, was likely tasked with gathering intelligence which could be used to ensure the carrier’s security in the region.

Later in the voyage, the CSG undertook joint exercises and defence engagements with a number of nations along the route. This included Exercise Bersama Lima in Southeast Asia, Exercise Talisman Sabre off Australia, Exercise Konkan in the Indian Ocean, and, upon returning to the Mediterranean, Exercise Falcon Strike.

Eastern Sentry

Royal Air Force Typhoons have been a regular presence in Baltic skies for many years as part of the NATO Baltic Air Policing mission. As the number of aircraft deployed on these rotations has increased in the previous few years – labelled Enhanced Air Policing – the RAF’s presence has also increased. Simultaneous deployments are now maintained by multiple nations at multiple bases in the region. Alongside the nations covered by the original BAP presence – Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia – Enhanced Air Policing deployments have also been made to Poland and Romania.

On Sept. 12, 2025, NATO commenced Operation Eastern Sentry – intended to bolster the alliance’s capacity to respond to and deter increasing provocations by Russian forces. It resulted from the invocation of NATO’s Article 4 by Poland several days prior in response to a massive breach of its airspace by Russian drones. Article 4 provides for a consultation by member states in response to a situation that threatens the territorial integrity, political independence or security of a NATO member. It had previously been triggered by a number of European nations after Russia’s full scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Shortly after Eastern Sentry kicked off, patrols over Poland by RAF Typhoons launched from UK bases began.

Public Occasions

Throughout the year, the three branches of the UK’s armed forces undertake a variety of public engagements to mark national and local celebrations and commemorations. With June 2025 came the official birthday of King Charles III, which, when weather permits, is marked by a flypast over Buckingham Palace after the traditional Trooping the Colour parades.

The Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team (RAFAT), most commonly known as the Red Arrows, are stalwarts of the UK airshow scene along with the RAF’s Typhoon display team. Together they entertained spectators at the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) as well as the RAF Cosford Air Show.

For 2025’s RIAT display, the Red Arrows utilised sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, for their jet engines as well as a vegetable oil-based biofuel in their smoke pods. This followed extensive trials with the new fuels, and was the first time SAF had been used for a full Red Arrows display. With many event organisers, even those in charge of Formula One, becoming wary of how flypasts and displays by fuel-hungry high performance jet aircraft could impact their sustainability credentials, this will likely be beneficial in ensuring the display team’s future schedules remain fully booked. In a wider strategic sense, cutting reliance on crude oil products is an important step in reducing dependency on foreign supplies from far overseas that could be cut off by war or diplomatic disputes.

Global Operations

As seen with Operation Highmast, personnel and equipment from the UK’s armed forces frequently travel across the globe and can be seen in a wide range of locations. Images in the collection span from the remote South Georgia and Sandwich Islands in the far reaches of the southern hemisphere, to the chilling conditions in Bardufoss, Norway, the dry deserts of Nevada, USA, and the sun-kissed waters of the Timor Sea.

Bardufoss in northern Norway is used by the UK’s armed forces routinely for cold-weather training. Operation Clockwork, an annual exercise, sees a selection of helicopters deploy to the far north with supporting ground forces to ensure all involved are ready and able to operate in temperatures as low as -30C and amid arctic blizzards, storms, and thick snowfall. Though cold weather and snow can be found in the UK, it is much less predictable and difficult to schedule a regular exercise around.

RAF Typhoons have, since becoming the mainstay of the UK’s combat air fleet, been regular attendees of the U.S. Air Force’s famous Red Flag exercises at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. 2025 was no exception, with the RAF dispatching eight Typhoon FGR4s along with a Voyager refueling tanker across the Atlantic to take part.

Often overshadowed by the Falkland Islands through which it was formerly governed, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands lie just over 800 miles to the east of the Falklands and were, too, involved in the 1982 conflict. Prior to Argentina’s invasion of the Falkland Islands at the beginning of April 1982, Argentinians claiming to be scrap metal merchants landed on South Georgia and laid claim to an abandoned whaling outpost. An Argentinian submarine, the Santa Fe, was disabled by Royal Navy helicopters on Apr. 25 while on a supply run to South Georgia, and the territory was fully surrendered to British forces the following day.

While the territory has no permanent residents, a research station is maintained by the British Antarctic Survey and the surrounding waters are well used for fishing. British military forces stationed on the Falklands or in the South Atlantic pay regular visits to ensure its security, as well as assist civilian agencies with scientific research and environmental monitoring.

International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling, is ending the year with its share price trading closer to the upper half of its recent range, but still far from its pre?pandemic cruising altitude. The stock has spent recent sessions oscillating around the mid?single digits in euro terms, reflecting a market that acknowledges genuine operational progress yet remains wary of fuel costs, consumer softness and geopolitics.

Over the past five trading days, the shares have edged higher, mirroring broader European airline peers, as oil prices eased and investors rotated back into cyclicals. On a 90?day view, the trend has been modestly positive: after a choppy autumn marked by macro?driven selloffs, the stock has quietly rebuilt altitude, climbing back from its quarterly lows. The 52?week range tells the broader story. IAG has bounced between a depressed floor and a considerably higher ceiling over the past year, trading well above its lows but still shy of its high watermark for the period. That positioning, combined with recent price action, points to a cautiously bullish sentiment: not euphoria, but a willingness to pay up for an airline group that has repaired its balance sheet and is printing solid profits.

The market mood is still far from complacent. Every flare?up in the Middle East, every jitter in jet fuel markets, every whisper about consumer belt?tightening shows up instantly in the stock’s intraday swings. But for now, the aggregate picture is one of guarded optimism, supported by strong transatlantic demand and corporate travel that has finally come out of its post?pandemic funk.

Latest corporate and investor information from International Airlines Group

One-Year Investment Performance

Investors who backed International Airlines Group a year ago have, on balance, been rewarded, though not with the kind of windfall that makes headlines. Based on closing prices from a year earlier, the stock has delivered a mid?to?high single?digit percentage gain, once currency effects and normal volatility are smoothed out. That translates into a performance that roughly tracks, or modestly outpaces, some European airline peers, but lags the kind of high?beta rally that more speculative travel names enjoyed at the peak of the reopening trade.

In practical terms, an investor who bought €10,000 worth of IAG shares a year ago would now be sitting on a few hundred euros of paper profit, assuming dividends are minimal and not reinvested. It is the kind of return profile that feels solid rather than spectacular: enough to validate the thesis that the group’s multi?brand, multi?hub structure would benefit from the recovery in long?haul and premium traffic, but not enough to erase the memory of the deep drawdowns endured during the pandemic years. The trajectory, though, is what matters. The stock’s path over the year has been a series of sharp climbs on strong quarterly earnings, followed by pullbacks whenever markets began to worry about recession, wars or higher fuel bills.

For long?term shareholders, the message is clear. The period of existential worry for IAG seems firmly in the rearview mirror; the question now is not survival, but whether a leaner cost base and capacity discipline can deliver a structurally higher earnings power that justifies a rerating from today’s still?discounted multiples.

Recent Catalysts and News

Earlier this week, sentiment toward International Airlines Group was helped by yet another indication that travel demand is proving sticky, even as consumers face higher interest rates and inflation fatigue. Industry data on European passenger volumes showed robust load factors on key routes into and out of London and Madrid, with transatlantic and Latin American corridors particularly strong. For IAG, which leans heavily on its British Airways and Iberia long?haul franchises, that confirmation of demand resilience supports management’s guidance for healthy yields into the new year.

Recently, the group also remained in focus over its long?running effort to acquire Spanish carrier Air Europa. Regulatory processes and remedies continue to shape the narrative. Investors have been watching closely for signals from Brussels about competition concerns on Iberian routes. The strategic logic for IAG is compelling: folding Air Europa into the portfolio would deepen its Madrid hub, build scale on Latin American routes and strengthen its position against low?cost rivals. But the deal’s drawn?out nature has become a source of deal fatigue for some shareholders. Any definitive progress — even in the form of tough but manageable remedies — could act as a meaningful catalyst for the stock.

At the same time, capacity and cost discipline remain under the microscope. In recent commentary, IAG highlighted ongoing efforts to mitigate cost pressures through fleet renewal and productivity improvements. Deliveries of more fuel?efficient aircraft, including Airbus A350s and A320neos, are gradually changing the cost structure, while digital initiatives in operations and distribution continue to promise incremental savings. Markets have started to price in that operational progress, but investors want to see it consistently flow through to margins, particularly in the seasonally weaker winter quarters.

Wall Street Verdict & Price Targets

Across the sell?side, the tone on International Airlines Group is more positive than not. Over the past several weeks, a series of analyst notes from major European and U.S. investment banks have broadly reiterated constructive views on the shares. The consensus rating sits in the ""Buy"" to ""Overweight"" bracket, with a minority of firms preferring a more cautious ""Hold"" stance. The core bullish argument is straightforward: IAG trades on earnings and cash?flow multiples that still imply a hefty discount to pre?pandemic norms, even though traffic and profitability are much closer to those earlier baselines.

Recent price target updates from large houses such as JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Barclays and others cluster in a range that implies double?digit percentage upside from current trading levels. While individual numbers differ, the median target effectively assumes that the market will reward the company for continued deleveraging, steady capacity growth in profitable segments, and the successful bedding?in of fleet renewal. Analysts with the highest targets lean on a scenario in which premium travel demand remains structurally stronger than before the pandemic, particularly on North Atlantic routes where BA and Iberia enjoy strong market positions.

The skeptics, reflected in the ""Hold"" cohort, emphasise macro and sector?specific risks. They warn that airlines’ earnings power remains extremely sensitive to oil prices, wage settlements and potential demand shocks. For IAG in particular, exposure to the UK consumer — still wrestling with the aftershocks of higher mortgage costs and fiscal tightening — is a recurring concern. A soft patch in discretionary spending could weigh on short?haul leisure bookings and cabin?mix dynamics, trimming yields even if planes remain relatively full. For now, though, the numerical balance of Wall Street opinion tilts to the upside: upside?skewed price targets and predominantly positive ratings sum to a broadly bullish verdict.

Future Prospects and Strategy

Looking ahead, the investment case for International Airlines Group hinges on three strategic pillars: disciplined capacity management, portfolio diversification and balance sheet repair. On capacity, the group has repeatedly signalled that it will prioritise profitable growth over market share grabs. That is particularly important on short?haul European routes, where hyper?competitive low?cost carriers can pressure fares. IAG’s strategy is to lean into its strengths: premium cabins, corporate contracts and long?haul connectivity from key hubs at London Heathrow and Madrid Barajas.

Its multi?brand portfolio — British Airways and Iberia at the full?service end, Vueling and LEVEL in the low?cost and leisure space, and Aer Lingus straddling both transatlantic value and regional connectivity — offers a natural hedge. When UK corporate travel ebbs, Spanish leisure might surprise to the upside; when Europe softens, transatlantic or Latin American traffic can pick up the slack. That geographic and segment diversification is one reason analysts increasingly view IAG as structurally less volatile than monoline carriers, even if the group retains all the cyclicality inherent in aviation.

The second pillar is fleet and sustainability strategy. Newer, more fuel?efficient aircraft not only lower operating costs but also reduce carbon intensity per passenger kilometre — an increasingly material factor as regulators and customers put airlines under an environmental microscope. IAG has been among the more vocal European groups on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) commitments, placing multi?year offtake agreements and signalling a willingness to co?invest in supply. While the economics of SAF remain challenging, early movers may win regulatory goodwill and brand advantage. For investors, a credible decarbonisation path can reduce the long?term policy and reputational risks that hang over the sector.

Finally, there is the balance sheet. Years of pandemic?era losses left IAG with elevated debt, but improving cash generation is gradually turning that story around. Management has articulated a clear deleveraging trajectory, and free cash flow from strong summer seasons is now flowing toward debt reduction and selective investment rather than simple survival. The moment the market becomes confident that leverage metrics are back within pre?COVID comfort zones, conversations about capital returns — dividends and buybacks — will likely come back onto the table. That, in turn, could act as a powerful rerating catalyst for a stock still widely seen as undervalued relative to its normalised earnings power.

Risks remain impossible to ignore. A spike in oil prices, renewed industrial action at key hubs, or a sharper?than?expected downturn in European consumption could all derail the recovery trajectory. Geopolitical disruptions to airspace or tourism flows, whether in the Middle East, Eastern Europe or elsewhere, could also hit certain parts of IAG’s network disproportionately. Yet for investors willing to stomach volatility, the risk?reward balance looks more balanced than it has in years. International Airlines Group is no longer fighting for survival; it is competing for margin, market share in lucrative segments, and investor confidence.

Whether the next phase of this story is a steady climb or another bout of turbulence will depend on execution as much as on macroeconomics. If management can deliver on its promises of disciplined growth, cost efficiency and a credible path to lower carbon flying, the share price may have more altitude left to gain than the last year’s modest appreciation suggests.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405023_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 00:58:20.839471

Using visual media and open discussions, facilitators guided students to understand how simple actions such as throwing waste in the proper place can help prevent larger environmental problems. The students showed high enthusiasm during the session; many eagerly answered questions, shared their personal experiences, and demonstrated strong curiosity about the environmental issues presented.

In addition to the educational session, the program included a poster-making competition designed to reinforce the students’ understanding of the topics discussed. During the activity, students expressed their knowledge of waste management and tidal flooding creatively through drawings and colors. They appeared enthusiastic and imaginative as they colored and illustrated their posters..

The students’ excitement grew even further during an interactive outdoor activity. Divided into small groups, they participated in a “clean-up challenge,” designed to cultivate environmental awareness while practicing waste collection and sorting. The atmosphere was lively, with students running enthusiastically, collaborating with teammates, and competing to become the quickest and most thorough group in cleaning the school area.

Through this collaboration, the organizers hope that students gain meaningful insights into the importance of keeping their surroundings clean and understanding how it relates to the risk of tidal flooding. “We hope this collaboration strengthens the relationship between student organizations, and that the volunteers who went to the field can truly see, hear, and feel the real conditions happening today.

The company’s Prime Air unit will no longer pursue a commercial drone delivery service in Italy, where it previously announced plans to launch by late 2024. Reuters reported that the move came as a surprise to Italy’s civil aviation regulator, ENAC.

A Prime Air spokesperson told FLYING that the company remains committed to the U.K.—the other international market it had aimed to enter last year. In 2025, its drones began serving customers in Waco and San Antonio, Texas; Pontiac, Michigan; and other U.S. locations. The company plans to announce new U.S. and international services soon, it said.

“Despite positive engagement and progress with Italian aerospace regulators, the broader business regulatory framework in the country does not, at this time, support our longer-term objectives for this program,” the spokesperson said. “Our drone delivery projects in the U.S. and U.K. continue positively, with test flights and commercial deliveries proving successful and well-received by customers.”

Those operations have not been universally embraced.

In College Station, Texas, residents complained about noise from the company’s MK27-2 drone—which they compared to chain saws, leaf blowers, and hives of bees—and pushed back on a proposed expansion. Prime Air agreed to limit operations in the city to four per hour and told residents it would not renew the lease on its local drone delivery hub. It officially ceased operations in College Station, one of its two initial U.S. launch markets, in August.

“We were happy to have Amazon and its drone service in our community,” said College Station Mayor John Nichols. “While we worked with them to find other business locations in College Station, they have chosen to move on to the next phase of developing their drone delivery service, and we wish them well.”

Since then, Prime Air has launched in Waco, San Antonio, and Pontiac and is preparing for operations near Kansas City, Kansas. Per an amendment to its operational specifications published in August, the company is also targeting Houston, Austin, and El Paso in Texas.

Prime Air is one of a handful of drone operators with Part 135 permissions from the FAA. Its MK30 drone carries up to 5 pounds, cruising at about 73 mph. The tailsitter lifts off using six vertical propellers before transitioning to wing-borne forward light. Packages are stored within its fuselage and dropped from a height of about 13 feet.

Per Amazon, the MK30 is smaller, lighter, and more durable than the MK27-2, with a 7.5-mile service radius and the ability to fly in light rain.

Bumpy Drone Expansion

Prime Air said in October 2023 that it was already working with regulators in the UK and Italy to establish a commercial service by late 2024. It had planned for those markets to be the first to integrate drone delivery with its network of fulfillment centers. Instead, that integration happened in Tolleson, Arizona, in November 2024.

“The future has arrived in Italy,” said Pierluigi Di Palma, president of ENAC, in 2023. “Being chosen by a global player such as Amazon is further confirmation of the strategy pursued by ENAC to push for innovation of advanced air mobility in the aviation industry, creating a national ecosystem favorable to the safe development of new services.”

Prime Air’s international expansion has not been as smooth as Amazon and Di Palma may have anticipated.

In December 2024, the company acknowledged it was about one year behind schedule. It said it successfully completed initial trials with its MK30 drone in Italy, where it “continues to work with Italian authorities to meet all the requirements needed to launch the service next year,” in 2025.

Earlier in 2024, Amazon was one of six operators selected by the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to participate in a series of beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) drone delivery trials. In January, it picked a fulfillment center in Darlington, U.K., as the initial site for those trials. However, The Telegraph reported in November that the CAA had not yet authorized them.

The planned operations have reportedly sparked a dispute between Amazon and a local flying club, which per The Telegraph told the CAA it will “inconvenience Amazon within the boundaries of U.K. law” if the testing impedes model aircraft pilots. Prime Air responded by creating a no-fly zone around the club.

Due to a lack of evidence on the drones’ noise impacts, a local council gave Amazon only temporary permission to build drone facilities. The Telegraph reported that Prime Air subsequently reduced its planned operations from 21 to 10 per hour and will build one launch pad rather than two.

Amazon estimates the MK30 to be about 40 percent quieter than the MK27-2, which could assuage noise concerns. But the company has also faced pushback from the UK Ministry of Defense, which per The Telegraph called the drones a “significant risk to flight safety” and lamented potential airspace restrictions on military aircraft.

In October, two Prime Air drones struck the same crane boom in Arizona. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) has cited the crashes—which occurred minutes apart—as evidence that Amazon’s detect and avoid (DAA) systems are not yet mature enough for expanded operations.

In November, another Prime Air drone clipped an internet cable in Waco as it was lifting off from a customer’s backyard. Amazon said it covered repair costs for the internet service provider and reported no damage or injuries. The National Transportation Safety Board told FLYING it will not investigate the event.",https://flyingmag1.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/download-5-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 21:11:39.374684
