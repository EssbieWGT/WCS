This is not the only major industrial project proposed for Guysborough County.
Nova Sustainable Fuels is hosting a community event this week to court community buy-in.","A proposed jet fuel megaproject on Nova Scotia's Eastern Shore is inching forward, with the proponents saying they plan to submit for environmental assessment before the fall.

The proposal is to produce sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, a lower-emission alternative to conventional jet fuel, and ship it by boat to distributors and airlines.

The project would include two components in Guysborough County — a joint wind and solar farm in St. Mary's and a plant in the community of Goldboro. The plant would use the wind and solar energy, as well as wood chips, to power hydrogen production. The hydrogen, in turn, would power the production of SAF.

Michael Galvin has been working on the idea for four years and said he's eager to make the project's first submission to the province. He expects the application for environmental assessment for the Goldboro plant will be made in early September.

""It's really significant and it's also really significant for our investors to see that we have reached this milestone,"" he said in an interview.

The project began with Irish firm Simply Blue Group, but changed hands this year. Galvin was chief operating officer at Simply Blue and moved, along with the project, to Octopus Energy Generation, which is now backing the project.

A local entity, Nova Sustainable Fuels, was created to manage the project.

Interest in sustainable aviation fuel has been growing in recent years, particularly in Europe where some governments have set mandates and created subsidies for its use. Galvin said that means the list of proposed SAF projects — and competitors — got very long. But he said that's begun to change.

""A lot of the hype has started to die down. And now you're seeing the really serious players and really serious investors have now stepped forward, and I think you're seeing the strongest projects and the most likely projects to run to completion.""

Galvin said completion for his project is still at least five years away, assuming it receives all the necessary approvals and raises enough capital. He wouldn't put an exact number on it, but said the cost will be in the billions of dollars.

""It's costing more than I wish it was going to cost. These are big numbers and big infrastructure projects,"" he said.

This is not the only major industrial project proposed for Guysborough County. Other companies are eyeing the remote eastern corner of mainland Nova Scotia for wind farms to power hydrogen production, a commercial spaceport and a gold mine.

Paul Long, warden of the District of the Municipality of Guysborough, said the local government is hungry for economic development.

""We're a small, small municipality — there's only 4,500 people or so in the municipality,"" Long said in an interview.

""So we can't rely just on the tax base, the residential tax base, to do the things we want to do and provide the services for our residents.""

Some past proposals for big industrial projects in the area have flopped, such as the LNG export facility that was abandoned two years ago. The company behind it sold its land and building permits to Simply Blue.

Long said past failures have left some residents ""leery,"" but he thinks generally people are open to new proposals. Nova Sustainable Fuels is hosting a community event this week to court community buy-in. Long said they already have council's support.

He believes there's a unique window open now for new projects to get underway. He pointed to Premier Tim Houston's push for more resource development, and Prime Minister Mark Carney's focus on major projects.

""Everything seems to be falling in line,"" said Long.

It will be years before Galvin is ready to say whether everything has, in fact, fallen in line. He said he expects a final investment decision in 2027. He said groundbreaking would happen no sooner than 2028, which could lead to an operational plant in late 2030 or 2031.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.5953367.1680218808!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/goldboro-lng-site.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-07-23 16:57:03.817819

Tough by Nature

Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is a perennial warm-season grass native to North America. It thrives on marginal land, tolerates drought and heat, and requires minimal fertilizer or irrigation — making it a strong candidate for sustainable biomass production.

High Energy Return

It produces six times more energy than is required to grow and harvest it. That energy ratio, combined with its ability to grow in regions unsuitable for food crops, gives it an edge in the bioenergy landscape.

Not Just Ethanol

Switchgrass isn’t just a source of traditional ethanol. It’s being considered for advanced biofuels like isobutanol and even sustainable aviation fuel via alcohol-to-jet pathways.

Drought Dilemma

When grown in drought conditions, switchgrass produces higher levels of compounds like saponins, which inhibit fermentation. That’s why researchers like Trey Sato are digging into how stress conditions affect downstream conversion.

Feedstock of the Future?

As climate change intensifies and the aviation sector looks to decarbonize, switchgrass may become a key player in next-generation fuel production — but only if its biological bottlenecks can be understood and addressed.",https://seedworld.com/cdn/wp-content/uploads/20250723145246/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-23-2025-02_50_56-PM.png,N,,2025-07-23 16:57:12.485428

President Trump is proving that when the United States leads from strength, the world follows—and America wins.","A HISTORIC TRADE AND INVESTMENT AGREEMENT WITH JAPAN: Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump announced a landmark economic agreement with Japan—one of America’s closest allies and most important trading partners.

This historic deal reflects the strength of the U.S.–Japan relationship and Japan’s recognition of the United States as the most attractive and secure destination for strategic investment in the world.

The agreement reaffirms the shared commitment of both nations to economic prosperity, industrial leadership, and long-term security. It delivers a powerful signal that the U.S.–Japan alliance is not only a cornerstone of peace in the Indo-Pacific, but also a driver of global growth and innovation.

With over $550 billion in a new Japanese/USA investment vehicle and enhanced access for American exports, this agreement marks a new chapter in bilateral cooperation—one that will unleash the full potential of the U.S. economy, strengthen vital supply chains, and support American workers, communities, and businesses for decades to come.

RESTORING AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL POWER: Japan will invest $550 billion directed by the United States to rebuild and expand core American industries.

This is the single largest foreign investment commitment ever secured by any country and will generate hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for generations.

At President Trump’s direction, these funds will be targeted toward the revitalization of America’s strategic industrial base, including:

Energy infrastructure and production, including LNG, advanced fuels, and grid modernization;

Semiconductor manufacturing and research, rebuilding U.S. capacity from design to fabrication;

Critical minerals mining, processing, and refining, ensuring access to essential inputs;

Pharmaceutical and medical production, ending U.S. dependence on foreign-made medicines and supplies;

Commercial and defense shipbuilding, including new yards and modernization of existing facilities.

The United States will retain 90% of the profits from this investment—ensuring that American workers, taxpayers, and communities reap the overwhelming share of the benefit.

This capital surge, combined with the trillions already secured under President Trump’s leadership, will be a key component of a once-in-a-century industrial revival.

ENSURING BALANCED TRADE THROUGH A PREDICTABLE TARIFF FRAMEWORK: As part of this agreement, imports from Japan will be subject to a baseline 15% tariff rate.

In addition to raising billions in revenue, this new tariff framework, combined with expanded U.S. exports and investment-driven production, will help narrow the trade deficit with Japan and restore greater balance to the overall U.S. trade position.

This approach reflects the United States’ broader effort to establish a consistent, transparent, and enforceable trade environment—one in which American workers and producers are no longer disadvantaged by outdated or one-sided trade rules.

By aligning with this framework, Japan affirms the strength and mutual respect of the U.S.–Japan economic relationship and recognizes the importance of durable trade grounded in fairness.

SECURING INCREASED MARKET ACCESS FOR AMERICAN PRODUCERS: For decades, U.S. companies have faced barriers when seeking access to Japan’s market. This agreement delivers breakthrough openings across key sectors:

Agriculture and Food:

Japan will immediately increase imports of U.S. rice by 75%, with a major expansion of import quotas;

Japan will purchase $8 billion in U.S. goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.

Energy:

Major expansion of U.S. energy exports to Japan;

The US and Japan are exploring a new offtake agreement for Alaskan liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Manufacturing and Aerospace:

Japan has committed to purchase U.S.-made commercial aircraft, including an agreement to buy 100 Boeing aircraft;

Additional billions of dollars annually of purchases of U.S. defense equipment, enhancing interoperability and alliance security in the Indo-Pacific.

Automobiles and Industrial Goods:

Longstanding restrictions on U.S. cars and trucks will be lifted, granting U.S. automakers access to the Japanese consumer market; U.S. Automotive standards will be approved in Japan for the first time ever.

Broader openings for a range of industrial and consumer goods, leveling the playing field for American producers.

A GENERATIONAL SHIFT IN U.S.-JAPAN ECONOMIC RELATIONS: This agreement is not merely a trade deal—it is a strategic realignment of the U.S.-Japan economic relationship delivering for the American people.

For the first time, the terms of engagement place American industry, innovation, and labor at the center.

By securing historic investment and breaking open long-closed markets, President Trump has once again delivered a deal that no one else could deliver—a deal that will help to rebuild the American economy, strengthen our industrial foundation, and safeguard our national strength for decades to come.

President Trump is proving that when the United States leads from strength, the world follows—and America wins.

“The £6m government funding boost announced today is a real vote of confidence in our area and it will help to fast-track the project to a final investment decision. So, it isn’t 100% nailed down just yet, but we’re very close and I’ll keep working hard to make it happen in the weeks ahead.”

At Essar Energy Transition’s Stanlow hub, where a variety of projects are being progressed within the orbit of the oil refinery, £2.5m is pledged to take forward plans for a production facility converting methanol into SAF.

This methanol-to-jet hub could, said Essar, be capable of producing 200,000 tonnes per year of advanced SAF, using 550,000 tonnes per year of renewable e-methanol and bio-methanol sourced domestically in the UK and internationally, including from sister company Essar Future Energies, which is developing an e-methanol project in Gujarat.

A feasibility study has been completed this year, and the receipt of this grant from the AFF programme will enable Essar to advance to the pre-front-end engineering design stage.

Essar is targeting completion of this stage by March next year, with full front-end design taking place next summer ahead of a final investment decision by the end of 2027.

The MtJ production hub’s location at Stanlow, close to Ellesmere Port, will look to leverage the terminal’s existing import infrastructure, enabling access to the most competitive, low cost and low carbon intensity methanol feedstocks.

The existing refinery processing facilities, combined with low-carbon power, hydrogen and carbon capture facilities under development, also offer unique integration opportunities to create one of the lowest CI SAF production facilities in the UK, Essar said.

In January this year, Essar appointed Turkish contractor ENKA to deliver a low-carbon hydrogen production plant at Stanlow, a key part of the HyNet project. A £360m carbon capture plant is also in the works.

Essar Energy Transition’s established UK jet export infrastructure includes the Manchester Jet, Midlands, and UKOP oil pipeline systems, as well as existing road and marine distribution routes, allowing supply to regions across the UK. This infrastructure already supplies 10 UK airports including nearby Manchester International Airport.

The hub will be the most direct SAF supply point to the UK aviation sector, the firm said.

Tony Fountain, managing director at Essar Energy Transition, said: “We welcome the UK government’s support, which enables us to carry out a detailed pre-front-end engineering design process and accelerate this flagship UK advanced sustainable aviation fuels project towards final investment decision.

“At Stanlow, we have major decarbonisation ambitions, aiming to become a leading energy transition hub and home to the world’s first low-carbon process refinery. Domestic advanced SAF production is central to our long-term vision and a key catalyst for decarbonising aviation. With SAF still making up only a tiny fraction of global jet fuel use, our MtJ plant will play a critical role in closing that gap and helping the UK meet its Jet Zero targets.”",https://www.placenorthwest.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/essar-stanlow-overview-c-eet.jpg,N,,2025-07-23 11:57:22.606985

In a move that could punch well above its weight, French Polynesia is embracing zero-emission technology in aviation, thanks to a new collaboration between ATOBA Energy and local airline Air Moana.

Pioneering SAF in One of the World’s Most Remote Places

On July 22, 2025, ATOBA and Air Moana inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), laying the groundwork for a 10-year SAF partnership. This isn’t just a symbolic handshake; it’s a serious, long-term bet on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) transforming inter-island travel in Tahiti and the surrounding archipelago. The plan includes a mix of good old-fashioned physical fuel deliveries and a more modern twist: a “book and claim” system that helps bridge infrastructure gaps.

Out here, where hopping on a plane is more necessity than luxury, this is a big deal. With over 100 islands sprinkled across the sea, aviation is often the only way people, goods, and services move around. But all those flights come at an environmental cost—especially when the fuel powering them travels thousands of kilometers. That’s where SAF comes into play.

What’s SAF, and How Does ‘Book and Claim’ Help?

Sustainable aviation fuel is made from renewable sources—think waste oils, agricultural byproducts, and other biomass. Depending on how it’s produced, SAF can cut lifecycle emissions by as much as 80%. Even better, it works in existing aircraft with no modifications needed. Air Moana’s choice of ATR 72-600 aircraft, which are already pretty efficient, means every drop of SAF counts even more.

Now, let’s talk about that ‘book and claim’ model. It’s kind of like green energy certificates for aviation. The airline buys SAF credits, confirming the fuel was produced and injected into the system—even if it wasn’t pumped into their own planes. It’s a smart way to kickstart cleaner skies while the actual delivery infrastructure catches up in remote places like this.

This Is What a Long Game Looks Like

This isn’t a quick PR play or a one-off trial flight. With a bold 10-year offtake agreement, Air Moana becomes the first airline in the South Pacific to lock in SAF for the long haul. That kind of commitment sends a clear message to fuel producers and investors: there’s real momentum building here. And with early conversations already happening around setting up local production in Tahiti, this deal could pave the way for new infrastructure—and new jobs—down the line.

For ATOBA, the partnership also reflects a shift in strategy. They’re leaning into delivering SAF where it’s needed most but hardest to implement. With expertise spanning technology evaluation, market analysis, and negotiating the long-term deals that make everything tick, the France-based energy firm is helping level the playing field for small, remote airlines trying to do the right thing.

Beyond Emissions: Building Local Resilience

This isn’t just about reducing emissions—it’s also about rewriting the economic script. A healthy SAF market in the Pacific could eventually support homegrown refining, creating local jobs, encouraging skills development, and diversifying economies that rely heavily on tourism and fisheries. And in a place that’s already feeling the impacts of rising seas and changing weather patterns, that kind of green resilience isn’t just nice to have—it’s vital.

Of course, no road is without bumps. SAF still costs more than traditional fuel. And some folks aren’t sold on the certificate system, arguing that emissions cuts should happen where they’re claimed. Valid points. This makes transparency, smart governance, and a steady move toward actual fuel deliveries all the more important to keep the trust and momentum going.

Zooming Out: A Global Movement with Local Flavor

Big headlines about green hydrogen and SAF adoption often come from places like Europe or California—where policy tools, funding, and infrastructure make things easier. But many remote regions lag not because of a lack of vision, but simply because they don’t have the same resources. That’s why this partnership stands out. It’s a homegrown solution, with both eyes on the long term, in one of the most challenging—and crucial—settings for sustainable energy transitions.

A new Deloitte analysis of the European Union’s ReFuelEU Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandate suggests that the climate-centric rule could unintentionally deter travelers from using European carriers and hubs, potentially adding cost and complexity to trips that originate, connect, or terminate in Brussels and other EU cities.

What the ReFuelEU mandate asks of airlines

Under ReFuelEU, airlines operating from European airports must steadily increase the proportion of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blended into every gallon of jet fuel they load. The regulation is a cornerstone of the bloc’s plan to decarbonize aviation, yet still accommodate the millions of people who rely on air travel for work and leisure. Unlike carbon offset programs, the SAF rule directly targets aircraft emissions by substituting a portion of fossil-based kerosene with bio- or synthetic alternatives.

Deloitte’s study, prepared for industry trade group Airlines for Europe, contends the mandate could prove more disruptive than policymakers anticipate. The research team modeled ticket prices on long-haul flights, comparing European carriers bound by the SAF quota to competitors operating from hubs in Istanbul, Dubai, and Doha. Those non-EU airlines face no comparable requirement and can therefore buy traditional jet fuel at today’s lower market price.

A potential 15 percent difference by 2030

The price gap is not trivial. “Cost disparities could rise by up to 15 percent on key EU–Asia routes by 2030,” Deloitte wrote in the study. In a statement, the company said. For a family of four planning a European summer vacation in Southeast Asia, the differential might translate into hundreds of euros, enough to make a one-stop itinerary via Istanbul or Dubai look far more attractive than a direct flight on a European flag carrier.

Why travelers could feel the pinch

Airlines typically pass additional operating costs on to passengers. If meeting the SAF requirement adds several euros to every long-haul ticket, price-sensitive travelers may book through non-EU hubs or even shift their vacation entirely outside the bloc, the report warns. Such “carbon and business leakage” undermines the EU’s climate goals because the flight happens anyway—just with tanks full of cheaper, more polluting fuel loaded elsewhere.

Besides higher fares, European passengers might confront reduced nonstop options. As ticket sales migrate to non-EU carriers, European airlines could trim or cancel marginal routes, forcing travelers onto less convenient schedules or multiple connections.

SAF-BAM: An accounting fix on the table

To preserve environmental ambition while leveling the commercial playing field, Deloitte proposes a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Book and Claim Accounting Mechanism, or SAF-BAM. The concept is similar to renewable energy certificates in the power sector.

Airlines purchase SAF where it is most readily available—perhaps at a U.S. refinery or a Nordic biofuel complex—and earn digital certificates that represent the environmental benefits.

Those certificates can be claimed against any flight, even if the physical fuel uplift takes place elsewhere.

Revenue from buying certificates would be channeled into additional green aviation projects across Europe.

Because the mechanism decouples where SAF is burned from who pays, it reduces the incentive to exploit non-EU hubs solely to escape higher fuel costs. Deloitte argues the approach also avoids the legal hurdles of extending the EU’s existing Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)—currently applied to steel, cement, and other goods—to the aviation sector.

What this means for your next trip

For now, the numbers in the Deloitte model are projections, not hard-wired increases. Airlines typically hedge fuel purchases months in advance, and some have long-term SAF supply agreements that could buffer initial price shocks. Still, frequent flyers and vacation planners should watch how major European carriers respond in the run-up to 2030.

Tips for Travelers

Compare hubs: When shopping for long-haul tickets, check fares via EU airports such as Brussels, Frankfurt, or Paris against similar routings through Istanbul or Dubai. A small detour could save money, although it may add to the travel time.

Monitor fuel surcharges: Airlines often break out a “carrier-imposed surcharge” on your fare. Rising SAF costs may appear first here.

Leverage loyalty programs: If European airlines raise cash prices, redeeming frequent-flyer miles may offer better value than spending euros.

Watch for SAF opt-in programs: Some carriers already let passengers pay a bit extra to guarantee a portion of SAF on their flight. Participation could become mandatory later; locking in voluntary rates now may be more cost-effective.

Consider the carbon math: Even if a non-EU routing is cheaper, remember that extra connecting flights generally increase total emissions and travel time.

The bottom line for flyers

Europe is serious about decarbonizing aviation, but good intentions can collide with market realities. Unless policymakers fine-tune ReFuelEU—or adopt a SAF-BAM system—travelers may find themselves weighing higher prices for direct flights against longer, cheaper itineraries outside the bloc. Either way, understanding the forces reshaping the fare you pay will help you book smarter, greener trips in the years ahead.",https://jetsetterguide.com/sites/default/files/2024-02/AdobeStock_311641578.jpeg,N,,2025-07-23 12:56:20.088337

The paper details how Syzygy's NovaSAF™ platform offers a scalable, policy-aligned, and economically viable pathway to decarbonize aviation.

""NovaSAF™ is more than a product—it's a policy enabler,"" said Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics. ""This white paper shows how technology innovation can help regulators and industry meet climate goals while unlocking new economic opportunities.""

As global regulators accelerate efforts to reduce aviation emissions, SAF demand is expected to exceed 200 million metric tons annually by 2050. However, current supply falls short by more than 120 million metric tons. NovaSAF™ addresses this gap by converting biogenic methane and carbon dioxide into ASTM-certified SAF using light-activated catalysts and renewable electricity. This process reduces equipment costs, leverages widely available feedstocks, and delivers strong project returns. Altogether, this pathway is generally at or lower cost than HEFA and can even achieve Jet-A parity in the right scenarios.

Crucially, NovaSAF™ meets both SAF and eSAF (electrofuels) requirements under the EU's RED III directive and the UK's Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO). A NovaSAF plant will create SAF with two separate qualifications, a portion of the volume produced will qualify as an Advanced Biofuel, and the remaining portion will qualify as a Renewable Fuel of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO). This dual compliance enables access to premium SAF markets and supports long-term investment viability.

The paper highlights how NovaSAF is enabled by Syzygy's Rigel reactor technology, which is powered by renewable electricity and eliminates the need to combust fossil fuels. This critical piece is then combined with the well-established Fischer-Tropsch technology to turn the biogas into a liquid that can then be hydrotreated to create SAF. A final critical element are Syzygy's innovations around these technologies together into a modular system, which enables distributed, site-adaptable production.

It also features Syzygy's first commercial project, NovaSAF 1, located in Uruguay. This facility will convert manure from 14,000 cows into 400,000 gallons (1,100 tons) of SAF annually, powered by a national grid that is over 90 percent renewable. The project demonstrates the platform's scalability and its potential to reduce both methane and aviation-related emissions.

Syzygy's strategy focuses on scaling SAF production through repeatable project execution and technology licensing, aiming to meet the growing demand for low-carbon aviation fuels over the next 25 years.

A GPIF spokesperson told Responsible Investor that allocation size will depend on the RFP results.

The Luxembourg Finance Labelling Agency (LuxFLAG) has clarified to RI that changes to its ESG label’s eligibility criteria do not mean that European funds will no longer need to comply with the EU’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) to qualify for the label. In its updated guidance, LuxFLAG had stated that being classified as Article 8 or 9 under the regime is “no longer a prerequisite” for being eligible to the ESG label. “This adjustment supports LuxFLAG’s global outreach,” the agency said. However, LuxFLAG has clarified that this only refers to funds outside the scope of SFDR. “So far, our footprint is mostly European with few non-eligible requests because of the product jurisdiction,” a spokesperson said. “This criteria update will unlock these possibilities and will make eligible non-EU products from existing product manufacturers based outside the EU.”

Regarding the upcoming SFDR review, the spokesperson said LuxFLAG remains aligned with the framework “but believe a more inclusive and international approach is necessary to address the growing interest in credible, third-party sustainability labels”. They added that LuxFLAG is “highly likely” to adapt accordingly, should SFDR be reviewed.

Several changes have been made to LuxFLAG’s criteria “in line with evolving market practices and stakeholder expectations”. These include requiring asset managers of labelled products to be signatories of a “recognised” responsible investment framework and for ESG due diligence to be systematically integrated into the investment process for 100 percent of portfolio holdings, as well as refinements to the terminology for exclusions and engagement. The updates aim to ensure continued robustness, international alignment and improved accessibility for a broader range of financial products, LuxFLAG said.

The Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI) has urged the Japanese government to address its dependence on fossil fuel imports by accelerating its national transition strategy – called the Green Transformation (GX) strategy. A briefing from CBI warned that the reliance on hydrocarbons, particularly on natural gas, “has become a critical vulnerability amid escalating geopolitical instability” and is inconsistent with Japan’s 2050 net-zero target. The NGO also noted that the construction of new gas plants with the assumption that carbon capture, ammonia and hydrogen could be used to replace gas in the future is predicated on “transition pathways [that] are currently unproven and uncertain”.

European residential real estate companies are facing manageable transition risks up to 2030, although tighter environmental policies could increase debt “materially”, according to new analysis by S&P Global Ratings. The ratings agency said the passthrough of utility costs and diversification of asset portfolios have helped shield companies in the sample against the credit impact of climate transition risks over the past few years, but that more stringent regulation could result in a one-notch lower rating for 10 of the 15 firms assessed.

Europe’s success in decarbonising its energy sector is being offset by rising emissions from aviation, according to new analysis by Barclays. A note published by the bank found that aviation emits more CO2 than the power sectors of both France and Portugal, as the aviation industry refocuses its decarbonisation pathway from electric and hydrogen powered aircraft towards sustainable aviation fuel and offsets. “The fresh political and environmental situation that has arisen from the new US administration has seen European airlines question the lack of a level playing field between European airlines and global competitors,” the analysts said, noting industry scepticism over the energy sector’s ability to support the production of sufficient sustainable aviation fuel.",https://media.responsible-investor.com/uploads/2024/07/admin-ajax.jpeg,N,,2025-07-23 11:57:42.939308

Syzygy Plasmonics has recently released a transformative white paper titled ""Solving the SAF Trilemma: Cost, Feedstock, and Financeability."" This essential document articulates a fresh perspective on producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and highlights the company's innovative NovaSAF™ platform. Their methodology integrates scalable solutions that align with current policies and economic realities, making it a viable path to reducing carbon emissions in aviation.

NovaSAF™: A Game-Changer in Aviation Fuel Production

Trevor Best, the CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics, stated, ""NovaSAF™ is more than a product—it's a policy enabler."" This sentiment underscores the potential of this new white paper showing how technological advancements can align regulatory frameworks with industry needs, further supporting climate action and creating economic possibilities.

The Demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

With global regulators intensifying commitments to cut aviation emissions, the demand for SAF is projected to soar. By 2050, forecasts suggest a need exceeding 200 million metric tons of SAF annually. However, the currently available supply falls significantly short, with a gap of over 120 million metric tons. The NovaSAF™ initiative aims to address this critical shortfall. It converts biogenic methane and carbon dioxide into ASTM-certified SAF, utilizing innovative light-activated catalysts and renewable electricity. Such a method not only diminishes overall equipment costs but also takes advantage of widely accessible feedstocks and yields strong returns on projects.

A Cost-Effective Approach to SAF Production

One of the standout features of the NovaSAF™ process is its ability to deliver SAF at costs comparable to or below traditional hydrogenated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) technologies. This opens doors for potential scenarios where it can achieve cost parity with conventional jet fuels, such as Jet-A.

Regulatory Compliance and Market Access

NovaSAF™ successfully meets both SAF and eSAF (electrofuels) requirements as outlined by the European Union's RED III directive and the UK's Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO). The production from a NovaSAF plant will yield SAF with two separate classifications: an Advanced Biofuel and a Renewable Fuel of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO). This dual compliance grants access to premium SAF markets and strengthens the long-term viability of investments in sustainable fuel technology.

Powering NovaSAF™ with Renewable Energy

Central to the NovaSAF™ technology is Syzygy's Rigel reactor, which leverages renewable energy to eliminate fossil fuel combustion in the production process. This advancement pairs seamlessly with established Fischer-Tropsch technology, which transforms biogas into liquid fuels suitable for further processing into SAF. Notably, the integration of these technologies into a modular system enhances the adaptability of production sites, making them capable of delivering localized solutions.

First Commercial Project and Future Prospects

Highlighting the practical applications of NovaSAF™, the paper discusses Syzygy's inaugural commercial project, NovaSAF 1. This innovative facility, situated in a region with over 90 percent renewable energy, will transform manure produced by 14,000 cows into 400,000 gallons (1,100 tons) of SAF annually. This project not only demonstrates the scalability of the NovaSAF™ platform but also promises to mitigate both methane emissions and those associated with aviation.

Syzygy's strategic commitment centers on increasing the production of SAF through consistent project execution and technology licensing. The company aims to meet the burgeoning demand for low-carbon aviation fuels over the forthcoming 25 years, ensuring that its sustainable solutions are both economically and environmentally sound.

The updates aimed to reduce the carbon intensity of the state’s transportation fuel by 30% by 2030 and by 90% by 2045, the 8 July report said.
“Implementing the 1 July effective date for the LCFS provides critical certainty to industry, as well as the LCFS credit market,” said CARB Board Chair Liane Randolph.
CARB said the amendments would reduce GHG emissions by 558M tonnes between 2025 and 2045.

The updates aimed to reduce the carbon intensity of the state’s transportation fuel by 30% by 2030 and by 90% by 2045, the 8 July report said.

Other changes to the LCFS programme included a requirement for fuel producers to track crop-based and forestry-based feedstocks to their point of origin; independent feedstock certification to ensure biomass-based diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstocks are not undermining natural carbon stocks; a halt to palm-derived fuels receiving credits; and a cap on the use of soyabean oil, canola oil and sunflower oil in the production of LCFS-compliant biodiesel diesel fuels, Biodiesel magazine wrote.

The amended regulation focuses public and private sector investment towards increasing cleaner fuel and transportation options for Californians, accelerating the deployment of zero-emission infrastructure and helping the state achieve legally mandated air quality and climate targets, CARB said on 27 June.

“Implementing the 1 July effective date for the LCFS provides critical certainty to industry, as well as the LCFS credit market,” said CARB Board Chair Liane Randolph.

“But often lost in the noise around this programme are our primary reasons for approving it: better health for Californians, our economy and the environment, as well as achieving required state and federal air quality standards.”

The LCFS reduces air pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by setting a declining target for the carbon in transportation fuels used in California; producers that do not meet established benchmarks buy credits from others that do.

CARB said the amendments would reduce GHG emissions by 558M tonnes between 2025 and 2045.

Since its introduction, the LCFS had reduced the carbon in California’s fuel mix by almost 13% and replaced 75% of the diesel used in the state with cleaner alternatives, displacing 320M tonnes of CO2 since 2011, the board added.

California consumes most of the renewable diesel produced in the USA, with the fuel making up nearly 65% of its transportation distillate consumption in the third quarter of 2024, according to US Energy Information Administration (EIA) data.

In addition, quite a few projects include biomass to electricity.

""Firewood, pellets and wood chips - these are domestic renewable energy sources that America needs for heating our homes, institutions and businesses,"" said John Ackerly, President of the Alliance for Green Heat. ""They help take strain off of our electric grids, they are affordable for rural communities and sustainable.""

The Alliance for Green Heat was not eligible for funding for firewood bank assistance through this grant process but has been advocating for an extension of the funding established through a Congressional earmark.

The program was founded in 2015, under President Obama, in part to mitigate the impacts of climate change, as wildfires began to increase. It also sought to assist using low grade wood as an energy source. Overall, it has supported the forestry industry in many ways, but from its founding in 2015 until 2021, the budget was relatively small, around $8 million. As of 2022, as wildfire risks became even greater, and with funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, funding began to climb rapidly and reached $74 million last year.

The $80 million announced July 17 includes grants under three programs:

The Wood Innovations Grant Program supports projects that expand the use of wood products, including firewood and pellets

The Community Wood Grant Program helps fund ready-to-go, local projects that use wood for heat and energy.

The Wood Products Infrastructure Assistance Program funds facilities that purchase and process byproducts from forest restoration projects from federal or tribal lands.

The sport’s global fanbase has grown to more than 826 million and race attendance has reached more than six million.
How can you look at the solutions that work in Formula 1, at mass events with hundreds of thousands of people, globally?
Alongside this, Ellen feels that F1 is uniquely set up to support the development and amplification of new technologies.","Formula 1’s Sustainability Update 2025 says that the organisation is on track to reach its goal of net zero by 2030.

It has achieved a 26% reduction in carbon emissions at the end of 2024 compared to its 2018 baseline.

Over the same period, race attendance has grown from four million to 6.5 million and F1’s global fanbase is now more than 826 million.

If no changes had been made to operations, F1 estimates that there would have been a 10% increase in its carbon footprint.

Stefano Domenicali, President and CEO of Formula 1, said in the report: “We are strongly committed to achieving net zero by 2030. It is a concrete goal, already visible in the significant reduction of our sport’s carbon footprint.

“Formula 1 has always been synonymous with innovation and the desire to improve.

“Once again, this mentality has allowed us to make important progress, not only for those who work in this world, but also for society as a whole.”

Driving sustainability at Formula 1

Ellen Jones, Head of ESG at Formula 1, leads the business’ sustainability strategy.

She joined the business in 2022 with previous experience from Pret A Manger and Accenture.

Ellen earned a BA in Architecture from Yale University and an MS in Sustainable Environmental Design from the Architectural Association School of Architecture.

“Not only do I get to work in the wonderful four walls of Formula 1 management, looking at broadcast and logistics, but I also get to work across our sport with F1 teams, our race promoters who are event hosts and our broadcasters,” Ellen tells Sustainability Magazine.

“What we have tried to do as a sport is ask how we can take climate action now and explore how we can do so much more together, whether that's through partnerships or through shared solutions.

“It's a real balance of individual activity within the organisations that make up our sport, as well as shared activity across the stakeholders who all love the races.”

Behind F1’s 2030 net zero goal

By 2030, F1 aims to reach net zero against a 2018 baseline with a minimum 50% emissions reduction target.

“Being Formula 1, we want to beat that number,” Ellen says.

“When we do exhaust the reductions phase, we will look at what are credible offsets at that time.”

She explains: “In our sustainability strategy, you have things that are different from a normal bricks and mortar because it's about the relationships that we have across the sport.

“We also look to make a unique contribution as Formula 1 by developing road relevant solutions. You see that in our cars with hybrid engines and you'll see that in our cars in 2026 with advanced sustainable fuel.

“How those two cross pollinate is what I find fascinating. How we innovate on track and how that culture, mindset and knowledge of the technical innovation space helps us innovate off track.”

Influencing global sustainability

Formula 1’s unique position in sustainability also extends to its influence and fans.

The sport’s global fanbase has grown to more than 826 million and race attendance has reached more than six million.

“From our side, we have two different conversations when you talk about the platform,” Ellen explains.

“One is a B2C conversation with our fans about being part of something bigger and supporting change by being at a Formula 1 race. You're part of this progression that's able to happen.

“The second is a B2B conversation. How do we talk to businesses about what solutions you can integrate today? How can you look at the solutions that work in Formula 1, at mass events with hundreds of thousands of people, globally?

“If we can do that across those contexts and give case studies of what works, then hopefully it can inspire other businesses to say ‘if this works for Formula 1, it can work for us’.”

Challenges and opportunities for sustainability in F1

Reducing emissions by 26% brings F1 more than halfway to its goal of reducing emissions 50%, but more needs to be done yet.

Ellen explains that F1, like many businesses, faces challenges in changing mindsets on sustainability.

“Sustainability and performance are better delivered together and we have those examples within F1 every day showing that when you build sustainability from the front into your strategy, you're not making compromises on what is delivered,” she says.

Despite an increase in both number of events and attendance, F1 has achieved a 12% reduction in its average per-event energy emissions showing that growth and emissions can be decoupled.

Alongside this, Ellen feels that F1 is uniquely set up to support the development and amplification of new technologies.

Integration with other Essar Energy Transition businesses—EET Fuels, EET Hydrogen, and EET Hydrogen Power—will further support Stanlow’s evolution into a leading energy transition complex.
The mandate sets phased targets, requiring 22% of aviation fuel to come from SAF by 2040—up from just 2% today.","Essar Energy Transition (EET), a key player in the UK's decarbonisation landscape, has secured £2.5 million in funding from the UK Government’s Department for Transport (DfT) under its Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF). This financial backing is designated to advance EET's vision of creating one of the UK’s largest advanced Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production hubs at Stanlow, Cheshire. The facility is a core element of EET’s strategy to transform Stanlow into the world’s first low-carbon process refinery.

The project will centre around the development of a Methanol-to-Jet (MtJ) SAF production hub, which is expected to produce up to 200,000 tonnes of advanced SAF annually. The plant will rely on approximately 550,000 tonnes of renewable e-methanol and bio-methanol each year, sourced both from within the UK and internationally. A portion of this methanol will be supplied by Essar Future Energies, a sister company currently developing a renewable methanol project in Gujarat, India.

With a feasibility study successfully completed earlier in 2025, the new grant will allow the project to progress to the Pre-Front-End Engineering Design (pre-FEED) stage. This phase is scheduled for completion by March 2026, followed by the start of the full Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) in Q2 2026. Essar anticipates reaching a Final Investment Decision (FID) by the end of 2027.

Stanlow’s strategic location offers several advantages, including the presence of existing import infrastructure at Stanlow Terminals. This enables access to competitively priced, low-carbon-intensity methanol feedstocks. The site also benefits from existing refining capabilities, along with upcoming low-carbon power, hydrogen production, and carbon capture infrastructure, allowing for a fully integrated low-emission SAF facility.

The SAF produced at this hub will be distributed through Essar’s extensive jet fuel logistics network, which includes the Manchester Jet Line, Midlands and UKOP pipelines, as well as road and marine routes. This system currently supplies fuel to 10 UK airports, including Manchester International, positioning the facility as a key direct supplier to the UK aviation industry. SAF will be blended on-site with existing jet fuel supplies to ensure seamless integration into the current distribution network.

Moreover, the Stanlow hub is designed with scalability in mind. As SAF demand increases in the coming decades, the site offers potential for significant expansion. Integration with other Essar Energy Transition businesses—EET Fuels, EET Hydrogen, and EET Hydrogen Power—will further support Stanlow’s evolution into a leading energy transition complex.

EET Managing Director Tony Fountain expressed strong support for the government’s role in enabling this transition, stating that domestic SAF production is crucial for aviation decarbonisation and national Jet Zero goals. The MtJ hub will be instrumental in closing the gap in global SAF supply, which remains a small fraction of total jet fuel use.

The initiative aligns with the UK’s SAF Mandate, which came into effect in January 2025. The mandate sets phased targets, requiring 22% of aviation fuel to come from SAF by 2040—up from just 2% today. This MtJ project will help EET meet its own SAF obligations under the mandate by 2035. The £2.5m grant is part of a broader £63 million AFF allocation for SAF projects between July 2025 and March 2026, with further government incentives and policy support expected to follow.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-23 11:58:43.634858

However, rigid carbon intensity (CI) accounting procedures in current policies may limit CI responsiveness across candidate sites and facilities.

Work published in the journal ACS Sustainable Resource Management examines a hypothetical biomass-to-sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) process to demonstrate how GHG accounting requirements drive estimates of biofuel CI and to explore potential CI and financial implications of scenario-specific life cycle assessment (LCA).

The CI of hypothetical SAF produced from miscanthus via the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) pathway was calculated according to specifications from three low-carbon fuel policies (U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), Canada Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR), and California Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), and the 45Z tax credit.

These were compared against modeling results tailored to specific feedstock-to-fuel scenarios (scenario-specific LCA) defined by feedstock and facility siting and feedstock split ratio (the proportion of miscanthus allocated to fuel production vs. electricity).

GHG accounting using the CFR/LCFS can reasonably account for distinct levels of net electricity production by a biorefinery, but only the CFR yields similar CI sensitivity to spatially explicit factors as scenario-specific LCA. Most GHG accounting frameworks do not capture CI variation across candidate sites in the United States.

Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech, emphasized the significance of this funding: “The future of aviation fuel lies in ethanol-to-SAF solutions, and LanzaTech is leading this transition.","LanzaTech Global, Inc., a leading innovator in carbon management technologies, has been awarded a £6.4 million grant by the UK government through its Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF), which is managed by the Department for Transport (DfT). This funding is designated to support the advancement of LanzaTech’s pivotal DRAGON 1 and DRAGON 2 projects—two initiatives aimed at transforming the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) landscape in the UK. The DRAGON initiative, which stands for Decarbonizing and Reimagining Aviation for the Goal Of Netzero, is central to the UK’s goal of achieving a cleaner and more sustainable aviation sector.

The DRAGON 1 project is LanzaTech’s existing SAF development located in Port Talbot, South Wales. This facility converts recycled carbon fuel ethanol—some of which is produced through LanzaTech’s proprietary gas fermentation technology—into advanced sustainable aviation fuel using the LanzaJet® Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) process. This ethanol-to-SAF pathway is gaining recognition as one of the most effective and scalable solutions for decarbonizing air travel.

DRAGON 2 represents the next step in LanzaTech’s SAF ambitions. It will be a Power-to-Liquid (PtL) facility that synthesizes ethanol from captured carbon dioxide and green hydrogen. This ethanol will then be processed into SAF at a neighboring site using the same LanzaJet® AtJ technology. The specific location for DRAGON 2 is yet to be finalized and will be determined during the course of this grant-funded phase.

What sets these projects apart is the integration of LanzaTech’s carbon recycling platform with LanzaJet’s conversion technology. By utilizing locally sourced waste carbon and renewable hydrogen, the combined approach delivers SAF with a significantly lower Carbon Intensity (CI). This not only supports the UK’s SAF Mandate but also promotes industrial revitalization, job creation, and regional economic growth.

Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech, emphasized the significance of this funding: “The future of aviation fuel lies in ethanol-to-SAF solutions, and LanzaTech is leading this transition. The UK government’s backing reinforces our pioneering role and strengthens our mission to create a circular carbon economy for aviation. DRAGON 1 and 2 demonstrate how bold, innovative projects can drive global progress in SAF.”

The government’s financial support underscores confidence in LanzaTech’s technology and the broader potential for waste-based SAF production. This vote of confidence comes in tandem with recognition for Project Speedbird, another LanzaJet-led initiative in which LanzaTech holds a 36% stake. Project Speedbird received £10 million in AFF funding, further highlighting the UK’s strong alignment with LanzaTech and LanzaJet’s strategies.

In 2024, LanzaTech and LanzaJet jointly launched CirculAir™, a comprehensive SAF platform that converts various forms of waste carbon—including CO2, municipal solid waste, and agricultural residues—into jet fuel.

On Monday 21 July, Aviation Minister Mike Kane MP visited the university to announce the funding. Sheffield will lead a £1.5 million initiative aimed at commercialising its novel SAF technology and encouraging investment in future production facilities to boost the availability of the cleaner fuel.

The scheme, known as NextGen-SAF, brings together a partnership of international and UK-based organisations, including Fuel Cell Energy (USA), Green Lizard Technologies (UK), Drax Power (UK), IMI Vivo (Italy), Gardner Consulting (UK), and Leeds Bradford Airport (UK). The project has also garnered backing from major players such as Airbus, Boeing, Qatar Airways, and the City of Doncaster Council.

While SAF is often made from organic or waste materials, concerns remain over whether those resources can be scaled to meet demand. The University of Sheffield’s new method bypasses these limitations by using renewable energy in tandem with advanced carbon capture systems to create fuel.

This innovative approach, known as Power to Liquid (PtL), involves producing hydrogen through renewable electricity and capturing carbon dioxide from industrial sources or the atmosphere. These are combined to form synthetic hydrocarbons, which are then refined into usable aviation fuel.

Not only could this technique make SAF more cost-effective, but it also allows greater flexibility and the potential to cut emissions across industrial sectors.

NextGen-SAF will create a pioneering demonstration plant that integrates two core technologies: a Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) and an Advanced Fischer-Tropsch (AFT) reactor. Together, these systems will generate hydrogen, capture CO2, and synthesise hydrocarbons, offering a fully integrated route to SAF production. The goal is to prove the system’s efficiency, stability, and scalability.

“We are proud to lead this project, made possible by this vital funding, to develop a new and innovative SAF production pathway. Sustainable Aviation Fuel is essential to reducing emissions from the aviation industry, and through this project we are taking a major step toward scaling up SAF production right here in the UK. This initiative not only advances the UK’s goals around SAF but also strengthens the nation’s fuel production capabilities and will deliver lasting economic benefits.”

Professor Koen Lamberts, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sheffield.

The Sheffield project is one of 17 receiving a share of £63 million in government funding to speed up SAF development.

“This £63 million is lift-off for Britain’s green aviation revolution. We’re not just backing brilliant British innovation; we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market.

From the labs of Sheffield to the runways of the future – this is how we kickstart economic growth, secure energy independence, and make Britain a clean energy superpower.”

Mike Kane, Aviation Minister.

Sheffield has earned a global reputation for its SAF research, hosting some of Europe’s top clean energy facilities at its Energy Innovation Centre. These include pilot-scale systems designed to support industry and academic partnerships in trialling cutting-edge low-carbon technologies.

The University is also home to the UK SAF Clearing House, one of only two such centres worldwide, which helps fuel developers meet the strict certification standards required for aviation use.

Sheffield’s expertise was also instrumental in the world’s first transatlantic flight powered by SAF, during which its researchers measured the impact of the fuel on emissions and contrail formation. Their analysis revealed emission cuts of up to 70 per cent.

“It is fantastic to see the University of Sheffield playing a leading role in the development of sustainable aviation fuel and supporting the aviation industry in its efforts to reduce its emissions. At Sheffield we have some of the most advanced SAF research facilities in Europe and are excited to work with partners from the industry to help them test and develop new fuels and next generation clean energy technologies.”

The grant will accelerate the development of LanzaTech’s DRAGON 1 & 2 projects, each playing a role in the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the UK. Project DRAGON stands for Decarbonizing and Reimagining Aviation for the Goal Of Netzero.

The DRAGON 1 project is LanzaTech’s existing UK SAF project that will convert recycled carbon fuel ethanol (including ethanol from LanzaTech’s gas fermentation process) into Advanced SAF in Port Talbot, South Wales, using the LanzaJet Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) process.

The DRAGON 2 project is a Power-to-Liquid (PtL) facility that will convert waste carbon dioxide and green hydrogen into ethanol for subsequent conversion into PtL SAF at an adjacent facility using the LanzaJet Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) process. The location for DRAGON 2 in the UK will be determined during this grant-funded project.

Integrating LanzaTech’s gas fermentation process with LanzaJet’s AtJ technology gives this approach a distinctive edge, the company says. By turning regional waste resources into valuable SAF, LanzaTech facilitates the production of low Carbon Intensity (CI) fuels, contributing positively to the UK’s SAF Mandate and supporting economic growth and job creation in industrial zones in the UK.

Separately, Project Speedbird by LanzaJet, in which LanzaTech holds a 36% ownership stake, also received recognition and £10 million (US$13.5 million) in funding from the Advanced Fuels Fund. In 2024, LanzaTech and LanzaJet partnered to create CirculAir, that transforms nearly any form of waste carbon (including CO2, MSW, agri residues) into SAF, combining the technologies of both companies to provide the aviation industry with a solution to produce waste-based SAF on a global scale.

Fuels giant Essar Energy Transition (EET) is to develop one of the UK’s largest sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production hubs close to the River Mersey.

EET operates the second-largest oil refinery in the UK at Stanlow in Ellesmere Port. It already supplies conventional jet fuel via either road or pipeline to 10 UK airports including Liverpool and Manchester.

SAF is jet fuel produced from a variety of sources including household waste, used cooking oil as well as forestry and agricultural waste. Because it is a ‘drop-in fuel’ it means it can be blended with conventional jet fuel without any modifications.

Powering aircraft is one of the big conundrums of the push towards cutting CO2 emissions. A commercial airliner requires significant power to take off and travel long distances.

There have been trials using both batteries and hydrogen but so far these have proven challenging. SAF is currently seen as the best way to keep flying but reduce emissions.

It is claimed SAF can reduce emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel although critics say it simply shifts some of those emissions to other parts of the supply chain. SAF is also more expensive.

EET has secured £2.5m from the Government to establish an SAF hub at Stanlow. It plans to use methanol-to-jet technology to convert renewable e-methanol and bio-methanol into SAF. Stanlow is also the nerve centre for the multi-billion pound HyNet hydrogen project.

Leveraging Stanlow Terminals existing import infrastructure enables access to low carbon intensity methanol feedstocks. SAF will be blended on-site with EET Fuels’ existing jet fuel production to directly supply UK airports.

This hub will have the capacity to produce 200,000 tonnes a year if SAF, using 550,000 tonnes of renewable e-methanol and bio-methanol sourced domestically in the UK and from its sister company – Essar Future Energies – in Gujarat, India.

The Department for Transport has offered the funding from its £63m Advanced Fuels Fund. EET can now advance to the pre-front-end engineering design (pre-FEED) stage. It is targeting completion of pre-FEED by March 2026, with full FEED commencing in Q2 2026 and final investment decision by the end of 2027.

The plant will be located in the Liepāja Special Economic Zone (LSEZ), Latvia, through the newly formed joint venture NorSAF, in collaboration with local partners.

The NorSAF facility is expected to begin operations in 2030, delivering up to 100,000 tonnes of SAF annually.

Estimated investment in the project ranges between €500 million and €600 million, with financial backing sought from EU funds, institutional investors, and public sector stakeholders.

The plant will serve both regional airlines and global markets, supporting the growing demand for low-emission aviation solutions.

The EU mandates that SAF must make up at least 2% of jet fuel usage at airports in 2025, increasing to 6% by 2030, 20% by 2035, and reaching 70% by 2050. This regulation reflects the urgent need for cleaner fuel sources in aviation, an industry under increasing pressure to meet stringent emissions targets.

Gediminas Ziemelis, Chairman of Avia Solutions Group, stressed the strategic importance of the project: “The current global supply of sustainable aviation fuel is far from sufficient to meet the regulatory and commercial demand anticipated in the coming years. Our new facility in Liepāja will be vital in securing supply chains for the future of green aviation.”

The plant will utilise PureSAF technology, developed by Swedish Biofuels and licensed exclusively to US engineering company KBR.

This technology has demonstrated greenhouse gas emissions reductions of up to 93% compared to fossil-based jet fuel. Importantly, it also allows for the production of eSAF, a synthetic version of SAF made using renewable electricity, green hydrogen, and captured carbon dioxide.

By 2030, EU regulations will require 1.2% of all SAF supplied to be synthetic, a share that will increase to 50% by 2050. The NorSAF plant’s integrated production model will meet both bio-based and synthetic SAF targets by combining bioethanol, green hydrogen generated via electrolysis and captured CO₂.

Vytautas Cekanavičius, CEO of Baltic Ground Services and NorSAF board member, noted: “We are developing a full green energy cycle – powering electrolysis with renewable electricity to generate hydrogen, then combining it with bioethanol and recycled CO₂ to produce SAF and eSAF. This makes our approach both sustainable and scalable.”

The site was selected for its strategic advantages, including existing infrastructure such as gas pipelines, railway access, ethanol handling facilities and plans for a nearby green hydrogen plant. Discussions are ongoing with potential suppliers of CO₂ to support the synthetic fuel production process.

A feasibility study conducted by KBR is due to be completed in late 2025, with construction expected to commence by 2027. According to Jānis Kisiels, board member at NorSAF, project timelines are on track:

“We are working closely with investors, suppliers and EU institutions to begin construction within two years. This facility positions Latvia at the forefront of the SAF industry while contributing to energy independence and green growth.”

Europe stands at a critical juncture in its journey toward a net zero aviation future. A recent unified appeal from stakeholders across the aviation and fuel industries signals both an opportunity and a challenge. The call is simple but urgent: policy makers must strengthen and accelerate support for the deployment of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, to meet the region’s climate ambitions.

While SAF remains a key lever for reducing the carbon footprint of air transport, its market development is still in its infancy. The only commercially viable option today—HEFA-based fuels—continues to face stiff cost competition from conventional kerosene. Meanwhile, next-generation options such as e-SAF and advanced biofuels are struggling to move from concept to investment reality.

Why the Industry Is Coming Together Now

Aviation associations, fuel suppliers, airports, and cargo operators have coalesced to issue a ten-point policy action plan aimed at catalysing the SAF market. Their message is clear: while the regulatory architecture exists in the form of the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, it is insufficient by itself. Legal mandates provide the structure, but financial and market support mechanisms are needed to provide the necessary scale and cost-efficiency.

The upcoming Sustainable Transport Investment Plan from the European Commission, due this autumn, is seen as a crucial moment to integrate these support mechanisms and align institutional strategy with commercial and environmental urgency.

The Cost Conundrum and Investment Gap

Even as the aviation sector commits to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, SAF developers face significant hurdles in securing long-term financing. In particular, the high upfront risk and capital requirements of SAF production technologies such as e-SAF make final investment decisions elusive.

The challenge is two-fold:

Bridging the cost gap between SAF and fossil-based kerosene.

Unlocking investment in infrastructure and technology at a pace fast enough to meet regulatory milestones.

Without market certainty and reliable demand signals, developers of innovative fuel technologies are unlikely to make the leap from pilot to plant.

Ten Actions for a Stronger SAF Ecosystem

The action plan presented to EU officials outlines a mix of regulatory, financial, and market-based measures to correct early-mover disadvantages and catalyse broader SAF uptake. Highlights include:

Extending SAF eligibility under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme in both volume and duration.

Launching dedicated funding calls for SAF innovation under existing EU instruments, including the Innovation Fund and the European Investment Bank.

Introducing a revenue certainty tool to mitigate offtake risks and encourage production commitments.

Developing a virtual ticketing mechanism to support SAF attribute trading, enhancing market liquidity and price transparency.

Reducing administrative burdens for smaller SAF producers and startups to help level the playing field.

These actions aim not just to address existing challenges, but to engineer a self-sustaining SAF value chain that balances investment risk with environmental reward.

Ensuring Equity and Regional Balance

A particularly compelling dimension of the industry’s call is the emphasis on equitable SAF access across European regions. As Montserrat Barriga of the European Regions Airline Association noted, uneven SAF distribution may skew public perception and exacerbate reputational disparities between operators.

Policy measures, therefore, must consider not only scale and cost but also inclusiveness—ensuring that regional carriers and less-developed airports are not left behind in the transition.

From Regulation to Strategy

The sentiment from industry is that SAF deployment cannot be addressed in isolation. It must be integrated into a holistic aviation strategy that spans aircraft innovation, air traffic management modernisation, and carbon removals. By broadening the lens, Europe can move from fragmented support to cohesive leadership in sustainable aviation.

The call for action represents more than an industry wish list—it is a roadmap for systemic change.

Conclusion: Why This Moment Matters

The aviation sector is not merely asking for policy favours. It is offering a vision where regulation, finance, and innovation align to create a high-growth, low-carbon fuel economy. This vision rests on the understanding that climate goals must be achieved in tandem with economic resilience and connectivity across Europe.

For stakeholders committed to sustainable mobility, this is the moment to watch. The coming months will likely determine whether Europe leads the SAF transition or lags behind global competitors.

As the conversation unfolds, it is important for all sectors—from technology to transport—to stay engaged and proactive. Cross-industry collaboration will be essential to turn policy frameworks into scalable solutions that redefine the future of flight.

Be part of the global conversation on decarbonising flight.

Reps. Mike Flood, R-Neb., and Troy A. Carter, Sr., D-La., on July 21 reintroduced the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Information Act. The bill directs the U.S. Energy Information Administration to more explicitly include SAF data in its weekly and monthly reports, in line with existing standards and consistent with other fuel types.

Flood and Carter introduced a previous version of the bill in August 2024. The current bill, H.R 4562, was referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce following its introduction.

The SAF Information Act directs the EIA to include data on SAF in its Petroleum Supply Month report and its Weekly Petroleum Status Report, including data related to the type, origin and volume of feedstock used in the production of SAF, along with the total amount of SAF produced domestically and imported.

“Nebraska remains a national leader in biofuel production and is a driving global leader in advancing the bioeconomy,” Flood said. “SAF represents just one of many promising ways to grow the biofuels sector and boost our rural communities. Our straightforward, commonsense bill requires the EIA to include SAF in its published data, giving industry leaders and stakeholders better insight into production trends. I’m grateful to my colleague for partnering with me once again to support the growth of the SAF industry.”

“Without coordinated action between government and industry, greenhouse gas emissions will continue to increase as more people and goods fly through our skies,” Carter added. “Sustainable aviation fuel is an exciting, new green fuel that’s creating jobs in Louisiana. I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation to ensure America is on track to meet the growing demand for cleaner transportation and healthier communities.”

Supporters of the SAF Information Act include the Advanced Biofuels Association, American Farm Bureau Federation, American Soybean Association, American Sugar Cane League, Greater New Orleans Inc., Growth Energy, Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation, National Corn Growers Association, National Oilseed Producers Association, Nebraska Corn Growers Association, Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation, Nebraska Soybean Association, Renewable Fuels Association, Renewable Fuels Nebraska, and the SAF Coalition.

“As we work to speed up the development and deployment of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), real-time production and supply updates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration will offer crucial insights,” said Alison Graab, executive director for the SAF Coalition. These updates will play a key role in effectively scaling up SAF across the country.”

“Transparent and timely market data are critically important to help the nascent SAF industry get off the ground, said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the RFA. “This legislation would ensure SAF producers and users have the information they need to make informed decisions and smart investments. The Renewable Fuels Association thanks Reps. Flood and Carter for their leadership on this issue and we strongly support their legislation,”

""America's farmers and biofuel producers will only be able to lead in global markets for clean fuels if we have reliable data to help guide investment decisions and measure our progress,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “Rep. Flood's bill is common sense and will lay the groundwork for new jobs and new investments, while giving the U.S. a way to track its path toward becoming the world leader in SAF production.”

“The Advanced Biofuels Association is proud to endorse the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Information Act and to play an important part in our nation’s energy dominance agenda,” said Michael McAdams, President of the Advanced Biofuels Association. “Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), also known as synthetic aviation fuel, is an in-demand U.S. energy export that is the latest in a long tradition of American renewable fuel innovations. This legislation will improve data streams from the U.S. Energy Information Administration that help our domestic farmers and biorefiners make informed decisions to increase SAF production levels.”

A new study by Deloitte for airlines for Europe, published recently on Green Air News, raised concerns that the ReFuelEU mandate, which requires increasing the use of sustainable aviation fuel, may drive passengers toward non-EU carriers and destinations that are not bound by the same environmental regulations.

The report warned that this could result in carbon and business leakage, undermining both climate goals and market fairness.

Deloitte estimated that ReFuelEU could increase cost disparities by up to 15 per cent on key EU–Asia routes by 2030.

As a solution, the study proposes a SAF Book and Claim Accounting Mechanism, which it said could help maintain a level playing field without raising overall prices for consumers.

The report identified the main types of leakage caused by the current policy framework including passengers choosing non-EU hubs like Istanbul or Dubai over EU hubs such as Paris or Frankfurt to avoid SAF costs; travelers opting for indirect routes outside the EU, since ReFuelEU applies only to the first flight segment departing from the EU; and EU travelers selecting non-EU holiday spots to avoid EU ETS costs, and non-EU residents bypassing EU destinations altogether.

While the EU already has a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism to price the carbon content of imports like cement and steel from countries with weaker climate rules, discussions are underway to possibly extend CBAM to aviation.

However, a 2024 analysis by Ishka notes this is complicated by the upcoming 2026 review of ICAO’s CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), which will assess whether the scheme aligns with the Paris Agreement targets.

The Deloitte report argued that applying CBAM to aviation is “neither legally nor practically feasible,” and called for a tailored solution for international air travel emissions.

The proposed SAF-BAM system, it said, should be established through EU legislation and enforced by national authorities.

It was added that the mechanism would rely on integrating passenger data with flight operations data to calculate SAF use per passenger and per flight segment.

“Revenue generated from the sale of SAF-BAM certificates could be dedicated to further support the aviation sector, including green transition projects,” the report added.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/15001652/European-Union-.jpg,N,,2025-07-23 01:18:32.319956

These regulations set ambitious targets to be fulfilled by aviation fuel suppliers; but given the expected high cost of SAF and the immature state of the industry, it is far from certain that sufficient fuel production capacity will be developed in time to hit near-term targets. It is anyway likely that there will be political pressure to reduce long-term targets.

Complementary policies have been developed to provide financial support to SAF on a ‘per litre’ basis, with the aim of facilitating uptake and/or production. The EU’s reimbursement scheme mitigates the cost to airlines for each unit of alternative fuel they consume by reimbursing some fraction of the cost difference compared to fossil kerosene. The UK’s guaranteed strike price (GSP), on the other hand, offers a Government-backed mechanism to shield SAF producers from variability in market prices, thereby establishing certainty over revenues and de-risking investment. The GSP seeks to provide reassurance to investors in early-stage commercial projects, facilitating finance availability in a way that is hoped to be effective in jump-starting production and reducing the cost of capital.

This report examines the SAF policy frameworks in the two regions and reviews their strengths and weaknesses. It finds that while the EU’s and the UK’s frameworks are currently the strongest incentives for SAF deployment in the world, both face challenges and the structure and targeting of their complementary support mechanisms will deliver diverging outcomes. We anticipate that the EU’s reimbursement scheme will primarily benefit airlines and reduce the costs to flyers, it will do little to provide a durable price signal to motivate more challenging second-generation fuel producers to enter the market; in contrast the UK’s GSP delivers clear and stable price certainty to fuel producers and is more likely to stimulate investment in the SAF industry.",https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_1465494506-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-23 01:18:36.111357

Reps. Mike Flood, R-Neb., and Troy A. Carter, Sr., D-La., on July 21 reintroduced the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Information Act. The bill directs the U.S. Energy Information Administration to more explicitly include SAF data in its weekly and monthly reports, in line with existing standards and consistent with other fuel types.

Flood and Carter introduced a previous version of the bill in August 2024. The current bill, H.R 4562, was referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce following its introduction.

The SAF Information Act directs the EIA to include data on SAF in its Petroleum Supply Month report and its Weekly Petroleum Status Report, including data related to the type, origin and volume of feedstock used in the production of SAF, along with the total amount of SAF produced domestically and imported.

“Nebraska remains a national leader in biofuel production and is a driving global leader in advancing the bioeconomy,” Flood said. “SAF represents just one of many promising ways to grow the biofuels sector and boost our rural communities. Our straightforward, commonsense bill requires the EIA to include SAF in its published data, giving industry leaders and stakeholders better insight into production trends. I’m grateful to my colleague for partnering with me once again to support the growth of the SAF industry.”

“Without coordinated action between government and industry, greenhouse gas emissions will continue to increase as more people and goods fly through our skies,” Carter added. “Sustainable aviation fuel is an exciting, new green fuel that’s creating jobs in Louisiana. I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation to ensure America is on track to meet the growing demand for cleaner transportation and healthier communities.”

Supporters of the SAF Information Act include the Advanced Biofuels Association, American Farm Bureau Federation, American Soybean Association, American Sugar Cane League, Greater New Orleans Inc., Growth Energy, Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation, National Corn Growers Association, National Oilseed Producers Association, Nebraska Corn Growers Association, Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation, Nebraska Soybean Association, Renewable Fuels Association, Renewable Fuels Nebraska, and the SAF Coalition.

“As we work to speed up the development and deployment of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), real-time production and supply updates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration will offer crucial insights,” said Alison Graab, executive director for the SAF Coalition. These updates will play a key role in effectively scaling up SAF across the country.”

17 UK companies developing sustainable aviation fuel to receive share of new £63 million funding boost, supporting around 1,400 jobs

latest investment builds on this year’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) drive, which will help position the UK as the world leader in homegrown sustainable aviation fuel production

latest investment supports greenlighting of multiple airport expansion schemes to kickstart economic growth and deliver on our Plan for Change

Passengers are a step closer to greener flights as the Aviation Minister today (22 July 2025) announced the 17 cutting-edge UK companies that will share £63 million to accelerate sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

The boost will support around 1,400 jobs and secure Britain’s position as the global leader in the green aviation market – critical to provide the clean fuel that’s essential to realise sustainable growth in the aviation sector.

Today’s investment means government has provided £198 million to date through the Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF) to scale up cleaner aviation technologies. Creating a clean aviation ecosystem will help power the next generation of airport infrastructure and capacity scale up, kickstarting economic growth and delivering the UK’s clean energy superpower ambitions to deliver on the Plan for Change.

Low carbon fuel production could add up to £5 billion to the economy by 2050, position the UK as a global hub for SAF production and enable the UK to go further and faster with expansion plans.

Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, said:

This £63 million is lift off for Britain’s green aviation revolution.

We’re not just backing brilliant British innovation, we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market.

From the labs of Sheffield to the runways of the future – this is how we kickstart economic growth, secure energy independence and make Britain a clean energy superpower.

SAF is an alternative to fossil jet fuel which reduces greenhouse gas emissions on average by 70% on a lifecycle basis, from feedstock to biofuel, making it the key technology that will allow UK aviation to grow capacity while achieving net zero commitments.

The SAF Bill will help secure the future of the aviation sector by boosting green fuel production in the UK and delivering cleaner flights. This bill will give investors the confidence to back sustainable aviation fuel production. It will help grow the sector, providing good green jobs and enabling the delivery of carbon savings.

Announcing the new funding at the University of Sheffield’s Energy Innovation Centre – which just received £1.5 million in this latest round – the Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, saw firsthand the groundbreaking work on aircraft engine testbeds and revolutionary aviation fuels.

Professor Mohamed Pourkashanian, Managing Director of the University of Sheffield’s Energy Innovation Centre, who is leading the project, said:

It is fantastic to see the University of Sheffield playing a leading role in the development of sustainable aviation fuel and supporting the aviation industry in its efforts to reduce its emissions.

At Sheffield, we have some of the most advanced SAF research facilities in Europe and are excited to work with partners from the industry to help them test and develop new fuels and next generation clean energy technologies.

The AFF winners include a range of companies and are spread across the country, such as OXCCU Tech, which is developing a demonstration plant at Oxford Airport, to LanzaJet, which is building a commercial-scale plant in Teesside.

Andrew Symes, CEO and Co-Founder of OXCCU, said:

Support from the Advanced Fuels Fund is a key step in scaling our technology.

This funding enables the detailed design and construction of OX2, our demonstration plant launching in 2026, and builds on the successful delivery of OX1. It brings us closer to producing lower-cost, lower-carbon aviation fuel and supports the UK’s ambition to become a global leader in SAF production.

Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet, said:

We’re proud that Project Speedbird, developed in partnership with British Airways, has been recognised by the Department for Transport as part of its continued commitment to advancing SAF in the UK.

This support demonstrates confidence in LanzaJet’s technology and the critical role ethanol-to-SAF can play in delivering economic growth, creating jobs and decarbonising air travel. Project Speedbird is vital to building a national SAF industry in the UK and to unlocking opportunity and innovation in the region.

We thank DfT for its leadership and vision in accelerating the transition to net-zero aviation.

However, rigid carbon intensity (CI) accounting procedures in current policies may limit CI responsiveness across candidate sites and facilities. This work examines a hypothetical biomass-to-sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) process to demonstrate how GHG accounting requirements drive estimates of biofuel CI and to explore potential CI and financial implications of scenario-specific life cycle assessment (LCA).

The CI of hypothetical SAF produced from miscanthus via the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) pathway was calculated according to specifications from three low carbon fuel policies (U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), Canada Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR), and California Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS)) and the 45Z tax credit. These were compared against modeling results tailored to specific feedstock-to-fuel scenarios (scenario-specific LCA) defined by feedstock and facility siting and feedstock split ratio (the proportion of miscanthus allocated to fuel production vs. electricity).

GHG accounting using the CFR/LCFS can reasonably account for distinct levels of net electricity production by a biorefinery, but only the CFR yields similar CI sensitivity to spatially explicit factors as scenario-specific LCA. Most GHG accounting frameworks do not capture CI variation across candidate sites in the United States.

This work demonstrates the importance of LCA methodological specifications in low carbon fuel policies and tax credits and illustrates that policies that enable scenario-specific CI calculations could enhance crediting accuracy and more effectively support implementation of low-emission practices.

Once the products hit the shelves, customers will see QIRA branding to identify it in stores.","EDDYVILLE – Iowa-grown corn will soon end up in the fibers of Spanx apparel and other products typically made with petroleum-based components, manufactured at a new facility at the Cargill plant in Eddyville.

Qore, the joint venture between Minnesota-based Cargill and Germany-based HELM AG, celebrated the opening of the $300 million facility Tuesday, and future growth it represents.

The facility will take sustainably grown corn from within the area, then grind it and process it into QIRA, which the company said is an “identical replacement” of 1,4-butanediol, a chemical component used to manufacture various polymers.

Officials with Qore and the partnering companies said the venture is a response to consumer demand for more sustainably produced products, but will also stoke the Iowa corn market and local economy, and pave the way for future partnerships to for bio-based alternatives to petroleum-derived products.

Jon Veldhouse, CEO of Qore, said Tuesday the project “connects” a “global challenge” with the natural process of corn absorbing CO2 and turning light into plant energy.

“It proves that scalable solutions can come from the ground up, that innovation can start with corn, that the products we use every day in fashion, footwear, personal care, electronics, automotive — they can be more responsible and serve a louder purpose,” Veldhouse said.

Extending the life of petroleum via bio-based solutions

Qore has already partnered with a number of brands, the first of which was Lycra, the original makers of Spandex materials.

Gary Smith, Lycra Company’s CEO, said with QIRA, he can provide a high level of product credibility and show consumers exactly where the corn in their yoga pants was grown.

But, he said the Qore partnership represents more than just a “sustainable story” he can communicate to consumers.

“It’s about a future where you don’t have to compromise on the standard of living that we’ve all come to know,” Smith said. “The ability to actually have renewable inputs that replace petrochemicals is huge.”

Smith said he hopes this is “the first step” in a future with many QIRA facilities around the world.

“It’s not if, it’s when fossil fuels run out,” Smith said. “We’ve done wonderful things of extending — fracking, horizontal drilling, shale oil, whatever — but there’s only so many dead dinosaurs in the ground.”

At full capacity, the Eddyville plant will have an annual demand of 100 million bushels of corn.

Steve Kuiper, an Iowa corn farmer growing for the facility, said that capacity would take all of his corn “plus a whole lot of other folks.’”

Plus, that corn would be sold at a premium since QIRA needs to be made with corn grown under regenerative farming practices, like cover cropping and reduced tillage.

Kuiper said he was already following these practices, but now that he has a designated market for his corn, it has made him “more mindful” of the practices.

Corn farmers have had low market prices the past several years and are looking for new markets that will give them a higher price per bushel, or to grow the market through things like Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

Kuiper said the QIRA market doesn’t fill the same gap as something like sustainable aviation fuel would, but he said “biochemistry is on everybody’s minds” and he said farmers, and consumers, need to advocate for more biochemical solutions.

“Those are direct replacements for petroleum products,” Kuiper said. “It’s going to do a couple of things – it’s better for the environment, but it’s also going to extend the life of petroleum.”

Axel Viering, an executive board member of the German chemical company HELM, said the partnership with Cargill and HELM represents a meeting of agriculture and chemicals.

“The vision of Qore is to produce and market something very special,” Viering said. “QIRA is the purest, the finest, the most sustainable product in its product category, and the goal is to position Qore as a lighthouse asset, globally, for sustainable solutions.”

Economic development

The plant in Eddyville is poised to produce 66,000 metric tons of QIRA annually, but the partners said they all hope demand for the product expands and more facilities will be needed.

Rep. Hans Wilz, R-Ottumwa, attended the ribbon cutting ceremony Tuesday and said he has driven past the Cargill plant, which opened 40 years ago in Eddyville, countless times and had friends who worked there. He said the Qore expansion is a reminder that the plant has a “much bigger footprint than most people understand.”

“It’s farmers growing corn, it’s people having jobs, but it’s also sustainability and a cleaner way to do things — even in our clothing now,” Wilz said. “…it’s cool to see how we fit in the process.”

Colleen May, president at Cargill’s Bioindustrial Group, said it’s difficult to calculate the economic impact of the plant because there are many connected supply chains.

During the Trump administration, there has been a shift away from sustainable projects, like Climate Smart agriculture and other project started by the Biden administration, in favor of promoting increased domestic production of fossil fuels.

May said in her conversations about Qore at the federal level, this change in mindset hasn’t been an issue. She said most Congress members agree on projects that support rural America.

“We’re emphasizing today more about economic development, particularly in the Midwest and that has been very very well received,” May said.

She said biosolutions represent an alternative for “conscious consumers” but there is “not enough agriculture to completely replace” petrochemicals, so the two will continue to coexist.

Now, PIT is poised to be among the first airports in the world to provide sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to commercial and cargo operators by producing it onsite at the airport.

Under an arrangement announced in late May, PIT has contracted Avina Synthetic Aviation Fuel (Avina) to build a state-of-the-art SAF production facility just south of its terminal.

Using a range of renewable feedstocks, the facility will produce ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials)-certified SAF by deploying an alcohol-to-jet technology known as PureSAF, which was developed by Swedish Biofuels AB and is exclusively licensed by KBR, a global provider of science, technology, and engineering solutions.

“The U.S. Air Force is already flying with it,” PIT chief executive officer Christina Cassotis said of the fully fungible military grade jet fuel produced by the innovative PureSAF process and validated by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

“We believe that it’s possible to not even have to blend that, that it could be 100% drop in so we’re looking forward to getting that plant built and operational because we know that SAF is the easiest thing to start with,” Cassotis said during the Future Travel Experience (FTE) World Innovation Summit at Carnegie Mellon University, two weeks before Avina was announced as PIT’s partner on the project.

Indeed, the SAF produced via the PureSAF process has “the same or, in some cases, better physical-chemical properties” as fossil jet fuel, according to KBR. Avina said the plant at PIT will have a carbon intensity that is “at least 65% lower than that of conventional jet fuel.”

Because of PureSAF’s feed flexibility — it can use renewable alcohol, synthesis gas (syngas), or carbon dioxide — the resulting SAF is billed by KBR as being more cost competitive than alternative offerings which require separate technologies for conversion of ethanol and gases.

Sitting on 8,800 acres, of which 25-30% has yet to be developed, PIT certainly has the land to accommodate the new SAF production facility, which will be spread across 50 acres. “And we have pipeline access to the [Ohio] River, which means whatever we produce can be barged to other markets,” Cassotis noted.

Moreover, she said of the Pittsburgh region, “we sit in the middle of millions of acres of bio-based feedstock.” This ensures that SAF can be produced at “a much more cost competitive price point, which we hope will be interesting in the industry.”

With plans to produce over 100 million gallons of SAF annually, through multiple phases of development, the facility could open as soon as 2028, enabling PIT’s airline partners to secure SAF readily and cost-effectively, whilst meeting their decarbonization targets. The SAF hub will also “meet local and regional commercial and cargo needs at PIT and beyond,” said the airport.

Elsewhere KBR’s PureSAF technology platform has been selected by Renewable Developments Australia (RDA), in collaboration with Virgin Australia and Qatar Airways to establish a SAF production facility in the Charters Towers Region of North Queensland, Australia. “Here, bioethanol derived from sugarcane grown onsite will be converted to 100% SAF utilizing the ethanol-to-jet pathway,” KBR said.

Meanwhile, PIT’s work to economically viable SAF has only just begun. During the FTE summit, Cassotis revealed that the airport is also investigating a SAF pathway using sludge, the output of sewage treatment plants, to convert into fuel cost-effectively. “One of the biggest things that we see is the cost of producing this green fuel. So, we are looking at that; we have looked at distributed hydrogen projects,” she noted. And under the last administration, PIT explored a pathway to coal mine methane being converted into SAF.

Avina explains the PureSAF process in the following video.

That’s where thermal process equipment comes in. From preheating and cooling to waste heat recovery, systems like shell and tube heat exchangers and economizers play a critical role in aviation fuel processing.

Let’s break down how this equipment helps refine aviation fuel—and why it matters for engineers and operators alike.

How Thermal Process Equipment Powers Aviation Fuel Processing

In aviation fuel refining—often part of larger distillation or hydroprocessing systems—precise heat control is everything. That’s where thermal process equipment comes in. These systems handle heating, cooling, and energy recovery at nearly every stage of the process, making them indispensable for efficiency, safety, and product quality.

Key Equipment and What It Does:

Shell and Tube Heat Exchangers: Foundational to efficient heat management in fuel processing, these exchangers allow one fluid to flow through internal tubes while another circulates around them within the shell—facilitating reliable heat transfer. They’re used throughout the process for preheating fuel, condensing vapors, and cooling product before storage or blending.

Preheaters: By warming up aviation fuel before it enters distillation towers or hydrotreaters, preheaters reduce viscosity, improve flow, and ease the load on primary heating systems.

Condensers: Volatile hydrocarbons in fuel can vaporize during refining. Condensers convert these vapors back into liquid using coolants—capturing valuable components, enhancing safety, and avoiding environmental concerns from vapor discharge.

Coolers: Once processing is complete, hot fluids need to be cooled to safe temperatures. Shell and tube exchangers function as coolers here, using chilled water or glycol to prep fuel for storage or downstream steps.

Economizers: These units recover waste heat—often from flue gas or other hot process streams—and use it to preheat incoming fluids, saving energy and cutting fuel costs.

Supporting Sustainability with Aviation Biofuels

As aviation shifts toward more sustainable operations, bio-based fuels—such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)—are becoming a critical part of the fuel mix. While these fuels can be processed in existing infrastructure, they come with different thermal and chemical characteristics.

Thermal process equipment design and selection play a key role in:

Adapting to Feedstock Variability: Biofuels may be derived from biomass, animal fats, or even used cooking oil, all of which require fine-tuned temperature control during processing.

Meeting Regulatory Targets: Shell and tube heat exchangers and economizers help reduce emissions and energy use—supporting compliance with carbon reduction goals from organizations like the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

Maximizing Yield and Quality: Proper heat management ensures that SAF meets strict performance standards for commercial aviation. Downtime is avoided through the design of equipment that is robust, easy to quickly maintain, and simple to monitor for performance.

Whether refining traditional jet fuel or advanced biofuels, the same principles apply: efficient heat transfer and energy recovery are essential for both economic and environmental performance.

Operational Best Practices for Thermal Equipment

When it comes to aviation fuel processing, small choices in equipment, maintenance, and monitoring can have a big impact on efficiency, safety, and reliability. Here’s how to stay ahead:

Select the Right Equipment: Materials, flow rates, temperature range, and pressure ratings all matter. Stainless steel exchangers, for example, are a good fit for aviation fuel due to their corrosion resistance.

Maintain It Regularly: Cleaning fouled tubes and inspecting for leaks or corrosion keeps heat exchangers running efficiently.

Monitor the Process: Temperature and flow sensors can help detect issues early and allow for real-time adjustments.

Train Your Team: Equipment is only as good as the people running it. Keep teams informed on best practices for performance and safety.

Fueling the Future of Aviation

Aviation fuel processing is high-stakes and high-precision—and the right thermal process equipment makes all the difference. Whether you’re engineering the system or purchasing components, shell and tube heat exchangers and economizers play vital roles in refining reliable, high-quality fuel.

And as the industry moves toward more sustainable aviation biofuels, thermal process equipment isn’t just helpful—it’s essential. It’s not just about heat—it’s about performance, reliability, and staying ahead of the curve in an industry that never stands still.

The UK Department for Transport has confirmed 17 SAF production companies that will benefit from multi-million pound investment.

UK aviation minister Mike Kane has confirmed a £63 million investment in 17 innovative companies to advance the production of domestic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

The investment is part of the UK government’s Advanced Fuel Funds (AFF) competition, which was initiated in July 2022, to scale up cleaner aviation technologies. The government has so far provided £198 million through the fund, with the latest announcement marking the third window of funding.

AFF competition winners

The winning companies include Oxford-based start-up, OXCCU Tech, which was awarded £3.1 million towards developing a demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport. Meanwhile, LanzaJet, which is building a commercial-scale plant in South Wales was awarded £10 million and LanzaTech was awarded £6.4 million for its commercial scale SAF plants.

Other winners include Alfanar Energy, Altalto, British Sugar, Carbon Neutral Fuels, Equilibrion, Equinor Low Carbon UK, Essar Oil/ EET Fuels, ETFuels UK, LanzaTech, NorthPointe Energy, Power2X Solutions, SuMo Engineering, University of Sheffield – which boasts some of the most advanced SAF research facilities in Europe, Willis Sustainable Fuels and Zero Petroleum.

Why investment is key to scaling SAF technologies

According to Andrew Symes, CEO and co-founder of OXCCU, the investment is a key step in scaling its technology. “This funding enables the detailed design and construction of OX2, our demonstration plant launching in 2026, and builds on the successful delivery of OX1.”

Founded in 2021, the cleantech startup is developing highly efficient and inexpensive iron-based catalysts for direct conversion of recycled carbon dioxide and green hydrogen into jet fuels and plastics.

Traditional biofuels face challenges when it comes to scaling production, including limited feedstocks and the need for hydrocarbons to be created without the use of fossil fuels. While e-fuels or synthetic fuels based on CO2 have huge potential to scale with fewer feedstock constraints, they do face constraints due to costs. By consolidating the traditional e-hydrocarbons production process from two steps down to a one-step direct hydrogenation process, OXCCU offers a cost-effective solution.

Meanwhile, Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet expressed his delight that Project Speedbird, developed in partnership with British Airways, has also been recognised by the Department for Transport. The UK’s first ethanol-to-SAF facility, Project Speedbird uses LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet technology to convert second-generation ethanol, produced from sources including agricultural residues and woody biomass, into SAF.

“This support demonstrates confidence in LanzaJet’s technology and the critical role ethanol-to-SAF can play in delivering economic growth, creating jobs and decarbonising air travel. Project Speedbird is vital to building a national SAF industry in the UK and to unlocking opportunity and innovation in the region.”

Boosting the UK as a global hub for SAF production

Kane underlined that low carbon fuel production could add £5 billion to the economy by 2050 and position the UK as a global hub for SAF production. He also noted that creating a clean aviation ecosystem will help kickstart the next generation of airport infrastructure and capacity.

“We’re not just backing British innovation, we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market,” he said.

“From the labs of Sheffield to the runways of the future – this is how we kickstart economic growth, secure energy independence, and make Britain a clean energy superpower.”

Accelerating the availability and affordability of SAF

Earlier this month European aviation stakeholders including airports, airlines and regulators, highlighted that need to accelerate the availability and affordability of SAF. With aviation critical to providing vital connectivity and supporting socio-economic growth, SAF is widely accepted as being critical to achieving the industry’s net zero target.

However, transitioning to a net zero industry requires substantial investment to develop and deploy SAF at scale, upgrade infrastructure and support technological innovations within the industry. EU demand for SAF requires the construction of around 12 new industrial-scale first-of-a-kind e-SAF plants by 2050.

The UK’s AFF third funding window comes at a crucial time as industry stakeholders call for decisive policy action to support a timely and robust ramp-up of SAF across Europe. Key priorities include accelerating the development of new SAF projects and plants, increasing feedstock availability, and introducing a revenue certainty instrument to address the offtake mismatch between long-term production commitments and short-term demand.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-22-at-18.32.05.png,N,,2025-07-22 14:56:25.096640

Production with a capacity of approximately 100,000 tons of SAF per year is planned to begin in 2030, making the NorSAF plant the largest SAF production facility in Northern Europe. Its costs are estimated at 500-600 million euros, depending on the chosen technological solution. As this project will compete on a global scale, its successful implementation depends on the assistance and support it will receive from the European Union, institutional investors and government authorities.

Often referred to as the future of aviation, SAF produces significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions than conventional jet fuel. From the beginning of this year, the European Union has introduced a requirement that at least 2% of all fuel consumed at airports must be SAF. This requirement will gradually increase, reaching 6% by 2030, 20% by 2035 and 70% by 2050. Gediminas Ziemelis, founder and chairman of the board of Avia Solutions Group, points out that the further development of the aviation industry will be directly related to new sustainability standards.

This ambitious project is the group's first step in the field of aviation fuel production. The group's subsidiary ""Baltic Ground Services"", which has extensive experience in the supply and distribution of SAF, has been selected to implement the technological part.

The new production facility will use PureSAF technology, developed by ""Swedish Biofuels AB"" and exclusively licensed by the US engineering firm ""KBR"". This technology has been proven to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 93% compared to conventional jet fuel.

...

""It should be noted that by 2030, another important condition will come into force: 1.2% of all SAF fuel supplied will have to be synthetic. This type of fuel is produced without using biological components. Instead, green energy is used to produce hydrogen, which is then mixed with carbon dioxide. This requirement will also gradually increase, and by 2050, half of all SAF fuel will have to be synthetic. So, changes in the aviation industry are already happening at full speed,"" says Vytautas Cekanavicius, CEO of Baltic Ground Services and member of the board of NorSAF.

Using PureSAF technology, NorSAF will be able to produce both SAF and eSAF (synthetic fuel derived from renewable energy) from bioethanol, hydrogen and captured CO2, with the full green energy cycle becoming the main feature of the project. Green electricity will power electrolysis to produce green hydrogen, which will then be combined with captured CO₂ and ethanol to create both SAF and eSAF. The use of the resulting CO2 in fuel production will be particularly beneficial for the environment.

KBR is conducting a feasibility study, which is planned to be completed by the second half of 2025. Work on the project is expected to begin soon after.

(Skokie, Ill.) announced it has received a grant of £6.4 million from the UK government’s Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF), operated by the Department for Transport (DfT).
The grant will accelerate the development of LanzaTech’s DRAGON 1 & 2 projects, each playing a crucial role in the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the UK.
Project DRAGON stands for Decarbonizing and Reimagining Aviation for the Goal Of Netzero.
“Our commitment to enabling cleaner jet fuel is bolstered by the UK government’s continued support and confidence in LanzaTech as a leader in the sector.
By leveraging low-cost, sustainable inputs for SAF production, LanzaTech is poised to play a key role in aiding the aviation sector’s pursuit of its net-zero commitments.","LanzaTech Global, Inc. (Skokie, Ill.) announced it has received a grant of £6.4 million from the UK government’s Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF), operated by the Department for Transport (DfT).

The grant will accelerate the development of LanzaTech’s DRAGON 1 & 2 projects, each playing a crucial role in the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the UK. Project DRAGON stands for Decarbonizing and Reimagining Aviation for the Goal Of Netzero.

The DRAGON 1 project is LanzaTech’s existing U.K. SAF project that will convert recycled carbon fuel ethanol (including ethanol from LanzaTech’s gas fermentation process) into Advanced SAF in Port Talbot, South Wales, using the LanzaJet Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) process.

The DRAGON 2 project is a Power-to-Liquid (PtL) facility that will convert waste carbon dioxide and green hydrogen into ethanol for subsequent conversion into PtL SAF at an adjacent facility using the LanzaJet Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) process. The location for DRAGON 2 in the UK will be determined during this grant-funded project.

Integrating LanzaTech’s gas fermentation process with LanzaJet’s AtJ technology gives this approach a distinctive edge. By turning regional waste resources into valuable SAF, LanzaTech facilitates the production of low Carbon Intensity (CI) fuels, contributing positively to the UK’s SAF Mandate and supporting economic growth and job creation in industrial zones in the UK.

“The future of aviation fuel is ethanol-to-SAF and LanzaTech is at the forefront,” said Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech. “Our commitment to enabling cleaner jet fuel is bolstered by the UK government’s continued support and confidence in LanzaTech as a leader in the sector. This funding not only affirms the value of our unique technology and feedstock approach but also propels our mission to integrate air travel into a circular carbon economy. DRAGON 1 & 2 are set to drive the global SAF market forward and exemplify the UK’s commitment to leading SAF innovation on the global stage.”

The UK government’s significant investment in these projects underscores their confidence in LanzaTech’s proven, commercial-scale technology and its potential to substantially boost the UK’s SAF production. This endorsement not only solidifies LanzaTech’s reputation as a leader in advancing global clean energy initiatives but also emphasizes the crucial role of feedstock providers. By leveraging low-cost, sustainable inputs for SAF production, LanzaTech is poised to play a key role in aiding the aviation sector’s pursuit of its net-zero commitments.

Separately, Project Speedbird by LanzaJet, in which LanzaTech holds a 36% ownership stake, also received recognition and £10 million in funding from the Advanced Fuels Fund, further testament to the government’s trust in the Lanza technology portfolio. In 2024, LanzaTech and LanzaJet partnered to create CirculAir™, that transforms nearly any form of waste carbon (including CO2, MSW, agri residues) into SAF, combining the groundbreaking technologies of both companies to provide the aviation industry with a solution to produce waste-based SAF on a global scale.

This allocation boosts total government contributions through the Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF) to £198 million, aimed at expanding cleaner aviation technologies. This strategic investment is a testament to the UK government’s comprehensive approach to environmental strategies, aligning with initiatives like the recently enacted SAF Mandate. This funding round notably supports a broad spectrum of pathways and feedstocks for SAF production—an inclusive move by the UK government that recognizes the need for varied solutions in the pursuit of net-zero aviation.",https://www.chemengonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ce-sm-logo-400x400-sb.jpg,N,,2025-07-22 18:56:18.063578

A “clerical error” led to one-way tickets — which usually sell for approximately $500 — being listed for $1,800 to $2,000 on Canadian North’s website Monday, said Lauren D’Oliveira, an airline spokesperson.
D’Oliveira said it might take some time for the website to update, but early Monday afternoon it still listed the wrong prices.
Canadian North was recently acquired by Exchange Income Corp. Its chief executive officer, Mike Pyle, promised the sale would not drive up the airline’s fares.
In 2023, the department announced conditions for Canadian North’s 2019 merger with First Air that included a 25 per cent cap on annual fare increases.","Alex McConnachie couldn’t believe his eyes: When he checked Canadian North’s website Monday morning, it said the price of a one-way ticket from Ottawa to Iqaluit had more than tripled to approximately $2,000.

“I’m a hostage to these fares,” said McConnachie, who lives in Iqaluit and shares custody of his 12-year-old son with his ex-wife, who lives in Halifax. Under their custody agreement, McConnachie has to pay for the plane ticket for his son to travel to visit his mother regardless of how much the ticket costs.

“So if they say that flight is $9,000, I have to pay it,” he said, adding that a drastic increase in Canadian North prices would mean that simply fulfilling his duties as a father might drive him deep into debt.

Turns out, it was all a false alarm.

A “clerical error” led to one-way tickets — which usually sell for approximately $500 — being listed for $1,800 to $2,000 on Canadian North’s website Monday, said Lauren D’Oliveira, an airline spokesperson.

D’Oliveira said it might take some time for the website to update, but early Monday afternoon it still listed the wrong prices.

“We can confirm a configuration error during a recent system update did affect fares that would have been visible on our website,” said Pam Plaster, vice-president for investor development for Exchange Income Corp., the airline’s owner.

She said fares are not being increased.

Plaster said Canadian North will contact passengers, such as McConnachie, who already booked flights at the incorrect prices to issue “appropriate refunds.”

D’Oliveira said she didn’t know the exact number of passengers who will receive a refund or when the incorrect prices first appeared on the website.

Canadian North was recently acquired by Exchange Income Corp. Its chief executive officer, Mike Pyle, promised the sale would not drive up the airline’s fares.

News that the price hike was an error came as relief to McConnachie.

He said the panic he and other Nunavummiut experienced reminded him of a long-running joke that the North’s dominant airline’s motto should be: “Canadian North — what are you gonna do, walk?”

“It’s not like we have other options,” McConnachie said.

Doubling the price of tickets would have contravened the orders of Transport Canada, the federal department responsible for national transportation policies and programs.

Vivergo outlines hopes for UK bioethanol plant rescue

London, 21 July (Argus) — UK bioethanol producer Vivergo is proceeding with plans to close its 416mn litres/yr Saltend plant in eastern England, but has outlined ways the government could prevent this. Vivergo has said deliveries of wheat will cease at the end of July, and redundancies will begin in August, ahead of closure in September . It already said it had stopped buying wheat in June . The decision to close was made by Vivergo's parent company, food and ingredients group Associated British Foods (ABF), after a US-UK trade deal agreed in May that allowed duty-free imports of up to 1.4bn l/yr of US ethanol. ABF confirmed at the end of June that it was in talks with the government, but no timeline has been put on the process. The first stage of the talks was for UK producers, like Vivergo and Ensus, operator of the 400mn l/yr Wilton bioethanol refinery in northeast England, to submit their strategic business cases. Ensus has said it could close Wilton. Covering costs Vivergo told Argus it wants the government to cover losses of £3mn/month, or £35mn/yr, which it said have been incurred as a result of government decisions. Previously, ABF proposed a support package of £75mn/yr , for up to two years, for the entire UK sector. In the longer-term, Vivergo said there is appetite from private investors to finance future projects. It pointed to a recent initial agreement to supply ethanol for a prospective alcohol-to-jet sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant planned by hydrogen developer Meld Energy at Saltend. Meld told Argus that while the project will be ""underpinned by government support mechanisms"", the ""longer term plan is to eventually eliminate reliance on subsidy through reducing cost of production which will likely be through scale, efficiency and technology advancement"". Meld chief executive Chris Smith also told Argus that sourcing bioethanol directly from Vivergo helped ""risk management"". He said locally-produced bioethanol brings ""greater certainty of supply"" and ""reduces local infrastructure requirements."" Vivergo said failure to support the bioethanol sector would be ""shortsighted"", because in order to meet projected increases in UK SAF demand by 2035 the country would need ""seven more Vivergos"", or a more than 3.5 times increase in domestic bioethanol production. Regulation frustration Vivergo said another key way for the government to help is to tackle the eligibility of unrefined liquid dextrose ultrafiltration retentate (Uldur) for double counting under the UK's renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO). Uldur, which is classfied in the UK as a waste ethanol feedstock, makes up a significant share of the total import pool from the US. Biofuels made from certain raw materials classed as ""wastes"" and ""residues"" under the RTFO receive double the amount of renewable transport fuel certificates (RTFCs) for every litre of fuel produced. RTFCs are tradeable credits primarily generated by the sale of biofuel-blended fuels and are used to help obligated parties meet the RTFO mandate. Vivergo says Uldur-derived ethanol is a co-product of the wet milling process rather than waste, and its eligibility for double counting is inconsistent with the RTFO's decarbonisation aims. It said producers using Uldur are able to make double-counting bioethanol using a more carbon-intensive production process than the fermentation of wheat, yet crop-based ethanol produced by Vivergo is ineligible for double counting. Vivergo said producers of double counting product get an additional certificate worth around £260/t, meaning it is unable compete with the low prices of Uldur-based bioethanol importers from the US. And these will now be able to enter the UK duty free under the new US-UK trade deal. The UK government is consulting on whether to continue classing Uldur as eligible for double counting. Other changes proposed by Vivergo include increasing the ethanol mandate in road fuel, from E10 to E15 or E20. Vivergo previously said an E15 mandate could boost demand in the UK by 660mn l/yr. It also highlighted the potential for increased bioethanol use in marine and aviation sectors. Capturing the moment Another key point in the talks with the government is the capture of CO2, a by-product of bioethanol production, Vivergo said. The company said it is 6-9 months away from having carbon capture facilities ready, at which point it would be capable of meeting around a third of the UK's 600,000 t/yr CO2 demand. Ensus captures 250,000 t/yr of CO2 at its 400mn l/yr bioethanol refinery in Wilton, northeast England. Vivergo said losing this would mean increased CO2 imports, and noted its output of high-protein animal feed as a co-product of wheat-to-ethanol production, which agricultural firms would otherwise have to import at a higher environmental cost. The National Farmers Union has previously said that losing the UK bioethanol industry would be a ""huge blow"", as it currently has the ""capacity to purchase around 2mn t of wheat each year"", so without it ""farmers would lose a reliable market for their feed wheat.""

The money will be shared by 17 UK-based companies, which are all involved in producing what the aviation industry calls sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The successful applicants for the funding include LanzaJet, which is building the Project Speedbird plant to convert ethanol into aviation fuel in Teesside in partnership with British Airways. Lanzajet is receiving £10 million from the government for this project, as well as another£6.4 million for two other production sites in the UK.

Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet, said: “This support demonstrates confidence in LanzaJet’s technology and the critical role ethanol-to-SAF can play in delivering economic growth, creating jobs and decarbonising air travel. Project Speedbird is vital to building a national SAF industry in the UK and to unlocking opportunity and innovation in the region.”

Other firms to receive funding include OXCCU Tech, which is developing a “demonstration” plant at Oxford Airport to convert green hydrogen into SAF, and Sheffield University for its research helping the aviation industry to test and develop new fuels and clean energy technologies.

The grants are the third “window” of funding through the government’s Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF), which has now provided a total of £198 million in investment towards the development of alternative aviation fuels.

UK aviation minister Mike Kane said: “We’re not just backing brilliant British innovation, we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market.”

Alternative aviation fuels can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70 per cent over the lifecycle of the fuel compared with traditional kerosene-based fuel.

The UK has introduced its SAF mandate this year, which requires at least 2 per cent of the overall aviation fuel mix from flights to be from sustainable sources in 2025. This percentage will increase to 10 per cent by 2030.

Co-located with the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Summit and the Biofuels International Conference & Expo, the 2025 International Biogas Congress & Expo provided a comprehensive platform for stakeholders to collaborate and drive the future of biogas forward.

This report delves into the key takeaways from the conference, examining the latest trends, challenges and opportunities within the biogas industry.

Policy momentum and market growth

Grazia Vascello, policy officer at the European Biogas Association (EBA), offered a comprehensive overview of the policy developments and market trajectory shaping Europe’s biogas and biomethane sectors. Representing more than 50 national associations and research bodies, the EBA plays a central role in promoting the interests of the bioenergy industry within EU institutions.

Vascello outlined four key policy priorities. First, the European Commission's strategic agenda continues to emphasise energy security and competitiveness, positioning biomethane as a core solution to reducing dependence on Russian gas.

Second, RePowerEU and the revised Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) are accelerating legislative support for renewable gases, mandating national plans to boost alternatives like biogas.

Third, the 2040 climate targets will shape emissions trajectories and influence future updates to EU energy legislation.

Lastly, she emphasised the importance of the EU Forest Strategy and emerging carbon capture pathways, where biogas can offer unique contributions.

Market growth is robust. In 2023, biomethane production approached 5 billion cubic metres – a remarkable 80% year-on-year increase – with leading contributions from France, Denmark and the UK.

The EU now hosts more than 1,300 operational plants, 85% of which are grid-connected. Newer facilities are increasingly using sustainable feedstocks such as agricultural residues and waste, rather than energy crops.

Investment momentum is also strong. In 2023, €2.7 billion was invested in the sector, with 150 additional plants expected to come online over the next five years. Countries like Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Poland are emerging as attractive markets for new development.

Biogas in the Arctic

Simon Ford, director of technical development at Rå Biopark, delivered an insightful presentation on the challenges and breakthroughs of building biogas infrastructure in Northern Norway – one of Europe’s most remote and logistically complex regions.

Drawing on his experience leading a multi-municipal initiative in Troms and Finnmark, Ford explained how strategic collaboration is transforming fragmented organic waste into a reliable, renewable energy source.

Historically, the region lacked both the scale and infrastructure to support viable biogas production. However, by coordinating public-sector waste operators across a territory larger than Belgium, Rå Biopark consolidated 15,000 tonnes of household organic waste, supplemented by input from breweries, agriculture, and Norway’s expanding aquaculture industry. The latter is shifting northward, creating new opportunities – and pressures – for sustainable waste management.

With no gas grid in place, the project is focusing on biomethane for transport. Thanks to high diesel prices and favourable tax treatment, renewable gas is an increasingly attractive alternative. The Norwegian government is co-financing three to four new fuelling stations to support heavy goods vehicle adoption.

Digestate management, a common challenge in remote areas, is being tackled through evaporation towers and wet pyrolysis, producing condensed, transportable outputs such as ammonia for industrial use. A new site – co-located with a waste incineration facility – will enable heat integration and improve logistical efficiency.

Ford underlined that this success would not have been possible without public-private cooperation, technical adaptability, and long-term commitment. What began as a scattered, low-volume waste system is now a scalable circular economy model for rural and Arctic regions – delivering climate benefits, local value and enhanced energy security in an area where few had imagined it could succeed.

Trading in Europe

Lucas Oliveira, from Engie’s Global Energy Management biomethane trading desk, gave a detailed account of the operational and regulatory complexity behind scaling up Europe’s biomethane trade.

Speaking on behalf of one of Europe’s largest gas trading companies, Oliveira stressed Engie’s ambition to reach 10 TWh of biomethane production by 2030, backed by €3 billion in investment.

With over 500 contracts with small producers in France alone, and trading activity spanning nine countries, Engie faces immense logistical and data management challenges in handling guarantees of origin (GOs), proof of sustainability (PoS) and gas molecules.

Oliveira underscored the fragmented nature of the European biomethane market. Registry systems, accepted feedstocks, certification schemes, units of measurement and data formats all vary from country to country. These discrepancies make cross-border trading technically difficult and administratively burdensome.

As a trader, Engie must reconcile the different requirements of voluntary and national sustainability schemes, convert units (such as heating values at varying temperatures) and match supply to diverse client demands – whether for waste-derived gas, RED II compliance, or specific PoS criteria.

To cope, Engie developed an internal digital tool named METAPoS. It tracks deliveries, automates data transposition between certification schemes (e.g. 2BSvs and ISCC), manages inventory and generates audit-ready mass balance reports.

Oliveira described how this tool helps ensure compliance, avoid double counting and unlock market value – particularly important given the increasing scale and complexity of their portfolio.

Looking ahead, Oliveira highlighted the need for harmonisation at EU level, not only to streamline administrative burden and reduce manual errors, but to open up cross-border market liquidity. He noted that pending legislation under the Union Database for gaseous fuels (UDB) may help standardise data flows. Until then, large players like Engie are building their own digital infrastructure to make sense of a highly heterogeneous market.

Nordic know-how

Ari Suomilammi, head of renewable gases at Gasum, offered an in-depth look into the challenges and opportunities of biomethane sourcing and trading in the Nordic region.

With extensive experience spanning nearly eight years in biomethane production and decades managing gas permissions, Suomilammi outlined Gasum’s integrated role in Finland, Sweden and Norway’s gas ecosystem.

As a state-owned company, Gasum delivers natural gas primarily in liquid form alongside biomethane and provides energy market services including power management. Its ecosystem encompasses biogas production support for agriculture, multiple import terminals for liquid biomethane, a network of about 20 biogas plants, and over 100 gas filling stations.

Suomilammi emphasised the rising demand for biomethane, particularly in the transport sector, driven by a combination of domestic production and imports from across Europe.

Gasum structures long-term sourcing contracts, often up to ten years, blending biomethane with grey gas in a “bio premium” model that balances sustainability with market realities. Emerging areas like biomethane from waste and bio-based CO2 are being explored, though volumes remain modest.

A key point was the complexity of operating within fragmented regulations and a lack of standardised markets. Biomethane premiums vary by country and registry, and unlike traditional commodities, biomethane trading faces challenges in pricing transparency, risk management and accounting.

Suomilammi identified major risks as market exposure through open positions, counterpart risk in long-term agreements, and regulatory uncertainty, which can abruptly impact sourcing and sales.

Gasum manages these risks through fixed-price sourcing contracts and hedging the grey gas component, while carefully controlling open positions based on company strength.

Logistics also present challenges, with delivery involving injection into gas grids, liquefaction and shipping where pipeline networks are limited. Suomilammi concluded that while the European biomethane market remains nascent and complex, demand growth, especially in transportation, underscores the need for regulatory harmonisation to unlock its full potential.

Certifying biomethane

Tim Hamers, secretary general of the European Renewable Gas Registry (ERGaR), spoke about the current challenges and opportunities in certifying and trading biomethane and biogenic carbon dioxide (bio-CO2) across Europe.

He highlighted the fragmented certification landscape that currently exists, with different frameworks depending on the gas’s source and end use – such as carbon removal, renewable energy directives or voluntary markets – which complicates cross-border trade and risks double counting.

Hamers stressed that certification is a key part of the solution to unlocking the market for bio-CO2 and biomethane, gases produced from biogas plants and bio-refineries with diverse applications ranging from beverage carbonation to fuels and greenhouse use. The complexity increases due to multiple use cases and varying certification requirements, often resulting in additional administrative burden without added benefit.

ERGaR advocates for a harmonised, single certification system that would streamline processes, prevent double counting and provide clarity and trust for producers, buyers and regulators. He explained ongoing efforts to connect Guarantees of Origin registries with the European Union’s central database, aiming to improve transparency and ease market operations.

Hamers also discussed regulatory developments, including incentives and certification rules for aviation fuels and the importance of upcoming delegated acts expected to clarify these frameworks. He emphasised the importance of harmonisation and registry integration as critical steps towards enabling a more efficient and credible market for renewable gases in Europe.

Optimising carbon intensity

Roland Kok, founder of Route to Market, highlighted that many biogas producers make avoidable mistakes during on-site biogas or biomethane production, but these can be transformed into valuable optimisations.

A key area is the use of disaggregated feedstock meeting regulatory standards (MERs), including dry or processed manures such as chicken manure or thick fractions of cattle manure. Optimising transport values – especially for feedstock with low dry matter content – can significantly improve efficiency and carbon intensity. Properly aggregating and using actual measured values of feedstock quality often yields better results than default values.

Kok pointed out that emissions estimates from biogas processing and upgrading are often overly conservative. By using actual methane emission measurements, producers can lower carbon intensity and increase compliance benefits.

Additionally, biogas production bonuses – around 25 cubic metres of biogas per tonne of manure – can be claimed if yields exceed this benchmark.

Interestingly, sourcing feedstock from farther distances is allowed when regulations are followed and auditors informed, offering strategic flexibility. Stable feedstock supply is essential for investor confidence, and thoughtful feedstock allocation can optimise carbon scores.

Administrative optimisations include reducing methane leaks, applying lower emission factors where justified and improving transport fuels like HVO. Increasing dry matter content or capturing C2 gases can improve carbon intensity but may increase operational costs.

Kok also stressed careful management of CO2 capture credits, as environmental attributes cannot be double-counted. Overall, he noted that optimising carbon intensity goes beyond regulatory compliance – it’s a strategic imperative to create value and competitiveness in evolving carbon markets. Producers must engage smartly with carbon intensity metrics to thrive in future biogas sectors.

The growing role of private equity

Khash Mohajerani, co-founder and partner at OrbeNovo Capital, outlined the appeal and challenges of private equity investment in the biogas sector, particularly across Western Europe. OrbeNovo specialises in energy investments and currently manages an £80 million capital investment in the UK biogas platform EAG Bio Energy.

Mohajerani highlighted biogas as a compelling sector due to its unique ability to provide modular, clean energy that complements intermittent renewables like wind and solar. He pointed out the strong EU policy support targeting a 10-fold increase in biogas production by 2030, alongside a focus on domestic energy security – advantages that attract private equity interest.

The sector is evolving from a fragmented landscape of small, farm-based operations to larger, professionalised platforms that can deliver scalable, cash-generative businesses. Private equity firms prioritise investing in experienced management teams with proven track records, favouring platform-building over one-off asset purchases.

Feedstock price stability and a clear regulatory environment are vital, though Mohajerani warned about the practical limits of long-term feedstock contracts with farmers.

Business models vary from lower-risk acquisitions of operating assets – yielding 11-14% returns – to greenfield development projects with higher capital but similar returns. The sector’s complexity, including risks around feedstock, operational efficiency and permitting delays, demands careful risk mitigation.

EAG Bio Energy exemplifies value creation through strategic acquisitions and converting biogas electricity plants into higher value biomethane facilities, benefiting from attractive market prices. Ancillary revenues from heat, digestate and CO₂ represent additional growth opportunities.

Looking ahead, Mohajerani said he expects accelerated consolidation and industrialisation of the biogas industry, alongside increased corporate partnerships. He highlighted the need for long-term policy certainty and streamlined permitting processes to attract the estimated $80-100 billion capital investment necessary to meet Europe’s ambitious 2030 targets.

Miika Johansson, CEO of St1Biokraft, shared insights into the company’s ambitious growth and operational strategy in the bio-based energy sector. St1Biokraft is currently navigating a challenging supply-demand balance, selling over twice its own production volume by sourcing biomass from various suppliers, including local creek feedstocks. This dynamic evidences the importance of robust supply chain management and quality control across multiple production sites.

Johansson explained the company’s infrastructure expansion plans, with 11 new biorefinery stations opening this year and a target to establish a wide network across Sweden and Norway by 2028. These developments will significantly boost production capacity and support sustainability goals.

St1Biokraft’s dedicated R&D function focuses on maximising asset uptime and optimising substrate efficiency, ensuring the company extracts the highest value from its bio-based inputs. Additionally, the company’s strong in-house engineering team manages EPC contracts and applies industry best practices to its growing portfolio of operational facilities.

Johansson also addressed current market challenges, notably the tight contractor market with high demand and limited availability, which underscores the company’s risk management strategy of diversifying supplier partnerships.

A key investment milestone is the imminent launch of a biogas production facility in Balar, Sweden, specialising in manure processing. This project, partly owned by local farmers, reflects St1Biokraft’s commitment to community collaboration and sustainable bioenergy production.

Since its establishment in late 2024, St1Biokraft is positioned for rapid growth and actively seeks collaboration opportunities to achieve its ambitious production and sales targets in the evolving bioenergy market.

Prodeval’s pivotal role

Jean-René Pouzin, international business manager at Prodeval, delivered an engaging presentation on the company’s pivotal role in advancing biogas upgrading and biomethane injection technologies, with a strong focus on the French market.

Prodeval, a French-headquartered firm with over 400 employees worldwide, specialises in converting biogas into biomethane through innovative membrane and PSA technologies. Its equipment currently supports around 80% of France’s biomethane grid injection, with more than 600 units installed across Europe and growing international presence.

Jean-René detailed the rapid expansion of the biomethane sector over the last decade, highlighting Prodeval’s leadership in developing flexible, modular solutions to meet the diverse needs of the market.

The company’s modular approach allows for scalable, efficient plant designs that can be quickly adapted and deployed, with typical installation times reduced to around 20 weeks.

Global biogas market

Johanna Diederichs, sales trader and consultant at Green Steps, delivered a detailed presentation on the global biogas market, focusing on production, demand drivers and policy impacts across key regions.

Diederichs highlighted that Europe leads global biogas production, accounting for about 50%, with significant contributions also coming from the US, China and Brazil. Currently, approximately 45% of biogas is used in the transport sector, which is the main driver of demand worldwide.

In the US, half of biogas is upgraded to biomethane, mainly sourced from landfill gas. Early introduction of certification schemes and supportive legislation helped establish a strong market. California is aiming for full electrification of the transport sector by 2035, reserving biomethane for heavy industry applications.

China’s biogas market differs markedly, with a historically high share of raw biogas from household digesters, now shifting toward industrial production with ambitious expansion goals.

Brazil, leveraging its large ethanol industry, is expanding biomethane production by using ethanol by-products, supported by recent blending mandates.

India, although a smaller player now, shows huge potential due to its pollution challenges and policy incentives targeting a sevenfold production increase by 2035.

Europe is experiencing rapid growth in biomethane, doubling production from 6 to 12 BCM between 2023 and 2024. Diederichs emphasised that new European plants are increasingly residue- and waste-based rather than reliant on energy crops, reflecting environmental priorities.

Complex policy frameworks combining supply-side incentives and demand-side obligations are driving this growth, with EU-wide regulations like the Renewable Energy Directive and EU ETS playing major roles.

Diederichs also noted recent regulatory shifts, such as Germany’s plan to end double counting of waste-based biomethane, which immediately affected market dynamics. She stressed the importance of active policy engagement to sustain industry growth.

The presentation concluded with an outlook on the vital role of biomethane in decarbonisation and the strong influence of evolving policies worldwide.

The maritime market

Tatiana Shakhova, originator biomethane and BioLNG at Varo Energy, spoke about biomethane supply pathways and their significance for the maritime fuel market. With extensive experience in biomethane trading and storage, Shakhova highlighted Varo Energy’s strong presence in downstream distribution across Europe, including terminals in the Benelux, Germany, France and Switzerland.

Shakhova outlined three primary biomethane production pathways: on-site physical liquefaction, grid injection followed by terminal liquefaction and the innovative virtual terminal liquefaction.

The first two methods face constraints in storage capacity and scale, limiting economic viability. Virtual liquefaction, however, offers greater scale and flexibility by reversing gas flows from the grid back into LNG terminals, leveraging existing infrastructure for maritime biofuel supply.

Varo Energy’s biomethane production plant currently generates 400 GWh annually, with expansion plans targeting 650 GWh. Shakhova outlined the growing maritime demand driven by stringent emissions regulations and the economic competitiveness of biomethane relative to alternatives such as hydrogen or ammonia.

Biomethane reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 60% compared to conventional LNG and aligns well with upcoming FuelEU Maritime regulations.

Despite rapid market growth, supply limitations persist. Shakhova pointed out that European biomethane liquefaction capacity is insufficient to meet future maritime demand fully, highlighting the necessity for additional terminal capacity. She concluded that biomethane is a promising, scalable decarbonisation fuel for shipping, with diverse production and supply pathways tailored to different market needs and operational challenges.

Attracting funding in the biogas sector

Christian Cuenot, independent consultant at Blue Biogas, examined how to secure funding for biogas projects amid a challenging market environment. Drawing on his extensive expertise, Cuenot outlined practical strategies and key considerations for developers aiming to attract investment in 2024 and beyond.

Cuenot emphasised the importance of a well-structured approach involving six critical steps: developing a robust business case, understanding investor profiles, ensuring technical feasibility, navigating permitting processes, building strong partnerships and delivering compelling pitches. He stressed that demonstrating clear project profitability and transparently managing risks are essential to meet investor expectations.

He noted that, although the biogas sector faces pressures such as market volatility and regulatory shifts, it remains a compelling opportunity due to its competitive costs and significant carbon reduction potential. Cuenot highlighted support from organisations like the International Energy Agency, which underscores the sector’s long-term growth prospects despite short-term challenges.

The presentation categorised investors into impact investors seeking higher-risk, higher-return projects; development banks focused on strategic sustainability goals; and private equity or infrastructure funds preferring stable, lower-risk investments. Understanding these distinct investor motivations helps tailor project proposals effectively.

Cuenot also discussed common risks at various project stages, including feasibility, public acceptance, construction and operation, advising developers to engage stakeholders proactively and secure stable revenue streams through mechanisms like subsidies and long-term contracts.

Concluding, Cuenot urged biogas developers to adopt comprehensive risk management and strategic planning to enhance project attractiveness and successfully secure funding in a competitive landscape.",https://www.bioenergy-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/JR_Biofuels-39-768x512.jpg,N,,2025-07-22 13:07:45.219443
,,2025-07-22 14:31:36+00:00,Los Angeles Times,Airlines face climate reality check with green jet fuel - Los Angeles Times,Ben Elgin,,,,,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-07-22/airlines-face-climate-reality-check-with-green-jet-fuel,"The company acquired 55 million gallons of cleaner jet fuel, which is derived from lower-emitting sources such as used cooking oil and animal tallow.
Globally, sustainable aviation fuel is expected to increase to 0.7% from 0.3% of aviation fuel this year.
Starting this year, the European Union and the U.K. require jet fuel to include at least 2% SAF.
(When including cargo carriers, DHL Group led the world by using SAF for 3.52% of its jet fuel last year.)
This could include levies on frequent fliers or carbon taxes on jet fuel.","British Airways’ parent company, International Airlines Group, surged ahead of other passenger airlines last year to consume the most sustainable aviation fuel, according to a Bloomberg Green review of corporate filings from dozens of air carriers.

The company acquired 55 million gallons of cleaner jet fuel, which is derived from lower-emitting sources such as used cooking oil and animal tallow. That number exceeded the amount used by all U.S. passenger airlines combined.

But the promising performance is overshadowed by a troubling reality for the industry: The shift to sustainable aviation fuel is still minuscule, while growth in passenger air travel is drowning out any climate gains so far. For example, despite IAG’s world-leading status, cleaner fuel accounted for only about 1.9% of its overall fuel consumption last year, and its emissions from fuel combustion still rose by 5%.

Globally, sustainable aviation fuel is expected to increase to 0.7% from 0.3% of aviation fuel this year. But the International Air Transport Assn. expects air travel to climb 6%, causing another jump in emissions.

“We’re still at the very beginning of this market,” said Daisy Robinson, a BloombergNEF analyst who focuses on renewable fuels. “It’s going to take some time.”

New rules are springing up in different parts of the world to spur more use of sustainable aviation fuel, which costs at least twice as much as conventional jet fuel. Starting this year, the European Union and the U.K. require jet fuel to include at least 2% SAF. Other requirements have been enacted or planned in Canada’s British Columbia province, Brazil, Indonesia and Singapore.

Such rules help protect first movers from being undercut on prices by competitors. “As airlines, because of competition, we’re not great at doing this voluntarily,” said Aaron Robinson, IAG’s vice president for sustainable aviation fuels in the U.S. “Mandates in different geographies can play a really important role in moving the whole aviation industry forward.”

In the U.S., where no mandates are planned and where President Trump’s recent tax bill reduced incentives for SAF, airlines have fallen behind the market leaders — despite some heavily advertising their pursuit of greener fuels.

Alaska Air Group Inc. leaped to the front of U.S. carriers last year by increasing its SAF usage more than tenfold to 0.68% of its fuel. That’s about double the percentage of several other big U.S. airlines, including JetBlue Airways Corp., United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. It’s nearly 10 times the percentage of American Airlines Group Inc., which used only 0.07% SAF. (When including cargo carriers, DHL Group led the world by using SAF for 3.52% of its jet fuel last year.)

Businesses that spend a lot on corporate travel, such as tech firms and consulting companies, helped pay for more than half of Alaska’s SAF last year. This enables companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Autodesk Inc. to claim a smaller carbon footprint. Microsoft shaved its emissions by 65,000 tons last year by helping cover the cost of greener fuels, including for some employee flights on Alaska.

It’s unclear, though, how many more companies will step up, especially given the high cost of cleaner jet fuel compared with other options to rein in emissions. Ryan Spies, managing director of sustainability for Alaska, estimates that businesses pay $150 to $300 for each ton of carbon dioxide that they avoid through SAF purchases. By comparison, carbon offsets sold for an average of about $6.30 per ton last year, according to Ecosystem Marketplace — though many offset projects have delivered fewer climate benefits than advertised.

“This pool might not be that deep,” Spies said. “The only way to bring these [cost] numbers down is to invest in these technologies.”

Global SAF production continues to lurch forward at an uneven clip. Although analysts say there’s plenty of green fuel to hit the 2% mandates in Europe this year, vastly more will be needed for airlines to reach their widely held goals of 10% SAF by 2030.

A couple of new plants began churning out cleaner fuels last year, including a large Texas facility from Diamond Green Diesel, which is a joint venture between Valero Energy Corp. and Darling Ingredients Inc. Meanwhile, World Energy’s first-in-the-country SAF plant in Paramount, has been shut down for months after the loss of financial backing from Air Products & Chemicals Inc. A World Energy spokesperson said there’s no timetable for restarting the plant.

Perhaps the biggest disappointment for airlines has been the retreat of oil giants, which previously trumpeted massive commitments in this area. BP, for instance, said two years ago that it was pursuing five projects around the world that would produce 50,000 barrels of renewable fuels per day, with a focus on SAF. The oil major has since scaled back most of these plans amid a renewed focus on fossil fuels. BP didn’t respond to requests for comment.

“We need to make sure that some of these bigger players are really investing in the new facilities,” said Hemant Mistry, director of net zero transition for the International Air Transport Assn. “They’re the ones who have the technical expertise, the experience, and they have the balance sheets, as well.”

Passenger air travel is expected to double by 2050, which will probably cause emissions to soar. While airlines are counting heavily on cleaner fuels to save the day — IATA anticipates SAF could be 80% to 90% of the fuel supply by mid-century — others are more pessimistic. BloombergNEF, for instance, predicts that scarce feedstocks and a lack of new plants will limit these cleaner fuels to about 7% of the industry’s propellant by 2050.

Considering these challenges, some in the industry are pushing it to shift its focus beyond SAF and to address the thorny issue of ever-rising passenger numbers. “Limiting or even questioning growth, that is difficult for airlines,” said Karel Bockstael, a former vice president of sustainability at KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, who retired in 2022 after 32 years at the company.

Bockstael last year co-founded the group Call Aviation to Action, which has the support of more than 400 current and former aviation insiders, including from fuel producers, airports and airlines. They’re urging the industry to set firm limits for its emissions and to support more aggressive policies to stay within these boundaries. This could include levies on frequent fliers or carbon taxes on jet fuel.

“We’re not against the industry, we love it, we know all the benefits of it,” Bockstael said. “But if we do not have a strategy — if we do not have a way out when planetary boundaries are forced upon us — then we will have serious problems, and our industry will have a tragic hard landing.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fc9f92e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x1890+0+256/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb2%2F24%2F02f51a5c4a7ea22e9e892e9afb71%2F1431789-la-me-lax-superbloom-1-brv.jpg,N,,2025-07-22 13:07:49.295597

Funding from Department for Transport to advance two commercial-scale plants in the UK

LONDON, July 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LanzaTech Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: LNZA) (“LanzaTech” or the “Company”) a leader in carbon management solutions, announced it has received a grant of £6.4 million from the UK government's Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF), operated by the Department for Transport (DfT).

The grant will accelerate the development of LanzaTech’s innovative DRAGON 1 & 2 projects, each playing a crucial role in the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the UK. Project DRAGON stands for Decarbonizing and Reimagining Aviation for the Goal Of Netzero.

The DRAGON 1 project is LanzaTech’s existing UK SAF project that will convert recycled carbon fuel ethanol (including ethanol from LanzaTech’s gas fermentation process) into Advanced SAF in Port Talbot, South Wales, using the LanzaJet® Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) process.

The DRAGON 2 project is a Power-to-Liquid (PtL) facility that will convert waste carbon dioxide and green hydrogen into ethanol for subsequent conversion into PtL SAF at an adjacent facility using the LanzaJet® Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) process. The location for DRAGON 2 in the UK will be determined during this grant-funded project.

Integrating LanzaTech’s gas fermentation process with LanzaJet’s AtJ technology gives this approach a distinctive edge. By turning regional waste resources into valuable SAF, LanzaTech facilitates the production of low Carbon Intensity (CI) fuels, contributing positively to the UK’s SAF Mandate and supporting economic growth and job creation in industrial zones in the UK.

""The future of aviation fuel is ethanol-to-SAF and LanzaTech is at the forefront,” said Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech. “Our commitment to enabling cleaner jet fuel is bolstered by the UK government’s continued support and confidence in LanzaTech as a leader in the sector. This funding not only affirms the value of our unique technology and feedstock approach but also propels our mission to integrate air travel into a circular carbon economy. DRAGON 1 & 2 are set to drive the global SAF market forward and exemplify the UK's commitment to leading SAF innovation on the global stage.”

The UK government's significant investment in these projects underscores their confidence in LanzaTech's proven, commercial-scale technology and its potential to substantially boost the UK's SAF production. This endorsement not only solidifies LanzaTech's reputation as a leader in advancing global clean energy initiatives but also emphasizes the crucial role of feedstock providers. By leveraging low-cost, sustainable inputs for SAF production, LanzaTech is poised to play a key role in aiding the aviation sector's pursuit of its net-zero commitments.

Separately, Project Speedbird by LanzaJet, in which LanzaTech holds a 36% ownership stake, also received recognition and £10 million in funding from the Advanced Fuels Fund, further testament to the government's trust in the Lanza technology portfolio. In 2024, LanzaTech and LanzaJet partnered to create CirculAir™, that transforms nearly any form of waste carbon (including CO2, MSW, agri residues) into SAF, combining the groundbreaking technologies of both companies to provide the aviation industry with a solution to produce waste-based SAF on a global scale.

Today's allocation boosts total government contributions through the Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF) to £198 million, aimed at expanding cleaner aviation technologies. This strategic investment is a testament to the UK government’s comprehensive approach to environmental strategies, aligning with initiatives like the recently enacted SAF Mandate. This funding round notably supports a broad spectrum of pathways and feedstocks for SAF production—an inclusive move by the UK government that recognizes the need for varied solutions in the pursuit of net-zero aviation.

LanzaTech is committed to continuing its collaborative efforts with the UK government, industry partners, and the global community to scale solutions that can transform waste carbon into an opportunity for sustainable growth. We are proud to be recognized as part of the diverse array of solutions required to achieve a sustainable future for aviation.

Gevo Inc. is pleased to announce that it is selling carbon abatement into the market for the first time. To support decarbonization and to mitigate its corporate travel emissions, the buyer, a global financial and technology company, purchased high-integrity durable carbon removal credits, known as CORCs (or CO2 Removal Certificates), that are Puro.earth-certified and are ready to retire immediately. CORCs provide true carbon abatement, with a volume of actual carbon dioxide permanently removed from circulation, which offsets the effect of emissions.

Selling high-integrity CORCs is core to Gevo’s strategy, with the rapidly expanding demand for high-quality carbon credits presenting a real market opportunity today.

The Gevo North Dakota facility has the appropriate geological formation and operational Class VI well for CCS, with a total estimated sequestration capacity of up to 1 million metric tons of CO2 per year. This site can supply customers with CORCs today that are ready to be retired immediately. The supply of credits is certified by Puro.earth under its strict standards for 1,000-plus-years permanence and other key quality parameters required by customers. CCS is a key part of our decarbonization strategy for sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”) as we develop production on multiple pathways.

CO2 is a product that is often used in industrial applications, including the food and beverage industry or the petroleum production industry through enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Alternatively, CO2 can have value by being captured and permanently stored, in lieu of being emitted to the atmosphere. At Gevo North Dakota, biogenic CO₂ is captured and securely stored underground—enabling the generation of the CORCs.

“These are real sales of credits for carbon dioxide removal that are being generated right now,” says Alex Clayton, chief business development officer for Gevo. “Customers should feel confident in the CORCs we provide due to the rigor Gevo and Puro.earth are putting into every step of the process. We previously said that after our purchase of Gevo North Dakota that we would be selling carbon and that’s what we’re doing.”

“Gevo is demonstrating that durable carbon removal isn’t some distant solution—it’s available now,” said Trenton Spindler, chief growth officer at Puro.earth. “With Puro-certified CORCs, buyers worldwide can act decisively to tackle their toughest emissions with confidence in real, permanent results.”

The project will be delivered by a consortium, including Fuel Cell Energy (US), Green Lizard Technologies (UK), Drax Power (UK), IMI Vivo (Italy), Gardner Consulting (UK), and Leeds Bradford Airport (UK), and received letters of support from Airbus, Boeing, City of Doncaster Council and Qatar Airways.

SAF is typically produced using bio or waste feedstock. However, there are concerns over whether a sufficient level of feedstock is possible to establish and maintain. The University of Sheffield’s new production pathway eliminates this reliance as it can produce SAF using a combination of renewable energy sources and next generation carbon capture technology.

The pathway is called Power to Liquid (PtL). It uses renewable electricity to produce hydrogen and captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or industrial processes. The hydrogen and CO2 are then combined to create synthetic hydrocarbons, which can be refined into SAF.

This pathway could enable cost-competitive SAF production, offering operational flexibility while also decarbonising industrial appliances.

The Sheffield-led project, called NextGen-SAF, aims to build a world first demonstration plant combining two innovative technologies to produce SAF - a Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) and an Advance Fischer-Tropsch (AFT) reactor. The fuel cell can generate hydrogen and capture CO2 and the reactor converts the mixture into the synthetic hydrocarbons that are then refined into SAF. The plant will demonstrate the operability, reliability and performance of the integrated system so the method can be scaled up.

Professor Koen Lamberts, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sheffield, said: “We are proud to lead this project, made possible by this vital funding, to develop a new and innovative SAF production pathway. Sustainable Aviation Fuel is essential to reducing emissions from the aviation industry and through this project we are taking a major step toward scaling up SAF production right here in the UK. This initiative not only advances the UK’s goals around SAF but also strengthens the nation’s fuel production capabilities and will deliver lasting economic benefits.”

Announcing £63 million of funding for 17 projects to accelerate SAF production, Aviation Minister Mike Kane said: ""This £63 million is lift-off for Britain's green aviation revolution. We're not just backing brilliant British innovation, we're creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market.

""From the labs of Sheffield to the runways of the future – this is how we kickstart economic growth, secure energy independence, and make Britain a clean energy superpower.""

The University of Sheffield is one of the world’s leading universities for sustainable aviation fuel R&D. Its Energy Innovation Centre is home to some of the most advanced clean energy research facilities in Europe, which include pilot scale testing facilities that enable academics and businesses to collaborate to test new clean energy technologies, including sustainable aviation fuel, before scaling up and commercialising.

The University hosts the UK SAF Clearing House - one of only two centres in the world - that support fuel producers in obtaining the certification needed for use in the aviation industry.

Sheffield was part of a consortium that delivered the world’s first transatlantic flight powered by sustainable aviation fuel. Researchers from the University analysed the impact of SAF on the flight’s particulate emissions and contrail formation using the unique SAF research facilities at the Energy Innovation Centre. The results demonstrated up to a 70 per cent reduction in emission levels.",https://sheffield.ac.uk/sites/default/files/styles/two_thirds_2x/public/2024-04/GettyImages-1414599949.jpg?h=34c9d013&itok=5EXxCYpa,N,,2025-07-22 09:20:11.324153

Event travel and reliance on single-use plastics, such as water bottles and snack packaging, compound these challenges. The emissions from fans and artists traveling to each venue contribute significantly to the carbon footprint.

Coldplay is actively working to counteract this impact during its most current tour, with a focus on raising fans' environmental awareness and reducing its own emissions significantly.

Innovative approaches to emission reduction

In its commitment to reducing environmental impact, Coldplay has decreased its carbon emissions by more than 50% through implementing more sustainable practices such as energy reduction and extensive recycling initiatives. The band aims to offset more CO₂ than produced by the tour through funding projects focused on environmental rehabilitation and innovation. These initiatives include:

Reforestation

Rewilding

Conservation

Soil regeneration

Carbon capture and storage

Furthermore, Coldplay seeks guidance from the Oxford Principles for net zero aligned carbon offsetting to address unavoidable emissions. Partnering with notable firms like DHL, a leader in sustainable logistics solutions, enhances their efforts to lower emissions from transportation and other logistics-related environmental impacts.

Renewable energy at concerts

Partnering with BMW, Coldplay developed the first rechargeable show battery, leveraging recycled BMW i3 batteries to power concerts entirely with renewable energy.

The setup includes solar photovoltaic panels installed backstage to charge the batteries prior to each show. The tour also features innovative energy sources, such as kinetic floors installed around stadiums, where energy from fans' movements contributes to powering the performance.

The band relies on renewable diesel made from hydrotreated vegetable oil, further reducing the tour's carbon footprint. Each aspect of the concert is carefully designed with sustainability in mind, incorporating stages built from lightweight, low-carbon, and reusable materials, such as recycled steel. LED wristbands distributed to audiences are compostable and reused to minimize production waste.

DHL's contribution to emissions management

DHL has played a crucial role in reducing Coldplay's tour emissions by deploying a carbon intelligence and monitoring system. This system provides an in-depth analysis of the tour's carbon footprint, allowing for targeted optimization operations. Findings revealed that a significant portion (over 80%) of CO₂ emissions stemmed from air transport of equipment.

To address this, DHL developed the GoGreen Plus initiative. This program utilises carbon insetting, enabling customers to reduce emissions directly at the source. For instance, enabling air freight carriers for the tour to purchase Sustainable Aviation Fuel, which provides an 85% reduction in the fuel life-cycle per flight.

Coldplay released a statement saying: “We’re happy to report that direct CO₂ emissions from the first two years of this tour are 59% less than our previous stadium tour (2016-17), on a show-by-show comparison. These figures have been verified by the MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative.

“We’d like to say a huge thank you to our incredible touring family and to all the brilliant people who’ve made this possible.

“Most of all, we’d like to thank everyone who’s come to a show and helped charge the show batteries on the power bikes and kinetic dance floors; everyone who’s arrived by foot, bike, ride share or public transport; everyone who’s come with refillable water bottles or returned their LED wristband for recycling; and everyone who’s bought a ticket, which means you’ve planted one of 7 million trees so far.

“As a band, and as an industry, we’re a long way from where we need to be on this. But we’re grateful for everyone’s help so far, and we salute everyone who’s making efforts to push things in the right direction.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/7b11db6b3b46080208ce3cc36544ea4d:3278373b211bc8560586385c0e4b4912/coldplay-main.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-22 09:20:45.276099

It means the UK Government has now invested £198m to-date the Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF) to scale up cleaner aviation technologies.

The AFF winners include a range of companies and are spread across the country, such as OXCCU Tech who are developing a demonstration plant at Oxford Airport, to LanzaJet who are building a commercial-scale plant in south Wales.

Low carbon fuel production could add up to £5 billion to the economy by 2050. SAF is an alternative to fossil jet fuel which reduces greenhouse gas emissions on average by 70% on a lifecycle basis, from feedstock to biofuel.

The SAF Bill will help secure the future of the aviation sector, by boosting green fuel production in the UK and delivering cleaner flights. The bill also aims to give investors the confidence to back sustainable aviation fuel production, grow the sector, providing good green jobs, and enabling the delivery of carbon savings.

Professor Mohamed Pourkashanian, Managing Director of the University of Sheffield’s Energy Innovation Centre, who is leading the project, said:

“It is fantastic to see the University of Sheffield playing a leading role in the development of sustainable aviation fuel and supporting the aviation industry in its efforts to reduce its emissions.

“At Sheffield we have some of the most advanced SAF research facilities in Europe and are excited to work with partners from the industry to help them test and develop new fuels and next generation clean energy technologies.”

Andrew Symes, CEO and Co-Founder of OXCCU, said:

“Support from the Advanced Fuels Fund is a key step in scaling our technology. This funding enables the detailed design and construction of OX2, our demonstration plant launching in 2026, and builds on the successful delivery of OX1. It brings us closer to producing lower-cost, lower-carbon aviation fuel and supports the UK’s ambition to become a global leader in SAF production.”

Jimmy Samartzis, Chief Executive Officer, LanzaJet, said:

“We’re proud that Project Speedbird, developed in partnership with British Airways, has been recognised by the Department for Transport as part of its continued commitment to advancing SAF in the UK.

“This support demonstrates confidence in LanzaJet’s technology and the critical role ethanol-to-SAF can play in delivering economic growth, creating jobs, and decarbonising air travel. Project Speedbird is vital to building a national SAF industry in the UK and to unlocking opportunity and innovation in the region. We thank the DfT for its leadership and vision in accelerating the transition to net-zero aviation.”

The investigation into Chinese exports of biodiesel was spurred by allegations made by German authorities in 2023. In response, the Commission undertook an assessment of the situation, as required by Renewable Energy Directive regulations. That assessment was completed in close cooperation with German authorities. The information gathered as part of the assessment did not confirm the existence of fraud, but the Commission noted the German authorities may perform additional verification or investigations if they wish to do so.

While the Commission did not confirm fraud, the investigation did identify some systematic weaknesses in the way certification audits have been conducted. As a result, the Commission said it will take several actions to address those weaknesses.

As part of that effort, the Commission has established a working group to consider updates to regulatory language that could better prevent fraud in the future. Those amendments could be finalized as soon as 2026.

The Commission also said it is in discussions with European Union countries on a timeline for the full mandatory deployment of the Union database for biofuels. This EU global traceability system is functional and is being used by an increasing number of operators but its mandatory systemic use by all relevant businesses is a pre-condition for its success.

While innovations like hydrogen-powered flights and fully electric aircraft are still on the horizon, there’s a growing call for immediate solutions.This year at Air Cargo Europe, Airbus introduced its A350 freighter, which they claim can substantially lower the industry’s carbon output when combined wiht a broader adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“The A350 freighter achieves a 40% reduction in fuel consumption per tonne compared to older models such as the 747-400,” explained Thomas Burger, who oversees environmental marketing at Airbus. “This is crucial for our goal of making aviation more sustainable, notably in cargo transport.”

The A350F marks Airbus’s first entry into next-generation freighters and plays an essential role in their short-term decarbonization strategy. Burger acknowledges that while revolutionary propulsion technologies are on their way, they aren’t available just yet. For now, updating older aircraft remains the most effective method to cut emissions.

“Replacing outdated planes with new ones is vital for immediate decarbonization,” he noted.”The A350 freighter provides operators with an instant possibility to reduce CO₂ emissions compared to what they’re currently flying.”

In addition to this immediate focus, Airbus is also investing in future technologies. “We’re exploring various innovative solutions,” said Burger. “As a notable example,we’re enhancing wing designs for better aerodynamics.” New engine technology developments are also underway.

“By the end of this decade, we plan to have an open rotor demonstrator flying,” he added enthusiastically. “Our aim is to refine these technologies so that they can be implemented effectively down the line.”

Sustainable aviation Fuel challenges

However, technology alone won’t solve everything; SAF remains one of the most practical options available right now for cutting emissions from existing fleets.While Burger emphasized how using drop-in SAF could make a difference quickly, he also pointed out supply challenges.

Apart from its own operations influencing industry standards and practices regarding SAF production and usage rates—Burger mentioned that understanding these challenges allows them to collaborate effectively with airlines and regulatory bodies: “We want production levels of SAF aligned with industry needs as we strive toward net-zero goals by 2050.”

The BelugaXL fleet serves as both operational support and testing ground for blending fuels—a move that positions Airbus as what Burger calls a “catalyst” within this transition:

“We see ourselves facilitating higher quantities of SAF usage across our operations.”

Circular Economy Considerations

While operational activities contribute significantly—around 95%—to overall aircraft emissions during their lifecycle according to Burger’s insights; there’s also an increasing emphasis on sustainability throughout each phase including end-of-life processes.

“We’re heavily invested in recycling initiatives,” he remarked proudly about their joint venture Tarmac which operates facilities across Spain, France and China capable of recycling over 90% weight from decommissioned aircraft.

This capability strengthens arguments favoring newer models’ long-term sustainability especially considering future market dynamics where environmental performance may directly impact asset values or leasing conditions.

Taking Action Now

The takeaway from Airbus? Immediate action hinges upon replacing old fleets alongside integrating more sustainable fuels—not waiting around for groundbreaking innovations.

“Combining advancements like SAF adoption within current fleets contributes significantly towards achieving over 80 percent reduction targets set forth by industry stakeholders today—and moving forward,” asserted Burger.

Yet realizing this vision relies not only upon manufacturers’ capabilities but equally upon regulators’, producers’, operators’ willingness—or ability—to embrace change amidst financial pressures coupled with supply limitations along technical hurdles ahead.",https://fullavantenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/92742-airbus-pushes-next-gen-freighter-as-route-to-net-zero.jpg,N,,2025-07-22 09:21:41.087054

The cash will be shared by 17 British companies developing different types of ""sustainable aviation fuel"" (SAF), made from materials including forest cuttings, household rubbish, sugar beet or hydrogen gas.

Ministers said the funds could support 1,400 jobs, add £5bn to the economy and help the British industry get ahead as global demand for SAF soars in order to meet stricter climate targets.

But campaigners question how sustainable these fuels really are, saying the real answer is to deter ""frequent flying"".

They warn the materials needed for sustainable fuels are hard to come by and too expensive to ever scale up.

Industry says it needs this cash injection precisely in order to lower costs and grow, and global demand is booming.

As of January, flights taking off from the UK must use 2% SAF in their fuel, under new government rules. This will gradually rise to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040.

But there have been alarm bells warning not enough SAF will be available to meet those targets.

The government says sustainable fuels cut emissions of greenhouse gases by 70% on average compared with kerosene over the course of its life, which includes producing it and burning it.

Aviation minister Mike Kane said: ""We're not just backing brilliant British innovation, we're creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market.""

He said the move would ""kickstart economic growth, secure energy independence, and make Britain a clean energy superpower"".

But campaigners say at best the fuels will reduce aviation emissions ""by a tiny fraction of the amount needed"", and are being used to justify ""irresponsible levels"" of airport expansion.

James Sutton, co-director of climate charity Possible, told Sky News they were not anti-investment, but that the SAF plans would not bring down emissions at the pace and scale necessary.

He said: ""We need to cut those emissions immediately if we have any hope of hitting our climate goals, not just sit and hope for the best in a few decades time.

""The technology and investment required for SAF to displace kerosene entirely is simply not there yet, but policies aimed at reducing demand for flights and taxing frequent flyers, which will therefore cut emissions, are possible now.

""So that is what we need to focus on first and foremost.""

Viva Energy Australia is delivering Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Blended Jet Fuel to power the Royal Australian Air Force’s KC-30A Multi-Role Tanker Transport — an advanced Airbus A330 reimagined for air-to-air refuelling and strategic airlift operations.

Director General Fuel Capability, Brigadier Mark Baldock, said Talisman Sabre provides a valuable opportunity to trial new fuel technologies in a realistic operational setting.

“This is about improving energy security. Proving the viability of alternate fuels enhances fuel resilience by diversifying our supply chains,” Brigadier Baldock said.

“There is also the important benefit of reducing emissions.

“We are building upon our current fuel system to ensure that it is fit for the future. We are doing it in lockstep with our industry partners, our international allies, and our own people on the ground and in the air.”

The partnership with Viva Energy signals an important step forward in the Australian Defence Force’s journey toward energy resilience and what it intends as a reduced carbon footprint.

Richard Xin, Viva Energy General Manager – Specialties, Marine & Defence said Viva Energy would supply both conventional and renewable fuels for the Talisman Sabre 2025 exercise as the Commonwealth’s strategic fuel partner.

“By supplying both conventional and renewable fuels for Talisman Sabre 2025, we’re helping to unlock a different type of capability for Defence and facilitating solutions which shore up energy security whilst supporting the energy transition,” he said.

“Together with the ADF and our international partners, we’re very proud to take this important step with sustainability during such a large and significant exercise.”

As Exercise Talisman Sabre 2025 (TS25) ramps up across Australia, the skies above Queensland have marked a new milestone in Defence’s commitment to cleaner energy with the use of SAF.

Australian and UK partners trialled the fuel technology on a special VIP flight.

SAF is a certified ‘drop-in’ fuel used in both military and civilian aviation around the world. It is made from renewable feedstocks like used cooking oil, waste fats, and plant oils.

When blended with fossil-derived fuel in accordance with international standards, It requires no modifications to aircraft or fuel infrastructure and has the potential to reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to fossil-derived fuel.

The SAF used on this mission, fuelled a 33 Squadron MRTT aircraft at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, ahead of a TS25 mission.

“Exercises like Talisman Sabre give us a perfect opportunity to work with industry and international partners to trial next-generational fuels in ways that support capability and climate resilience,” said Brigadier Baldock.

“We are building upon our current fuel system to ensure that it is fit for the future. We are doing it in lockstep with our industry partners, our international allies, and our own people on the ground and in the air.”

Flight Lieutenant Michael Que Hee, a pilot at 33 Squadron flying the mission, said that from a user perspective the switch to SAF was seamless.

“From the cockpit, there’s no difference, the aircraft flies exactly the same,” Flight Lieutenant Que Hee said.

“Knowing we are helping to enhance the fuel supply chain and reducing emissions just by doing our job makes it even more rewarding.”

Aircraft technician Leading Aircraftman Tikiri Lamb involved in the VIP flight preparation, echoed the same sentiment from the tarmac.

“With the same equipment and process, it’s just like refuelling with standard aviation fuel,” Leading Aircraftman Lamb said.

“It’s great knowing we are contributing to something bigger, while still doing our job the same way we always do.”

Defence’s use of SAF reflects key objectives outlined in the 2024 National Defence Strategy, the Defence Net Zero Strategy, and the Defence Future Energy Strategy, driving greater energy independence, climate responsibility, and fuel security.

Vivergo’s parent company Associated British Foods (ABF) opened a 45-day redundancy consultation period for its 160 staff members 20 days ago, following repeated warnings from the company that UK bioethanol manufacturing will become commercially unsustainable once the US-UK trade deal comes into force. The deal, agreed in May, will remove the existing 19% tariffs on US bioethanol imported into the UK up to a threshold of 1.4bn L – far more than the 820m L produced each year at the country’s two main plants, with Teesside-based Ensus also facing closure.

Vivergo has warned that without government intervention, British bioethanol producers will be unable to compete with cheap American imports which are heavily subsidised by the US government. The company suspended purchases of wheat feedstock, largely sourced from British farms, in early June, and currently plans to cease all production by 13 September if it does not receive commitment of government support by the end of the consultation period.

Industry unity

The statement, issued today following a gathering at the Saltend Chemicals Park in Hull last week, was signed by Vivergo managing director Ben Hackett along with seven other senior industry figures based at Saltend, including the site manager of Ineos’ acetic acid plant Rob Fergie. The statement stressed that bioethanol producers are not demanding an “infinite subsidy” but rather “targeted action” to help grow UK demand for bioethanol.

The primary use of bioethanol in the UK is as an additive in petrol to lower exhaust emissions, currently forming 10% of standard grade unleaded petrol, or “E10”. Hackett believes increasing this to 15% will both reduce emissions further and help rescue the bioethanol industry.

The statement warned that support was needed to “prevent a key pillar of the Humber’s green industrial future from collapsing”, adding that the closure of Vivergo would drive up costs for other Saltend businesses.

Vivergo also wants regulations of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to change, which could become a key market for bioethanol. Current regulations are that SAF must be made from non-food biomass such as agricultural waste, deeming jet fuel produced from bioethanol made from “first generation” crops such as wheat ineligible to be classed as SAF. Vivergo has already signed a memorandum of understanding with Saltend-based green hydrogen maker Meld Energy to produce SAF, but the joint statement, signed by Meld CEO Chris Smith, warned this is “dependent on Vivergo’s survival”.

Calls to make it easier for bioethanol producers to enter the SAF market were made in parliament last week during a subcommittee hearing on the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill. Sophia Haywood, director of UK and EU government affairs at SAF manufacturer LanzaJet, told the committee she believed “SAF is a great opportunity for the challenge that the bioethanol sector is currently facing.”

Maintaining Saltend’s integrated model

Today’s joint statement said: “We are asking for swift, targeted action that gives domestic bioethanol a fair chance to compete and keeps Saltend’s integrated model intact…The government has an opportunity to show that it backs the UK’s chemicals, future fuels and bioeconomy sectors. We stand ready to work with ministers to secure Vivergo’s future and unlock the full potential of the Saltend cluster for the region and for the country.”

Last month, the government began negotiating possible options to support the industry and has contracted external consultants to evaluate business plans submitted by Vivergo and Ensus.

A government spokesperson said: “We recognise this is a concerning time for workers and their families which is why we entered into negotiations with the company on potential financial support last month.

“We will continue to take proactive steps to address the long-standing challenges the company faces and remain committed to working closely with them throughout this period to present a plan for a way forward that protects supply chains, jobs and livelihoods.”",https://www.thechemicalengineer.com/media/22628/vivergo-fermentation.jpg?width=960,N,,2025-07-21 19:57:13.447975

More than a dozen rojects, including LanzaTech’s commercial-scale plant rollouts and the University of Sheffield’s demonstration plant for SAF production combined with carbon capture, will be supported by the latest funding allocation.

Aviation Minister Mike Kane said: “This £63m is lift off for Britain’s green aviation revolution. We’re not just backing brilliant British innovation, we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market.

“From the labs of Sheffield to the runways of the future – this is how we kickstart economic growth, secure energy independence, and make Britain a clean energy superpower.”

A total of 17 projects will share the £63m funding. SAF options supported include waste-derived fuels, green hydrogen, residue-derived fuels, and methanol-to-jet-fuel transformation.

The role of SAF

The Government is aiming to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from aviation by up to 6.3 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2040, with SAF expected to contribute significantly to this target. By 2030, the UK is expected to use 1.2 million tonnes of SAF annually, enough to fuel more than 3,000 global flights each year.

The SAF mandate is projected to add £1.8bn to the UK economy and create around 10,000 jobs. The 17 projects supported through the latest funding are projected to support around 1,400 jobs.

In May, the Government introduced a Revenue Certainty Mechanism (RCM) for producers to receive a fixed price for SAF. If the market price is lower, the Government will pay the difference. If it is higher, producers will return the extra profit.

Despite Government backing, SAFs continue to be debated. Demand is not yet ready to align with predicted supply, with many production projects faltering financially. And critics are increasingly questioning whether many current production methods actually deliver meaningful climate benefits across the fuel lifecycle.",https://edienetlive.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/full_42673.jpg,N,,2025-07-21 21:56:25.269128

SAF is an alternative to fossil jet fuel which reduces greenhouse gas emissions on average by 70% on a lifecycle basis, from feedstock to biofuel, making it the key technology that will allow UK aviation to grow capacity while achieving net zero commitments.

The SAF Bill will help secure the future of the aviation sector by boosting green fuel production in the UK and delivering cleaner flights. This bill will give investors the confidence to back sustainable aviation fuel production. It will help grow the sector, providing good green jobs and enabling the delivery of carbon savings.

Announcing the new funding at the University of Sheffield’s Energy Innovation Centre – which just received £1.5 million in this latest round – the Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, saw firsthand the groundbreaking work on aircraft engine testbeds and revolutionary aviation fuels.

Professor Mohamed Pourkashanian, Managing Director of the University of Sheffield’s Energy Innovation Centre, who is leading the project, said:

It is fantastic to see the University of Sheffield playing a leading role in the development of sustainable aviation fuel and supporting the aviation industry in its efforts to reduce its emissions. At Sheffield, we have some of the most advanced SAF research facilities in Europe and are excited to work with partners from the industry to help them test and develop new fuels and next generation clean energy technologies.

The AFF winners include a range of companies and are spread across the country, such as OXCCU Tech, which is developing a demonstration plant at Oxford Airport, to LanzaJet, which is building a commercial-scale plant in Teesside.

Andrew Symes, CEO and Co-Founder of OXCCU, said:

Support from the Advanced Fuels Fund is a key step in scaling our technology. This funding enables the detailed design and construction of OX2, our demonstration plant launching in 2026, and builds on the successful delivery of OX1. It brings us closer to producing lower-cost, lower-carbon aviation fuel and supports the UK’s ambition to become a global leader in SAF production.

Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet, said:

We’re proud that Project Speedbird, developed in partnership with British Airways, has been recognised by the Department for Transport as part of its continued commitment to advancing SAF in the UK.

This support demonstrates confidence in LanzaJet’s technology and the critical role ethanol-to-SAF can play in delivering economic growth, creating jobs and decarbonising air travel.

Neste will provide the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to DHL at Changi Airport (SIN) over the course of a year, beginning this month, according to a July 15 release from Neste.

Neste declined to comment on the fuel’s cost but told Cargo Facts it is “one of the largest SAF deals by volume in Asia in the air cargo sector and DHL’s first SAF purchase for international flights from Singapore Changi Airport.”

DHL did not respond to requests for comment.

Neste will produce the SAF at its Singapore refinery. The SAF will be eligible for the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which requires that airlines purchase and cancel eligible emissions units (EEU) to offset the increase in carbon emissions CORSIA covers. One EEU equates to one tonne of carbon emissions reduction.

Neste will deliver the SAF blended with conventional jet fuel directly into SIN’s fuel distribution facilities. The SAF will account for approximately 35% to 40% of the overall fuel blend composition. DHL Express will use the blend in its five Singapore Airlines-operated 777Fs, which depart the airport twelve times a week, according to the release.

Decarbonizing DHL’s ops

DHL Group has been purchasing SAF from Neste since 2020. DHL and Neste agreed in February to collaborate more closely to evaluate how Neste’s fuels can help DHL decarbonize its operations. Neste delivers SAF to DHL at the airports in San Francisco (SFO), Amsterdam (AMS) and East Midlands, U.K. (EMA).

DHL is aiming for its logistics segment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emission targets by 2050, according to a July 15 release from DHL. By 2030, DHL aims to increase its share of sustainable fuels across all transportation modes to more than 30% and to electrify two-thirds of its last-mile delivery vehicles.

Neste at SIN

Neste completed a 1.6 billion euro ($1.9 billion) expansion project at its Singapore refinery in May 2023, bringing the refinery’s production capacity to 2.6 million tonnes annually. Of those 2.6 million tonnes, 1 million tonnes can be SAF, Neste said in a May 2023 release.

In 2024, Singapore Airlines and low-cost airline Scoot were the first carriers operating out of SIN to receive SAF produced in Neste’s Singapore refinery, Neste told Cargo Facts. Emirates and Vietnam Airlines used Neste SAF at SIN last year.

Neste’s global SAF production capability is 1.5 million tonnes annually.

“Our renewable fuels refinery in Tuas, Singapore, is currently the world’s largest SAF production facility and provides the aviation industry in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond,” Neste told Cargo Facts.

This gives industry members “the opportunity to start or expand their use of SAF in the region, whether to comply with governmental policies encouraging or mandating SAF use or to voluntarily replace fossil fuel use with SAF to reach their own climate targets,” Neste said.

“There’s a compelling case to strengthen New Zealand’s long-term aviation fuel supply with SAF.
Dr. Camrass also emphasized the strategic importance of reducing New Zealand’s dependence on imported jet fuel.
Compared to traditional jet fuel, SAF can substantially cut greenhouse gas emissions over its full lifecycle.
Globally, over 190 countries, including New Zealand, have committed through the International Civil Aviation Organization to reducing the carbon intensity of aviation fuels by 5% by 2030.","A new study by Cyan Ventures, with support from Boeing, suggests that producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) within New Zealand to supply 30% of the country’s jet fuel demand by 2050 could generate NZD 1.3 billion in Gross Value Added (GVA) and create around 5,700 jobs. The move would also enhance New Zealand’s fuel security and support its climate goals.

“There’s a compelling case to strengthen New Zealand’s long-term aviation fuel supply with SAF. It’s a pathway to both economic growth and emissions reduction,” said Dr. Kimberly Camrass, Boeing’s acting Regional Sustainability Lead for Asia Pacific. “We have a real opportunity to act now, with a clear direction to move forward.”

The report highlights the importance of defining appropriate feedstocks and certification standards for SAF, integrating SAF into the Emissions Trading Scheme, and developing a policy framework that encourages investment. Establishing a strong signal of demand and commitment from leadership is also seen as essential to attract investment.

In addition to economic and environmental benefits, the study notes that embracing SAF could help protect an estimated NZD 4.1 billion in tourism revenue and NZD 200 million in trade revenue through 2050. As more countries move to decarbonize aviation, demand for SAF is expected to become standard for both businesses and travelers.

Dr. Camrass also emphasized the strategic importance of reducing New Zealand’s dependence on imported jet fuel. “A domestic SAF supply is not just about emissions—it’s about safeguarding New Zealand’s energy security. If we don’t act, aviation could account for up to 22% of the country’s gross emissions by mid-century,” she said.

SAF is made from renewable resources such as agricultural and forestry residues, used cooking oil, animal fats, and municipal solid waste. Compared to traditional jet fuel, SAF can substantially cut greenhouse gas emissions over its full lifecycle.

While currently more expensive than fossil-based alternatives, the study notes that introducing SAF at 5% of total aviation fuel use by 2030 would keep New Zealand in line with regional peers and cost passengers less than a cup of coffee on a one-way domestic flight, a cost that may be offset by attracting 1.2% more air travelers.

Globally, over 190 countries, including New Zealand, have committed through the International Civil Aviation Organization to reducing the carbon intensity of aviation fuels by 5% by 2030. About 45 nations, including all of New Zealand’s top ten trading partners, have either introduced or pledged to implement SAF policies.

The findings were presented at the Aviation Decarbonisation Policy Roundtable held in Wellington, part of Boeing’s broader initiative to support the aviation sector’s net-zero emissions target by 2050.

Despite the elimination of a handful of alternative energy tax incentives in the new federal budget, Iowa corn farmers will benefit from one that was extended.

Tax breaks and rebates encouraging investment in solar and wind power in Iowa were eliminated in the federal spending plan. However, the Trump administration extended an incentive enabling farmers in Iowa to produce more corn. The Hawkeye State is the nation's top corn producer, much of which is used to produce ethanol.

Chris Bliley, senior vice president of regulatory affairs for the biofuel trade organization Growth Energy, said grain-based fuels burn cleaner and are more environmentally friendly.

""The credit actually goes for production of lower carbon fuels that are used for transportation,"" Bliley explained. ""It includes on-road fuels as well as sustainable aviation fuel. And so, the lower in carbon, the higher the credit.""

The announcement, made in July 2025, comes on the heels of a major leadership shakeup — with longtime CEO Seifi Ghasemi stepping down and new CEO Eduardo Menezes taking the reins. Menezes is steering the company back toward familiar territory: its traditional, low-risk industrial gases business built on steady, long-term contracts.

A Strategic Shift Back to Its Roots

Under Ghasemi’s leadership, Air Products leaned heavily into green hydrogen and sustainable energy ventures — bold moves aimed at driving industrial decarbonization. But those bets didn’t quite pay off as expected. The financial strain from these ambitious efforts triggered a strategic reset. Now, with Menezes at the helm, the focus is clearly shifting back to what the company knows best: stable returns over headline-grabbing innovation.

What This Means for U.S. Hydrogen Momentum

The fallout from the decision will ripple through the hydrogen production landscape in the United States. Some industry insiders worry this could be a setback for national sustainable energy goals, particularly when it comes to cleaner fuels for heavy transport and aviation. Still, the broader sector doesn’t appear to be slowing down.

Plenty of other players are still charging ahead. Companies like Plug Power and Invenergy, along with decentralized innovators such as Independence Hydrogen, remain on track with their own projects, many of which are expected to go live by the end of 2025. That continued momentum suggests that while Air Products’ exit makes waves, it’s far from a deal-breaker for the U.S. green hydrogen push.

Cars are not yet able to fly, but the aircraft than can soar the skies are constantly being improved upon, with a more sustainable future in mind. While electric cars and motorcycles have been around for many years now, electric aeroplanes have yet to show success. The aviation industry has struggled with this concept, until one forward-looking German company’s dream was set in motion.

Aircraft can only run on jet-fuel, right?

Historically, aircraft have run on various kinds of jet fuel, as well as aviation gasoline. The former is usually derived from kerosene, and the latter contains various amounts of lead. Both are not ideal when looking at environmental impact, which leads to the important question of how to mitigate harmful emissions in the aviation industry.

There have been some breakthroughs in the sector, with research being done on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) like biofuels, with some successful implementation. The problem is that these fuels have very high requirements in order to operate properly, which may be difficult for aircraft to meet, and are a lot more expensive to produce.

This leaves the industry with very little uptake of SAFs, despite its pledge to have halved its carbon emissions from 2005 to 2050. While the future may seem dire for sustainable aircraft, another highly probably option has been put forward by German eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) aircraft manufacturer, Lilium.

What Lilium proposed for the future of aviation

Lilium Aerospace GmbH is a manufacturing company that has developed the innovative electrically powered air vehicle, Lilium Jet. This design seeks to decarbonise the aviation industry, operating with 30 electric motors in its wings and opening a whole new world of possibilities for aircraft. This isn’t the first electric aircraft proposal, but perhaps the most interesting one to date.

While the range of this aircraft is still small, this is only the start to electric aeroplanes. Flying a respectable distance of 110 miles, the Lilium Jet is still perfectly suitable for city commutes, which is where its target lies. The aim is to one day have these aircraft available as a commuting option to bypass traffic congestion with zero carbon emissions.

While the Lilium Jet is an incredible design in theory, the company has experiences massive challenges along the road that make production of the jet almost certainly off the table.

Lilium’s failure brings two insolvency cases

While hopes were sky-high to get this aircraft up and running, the German manufacturers have had to file for insolvency not once, but on two separate occasions. After the first instance of insolvency, there appeared to be a wide range of investment interest, with Lilium CEO Klaus Roew stating:

“We are very pleased to announce the signing of an investment agreement with a very experienced consortium of investors, which is a major breakthrough.”

Mobile Uplift Corporation was reportedly interested in acquiring the assets to the company and investing $200 million into the Lilium Jet operations.

However, this breakthrough was short-lived, as investment money was never seen, and Lilium spokesperson soon after made a statement that their operations have ceased for the moment.

“As the funding options to secure Lilium’s future have not materialized in time, Lilium Aerospace has filed for insolvency today”

The great aspirations for an electric powered aviation industry have been set aside for the moment, and an unfortunate 700 or more employees are now without jobs as a result. Although there are many alternative options for sustainable aviation, Lilium’s visionary aircraft is not fundable at this time. Until the industry can find a way to afford more sustainable methods of flying, it looks like gasoline will remain the leading fuel for aviation.

The extreme heat is creating not just discomfort, but also major travel delays, as planes are delayed, tourist attractions close early, and passengers face increased health risks.

Heatwaves are growing more common and intense as a result of climate change, making their influence on travel more difficult to ignore. From reduced visiting hours at world-famous destinations to delayed flights and even evacuation orders due to wildfires, current conditions are driving passengers, airlines, and tourism officials to react in real time. Many people wonder if peak summer travel is still worth the risk.

Travel Plans Heat Up Literally

From Athens to Rome, hundreds of tourists have had to reconsider their summer plans. Due to excessive temperatures, Italian authorities have issued red alerts in towns such as Florence, Palermo, and Bologna, urging residents and visitors to stay indoors during peak hours.

In Greece, officials have reduced the hours of operation for popular attractions such as the Acropolis, closing it during the noon heat to prevent heatstroke and weariness among visitors and employees. Meanwhile, Spain is sending emergency staff to important travel hubs, anticipating increased demand on public services and transportation.

Airlines and Airports Are Feeling the Heat

The heatwave is affecting airports throughout southern Europe. Wildfires sparked by high temperatures interrupted airport operations in Rhodes, forcing emergency evacuations and causing havoc for arriving and departing travellers.

Airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair have begun issuing advisories, advising passengers to check their flight status often and plan for unexpected cancellations or delays. Overheated runways and heat-exhausted ground crews have also resulted in postponed flights at airports such as Rome Fiumicino and Madrid-Barajas.

Reconsidering Summer Travel

With peak-season temperatures getting increasingly harsh, tourists are reconsidering the timing and location of their travels. As southern cities become more difficult to navigate safely throughout the summer months, an increasing number of visitors are choosing for spring and fall getaways.

This trend encourages airlines and travel agents to market off-season discounts as alternatives to packed, sweltering locations. Scandinavia, the UK coast, and Eastern Europe are witnessing an increase in reservations as travellers seek milder climates and more peaceful experiences.

As temperatures continue high, officials advise travellers to take the following precautions:

Avoid outdoor sightseeing between 12 and 5 p.m

Stay hydrated and bring refillable water bottles

Use high-SPF sunscreen and wear protective clothes

Check the airline changes and travel insurance coverage

(Reuters) -India's Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) has extended the deadline for submitting bids for its green hydrogen project in Assam by two weeks, according to a tender document, as uncertainty looms over the state's flagship clean energy policy.

NRL, owned by explorer Oil India, has extended the last bid submission date to August 6 from July 23 without citing a reason for the extension, per the document seen by Reuters.

Last week, Reuters reported that the northeastern state of Assam had paused its green hydrogen policy, surprising investors who were already grappling with reduced incentives for renewable energy projects.

The delay has prompted companies to reassess their investment plans worth billions of rupees in the region that has historically lagged behind in clean energy adoption, Reuters had reported, citing sources.

Last week, Harit Molecules Foundation (HMF), an industry body representing green hydrogen project developers in India, wrote to NRL seeking an extension to submit bids for NRL's 10,000-metric-tonnes-per annum green hydrogen generation project at the Assam refinery, per an email seen by Reuters.

The HMF sought the extension citing a lack of clarity on incentives applicable to the project and the complex nature of the project.

NRL and Harit Molecules Foundation did not respond to requests for comment.

NRL had announced the green hydrogen tender last year and it is among the top tenders floated in the country to boost clean energy adoption.

Green hydrogen, produced using renewable electricity, is seen as a key tool in decarbonising heavy industries and transport.

Assam in February announced several incentives to attract clean energy investments into the state, but in June, it sharply reduced transmission subsidies and increased bank guarantees without giving reasons.

Multiple industry and government sources had told Reuters that the state was coming out with a new green hydrogen policy by July-end.

The flypast was followed by the Wedgetail performing a ‘touch and go’ on the runway before departing back to Birmingham Airport.

Group Captain Osselton, Programme Director for the E-7 Programme, said: “The Wedgetail appearance at RIAT not only reinforces the hard work and collaboration of all those contributing to the project but also reflects the importance of delivering the next generation of airborne surveillance and control capabilities to support the RAF’s operational effectiveness in the years to come.”

The Red Arrows aircraft flew in formation on the wings of the Boeing aircraft, as a crowd of over 50,000 people looked up at this unique spectacle.

I hope those watching the flypast were able to take plenty of photographs to mark this special mixed formation and true highlight of the 2025 Air Tattoo.”

The E-7 Wedgetail is the most capable and operationally proven airborne early warning and control platform in use today and has the growth path to match the expected threat over the next 20 years.

The mission crew will utilise state-of-the-art workstations to deliver a multi-domain battle management capability: providing situational awareness to UK, NATO and coalition force elements, directing offensive and defensive assets whilst maintaining continuous surveillance of an assigned area. The Wedgetail significantly enhances the lethality and survivability of friendly aircraft and naval assets, whilst operating in a hostile environment.

Stu Voboril, Boeing Vice President and E-7 Programme Manager said: “Today’s flight is an amazing testament to the work of our integrated Boeing and UK supplier team, in partnership with the RAF. Our work reflects the pride we take in supporting the strategic alliance among the UK, US, and allies, and the role the E-7 plays in strengthening global joint force mission advantage.”

The UK’s Wedgetail will serve under No. 8 Squadron and will be located at RAF Lossiemouth, Scotland, alongside the nine-strong fleet of P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, both of which are based upon the widely used Boeing 737 Next Generation airframe, allowing the RAF to take advantage of synergies between the two fleets.",,N,,2025-07-21 12:56:15.188096

The airline also remains cautious regarding airline pricing, fuel costs, competition, aircraft availability, currency exchange rates, and the broader economic environment.","Ryanair Holdings plc, Europe’s largest airline group, has announced a 128 per cent increase in profit after tax for the first quarter of the 2026 financial year.

This significant leap from EUR 360 million in the prior-year Q1 to EUR 820 million was propelled by a 4 per cent rise in traffic to 57.9 million passengers and a substantial 21 per cent increase in average fares to EUR 51.

The Group’s total revenue for the quarter was up by 20% to EUR 4.34 billion and scheduled revenue saw a 26% increase to EUR 2.94 billion, boosted by the full Easter holiday in April, favourable prior-year comparisons, and stronger-than-expected close-in pricing.

Ancillary revenues climbed 7 per cent to EUR 1.39 billion, with the average spend on discretionary services per passenger rising by 3 per cent to over EUR 24.

Despite the revenue growth, Ryanair maintained tight cost control, with operating costs increasing by a modest 5 per cent to EUR 3.42 billion, translating to just a 1 per cent rise per passenger.

Ryanair’s competitive jet fuel hedging largely mitigated the impact of a 16 per cent increase in Air Traffic Control (ATC) fees and higher environmental costs due to EU Emissions Trading System allowances unwinding and Sustainable Aviation Fuel blend mandates.

Ryanair continues to invest heavily in its modern fleet, with 181 Boeing 737-8200s now part of its 618-aircraft fleet. These new aircraft, high-density seating versions of the 737 MAX 8 and dubbed “Gamechangers” by the carrier, offer 4 per cent more seats while consuming 16 per cent less fuel and reducing CO2 emissions.

In Q1 alone, Ryanair took delivery of 5 new aircraft and the Group made a significant USD 500 million commitment to acquire 30 spare CFM LEAP-IB engines, which are expected to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions per seat in its existing fleet by up to 20 per cent.

The airline’s network is expanding rapidly, with over 2,600 routes planned for Summer 2025, including more than 160 new routes. Ryanair is strategically allocating its growth to regions and airports that incentivise traffic growth through reduced aviation taxes.

The company foresees European short-haul capacity remaining constrained until 2030, a situation it believes will allow for controlled profitable growth to 300 million passengers per annum by FY34, leveraging its widening unit cost advantage and robust balance sheet. The first 15 Boeing MAX-10 deliveries are anticipated in Spring 2027, with 300 of these fuel-efficient aircraft due by March 2034.

Ryanair’s balance sheet is supported by a BBB+ credit rating from both Fitch and S&P. The airline maintains an unencumbered B737 fleet of over 590 aircraft. As of 30 June 2025, gross cash stood at a healthy €4.4 billion, with net cash increasing to EUR 2 billion (from EUR 1.3 billion at 31 March).

This strong liquidity positions the Group to comfortably repay approximately EUR 2.1 billion in maturing bonds over the next 10 months using internal cash resources. This financial flexibility is seen as a key factor widening the cost gap between Ryanair and competitors, many of whom face higher financing and aircraft lease costs.

Despite the positive results, Ryanair acknowledges exposure to various external risks, including potential tariff wars, macro-economic shocks, escalation of conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, and disruptions caused by European ATC strikes and short staffing.

The airline also remains cautious regarding airline pricing, fuel costs, competition, aircraft availability, currency exchange rates, and the broader economic environment.",https://www.laranews.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ryanair-kyte.png,N,,2025-07-21 12:56:19.396086

The UK government is consulting on whether to continue classing Uldur as eligible for double counting.
Capturing the moment Another key point in the talks with the government is the capture of CO2, a by-product of bioethanol production, Vivergo said.
Ensus captures 250,000 t/yr of CO2 at its 400mn l/yr bioethanol refinery in Wilton, northeast England.","UK bioethanol producer Vivergo is proceeding with plans to close its 416mn litres/yr Saltend plant in eastern England, but has outlined ways the government could prevent this.

Vivergo has said deliveries of wheat will cease at the end of July, and redundancies will begin in August, ahead of closure in September. It already said it had stopped buying wheat in June.

The decision to close was made by Vivergo's parent company, food and ingredients group Associated British Foods (ABF), after a US-UK trade deal agreed in May that allowed duty-free imports of up to 1.4bn l/yr of US ethanol.

ABF confirmed at the end of June that it was in talks with the government, but no timeline has been put on the process. The first stage of the talks was for UK producers, like Vivergo and Ensus, operator of the 400mn l/yr Wilton bioethanol refinery in northeast England, to submit their strategic business cases. Ensus has said it could close Wilton.

Covering costs

Vivergo told Argus it wants the government to cover losses of £3mn/month, or £35mn/yr, which it said have been incurred as a result of government decisions.

Previously, ABF proposed a support package of £75mn/yr, for up to two years, for the entire UK sector.

In the longer-term, Vivergo said there is appetite from private investors to finance future projects. It pointed to a recent initial agreement to supply ethanol for a prospective alcohol-to-jet sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant planned by hydrogen developer Meld Energy at Saltend.

Meld told Argus that while the project will be ""underpinned by government support mechanisms"", the ""longer term plan is to eventually eliminate reliance on subsidy through reducing cost of production which will likely be through scale, efficiency and technology advancement"".

Meld chief executive Chris Smith also told Argus that sourcing bioethanol directly from Vivergo helped ""risk management"". He said locally-produced bioethanol brings ""greater certainty of supply"" and ""reduces local infrastructure requirements.""

Vivergo said failure to support the bioethanol sector would be ""shortsighted"", because in order to meet projected increases in UK SAF demand by 2035 the country would need ""seven more Vivergos"", or a more than 3.5 times increase in domestic bioethanol production.

Regulation frustration

Vivergo said another key way for the government to help is to tackle the eligibility of unrefined liquid dextrose ultrafiltration retentate (Uldur) for double counting under the UK's renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO).

Uldur, which is classfied in the UK as a waste ethanol feedstock, makes up a significant share of the total import pool from the US.

Biofuels made from certain raw materials classed as ""wastes"" and ""residues"" under the RTFO receive double the amount of renewable transport fuel certificates (RTFCs) for every litre of fuel produced. RTFCs are tradeable credits primarily generated by the sale of biofuel-blended fuels and are used to help obligated parties meet the RTFO mandate.

Vivergo says Uldur-derived ethanol is a co-product of the wet milling process rather than waste, and its eligibility for double counting is inconsistent with the RTFO's decarbonisation aims. It said producers using Uldur are able to make double-counting bioethanol using a more carbon-intensive production process than the fermentation of wheat, yet crop-based ethanol produced by Vivergo is ineligible for double counting.

Vivergo said producers of double counting product get an additional certificate worth around £260/t, meaning it is unable compete with the low prices of Uldur-based bioethanol importers from the US. And these will now be able to enter the UK duty free under the new US-UK trade deal.

The UK government is consulting on whether to continue classing Uldur as eligible for double counting.

Other changes proposed by Vivergo include increasing the ethanol mandate in road fuel, from E10 to E15 or E20. Vivergo previously said an E15 mandate could boost demand in the UK by 660mn l/yr. It also highlighted the potential for increased bioethanol use in marine and aviation sectors.

Capturing the moment

Another key point in the talks with the government is the capture of CO2, a by-product of bioethanol production, Vivergo said.

The company said it is 6-9 months away from having carbon capture facilities ready, at which point it would be capable of meeting around a third of the UK's 600,000 t/yr CO2 demand.

Ensus captures 250,000 t/yr of CO2 at its 400mn l/yr bioethanol refinery in Wilton, northeast England.

Vivergo said losing this would mean increased CO2 imports, and noted its output of high-protein animal feed as a co-product of wheat-to-ethanol production, which agricultural firms would otherwise have to import at a higher environmental cost.

The National Farmers Union has previously said that losing the UK bioethanol industry would be a ""huge blow"", as it currently has the ""capacity to purchase around 2mn t of wheat each year"", so without it ""farmers would lose a reliable market for their feed wheat.""",https://www.argusmedia.com/-/media/project/argusmedia/mainsite/images/14-generic-hero-banners/herobanner_1600x530_generic-c.jpg?h=530&iar=0&w=1600&rev=2cf023b4e0484c1bb091b9f72dbf7771&hash=72DBDFEBEF6EE62E751AB5DD2221C77E,N,,2025-07-21 12:56:53.871827

Market Expansion: The initiative opens access to a broader range of insurance products, reducing political risk and unlocking institutional capital in carbon markets.

Aviation Decarbonization: Supports CORSIA’s legally binding emission offset scheme for international airlines, promoting the issuance of high-integrity carbon credits.

Howden, the global insurance intermediary, has been appointed by Gold Standard to independently assess insurance policies linked to the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). The move aims to de-risk investment in carbon offset projects by identifying insurance products that meet Gold Standard’s stringent eligibility criteria.

The new process supports the first phase of CORSIA (2024–2026) and enables carbon credit developers to access approved insurance options to mitigate political risks, a common barrier to scale in climate finance.

Charlie Pool, Head of Carbon Markets, Climate Risk and Resilience at Howden, said:

“This collaboration marks an important step for carbon markets. By broadening access to insurance products and reducing risks, the partnership will provide additional security, through independent verification, helping buyers purchase with confidence and in compliance with internationally recognised standards.”

CORSIA, developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), mandates that international carriers offset any growth in emissions above baseline levels. All participating airlines are legally required to use either eligible carbon credits or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to meet offset obligations.

The insurance assessment mechanism also helps avoid double counting between international and national carbon targets. Several carbon standards, including Gold Standard, now recognise the role of insurance in mitigating such risks.

Pool added:

“This is a perfect example of how embedded insurance enhances carbon market integrity, in this case supporting the aviation energy transition by allowing the issuance of credible carbon credits and facilitating compliance with CORSIA. The new insurance process will also allow more institutional capital, which was previously held back, to flow into the market, setting an exciting precedent that can be replicated elsewhere to unlock the full potential of carbon markets.”

Margaret Kim, CEO of Gold Standard, emphasized the role of insurance in expanding project eligibility under CORSIA:

“To enable climate action for people and nature, we need to broaden access to new and growing markets, including CORSIA. By recognising insurance policies through a rigorous assessment process and allowing their use to address political risk, we can enable more projects to supply credits for CORSIA’s first phase, in a way that is credible, reliable and based on solid foundations.”

The partnership between Howden and Gold Standard marks a critical step toward establishing scalable, high-integrity carbon markets tailored to the aviation sector’s climate obligations.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-116.png,N,,2025-07-21 13:56:42.696111

As the world's wealthiest individuals demand more from their travel experiences, the private aviation industry is poised to deliver—provided it continues to innovate in luxury, sustainability, and accessibility.","The private aviation industry is experiencing a seismic shift as luxury conglomerates and private equity firms align to capitalize on the growing demand for exclusive, time-saving travel. LVMH's landmark $800 million investment in Flexjet—valuing the private jet company at $4 billion—epitomizes this trend. The move, led by LVMH-backed L Catterton, underscores a strategic convergence of luxury brand equity and private equity's operational rigor, redefining how high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs) experience mobility.

The Strategic Rationale: Luxury Meets Private Equity

LVMH's foray into private aviation is not an isolated bet but a calculated expansion into the luxury experience economy. By acquiring a 20% stake in Flexjet, the French conglomerate leverages its portfolio of 75+ luxury brands—including Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Bulgari—to create a seamless ecosystem of exclusivity. Flexjet, a 30-year industry leader, will now integrate LVMH's design and service DNA, offering members curated experiences such as private terminal access, luxury destination partnerships (e.g., Belmond), and bespoke cabin interiors. This synergy mirrors LVMH's 2018 acquisition of Belmond, which expanded its reach into luxury travel and hospitality.

For Flexjet, the investment unlocks critical resources to modernize its fleet and infrastructure. The company plans to acquire long-range aircraft like Embraer's Praetor series, while expanding its global maintenance network and training programs. With revenue doubling to $3.8 billion in 2024 and EBITDA projected at $425 million in 2025, Flexjet's financials already outperform peers like NetJets (which trades at a 3.5x revenue multiple, versus Flexjet's 5x). LVMH's backing amplifies this momentum, positioning Flexjet to dominate the fractional ownership segment—a market poised to grow at 14.3% CAGR through 2025.

Industry Trends: From Niche to Mainstream

The private aviation sector's rapid growth is driven by three forces:

1. Wealth Polarization: Ultra-wealthy individuals, particularly in tech and crypto, now prioritize privacy, convenience, and customization. Post-pandemic, private jets have become a status symbol akin to supercars or yachts.

2. Fractional Ownership Models: These reduce barriers to entry, allowing clients to pay for usage rather than full ownership. Flexjet's membership-based approach, akin to luxury country clubs, has proven more scalable than NetJets' traditional fractional model.

3. Sustainability Imperatives: Operators are investing in sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) and AI-driven route optimization to meet environmental regulations and consumer expectations. Flexjet's partnership with Embraer for 182 new aircraft includes commitments to greener technologies.

The global private jet rental market is projected to reach $24.28 billion in 2025, with North America accounting for 63.5% of demand. However, regulatory headwinds in Europe—such as the EU's “Fit for 55” carbon policies—pose risks. Companies that innovate in sustainability, like Flexjet, will gain a competitive edge.

Implications for Investors

For investors, the LVMH-Flexjet partnership signals a broader trend: private aviation is transitioning from a niche asset class to a mainstream luxury play. Here's how to position a portfolio:

Direct Exposure to High-Growth Operators: Flexjet's valuation premium and LVMH's brand power make it a compelling long-term hold. Investors should monitor its fleet expansion and EBITDA margins.

Aerospace and MRO Providers: Embraer and Gulfstream (Lockheed Martin) benefit from Flexjet's aircraft orders. Maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) firms like Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. also stand to gain from increased fleet activity.

Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs): Companies like Neste and Aldol Aviation are scaling SAF production, aligning with Flexjet's sustainability goals. ETFs focused on green energy or aerospace innovation (e.g., XLRE) offer diversified access.

Luxury Partnerships: Track collaborations between Flexjet and LVMH brands. These could drive ancillary revenue streams, such as in-flight retail or exclusive travel packages.

Risks and Considerations

While the sector's growth is undeniable, investors must navigate risks:

- Regulatory Pressures: Stricter emissions standards in Europe could hike operating costs.

- Economic Volatility: A slowdown in UHNWI spending could dampen demand.

- Technological Disruption: Electric aircraft or AI-driven concierge services may require rapid adaptation.

Conservative investors should consider diversified aerospace giants like Embraer or Bombardier, while risk-tolerant players might explore private equity funds focused on luxury mobility.

Conclusion: The Future of Travel is Exclusive

LVMH's investment in Flexjet is a masterclass in luxury brand strategy and private equity execution. By merging LVMH's heritage of craftsmanship with Flexjet's operational expertise, the partnership elevates private aviation from a functional service to a curated experience. For investors, this convergence represents a unique opportunity to tap into a sector where exclusivity and innovation are no longer mutually exclusive.

Beyond ethanol’s role in on-road applications, there is tremendous potential for its use in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), particularly via the alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) pathway.
U.S. ethanol is poised to play a critical role in the energy transition.
In response to global demand, U.S. ethanol is consistently improving its carbon intensity score.","As the U.S. Grains Council celebrates its 65th Anniversary this year and hosts its flagship biannual Global Ethanol Summit (GES) in October; it is an opportunity to reaffirm the Council’s steadfast commitment to developing export markets for agricultural products, including increasing visibility around the benefits of ethanol as a fundamental tool to reduce global carbon emissions.

Marketing year 2023/2024 saw a record-setting level of export volumes of U.S. ethanol to the world, reaching 1.746 billion gallons (6.609 billion liters), for a total value of $4.1 billion. This figure does not include exports to Japan. Current ethanol exports are on track for a similar performance this year.

While Canada, the United Kingdom, India and the European Union figure among U.S. top export destination markets, rapid expansion and uptake is also occurring in other less mature global markets. For example, several countries throughout Central America (Costa Rica, Guatemala and Panama) are moving forward with commitments to implement an E10 blending mandate, while Colombia and Peru are exploring ways of increasing current blending rates to higher levels. Similarly, Japan recently announced its intention to transition to E10 by 2023 and E20 by 2040, and the Philippines continues to blend at E10 but allows E20 on a voluntary basis.

Several drivers fuel this demand for U.S. ethanol, including economic, environmental and public health considerations. Concerns about air quality have led many foreign governments to consider ethanol as a readily available resource that provides immediate reductions in outdoor air pollution. Another aspect of USGC’s engagement involves ethanol educational programming, specifically to help raise awareness about the benefits of ethanol and its ability to help countries meet their climate goals.

Beyond ethanol’s role in on-road applications, there is tremendous potential for its use in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), particularly via the alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) pathway. There are also growing opportunities for its use as a sustainable marine fuel (SMF), in the chemical space, household energy and other emerging sectors. Council staff recently travelled to the Philippines, China, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan to showcase how ethanol can play a role in SAF and SMF development, while supporting new research initiatives and engaging with stakeholders.

U.S. ethanol is poised to play a critical role in the energy transition. In response to global demand, U.S. ethanol is consistently improving its carbon intensity score. To be effective as a decarbonization tool, policy frameworks must allow for the use of ethanol in all forms. Policies that constrict ethanol use in the form of feedstock restrictions and/or quantitative limits in favor of other technologies or fuels render the path to carbon neutrality more costly, placing a premium on clean energy and increasing the cost of decarbonization for consumers.

Ethanol production benefits American growers and represents a source of homegrown energy that stimulates rural communities and dynamizes their economies. U.S. ethanol is a readily available and affordable resource supported by existing supply infrastructure with a demonstrated record of effectiveness, and USGC will continue its efforts to assist countries around the world as they integrate this plentiful high-octane oxygenate into their energy matrix.

Estimate Trend

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share of $1.76 has witnessed no downward revision and one upward revision in the past seven days. The estimated figure suggests a decline of 35.06% from the prior-year reported number.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $27.84 billion indicates a 19.29% decline from the year-ago recorded figure.

Factors to Consider

Valero Energy is expected to have maintained a stable performance in the second quarter, owing to high refinery utilization rates during this period. Per the data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, spot prices for West Texas Intermediate Crude dropped nearly 21% from the prior-year quarter’s level. This might have supported the refining player’s profitability by reducing input costs.

Additionally, refining margins improved meaningfully during the quarter, driven by reduced global capacity from shutdowns at major refineries and strong seasonal demand, which boosted crack spreads, particularly benefiting Valero’s low-cost operations. The company’s strategic decision to close its high-cost Benicia refinery also aligns with broader industry consolidation, potentially enhancing future margins. Additionally, Valero has made notable progress in renewable diesel and SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) initiatives, which could have aided the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.

These factors are expected to have positively impacted demand and pricing dynamics, potentially aiding Valero Energy’s quarterly performance.

The pilot project was executed in May, during which 1,000 metric tons of biogenic feedstock were processed.
With this project, INA continues to innovate and efficiently adapt to the requirements of the new energy era,” Goran Pleše, INA Operating Director of Refining and Marketing, said.
INA said it plans to complete all preparatory activities and be ready to ensure continuous supply of SAF to the market by 2029, in line with the European Union’s (EU) Renewable Energy Directive.
Through the directive, the EU set binding targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the share of renewable energy sources in transport.","Croatia’s INA d.d. said its Rijeka refinery in the country has produced sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for the first time.

As part of its efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and align with European renewable energy regulations, the oil company has successfully completed a pilot project to process biogenic feedstock at the hydrocracking unit of the refinery, according to a news release.

In addition to SAF, a significant volume of renewable diesel, or hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), was also produced, the company said.

INA said the project was implemented in collaboration with the unit’s licensor, Chevron Lummus Global (CLG), aiming to test the co-processing of 5 percent palm oil mill effluent, which is a by-product of palm oil production, with fossil feedstocks.

The pilot project was executed in May, during which 1,000 metric tons of biogenic feedstock were processed. The entire process was certified by the independent auditor Bureau Veritas d.o.o., in line with the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification standard for sustainable biofuels, according to the release.

The preparation of the pilot project took eight months “due to the complexity of processing a new type of feedstock and its specific physical and chemical properties,” INA said. The project involved a range of activities, from procuring specialized filters and adapting laboratory methods to increasing the capacities of the hydrocracking and vacuum distillation units and ensuring controlled handling of the biogenic feedstock under existing operating conditions. the company stated.

During the test run, more than 400 samples were collected for detailed analysis conducted at INA’s central testing laboratory, while radiocarbon dating analysis was done on the biogenic content by accredited external laboratories Ruđer Bošković Institute in Zagreb and Isotoptech Zrt. in Debrecen, according to the release.

“Processing biogenic feedstock within existing infrastructure is one of the most efficient ways to decarbonize refinery operations and increase the share of renewables in the transport sector. Thanks to the commitment of our internal team and the collaboration with partners from MOL Group and CLG, we have successfully created the necessary preconditions to meet the future needs of the market and our customers,” Ivica Jerbić, INA Director of Development, said.

“This pilot project has created the foundation for further activities and the introduction of continuous biogenic feedstock processing at the Rijeka Refinery in the near future. With this project, INA continues to innovate and efficiently adapt to the requirements of the new energy era,” Goran Pleše, INA Operating Director of Refining and Marketing, said.

INA said it plans to complete all preparatory activities and be ready to ensure continuous supply of SAF to the market by 2029, in line with the European Union’s (EU) Renewable Energy Directive. Through the directive, the EU set binding targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the share of renewable energy sources in transport. By 2030, EU member states are required to ensure an appropriate share of renewables in the transport sector, with a particular focus on advanced biofuels and SAF, which will play a key role in decarbonizing the aviation industry, according to the release.

The trend of consolidation and collaboration across the aviation sector has continued, where the lengthy timelines frequently being seen for regulatory clearances have in some cases presented issues for parties' transaction timetables. There have also been warnings over partnerships and collaborations that may prematurely cross into action requiring prior regulatory approval.

Regulatory changes and reform have picked up, with significant steps towards ""greening"" the aviation industry. Proposed changes to airline ownership and control in Europe are also now in the offing.

Buoyant M&A activity for airlines

Qatar Airways received conditional clearance from Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) for its 25% stake in Virgin Australia. The FIRB decision follows approval from the Australian competition authority (ACCC) for a codeshare arrangement between the airlines on international flights between Doha and four major Australian cities. Cooperative conduct between the airlines is permitted for five years.

Luxembourg flag carrier, Luxair, has challenged the European Commission's (EC) decision to clear (subject to remedies) Lufthansa's acquisition of a controlling minority interest in ITA. Luxair's appeal to the EU's General Court contends that the Commission failed to conduct a detailed assessment of remedies. Additionally, the airline argues that the EC did not provide relevant information to enable Luxair to contribute to the EC's market testing of whether the proposed remedies were viable and sufficient.

Safran has secured conditional approval for its acquisition of a part of Collins Aerospace's actuation and flight controls business from Brazilian, EU, UK and North American competition authorities. The approval is contingent on Safran divesting its North American actuation business and related assets.

The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is undertaking a merger review of the anticipated acquisition by The Boeing Company of Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc. The merger aims to streamline Boeing's supply chain and improve production efficiency by bringing Spirit's aerostructure operations under Boeing's direct control. The merger is likely to be subject to merger reviews in other key jurisdictions.

The German competition authority (Bundeskartellamt) has given its approval for Lufthansa's acquisition of a 10% minority shareholding in airBaltic. While the Bundeskartellamt noted competitive overlaps, the relevant routes were ""minor markets"" with low revenues and therefore exempt from further review.

A proposed merger between Brazilian carriers Azul and Gol remains under competition review. However, the Brazilian competition authority (CADE) has agreed to a political request to revisit the codeshare arrangement between the two airlines entered into in May 2024 over concerns around potential gun-jumping (when independent firms act in a coordinated way akin to having merged or formed a joint venture prior to obtaining mandatory competition approvals). CADE had initially closed its gun-jumping investigation.

South Korean resort operator Sono Hospital Group (Sono) has become the largest shareholder of T'way Air after acquiring (indirectly) a 46.26% stake in T'way Holdings. The acquisition has been approved by the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC). Sono already holds the second-largest shareholding in Air Premia, although it has announced that it intends to sell off its shares.

In March, the KFTC and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport agreed to jointly monitor a set of remedies tied to Korean Air's acquisition of Asiana Airlines. Implementation of the remedies, adjusted by the KFTC in December, will be overseen by the ministry over the next 10 years. Asiana Airlines is facing an investigation by the KFTC as to whether fare changes made by the airline constitute non-compliance with the conditions.

DSV announced it had obtained all necessary regulatory clearances for its €14.3 billion acquisition of global freight forwarding and contract logistics business Schenker AG. This included clearance under the EU's new Foreign Subsidy Regulation.

Following the longest review suspension in China's recent merger history, ANA Holdings' acquisition of Nippon Cargo Airlines finally received conditional approval from the Chinese competition authority. The conditions include a requirement on ANA Holdings to continue existing cargo ground-service agreements, to provide fair services to new market entrants and to transfer a maximum of seven weekly cargo flights between Tokyo Narita and Shanghai Pudong to new entrants. The delays in securing this approval highlight the importance of accurately mapping out merger control timelines and risks.

Air France-KLM has announced that it intends to take a majority stake in SAS. Through an acquisition of the shares currently held by Castlelake and Lind Invest, Air France will increase its holding in the Scandinavian carrier from 19.9% to 60.5%.

Joint ventures and cooperation agreements

The CMA has provisionally accepted commitments offered by the five airlines party to the Atlantic Joint Business Agreement. The agreement facilitates cooperation between British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus, American Airlines and Finnair on the pricing and schedules of their transatlantic networks. To mitigate the CMA's concerns, the airlines have offered to provide slots to competitors at London Heathrow and London Gatwick, and to carry a minimum number of ""local passengers"" annually on the London-Dallas route. The commitments package was strengthened following initial market testing in the spring to include, among other things, additional slot commitments on the London-Boston route.

In March, the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) approved a cooperation agreement between Singapore Airlines and All Nippon Airways. Approval was conditional on commitments, including obligations to maintain seat capacity, develop and submit business plans, report flight schedules/individual capacity levels and appoint an independent auditor to report on compliance to the CCCS annually.

The CCCS has also given conditional clearance for commercial cooperation between Singapore Airlines and Malaysia Airlines. The agreement includes expanded codesharing of flights and partnering on the scheduling, pricing and marketing of routes between Singapore and Malaysia. The CCCS accepted commitments from the airlines to maintain pre-cooperation seat capacity, report on the operations of their respective low-cost carriers and appoint an independent auditor.

Etihad and Ethiopian Airlines have signed a strategic partnership agreement, featuring a codeshare arrangement and new flight routes. The collaboration, which remains subject to regulatory approval, will see the airlines launching new flights between Abu Dhabi and Addis Ababa. Etihad has also recently secured further partnerships with STARLUX, China Eastern and TAP Air Portugal.

Virgin Atlantic, Delta Air Lines and Air France-KLM have announced a partnership with IndiGo. The partnership will enable IndiGo to expand its long-haul network into Europe and North America. The other partners will gain links into India.

Competition and antitrust enforcement

The Dutch competition authority (ACM) has launched a market investigation into computer-controlled consumer prices in the aviation sector. The ACM seeks to understand how the prices are calculated and the effects that such algorithms and prices have on consumers.

Italy's Competition Authority (AGCM) has accused Ryanair of failing to provide accurate and complete information during the authority's abuse of dominance probe. Concurrently, Ryanair has expressed its intention to escalate its challenges to the AGCM investigation. This comes after the airline failed to overturn both Irish and Italian court rulings on the legitimacy of the AGCM's request that its Irish counterpart assist with the raids on Ryanair's Dublin offices that took place in 2024.

India's competition authority (CCI) has cleared GMR Airports of alleged anti-competitive practices at Indira Gandhi International Airport. The alleged monopolistic practices included GMR foregoing competitive bidding processes for parking and lounge service contracts. Complainants also argued that GMR had charged excessive fees on related tenders. The CCI rejected the complaint.

After many years of litigation, Singapore Airlines and Singapore Airlines Cargo announced that they had reached a settlement with the EC relating to interest on an overturned fine. The initial antitrust investigation into the airlines began in 2007. A similar settlement was recently agreed between the EC and Cathay Pacific Airways.

The US Supreme Court has rejected a petition to review a lower court's decision upholding an injunction against the operations of the Northeast Alliance, the joint venture between American Airlines and JetBlue. The joint venture was blocked by lower courts due to competition concerns in the domestic market for air travel.

Aircalin submitted remedies to the New Caledonian Competition Authority to resolve an investigation into the airline's commission system for travel agents. Aircalin introduced an incentive-based payment system for travel agencies, prompting concerns that the mechanism could distort competition by favouring Aircalin's integrated travel agency.

Regulatory developments – much more to come in 2025

The EC has published its long-awaited Clean Industrial Deal, outlining its strategy to ""accelerate decarbonisation and competitiveness"" across the European industry. A Sustainable Transport Investment Plan will support specific renewable and low-carbon fuels for the aviation sector, while the newly adopted Clean Industrial Deal State Aid Framework (CISAF) simplifies subsidy rules to support companies transitioning to green energy sources.

The EC also recently provided clarity on the implementation of ReFuelEU Aviation, the regulation mandating a greater portion of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the industry. It published a report evaluating the SAF market in the EU and potential improvements to the SAF flexibility mechanism.

Further direction has been provided by the EC in relation to the Renewable Energy Directive. The Commission has published updated guidance specifying a methodology for calculating the greenhouse gas emissions savings achieved through the use of low-carbon fuels.

Regulatory action to drive greater use of SAF fuels has also progressed in the UK, with the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Bill introduced to Parliament in May 2025. The legislation, which will establish a revenue certainty mechanism for SAF producers (guaranteeing set payments for fuel), is expected to be in place by the end of 2026. The bill is currently at the Committee Stage in the UK's House of Commons.

In May, the EC published a call for evidence regarding an upcoming revision of the Air Services Regulation. The regulation outlines the conditions for carriers to obtain operating licences and reshapes the governance of EU airlines. A proposal revising the regulation to increase resilience, competition and sustainability is planned for the second quarter of 2026.

The UK government has announced its plans to modernise flight paths in the ""largest redesign"" of UK airspace since its formation in the 1950s. The UK Airspace Design Service, put to Parliament at the end of May, aims to create more efficient and direct flight paths to bring both consumer and environmental benefits. The service is set to be fully operational by the end of 2025.

COVID-19 support to airlines remains in the spotlight

In Brussels, the EC is investigating Lufthansa for non-compliance with the conditions attached to its €6 billion recapitalisation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The EC's concerns relate to a ban on dividend payments and prohibitions on funding subsidiaries that were struggling before the pandemic. The investigation comes at the same time as Lufthansa's appeal to the EU's top court to reinstate EC approval for the recapitalisation aid.

All of these people will need to travel in some regard to get to events and many will be using of single use plastics, like water bottles and snack packaging, to keep fuelled on the go.

This is not to mention the emissions that artists themselves contribute from travelling to each tour destination with equipment.

This is something Coldplay has pledged to tackle in its most recent tour, with an aim to make fans as environmentally aware as possible.

How Coldplay reduces its CO₂ emissions

Coldplay reports that it reduced consumption and extensively recycles, cutting CO₂ emissions by more than 50%.

The tour has tried to make itself as environmentally beneficial as possible by funding nature and technology-based projects and drawing down significantly more CO₂ than the tour produces.

The tour is supporting:

Reforestation

Rewilding

Conservation

Soil regeneration

Carbon capture and storage

Where the tour cannot reduce emissions, the band says it will tackle these using guidance from the Oxford Principles for net zero aligned carbon offsetting.

The band has teamed up with DHL, one of the leading companies in sustainable transport and logistics, offering solutions to minimise logistics-related emissions and other environmental impacts.

What is DHL doing to reduce the tour's emissions?

DHL says that it started with a carbon intelligence and monitoring system to get a view of the tour's carbon footprint, laying the foundation to identify where best to optimise operations.

Through monitoring, DHL found that more than 80% of the CO₂ emissions came from transporting equipment by air.

DHL created GoGreen Plus, using carbon insetting allowing customers to directly reduce emissions at the source. For example, air freight carriers for the brand can purchase Sustainable Aviation Fuel from GoGreen Plus, resulting in a fuel life-cycle reduction of 85% per flight.

“We've been highly impressed by DHL’s commitment to sustainability,” says Coldplay’s Co-Manager, Phil Harvey.

During the tour, DHL transported the tour wristbands between venues in trucks that use sustainable fuel.

How is Coldplay using sustainable power?

In the build up to each show, solar photovoltaic panels are installed behind each stage to charge batteries for when the band arrives at the venue.

Coldplay partnered with BMW to develop the world's first rechargeable show battery, made from recyclable BMW i3 batteries, meaning 100% of the show could be powered with renewable energy.

The band installed kinetic floors around the stadium, meaning the fans’ dancing will help power the show through the energy captured.

Coldplay is also using renewable diesel, a biofuel made from hydrotreated vegetable oil.

How Coldplay makes its shows more sustainable

Coldplay says that stages are built from lightweight, low-carbon and reusable materials including recycled steel which can be reused or recycled at the end of the tour.

LED wristbands worn by audiences are 100% compostable, made from plant based materials, alongside being reused each show to reduce production by 80%.

The show now uses low energy LED laser and lighting systems and a PA system that uses up to 50% less power alongside reducing environmental noise outside the venue.

The band also uses 100% biodegradable confetti and a new generation of pyrotechnics that have less explosive charge and new formulas that reduce harmful chemicals.

Social and fan impact

Coldplay have partnered with SAP to create a free app that offers advice to fans on how to use low carbon transport to and from the show.

All fans that commit to low carbon travel to the show will be rewarded a discount code.

The tour includes onsite activation energy zones, powered by solar and kinetic energy, that have interactive and educational experiences explaining clean technology and the natural world.

Fans are encouraged to bring refillable water bottles to the venue where refill stations will be provided for them.

Where possible, merchandise is made of natural fibres and recyclable elements and packaged in recycled paper or compostable bags.

Coldplay released a statement saying: “We’re happy to report that direct CO₂​​​​​​​ emissions from the first two years of this tour are 59% less than our previous stadium tour (2016-17), on a show-by-show comparison. These figures have been verified by the MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative.

“We’d like to say a huge thank you to our incredible touring family and to all the brilliant people who’ve made this possible.

“Most of all, we’d like to thank everyone who’s come to a show and helped charge the show batteries on the power bikes and kinetic dance floors; everyone who’s arrived by foot, bike, ride share or public transport; everyone who’s come with refillable water bottles or returned their LED wristband for recycling; and everyone who’s bought a ticket, which means you’ve planted one of 7 million trees so far.

According to the report, India must mobilize around $1.5 trillion by 2030 to transform its energy sector, cut emissions, and strengthen climate resilience across the economy.

Scale of India’s Climate and Energy Commitments

India’s climate ambitions are sweeping. The country has announced its intent to achieve net zero emissions by 2070 and to reduce greenhouse gas emission intensity by 45% from 2005 levels by 2030. Central to these ambitions is the target of reaching 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity in the power sector by 2030.

Currently, India has built up 242.8 GW of non-fossil fuel power, including 184.62 GW from renewable sources, 49.38 GW from large hydropower, and 8.78 GW from nuclear energy. This represents about half of the country’s total installed capacity of 484.8 GW, but to meet its 2030 pledge, India needs to almost double this capacity in just five years—a scale of growth that stands out globally.

Renewable Energy: The Foundation of the Transition

Deloitte estimates that the expansion of renewable energy alone will require $200–250 billion by 2030. Investments will be needed not just in developing new solar and wind power plants, but also in scaling up advanced manufacturing, integrating renewables into the national grid, and expanding transmission systems. As the report states, “India will have to add 300GW of RE capacity by 2030… reaching this goal will need around $200–250 billion in investment by 2030, covering areas such as advanced manufacturing, grid integration and system expansion.”

The Challenge of Energy Storage

A major hurdle in India’s clean energy drive is managing the variability of renewable sources like solar and wind. To ensure reliable, round-the-clock electricity, Deloitte highlights the need to scale up energy storage infrastructure by eight times by FY30, requiring $250–300 billion in investment. Accelerating battery storage, pumped hydro, and other advanced storage solutions will be vital for maintaining grid stability as renewables increasingly power the nation.

Green Fuels: Powering Industry and Transport

India’s clean energy transformation goes beyond electricity. The government’s policies on ethanol blending and sustainable aviation fuel are expected to drive $75–80 billion in biofuels investment. Meanwhile, the National Green Hydrogen Mission—targeting annual production of 5 million metric tonnes by 2030—is set to attract $90–100 billion. Developing these green fuels will reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels, cut emissions, and help position India as a global green energy hub.

Resilient Infrastructure and Broader Climate Action

Building a climate-resilient India will require strategic investment in water management, climate-smart agriculture, sustainable transport, digital infrastructure, and waste management. Upgrading these sectors is projected to require more than $80 billion for water and agriculture alone, and as much as $650 billion for transforming transport systems.

Prashanth Nutula, a partner at Deloitte India, stresses that “a comprehensive strategy that aligns infrastructure, waste management and digital transformation will be crucial in creating resilient, future-ready communities and positioning India as a true pioneer in sustainable development.”

Financing: Mobilizing Capital at Scale

Meeting India’s climate targets at this scale calls for innovative financing beyond public budgets. Viral Thakker, Deloitte South Asia’s sustainability leader, points out that “financial instruments, such as green bonds, climate funds and blended finance models, are important in mobilising capital for sustainability initiatives.”

Unlocking these capital flows is key for long-term resilience, job creation, and protecting vulnerable communities from climate risks. As Thakker notes, “By strategically harnessing climate finance, India can accelerate its decarbonisation efforts, offering immense investment potential in sectors poised for sustainable growth and innovation.”

The Path Forward

Deloitte’s latest research offers a clear-eyed view of the investment challenge India faces in realizing its climate and clean energy aspirations. The stakes are not just environmental—they are deeply economic and social. Transforming this $1.5 trillion challenge into an opportunity could safeguard India’s development gains, ensuring prosperity, security, and sustainability for decades to come.",https://marksmendaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Marksmen-Daily-2025-07-21T110427.035-1000x600.webp,N,,2025-07-21 10:56:55.723343

The Science Based Targets initiative’s (SBTi) draft revision of its Corporate Net Zero Standard suggests offering a more pragmatic approach for companies to substantiate progress against targets. We explore this approach, including the short-term use of market-based instruments to address the operational reality that full traceability isn’t always possible in today’s context.

Background

The SBTi has recently published a draft revision of its Corporate Net Zero Standard.1 Designed to accelerate corporate decarbonisation, the draft suggests modifying the target-setting process for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. In this series, we explore the following key topics:

Long-term Scope 3 targets: there is no requirement for companies to set long-term Scope 3 targets, which risks weakening climate ambition and decarbonisation trajectories.

Scope 3 requirements for category A and B companies: separate Scope 3 criteria are proposed for companies based on their size and location. ’Category A’ companies constitute large companies or medium-sized companies in high and upper-middle-income countries. Other medium-sized, small and micro companies fall under ‘Category B’.

Indirect mitigation in the value chain: the SBTi has introduced guidance on the use of indirect emissions mitigation to support corporate decarbonisation pathways, such as the use of a book-and-claim approach for sustainable aviation fuel.

The draft revision aims to support corporate decarbonisation while remaining pragmatic in its expectations around data and ambition. Some changes will make it easier to set targets and encourage greater uptake. They also run the risk of creating ambiguity. In this series on the SBTi’s proposed changes, our experts examine their implications and the fine line that exists between showing pragmatism in corporate decarbonisation and safeguarding long-term emissions reductions.

Rethinking the rules: Activity pool and indirect mitigation

In the current version of the SBTi Corporate Net Zero Standard Criteria, only direct mitigation is accepted for substantiating progress against science-based Net Zero targets. While direct mitigation remains the priority in the new draft standard, the SBTi proposes to allow for the limited, temporary use of activity pools and indirect mitigation for Scope 3 emissions under specific conditions.

If direct traceability to specific emissions sources cannot be established, companies may be able to show progress on their Scope 3 targets through interventions at the activity pool level. This involves identifying a group of emissions sources that are not directly traceable to a specific origin but can be linked to a defined region or boundary. For example, a supply shed where a company sources a specific commodity such as wheat but cannot trace it back to the exact farm that the commodity comes from.

Furthermore, in limited cases where direct mitigation and activity pools are not possible, companies would be able to use indirect mitigation using energy and commodity certificates, as a time limited measure. Book-and-claim systems is the most common indirect mitigation method, allowing companies to claim emission reductions or other sustainability benefits associated with a product without physically receiving that product.

Potential impact of greater flexibility in the Net Zero Standard

The proposed changes provide a more realistic pathway for companies with complex value chains in sectors where direct mitigation can be challenging. Previously these companies may have either not set a target at all or addressed a narrower range of emissions sources in their value chain, whereas the proposed change is aimed at incentivising action in complex value chains where there is a lack of traceability.

By investing in indirect mitigation through market-based instruments, companies can influence industry trends that help drive demand for low-carbon alternatives, even when full traceability isn’t possible. Over time, these market signals can contribute to the broader transformation of value chains, making low-emission options more accessible and widespread, leading to transparency and disclosure requests being commonplace.

However, important questions are left unanswered by the current draft — particularly around when and how these tools should be used. While the SBTi has confirmed that companies will be required to justify the use of indirect mitigation over direct action, the current lack of detailed guidance may create uncertainty and could delay the structural decarbonisation that Net Zero targets demand.

The draft states that indirect mitigation must contribute to a Net Zero-aligned transformation relevant to the company’s value chain. To prevent misinterpretation or misuse, the SBTi should provide robust guidance on what constitutes a ‘Net Zero-aligned transformation’ — including sectoral benchmarks, credible examples and alignment with global climate goals.

There are also practical hurdles. Without transparent, verifiable methodologies, companies risk misreporting progress or double counting reductions — undermining both accountability and actual progress.

Increasing traceability in your supply chain: Where to start

Direct decarbonisation of company value chains should remain the bedrock of any credible Net Zero strategy, cutting emissions at the source and strengthening traceability through proactive supply chain engagement.

Yet, the reality is that accurate emissions measurement and reporting remain out of reach for many companies without improved traceability.

A strong first step for companies looking to improve their emissions data would be to conduct a comprehensive supply chain assessment to evaluate traceability and uncover opportunities for emissions reductions. This means mapping key suppliers, understanding what they provide and identifying gaps in emissions data — particularly where data is missing or unreliable.

To help close these gaps, companies should focus on suppliers with both high emissions intensity and limited traceability. Larger organisations can play a vital role in supporting these suppliers by:

Selecting targeted engagement strategies based on supplier profiles and clearly communicating the purpose of the collaboration.

Building long-term, strategic relationships that strengthen suppliers’ ability to decarbonise and report transparently.

Backing traceability initiatives aimed at collecting supplier-specific data to improve emissions accuracy.

Working directly with suppliers to help reduce their emissions at source.

These efforts will help suppliers gain the confidence and resources needed to invest in low-carbon technologies, ultimately contributing to more resilient and decarbonised value chains.

Only where gaps persist should companies turn to emerging guidance on indirect mitigation to complement direct efforts.

However, these measures must remain temporary, clearly justified, and transparently reported — and must never substitute for lasting, direct decarbonisation.

Additionally, your organisation may choose to take part in the pilot for SBTi’s draft Corporate Net Zero standard v2. The deadline for phase one of the pilot is 15 August 2025.

In 1Q26, Ryanair welcomed 57.9 million travelers, slightly more (up 4%) than in 1Q25, when 55.5 million passengers boarded its aircraft.
The low-cost carrier expects that the plane maker should certify the 737 MAX 10, of which Ryanair has 300 on order, in late 2025.
In terms of the short-term outlook, the airline stated that Boeing’s delivery delays continue to impact its 206 million passenger target for FY26.
However, Ryanair warned that 1Q26 fares will be lower than in 1Q26, while still expecting to recover the 7% fare decline it suffered in 1Q25.","Ryanair has reported its 1Q26 financial results, with the low-cost carrier, which had previously admitted to opting for lower yields to sustain its load factors during the previous quarters, increasing its revenue per passenger and more than doubling its Q1 after-tax profit (PAT) compared to the same period last year.

On July 21, the Irish low-cost carrier group unveiled an €820 million ($954.7 million) PAT as total revenues rose by 20% compared to 1Q25 to €4.34 billion ($5 billion). Revenue per passenger grew 15% year-on-year (YoY), with the airline’s average fare growing by 21% YoY to €51 ($59.3).

In comparison, 1Q25 total revenues were €3.6 billion ($4.1 billion), while PAT was €360 million ($418.9 million). Last fiscal year’s first quarter average fare per passenger was €42 ($49.8), with load factors remaining flat YoY. In 1Q26, Ryanair welcomed 57.9 million travelers, slightly more (up 4%) than in 1Q25, when 55.5 million passengers boarded its aircraft.

Michael O’Leary, CEO of Ryanair, remarked that Q1 substantially benefited from having a complete Easter in April, “weak prior-year comps, and marginally stronger than expected close-in pricing.” In 2024, Easter fell on March 31.

O’Leary noted that ancillary revenues rose 7% YoY to €1.39 billion ($1.6 billion), while operating costs increased to €3.42 billion ($3.9 billion) as the company’s jet fuel hedging offset rising air traffic control (ATC) fees. These, accounted as route charges in its financial report, surged by 16% YoY to €356 million ($414.4 million), “primarily due to significantly higher Eurocontrol/ATC rates and a 4% increase in flight hours.”

However, as Neil Sorahan, CFO of Ryanair, pointed out during the pre-recorded question-and-answer session, environmental expenses are expected to increase for the carrier. Sorahan stated that it was a “big number” that was included in the airline’s fuel expenses last year, or €850 million ($989.4 million), while during this fiscal year, environment-related costs are estimated to be €1.1 billion ($1.2 billion) due to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blend mandates. According to the CFO, “it is remarkable that none of this gets recycled back into environmental projects across Europe.”

At the end of the quarter, Ryanair had 181 Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 aircraft in its fleet, 25 more than in 1Q25, with its total fleet comprising 618 aircraft. The fleet growth is expected to facilitate increased passenger traffic, reaching 206 million by the end of FY26. The Irish airline, which has multiple subsidiaries across Europe, stated that it remains “confident that the 29 remaining [737 MAX 8-200] in our 210 orderbook will deliver well ahead of [summer 2026], when we hope to recover this year’s delayed traffic growth into FY27.”

In addition, Ryanair pointed out that Boeing reached the 38-per-month production rate of the 737 MAX in May, its current monthly limit imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) following the mid-air door plug blowout of Alaska Airlines flight AS1282 in January 2024.

The low-cost carrier expects that the plane maker should certify the 737 MAX 10, of which Ryanair has 300 on order, in late 2025. The first 737 MAX 10s should arrive in the airline’s fleet in spring 2027, with the aircraft, which Ryanair said offer 20% more seats at 228 per aircraft, and 20% lower fuel burn, facilitating the carrier’s growth to 800 aircraft and 300 million passengers per year by the end of FY34.

In terms of the short-term outlook, the airline stated that Boeing’s delivery delays continue to impact its 206 million passenger target for FY26. Despite this, its cost-controlling measures should offset the growing environmental expenses. However, Ryanair warned that 1Q26 fares will be lower than in 1Q26, while still expecting to recover the 7% fare decline it suffered in 1Q25.

“The final H1 outcome is, however, heavily dependent on the strength of close-in Aug. and Sept. bookings,” the airline stated. At this time, it has zero H2 visibility and has indicated that it was too early to provide meaningful FY26 PAT guidance; yet, Ryanair expects to reverse the full-year fare decline, resulting in “reasonable net profit growth in FY26.”

The overall aim is to create a healthy EU SAF market and unlock investment into SAF production in the EU, as well as ensuring competitiveness of the EU aviation industry and SAF value chain.","Substantial investment is required to develop and deploy SAF at scale.

Stakeholders across the aviation industry ecosystem have reiterated their commitment to the decarbonisation of air transport. However, they have underlined that accelerating the availability and affordability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is essential to achieving the European Union (EU) and aviation industry climate goal of net zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

Organisations, including Destination 2050, FuelsEurope, Hydrogen Europe, Project SkyPower, European Express Association and European Cargo Alliance have highlighted that the Draghi report on European underscores that decarbonisation is a competitive challenge for hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation. Decarbonisation of the aviation sector is expected to cost around EUR61 billion annually. Furthermore, EU demand requires the construction of circa 12 new industrial-scale first-of-a-kind e-SAF plants.

Aviation is also critical to socio-economic growth. In addition to providing vital connectivity, in 2019 figures show that the industry supported 14 million jobs and EUR 851 billion to GDP in Europe.

Transitioning to a net zero industry requires substantial investment to develop and deploy SAF, to upgrade infrastructure and to support technological innovations within the industry. The EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative has largely stimulated bio-SAF production capacity, with around 1.2 million tonnes of the fuel produced in 2014. Achieving the higher overall targets and the e-SAF sub-target in 2030 and beyond is dependent on the unlocking of private investment, which today is hindered by high capital costs, regulatory complexity and a lack of market-based de-risking instruments.

While the EU’s ReFuel Aviation is described as the “backbone” of Europe’s SAF strategy, its success relies on swift, coordinated action to resolve the investment and implementation barriers.

Critical challenges

The market for commercially available HEFA-produced SAF remains nascent, with the corresponding challenge of the high cost gap with conventional kerosene and possible competitive gap with non-EU airlines and SAF producers.

In addition, next-generation SAF pathways, notably e-SAF and advanced biofuels, continue to face strong challenges in securing investment decisions for commercial deployment. To date, with the exception of one small pilot-scale project, none of the 40+ EU e-SAF commercially-full-scale projects have reached final investment decision (FID).

In response the aviation industry is urging policymakers at EU and national levels to take swift action and work alongside industry stakeholders to ensure a timely and robust ramp-up of SAF in Europe.

With emissions from air travel accounting for 2.5% of global CO₂ output, regulatory pressure, corporate commitments, and technological innovation are converging to make Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) a cornerstone of the net-zero economy. As of July 2025, SAF production capacity has surged to 30,000 barrels per day (b/d) in the U.S. and is projected to hit 15.5 million tonnes globally by 2030. This rapid growth, coupled with structural bottlenecks and policy tailwinds, creates a compelling investment thesis for infrastructure, production, and technology players.

Policy-Driven Demand and the Race to Scale

The EU's ReFuelEU Aviation mandate (2% SAF blending by 2025) and the U.S. SAF Grand Challenge (3 billion gallons annually by 2030) have created a regulatory floor for demand. These policies are already reshaping supply chains. For example, the EU's reliance on imported feedstocks like used cooking oil (UCO) and soybean oil has driven up prices and created a premium for producers with secure, traceable feedstock access. Similarly, U.S. projects like Phillips 66's 10,000-b/d and Diamond Green Diesel's 15,000-b/d facilities are leveraging the Inflation Reduction Act's 45Z tax credit to expand capacity.

However, policy alone is not enough. Structural bottlenecks—such as limited feedstock availability, fragmented collection systems, and underdeveloped distribution networks—threaten to slow progress. For instance, the U.S. currently produces SAF at 30,000 b/d but faces a 2030 feedstock gap as demand outstrips supply of UCO and animal fats. This creates an urgent need for alternative pathways like e-SAF (green hydrogen + CO₂) and alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) technologies, which are still in early commercialization but hold long-term scalability.

Investment Opportunities in Infrastructure and Production

The SAF supply chain offers three distinct investment layers:

Feedstock Logistics and Collection Systems

The lack of standardized UCO collection networks in regions like Asia-Pacific and Europe presents a critical gap. Independent traders control 80% of UCO in Asia, leading to inefficiencies and high costs. Companies building digital platforms to aggregate and trace feedstock—such as startups leveraging blockchain for transparency—could capture significant value. Similarly, waste segregation and pre-treatment infrastructure for municipal solid waste (MSW) and agricultural residues will become essential as HEFA's feedstock limitations become apparent.

Production Facilities and Technology Innovation

The U.S. and Asia are leading in SAF production, but Europe lags behind, with only 30% of announced projects under construction. This underdevelopment highlights opportunities for firms building modular, plug-and-play SAF plants or retrofitting existing refineries. For example, co-processing refineries (which blend SAF with conventional jet fuel) and standalone renewable diesel-to-SAF facilities are gaining traction. Investors should also monitor companies developing next-gen technologies like e-SAF, which could become a $100 billion market by 2040.

Distribution and Airport Infrastructure

Existing jet fuel infrastructure is incompatible with SAF blending at scale. Airports and fuel service providers face a $20–30 billion investment need to upgrade storage tanks, pipelines, and delivery systems. China's Civil Aviation Administration is already testing SAF refueling trials, while the U.S. is incentivizing airport upgrades through federal grants. This creates a niche for engineering firms and EPC contractors with expertise in aviation fuel logistics.

Data-Driven Insights and Market Dynamics

The SAF market is highly capital-intensive, with production costs currently 3–5 times higher than conventional jet fuel. However, costs are expected to decline as scale increases and policy incentives mature. For example, the 45Z tax credit in the U.S. provides up to $1.29 per gallon for SAF produced from non-ILUC feedstocks, a critical bridge until production becomes economically viable. Investors should also monitor the 45Z extension beyond 2027, as its expiration could disrupt momentum.

Risks and Strategic Considerations

While the long-term outlook is positive, near-term risks include:

- Feedstock Competition: SAF producers face headwinds from renewable diesel demand for road transport, driving up soybean oil and tallow prices.

- Policy Uncertainty: Delays in EU blending mandates or U.S. tax credit extensions could slow adoption.

- Technological Hurdles: e-SAF and FT (Fischer-Tropsch) pathways require breakthroughs in green hydrogen production and carbon capture.

To mitigate these risks, investors should prioritize companies with diversified feedstock portfolios, strong policy alignment, and partnerships with airlines or airports. For example, firms securing long-term supply contracts with major carriers like United or Lufthansa can lock in demand and reduce exposure to market volatility.

Conclusion: A Multi-Decade Transition

The SAF industry is at an inflection point. With global demand set to reach 196 million tonnes by 2050 and policy frameworks solidifying, investors have a unique opportunity to back the infrastructure and technology that will decarbonize aviation. The next five years will be critical in determining whether SAF becomes a foundational pillar of net-zero aviation or remains a niche solution. For those willing to navigate the early-stage risks, the rewards are substantial: a sector poised to grow at 30%+ annually, backed by trillions in global climate commitments.

In the coming months, watch for companies securing feedstock supply chains, securing government contracts, and pioneering next-gen technologies.

As U.S. airlines begin hitting their centennial -- American follows next year and United turns 100 in 2031 -- it's fun to consider what the flight experience was like in those early years.

It's also worth thinking about what dramatic transformations lie in airlines' future.

Aviation historian Shea Oakley spoke with me recently about the Douglas DC-3, a revolutionary aircraft for its time, which entered service in 1936. With its 21 seats, the DC-3 was the first aircraft with which airlines could make a profit through passenger service alone, without necessarily relying on mail delivery.

But to fly on the DC-3, or any aircraft, during the first decades of the airline industry meant subjecting oneself to plenty of discomfort and a fair bit of danger.

The first pressurized aircraft didn't appear until 1940, meaning flights had to stay low, where they are especially subject to turbulence.

Seats, Oakley said, were often metal or wicker.

Weather frequently grounded planes. And it was so noisy in the cabin that passengers would sometimes communicate by passing notes.

Further, crashes were much more common. Between 1930 and 1937, U.S. airlines with loads of at least three people had 45 accidents, according to PlaneCrashInfo.com.

""It was just a miserable experience,"" Oakley said. ""It was adventurous but miserable.""

Modern technology has solved many of those early pitfalls. Sure, economy flying isn't very comfortable, but that's a relative concern. Crash rates are way down. There's no need to scream to be heard. And planes fly high above the clouds, with satellite tracking and communications capabilities to, in many cases, steer clear of turbulence.

But back in the 1920s, human-induced climate change wasn't a known phenomenon, and airlines needn't worry about carbon emissions.

Over the next generations, solving the emissions problem will be the aviation industry's biggest challenge.

The global airline industry has committed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. And while it's unclear if that lofty target is attainable, the pressure on airlines to fly cleaner isn't likely to substantially abate in the coming decades.

For now, flying the most modern planes with the densest seat configurations is the most effective way for airlines to reduce their per-passenger carbon footprint, as a recent analysis by industry data provider Cirium illustrated. But over the next several decades, a dramatic ramp-up in the production of sustainable aviation fuel, coupled further down the line with the realization of new flying technologies, are the path toward true transformation.

Already, numerous companies are at work on electric flying solutions geared toward being viable for commercial airlines, at least on short routes, as battery technology improves.

Zero-emissions, hydrogen-powered aircraft capable of covering long distances are also part of flying's future, even though Airbus has stepped back from its earlier goal of introducing a hydrogen-powered narrowbody by 2035.

And new aircraft shapes, especially the blended wing design under development by JetZero and other aviation startups, have the potential to reduce emissions by 50% through aerodynamic improvements.

Flying today is nothing like it was when Delta got into the passenger air business. But where safety, range and comfort were the big frontiers for the industry during its early years, efficiency is now the north star.",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/TW/uploadedImages/All_TW_Art/TWSTF/RobertSilk300x171.jpg?n=6273&tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-07-21 10:57:40.634531

Upaya untuk mengurangi emisi karbon itu salah satunya lewat Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Harsono Budi Santoso, Direktur Perencanaan & Pengembangan Bisnis Pertamina Patra Niaga menyampaikan SAF merupakan bagian dari strategi jangka panjang perusahaan dalam menyediakan energi lebih bersih dan berkelanjutan sekaligus mendukung target Net Zero Emission (NZE) 2060.

“Dalam dua tahun terakhir, kami telah melakukan tiga kali uji pasar SAF serta proses sertifikasi di seluruh rantai distribusi, mulai dari terminal BBM hingga depot pengisian bahan bakar pesawat udara. Ini kami lakukan untuk memastikan produk SAF yang kami distribusikan memenuhi standar industri dan siap digunakan oleh pelanggan (maskapai penerbangan),” kata Harsono dalam keterangannya, Minggu (20/7/2025).

Harsono menekankan pentingnya kolaborasi lintas sektor untuk mempercepat adopsi SAF secara nasional, sejalan dengan Peta Jalan SAF yang telah dicanangkan pemerintah.

“Kami tengah menjajaki kemitraan strategis dengan penyedia teknologi agar pengembangan SAF dapat dilakukan lebih luas. Ini merupakan langkah strategis kami dalam mendukung keberlanjutan energi dan mendorong pertumbuhan ekonomi hijau,” ujarnya.

Selain SAF, Pertamina Patra Niaga juga telah meluncurkan produk bahan bakar rendah karbon lainnya, seperti Biosolar dan Pertamax Green 95, yang menjadi bagian penting dalam perjalanan dekarbonisasi produk hilir Pertamina.

Dengan kesiapan infrastruktur dan pengalaman panjang dalam penyaluran energi, Pertamina Patra Niaga optimistis bahwa SAF akan menjadi game changer dalam mendukung komitmen Indonesia terhadap pengurangan emisi karbon sekaligus membuka peluang baru di sektor energi terbarukan.

“Kami percaya, SAF bukan sekadar produk, melainkan simbol kesiapan Indonesia memimpin transisi energi di sektor aviasi. Dengan dukungan infrastruktur dan pengalaman Pertamina, SAF diharapkan membuka jalan menuju masa depan yang lebih hijau,” tutup Harsono.

SAF Pertamina saat ini telah memperoleh sertifikasi ISCC CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) dan ISCC EU (Renewable Energy Directive-European Union), yang menjadikan Pertamina Patra Niaga dapat memasarkan produk berkelanjutan sesuai ketentuan CORSIA dan RED EU.
