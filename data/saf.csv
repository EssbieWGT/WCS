(Worley Consulting/Biofuels International) ... Without urgent action to develop supplies of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), emissions could reach 21.2 metric gigatonnes a year. However, with SAF supply still in its early stages and the window to meet these targets narrowing, there is growing pressure on the industry to accelerate SAF adoption now.

New investment

While investment and interest are growing, the global SAF rollout remains in its infancy. Projects currently in advanced development are expected to meet just 2 to 4% of global jet fuel demand by 2030. Today, SAF supply accounts for only 0.1% of all aviation fuel use.

To ensure success, SAF supply must scale up, and airlines must act swiftly in securing SAF contracts and collaborating with the right technical and strategic experts, as well as the appropriate project developers deploying the correct technology pathway with the right feedstock.

For aviation to meet its net-zero targets, developers and financiers must commit to projects built on access to sustainable feedstocks and renewable energy.

Biofuels International spoke with Nicola Knight, Director of Low Carbon at Worley Consulting, about the short runway for SAF’s transition to mainstream fuel.

How is the Low Carbon team at Worley Consulting involved in the SAF sector?

The focus of the Low Carbon team is to help industrial customers modify their businesses to manage emissions, meet sustainability targets, and align with evolving regulations.

Where customers have existing facilities, we help shape decarbonisation roadmaps using a greenhouse gas mitigation hierarchy – starting with energy efficiency, progressing to low-carbon hydrogen fuel switching, electrification, carbon capture, and nature-based solutions.

For customers with a bioethanol or SAF plan, we advise on business sustainability. That includes assessing feedstock sustainability, identifying the strongest business case, and exploring the best funding options – such as the EU’s Innovation Fund or the Inflation Reduction Act in the US.

Our integrated expertise across technical, commercial, and regulatory landscapes helps customers de-risk and strengthen their investment decisions.

How is the SAF sector maturing, and what trends have you noticed?

...

There is a lot of interest in eSAF, and we have been helping customers scale the technology, but today its production costs can be as much as ten times higher than fossil-derived aviation fuel.

...

Will there be enough low-carbon electricity supply for eSAF to go mainstream?

Access to affordable, low carbon-intensity electricity is critical. Without it, SAF may not reach a price point the market can widely adopt.

...

It is essential that projects ensure sustainable feedstock and access to water (if hydrogen production from electrolysis is required).

A fuel producer must understand the food situation of the country being considered as a production base.

To be sustainable, SAF must be produced from feedstocks that do not compete with food supply or compromise land use.

That means sourcing residues from food crops or using non-arable land that cannot support food crops.

It is also vital to assess local water availability, especially in agriculturally dependent or drought-prone areas. Feedstock sustainability is key – without it, SAF cannot be considered sustainable.",https://advancedbiofuelsusa.info/assets/images/Advanced-Biofuels-Logo.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 20:02:21.865955

RINS PROPOSAL The RFS proposal also calls for a 50% reduction in the number of renewable identification numbers, or RINs, generated for imported renewable fuels and those fuels produced with foreign feedstocks.
""The significant increase in proposed volumes for biomass-based diesel will support soybean farmers, soybean processors and biofuel producers in rural America, and serves as a much-needed win for our communities,"" he said in a statement.
Geoff Cooper, CEO and president of the Renewable Fuels Association, said the proposal was a good first step for biofuels producers and farmers.
Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association said in a statement, ""Agriculture is hurting, having just endured the largest two-year drop in net farm income in history.","LINCOLN, Neb. (DTN) -- The Trump administration proposed a record 24.02 billion gallons of biofuels be blended in 2026, with biomass-based diesel seeing a more than 2-billion-gallon jump from 2025 to 5.61 billion gallons in 2026, in a Renewable Fuel Standard proposal released Friday.

Biomass-based diesel was the big story as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposal also calls for another bump in 2027 to 5.86 billion gallons.

July soybeans closed Friday up 27 1/2 cents at $10.69 3/4 based on the news. November soybeans also ended the day higher by the same margin at $10.54 3/4. July soybean oil closed up the daily limit of 3 cents a pound at 50.61 cents per pound. July corn ended the day up 6 cents at $4.44 1/2.

""Definitely a welcomed event after months of uncertainty for the biofuel industry and by extension the ag industry,"" DTN Lead Analyst Rhett Montgomery said.

""It's felt for a while that federal guidance for biofuels was the missing demand piece, especially in the soybean oil market where exports are already very impressive and the newly announced RVOs as well as domestic protections for U.S. feedstocks just solidifies the demand for soybean oil amid fairly tight stocks. Soybean crush also continues at a record pace and is forecasted to set another record again in 2025-26, which is certainly hard to argue at this point given Friday's news.""

The much-anticipated proposal would keep conventional corn-based ethanol at 15 billion gallons during the next two years.

The Trump administration's proposal is a significant step up compared to the Biden administration's multi-year rule that set biomass-based diesel volumes at 3.35 billion gallons in 2025. The industry has been calling for much higher RFS volumes to match actual production, at a time when biodiesel plants have been cutting back or closing production in light of lingering tax uncertainty.

RINS PROPOSAL

The RFS proposal also calls for a 50% reduction in the number of renewable identification numbers, or RINs, generated for imported renewable fuels and those fuels produced with foreign feedstocks.

Devin Mogler, president and CEO of the National Oilseed Processors Association, said that aspect of the proposal is important.

""We applaud the administration for recognizing the need to reduce the RIN value for biofuels made from imports of tallow and so-called 'used cooking oil' which have been displacing U.S. soybean oil -- harming farmers and biofuel producers alike for years,"" Mogler said in a statement.

Caleb Ragland, president of the American Soybean Association and a famer from Magnolia, Kentucky, said the proposal is a boost to rural America.

""The significant increase in proposed volumes for biomass-based diesel will support soybean farmers, soybean processors and biofuel producers in rural America, and serves as a much-needed win for our communities,"" he said in a statement.

Kurt Kovarik, vice president of federal affairs for Clean Fuels Alliance America, said the proposal was a ""welcome and timely signal"" to U.S. biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel producers as well as America's farmers and agricultural businesses.

""The industry has made major investments in domestic production capacity and feedstocks to meet America's energy needs and provide consumers affordable, cleaner fuels,"" he said in a statement.

""We anticipate this will have a tremendous beneficial impact for American farmers and agricultural communities and we look forward to working with President Trump and EPA Administrator Zeldin to finalize this rule and fully unleash U.S. clean fuel producers.""

SMALL-REFINERY EXEMPTIONS

On small-refinery exemptions, the EPA offered an evaluation of where things stand.

EPA said the total volumes requirements remain the same regardless of SREs but the percentage obligations for non-exempt obligated parties increase when SREs are granted. So, the volume obligations would be achieved by fewer obligated parties.

""There is currently significant uncertainty regarding the number of small-refinery exemption petitions that could be granted for 2026 and 2027,"" the agency said in the proposal.

""We have yet to take further action on these petitions and are still determining how we will evaluate and decide those petitions, which would then inform how we would evaluate and decide any SRE petitions received for 2026 and 2027. We expect to communicate our policy regarding SRE petitions going forward before finalization of this rule.""

EPA provides a range of potential gallons exempted for 2026 and 2027 from what it says are about 34 qualifying and operational small refineries that produce about 18 billion gallons of gasoline and diesel. To qualify for exemptions, the RFS requires small refineries to show disproportionate harm from having to meet their obligations.

Geoff Cooper, CEO and president of the Renewable Fuels Association, said the proposal was a good first step for biofuels producers and farmers.

""It represents an excellent starting point for the 2026 and 2027 RVO discussion,"" Cooper said in a statement.

""The entire supply chain is seeking certainty regarding EPA's plans on SREs and today's proposal helps to clarify the agency's approach moving forward. We agree that the agency has a legal obligation to reallocate any exempted blending volumes, consistent with the approach adopted by EPA near the end of President Trump's first administration. However, EPA's top priority for SREs should be maintaining a high standard for evaluating petitions and continuing to take a restrained and limited approach. The marketplace needs to be reassured that the RVOs published by EPA are real and will not be watered down or eroded by SREs.""

American Coalition for Ethanol CEO Brian Jennings said the ""stakes are high"" for this next phase of the RFS.

""Ethanol producers and farmers are under tremendous economic pressure, particularly due to uncertainty caused by current efforts to reorder international trade and we need EPA to substantially increase domestic ethanol blending under the RFS in 2026 and 2027,"" Jennings said. ""This rulemaking is a pivotal opportunity for the Trump administration to fully utilize the RFS statutory authorities by setting ambitious blending targets that reflect the critical role American ethanol plays in strengthening U.S. energy security, boosting rural economies and reducing prices at the pump.""

Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor said the proposal is a boost the industry needed.

""Today's proposed RVOs secure an economic lifeline for the nation's farmers and ethanol producers,"" she said in a statement.

""EPA's proposal will unlock investments, create jobs and support growth in rural America, expanding renewable fuel production and creating the kind of certainty that spurs innovation and truly unleashes American energy dominance. Although EPA has yet to project future SREs, we expect that it will ensure that any lost gallons from exemptions will be reallocated to ensure that blending obligations are met.""

Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association said in a statement, ""Agriculture is hurting, having just endured the largest two-year drop in net farm income in history. We need forward-leaning RFS blending levels to maximize American energy dominance. Midwest farmers are ready to help power our economy.""

Republican Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley said the proposed biodiesel volumes would help the industry rebound from when ""under the Biden administration, five biodiesel plants in Iowa closed or idled in part because RVOs were set too low.""

Abstract

Low carbon fuel policies such as the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), Canada Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR), and California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) as well as the 45Z tax credit are intended to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation. Cellulosic feedstocks, optimized biorefineries, and favorable farming locations can significantly reduce biofuel carbon intensity (CI). Despite advances in field-to-fuel GHG monitoring and flexibility in resource allocation within biorefineries (e.g., governing net electricity production), rigid CI accounting procedures in current policies may limit CI responsiveness across candidate sites and processing facilities. This work examines a hypothetical biomass-to-sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pathway using miscanthus and alcohol-to-jet (i) to demonstrate how GHG accounting requirements drive estimates of biofuel CIs and (ii) to explore potential CI and financial implications of scenario-specific life cycle assessment (LCA). Results demonstrate GHG accounting using the CFR/LCFS can reasonably account for distinct levels of net electricity production by a biorefinery, but only the CFR yields similar CI sensitivity to spatially explicit factors (feedstock CI, grid electricity CI) as scenario-specific LCA: most GHG accounting frameworks do not capture CI variation across candidate sites in the United States. Ultimately, this work demonstrates the importance of LCA methodological specifications in low carbon fuel policies and tax credits.

Representative Rick Larsen and Senator Jerry Moran receive 2025 GBTA Navigator Awards for championing business travel in the U.S.

Alexandria, VA – More than 100 members and constituents of the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) converged this week in Washington, D.C. for the GBTA U.S. Legislative Summit 2025 with the collective purpose of advocating for the vital role and value of business travel. Through direct meetings with Senators, Representatives and congressional staff, members from GBTA’s 38 U.S. chapters shared insights and championed policies to advance business travel’s impact as an economic driver and to create a more connected and resilient travel ecosystem.

Held June 10-12, the Summit provided industry professionals with the opportunity to network, learn, and engage directly with legislators to underscore the value of business travel in the U.S. economy. GBTA also advocated for streamlined international travel including policies that enhance the traveler experience and restore confidence in U.S. entry processes. GBTA participants also discussed the need to modernize the U.S. air traffic system, support Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and improve passenger rail to provide viable travel alternatives.

For more than two decades, GBTA has hosted legislative fly-ins to connect business travel experts with U.S. policymakers to foster understanding, advocate for priority issues and facilitate a better experience for business travelers. By promoting the strategic role of business travel in driving economies, innovation, jobs and strategic collaboration, we foster a more resilient future for business travelers and those who support them. Suzanne Neufang, CEO, GBTA

Setting the Policy Agenda for Business Travel

Summit attendees heard perspectives directly from members of Congress including Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nevada) and Rep. Rick Larsen (D-Washington), as well as from various experts on critical topics including air traffic system modernization, the evolution of SAF and improving U.S. passenger rail travel.

In close to 150 meetings with legislators, attendees shared GBTA’s policy priorities for U.S. business travel. Based on these priorities, GBTA constituents asked legislators to:

Support the modernization of the air traffic system

Improve business travel at U.S. borders

Support funding for the hiring of 5,000 additional Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers

Reject efforts to extend the diversion of the 9/11 Passenger Security Fe

Support additional resources for CBP’s implementation of the Entry and Exit Program in order to accelerate the safe facilitation of business travelers at the nation’s points of entry

Support the inclusion of the extension of the Clean Fuel Production Credit (45Z) through 2031

Support future funding for U.S. rail improvements

Summit attendees also shared with Congressional members key takeaways from the “GBTA U.S. Economic Impact Study: Business Travel’s Impact on Jobs and the U.S. Economy” outlining how U.S. business travel contributes $484.4 billion annually, or 1.9% of the U.S. gross domestic product. They also showcased GBTA’s recent poll results reflecting industry concern about the potential negative impact of U.S. government actions on business travel.

GBTA Recognizes U.S. Legislators for Championing Business Travel

GBTA announced Rep. Rick Larsen (D-Washington) and Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) as the 2025 recipients of its prestigious “GBTA Navigator Award.” The award is presented to elected officials who have been strong advocates for issues integral to the business travel industry and recognizes them for championing the needs of business travelers and the broader travel sector.

Rep. Larsen is the Ranking Member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and in his role, he has advocated for safety and efficiency for aviation. Last year, he worked in a bipartisan fashion to pass the Federal Aviation Administration Re-Authorization Bill, which included several GBTA-supported priorities such as safety improvements to the National Airspace System, studies to improve accessibility concerns, and workforce investments to train more pilots and air traffic controllers. This year, Rep. Larsen has worked with the Department of Transportation to make improvements to our nation’s air traffic control system, strategically enhance the workforce for long-term success, and foster innovation to improve aviation safety.

Sen. Moran has championed increasing the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Late last year he formed the bipartisan SAF Caucus to find ways to promote technologically innovative solutions to create a sustainable aviation industry and increase U.S. competitiveness in the domestic production of SAF. Sen. Moran is actively involved in promoting aviation safety through legislative efforts and oversight of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). He has championed bills to improve aviation safety, including the NOTAM Improvement Act, and has pushed FAA leadership on safety system failures and progress in implementing improvements.

The GBTA U.S. Legislative Summit is the only event in the U.S. that advocates for legislation to make the business travel industry better. This year’s Summit was made possible by Altour, BWH Hotels, Cornerstone, Delta Airlines, Enterprise Mobility, CIBT, United Airlines and USiLAW.

“The pace at which we are approaching sustainability is incredible, and establishes business aviation as a leader in this space.”","Among business aviation companies, Gulfstream Aerospace is at the sustainability forefront. In addition to designing increasingly efficient business jets – its current fleet features fuel-efficiency gains of up to 33% over previous models – the company has implemented a series of initiatives to lower the environmental impact of its business operations during the past decade.

When, in 2024, the company wanted to get even more aggressive about sustainability, it needed just the right person to lead the charge in the new role of chief sustainability officer. The person Gulfstream hired was Smitha Hariharan.

Accelerating Progress in Business Aviation Sustainability

Gulfstream brought Hariharan on board to help accelerate the company’s progress towards industry and internal goals, which include meeting General Dynamics’ goals of reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon dioxide emissions by 40% by 2034, relative to 2019.

Biography of a Sustainability Leader

At the start of her career, Hariharan – who holds a Master of Science in Engineering Management from Missouri University of Science and Technology and a Master of Business Administration from Yale – worked in onshore and offshore oil and gas exploration. Next, she joined Halliburton, working in operations management, product management and business development, before becoming head of sustainability at Halliburton Energy Services.

Beyond the experiences and abilities detailed in her C.V., though, what made Hariharan stand out most to Gulfstream was the passion she brings to her work.

“You have to have a passion for sustainability, along with a clear understanding of sustainability principles,” she said, explaining how she progressed to her current leadership role.

Inside Gulfstream’s Sustainability Strategy

Using sustainable aviation fuel to lower flight operations emissions is central to Gulfstream’s sustainability strategy. The company is also creating more sustainable operations on the ground. Its newer facilities boast energy-saving features including recycled building materials, energy-efficient lighting, radiant heating systems, advanced HVAC control systems for heating and cooling, rainwater harvesting and preferred parking for low-emission automobiles.

That’s all great – but it’s not enough for Hariharan.

“All of these areas need to be more environmentally sustainable,” she said.

For her, ensuring that business goals and sustainability goals are mutually supportive is key to making meaningful progress. Doing sustainability right means really, deeply understanding how your business creates value – and how sustainability programs can accelerate value creation.

“Laying down the right framework for your company and where it is on the sustainability journey requires clear thinking, identifying priorities and understanding the role your organization plays in the business aviation value chain,” she explained.

Partnering With CLIMBING. FAST. to Drive Business Aviation Sustainability

As part of its effort to lead in sustainability, Gulfstream is partnering with CLIMBING. FAST., an advocacy campaign showcasing business aviation’s many benefits to society, from creating opportunities for today’s workforce to spearheading the drive to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The campaign highlights business aviation sustainability leaders, innovations, and milestones, in addition to the industry’s value to citizens, businesses and communities.

According to Hariharan, CLIMBING. FAST. effectively communicates the shared goals of business aviation companies and the industry’s significant sustainability achievements, while also identifying ways the industry can collaborate to lower emissions and reduce waste. Based on her work at Gulfstream and things like the company’s partnership with CLIMBING. FAST., she is optimistic about progress toward sustainability in business aviation.

“I am so glad to be a part of this company and this industry at this time,” Hariharan said. “The pace at which we are approaching sustainability is incredible, and establishes business aviation as a leader in this space.”",https://climbingfast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/d_g700_a_newsroom_00121.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 17:01:42.166945

New Aircraft Engines Run At Cooler Temperatures While newer aircraft have promised to run with lower carbon emissions, their engines run at cooler temperatures when compared to older generation aircraft.","It's no secret that the world is facing a climate crisis, and that businesses are looking at ways to limit their carbon footprint, in a bid to help lower greenhouse gas emissions amid the harsh reality of climate change. However, some researchers believe that newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft could be contributing more to global warming than older series aircraft. Around 65% of jets cruise at altitudes between 30,000 to 39,000 feet, a prime location for aircraft contrails to occur.

The aviation industry is under immense pressure to reduce its current carbon footprint, which has seen airlines and their aircraft manufacturers invest billions into fuel-efficient aircraft, which are promised to have less fuel burn, and as a result, emit far less greenhouse gases per passenger mile. The Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 are the poster children for such initiatives, with promises to help reduce operating costs and lower emissions that he airline may attempt to offset.

Contributing More, Not Less

Recent research has identified that modern aircraft could inadvertently be adding more to global warming than older, less efficient aircraft. This is not due to their carbon emissions, but due to the contrail-induced cirrus clouds that the aircraft produce. The aviation industry has previously set lofty ambitions for environmental targets, promising to reduce emissions without fully discovering the technology required to hit these goals. Some carriers have set a 2050 date to cut their emissions footprint completely. However, the majority of this has so far been done by using recycled oils, carbon offsets, and adjusting their onboard offerings to limit waste.

Contrail-induced cirrus clouds are high-altitude clouds that are composed of ice crystals, produced from the condensation of freezing water vapor that comes from an aircraft's exhaust. These clouds result in contrails that spread out and evolve into cirrus clouds in unique climatic conditions.

The formation is done by water vapor that is present in the aircraft's exhaust, which mixes with cold, humid air and freezes into crystals. The contrails are the visible streaks that people below can spot in the clouds, which are left behind the airplane. These are seen when aircraft are flying at very high altitudes. Around 10% of all contrail production, known as persistent contrails, can remain for hours after the flight has passed. Aircraft fly at high altitudes such as 30,000 to 39,000 feet, as this is where the air is thin, but also where the air is more humid, resulting in contrails.

Impact On The World's Climate

Both contrail cirrus and natural cirrus trails are composed of ice crystals and have radiative effects on our world's climate. This is due to the impact on the quantity of sunlight that can reach the Earth's surface versus how much heat is trapped in the atmosphere. If the air is humid and cold enough, there are conditions where contrails can remain for hours, and even days, and slowly spread out, creating contrail cirrus.

Unlike CO2, contrails have a short but intense warming effect on Earth due to them trapping heat in the atmosphere, and on some occasions reflecting light into space. This results in a net effect of warming, and it is estimated that contrails can contribute significantly to global warming.

While contrails usually dissipate quickly, in some conditions they will remain for hours, and if this continues, they can spread into cirrus clouds, which are high, thin, wispy clouds formed of ice crystals. While more fuel-efficient jets, like the Dreamliner and Airbus A350, have been commended for lower CO2 emissions when compared to older generation aircraft, research reveals the paradox that they may be contributing more to global warming than previously thought.

New Aircraft Engines Run At Cooler Temperatures

While newer aircraft have promised to run with lower carbon emissions, their engines run at cooler temperatures when compared to older generation aircraft. This results in more water vapor being produced at high altitudes, which is a key contributor to persistent contrails.

This is where the industry is sitting on a knife-edge, as while newer planes can promise lower CO2 emissions, they may produce more contrails than older aircraft. Some researchers suggest, however, that persistent contrails could outweigh CO2 savings in the short term. Flights operating at night, which are usually in cooler temperatures, are the prime ingredient for contrail production, meaning that in the darkness of night, it is the worst time for contrails to happen.

Contrail-induced cirrus clouds do have the possibility to contribute to a greater immediate warming effect when compared to carbon emissions; however, as a short-term, but potent contributor, it has to be weighed up against CO2, for which aviation accounts for almost 2.5% of global emissions. As reported by PHYS.ORG, airlines are now admitting that the production of contrails at high altitudes could be a factor in global warming, and airlines such as American, and Southwest Airlines, are now looking at how and when these contrails are at their most harmful to the environment, and what can be done to reduce them.

How To Fix The Problem?

While there is no quick fix to the problem, there are a few adjustments that can be made to lower contrail formation. Avoiding humid air layers is the first step. If planes fly with small altitude changes, this could reduce the contrail warming by up to 50%, with minimal effect on the operating cost of the flight (i.e., fuel burn).

Sustainable aviation fuel (also known as SAF) has the chance to burn cleaner, which, as a result, reduces both CO2 and the contrail risk. With hydrogen power aircraft currently in development, this may eventually see the chance of contrails being eliminated in their entirety. Potential solutions outlined below:

This is a complicated trade-off, with the solution being that there needs to be a balance of CO2 emission cuts, with developed contrail mitigation. This can be done by using newer, engineered, smarter new flight paths, and the adoption of cleaner, more sustainable fuel. Without the industry looking to address both issues, the climate progress within aviation could be undermined by this warming effect.

A Study Fears Rerouting Flights Could Lead To More Climate Warming

A study by the University of Reading and Sorbonne Université looked at the formation of contrails above the North Atlantic and feared that rerouting flights to avoid contrail creation could also inadvertently add to climate warming. The researchers found that for flights that form contrails, the benefit of avoiding this airspace would outweigh the extra carbon emitted if flying a different route.

These findings identify that regardless of contrail avoidance, it will result in increased CO2 emissions. The study looked at over half a million flights in 2019, and the carbon dioxide emissions from these flights, as well as the contrails that were formed.

Co-author of the study, Professor Nicholas Bellouin, from the University of Reading, shared his findings, which stated: “Rerouting flights to avoid contrails could in theory reduce the climate impact of aviation and make air travel more sustainable. Our findings lift a major obstacle against implementing contrail avoidance, but we now need better forecasting and real-world trials to make this work in practice.""

A Tough Decision To Make

To decide a path forward means a tough decision for airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and regulators, which is either to focus on reducing CO2 emissions, and risk the short-term warming of the earth, by acting on smarter flights, operating with new, sustainable, cleaner fuels, with better regulations and policy. Carbon offset programs, which many airlines offer their passengers the opportunity to contribute, could in addition include contrail mitigations. The existence of contrails could be more damaging over the next two decades than carbon emissions. However, solutions do exist, as we have already explained.

Transparency from airlines and supported research into contrail mitigation, needs to see regulations that will cover all climate impacts, that are not just limited to CO2. Without action, this once invisible threat could completely unravel the industry's progress to lower carbon emissions from the growing demand of aviation and air travel.

The industry needs to find a new balance of how to manage CO2 reduction, alongside contrail mitigation. Fuel efficiency is critical not just for airline operations but also for long-term decarbonization of the aviation industry. Immediate action needs to be taken through research into cleaner fuels and smarter flight paths that can limit the effects of contrails. This will allow the industry to continue developing and becoming more sustainable, without the adverse effects of global warming.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/how-more-fuel-efficient-aircraft-are-linked-to-global-warming.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 15:56:52.895712

They have a 100-square-meter stand to showcase innovations in agriculture, climate, energy, artificial intelligence, and health (read more at: agencia.fapesp.br/54959).

The program at the stand also includes USP professors who, besides being available to investors, entrepreneurs, and visitors to the fair, are participating in roundtable discussions to present technologies developed by their centers of excellence.

One of the round tables was themed “Science and Innovation for a Sustainable Future: USP Advances in Climate, AI, Clean Energy, Health, and Technology,” and featured the following speakers: Julio Meneghini, Paulo Artaxo, Carlos Labate, Marcelo Zuffo, Fabio Cozman, and Vanderlei Bagnato.

Meneghini discussed some of the projects and innovations presented at VivaTech by the Research Center for Greenhouse Gas Innovation (RCGI), a research center based at the Engineering School (POLI-USP) and funded by Shell and FAPESP. The RCGI was responsible for organizing the institutional participation of USP and FAPESP in the Paris event, including stand design, technology curation, and activity programming.

“We brought some examples of innovations produced at the RCGI, such as startups involved in green methanol production, solar-powered hydrogen production, solid oxide fuel cells, and ethanol-powered electricity generation. We’re also presenting a system that uses virtual reality to produce a multisensory experience simulating the Amazon Rainforest with visual, auditory, and olfactory stimuli,” he said.

“The RCGI is celebrating its tenth anniversary, and it’s very satisfying to see the results of important projects developed during this period by the approximately 600 researchers who are part of the project. Our center was created with support from FAPESP under the Engineering Research Centers/Applied Research Centers Program, and our mission is to become a globally recognized center of excellence that contributes to a sustainable future and helps Brazil meet its climate goals established in the Paris Agreement,” said Meneghini.

The RCGI’s executive and scientific director emphasized that the focus is on producing practical solutions based on solid science. One of the programs mentioned was Greenhouse Gases, with projects aimed, for example, at reducing leaks of methane – one of the most potent greenhouse gases – in industrial processes.

“Another RCGI program is Nature-Based Solutions, through which we seek to develop new technologies applicable to agriculture and livestock, making these sectors more sustainable,” said Meneghini.

“At the RCGI, we also have a cross-cutting project that seeks to focus the center’s internationalization efforts, as we believe that Brazil can lead the next great challenge of this century: making progress happen in a sustainable way,” he said.

Paulo Artaxo presented a project aimed at building a greenhouse gas emissions database for the Amazon region, which is also being conducted at the RCGI. The platform is being built using big data techniques to generate information that will enable the monitoring of emissions, a more accurate understanding of their causes, and support for the formulation of public policies aimed at mitigating these gases.

“Initially focused on the Amazon, the project is now being expanded to all of South America. Among the main features of the platform are a harmonized database and a user-friendly interface. All of this provides a solid scientific basis for decision makers to act more safely and effectively,” said Artaxo.

Cerrado solution

Carlos Labate, coordinator of the Multi-user Proteomics, Metabolomics, and Lipidomics Laboratory at the Luiz de Queiroz School of Agriculture (ESALQ-USP), gave a presentation on macaúba as a promising crop for sustainable development. In partnership with Acelen Renováveis, ESALQ-USP researchers are developing a project to produce biofuels from macaúba, a plant native to the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna-like biome) that has not yet been domesticated.

“Macaúba stands out for its extremely high oil productivity – it produces seven to ten times more oil than soybeans – and it’s important to note that it isn’t a food crop, meaning it doesn’t compete with crops such as soybeans or corn. This eliminates one of the main criticisms of using agricultural land for biofuel production: we aren’t taking space away from food production,” said Labate.

The goal of the project is to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel. According to the professor, Brazil has a significant amount of land with agricultural potential, and macaúba is a sustainable way to utilize it. “Managing macaúba using degraded pastures won’t encourage deforestation or negatively impact land use,” he said.

The ESALQ-USP professor explained that they are studying three species of macaúba: Acrocomia aculeata, distributed mainly in the states of Bahia and Minas Gerais and in the southern region of the state of Mato Grosso; Acrocomia totai, present in the states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul; and Acrocomia intumescens, found mainly in the Northeast region of Brazil. “This diversity represents multiple opportunities for regional development, with species adapted to different environments, from the coast to the interior of the country. We’ve already sequenced the genome of A. aculeata and are finalizing the sequencing of A. totai. This work is fundamental for the genetic improvement of the plant,” he said.

The researchers are building a germplasm bank using samples collected from different regions. These samples show genetic variability in characteristics such as fruit size and quantity, which are essential factors for developing more productive varieties.

A trillion computers

The goal of the project presented by Marcelo Zuffo, coordinator of the Interdisciplinary Center for Interactive Technologies at USP, is to develop a real-time perception of the Amazon Rainforest through a new type of artificial intelligence.

“Our main challenge is to build a persistent perception of the biodiversity of the rainforest – a perception that’s accurate, direct, continuous, and long-lasting. It’s important to remember that many trees in tropical forests live for centuries, while most electronic devices today don’t even last a few decades,” he said.

The project, called Farm AI, proposes developing autonomous devices equipped with carbon dioxide, temperature, infrared, and other sensors. These sensors must operate safely, efficiently, and autonomously in remote environments. The researchers are also using technologies such as blockchain and encryption to ensure the security, traceability, and integrity of the data collected.

“What’s our vision? A trillion computers. We work with the concept of dust computing. Imagine computational grains of sand scattered throughout the Amazon – a simple handful of this sand containing billions of grains, each capable of processing data, communicating, and collaborating with others,” said Zuffo.

The researcher commented that the next big technological wave may be in such devices, which are embedded everywhere and capable of interacting, collaborating, and replicating themselves. “Intelligent devices interacting organically, creating a distributed collective intelligence – for example, a collective organic intelligence of the forest – leading to an internet of trees,” he said.

“We already have working prototypes. The idea is to create a swarm of robust, very low-cost devices with environmental sensor applications. We’ve already conducted the first tests, with ten devices launched in the forest, and we plan to produce 2,000 units,” he said.

Zuffo explains that each device is coin-sized and contains a 2 x 3 millimeter chip with 300 million transistors. “It’s a complete computer capable of running AI and encryption, and can connect to more than 200 different sensors,” he said.

Preserving Indigenous languages

For decades, USP has been a national reference in artificial intelligence research, conducting studies in various fields and units, including medicine, engineering, computer science, and social sciences. To consolidate this work, the Center for Artificial Intelligence (C4AI) was created as a partnership between USP, FAPESP, and IBM. The center brings together about 90 professors from various fields, explained Fabio Cozman, the director of the center.

“At the C4AI, we investigate everything from AI algorithms to their practical applications in sectors such as health, law, public policy, agribusiness, and natural language processing, with an emphasis on the Portuguese language,” said Cozman, who highlighted two C4AI projects focused on sustainability, which was the theme of the session at VivaTech.

“In the first, the idea is to predict extreme events in the South Atlantic, particularly studying storm surges, which cause flooding due to tides and winds rather than rain. The project uses a machine learning approach based on physical models that integrates ocean data with environmental modeling, in collaboration with researchers in engineering and marine sciences,” he said.

“The second project focuses on preserving Brazilian indigenous languages to ensure their continuity among new generations. The challenge lies in developing translation tools for Brazil’s indigenous languages. The country has more than 200 languages besides Portuguese. The proposal is to create applications and tools that help young people learn and become familiar with their language and their ancestral language,” said Cozman.

Photonics against bacterial resistance

“At the University of São Paulo, we work with three fundamental principles: doing science with excellence; doing science with relevance – that is, solving problems, especially with social responsibility; and third, being international. We don’t produce knowledge just for ourselves, but for humanity. That’s what we’re proud of,” said Vanderlei Bagnato, coordinator of the Optics and Photonics Research Center (CePOF) at the São Carlos Institute of Physics (IFSC-USP).

“In São Carlos, we have about 120 people working. We started as a center funded by FAPESP, and today we’re also part of a federal government program, with projects co-funded by companies. We currently have around 90 projects with the private sector – 60 already completed and 30 in progress. Our team is multidisciplinary: physicists, doctors, pharmacists, mathematicians – we work with technology development and instrumentation, from quantum physics to healthcare,” he explained.

“We work in human, environmental, and animal health, facing three major challenges. The first is cancer treatment. Despite advances in knowledge, access to treatment is still very limited – even in rich countries, the costs are extremely high. The second challenge is chronic diseases such as Parkinson’s, diabetes, fibromyalgia, and arthritis, which affect millions of people and require new protocols and equipment to improve patients’ quality of life,” said Bagnato.

“The third major challenge is infections, especially given the bacterial resistance to antibiotics. We’re developing an innovative treatment for resistant pneumonia: we’ve created inhalable molecules that attach themselves to the lungs at the site of infection and are activated by infrared light. This generates free radicals that destroy the bacterial colony or make the bacteria sensitive to antibiotics again,” said the CePOF coordinator.

“We’re already in phase 3 of clinical trials for this treatment. In Texas, we’re developing animal models of pneumonia in sheep and dogs – species that naturally develop the disease. We hope to begin clinical trials in humans next year. This approach could be a game changer because 10 to 15 million people die from resistant pneumonia each year, not due to a lack of doctors, but due to a lack of effective drugs,” said Bagnato. He is partnering with Texas A&M University to establish a CePOF-style center in the United States with funding from the State of Texas.",https://mediasvc.eurekalert.org/Api/v1/Multimedia/5a886106-657b-40ac-9552-9c36c5cc25c2/Rendition/thumbnail/Content/Public,N,,2025-06-13 15:56:58.245272

Speaking at a closed-door event with business partners on April 22, 2025, Rhenus Indonesia presented a comprehensive suite of services aimed at improving carbon management, reporting transparency, and emissions reduction across multiple transport modes. The offerings come as global regulations such as the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), and Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) place mounting pressure on supply chains to decarbonize. Indonesia is also developing its own carbon pricing frameworks and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) roadmap to meet its Net Zero Emissions target by 2060.

Key elements of Rhenus’ sustainable logistics portfolio include:

Emissions Reporting & Monitoring: Emissions dashboards allow businesses to track CO₂ output across air, sea, and land transport. Partnering with EcotransIT, Rhenus helps optimize energy use and calculate freight emissions across multimodal supply chains.

Sustainable Aviation Solutions: Initiatives such as Rhegreen optimize aircraft selection for minimal emissions, while SAF insetting programs and Clean Cargo collaborations offer scalable decarbonization pathways.

Sustainable Shipping & Overland Transport: The Transport Mode Optimizer tool supports sustainable routing decisions, while investments in alternative drive vehicles—including electric trucks, CNG, LNG, and biodiesel fleets—reduce overland transport emissions.

Sustainable Facilities: Rhenus is integrating eco-friendly designs across multiple Indonesian sites, including photovoltaic power systems, rainwater utilization, and energy-efficient infrastructure.

With operations in Indonesia for over a decade, Rhenus supports industries ranging from automotive and healthcare to industrial and consumer sectors, operating from six locations across Java, Sumatra, and Batam.

“At Rhenus, sustainability is not an afterthought—it’s a core principle shaping how we build and operate supply chains,” said Fabian Kieble, Managing Director, Rhenus Indonesia. “From transparent emission reporting to cleaner transport solutions, our goal is to drive meaningful change across the logistics sector.”

Rhenus’ expanded sustainability offering reflects the growing urgency for logistics providers in emerging markets to align with global emissions frameworks while supporting local businesses facing new compliance obligations. As Indonesia positions itself to play a greater role in the sustainable fuel market and tightens carbon reporting standards, third-party logistics providers (3PLs) like Rhenus are increasingly serving as both compliance partners and operational advisors. The firm’s adoption of SAF insetting, multimodal optimization tools, and alternative fuel vehicles signals a proactive stance toward decarbonization, while its strong ISO certification portfolio reinforces its credentials for multinational clients navigating Scope 3 emissions reporting under EU and international sustainability mandates.",https://logistics-manager.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/dghsrthwrthwrth.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 12:56:35.588661

Friday, June 13th, 2025

The geopolitical risk premium is back, with Israel’s strikes on Iran bringing ICE Brent futures to $75 per barrel in a world where OPEC+ continues to unwind its production cuts and global demand is decelerating due to Donald Trump’s tariff wars. Whilst oil infrastructure was not damaged in Israel’s strikes, the anticipation of Iran’s retaliation is already sending ripples across the oil industry, with the Red Sea becoming a target again and Israel’s gas fields pre-emptively halting production ahead of the weekend.

Israel’s Attack on Iran Marks Largest Daily Jump in Three Years. Israel’s attack on Iran sent crude prices to their highest in five months, stoking fears that further escalation would impede navigation through the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway transiting a fifth of global oil consumption, some 19 million b/d of crude and products.

Egypt Clinches Monster LNG Deal. The government of Egypt has reached agreements with global traders Saudi Aramco, Trafigura, Vitol and Shell for up to 160 cargoes of LNG, covering the needs of the North African country for H2 2025 and next year, with premiums of $0.70-0.75 per mmBtu above TTF.

Canada Plans New Pipeline to the Pacific. Alberta Premier Danielle Smith will be proposing a new crude pipeline route from Alberta to the Port of Prince Rupert in British Columbia to the Canadian government, currently gauging private companies’ appetite for the mulled 1 million b/d conduit.

Guyana to Mark First Oil From Yellowtail Soon. US oil major ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) expects to load its first oil cargo the Guyana’s fourth production unit in August-September, with the grade produced at the Yellowtail and Redtail fields called ‘Golden Arrowhead’ and being lighter than other Guyanese grades.

India Imports Record Russian Crude Oil. India is poised to hit a new all-time high after ratcheting up imports of Russian crude, importing over 2.2 million b/d in the first two weeks of June, equivalent to 46% of the South Asian country’s total needs, as Russian grades still trade below the price cap.

ADNOC Mulls Takeover Targets. ADNOC, the national oil company of the UAE, is reportedly mulling the potential acquisition of Australia’s upstream firm Santos (ASX:STO) whilst concurrently looking at BP’s (NYSE:BP) natural gas assets, some of which might be up for grabs as the UK major deleverages.

Algeria Has Had Enough of Being a Producer. Following the path charted by Middle Eastern national oil companies, Algeria has allocated $7 billion in refinery investments for the next five years, including a new refinery in Hassi Messaoud, a new naphtha cracker in Arzew and a new fuel oil cracking unit in Skikda.

EPA Disappoints US Biodiesel Producers. The US Environmental Protection Agency is widely expected to propose lower-than-expected biofuel blending requirements for 2026 and 2027, rejecting the 5.25-billion-gallon demand of biodiesel producers, a huge jump from this year’s 5.25 billion gallons.

The Citgo Drama Will Never End. A US judge in Delaware extended the schedule for the auctioning of Citgo’s shares to August 18, marking yet another hiccup in the eight-year court case as investment firm Red Tree and other bidders are expected to submit improved offers for the refiner’s asset by mid-June.

EU Offers to Subsidize SAF. With sustainable aviation fuel still pricing $1,000 per metric tonne above conventional jet fuel, the European Union offered to subsidize some 200 million litres of SAF to help airline carriers meet the EU’s own stringent mandates as Brussels’ quota rises to 6% by 2030.

US Oil Will Do the Unthinkable in 2026. According to the EIA’s updated Short-Term Energy Outlook report, US crude oil production will decline next year and mark its first annual dip since the COVID-19 impact of 2021, expecting 13.37 million b/d in 2026 after an average of 13.42 million b/d this year.

Not Every LNG Facility Needs to be Built. US natural gas developer Venture Global (NYSE:VG) withdrew its application for the proposed 24 mtpa Delta LNG facility in Louisiana, instead focusing on the 18 mtpa Plaquemines Expansion Project which already saw a preliminary regulatory nod from the FERC.

Texas Drilling Slowdown Becomes Reality. Drilling permits for new oil and natural gas wells in Texas dropped by 34% in May to 504, down from 759 in the same month last year, with oil-prolific Midland seeing the largest decline, whilst natural gas permits remained roughly stagnant at 40 permits.

US Carmakers Struggle to Secure Rare Earths. US carmaker Ford (NYSE:F) announced that it was forced to idle production at its Chicago plant producing the Explorer SUV as inventories of rare earth components were ‘day to day’, signalling that potentially other sites could be shut down soon, too.

Boeing will invest $17.48 million CAD to strengthen the energy security of Canada and bolster the country’s economic growth. The investments will promote the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and are part of Boeing’s Industrial and Technological Benefits (ITB) commitment to Canada for its selection of Boeing’s P-8A Poseidon to fulfill its long-range, multi-mission aircraft role.

The investments will support two projects:

$10 million CAD for Project Avance: A joint venture between Bioenergie AECN and Alder Renewables in Port Cartier, Quebec, to convert wood residuals from existing sawmills into a low-carbon intermediate “biocrude” that can be converted into SAF. Project Avance is forecasted to enable future projects in Quebec to produce 10 million gallons (approximately 37,854,000 liters) of unblended SAF annually.

$7.48 million CAD for Dimensional Energy: The power-to-liquid technology provider will scope scaled development of its pioneering carbon utilization project to convert industrial CO2 emissions into synthetic aviation fuel production. This study will support future projects in North America to convert 500,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions to produce more than 40 million gallons (approximately 151,416,000 liters) of SAF annually.

“This significant investment in SAF production demonstrates our commitment to scaling sustainable aviation fuel and to our work in Canada, where we have driven innovation for over a century,” said Al Meinzinger, president, Boeing Canada. “With 2,000 employees across Canada, Boeing is committed to supporting Canada’s aerospace industry and domestic productivity and advancing exciting new energy innovations.”

“Our proprietary Alder Renewable Crude (ARC) product has enormous potential to fast-track the production of SAF in Canada,” said Darren Fuller, chief commercial officer of Alder Renewables. “The support of Boeing and local government leaders in Quebec is supercharging our commitment to securing a low carbon future for the aviation sector. Close collaboration with our industry partners — Boeing and Bioenergie AECN — coupled with government support is essential to get to the next phase. We’re ready to play our part.”

“Making high performance hydrocarbons is an innovative use for carbon dioxide that turns unwanted waste into valuable fuels and products,” said Jason Salfi, CEO of Dimensional Energy. “This investment from Boeing provides essential predevelopment capital to catalyze projects and scale our proven power-to-liquid technology to market now.”

“Boeing’s investments in Quebec and British Columbia highlight Canada’s position as a strategic partner of choice in sustainable aviation and will generate high-value jobs and economic growth,” said the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions. “The Government of Canada is committed to reducing aviation emissions and reinforcing Canada’s position as a global leader in aerospace innovation.”

The two SAF projects are part of Boeing’s over $280 million CAD investment in Canadian Clean Technology projects through the P-8 ITB program. Boeing investments will advance technologies that have the potential to unlock vast renewable resources and accelerate industries producing low-carbon fuels to meet the rising global demand. SAF has the potential today to reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% over the fuel’s lifecycle and offers the fastest route to decarbonization in the aviation sector.

The Government of Canada announced its decision to acquire the P-8A Poseidon aircraft in November 2023 as part of the Canadian Multi-Mission Aircraft (CMMA) project. These Boeing CMMA ITB investments build on more than $2 billion in P-8 contracts with Canadian companies to date, contributing to economic growth across the country. The purchase will generate benefits of nearly $358 CAD million annually in economic output to Canada, according to an independent study by Ottawa-based Doyletech Corp.

TIM ROBINSON FRAeS, STEPHEN BRIDGEWATER FRAeS and JACK RICHARDSON look ahead to what promises to be a fascinating event for the global aerospace, aviation and space industry.

From 16 to 22 June, Le Bourget airport on the outskirts of the French capital will play host to the 55th edition of the Paris Air Show. The event looks set to be large with 2,500 exhibitors from across 48 countries alongside 300,000 unique visitors and 300 start-up companies from 21 countries in attendance. 150 aircraft will be available with 210 flying displays scheduled. Like previous instalments, items on display will span the entire aerospace and defence sector with civil, military and space exhibits alike, alongside emerging fields such as urban air mobility as well as opportunities to progress careers.

This year, tragically, the aerospace industry gathers for this trade exhibition in the shadow of a horrific airliner crash - with the loss of an Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner with 242 people onboard from Ahmedabad to London Gatwick on 12 June as these words are written. Our thoughts are with the friends, families and colleagues of those involved in this tragedy and a reminder that although these trade shows may feature fierce corporate rivalry, in safety the industry works very closely together.

Yet more widely - this Paris Air Show comes at a time of massive geopolitical uncertainty and upheaval - with unexpected shocks rippling across all sectors, from commercial to defence and space, that is leaving aerospace professionals struggling to keep up with change. The War in Ukraine has now been joined by the US White House seemingly starting a trade war with the rest of the world, stepping back from its role as guarantor of European security and refocusing its space ambitions. All these have left partners, allies as well as adversaries floundering and scrambling to understand what the first, second and third order of effects will be from this reversal of globalisation and shake-up of the Post-WW2 security system.

The trouble with tariffs

A350 wing factory at Broughton - will the global aerospace industry get its wings clipped by protectionism? (Tim Robinson/RAeS)

Whereas announcements and discussions at the 2023 Paris Air Show focused on the rebound of global air travel demand in the post-pandemic era – and a growing push for sustainability – the 2025 edition is more likely to highlight how the airline sector can now navigate this large scale growth against the headwind of supply chain issues and global geopolitical uncertainty. The subject of tariffs will doubtless never be far from any announcements or discussions.

Airline manufacturing has been governed by the Agreement on Trade of Civil Aircraft since 1980. In the words of the World Trade Organisation, this eliminated import duties on “all aircraft, other than military aircraft, as well as on all other products covered by the agreement [including] civil aircraft engines and their parts and components, all components and sub-assemblies of civil aircraft, and flight simulators and their parts and components.” This mean that manufacturers could both sell aircraft around the world and also develop global supply chains without paying added costs in duties but now, 45 years later, this accord between 30 nations has been seemingly blown apart by US President Donald Trump’s global trade war.

Tariffs also have a non-direct impact on the airline industry, with the economic uncertainty they cause resulting in holiday makers and business travellers reducing spending on travel. That said, the long-term prospect for growth in air travel, buoyed by global GDP and a growing middle class in emerging markets remains strong.

Setting tariffs aside, supply chain issues remain the key concern for airlines and manufacturers. Aircraft deliveries peaked at 1,842 per year in 2018 and have never fully recovered from the pandemic-induced slump to 844 in 2020. Figures bounced back to a post-Covid high of 1,386 in 2023 but declined again to 1,264 last year as the fragility of the supply chain, lack of skilled workers and – in the case of Boeing – increased regulatory scrutiny – caused production bottlenecks. In 2024, Boeing’s production more than halved compared to the previous year but even Airbus continued to miss targets to ramp up production rates.

Elsewhere, Brazil’s Embraer recently recorded its best quarter of sales since 2016 in terms of revenue (across both commercial and military arms). The first quarter of 2025 accounted for $1.1bn in sales, representing a 23% year-over-year increase. Interestingly, while airline orders remained fairly stable over the period, the OEM’s business jet division reported a 35% increase in revenue.

The manufacturer expects to deliver between 77 and 85 commercial aircraft and 145 to 155 business jets this year. Over the first three months of 2025, its commercial aviation department delivered three E-195E2s and four E1 airliners while the bizav section handed over 23 executive jets to customers (two Phenom 100s, 12 Phenom 300s, three Praetor 500s and six Praetor 600s).

Meanwhile, Franco\Italian manufacturer ATR, the world’s largest producer of regional turboprop aircraft saw orders rise by 40% in 2024 including sales to 16 new operators. It received total orders for 56 aircraft (51 ATR72s and five ATR42s) over the year, giving it an order backlog of 150 airframes. The OEM says it will “highlight its commitment to accelerating sustainable connections” during the show. An ATR 72-600 in the colours of Brazilian airline Azul will be on static display throughout the week and a second example will participate in the daily flying display. Also expect an announcement of a further collaboration with RTX’s Pratt and Whitney Canada on future propulsion during the event.

In turboprops, De Havilland Canada's sales for 2024 saw a resurgence in orders, particularly for the Dash 8-400 with sales including ANA, Widerøe and the Tanzania Government Flight Agency. The Twin Otter is also proving a sales success and two examples will be on display at Paris during the week.

Although China’s COMAC is not slated to bring any airframes to Paris, the ongoing rollout of its C919 means the manufacturer will be hoping to seize the opportunity to tempt impatient airline bosses to jump ship from the ‘big two’. Whether COMAC speaks publicly about delays to the C929 programme and the threat to withhold US-manufactured engines and components for the C919 remains to be seen but the ongoing pariah status of Russian manufacturers and supply chain woes from Western OEMs presents COMAC with an opportunity to capitalise upon.

Despite the waiting lists there is still a strong appetite for fleet modernisation and new technology aircraft. Engine manufacturers are expected to make announcements at Paris over the future of open-fan, hydrogen, electric and hybrid propulsion, but can we expect any announcements of the much-awaited clean sheet narrowbody replacements for Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’ A320 Family? It seems unlikely.

However, keep an eye on the blended wing body concepts – JetZero is exhibiting at the show for the first time and may prove to be the event’s wildcards.

Among the airliners so far confirmed to be on display at Le Bourget for the week are De Havilland Canada’s Twin Otter Classic 300-G (and the military Twin Otter 400 Guardian variant), Textron’s Cessna SkyCourier, at least one ATR42/72, an Airbus A220, an Embraer E192-E2, a Riyadh Air Airbus A321neo and a Qatar Airways Boeing 777-300ER in a special livery showcasing the Paris Saint-Germain football team. A last minute addition will be a Riyadh Air 787 in the carrier's second livery.

Defence top of the agenda

With US President Donald Trump demanding that NATO partners pay their own way in defence, the war in Ukraine now in its third year, China unveiling stealth platforms, a recent clash between India and Pakistan and now massive Israeli air strikes on Iran's nuclear infrastructure – expect military hardware to take a higher profile than previous shows as nations refocus on rearming and boosting their defences in this new uncertain world.

With the NATO Summit just the following week, and members nations being urged to sign up for 5% commitment of GDP defence spending (3.5% on ‘hard power’) the Paris Air Show will be the stage for the world’s aerospace and defence companies to show off their wares. This will also see some civil aviation companies and start-ups show off dual-use technology in a bid to a get a slice of this pie.

While US companies will be out in force as usual, a key question for buyers nations now worried that an erratic Washington could exert pressure on them via withholding spares or technology will be ‘is this ITAR free?’. Additionally, with initiatives like the European Defence Fund (EDF) Europe is also seeking to stimulate and invest in European military R&D and defence suppliers.

With China having unveiled its three-engined J-36 in December and the US having selected Boeing to produce its F-47 NGAD, future fighters will be a key focus at the show – with the Franco-German-Spanish FCAS the centrepiece of continental Europe’s next-generation combat aircraft effort. Upgrading existing combat aircraft - such as Eurofighter and Rafale to bridge the gap between these current platforms and the 'sixth gen' platforms in development will also be a key theme. On display will be a Rafale with conformal tanks - showing off an option to increase the types range, without compromising its weapons payload.

Yet – the stunning attack by Ukraine on Russian strategic bomber bases, in a highly innovative SF operation using small drones will also be uppermost in military minds – both from the need to protect infrastructure from these sorts of threats, to exploiting this revolution in autonomy, AI and uncrewed systems.

Finally – there is likely to be a strong focus on boosting production of existing missiles and munitions – as lessons from Ukraine show how quickly nations can burn through stocks of missiles in a peer-on-peer conflict.

At the show, US company Anduril will showcase its Fury collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) in mock-up form, while Lockheed Martin/Sikorsky will be bringing its S-97 co-axial helicopter. Eurofighter, now increasing production with follow-on orders from Germany, Italy and Spain will have a Typhoon mock-up, while Boeing will be bringing an F-15 and Apache – the latter, incredibly, celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. The US DoD 'corral' will also feature a range of Boeing products including the C-17, CH-47, F-15, F/A-18, KC-46 and P-8. A Lockheed Martin F-35 will also be in the DoD static display.

The increasingly popular Embraer C-390 Millennium will be represented by the KC-390 variant in both the flying display at static exhibition. It will be joined on static display by an example of the company's A-29 Super Tucano light attack and advanced trainer.

Commercial aviation

Will Vietjet make a splash at the show? (Vietjet)

Paris ‘week’ has traditionally provided a flurry of orders for airliners manufactured by both Airbus (the home team) and Boeing, but recent years have also seen ATR scooping significant numbers of orders. The 2023 show also saw Canada’s De Havilland Aviation announce a slew of orders for its DHC-6 Twin Otter and DHC-8 airframes.

However, much has changed over the two years since the last show. Supply chains are even more fractured, Boeing has been tarred with both safety and regulatory brushes and – the latest wild card – tariffs are now threatening to impact orders on both sides of the Atlantic.

In 2024, Boeing secured 569 orders for new airliners with Airbus receiving firm commitments for 878 airframes. By the end of May 2025, Boeing had announced 249 orders (44% of last year’s entire sales) with Airbus slightly ahead at 291. However, in the case of the European giant this figure is just 33% of its total 2024 sales. These figures will doubtless be boosted during the week at Le Bourget, and Airbus announced a hitherto unheard of ‘zero’ sales in its May earnings call suggesting that it is holding back announcements to unveil during the show.

Interestingly, the orders announced during the first five months of 2025 are dominated by legacy full-service operators, with low-cost carriers seemingly feeling the pinch from a slowdown in travel bookings. That said, the trend towards extended range narrowbody aircraft is likely to see the A321XLR featuring heavily in the orderbook. While transatlantic travel from Europe to the US shows signs of slowing due to concerns over tariffs, visas and other US policies, the long haul travel sector continues to strengthen as airlines expand their global networks. With Chinese and Indian carriers eyeing up routes to Europe, could this result in a boom in orders for Boeing’s Dreamliner and/or Airbus’ A350?

Industry insiders are tipping Malaysia's AirAsia as potentially announcing an order for at least 100 Airbus aircraft during the show, potentially including the A220 for regional operations. Vietjet is also reportedly planning an announcement to acquire around 100 Airbus narrowbody airliners at Paris. The order is believed to relate to A321neos, adding to the 35 it has in service and a further 77 on order.

Reports in the Indian media ahead of the show suggests low-cost carrier IndiGo Airlines could be making an announcement at Paris regarding the possible acquisition of between 30 and 50 ATR72-600s. It already operates 48 of the aircraft.

Other airlines worth watching for with regard to orders include Qatar Airways (A320 Family) Riyadh Air (A350s) and Etihad Airways (A350s), Air India, and Royal Air Maroc. The latter has stated its aim to grow its fleet from 59 to 200 ahead of the 2030 World Cup in Morocco, Spain and Portugal.

Space

Le Bourget is not just an air show – it is also a space show where some of the world’s leading space agencies, satellite and launcher companies come together. However, this year will be an air of uncertainty as international partners digest the impact of US cuts to NASA – and what that might mean for joint missions and projects.

In human spaceflight, the US is intending to axe SLS, Orion after Artemis III, as well as the Lunar Gateway and reduce funding to the ISS - in a pivot to Mars. Both Orion (with Airbus providing the European Built Service module) and Lunar Gateway featured extensive international partnership – and now potentially leave other space agencies adrift.

With NASA-led Earth Observation and planetary science missions also under threat, Paris could be a key venue for space agencies to explore new international partnerships and even perhaps an opportunity to take the lead in some areas, if the US goes ahead with its plan to gut NASA’s science mission.

Yet European orbital launch capability from European soil is still yet to arrive – with Germany’s Rocket Factory Augsburg RFA One exploding on the launch pad at SaxaVord, in the Shetland Islands in August 2024 and Isar Aerospace also suffering a failure of its rocket from Norway’s Andøya spaceport in March. Could 2025 be the year in which a European-built rocket launches from Europe?

Finally, and connected to the defence theme of sovereign capability, there will also be discussions on how Europe can reduce its dependence on US space capability – whether Starlink, US launchers or military space. Attention will therefore be given to whether European can repurpose or develop military capabilities – for example in spy satellites using civil Earth Observation satellites.

Game of drones

Airbus plans to display a mock up of its Aliaca-VTOL drone at the show. (Airbus)

As the war in Ukraine has continued, the importance of loitering and one-way attack drones has grown seemingly by the day -and the Paris Air Show will be a showcase for those evolving. A well-established player in this segment is Israel’s UVision which will display what it claims is a world first at the show. This takes the form of a helicopter -launched variant of its HERO-120 loitering munition. The company has developed this in partnership with American companies Fulcrum Concepts and Mistral, to meet a requirement of the US Marine Corps. Already a HERO-120 user, the munition could be deployed from AH-1Z Viper and UH-1Y helicopters as well as the F-35C fighter, MV-22 tilt-rotor and CH-53K heavy lift helicopter as part of the service’s long-range attack munition requirement.

Also representing Israel will be Aeronautics Group Ltd, displaying its Orbiter family of UAVs including the VTOL Orbiter 4 and larger, MALE, Orbiter 5. A similar offer to the former will be exhibited by French firm Aeronefs services, whose LR2M VTOL can be assembled in as little as 10 minutes while Norway’s Rift Dynamics will display the Wasp, which it describes as a cross between a surveillance drone and FPV device. As the importance of FPV drones has grown, the US’s Neros Technologies will present its Archer solution.

Making its debut at Paris will be Walkyrie Engineering’s WAD cannister launched UAV. Able to be deployed from vertical or horizontal positions, the WAD can be deployed in a variety of applications including ISR and countering other UAVs, featuring the ability to be recovered. The company will also be showcasing JUMP, a larger, longer range, fixed wing, VTOL UAV. With the proliferation of cheap and disposable UAVs, a key issue is how to counter them, and in this vein, France’s Destinus will present the Hornet UAV, which is designed to neutralise kamikaze drones. The company will also be showcasing the HORNET 30 one-way attack drone and RUTA high speed, high-altitude vehicle. One exhibitor displaying UAV solutions will be Cobtec International with its Sunflower UAV range of patrol drones. With a patrol range of up to 1,000km, this is offered in two models with the A version guided by GPS and the B using onboard visual systems.

Another established player in the UAV space is Austria’s Scheibel, which with its growing customer base, will exhibit its S-300 rotary-wing UAV, a larger version of its popular S-100. Also growing its presence across Europe is Portugal’s Tekever, which will exhibit is AR3 and AR5 UAVs at the show. The former has a 12 hour endurance and has the option of eVTOL flight whereas the latter is a can operate beyond radio line of sight for up to 18 hours. Moving to larger companies, Airbus will display several UAV mock ups, including the Aliaca-VTOL, a vertical take-off and landing UAV for maritime or land-based surveillance missions. It combines fixed-wing flight efficiency with multirotor flexibility for take-off and landing, offering up to 3 hours of endurance. The pan-European company will also have on display a mock up of the VSR700 navalised rotary wing UAV, which can carry out roles such as anti-submarine warfare and ISR.

A particularly eye catching offer will be the Moya cargo drone produced by Brazilian company Moya Aero. A innovative feature of this drone is that it tilts its whole body forward inflight in order to carry out roles including crop spraying, surveying or general logistics. Available in pure electric or hybrid-electric mode, the company is in the process of certifying this drone, which has extensive commonality across the two variants. Similarly, the US’s PteroDynamics Inc will be displaying its ‘transwing’ autonomous eVTOL where the wings hold close to the body but upon take-off spread out during transition to horizontal flight. This allows the aircraft to occupy a smaller footprint when on the ground, with applications including public safety and automated cargo delivery.

General Aviation

In recent years France has developed a reputation for the support of innovative General Aviation (GA) aircraft, particularly in the ultralight and very light aircraft (VLA) sectors. The 2023 edition of the Paris Air Show saw Elixir Aviation exhibiting a hydrogen-powered prototype of its H55 two-seater and Airbus, Daher and Safran showed off the yet to be flown ecoPulse demonstrator. The ecoPulse, which is based on a TBM960, was a distributed hybrid-propulsion aircraft with multiple small engines distributed along the wingspan. The aircraft flew in November 2023 and the project ended in December 2024, having reportedly met its objectives. This year, Daher will be exhibiting both its TBM960 and Kodiak 100 turboprops at the show as well as bringing back ecoPulse.

Elixir Aviation has announced plans to debut the turbine-powered variant of its two-seat aircraft during the show. Powered by a Turbotech TP-R90 turboprop, the aircraft will be on display at the French DGAC’s booth.

Toulouse-based Aura Aero is understood to be displaying its Integral R, S and E aircraft in formation during the daily air display. The recently certified R is a two-seat trainer constructed of composite and wood and has already found favour with aerobatic flying schools. The S (the same as the R but with a nosewheel instead of a tailwheel) is expected to receive certification later this year with the electric-powered Integral E to follow in due course.

Belgium-based JMB Aircraft will be exhibiting the prototype of a turbine powered variant of its VL3 ultralight at the show. The basic VL3, which has just been certified by the British Microlight Aircraft Association in the UK, is now available in Europe with a variety of Rotax powerplants from 100-160hp and either fixed or retractable undercarriage, but the variant on display at Paris has the Turbotech TP-R90 turboprop up front.

Of course Paris week is all about selling aircraft, but one aeroplane in particular is being sold to raise money for a very special cause. A Nynja ultralight, built by students, is being auctioned during the show to support the Aviation Sans Frontières charity. It is hoped that the proceeds will help fund a Cessna Caravan ‘flying hospital’ designed to deliver care in remote regions.

Austria’s Diamond Aircraft has announced it will be bringing a DA-62MPP multi-mission variant of its familiar twin-engined touring aircraft but there is no word yet about whether its much promised electric eDA40 will attend. The latter flew too late to make its intended debut at the 2023 Paris Air Show and although it was exhibited statically at the AERO event in Friedrichshafen, Germany in 2024, it was notably missing from this year’s event.

Textron’s Cessna SkyCourier is slated to attend Paris for the first time, with the twin-engined combi-freighter/passenger aircraft marking its fifth anniversary in 2025 with more than 50 airframes now delivered to owners around the world.

Also part of the Textron group, Beechcraft has announced plans to debut its latest KingAir variant at the show. Based on the familiar KingAir 360, the new machine is a multi-mission demonstrator featuring extended-range fuel tanks, factory installed wing hardpoints and a large cargo door. It is targeted at aeromedical and survey operators as well as for quasi-military use. A factory installed option is an extended nose that can house sensors as well as a retractable electro-optical/infrared sensor turret.

Meanwhile, fellow Textron company Bell Helicopter is listed as bringing a Bell 407Gxi, 429, 505 JetRanger and 525 Relentless helicopters to the show. An interesting debutant in the flying display will be the Airbus RACER (Rapid And Cost-Effective Rotorcraft) high-speed helicopter demonstrator. Developed under the European Clean Sky 2 research programme, the aircraft was unveiled at the Paris Air Show in 2017 and is developed to cruise at over 210kts while using less fuel than a conventional helicopter. Featuring stub-wing mounted pusher propellers that pull power from the main engines to provide forward thrust, the aircraft first flew in April 2024 and is expected to be one of the stars of the show.

Business aviation is always represented well at Paris and among the debutants in 2025 will be US-based Otto Aviation which is promising a clean-sheet bizjet featuring laminar-flow aerodynamics. The Phantom 3500, which is a development of the diesel-powered Celera 500 research aircraft, will be powered by Williams International FJ44 engines and is notable for having no windows – these being replaced by 42in 4k monitors to show a projection of the outside world.

Interestingly, plans to develop a hydrogen-powered 19-seater called the Celera 750 have been placed on hold. Initially announced in 2022, this would have used a ZeroAvia hydrogen-fuel-cell powertrain.

While Otto will not have a full-sized aircraft on display at Le Bourget, Dassault will be using its home show to advantage with examples of the Falcon 6X and 8X business jets on static display throughout the week. The Falcon 6X will also be taking part in the daily flying display. Gulfstream will be exhibiting its G600 and G700 (with Qatar Airways bringing another G700) while Piaggio is bringing its Avanti II Evo and Pilatus will be attending with both its PC-12 and PC-24.

Urban Air Mobility

The last Paris Air Show (in 2023) featured a dedicated Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) hall with eVTOLs displayed in an urban setting. The daily airshow was also opened with a flying appearance by Volocopter’s VoloCity eVTOL with the company proudly announcing plans for the following year’s Paris Olympics. Since then, a number of high profile players in the market have ceased trading (including Volocopter) but others, including Joby Aviation, Archer and Vertical Aerospace have advanced their flight-test programmes and are targeting certification within the next 24 months.

With the metaphorical wheat sorted from the chaff, the AAM sector is now at a point where certification timelines as well as regulatory and airspace harmonisation and infrastructure/planning constraints - rather than technological challenges - are now the limiting factor in the pace of development.

One of the AAM companies exhibiting at Paris is Brazil's Eve Air Mobility, which is promising to unveil advancements to its eVTOL ahead of a promised first flight later this summer. Eve has begun ground tests and says its goal is to have five to six conforming prototypes ready to perform development and certification flights between 2025 and 2026.

Among the refinements to the design that Eve is expected to reveal during the show is a new wheeled landing gear option, a new cabin layout, modified aerodynamics for the wing design and enhancements to the lifter and pusher propeller/rotor blades. Announcements are also expected regarding the fly-by-wire four axis sidestick controllers. Boeing will also showcase its Wisk autonomous passenger aircraft with at least one example of the latest variant on display in its pavilion.

Also expect a return from China's Ehang, which will be displaying its fully autonomous EH216S eVTOL - now certificated and running passenger flights (in a very controlled manner) in China.

Sustainable aviation

While sustainability is unlikely to be as front and centre as it has been at previous trade shows it will remain a key theme of announcements over the week ahead. Airbus’ recent delays to its ZEROe hydrogen programme and public commentary by IATA Director General, Willie Walsh, about the need to revisit net zero 2050 targets due to (among other things) the scarcity of sustainable aviation fuel should lead to interesting debate and it will be interesting to hear what predictions are made for future ‘green’ initiatives.

With its Integral GA aircraft progressing, Toulouse-based start-up Aura Aviation will be providing an update on its other flagship project. The company is developing the Era hybrid-electric 19 seat regional airliner which is targeted at transport and special mission applications such as aeromedical evacuation. Notably, Aura Aviation states that the aircraft’s cabin will be constructed using recycled and biodegradable materials. With a first flight planned for next year followed by service entry in 2028, the 19 seat Era has also evolved to field a military variant termed the Intruder, which will be produced at the company’s Abu Dhabi-based subsidiary M.

Also flying the French flag for innovative aviation will be fellow start-up Volt Aero. The company will be unveiling its Cassio 330 design on 15 June. From the now well-known mock-up, it stands out with a pusher propellor, twin boom tail and forward canards. Offered in hybrid-electric configuration, the single pilot certified aircraft is offered in three sizes which can seat a number of passengers ranging from five to 12 while being offered for wider applications such as postal delivery.

As part of a lengthy European tour en-route to Norway, where it is destined to be trialled by Bristow Group, Beta Technologies' Alia CX300 is slated to attend the show in Paris. This is the electric conventional take-off and landing (eCTOL) variant of the battery-powered aircraft and can accommodate up to five passengers or 1,250lb of cargo. Beta claims the aircraft has operating costs that are a fraction of Cessna Caravan and also produces 75% fewer emissions.

From Switzerland, Smartflyer will bring its as-yet unflown SFX1 hybrid-electric aircraft to Paris. Featuring an electric motor supported by a thermal generator, it offers a range of up to 500 miles but future plans also include a hydrogen fuel cell power system

Although concerns remain about the ability to produce and store hydrogen, several participants in the show will display their hydrogen propulsion solutions. One is China’s H100 Atlas, a hydrogen powered quadcopter UAV for diverse applications including cleaning solar panels and fighting forest fires. On the homegrown side, Blue Spirit Aerosystems will be displaying their Dragonfly light aircraft, powered by 12 hydrogen fuel cell propellors. Plans are for this aircraft to enter service in 2029. With detailed design ongoing, the aircraft has a planned range of up to 375nm for its 4S model, rising to 540nm in its enhanced 6S version.

Another area with growing levels of investment and an array of new entrants in seaplanes, driven by the desire to take advantage of the ready-made infrastructure water ways provide. One exhibitor will be Japan’s Shinmaywa who produce the rescue orientated US-2. A company that is looking to deploy seaplanes against the growing threat of wildfires is France’s Positive Aviation, who have plans to convert surplus ATR-72 airliners into FF72 floatplanes, for the aerial firefighting role.

Career opportunities

From military to commercial and space to GA, the aviation and aerospace sector is struggling to attract and retain talent. (Paris Air Show/Anthony Guerra)

One of the main issues facing the industry at the moment is how to attract and retain skilled people, particularly when competing with better paid career options. Therefore, the show will play host to the ‘Careers Plane’ which will provide a forum for young people to be shown the opportunities and needs of the French aerospace industry. This part of the show will feature professionals from across 20 potential careers in aerospace ranging from electronics engineers, to machining operators and customer service professionals. Options from school to apprenticeship and university level will be on display.

As reported by TravelPulse, United Airlines announced an investment in Twelve. The startup plans to create a low-carbon alternative fuel that is projected to produce up to 90% less harmful pollution than current aviation fuel.

While the startup's fuel plant is not yet operational, the concept shows a lot of promise. The fuel will be made by capturing carbon from the air and extracting hydrogen from water and then putting the elements through an industrial process that is similar to photosynthesis.

Twelve has already secured funding to build its plant in Moses Lake, Washington, where it expects to produce 50,000 gallons of sustainable aviation fuel every year.

Nicholas Flanders, the startup's co-founder and CEO, said, ""United's Sustainable Flight Fund's investment reinforces our momentum at a pivotal moment as we move from innovation to implementation,"" per TravelPulse.

This is a great step toward reducing the harmful pollution produced by flying. According to Our World in Data, aviation is responsible for around 2.5% of global carbon dioxide pollution every year. This may not sound like a lot, but only around 11% of the world's population flies, a figure that is projected to increase as global salaries rise.

Watch now: How bad is a gas stove for your home's indoor air quality?

The development of sustainable aviation fuels will reduce harmful pollution and help the industry transition to a more sustainable future and meet net-zero targets.

Looking for alternative transport options is another way to reduce the impact of aviation. Taking trains instead of short-haul flights and reducing the number of private jets in the skies can contribute to lowering the harmful pollution produced by the industry.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VX5hmzvd50rm_nOTX0bV8w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03MDM7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/110195211d2c86f46e3a3696ff0ef40e,N,,2025-06-13 09:56:12.911010

It is also the largest buyer of sustainable aviation fuel in the private aviation sector, according to the executive.","Private aviation leader NetJets is maintaining its post-Covid momentum, benefiting from several ongoing trends.

In an interview with Fortune TV, NetJets Aviation President Patrick Gallagher said that experiential luxury, the desire for privacy, and spotty airline service continue to provide a “tailwind” for the unit of Berkshire Hathaway.

Gallagher says following record demand in 2021 and 2022 for the industry, NetJets has maintained its growth trend.

Including its aircraft management arm, Executive Jet Management, the company operates around 1,100 private jets.

Gallagher pointed out that it would rank it among the biggest airlines in the world.

Per FlightRadar, only American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta Air Lines have larger fleets.

However, airline moves to target premium passengers haven’t impacted demand for private aviation, according to Gallagher.

He tells Fortune TV, “The commercial experience has not gotten any better over the last several years, and that has driven more people to want to fly NetJets.”

He adds that the top private aviation company, ranked by charter and fractional hours, is building on the increases from the Covid period.

Gallagher says that before Covid, only about 10% of affluent consumers who fit the private aviation financial profile flew privately.

NetJets’ customer base today is 40 to 45% larger than it was in 2019, before the pandemic.

While some providers say newcomers have left, Gallagher says NetJets has “maintained record retention.”

91.7% of Private Jet Card Comparisons subscribers ranked NetJets Excellent/Very Good in last year’s survey.

The industry average for Excellent/Very Good ratings across all fractional and jet card providers was 73.3%.

The same survey shows over 95% of flyers who started flying during or since Covid continue to fly the private skies.

Post-Covid Tailwinds

In a post-pandemic era, Gallagher says new trends are powering the company.

“In the luxury travel segment overall, people are making more of an investment in experiences than in things. That certainly has been a tailwind for us,” he says.

Flight trackers and the desire for privacy are also driving the growth of its fractional ownership model.

“One of the appeals of flying NetJets as opposed to owning your own airplane is you are virtually untraceable,” Gallagher says.

It is also maintaining its position in the world of big business.

Gallagher says about 40% of Fortune 500 companies are customers.

However, its primary audience is principals of privately held companies.

NetJets Sustainability

Gallagher also addressed the sustainability issue of flying privately, which is often used as a cudgel by anti-wealth campaigners.

“Sustainability is at the forefront of our industry,” Gallagher says.

For NetJets, it offsets all of its internal and training flights.

It is also the largest buyer of sustainable aviation fuel in the private aviation sector, according to the executive.

Additionally, it offers a program that allows customers to purchase offsets for their flights.

According to CH-Aviation, NetJets has the youngest fleet among large operators.",https://cdn.privatejetcardcomparisons.com/uploads/Patrick-Gallagher-President-NetJets.png?w=1200&h=628&fit=crop,N,,2025-06-13 09:56:25.502844

More than 60 vehicles involved in airport operations are now running on biodiesel instead of fossil-based diesel. These include airfield operations and security team vehicles, fire trucks and snow clearing vehicles.

The airport has worked with biodiesel supplier YourNRG to bring about the change, which comes as its parent company, Manchester Airports Group (MAG), launches its five-year Sustainability Strategy, Creating a sustainable future for all.

The airport’s biodiesel is produced from waste vegetable oils and fats which undergo a hydrogen treatment to be turned into renewable fuel which reduces carbon emissions by up to 90% compared to fossil diesel. It also drastically lowers particulate emissions and is biodegradable, making it safer for the environment than traditional diesel.

East Midlands Airport’s managing director, Steve Griffiths, said: “We are always looking at ways to reduce our impact on the environment, with the aim of hitting Manchester Airport Group’s target of achieving net-zero operations by 2038.

“Working with YourNRG to convert our fleet of ground vehicles is a great step forward, with significant emissions reductions and other environmental benefits.”

By increasing the supply of sustainable aviation fuel for planes, the Bill can support airport expansion by cutting the climate impacts of flights, meaning more flights can take off.

The Bill will continue to make its way through Parliament and will support the £63 million of investment already announced earlier in the year to help boost SAF production, as well as £400,000 to support the testing of new green fuels, helping to get them to market quicker.

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said: “We could put our head in the sand and pretend people don’t want to fly. Pretend the sector doesn’t support hundreds of thousands of jobs. That people don’t long for summer holidays and family reunions. That air freight isn’t a significant part of our trade by value. But we’d be on the wrong side of both reality and public aspiration. The truth is demand for flight is only going in one direction…

“This Bill creates a Revenue Certainty Mechanism that will boost SAF production by giving investors’ confidence to choose the UK. It does this by addressing one of the biggest barriers to investment - the lack of a clear, predictable market price for SAF.”

The findings provide crucial insights for aerospace leaders transitioning to sustainable, low-emission fuels whilst ensuring safety and reliability remain uncompromised.

Addressing Critical Industry Challenges

As the aerospace industry intensifies its focus on decarbonisation, SAFs offer substantial CO2 reductions of over 65 percent compared to traditional jet fuels. However, challenges such as seal compatibility continue to present obstacles to widespread adoption. To address these concerns, Greene Tweed conducted rigorous testing to ensure its seals perform effectively with these advanced fuel formulations.

Shawn McCloskey, Greene Tweed’s chief commercial officer, emphasised the practical significance of the research. “Sustainable aviation fuels offer a practical path to reducing emissions, particularly for long-haul flights, where batteries and hydrogen remain less feasible,” McCloskey said. “Our study ensures aerospace customers have reliable seal solutions for SAF adoption without compromising safety or performance.”

Comprehensive Testing Methodology

Greene Tweed collaborated with multiple suppliers to evaluate SAF blends and their effects on the physical properties of fluorine-based elastomers FKM and FVMQ. The study assessed performance across various SAF blends, including Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK) and Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (SAK), following ASTM D7566 standards.

Testing protocols simulated extreme aerospace environments, including temperatures reaching 120°C and prolonged SAF exposure conditions to ensure real-world applicability.

Key Research Findings

The study yielded several significant findings that demonstrate the viability of Greene Tweed’s seal solutions for SAF applications:

Consistent Performance was observed across FKM compounds (731, 772, 665), which maintained their effectiveness across various blends, including three SPKs, 50/50 blends with control fluid, and 20 percent SAK with 80 percent SPKs.

Material Properties testing revealed that FKM elastomers demonstrated strong compatibility with harsh SAF conditions, including fluid ageing and dry-out scenarios that commonly occur in aerospace applications.

Aromatic Content Impact emerged as a critical factor, with the research confirming that aromatic content in SAF formulations, particularly SAK blends, plays a vital role in maintaining material performance.

Advanced Testing Protocols under accelerated ageing conditions provided confirmation of long-term reliability, addressing industry concerns about component longevity.

Dr Ronald Campbell, senior technical advisor at Greene Tweed, highlighted the comprehensive nature of the research. “By analysing the effects of chemical interactions between SAF blends and advanced elastomers, we have developed a robust data set that established long-term reliability and compatibility in extreme aerospace conditions,” Campbell noted.

Supporting Industry Decarbonisation Goals

The research arrives at a critical juncture for the aviation industry, which is working towards carbon-neutral growth targets. US airlines have set ambitious goals for a 50 percent CO2 reduction by 2050, making SAFs a vital component of decarbonisation strategies.

Greene Tweed’s findings directly support these environmental objectives by ensuring component compatibility with SAF whilst maintaining the safety and operational performance standards required in aerospace applications.

Industry Engagement and Future Applications

The research results were recently highlighted in an Aviation Week webinar, where Greene Tweed detailed its comprehensive testing methodology and findings. The company’s representatives will also present these solutions at the upcoming Paris Air Show 2025, providing industry professionals with opportunities to explore practical applications of the technology.

The study represents a significant advancement in addressing one of the key technical challenges facing SAF adoption, potentially accelerating the industry’s transition to more sustainable fuel alternatives whilst maintaining the rigorous safety and performance standards essential to aerospace operations.",https://storageterminalsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ST-318214319-copy-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 08:56:46.799111

But a new report takes a big swing at the ethanol orthodoxy of American agriculture, criticizing the industry for causing economic and social imbalances across rural communities and saying that the expansion of biofuels will increase greenhouse gas emissions, despite their purported climate benefits.

The report, from the World Resources Institute, which has been critical of U.S. biofuel policy in the past, draws from 100 academic studies on biofuel impacts. It concludes that ethanol policy has been largely a failure and ought to be reconsidered, especially as the world needs more land to produce food to meet growing demand.

“Multiple studies show that U.S. biofuel policies have reshaped crop production, displacing food crops and driving up emissions from land conversion, tillage and fertilizer use,” said the report’s lead author, Haley Leslie-Bole. “Corn-based ethanol, in particular, has contributed to nutrient runoff, degraded water quality and harmed wildlife habitat. As climate pressures grow, increasing irrigation and refining for first-gen biofuels could deepen water scarcity in already drought-prone parts of the Midwest.”

The conversion of Midwestern agricultural land has been sweeping. Between 2004 and 2024, ethanol production increased by nearly 500 percent. Corn and soybeans are now grown on 92 and 86 million acres of land respectively—and roughly a third of those crops go to produce ethanol. That means about 30 million acres of land that could be used to grow food crops are instead being used to produce ethanol, despite ethanol only accounting for 6 percent of the country’s transportation fuel.

The biofuels industry—which includes refiners, corn and soy growers and the influential agriculture lobby writ large—have long insisted that corn- and soy-based biofuels provide an energy efficient alternative to fossil-based fuels. Congress and the U.S. Department of Agriculture have agreed.

The country’s primary biofuels policy, the Renewable Fuel Standard, requires that biofuels provide a greenhouse gas reduction over fossil fuels: The law says that ethanol from new plants must deliver a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to gasoline.

In addition to greenhouse gas reductions, the industry and its allies in Congress have also continued to say that ethanol is a primary mainstay of the rural economy, benefiting communities across the Midwest.

But a growing body of research—much of which the industry has tried to debunk and deride—suggests that ethanol actually may not provide the benefits that policies require. It may, in fact, produce more greenhouse gases than the fossil fuels it was intended to replace. Recent research says that biofuel refiners also emit significant amounts of carcinogenic and dangerous substances, including hexane and formaldehyde, in greater amounts than petroleum refineries.

The new report points to research saying that increased production of biofuels from corn and soy could actually raise greenhouse gas emissions, largely from carbon emissions linked to clearing land in other countries to compensate for the use of land in the Midwest.

On top of that, corn is an especially fertilizer-hungry crop requiring large amounts of nitrogen-based fertilizer, which releases huge amounts of nitrous oxide when it interacts with the soil. American farming is by far the largest source of domestic nitrous oxide emissions already—about 50 percent. If biofuel policies lead to expanded production, emissions of this enormously powerful greenhouse gas will likely increase, too.

The new report concludes that not only will the expansion of ethanol increase greenhouse gas emissions, it has also failed to provide the social and financial benefits to Midwestern communities that lawmakers and the industry say it has. (The report defines the Midwest as Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio,

South Dakota and Wisconsin.)

“The benefits from biofuels remain concentrated in the hands of a few,” Leslie-Bole said. “As subsidies flow, so may the trend of farmland consolidation, increasing inaccessibility of farmland in the Midwest and locking out emerging or low-resource farmers. This means the benefits of biofuels production are flowing to fewer people, while more are left bearing the costs.”

New policies being considered in state legislatures and Congress, including additional tax credits and support for biofuel-based aviation fuel, could expand production, potentially causing more land conversion and greenhouse gas emissions, widening the gap between the rural communities and rich agribusinesses at a time when food demand is climbing and, critics say, land should be used to grow food instead.

President Donald Trump’s tax cut bill, passed by the House and currently being negotiated in the Senate, would not only extend tax credits for biofuels producers, it specifically excludes calculations of emissions from land conversion when determining what qualifies as a low-emission fuel.

The primary biofuels industry trade groups, including Growth Energy and the Renewable Fuels Association, did not respond to Inside Climate News requests for comment or interviews.

An employee with the Clean Fuels Alliance America, which represents biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel producers, not ethanol, said the report vastly overstates the carbon emissions from crop-based fuels by comparing the farmed land to natural landscapes, which no longer exist.

The aviation industry alongside government and manufacturing bodies is driving toward net-zero emissions which leads to substantial growth in the global SAF market that promises cleaner and greener airways.

🌱 What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel encompasses alternative fuels derived from biomass, waste oils, municipal solid waste, algae, or captured CO₂ which enable aircraft to operate with reduced carbon emissions compared to standard jet fuel.

Depending on both feedstock type and production techniques SAF achieves lifecycle greenhouse gas emission reductions of up to 80% which positions it as a fundamental element of aviation's decarbonization roadmap.

✈️ Why Airlines Are Fueling Up on SAF

The aviation industry presently generates between 2 and 3 percent of worldwide CO₂ emissions which are expected to increase when air travel returns to normal after the pandemic. A growing number of airlines have established bold climate pledges which include achieving net-zero emissions by the year 2050.

SAF delivers a critical contribution to aviation decarbonization by providing a drop-in fuel option compatible with current aircraft and fueling systems which removes the requirement for extensive retrofits or new technology deployment. The production increase enables immediate scalability.

Major airlines such as United Airlines, British Airways, Lufthansa and Emirates have started integrating SAF into their operations through long-term off-take contracts with fuel producers.

📈 Market Outlook: Soaring to New Heights

Projections from the industry suggest the global SAF market will expand from USD 576.18 million in 2022 to more than USD 15.85 billion by 2030 with a CAGR above 57.5%. Key drivers include:

The European Union and United States authorities enforce regulations that require aviation fuels to decrease their carbon intensity levels.

The requirement for sustainable corporate travel is forcing airlines to implement eco-friendly travel options.

The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act’s SAF tax credit operates as an incentive and subsidy for sustainable aviation fuels.

Technological innovations are reducing production costs while simultaneously boosting yield efficiency.

Europe leads the way in SAF adoption because of strict environmental policies and ReFuelEU mandates yet North America and Asia-Pacific focus on building significant domestic SAF production capabilities.

🌍 Global Collaboration: Policy Meets Innovation

Multiple stakeholders beyond airlines contribute to the growing momentum behind SAF. Governments and fuel producers along with airports and technology companies are building strategic partnerships to expand production output.

The Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition and ICAO's CORSIA framework develop a unified SAF adoption roadmap. Both startups and large energy corporations are pioneering new production technologies such as power-to-liquid synthetic fuels and carbon capture-based synthesis methods.

🚧 Challenges on the Flight Path

Despite its promise, SAF adoption faces hurdles:

High costs: The price of SAF stands at two to five times higher than that of conventional fossil-based jet fuel at present.

Limited supply: The usage of SAF makes up under 0.1% of the total aviation fuel consumption worldwide today.

Feedstock competition: Bio-based resources face growing pressure because sectors like shipping and road transport require more demand.

Production scaling combined with better logistics systems and growing investor trust works to gradually overcome existing challenges.

🛫 The Future of Green Flight

Experts predict that Sustainable Aviation Fuel needs to make up 65% of all aviation fuel by 2050 to help achieve global net-zero objectives. The future holds significant potential with upcoming advances in advanced biofuels and synthetic fuels that promise to both lower emissions and build a resilient aviation sector prepared for future challenges.

The EU is offering generous subsidies with the hope that it will induce the use of greater volumes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which will be able to dramatically reduce the sector’s carbon footprint. The action is just one of the steps the EU is taking in an effort to tackle climate change in addition to greening aviation.

A Game Changer for the Aviation Sector

Under this new program, the EU has committed to subsidising the purchase of over 200 million litres of SAF. This volume represents about 15% of the current global SAF production, as calculated by the European Commission. With the airline industry producing around 1.3 billion litres of SAF last year, this initiative is expected to give a substantial boost to SAF consumption, helping the aviation sector reduce its reliance on fossil fuels.

In terms of financial support, the EU is using funds from the sale of carbon emissions permits to cover the price gap between traditional kerosene and SAF. This approach is expected to make SAF more competitive, as it currently costs several times more than conventional jet fuel.

Key Features of the EU SAF Subsidy Program

The EU’s subsidy plan offers significant financial backing to airlines looking to transition to greener fuel. Here’s how it works:

Subsidy Amounts: Airlines can receive subsidies of up to 6 euros per litre for e-fuels (synthetic fuels made from captured CO2) and 0.5 euros per litre for biofuels.

Volume of Subsidised SAF: The program supports up to 216 million litres of e-fuels or up to 2.6 billion litres of biofuels.

Carbon Emissions Permits: The EU is funding this initiative through revenues from the sale of carbon emissions permits. This is intended to offset the higher cost of SAF, which remains a major barrier to widespread adoption.

This subsidy program is a crucial step in helping airlines make SAF a viable alternative to kerosene. As airlines are pressured to meet the EU’s sustainability targets, these subsidies will ease the financial strain of transitioning to cleaner energy sources.

Challenges in Decarbonizing the Aviation Industry

The aviation sector has long been one of the hardest industries to decarbonize, primarily due to the high energy demands of air travel and the current lack of viable zero-emission aircraft. While sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is seen as the most promising near-term solution, it still faces significant hurdles:

High Costs: SAF is significantly more expensive than traditional jet fuel, often costing three to five times more. This cost difference is a major obstacle to its widespread use.

Limited Supply: Currently, SAF accounts for only 0.3% of the global jet fuel supply, which highlights the sector’s reliance on fossil fuels.

Investment Gaps: Despite the potential benefits, the aviation industry has invested only a small portion of its revenue—typically between 1% and 3%—in SAF production, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group.

Given these challenges, the EU’s subsidy program is a critical intervention aimed at accelerating the adoption of SAF and reducing aviation’s carbon footprint.

EU’s Ambitious Targets for SAF Adoption

The European Union has set clear targets for SAF usage at EU airports, which airlines are expected to meet in the coming years. These targets are part of the EU’s broader climate action plan:

2% SAF by 2025: By 2025, 2% of the fuel used at EU airports must come from SAF.

6% SAF by 2030: This requirement will rise to 6% by 2030, aligning with the EU’s long-term decarbonisation goals.

To ensure these targets are met, airlines are required to purchase carbon emissions permits to offset the greenhouse gases produced by their flights. These permits were previously provided to airlines for free but are now being phased out, pushing airlines to reduce their emissions more rapidly.

The Role of SAF in the EU’s Green Transition

The push for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is part of the EU’s broader commitment to reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainability across various industries. As aviation accounts for a significant portion of global emissions, transitioning to SAF represents a major step towards achieving the EU’s ambitious climate goals, including carbon neutrality by 2050.

In addition to reducing emissions, SAF also plays a critical role in reducing the environmental impact of the aviation sector in the near term. While zero-emission aircraft are still years away from being commercially viable, SAF provides a practical solution to mitigate the sector’s impact on the climate.

The Road Ahead for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The EU’s subsidy program for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) marks a significant move towards a more sustainable future for aviation. By easing the cost burden on airlines and providing clear targets for SAF adoption, the EU is helping to accelerate the decarbonization of the aviation sector. However, the road to a sustainable aviation future is long, and more efforts are needed to scale up SAF production and reduce costs.

The current subsidy program is an important economic incentive for airline companies to adopt the use of SAF, but additional investment in production facilities, infrastructure, and technology will need to be made to establish SAF as an everyday fuel source. The support of the EU will enable the airline sector to make an actual contribution to lessening its environmental footprint and preventing climate change.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/freepik__the-style-is-candid-image-photography-with-natural__78546-1.jpeg,N,,2025-06-13 07:56:25.162615

This tender would use a double-sided auction mechanism to help scale e-SAF (sustainable aviation fuel produced from clean electricity) across Europe.

The EU has already recognised e-SAF as a key pathway to decarbonising aviation, with the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandating increasing levels of e-SAF blending starting in 2030. Despite this political momentum, none of the planned e-SAF projects in Europe have reached Final Investment Decision (FID) — even though Europe hosts around 60% of the world’s planned e-SAF capacity.

To move forward, the market needs to overcome two fundamental failures:

Producers require long-term offtake contracts to secure financing and de-risk investment.

Buyers, such as fuel suppliers and airlines, need short-term flexibility to avoid locking into high initial prices as the market matures.

A market intermediary using a double-sided auction could resolve both challenges. This intermediary would operate as a government-backed commodity trader — contracting long-term with producers to provide revenue certainty, while selling short-term to buyers to maintain flexibility.

Compared to traditional flat subsidies, this model ensures greater efficiency of public funding by minimising the cost gap through competitive pricing on both sides of the market.

But time is short. With a typical lead time of four years from FID to fuel production, projects need to secure investment by the end of 2025/26 in order to deliver fuel in line with the 2030 ReFuelEU mandate.

That’s why over 40 companies are urging EU governments to act now and co-fund a pilot e-SAF tender using this double-sided auction mechanism — and in doing so:

We have examined different ways to lower global warming over the course of the series. Over the last weeks, we have summarized what practical results we can expect from the different alternatives we have to reduce global warming from Air Transport. We looked at the following alternatives:

How do the initiatives on our lineup compare

Of the five different alternative ways to lower global warming, which is the most practical and can lead to a significant reduction in the warming effect in the short term, and which alternatives are more for the long term?

Let’s first single out the CO2 reduction ones and then compare these to the warming effect from Contrails.

The first CO2-reducing one is the one that occurs regardless of initiatives to lower emissions, the industry’s typical improvement in fuel consumption over time, Alternative 2. We can conclude that this was a powerful one, with a reduction in CO2 emissions between now and 2050 of around 600 million tonnes of CO2, compared to the scenario where there was no improvement in fuel consumption.

This shall be compared to today’s yearly emissions from Air Transport, where 300 million tonnes of Jet A1 fuel were burned during 2024, resulting in 950 million tonnes of CO2. It doesn’t mean we lower these emissions to 350 million tonnes, as we have growth in civil aviation. It means we have 600 million tonnes less of Jet A1-related CO2 emissions than we would have if there were no improvement in fuel consumption from new aircraft replacing old ones.

We shall compare this to our scenario in Alternative 1. In this scenario, we assume success in producing CO2 and NOx-emission-free airliners based on various Turboprop replacement projects. These projects can replace the existing 19, 30- to 50-seat, and 70- to 100-seat turboprops currently in the market.

We assume that the 19- and 30-to-50-seat projects will result in Entry Into Service (EIS) of aircraft from 2030. The replacement of 70 to 100-seat turboprops starts in 2040 when we assume Airbus delivers its ZEROe fuel cell-based hydrogen airliner.

In total, these projects would have reduced Jet A1 consumption between now and 2050 by 7.2 million tonnes, equivalent to approximately 23 million tonnes of CO2.

Alternative 3 involves the gradual mandating of increased SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) blends in the EU, which would result in an improvement of 106 million tonnes by 2050.

Finally, we have of the CO2 emission reducing alternatives, the effects of ETS on air transport, Alternative 4. This is more difficult to quantify, as the reductions done by individual airlines are not researched and extrapolated in a convenient manner.

We had the figure of air transport contributing 50 million tonnes of CO2 in the EU and affiliated states, and research had shown a typical 7 to 10 percent reduction from an industrial sector enrolled in the EU ETS versus not. This would then mean a three to five tonne reduction in CO2 emissions from the EU ETS for air transport.

CO2 emission reduction summary

To summarize, we have from the CO2 reduction initiative the following reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050:

We shall compare the warming reduction effects of these reductions to the effect of NOx, other sources, and avoiding warming contrails in the next Corners, as this is an analysis that requires some thought and discussion.",https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/By-Bjorn-Fehrm.png,N,,2025-06-13 07:56:36.347015

Sustainable Aviation Fuel, often lauded as the aviation industry’s silver bullet for decarbonisation, carries with it more than just the promise of cleaner skies. As airports position themselves as climate leaders, SAF emerges as both a technological hope and a strategic dilemma. The deeper question lies not in whether SAF can reduce emissions but whether its deployment justifies large-scale airport expansion.

What Makes SAF So Special?

SAF replaces conventional jet fuel with a blend derived from municipal waste, biomass, or even CO2 captured directly from the atmosphere. When used, it emits CO2—just like fossil jet fuel—but this carbon originates from sources already in the carbon cycle, thus neutral in net terms if sourced and refined responsibly.

This closed-loop concept appeals to climate regulators and aviation industry stakeholders, especially as SAF can be used with existing aircraft and airport infrastructure. It is already blended into jet fuel at major hubs and has successfully powered flights at 100 percent concentration during trials.

A Reality Check on Emissions

Despite its appeal, SAF is not a panacea. Its sustainability hinges on how it is produced. If fossil energy powers the production process or if land use changes release additional emissions, the lifecycle benefits are compromised. Moreover, current rules permit fuels to be labelled “sustainable” even if they reduce emissions by only 40 percent. In practice, blending limits (up to 50 percent with fossil jet fuel) result in flights achieving as little as 20 percent emission reductions.

Still, major policy frameworks are backing SAF. Mandates in the US, UK, and EU are targeting significant volumes by 2050. Ambitiously, SAF is expected to deliver up to 65 percent of aviation’s carbon reduction under industry net zero goals.

Why We Are Not Flying on 100 Percent SAF Yet

Cost remains a primary constraint. Even under optimistic scenarios, SAF production costs exceed fossil jet fuel by 190 to 500 percent. Technologies like direct air capture—while highly sustainable—are among the most expensive due to their energy intensity.

Moreover, feedstock limitations present a bottleneck. The most economical options like used cooking oil are finite. Scaling up SAF production will require shifting to more contentious sources, potentially disrupting food systems or increasing land-use emissions.

Scaling SAF Is Not About Parity, It Is About Prioritisation

A significant insight is that SAF will likely never reach cost parity with fossil fuels without sustained policy support. But that is not a flaw—it is a feature. SAF should be viewed not through the lens of cost parity, but as an ethical and environmental imperative.

Rather than delaying action until it becomes cheap, the challenge is to design aviation strategies that accept SAF’s higher cost as the price of climate responsibility. This repositions SAF not as a competitor to fossil fuels but as a cornerstone of responsible growth.

Does SAF Justify Airport Expansion?

Herein lies a paradox. SAF is often cited to support airport expansion, suggesting that increased capacity can be sustainable. However, even in best-case scenarios, SAF uptake will remain modest in the short term. Global SAF use was just 0.3 percent of aviation fuel in 2024. Realistically, it may only reach 6 percent by 2030 in the EU.

Furthermore, SAF does not address all climate impacts. Non-CO2 effects like nitrogen oxide emissions and contrail formation persist. While SAF may reduce contrail impacts by up to 44 percent, these benefits remain under study and are far from universal.

An Opportunity to Redefine Progress

Rather than a green light for unbounded airport expansion, SAF presents an opportunity to redefine what progress in aviation means. It calls for climate-aligned infrastructure, demand-side interventions, and strategic investments that support decarbonisation without defaulting to growth-based narratives.

Conclusion: A More Nuanced Flight Path

SAF is not a blank cheque for expansion, but a signal to invest in smarter, more sustainable aviation systems. Airports that align their development plans with realistic SAF deployment, lifecycle sustainability, and community impacts will lead the transition. In doing so, they position themselves not just as transport hubs but as leaders in climate-conscious infrastructure.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-36.svg,N,,2025-06-13 04:56:27.231179

Aviation is often portrayed as a high-emissions outlier in the global decarbonisation journey. Yet, beneath this complexity lies an accelerating shift—one aligning the skies with the goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. At the heart of this transition is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a key that not only unlocks environmental progress but also delivers economic and social value.

Beyond Emissions: SAF’s Broader Sustainability Impact

SAF is widely known for its environmental advantages—reducing lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. However, its contributions stretch far beyond climate impact. SAF is a multifaceted lever influencing several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

SDG 7 – Affordable and Clean Energy: By diversifying energy sources within aviation, SAF fosters resilience in a fuel system historically reliant on fossil fuels.

SDG 13 – Climate Action: Its use directly reduces aviation’s emissions, strengthening the industry’s commitment to climate action.

SDG 1 and 10 – No Poverty and Reduced Inequalities: SAF production, especially when rooted in agricultural or waste-based feedstocks, supports income generation in rural economies and enhances inclusivity.

The production of SAF, particularly in developing regions, can create job opportunities and infrastructure, building local capacity and promoting equitable economic growth. This less-discussed dimension reinforces SAF’s relevance not just in terms of carbon metrics but also human development.

Why Aviation Needs a Unique Approach

While other transport sectors embrace electrification with relative ease, aviation operates under very different constraints. Aircraft demand high energy density and light-weight fuel solutions for long-haul travel—making batteries and hydrogen impractical in the near term.

A comparative glance at the feasibility of electrification across sectors reveals aviation’s limited flexibility:

This reinforces the indispensable role of SAF in aviation’s decarbonisation—providing a viable, drop-in solution that integrates seamlessly with current aircraft and airport infrastructure.

Decoding SAF’s Technical and Economic Profile

To fully appreciate SAF’s potential, it helps to compare its characteristics with conventional jet fuel:

Despite its cost premium, SAF presents a long-term value proposition. It can reduce particulate pollution and requires no modification to existing aircraft, reducing adoption friction and retrofitting costs.

The Role of Policy and Investment

For SAF to achieve scale, coordinated policies and robust financial support are essential:

Mandates: Europe’s ReFuelEU and the UK’s SAF Mandate are already setting required SAF blending targets, gradually increasing through 2050.

Incentives: The United States has introduced SAF-specific tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act to boost production economics.

Global Momentum and Strategic Investments

Worldwide, governments and aviation players are investing in SAF projects that are not only technologically promising but also strategically significant:

UAE: Collaboration between Cepsa and Etihad to accelerate local SAF research and production.

Australia: Qantas and Ampol’s 1.7 million-liter SAF import—a national milestone.

Japan: Strategic pivot by Eneos Holdings toward SAF as a primary decarbonisation tool.

Brazil: $1 billion investment by Envision Energy to produce SAF from sugarcane.

USA: United Airlines backing carbon capture startups and SAF technologies.

Spain: Cepsa’s SAF supply rollout across major national airports.

These initiatives highlight the growing consensus that SAF is not a temporary fix but a foundational element in aviation’s sustainability strategy.

Conclusion: Fueling a Broader Transformation

The true power of SAF lies not only in its carbon reduction potential but also in its alignment with broader societal goals. It is a solution that merges technological feasibility with global equity, climate ambition with economic opportunity.

As the aviation sector steers toward a decarbonised horizon, SAF serves as more than just a cleaner fuel—it represents a new operating model where environmental integrity and human development fly in tandem.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-35.svg,N,,2025-06-13 05:57:01.513190

Remarkably, this number is equivalent to the current emissions of the United States sourcing from international operations alone.
Within the total share of emissions projected for the Indian aviation industry in 2035, 24.4% (around 12.2 million tonne) will come from international operations.
The cost can impose a constraint on the growth of international operations for Indian carriers and aviation industry, unless suitably moderated or addressed.
It is important for the stakeholders of the aviation industry to urgently evolve solutions to the impending freeze on their growing emissions (compared with 2019).","The Indian aviation market is on a high growth trajectory. This growth will eventually lead to a significant environmental challenge, the most important being the increase in GHG emissions. Based on the current emissions, India’s airline industry is projected to emit around 50 million tonne of CO2 in 2035 (domestic and international) at 5% annual emissions growth rate. Remarkably, this number is equivalent to the current emissions of the United States sourcing from international operations alone. Within the total share of emissions projected for the Indian aviation industry in 2035, 24.4% (around 12.2 million tonne) will come from international operations. This sector has been experiencing an explosive growth in the country, providing huge market potential and opportunities for new entrants. However, with the onset of ICAO’s CORSIA, there can be adverse fallout on the growth of the international component of the existing and new carriers. Based on the current analysis, it is estimated that in the second phase, CORSIA would impose high financial costs on Indian carriers,e.g. Air India, Indigo and SpiceJet, which have international operations. The costs in terms of offsets for the three operators could vary in the range of INR 1998 to 10018 crore1 (on average INR 666 and 3334 crore per annum at USD10 and USD50 price unit) between 2025 and 2037if 5% growth rate in emissions takes place. If the operations grow and emissions increase at 8% per annum, the offset costs could range from INR 3592 to 18009 crore2 (on average INR 1197 and 6003 crore per annum at USD10 and USD50 price unit)between 2025 and 2037 for all the airlines put together.

The cost can impose a constraint on the growth of international operations for Indian carriers and aviation industry, unless suitably moderated or addressed. As the progress to reduce emissions globally is slow, the cost of mitigating global emissions from the aviation sector is anticipated to be high. To overcome these challenges and reduce the financial burden, the Indian aviation industry will have to rely on the options of offsetting the emissions in the domestic or international carbon market, and/or promoting the use of biofuels or low carbon fuels.

It is important for the stakeholders of the aviation industry to urgently evolve solutions to the impending freeze on their growing emissions (compared with 2019). Amongst the possible actions is a range of measures covering improvements in energy efficiency, fuel efficiency, and switch to alternative fuels. While many of these are already part of a Whitepaper on National Green Aviation Policy, the new interventions could include creation of a market trading facility in emissions, and increased use of low carbon sustainable aviation fuels.

Emissions reduction credits generated in other sectors of economy can be made available to the operators. The existing domestic energy related markets in India can become the starting point for the development of a domestic emissions trading system if the relevant regulations are tweaked. Further, the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) can help the industry meet a substantial part of its fuel need if adequate policy initiatives are taken in time. SAF will require ramping up of efforts for its production and commercialization and making it available on scale to the Indian airline operators to enable them to reduce or offset their emissions in the second phase of the CORSIA (2027–2035).

The government needs to prepare a clear action plan to identify and roll out these measures with a view to prepare the industry to meet the emerging challenge sufficiently and adequately before 2025.",https://www.teriin.org/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-13 02:56:29.630058

Founded four years ago by CEO Ed Mason, Jet Zero Australia is dedicated to the development and operation of large-scale sustainable aviation fuel [SAF] projects.
Irvine said that this project uses ATJ technology supplied by LanzaJet to convert ethanol into low carbon jet fuel and renewable diesel.
“Around 90 per cent of what is produced from Project Ulysses is SAF, and 10 per cent is renewable diesel.
Both outputs of the company – SAF and renewable diesel – will be tested and certified to globally recognised standards.","Manufacturer Monthly’s Jack Lloyd sat down with Jet Zero CFO, Mac Irvine, to discuss the company’s sustainable aviation fuel projects, which utilise renewable feedstocks to produce low carbon liquid fuels.

Founded four years ago by CEO Ed Mason, Jet Zero Australia is dedicated to the development and operation of large-scale sustainable aviation fuel [SAF] projects. These projects aim to decarbonise aviation, improve sovereign fuel security and bring a new and diverse industry to regional Australia.

The idea for Jet Zero began with Mason’s previous work in equity capital markets in the mining, resources, oil and gas sectors. In this previous employment, he witnessed numerous clients – in what are traditionally non-renewable sectors – begin to ask about decarbonising their operations.

This motivated Mason to think about solutions to a hard-to-abate industry, which ended up being aviation fuel production. Beginning as a part-time operation, in the past three years the company has become a full-time business, growing from strength to strength.

Jet Zero CFO Mac Irvine joined the company from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation [CEFC], the Australian green bank, in early 2024. It was a high-profile appointment which spoke to the success and ambition of the company as a commercially-minded developer of SAF projects.

“We are looking to decarbonise the aviation sector, but at the same time, support the agricultural sector and the regional communities where these projects are most likely to be developed and built,” said Irvine. “Jet Zero started four years ago and has developed into what I personally believe is the market-leading private sector developer in the SAF space.

“We are technology agnostic and deliver our projects with a commercial mindset. This means we can procure any technology from the marketplace, but importantly we focus on proven and scaled technologies.

“This approach has led us to pursue the Alcohol to Jet (ATJ) and Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathways.”

A sustainable pipeline of projects

Currently, Jet Zero has two major projects that have been announced. The flagship project, which is currently in Front-End Engineering Design [FEED], is Project Ulysses. Irvine said that this project uses ATJ technology supplied by LanzaJet to convert ethanol into low carbon jet fuel and renewable diesel.

“Around 90 per cent of what is produced from Project Ulysses is SAF, and 10 per cent is renewable diesel. That’s just how the technology works in practice,” said Irvine. “It’s about decarbonising the aviation sector and looking to keep the fuel onshore.”

For Ulysses, Jet Zero has secured a site at the Cleveland Bay Industrial Park in Townsville, North Queensland. The project is set to produce approximately 102 million litres of SAF and 11 million litres of renewable diesel per annum.

“The project will have 1,000 jobs at peak construction and for longer-term operations, about 100 direct operational jobs as well,” said Irvine.

Irvine said that the project’s progress wouldn’t be possible without $50 million of funding – from both private and public sector – that Jet Zero has raised to date. Of this $50 million, he said that around $35 million comes from within the private sector.

“The private investment comes from our three strategic partners – Airbus, Qantas, and Idemitsu Kosan of Japan – as well as five other institutional funds,” he said.

Aside from private sector investment, the Queensland State and Commonwealth Government have jointly committed almost $15 million. Irvine said this is the biggest amount ever awarded by the Government to advance a single SAF project.

“Project Ulysses’ FEED phase saw $9 million in funding from the Commonwealth Government via the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and $5 million from the Queensland

Government,” he said. “There was also about $760,000 from the Queensland Government for its feasibility phase.”

With the first SAF estimated to be produced in 2028, Irvine said that the company is looking to close the FEED phase of Ulysses by the end of the year and begin construction shortly after.

While Ulysses is the company’s primary focus, Jet Zero and global biofuels player Apeiron Bioenergy have partnered on Project Mandala. This project will focus on sourcing waste oils and non-edible feedstocks to manufacture SAF via the HEFA pathway. The Project is nearing completion of its feasibility phase.

“We received grant funding for Mandala from the Go-Green Co-Innovation Program, which is an initiative between Enterprise Singapore and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT),” said Irvine.

Maintaining capability to ensure future quality

Irvine insists that it’s Jet Zero’s capabilities across development, engineering, operations and financing that have led them to become Australia’s leading SAF project developer.

“Our team has a really strong, broad skill set that allows us to put all of the component parts of a project together efficiently and commercially,” he said.

On top of its current team of 12, Irvine said that Jet Zero also has external partners that are working for and supporting the company on its mission. This includes Technip Energies as design and engineering contractor and Long Energy and Resources as owner’s engineer.

An equally important aspect of capability within Jet Zero is how the company plans to ensure the quality control and assurance of its products. Both outputs of the company – SAF and renewable diesel – will be tested and certified to globally recognised standards.

“We refer to this as ‘farm to wing’ – in other words, from beginning to end,” said Irvine.

To ensure these standards and specifications are met, Jet Zero has an external third-party provider working with it on its life cycle assessment [LCA].

“These certification bodies want to make sure that the fuel is produced within a sustainable supply chain,” said Irvine. “We will support the sustainability of that supply chain as well as reduce carbon emissions across that life cycle to ensure that we have a sustainable and validated product.”

Overcoming past challenges to create success

Irvine said that challenges have presented themselves across each part of the process, as trying to develop a project in a new industry regardless of location is never going to be easy. He said that overcoming these challenges in the past, present and future isn’t a solo adventure, but instead a challenge taken on by industry.

“Our commercially driven nature has really enabled us to help us break through a lot of the barriers that other projects wouldn’t have.”

Taking this attitude into the future is key for Jet Zero, and key to the company’s near term goal of completing the FEED program on Project Ulysses and targeting Final Investment Decision [FID] by the end of this year. For Mandala, Irvine said that the near term goal is closing out the feasibility study within the next three months.

“Mandala is the second most progressed project in our portfolio and allows the business to diversify across technology and feedstocks,” said Irvine.

He also said the company has unannounced projects in the pipeline that will help Jet Zero achieve their eventual goal of having a portfolio of global projects.

“We are continuing to develop those projects through feasibility and the early scoping stage in the immediate term,” Irvine said. “Long term, the goal is to have a platform of projects that are operating and producing significant volumes of SAF globally.”",https://www.manmonthly.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/New-Header-image-copy.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 00:56:27.790421

The EU requires 2% of fuel made available at EU airports to be SAF in 2025, rising to 6% in 2030.
Airlines must buy permits from the EU carbon market to cover their emissions from European flights.
Until last year, the EU gave airlines most permits free of charge, but it is now phasing out free permits to drive faster emissions reductions.","The European Union has offered to subsidize airline purchases of more than 200 million litres of sustainable aviation fuels to encourage carriers to swap kerosene for cleaner alternatives, Reuters calculations show.

The calculations, based on European Commission data, suggest that the subsidies could trigger a significant boost to airline demand for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), given the volume equates to about 15% of global SAF production.

Global SAF output last year totaled 1.3 billion liters, according to airline industry association IATA.

The EU has earmarked revenue from the sale of 20 million carbon emissions permits to help airlines to cover the price gap between conventional kerosene and more expensive SAF on flights within Europe.

Reuters calculations showed these subsidies would cover purchases of up to 216 million liters of e-fuels - synthetic fuels made using captured CO2 emissions - or as much as 2.6 billion litres of biofuels.

The EU subsidies cover up to 6 euros per litre for e-fuels and 0.5 euros per liter for biofuels.

Aviation is among the hardest sectors to decarbonize, with zero-emission aircraft not expected this decade.

Sustainable fuels, which have net-zero emissions or lower emissions than fossil fuel kerosene, can help to reduce air travel's carbon footprint in the near term. However, SAF costs three to five times more than traditional jet fuel and makes up only 0.3% of global jet fuel supply.

Airlines have warned that EU targets to use more SAF are therefore impossible to meet, though a Boston Consulting Group report this year found that the sector is investing only 1%-3% of revenue or budget allocation in SAF.

The EU requires 2% of fuel made available at EU airports to be SAF in 2025, rising to 6% in 2030.

Airlines must buy permits from the EU carbon market to cover their emissions from European flights. Until last year, the EU gave airlines most permits free of charge, but it is now phasing out free permits to drive faster emissions reductions.

Initially, Montana Renewables attempted to qualify the entire biorefinery, valued at $562 million, as tax-exempt under the pollution control equipment benefit.
Montana Renewables appealed and maintained that the entire operation is “one emissions-reducing unit.” Following the settlement, Montana Renewables dropped its appeal.
The company is going through its second multi-year tax protest since 2017 and has three pending cases before the Montana Tax Appeal Board.","A state board has nearly tripled the amount of equipment eligible for a tax exemption at the Montana Renewables biorefinery in Great Falls and left the door open for additional exemptions in the future.

The company, a subsidiary of Calumet, reached a settlement with the Montana Tax Appeal Board in May. Montana Renewables had appealed a prior determination by the Montana Department of Environmental Quality that $24.5 million in assets qualified for a tax exemption as “pollution control equipment.”

The terms of the settlement, released through a public information request by Montana Free Press, show that an additional $42.9 million in equipment will be eligible for the tax exemption. In total, Montana Renewables will not pay property taxes on $67.4 million worth of assets at the plant.

The exemption is retroactive to December 2022. The settlement also stipulates that the exemption applies to current assets only and that “nothing in this settlement agreement shall prevent MRL [Montana Renewables] from seeking pollution control equipment certifications for new assets” in the future.

Initially, Montana Renewables attempted to qualify the entire biorefinery, valued at $562 million, as tax-exempt under the pollution control equipment benefit. The exemption is aimed at “portions” of equipment or machinery that prevent the creation of air or water pollutants, according to Montana law.

The exemption request applied to the future expansion of the biorefinery, which is estimated to be finished by late 2027.

The DEQ rejected the request for a full tax exemption and identified specific equipment that controls or reduces emissions at the plant. The agency determined that the eligible equipment amounted to $24,579,241. Montana Renewables appealed and maintained that the entire operation is “one emissions-reducing unit.” Following the settlement, Montana Renewables dropped its appeal.

Montana Renewables did not return a request for comment Thursday.

Calumet launched Montana Renewables in 2021 to operate within the footprint of the Great Falls oil refinery. The biorefinery uses agriculturally based raw materials like canola oil and soybean oil to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel. Last year, the U.S. Department of Energy announced a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to Montana Renewables to fund an expansion that will more than double the plant’s output.

Sustainable aviation fuel produces less pollution than conventional jet fuel. However, some researchers have questioned the environmental benefits of fuels derived from agriculture, taking into account the land use and production impacts.

Projections submitted by Montana Renewables suggest that the fully expanded plant could emit more pollutants than the plant did as a dedicated crude oil refinery.

The Calumet crude oil refinery continues to operate, though it has scaled down production to make room for Montana Renewables. Total greenhouse gas emissions at the entire Great Falls site were 427,371 tons in 2023, the highest amount in EPA’s published data for the location since 2010.

It’s not yet clear exactly how much this will impact the company’s property tax liability. The Montana Department of Revenue must apply multiple tax benefits to the site. Those include a 50% tax break on a portion of the plant from the city of Great Falls and a 50% break on the entire plant from Cascade County, both of which apply to Montana Renewables. The company also applied for a 50% tax break through a state-level energy production benefit that’s still under review.

This latest settlement will be worked into those calculations. A spokesperson for the Department of Revenue didn’t return a question about how the exemption would be applied. The two companies are among the largest taxpayers in Cascade County.

Calumet, which is taxed separately for the crude oil refinery operation, is subject to an 80% tax break on $6.1 million in equipment. The company is going through its second multi-year tax protest since 2017 and has three pending cases before the Montana Tax Appeal Board.

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), a senior member and former chairman of the committee, questioned Department of the Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the importance of finalizing trade deals to provide certainty and the need for Treasury to work with Congress and farmer-led organizations to get 45Z regulations right for farmers. Grassley also talked about the importance of extending the 2017 Trump Tax Cuts for the middle-class and strengthening the pro-growth reforms that incentivize business investment.

Video and excerpts from Grassley’s questions follow.

VIDEO

On Trade Certainty:

“I’ve made clear that I support President Trump’s goals of getting better trade deals for U.S. producers. I’ve heard from many industries and businesses in Iowa. Each one of them [is] in a very unique position due to the tariffs, but all express one common concern – and that’s the need for certainty around trade.

“I’ve spoken with several Trump administration officials and nominees about the importance of finalizing two or three deals to provide some certainty around trade. So, would you agree that trade deals need some certainty and that at the same time, provide fair market access for U.S. goods would benefit the economy and provide much needed markets?”

On 45Z Regulations and Farmers:

“The Senate Finance Committee has been working on what will soon be the 45Z Clean Fuels Production Tax Credit. Implementing this credit properly is important for the biofuels industry and especially for farmers.

“The Biden administration failed to meaningfully address 45Z regulations. They put some out for comment, but not much beyond that. But the regulations it released for the 40B Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) credit demonstrated that Treasury officials in that administration knew nothing about farming.

“Prior to issuing rules governing 45Z, we need everyone in the Trump administration to take some time to learn a thing or two about how farming works. So, this is kind of a question of working ahead, looking after the president signs this bill, and regulations are going to be written on 45Z. Would you be willing to work with congressional colleagues, farmer-led organizations and even this senator to make sure that we get regulations under 45Z that work for farmers?”

Extending 2017 Trump Tax Cuts:

“The 2017 tax law provided tax relief across all incomes with a focus on the middle-class. Just as important, the law included pro-growth reforms to incentivize business investment, boosting production and leading to higher wages.

In 2022, IATA launched CO2 Connect, a powerful tool to support aviation’s decarbonization, driven by global standard methodologies and high-quality data.
How important is the data from CO2 Connect in providing an accurate, credible picture of CO2 emission reductions across the aviation industry?
Is your airline providing or considering using CO2 Connect to provide visibility of the carbon footprint to your flying passengers or corporate clients?
“Yes, we plan to soon integrate CO2 Connect across all our customer segments—flying passengers, corporate clients, and cargo—to enhance environmental transparency.","To meet the aviation industry’s ambitious goal of net-zero CO2 by 2050, airlines are investing in decarbonization measures such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), more efficient aircraft and operational efficiencies. But you cannot manage what you don’t measure. Therefore, a vital consideration is the transparent and accurate provision of CO2 emissions data from flights, for both passengers and cargo.

In 2022, IATA launched CO2 Connect, a powerful tool to support aviation’s decarbonization, driven by global standard methodologies and high-quality data. With the contribution of more than 70 airlines today, the tool has been established as the benchmark for measuring aviation emissions globally.

French airlines are among the key players leading the way. We spoke to three airlines—Corsair, Air Corsica and ASL Airlines France—that have recently joined the CO2 Connect program to understand how the tool is helping them.

The EU, including France, has implementednumerous regulations to reduce CO2 emissions from air transport. What does it mean for your airline?

Marie Antoinette Santoni, VP Network, ESG and Communications at Air Corsica notes that the airline industry’s commitment to net-zero, together with regulations introduced by the EU, requires the airline to rethink its operations to reduce its carbon footprint. “This means investing in a newer fleet of aircraft—with 85% of the fleet renewed, we have seen a 16% reduction in CO2 emissions—cleaner technologies and optimizing our routes to consume less fuel and reduce our CO2 emissions.”

“For the moment, it means additional costs, charges and taxes. SAF, which is a solution, is not available in the market and is too expensive. And the ReFuelEU anti-tankering provisions are unfairly onerous and costly to airlines serving smaller regional airports across Europe,” says Captain Nicolas Redier, Flight Ops Director at ASL Airlines France.

“The growing body of European regulations reflects a strong commitment to transformation, but their implementation poses significant operational and economic challenges for our sector,” says Cyrille Digon, Director of Flight Support and CSR at Corsair.

But overall, the airlines are firmly committed to reducing their environmental impact and complying with the regulations, says Santoni.

How important is the data from CO2 Connect in providing an accurate, credible picture of CO2 emission reductions across the aviation industry?

“CO2 Connect, using the IATA methodology, provides standardized, verifiable, and comparable data. Contributing our data is part of our commitment to reducing the overall emissions from aviation,” says Digon.

Captain Redier from ASL Airlines France, highlights that CO2 emission reduction is a commitment for the whole aviation industry. “CO2 Connect is a common tool for a common target. Working together in the same direction makes our efforts more efficient and accurate.”

“The data provided by CO2 Connect, in accordance with the IATA methodology, is essential for establishing an accurate and credible picture of our emissions reduction efforts. It not only allows us to track our progress, but also enables us to communicate transparently with our customers and partners about our environmental impact,” says Air Corsica’s Santoni.

Is your airline providing or considering using CO2 Connect to provide visibility of the carbon footprint to your flying passengers or corporate clients?

“Yes, we plan to soon integrate CO2 Connect across all our customer segments—flying passengers, corporate clients, and cargo—to enhance environmental transparency. Our intention is to make it available directly on our website, allowing customers to easily access and monitor their carbon footprint,” says Digon.

Santoni notes that Air Corsica recognizes the importance of transparency regarding its carbon footprint. “We are currently considering integrating CO2 Connect into our services to provide our passengers and business customers with clear visibility into the emissions associated with their travel. This could help them make more informed decisions when choosing more sustainable flight options.”

How important is the ability for CO2 Connect to account for SAF in the emissions calculations?

“It is a key driver,” says Digon, “Alongside fleet modernization, to achieve net-zero objectives. The increasing use of SAF, and soon e-SAF, must be properly reflected and valued in emissions accounting methodologies.”

“SAF represents a tangible solution for reducing CO2 emissions from aviation. The inclusion of SAF in CO2 Connect emissions calculations is crucial to achieving our net-zero targets. We are closely monitoring technological developments and hope that the production of these new fuels will enable us to increasingly integrate them into our consumption,” says Santoni at Air Corsica.",https://www.iata.org/contentassets/5a66352875d14648ace7630457924ba7/gettyimages-1331820787-1200x800-6a45073.jpeg,N,,2025-06-12 21:01:19.211270

SAF is currently several times more expensive than traditional aircraft fuel, and it is less readily available.
In 2024, Airbus made two investments: Airbus invested in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Financing Alliance investment fund (SAFFA).","Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is a synthetic fuel which can reduce aircraft emissions by up to 80% across the lifecycle.

Today, all Airbus aircraft are capable of flying on a maximum 50% blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and conventional fuel. By 2030, all Airbus aircraft and helicopters will be capable of flying with up to 100% SAF. Our next-generation single aisle aircraft is being designed with SAF compatibility in mind.

SAF is one of the key ways that the aviation industry can reduce emissions, and could contribute more than 50% of the aviation industry’s carbon dioxide emissions reduction according to ATAG’s “Scenario 3”. However, encouraging airlines and operators to switch from fossil-based fuels like kerosene is a challenge. SAF is currently several times more expensive than traditional aircraft fuel, and it is less readily available.

Airbus agrees that SAF will be an important way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and is positioning itself as a catalyst in the ecosystem to promote SAF production and uptake by deploying SAF in its own operations, by forming cross-industry partnerships, and by making strategic investments.

What is SAF?

Airbus believes that scaling the SAF ecosystem isn’t possible without collaboration from different partners including airlines and operators. For this reason, Airbus has partnered with several airlines to trial the use of SAF in their operations.

Two pilot schemes launched in 2024 were:

Airbus partnered with easyJet to launch a pilot scheme on the Toulouse-Bristol route. Airbus financed 106 tonnes of SAF, the equivalent amount of fuel necessary to run flights between Toulouse and Bristol on a 30% SAF blend during the three month trial period. The trial aimed to act as a proof of concept, demonstrating how airlines and corporate organisations can share the cost of SAF in a mutually beneficial way, ultimately creating additional supply and demand for SAF.

Airbus provided technical guidance and expertise to WizzAir during a SAF operational trial where WizzAir operated more than 50 flights using a blend of SAF and traditional jet fuel.

During the WizzAir trial, a passenger survey was also launched, emphasising the importance of understanding how travellers feel about low-carbon aviation, and whether they would be willing to pay extra to reduce the emissions on their flights.

In terms of partnerships that support the use of SAF in its own operations, Airbus has a long-standing relationship with TotalEnergies, who have been providing SAF for aircraft deliveries in Toulouse since 2016. Since 2024, TotalEnergies supply enough SAF to meet more than half Airbus’ needs in Europe, and the two companies also have a shared research programme that is working on the transition to 100% SAF capability.

In recent years, Airbus has also signed MOUs with Neste – to jointly advance the production and uptake of SAF – and with OMV – to explore joint solutions that broaden access to SAF for various customer groups, stimulating new demand and supporting investments in new SAF production facilities.

In 2024, Airbus made two investments:

Airbus invested in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Financing Alliance investment fund (SAFFA). SAFFA makes investments that support the production of SAF that is eligible for RefuelEU Aviation or CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) certification.

Airbus invested in SAF producer and technology company LanzaJet. LanzaJet will use the investment to scale their SAF production which uses the Alcohol-to-Jet pathway.

In 2022 and 2023, Airbus made a number of investments alongside Qantas. In 2022, Airbus and Qantas agreed to invest up to $200 million to develop the SAF industry in Australia. In 2023, Airbus and Qantas, alongside the Queensland Government, invested in a Queensland biofuel facility being developed by Jet Zero Australia in partnership with LanzaJet. These investments seek to address the availability of SAF in Australia, improving accessibility to SAF for airlines and operators who want to use it.

To further address the challenge of accessibility, Airbus has launched a “Book and Claim” demonstrator. This initiative aims to boost both supply and demand for SAF worldwide, providing a flexible and scalable solution to accelerate SAF adoption.

In simple terms, the book and claim approach allows a buyer to “book” a certain amount of SAF and “claim” the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere. This system will improve SAF accessibility for potential customers, particularly those located far from supply points or production facilities.

As a facilitator, Airbus purchases SAF certificates and manages the associated sustainability attributes through the registry of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), a recognised sustainability certification body. These certificates will then be resold to interested customers, such as aircraft and helicopter operators, thereby stimulating short-term demand for SAF.

https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy19osti/72590.pdf FAQ What are Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs)?","Latest Developments in Sustainable Aviation Fuels

The aviation industry is under increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, and Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) are being touted as a key solution. SAFs are fuels that are made from renewable resources, such as biomass, waste, or algae, and can be used to power aircraft. In recent years, there have been significant developments in the production and certification of SAFs, which are bringing the industry closer to a more sustainable future.

New Feedstocks and Conversion Technologies

One of the key challenges in the production of SAFs is the availability of suitable feedstocks. Traditional feedstocks, such as corn and sugarcane, have been criticized for their impact on food prices and land use. As a result, researchers have been exploring new feedstocks, such as agricultural waste, forestry residues, and algae. These feedstocks offer a number of advantages, including lower costs and reduced environmental impacts. For example, a study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that agricultural waste could be used to produce up to 4.8 billion gallons of SAF per year in the United States alone 1. Similarly, a report by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) found that forestry residues could be used to produce up to 10% of the world's SAF needs by 2030 2. In addition to new feedstocks, researchers have also been developing new conversion technologies that can be used to produce SAFs. These technologies include advanced fermentation, gasification, and hydroprocessing. For example, a company called LanzaJet is developing a technology that uses fermentation to convert biomass into a jet fuel that is compatible with existing aircraft engines 3.

Advances in SAF Production and Certification

In recent years, there have been significant advances in the production and certification of SAFs. A number of companies, including Neste, Boeing, and Shell, have developed commercial-scale SAF production facilities. For example, Neste's Singapore refinery is capable of producing up to 1 million tons of SAF per year 4. The certification of SAFs is also becoming more streamlined. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has developed a number of standards for SAFs, including ASTM D7566, which covers the specification for aviation turbine fuel containing synthesized hydrocarbons 5. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has also developed guidelines for the use of SAFs, including a CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) methodology for calculating the emissions reductions from SAFs 6.

Industry Partnerships and Collaborations

The development and deployment of SAFs is a complex task that requires collaboration across the aviation industry. A number of partnerships and collaborations have been formed to support the development of SAFs, including the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group, which is a coalition of airlines, airports, and other industry stakeholders that are working together to promote the use of SAFs 7. Other examples of industry partnerships include the collaboration between Boeing and Neste to develop a commercial-scale SAF production facility in Finland 8, and the partnership between Shell and SkyNRG to develop a SAF supply chain in Europe 9.

Commercializing Sustainable Aviation Fuels

While there have been significant advances in the production and certification of SAFs, there are still a number of challenges that need to be overcome before they can be widely adopted. One of the key challenges is the cost of production, which is currently higher than traditional fossil fuels. However, a number of companies are working to reduce the cost of SAF production through economies of scale and improvements in efficiency.

Progress Towards Commercial-Scale Production

A number of companies are making progress towards commercial-scale SAF production. For example, Neste is planning to expand its SAF production capacity to 1.5 million tons per year by 2023 10. Similarly, LanzaTech is developing a commercial-scale SAF production facility in the United States that is expected to produce up to 100 million gallons of SAF per year 11.

Challenges and Opportunities for Industry Stakeholders

The commercialization of SAFs presents a number of challenges and opportunities for industry stakeholders. One of the key challenges is the need for significant investment in infrastructure, including production facilities, storage tanks, and distribution networks. However, this also presents an opportunity for companies to develop new business models and revenue streams. For example, a report by the International Council on Clean Transportation found that the adoption of SAFs could create up to 22,000 new jobs in the United States by 2035 12. Similarly, a study by the European Commission found that the adoption of SAFs could generate up to €4.3 billion in economic benefits for the European Union by 2030 13.

Role of Policy and Regulation in Supporting SAF Adoption

Policy and regulation will play a critical role in supporting the adoption of SAFs. Governments can provide incentives, such as tax credits or subsidies, to support the development and deployment of SAFs. For example, the United States has a tax credit of up to $1.50 per gallon for SAFs that meet certain criteria 14. Regulators can also play a role in supporting the adoption of SAFs by developing standards and guidelines for their use. For example, the European Union has developed a number of regulations and guidelines for the use of SAFs, including a requirement that all aviation fuels sold in the EU contain at least 2% SAF by 2030 15.

The Road to a Sustainable Aviation Future

The adoption of SAFs has the potential to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the aviation industry. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAFs could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by up to 80% by 2050 16.

Potential Emissions Reductions from SAF Adoption

The potential emissions reductions from SAF adoption are significant. According to a study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the use of SAFs could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by up to 75% by 2050 17.

Industry Targets and Timelines for SAF Deployment

The aviation industry has set a number of targets and timelines for SAF deployment. For example, IATA has set a target of 2% SAF adoption by 2025, and 32% by 2035 18. Similarly, the European Union has set a target of at least 32% of aviation fuels being SAF by 2035 19.

Opportunities for Innovation and Growth in the SAF Sector

The adoption of SAFs presents a number of opportunities for innovation and growth in the SAF sector. For example, companies are developing new technologies and business models to support the production and deployment of SAFs. According to a report by the International Energy Agency, the global SAF market could be worth up to $150 billion by 2050 20. The development of new feedstocks and conversion technologies is also expected to drive innovation and growth in the SAF sector. For example, the use of algae as a feedstock for SAF production is expected to become increasingly important in the coming years 21.

\text{Emissions reductions} = \frac{\text{SAF adoption rate} \times \text{emissions reduction per gallon}}{\text{total aviation fuel consumption}}

Conclusion

The future of bioenergy in aviation is looking increasingly promising, with significant advances being made in the production and certification of SAFs. While there are still challenges to be overcome, the potential emissions reductions from SAF adoption are significant, and the industry is working towards a more sustainable future.
