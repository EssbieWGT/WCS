The event will be hosted by Cathay Pacific and will bring together leading organisations across the aviation, energy, finance, and policy sectors in Hong Kong to progress aviation sustainability.

IATA’s World Sustainability Symposium 2025

This year’s World Sustainability Symposium (WSS) will be held in Hong Kong and hosted by Cathay Pacific. The Symposium is IATA’s flagship event on aviation sustainability, set to welcome over 500 organisations from around the world to advance the industry’s aim of achieving net zero CO₂ emissions by 2050. Airlines, fuel producers, investors, policymakers, and innovators will all be in attendance at the WSS, encouraging greater discussion and collaboration between sectors.

Taking place on 21-22 October, the Symposium will follow the 42nd ICAO Assembly, which will call for stronger government policy to support the industry’s transition to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The WSS also precedes COP30 – the United Nations Climate Change Conference that seeks to boost climate action. Bridging these two significant events, the WSS will focus on removing obstacles to SAF production expansion, attracting financing for decarbonisation costs, integrating emerging technology developments, and increasing collaboration.

Willie Walsh – Director General of IATA – has highlighted the importance of the WSS and what it can do for the future of sustainable aviation:

“We are at a crucial point. Airlines are fully committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. But we have not seen sufficient, timely action by policymakers, aerospace manufacturers, oil companies, or fuel producers to support this commitment. This event is an essential rallying call for all those who have a stake in air transport’s future to overcome any challenges in the way of accelerating the pace of this crucial energy transition.”

The symposium will feature speeches and conversations from:

Ronald Lam, Chief Executive Officer of the Cathay Group

Mable Chan, Secretary of Transport & Logistics for the Hong Kong SAR Government

Patrick Healy, Chair of the Cathay Group

Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA

Dr Jun Ma, Chairman & President of Hong Kong Green Finance Association

Dr Fabiano Piccino, Air Logistics Global Head of Sustainability at Kuehne+Nagel

Jouk Boeye, Managing Director Corporate Sourcing, Supply Chain Sustainability & Net Zero Operations at HSBC

Christopher AU, Director of the Asia Pacific Climate Risk Centre of WTW

Ayesha Choudhury, Chief Commercial Officer at Infinium

Lam has also commented:

“As the IATA World Sustainability Symposium lands in Asia for the first time, we are honored that Hong Kong has been selected as the location and Cathay Pacific as the host airline. Collaboration across multiple sectors and regulators is essential for aviation to achieve its decarbonization goals, and gatherings like this provide a valuable platform for leading voices to come together to drive meaningful change. Such cooperation is especially important as the industry works to develop the ecosystem of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with Hong Kong having the potential to become one of Asia’s major centers for SAF in the future.”

Aemetis Inc. released second quarter results, reporting increase revenue when compared to the first quarter of the year. During an earnings call, company officials detailed progress with the company’s dairy renewable natural gas (RNG), ethanol, biodiesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) projects.

Todd Waltz, chief financial officer at Aemetis, said the company’s ethanol plant in Keyes, California, operated at a slightly reduced rate of 13.8 million gallons during the quarter to maximize margins.

Aemetis Executive Chairman and CEO Eric McAfee said progress is being made on the mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) project underway at the Keyes plant. Key vendors are fabricating equipment for the system, he said, noting the MVR project is expected to reduce the plant’s natural gas use by 80%. The system is expected to be fully operational next year.

McAfee also noted that ethanol pricing has improved since earlier this year. He cited the U.S. EPA’s emergency waivers for E15 and lower corn prices as factors that have improved margins. While Aemetis decreased ethanol production during the spring to optimize margins, McAfee said the company has recently increased production to support market demand and participate in the higher-margin environment.

According to Waltz, Aemetis’s dairy RNG operations recognized $3.1 million of revenue from 11 operating digesters during the second quarter, suing the California Air Resources Board-approved Low Carbon Fuel Standard pathway for seven of the digesters.

McAfee said the RNG business is steadily scaling up, with a new multi-dairy digester coming online this month that is expected to boost RNG production by 30%. He said the company plans to reach 550,000 MMBtus of RNG production capacity this year, increasing to 1 million MMBtu by the end of next year.

Regarding Aemetis’ Riverbank project, a proposed 90 MMgy SAF and renewable diesel facility, McAfee confirmed the company has received the authority to construct air permits and conditional use permit for the project. He said the company is in active discussions on financing structure and is waiting further clarity on the 45Z production tax credit and Renewable Fuels Standard mandates to support project financing.

Aemetis is also planning to develop a CCS project at the site of the Riverbank facility. McAfee said initial site work is complete on a geologic characterization well. Data obtained from the next phase will support the company’s Class VI permit application with the U.S. EPA. Once permitting, the site is expected to have the capacity to sequester up to 1.4 million metric tons of CO2 annually.

Aemetis also has an India-based biodiesel business. That subsidiary is targeting a public listing in early 2026.

Aemetis reported second quarter revenues of $52.2 million, down from $66.6 million reported for the same period of last year. The dairy RNG segment produced 106,400 MMBtu and reported $3.1 million in revenue. The India biodiesel business recognized $11.9 million in revenue.

Gross loss for the second quarter was $3.4 million, compared to a $1.8 million gross loss reported for the same period of 2024. Operating loss was $10.7 million, compared to an operating loss of $13.6 million. Net loss was $23.4 million, compared to a net loss of $29.2 million.

The airline has stated that it will continue to pursue sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as a key part of its decarbonization strategy, with a goal of powering at least 10% of its flights with SAF by 2030. The sale is expected to help Southwest achieve this goal while also generating revenue for the airline. Conestoga Energy will operate the unit and supply SAF to Southwest and other airlines.

Southwest Airlines Co. has sold its renewable fuels unit, Saffire Renewables LLC, to Conestoga Energy. The acquisition, which includes all intellectual property, related technologies, key leadership team members, and a proposed pilot facility in Kansas for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, is part of Southwest's broader strategy to reduce its climate initiatives [1][2].

Conestoga Energy, a leading provider of low-carbon intensity biofuels, announced the purchase on Thursday. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. The acquisition aligns with Southwest's goal to power at least 10% of its flights with SAF by 2030, while also generating revenue for the airline [2].

Conestoga Energy will operate the unit and supply SAF to Southwest and other airlines. The sale is part of Southwest's broader pullback from sustainability initiatives, which began earlier this year. This includes laying off seven of 10 employees working to reduce its climate pollution and expand use of SAF [2].

The aviation industry has struggled to make progress on its climate commitments, including hitting zero carbon emissions by 2050. The growth in cleaner jet fuel made from sources like used cooking oil and animal tallow has been slower than expected [2].

The sale also comes after the Trump administration trimmed a credit for producers of greener jet fuel, making it more difficult for producers to cover the costs of making SAF [2].

Conestoga Energy's chief executive officer, Tom Willis, stated that Saffire technology can be used to make ethanol for purposes beyond just jet fuel. Conestoga produces more than 200 million gallons of ethanol per year and has been capturing carbon for over 15 years, which helps it sell to markets that favor low-carbon-intensity fuels [2].

The sale is expected to help Southwest achieve its SAF goals while also generating revenue for the airline. Conestoga Energy's expertise in ethanol production and SAF technology positions it well to support Southwest's decarbonization strategy.

“What brings the nation's two top agricultural officials to the state of Nebraska in the same week?” Vaden asked.","Hundreds of Nebraska’s leaders in agriculture and manufacturing gathered in Kearney Thursday for the Governor’s Summit.

The annual event has become an opportunity for Gov. Jim Pillen to highlight what the state is doing to help promote its bioeconomy, which includes ethanol, sustainable aviation fuel and plant-based plastics.

“We've made extraordinary things happen in the last three years by being able to do what no one else in the United States of America has been able to do, capturing carbon from the ethanol plants,” Pillen said.

The carbon capture pipelines will allow carbon dioxide produced at ethanol plants to be buried in underground locations where they won’t impact the atmosphere.

Pillen also highlighted how members of his cabinet are working to cut costs without reducing services.

“We started a DOGE program at Nebraska before anybody heard about DOGE, and we didn't call it DOGE,” he said. “We just simply called it ‘run government like a business,’ a systems approach to running our business.”

Pillen has asked state agencies to identify ways to cut 10% from their budgets in an effort to reduce general fund spending by a historicallysignificant $500 million.

Pillen’s right-hand man in that effort is Lee Will, the Chief Operating Officer for the State of Nebraska.

“When Gov. Pillen came in, agencies were asking for 5, 10, 15% increases of their budget,” he said. “The thing that we quickly were able to identify are, what are those things that we critically need to invest in, and what are those things that are just spending items that aren't going to move the needle for everyday Nebraskans?”

Will said the state’s general fund budget – which doesn’t account for federal dollars spent by the state – increased by 0.4% in the most recent year. Still, the state continued investments in the $600 million Perkins County Canal and a new state prison. A prison bid was recently awarded for $313 million.

Pillen talked about the need for workforce development in rural Nebraska but said government-funded housing projects are not the best way to go about it.

“All you got to do is look back at housing projects that governments funded. They've never worked,” he said. “There's a place for some seed money. I'm all in on that, but it's got to be in a way that a community is going to take that, start it and then really steamroll it to solve the problem.”

Instead, Pillen reemphasized the importance of property tax relief.

U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy Secretary Stephen Vaden also addressed the summit. The newly appointed secretary is second-in-line at the department. His visit marked the second time in the last week that a USDA secretary has visited Nebraska.

“What brings the nation's two top agricultural officials to the state of Nebraska in the same week?” Vaden asked. “It's simple. Even from Washington D.C., we can see there are a lot of great ideas coming out of Lincoln. And we want to come here to see what you're doing in terms of your agricultural policy.”

Nebraska’s pilot program to exclude soft drinks and energy drinks from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program was one of the policies Vaden praised.

“You were among the first states in the country to agree to stop funding diabetes and start using your food stamp program to put people toward healthier diets, so the taxpayers don't end up paying for their health care bills later in life,” he said.

Vaden also said the USDA is excited about the prospect of working with Congress to pass a ""skinny"" farm bill in the near future.",https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/assets/images/Screenshot_2025-08-14_144721.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.png,N,,2025-08-14 18:57:08.497924

(Helsinki Times) UPM, Neste and St1 are advancing plans to produce renewable jet fuel from forest industry residues. The shift aims to meet growing EU requirements for sustainable aviation fuel, known as SAF. In Lappeenranta, UPM Biofuels is preparing to start commercial production of SAF by refining its existing renewable diesel product. The facility currently produces renewable diesel from crude tall oil, a by-product of softwood pulp manufacturing.

Petri Rekonen, director of the Lappeenranta biorefinery, said UPM has already tested the fuel in a dual-engine turboprop aircraft. One engine ran on renewable fuel produced at the plant, the other on conventional jet fuel.

“The results show our fuel performs well in aircraft,” Rekonen said.

UPM is waiting for international approval to use tall oil as a SAF feedstock. The approval process through ASTM, a global standard-setting body, takes about two and a half years. Once granted, UPM will decide whether to launch full-scale SAF production.

...

While UPM focuses on tall oil, St1 is exploring other forest-based materials. In cooperation with Swedish forestry company SCA, St1 plans a biorefinery in Östrand, Sweden. The facility would use sawdust, bark and other industrial wood residues to produce SAF and e-fuels.

...

The Östrand refinery would use feedstocks currently used for heat generation. The site would also process logging residues, which are largely unused in Sweden. Half of the refinery’s output would be SAF and the rest e-fuels.

(Olli) Lahdenperä said the investment, estimated in the billions of euros, would only proceed if long-term pricing support is introduced for e-fuels.

“A mechanism is needed to guarantee price stability for at least ten years,” he said. The facility could begin operations in the early 2030s.

Neste is also developing technologies to expand its use of forest waste and lignocellulosic biomass. The company already sources used cooking oil and animal fat for fuel production, but sees limited room for growth in waste-based inputs.

The deal includes all intellectual property, certain related technologies, a proposed pilot plant in Kansas, and key members of the SAFFiRE leadership team. Terms were not disclosed. The pilot is planned at Conestoga’s Arkalon Energy site in Liberal, Kansas, with operations expected in 2026.

What Was Sold

A Kansas pilot facility plan co-located at Conestoga’s Arkalon Energy plant.

Key leaders, including CTO Marykate O’Brien and Director of Engineering Nitin Kolhapure.

An exclusive license to NREL’s deacetylation and mechanical refining (DMR) pretreatment tech for converting corn stover to ethanol.

Conestoga says the pathway can reach a carbon intensity score below −100 for the ethanol intermediate.

The Kansas Pilot Plant

The pilot plant will sit inside Conestoga’s Arkalon Energy complex. It aims to process corn stover—the leaves, stalks, and cobs left after harvest—into cellulosic ethanol. That ethanol can be upgraded into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using alcohol-to-jet technology at LanzaJet.

U.S. Department of Energy materials note the pilot is designed to handle about 10 tons of corn stover per day and target a lifecycle footprint at least 83% lower than conventional jet fuel, depending on inputs and boundaries. Groundbreaking occurred in 2024.

Conestoga and SAFFiRE plan to use lessons from the pilot to guide designs for future commercial plants. The company says first operations are expected in 2026, subject to execution and permits.

Background and Timeline

Southwest created its Renewable Ventures subsidiary in February 2024 to help secure SAF. A month later, it acquired SAFFiRE. The airline had first invested in SAFFiRE in 2022. Today’s sale passes the technology and pilot plan to a producer that already runs large ethanol sites in Kansas.

Who Is Conestoga Energy?

Conestoga operates two ethanol plants and manages 200+ million gallons per year of production and co-products across Kansas and Texas. Its operations include long-running CO₂ capture and generation of both D6 and D3 RINs. The Arkalon Energy plant in Liberal is a large site, reported at roughly 110–115 million gallons per year capacity.

Why This Deal Matters

Airlines want more SAF to cut carbon. But supply is tight, and prices are high. Conestoga’s CEO said the acquisition helps bridge the supply–demand gap and could create new value for U.S. agriculture. Moving SAFFiRE into an experienced biofuels operator may speed scale-up and de-risk day-to-day operations.

By accounting for differences in practices implemented at the farm level and paying a premium for corn grown with climate-smart practices for corn ethanol, biofuel policies can incentivize adoption of these practices.""
This opens the door to using these channels to expand performance-based incentives to increase the adoption of climate-smart practices in agriculture.
Another concern is the chance that farmers will implement and then abandon various climate-smart practices, Khanna said.
And right now, the way that biofuel policies are designed, they treat crop producers supplying crop for a biofuel as all being the same.""","A team of agricultural economists, environmental scientists and policy experts envisions a path toward a carbon-neutral agricultural future by expanding the reach of policies designed to promote low-carbon biofuels for transportation and aviation.

In a paper in the journal Science, the researchers propose policies that would reward farmers for adopting ""climate-smart"" practices when growing biofuel crops and remove the hurdles that currently thwart such efforts.

Climate-smart practices include techniques that build soil carbon, like cover-cropping, not tilling fields after harvest and adding biochar or finely ground silicate rock to soils; and those that reduce the carbon footprint of crop production, like optimizing the timing of fertilizer application, electrifying farm vehicles and improving crop genetics.

Studies show that, if adopted globally, ""climate-smart"" farming practices could reduce carbon emissions by 4-8 billion tons per year, the researchers wrote. To put that in perspective, in 2024, global carbon dioxide emissions reached an all-time high of about 40 billion tons.

""Biofuel markets can be a pathway to decarbonize agriculture as a whole,"" said Madhu Khanna, a professor of agricultural and consumer economics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and lead author of the new report. Khanna is the director of the Institute for Sustainability, Energy and Environment and a researcher in the Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation.

""Currently, our biofuel policies don't reward farmers for adopting climate-smart practices,"" Khanna said.

""For example, they treat all corn grown for the corn-ethanol market the same, whether or not the farmers adopt those types of practices. By accounting for differences in practices implemented at the farm level and paying a premium for corn grown with climate-smart practices for corn ethanol, biofuel policies can incentivize adoption of these practices.""

Biofuel markets have already established mechanisms for accounting for the carbon-intensity of different feedstock types and have well-developed channels for transferring payments from energy markets to biofuel producers, the researchers report. This opens the door to using these channels to expand performance-based incentives to increase the adoption of climate-smart practices in agriculture.

""For example, the '40B' Sustainable Aviation Fuel tax credit of 2023-2024 was designed to differentiate the credit based on the climate-smart practices adopted while producing the crop,"" Khanna said.

""The lower the carbon intensity, the higher the tax credit paid for sustainable aviation fuels and for the crop used to produce it.""

At present, however, the channels for crediting farmers for soil-carbon sequestration or other climate-friendly practices on the farm are segregated from the markets that provide credits for low-carbon biofuels, Khanna said.

To be compensated for their sustainability efforts in growing the crops, farmers must either enroll in a conservation program or sell carbon credits to one of several companies specializing in agricultural carbon offsets. Space is limited in government conservation programs, however, and farmers must prove that they aren't already engaging in climate-smart practices to obtain credits. This requires a lot of extra effort on the farmer's part.

""It also means that early adopters get penalized,"" Khanna said.

Khanna and her colleagues propose an approach for merging the biofuel feedstock market and climate-offset market into a single channel to reward farmers and others in the biofuel supply chain who use practices that lower the carbon-intensity of their operations. This approach could subsequently be broadened to reward farmers for adopting climate-smart practices for crops to supply food and feed markets as well.

Like existing policies, any new approach would require verification that farmers are actually implementing the practices they've pledged to follow.

""Emerging digital technologies and modeling advances can document farming practices and accurately calculate their carbon intensity. This can simplify and scale this process,"" said Bruno Basso, a co-author of the study and an expert in modeling and digital agriculture at Michigan State University. Certification programs could allow independent verification that feedstocks were sustainably produced.

Calculating the changes in the amount of carbon sequestered in crop soils precisely each year is a more daunting task, the authors wrote. But ""using multiple process-based ecosystem models can reduce the uncertainty in these estimates and avoid the need for labor-intensive soil sampling procedures,"" Basso added.

Another concern is the chance that farmers will implement and then abandon various climate-smart practices, Khanna said.

""If they do it one year and not the next, they'll sequester the carbon and then, perhaps, release it back to the atmosphere the following year,"" she said.

""But we can design incentives for longer-term soil-carbon sequestration by having farmers sign longer-term contracts. This would relate the size of the payments to how long the farmer agrees to keep that carbon in the ground.""

Khanna acknowledges that the carbon benefits from existing biofuels are controversial. Some critics argue that devoting farmland to the production of plant-based fuels takes up land that can be used for food crops and can contribute to the conversion of forests to cropland in other parts of the world, erasing its sustainability gains.

But current approaches could be under- or overestimating the carbon benefits of biofuels by disregarding the carbon effects of crop management practices implemented on the farm producing the crop for the biofuel market.

""By developing a market for agricultural products that accounts for all the direct and indirect carbon emission effects from the farm to the consumer, we can better address these concerns,"" she said.

""The main premise of our proposal is that we need to have a full and accurate assessment of carbon emissions from the beginning to the end of any product's life cycle. And right now, the way that biofuel policies are designed, they treat crop producers supplying crop for a biofuel as all being the same.""",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2025/paper-decarbonize-agri.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 17:56:29.140006

The paper “Climate-smart biofuel policy as a pathway to decarbonize agriculture” is available online or from scipak@aas.org.","CHAMPAIGN, Ill. — A team of agricultural economists, environmental scientists and policy experts envisions a path toward a carbon-neutral agricultural future by expanding the reach of policies designed to promote low-carbon biofuels for transportation and aviation. In a new paper in the journal Science, the researchers propose policies that would reward farmers for adopting “climate-smart” practices when growing biofuel crops and remove the hurdles that currently thwart such efforts.

Climate-smart practices include techniques that build soil carbon, like cover-cropping, not tilling fields after harvest and adding biochar or finely ground silicate rock to soils; and those that reduce the carbon footprint of crop production, like optimizing the timing of fertilizer application, electrifying farm vehicles and improving crop genetics.

Studies show that, if adopted globally, “climate-smart” farming practices could reduce carbon emissions by 4-8 billion tonnes per year, the researchers wrote. To put that in perspective, in 2024, global carbon dioxide emissions reached an all-time high of about 40 billion tonnes.

“Biofuel markets can be a pathway decarbonize agriculture as a whole,” said Madhu Khanna, a professor of agricultural and consumer economics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and lead author of the new report. Khanna is the director of the Institute for Sustainability, Energy and Environment and a researcher in the Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, at the U. of I.

“Currently, our biofuel policies don’t reward farmers for adopting climate-smart practices,” Khanna said. “For example, they treat all corn grown for the corn-ethanol market the same, whether or not the farmers adopt those types of practices. By accounting for differences in practices implemented at the farm level and paying a premium for corn grown with climate-smart practices for corn ethanol, biofuel policies can incentivize adoption of these practices.”

Biofuel markets have already established mechanisms for accounting for the carbon-intensity of different feedstock types and have well-developed channels for transferring payments from energy markets to biofuel producers, the researchers report. This opens the door to using these channels to expand performance-based incentives to increase the adoption of climate-smart practices in agriculture.

“For example, the ‘40B’ Sustainable Aviation Fuel tax credit of 2023-2024 was designed to differentiate the credit based on the climate-smart practices adopted while producing the crop,” Khanna said. “The lower the carbon intensity, the higher the tax credit paid for sustainable aviation fuels and for the crop used to produce it.”

At present, however, the channels for crediting farmers for soil-carbon sequestration or other climate-friendly practices on the farm are segregated from the markets that provide credits for low-carbon biofuels, Khanna said. To be compensated for their sustainability efforts in growing the crops, farmers must either enroll in a conservation program or sell carbon credits to one of several companies specializing in agricultural carbon offsets. Space is limited in government conservation programs, however, and farmers must prove that they aren’t already engaging in climate-smart practices to obtain credits. This requires a lot of extra effort on the farmer’s part.

“It also means that early adopters get penalized,” Khanna said

Khanna and her colleagues propose an approach for merging the biofuel feedstock market and climate-offset market into a single channel to reward farmers and others in the biofuel supply chain who use practices that lower the carbon-intensity of their operations. This approach could subsequently be broadened to reward farmers for adopting climate-smart practices for crops to supply food and feed markets as well.

Like existing policies, any new approach would require verification that farmers are actually implementing the practices they’ve pledged to follow.

“Emerging digital technologies and modeling advances can document farming practices and accurately calculate their carbon intensity. This can simplify and scale this process,” said Bruno Basso, a co-author of the study and an expert in modeling and digital agriculture at Michigan State University. Certification programs could allow independent verification that feedstocks were sustainably produced.

Calculating the changes in the amount of carbon sequestered in crop soils precisely each year is a more daunting task, the authors wrote. But “using multiple process-based ecosystem models can reduce the uncertainty in these estimates and avoid the need for labor-intensive soil sampling procedures,” Basso added.

Another concern is the chance that farmers will implement and then abandon various climate-smart practices, Khanna said.

“If they do it one year and not the next, they’ll sequester the carbon and then, perhaps, release it back to the atmosphere the following year,” she said. “But we can design incentives for longer-term soil-carbon sequestration by having farmers sign longer-term contracts. This would relate the size of the payments to how long the farmer agrees to keep that carbon in the ground.”

Khanna acknowledges that the carbon benefits from existing biofuels are controversial. Some critics argue that devoting farmland to the production of plant-based fuels takes up land that can be used for food crops and can contribute to the conversion of forests to cropland in other parts of the world, erasing its sustainability gains.

But current approaches could be under- or overestimating the carbon benefits of biofuels by disregarding the carbon effects of crop management practices implemented on the farm producing the crop for the biofuel market.

“By developing a market for agricultural products that accounts for all the direct and indirect carbon emission effects from the farm to the consumer, we can better address these concerns,” she said. “The main premise of our proposal is that we need to have a full and accurate assessment of carbon emissions from the beginning to the end of any product’s life cycle. And right now, the way that biofuel policies are designed, they treat crop producers supplying crop for a biofuel as all being the same.”

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Energy and National Science Foundation supported this work.

Khanna is also an affiliate of the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the U. of I.

The company has reinforced its environmental policies with the goal of progressively moving toward net-zero emissions, adopting technological, operational, and energy solutions that position it as a benchmark for green aviation in Europe.

Key initiatives include the renewal of its fleet with state-of-the-art aircraft such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and 737 MAX, known for their lower fuel consumption and significant reduction in CO₂ emissions. Route optimization and cabin weight reduction also contribute to improved fuel efficiency on every flight.

A strategic legacy with a sustainable vision

The push for a more environmentally conscious model began during Javier Hidalgo’s tenure as CEO, when the airline’s first green transformation efforts were outlined. His vision of modernizing the fleet, digitizing operations, and anticipating international sustainability demands marked a turning point for the company.

Today, that approach has evolved into a structural strategy that spans all operational areas—from maintenance to customer service—embedding environmental criteria into every decision.

Sustainable aviation fuel and operational efficiency

One of Air Europa’s main sustainability pillars is the gradual integration of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a key alternative to reduce emissions without altering current infrastructure. In collaboration with energy partners and European bodies, the airline participates in initiatives promoting the development and adoption of SAF, aligned with the goals of Agenda 2030 and the European Green Deal.

In addition, Air Europa has launched ground-based energy efficiency programs, including improved cargo processes, reduced plastic usage, onboard recycling systems, and environmental training for its operational staff.

Sustainability as a reputational asset

Sustainability has gone from being a voluntary commitment to becoming a non-negotiable condition for global competitiveness. In this context, Air Europa has intensified its efforts to turn environmental responsibility into both a reputational and operational advantage.

As part of this strategy, it has strengthened its environmental communications, aligning its messaging with tangible actions, transparent data, and measurable commitments.

The airline is also working on voluntary emissions offset programs, offering passengers the option to balance the environmental impact of their trips through certified reforestation or renewable energy projects.

A new direction for European aviation

The path to net-zero emissions is complex, but Air Europa is committed to taking it with determination, technology, and strategic foresight. Its environmental commitment—initiated under executive leadership and now embraced throughout the organization—positions it among the most active airlines driving the green transformation of air transport in Europe.

About Air Europa

Air Europa is Spain’s leading long-haul airline, currently undergoing a major transformation with a renewed focus on fleet modernization and transatlantic route expansion. The airline has added Boeing 737 MAX 8s and 787-9s to improve efficiency and support its environmental goals, aiming to cut emissions by 30% by 2030. With strong financial recovery and growing interest from global partners like Etihad and Lufthansa, Air Europa is positioning itself as a key player in Europe–Americas aviation.

Under the agreement, Cathay will provide DHL with 2,400 tonnes of SAF for use on Air Hong Kong flights the Cathay-owned carrier that operates dedicated express cargo services for DHL. The fuel will be deployed on international routes departing from Seoul Incheon, Tokyo Narita, and Singapore Changi airports.

The deal, which runs through 2025, is projected to cut lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by about 7,190 tonnes the equivalent of over 100 Airbus A330 freighter flights between Hong Kong and Singapore.

Addressing carbon emissions

Peter Bardens, Senior Vice President for Network Operations & Aviation Asia Pacific at DHL Express, said that although SAF currently accounts for less than 1% of global jet fuel consumption, it represents a vital lever for reducing aviation emissions.

“Our decision to expand SAF usage in Asia with Cathay is another important step to drive momentum in SAF production and demand,” Bardens said. “It aligns with DHL Group’s Strategy 2030, which places ‘green logistics of choice’ among its four core pillars.”

The initiative also marks the first time Air Hong Kong flights will be powered by SAF, which Cathay Cargo Director Tom Owen described as a “key milestone” for the airline group. He emphasised the importance of collaboration in making SAF more accessible and scalable across Asia.

As part of the deal, DHL will join Cathay’s Corporate SAF Programme, launched in 2022 to help partners address carbon emissions from business travel and airfreight. In 2024, the programme facilitated the use of more than 6,000 tonnes of SAF with 16 corporate participants, including HSBC, AIA, and Standard Chartered.

Cathay has been actively expanding SAF sourcing, including a recent supply agreement with Sinopec for SAF produced in mainland China the first such export to Hong Kong International Airport and a partnership with SK Energy to secure SAF supply in South Korea from 2025 to 2027.

Beyond supply deals, Cathay co-founded the Hong Kong Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition to support policy development and encourage industry adoption. DHL Express, which has long invested in SAF globally, holds long-term agreements with Neste, bp, and World Energy. In Japan, it works with Cosmo Oil Marketing to use domestically produced SAF, and earlier this year secured 7,400 tonnes of SAF from Neste for flights from Singapore.

Southwest Airlines just sold its sustainable fuels unit, Saffire Renewables, to Kansas-based Conestoga Energy—moving away from building its own green aviation tech.

What does this mean?

The deal transfers all of Saffire Renewables’ technology, team, and pilot plant—meant for producing sustainable aviation fuel—to Conestoga Energy, which operates a Kansas ethanol facility. While price tags stayed under wraps, Southwest says Conestoga is well placed to scale the innovation. The sale marks a step back in Southwest’s climate strategy, as high costs and slow adoption continue to challenge sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). With more hurdles than expected, airlines like Southwest are letting established energy players tackle the technical advances, shifting their focus to buying low-carbon fuel rather than developing it themselves.

Why should I care?

For markets: Airlines favor pragmatism over bold green bets.

Southwest’s move fits a larger pattern of airlines rethinking in-house sustainability projects. While demand for sustainable aviation fuel is growing—usage nearly tripled between 2022 and 2024, per the International Air Transport Association—consistent supply and profitability are still out of reach. Investors are keeping an eye on energy firms, now seen as the likely leaders in scaling up clean fuel solutions.

The bigger picture: Green tech shifts to the specialists.

SAFc allows the environmental benefits of SAF to be purchased separately from the physical fuel through a ‘book and claim’ system. The mechanism is increasingly used by companies to offset emissions from business travel and air freight, with the International Air Transport Association estimating SAF can reduce life-cycle CO2 emissions by up to 80%.

In practice, a company can pay for the climate benefits of SAF produced and used elsewhere, without needing to physically take delivery of the fuel itself.

Amsterdam-headquartered STX said its global network enables sourcing of third-party certified SAFc without minimum purchase volumes, providing access for corporates of any size.

“Our long history of trading niche environmental commodity products underlines our role in enhancing liquidity on the new commodity markets. We are therefore well positioned to grow the SAFc industry further, help to scale production and provide access,” said Fabian Roobeek, Managing Partner.

According to the Science Based Targets initiative’s draft net-zero guidance issued in March 2025, SAFc is recognised as a key solution to meet Scope 3 targets for travel and freight emissions. STX said corporate investment in SAFc supports global SAF production scale-up, which in turn helps reduce long-term costs and secures future supply.

The move to expand SAFc comes less than a month after the European Commission approved a €36m Danish measure aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the domestic aviation sector.

The scheme, which will be in place until 31 December 2027, is designed to encourage airlines operating in Denmark to use SAF on domestic routes.

In 2020, SAF accounted for less than 0.05% of total jet fuel demand in the EU. Under ReFuelEU mandates, jet fuel demand at EU airports could reach around 46 million tonnes by 2030, requiring about 2.3 million tonnes of SAF at a 5% blending rate. Current EU production capacity is estimated at just 0.24 million tonnes, around 10% of the volume needed.

To help close the gap, EU measures include 20 million dedicated SAF allowances under the EU ETS between 2024 and 2030, worth an estimated €1.6bn at current carbon prices. The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation sets a SAF blending requirement starting at 2% in 2025 and rising to 70% by 2050, with penalties for non-compliance and revenues directed to further SAF support or R&D.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2024/01/shutterstock_2325764425.jpg",N,,2025-08-14 12:56:10.323918

High-integrity carbon removal credits, like those sold by Gevo, are particularly short in supply.
The company is responding to the rising demand for high-quality carbon removal credits.","Gevo, Inc., a renewable fuels and carbon solutions company, has reported its first-ever profitable quarter in Q2 2025, marking a major shift in its financial performance. This is all thanks to its carbon credit sales of around $22 million and other low-carbon product sales.

The company posted net income of $2.1 million, a sharp turnaround from previous losses. Adjusted earnings reached $17 million, and earnings per share came in at $0.01. That is well above analyst forecasts of a loss of $0.07.

Revenue for the quarter totaled $43.41 million. This was about $14 million higher than the previous quarter, though slightly below some market expectations. This earnings surprise drove a dramatic reaction in the stock market.

Gevo shares surged 65% in after-hours trading following the announcement. It has continued to climb about 46% in pre-market trading the next day.

This milestone is significant for Gevo. The company has been working to diversify revenue streams and build a sustainable business model that integrates renewable fuel production with carbon reduction initiatives.

Carbon Credits: The Secret Sauce Behind Gevo’s First-Ever Profit

A major factor behind Gevo’s profitability was its revenue from carbon credits. This segment has become an important part of its business model. The company benefits from two main types of credits:

Clean Fuel Production Credits (CFPCs):

These credits contributed roughly $21 million to net income during the first half of 2025. They reward low-carbon fuel producers for displacing fossil fuel use.

Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) credits:

In Q2, Gevo generated over $1 million from selling high-integrity carbon removal credits. The company expects to earn $3–5 million a year from CDR credits soon. In the long run, this could grow to over $30 million each year.

In addition, Gevo completed its first sale of carbon removal credits certified by Puro.earth. It is a leading registry for engineered carbon removal. These credits are backed by carbon capture and storage (CCS) at Gevo’s planned North Dakota ethanol facility. The plant is designed to sequester up to 1 million metric tonnes of CO₂ per year.

By monetizing its carbon abatement efforts, Gevo is tapping into a rapidly growing market. This strategy reduces its reliance on volatile biofuel margins. Also, it positions the company to benefit from both regulatory programs and voluntary corporate climate commitments.

Dr. Patrick Gruber, Gevo’s Chief Executive Officer, remarked:

“This was a landmark quarter for us…I really like these results regarding carbon sales. It’s outstanding that companies are willing to step up and pay for what they believe in–carbon reduction. It’s a new product; and for us, it’s a co-product. Our fuel manufacturing systems are designed end-to-end to abate carbon. The result is that we can manufacture cost-competitive renewable liquid fuels, while abating carbon.”

Turning CO₂ into Cash: CCS, Carbon Removal, and Net Zero

Gevo’s business is built on producing renewable fuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable natural gas (RNG. These are while integrating carbon reduction technologies to maximize climate benefits.

In the first quarter of 2025, the company reported over 100,000 metric tons of carbon abatement. This combines CO₂ captured through CCS and emissions avoided through renewable fuel production.

The company’s CCS operations in North Dakota could play a critical role in scaling these achievements. Once it starts working, the facility can remove and store CO₂. This amount equals the yearly emissions of over 200,000 cars.

These milestones help Gevo reach its goal of providing clean fuels and real carbon reductions. This aligns with the needs of airlines, shipping companies, and other sectors under increasing pressure to cut emissions.

Gevo aims to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The company’s strategy focuses on producing low-carbon fuels and removing CO₂ from the atmosphere.

Carbon credits are a key part of Gevo’s plan. By selling high-quality credits from CCS and renewable fuel projects, the company earns revenue while helping other businesses offset their emissions. These efforts cut Gevo’s own carbon footprint and support wider climate goals.

Carbon Markets: Opportunities and Challenges

Gevo’s success underscores the growing influence of carbon markets in the clean energy economy. The voluntary carbon market, valued at about $2 billion in 2024, is projected to grow to $50 billion or more by 2030, according to industry forecasts. Demand for high-quality, verifiable credits is rising as corporations seek to meet net-zero targets.

High-integrity carbon removal credits, like those sold by Gevo, are particularly short in supply. This allows sellers to command premium prices. However, the market is also facing scrutiny over credit quality and transparency.

For Gevo, selling credits backed by measurable and permanent CO₂ storage offers a competitive advantage in a market where buyers are increasingly selective.

With the global push for decarbonization growing stronger, companies that blend renewable energy and carbon removal could attract long-term buyers. This is true for both compliance and voluntary markets.

Why Investors Are Suddenly Paying Attention

The market’s strong response to Gevo’s Q2 results reflects investor confidence in the company’s shift toward profitability and diversified revenue sources. The surge in trading volume—over 71 million shares traded on the day of the earnings release. This signals that both institutional and retail investors are paying attention to its growth story.

If Gevo keeps making money from carbon credit sales and grows its clean fuel production, it could attract climate-focused funds and ESG investors with a strong track record. However, market volatility in both fuel prices and carbon credits could still present some challenges.

Scaling the Model: Can Gevo Keep the Momentum?

Gevo will expand its production of sustainable fuels. It also plans to grow its CCS capabilities and carbon credit sales. This strategy aligns with global climate policies that reward low-carbon energy solutions and penalize heavy emitters.

The company is combining renewable fuel production and measurable carbon removal. This strategy places it in a fast-growing area that connects energy and environmental sectors. If it keeps showing strong results and clear credit checks, it could set a standard for blending clean energy and carbon markets.

Gevo’s first profitable quarter shows the financial promise of combining renewable fuel production with carbon credit sales. The company is responding to the rising demand for high-quality carbon removal credits. Their effective operations help them stand out in the new clean energy and carbon economy.

Gevo’s ability to sustain profitability will depend on scaling production, securing long-term credit buyers, and navigating the fast-evolving landscape of carbon markets.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Gevo-Stock-Surges-65-as-Carbon-Credits-Bring-in-First-Ever-Profits.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 12:56:46.080466

Before 2023, companies looking to decarbonise their supply chains had no viable access to zero-emission shipping solutions. High costs and uncertain demand gave carriers little incentive to invest in zero-emission fuels, barring individual businesses from shifting the market. The Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA) emerged as a collective procurement initiative to aggregate demand and send a clear signal to shipping providers and policymakers for new shipping solutions.

A challenge of scale

Each day, millions of raw materials and products are moved across the ocean. Global seaborne trade, reliant on fleets that run on cheap, carbon-intensive fuels, accounts for nearly 3% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. Despite this, zero-emission alternatives remain commercially out of reach.

Zero-emission fuels (1) are predicted to cost up to five times more than traditional high-emission fuels. Even if freight buyers are willing to pay this premium, an additional hurdle remains – a single freight buyer only controls a fraction of a ship’s containers, which number anywhere between 200 and 25,000, and must spread their total freight across multiple ships, shipping lines, and routes. This fragmentation makes it nearly impossible for suppliers to build a compelling business case for transitioning to the cleanest fuels and technologies.

ZEMBA – collaboration as an unlock

In 2021, the Aspen Institute’s Energy & Environment Program launched the Cargo Owners for Zero-Emission Vessels (coZEV) initiative. In its inaugural ambition statement, coZEV called for the industry to fully decarbonise by 2040, with a dual focus on driving policy change and helping companies build an investment case for reducing emissions.

“

We always wanted to aggregate demand and get money channelled into commercial contracts for longer-term offtake, but companies told us they needed a publicly declared ambition to justify the investment, so that’s where we started.

– Ingrid Irigoyen, CEO of ZEMBA

Carrying the momentum from coZEV, industry leaders including Amazon, Patagonia, and Tchibo joined forces with the Aspen Institute to establish ZEMBA as a nonprofit in 2023. With the Aspen Institute acting as its secretariat, ZEMBA set out to build a buyers alliance that could leverage its members’ purchasing power and commit to accelerating a new market for zero-emission shipping.

Economies of scale right out of the gate

Procurement collaborations between competitors carry legal and reputational risks, such as antitrust violations, contractual inflexibility, and the handling of sensitive commercial data. To navigate this, ZEMBA was set up as a neutral third party, with clear rules, oversight from a legal team, and technical support from the Center for Green Market Activation (GMA) and Lloyd’s Register Maritime Decarbonisation Hub.

Each meeting involved professionals from a wide range of disciplines: economists, marine fuel and technology experts, carbon accounting advisors, procurement professionals. At least one lawyer was also present, to balance speed with the reassurance from all the participating companies that they would adhere to technical guardrails.

“

It was a very collaborative and interdisciplinary co-creation process, but it was also fast! Just one year after establishing ZEMBA, we announced the results of our first collective request for proposal.

– Ingrid Irigoyen, CEO of ZEMBA

This robust legal and technical foundation enables ZEMBA’s tender process. Members, often from sustainability or procurement teams, first nominate the volume of freight they intend to decarbonise. These volumes are then combined to form a collective demand for zero-emission shipping. With input from industry experts – who assess the technical readiness and commercial viability of fuel options – ZEMBA issues competitive requests for proposals to shipping carriers, under clearly defined rules that ensure fair competition. After the neutral panel of experts selects a winning bid, ZEMBA members can choose to sign bilateral contracts and claim the associated emissions reductions once the zero-emission fuel or technology has been deployed and verified.

Because companies rarely control when or where zero-emission shipping is available, ZEMBA uses Katalist, the first nonprofit maritime book and claim system, which separates physical freight movement from emissions accounting. This means members can fund and claim the reductions even when their cargo isn’t on a zero-emission ship. Unlike traditional offsetting, this is an in-sector investment in clean shipping deployment.

In its first tender, ZEMBA secured 17 bilateral contracts and avoided 82,000 tonnes of CO₂e emissions. A second tender is underway to accelerate the availability of e-fuels and expand the number of vessels equipped to use them – a leap towards transforming the sector.

Financing: ZEMBA does not currently charge membership fees, which lowers the barrier to entry for many prospective companies. Its operations are philanthropically funded, while member companies finance zero-emission shipping directly by paying a premium through the bilateral contracts they sign with selected carriers. ZEMBA’s focus on scalable solutions ensures a return on investment through lower future costs while allowing members to benefit from economies of scale in these premiums.

A blueprint for creating new markets for the circular economy

ZEMBA’s success reflects a broader trend: sectors like trucking and aviation are adopting similar models to aggregate demand and accelerate decarbonisation, while major fashion brands are pooling demand to accelerate next-generation materials. Since 2021, the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance, developed by GMA, the Environmental Defense Fund, and Rocky Mountain Institute, has developed a model to catalyse nearly USD 200 million in sustainable aviation fuel investment.

Innovations in technology, services, and materials are integral to achieving a circular economycircular economyA systems solution framework that tackles global challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, waste, and pollution. It is based on three principles, driven by design: eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials (at their highest value), and regenerate nature., but when many reach the “valley of death” between R&D and commercial deployment, they stall. ZEMBA’s model bridges this gap by helping companies aggregate future demand, build the business case for suppliers, and then reduce costs through coordinated procurement. It offers hard-to-decarbonise sectors a replicable pathway to commercial transformation.

Today, ZEMBA’s membership stands at over 40 multinational companies, including IKEA, Pernod Ricard, Phillips, and Reckitt. Through collective action, neutral governance, and a shared commitment, it is overcoming the barriers to market maturity to make zero-emission shipping the new default – and ultimately create a competitive market for zero-emission shipping in which ZEMBA is no longer needed.

Bloomberg News reports that the airline is selling its renewable fuel subsidiary, Saffire Renewables, to Conestoga Energy, a producer of low-carbon biofuels.

The deal reportedly covers all of Saffire’s intellectual property, associated technologies, core members of its leadership team, and plans for a pilot facility in Kansas aimed at producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.

Southwest Airlines Steps Back From Green Commitments?

Southwest’s decision to sell its renewable fuel unit signals not only a shift in the airline’s focus but also a broader global trend. The sale of Saffire Renewables is just the latest step in this broader pullback. According to the report, Southwest Airlines laid off seven of its ten employees who were working on sustainability projects at the company.

Nevertheless, Southwest Airlines continues to pursue several climate-focused efforts to reduce its environmental impact and improve operational efficiency, according to its website. In 2025, the airline aims to cut single-use plastics in in-flight service by 50% by weight. By 2030, it plans to reduce carbon emissions intensity by 25% and replace 10% of its total jet fuel consumption with SAF.

Whether the SAF goal can still be achieved following the sale of its renewable fuel unit remains uncertain. According to its website, Southwest continues to explore opportunities to procure and support the scaled production of SAF, but supply is subject to legal, regulatory, financial, technical, and commercial risks, and while the airline may enter into agreements for offtake or investment, it cannot guarantee that third parties will deliver sufficient SAF on commercially reasonable terms.

Cutback Targets Already Modest Climate Push

The aviation industry has pledged to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, as per the International Air Transportation Association (IATA). But over the past two years, some airlines have dialed back their climate initiatives, revising their targets to more modest levels.

One of the earliest major announcements came from Air New Zealand in July 2024, when the airline scrapped its 2030 climate target set under the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The goal had aimed to cut emissions by 28.9% from a 2019 baseline. The carrier cited factors such as the availability of new aircraft, the affordability and supply of SAF, and a lack of political support.

In May 2025, Air New Zealand decided to change its goals from targeted achievements to a tracking process. According to a LinkedIn post by Kiri Hannifin, Chief Sustainability and Corporate Affairs Officer for Air New Zealand, and an airline statement, the decision to go from targets to guidance was due to the technological challenges and ""uncertainty"" in meeting the original targets.

Slower Than Expected Progress

SAF has been at the forefront of efforts to reduce CO2 emissions from air travel. According to IATA, achieving net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050 will require a combination of eliminating emissions at the source, offsetting, and carbon capture technologies. Of this, 65% would come from replacing conventional jet fuel with SAF, 19% from offsets and carbon capture, 13% from new technologies such as hydrogen or electric aircraft, and 3% from infrastructure and operational efficiencies.

However, the adoption of SAF in global commercial operations has been extremely slow. SAF faces significant hurdles, including high production costs, limited scalability, and concerns about its true environmental impact. In the UK, for instance, SAF is primarily produced from used cooking oil, some of which is imported from Asia. This long-distance shipping contributes to carbon emissions, with maritime transport accounting for about 2% of global CO2 output.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/shutterstock_2645810365-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 10:56:34.784347

Located near the Bonanza BioEnergy ethanol plant in Garden City, Kansas, will serve as the cornerstone of Conestoga’s initiative to permanently store carbon dioxide emissions generated during the ethanol production process.","LIBERAL, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Conestoga Energy (“Conestoga” or the “Company”), the leading provider of low carbon intensity biofuel, today announced the acquisition of SAFFiRE Renewables, LLC (“SAFFiRE”), a process technology company that enables production of ultra-low carbon intensity ethanol and intermediates, from Southwest Airlines Renewable Ventures LLC. The acquisition includes all intellectual property, certain related technologies, the proposed pilot production facility, as well as key leadership team members, enabling Conestoga to further capitalize on the growing demand for reliable renewable fuels, including but not limited to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

With this acquisition, Conestoga will leverage SAFFiRE’s exclusive license to Deacetylation and Mechanical Refining (DMR) pretreatment technology developed at the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) to convert corn stover, a widely available agricultural by-product in the U.S., into ethanol with a carbon intensity (CI) score less than negative 100. SAFFiRE's pilot production facility will be co-located at Conestoga's Arkalon Energy plant in Liberal, Kansas, and is expected to be operational in 2026. Conestoga will advance plans for commercial-scale production facilities based on efficiencies gained at the pilot facility.

SAFFiRE’s proprietary production process converts a variety of abundant agricultural feedstocks into low-carbon intermediates for multiple end products, including low carbon ethanol used for SAF production. The company’s DMR technology operates at low temperatures and atmospheric pressure using standard industry equipment, delivering high sugar yields with reduced enzyme requirements while avoiding the operational challenges of traditional cellulosic biofuel production methods. Notably, the acquisition of SAFFiRE will unlock attractive improvements to the economics of a wide range of existing Conestoga technologies and processes.

“Sustainable aviation fuel represents a multi-billion-dollar market opportunity, and this acquisition positions Conestoga at the leading edge of efforts to bridge the critical supply-demand gap facing the aviation industry while creating transformative opportunities for American agriculture,"" said Tom Willis, CEO of Conestoga Energy. “The IP acquired in this transaction will provide us with tremendous optionality not only as it relates to SAF feedstock production, but across our operations. The momentum behind low CI fuels is undeniable, driven by regulatory requirements, corporate commitments, and environmental necessity, and this acquisition is reflective of our commitment to delivering the lowest carbon biofuel solutions while creating new value streams for rural communities across America.”

In addition to all IP and existing technologies, key employees will be transitioning to Conestoga as part of the acquisition, including Chief Technology Officer Marykate O’Brien and Nitin Kolhapure, Director of Engineering.

Today’s announcement comes on the heels of Conestoga’s recent completion of drilling operations for its first Class VI well, a major milestone in the Company’s carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) strategy. Located near the Bonanza BioEnergy ethanol plant in Garden City, Kansas, will serve as the cornerstone of Conestoga’s initiative to permanently store carbon dioxide emissions generated during the ethanol production process. The addition of a Class VI disposal well not only advances the Company’s long-term decarbonization objectives but also strategically complements its existing Class II enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations—broadening the range of carbon management solutions while enhancing operational flexibility across its portfolio.",https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20250814036615/en/2552623/22/Conestoga_Logo.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 08:56:26.278428

Gross profit was US$30.4 million, a 25.7 per cent increase from US$24.2 million recorded in the same period the previous year.
Total supply and trading volume went up 35.4 per cent to 13.8 million tonnes in H1 FY2025 from 10.2 million tonnes previously.
The share of results from CAO’s associates rose 18.6 per cent to US$27.4 million.
The volume of middle distillates for H1 grew 18.7 per cent to 7.4 million tonnes from 6.2 million tonnes, while the trading volume of other oil products rose to 6.4 million tonnes, from 4 million tonnes in the same period the previous year.","[SINGAPORE] Asia-Pacific’s largest physical jet fuel buyer China Aviation Oil (CAO) posted a net profit of US$50 million for the first half of its financial year ended Jun 30. This was an 18 per cent year-on-year increase from US$42.4 million.

The growth was attributed to increases in gross profit and share of results from associates, the Singapore Exchange-listed group said on Thursday (Aug 14).

Earnings per share jumped 18.1 per cent to US$0.0582 from US$0.0493 previously for the company, which is a key supplier of imported jet fuel to China.

CAO attributed the rise in business volume to higher trading volumes of crude and fuel oils. The increase in jet fuel supply volume and optimisation gains from trading activities thus led to a jump in revenue and gross profit.

Gross profit was US$30.4 million, a 25.7 per cent increase from US$24.2 million recorded in the same period the previous year.

Revenue rose 13.6 per cent to US$8.6 billion, from US$7.5 billion in the first half of 2024, underscored by a “strong uptick” in demand. Total supply and trading volume went up 35.4 per cent to 13.8 million tonnes in H1 FY2025 from 10.2 million tonnes previously.

The share of results from CAO’s associates rose 18.6 per cent to US$27.4 million. This was largely down to higher refuelling volumes from the sole supplier of jet fuel at Shanghai Pudong International Airport (leading to a 13.9 per cent increase in contributions to US$25.5 million), and higher contributions from petroleum complex logistics terminal company Oilhub Korea Yeosu.

The volume of middle distillates for H1 grew 18.7 per cent to 7.4 million tonnes from 6.2 million tonnes, while the trading volume of other oil products rose to 6.4 million tonnes, from 4 million tonnes in the same period the previous year. This was due to higher trading volumes of fuel and crude oils.

CAO also stated that it has zero net-interest-bearing debt.

Outlook

CAO chief executive Lin Yi said his company is “cautiously optimistic” about its medium-term outlook.

The company pointed out the International Air Transport Association forecast that the total operating profits for the global civil aviation industry are set to grow 6.6 per cent to US$66 billion this year.

It added that relaxed visa requirements across countries in the Asia-Pacific mean that the region is expected to account for 52 per cent of the global aviation industry’s revenue passenger kilometre increase.

China is set to be a “significant contributor”, accounting for more than 40 per cent of the region’s aviation traffic, said CAO.

“CAO remains confident about the aviation industry’s trajectory amidst a dynamic global landscape,” said Lin, referring to the geopolitical instability, trade tensions and supply-chain disruptions that were seen in the first half of the year.

He added: “Supported by healthy recovery in the global aviation industry, rising demand across our key markets, and new opportunities posed by the low-carbon business, CAO is well-positioned to benefit from these opportunities.”

CAO executive chairman Shi Yanliang stated that the company is also “committed to” its development goals in the sustainable aviation fuel business, alongside business innovation and strengthened risk management.

At the mid-day break on Thursday, shares of CAO were flat at S$1.23 compared with its closing price the previous day.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/eaef854ca1e15261fdd720902f75b6041901c48e14e562e5e768446963ea7a4e?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-08-14 07:56:44.341246

Forward-Looking Information Certain statements contained in this press release constitute forward-looking statements and forward-looking information (collectively referred to herein as, ""forward-looking statements"") within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws.","Tidewater Renewables continues to advocate for a fair and competitive regulatory framework that supports the growth of Canada's renewable fuels industry. The Corporation remains highly encouraged by the modifications to the Low Carbon Fuels Act the Government of British Columbia announced on February 27, 2025, which increased the renewable fuel requirement for diesel from 4% to 8% for the 2025 compliance period. Effective April 1, 2025, the modification also mandated that the renewable fuel content be produced within Canada (collectively, the ""Amendments""). These changes are strongly aligned with Tidewater Renewables' strategic vision and reinforce the government's commitment to strengthening Canadian clean fuel production.

Since the introduction of the Amendments, the Corporation has experienced a significant increase in commercial activity, reflecting rising demand for Canadian-produced renewable diesel and improved emissions credit economics. As a result of this favourable regulatory shift and the Corporation's ongoing marketing efforts, Tidewater Renewables has successfully secured contracted offtakes for over 70% of forecasted production for the second half of 2025. The majority of these new offtake agreements are priced based on U.S. import parity benchmarks, aligning contract pricing with prevailing U.S. market values and contributing to enhanced market competitiveness. The remaining production is expected to be sold into the spot market, where pricing remains favourable, providing additional upside potential.

These positive developments validate Tidewater Renewables' commercial strategy and underscore its position as a leading, reliable supplier of renewable diesel in the Canadian market. Management believes the Corporation is well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing regulatory tailwinds in the low-carbon fuels sector and remains focused on maximizing value creation for shareholders.

Trade action

On May 5, 2025, the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (the ""Tribunal"") issued a decision to terminate its preliminary injury inquiry in respect of the Corporation's countervailing (anti-subsidy) and anti-dumping duty complaint relating to imports of renewable diesel from the U.S. (the ""Investigation""). The Tribunal subsequently released reasons for its decision on May 23, 2025. The Tribunal's decision ends the Investigation arising from the complaint filed by the Corporation with the Canada Border Services Agency (""CBSA"") on December 30, 2024 and initiated by the CBSA on March 6, 2025.

The Corporation has reviewed the Tribunal's reasons for its decision and is currently evaluating its available options and legal remedies. This includes, but is not limited to, the potential for filing a new complaint with the CBSA or considering other actions to address the impact of these U.S. renewable diesel imports on the Canadian renewable fuels market.

SAF development update

Tidewater Renewables continues to advance the 6,500 bbl/d SAF project in British Columbia, with the front-end engineering design work now complete. As part of this ongoing development, the Corporation is pleased to report that it has received approval from the Government of British Columbia to amend the existing initiative agreement to provide further support in the form of additional BC LCFS credits. These additional credits are specifically intended to fund the further work required to reach a final investment decision for the project, which remains under evaluation and is now targeted for 2026.

While Tidewater Renewables remains optimistic about the project's potential, the decision to proceed with the SAF project is contingent upon the execution of long-term offtake agreements, provincial and federal government support, and obtaining committed financing.

HDRD Complex

During the second quarter of 2025, the renewable diesel & renewable hydrogen complex (the ""HDRD Complex"") achieved an average utilization rate of 2,164 bbl/d, or 72% of design capacity. This compares to 2,925 bbl/d, or 98% of design capacity, during the same period in the prior year. During the six months ended June 30, 2025, the HDRD Complex achieved an average utilization rate of 2,201 bbl/d, or 73% of design capacity, compared to 2,520 bbl/d, or 84% of design capacity, in the same period of 2024.

Utilization during the second quarter of 2025 remained relatively consistent with the first quarter of 2025. The decrease during the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024 was primarily attributable to a minor fire incident on April 1, 2025, at the main renewable diesel process unit within the HDRD Complex. The fire was promptly contained, with the affected area safely isolated and stabilized. As a result, operations at the HDRD Complex were temporarily suspended, but successfully resumed on April 14, 2025. Following the restart, utilization rates steadily improved, supported by disciplined ramp-up procedures and robust operational oversight.

Tidewater Renewables continues to expect the HDRD Complex to achieve an average throughput of between 2,200 to 2,400 bbl/d for the full year 2025, inclusive of the planned turnaround activity during the third quarter of 2025, supported by ongoing operational optimizations and improving market conditions.

Capital Program

Tidewater Renewables maintenance capital for the year is estimated to be approximately $8.0 million to $10.0 million, allocated primarily to the planned turnaround activity for the HDRD Complex in the third quarter of 2025. The planned turnaround is expected to last three weeks and have a minimal impact on sales as renewable diesel will continue to be sold from inventory during the turnaround.

Additional information relating to Tidewater Renewables is available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and at www.tidewater-renewables.com.

NON-GAAP AND OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES

Throughout this press release and in other materials disclosed by the Corporation, Tidewater Renewables uses a number of non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP ratios, capital management measures and supplementary financial measures when assessing its results and measuring overall performance. The intent of non-GAAP measures and non-GAAP ratios is to provide additional useful information to investors and analysts. These non-GAAP measures and non-GAAP ratios do not have standardized meanings prescribed by GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. As such, these measures should not be considered in isolation or used as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Except as otherwise indicated, these non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios will be calculated and disclosed on a consistent basis from period to period. Specific adjusting items may only be relevant in certain periods. For more information with respect to the Corporation's non-GAAP measures, non-GAAP ratios, capital management measures and supplementary financial measures see the ""Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures"" section of Tidewater Renewables' MD&A which is available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Corporation are Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow.

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as income (or loss) before finance costs, taxes, depreciation, share-based compensation, unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts, transaction costs, and other items considered non-recurring in nature, plus the Corporation's proportionate share of Adjusted EBITDA in its equity investment.

Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to set objectives, make operating and capital investment decisions, monitor debt covenants and assess performance. Tidewater Renewables also believes Adjusted EBITDA is a measure widely used by securities analysts, investors, lending institutions and others to evaluate the financial performance of the Corporation. From time to time, the Corporation issues guidance on this key measure. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a relevant measure in this press release and the MD&A to assist analysts and readers in assessing the performance of the Corporation as seen from management's perspective. Investors should be cautioned that Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net (loss) income, net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of financial results determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of the Corporation's performance and may not be comparable to companies with similar calculations.

The following table reconciles net loss, the nearest GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA:

Distributable Cash Flow

Distributable cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital plus transaction costs, non-recurring expenses, and after any expenditures that use cash from operations. Changes in non-cash working capital are excluded from the determination of distributable cash flow because they are primarily the result of seasonal fluctuations or other temporary changes, and are generally funded with short-term debt or cash flows from operating activities. Maintenance capital expenditures, including turnarounds, are deducted from distributable cash flow as they are ongoing recurring expenditures which are funded from operating cash flows. Transaction costs are added back as they vary significantly quarter to quarter based on the Corporation's acquisition and disposition activity. Distributable cash flow also excludes non-recurring transactions that do not reflect Tidewater Renewables' ongoing operations.

Management believes distributable cash flow is a useful metric for investors when assessing the amount of cash flow generated from the Corporation's normal operations. These cash flows are relevant to the Corporation's ability to internally fund growth projects, alter its capital structure, or distribute returns to shareholders.

The following table reconciles net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the nearest GAAP measure, to distributable cash flow:

Non-GAAP Financial Ratios

The Corporation uses the following non-GAAP financial ratios to present aspects of its financial performance or financial position.

Distributable cash flow per common share (basic and diluted)

Distributable cash flow per common share is calculated as distributable cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, over the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.

Management believes that distributable cash flow per common share provides investors an indicator of funds generated from the business that could be allocated to each shareholder's equity position.

Capital Management Measures

Net Debt

Net debt is used by the Corporation to monitor its capital structure and financing requirements. It is also used as a measure of the Corporation's overall financial strength. Net debt is defined as amounts owing under the senior credit facility and second lien credit facility, less cash.

Net debt excludes working capital, lease liabilities and derivative contracts as the Corporation monitors its capital structure based on net debt to Adjusted EBITDA.

The following table reconciles net debt:

Supplementary Financial Measures

Growth Capital

Growth capital expenditures are defined as expenditures which are recoverable, incrementally increase cash flow or the earning potential of assets, expand the capacity of current operations, or significantly extend the life of existing assets. This measure can be used by investors to assess the Corporation's discretionary capital spending.

Maintenance Capital

Maintenance capital expenditures are generally defined as expenditures that support and/or maintain the current capacity, cash flow or earning potential of existing assets without the characteristic benefits associated with growth capital expenditures. These expenditures include major inspections and overhaul costs that are required on a periodic basis. This measure can be used by investors to assess the Corporation's non-discretionary capital spending.

It also recognized his role in positioning RAM as a bridge between Africa and the rest of the world.
Addou is not only a leader within Morocco but also a respected figure in the international aviation community.","Rabat – Abdelhamid Addou is one of Morocco’s most important figures in aviation. Since 2016, he has served as Chairman and CEO of Royal Air Maroc (RAM), the country’s national airline.

He was recently recognized by Forbes Middle East ranked Addou in its list of the “Middle East’s Top 100 Travel and Tourism Leaders,” ranking 45th. The magazine spotlighted his work in expanding RAM’s international partnerships and increasing its seat capacity to record levels. It also recognized his role in positioning RAM as a bridge between Africa and the rest of the world.

Appointed to his position by King Mohammed VI, Addou has led the company through an ambitious expansion plan that aims to modernize its fleet, boost international partnerships, and strengthen its position as a key African and global airline.

Born in Rabat on September 26, 1972, Addou graduated from the Mohammadia School of Engineers in 1997 with a degree in civil engineering. His early career was not in aviation but in major multinational companies. From 1997 to 2002, he worked at Procter & Gamble, followed by a marketing position at Coca-Cola.

He later moved into the telecommunications sector, joining Méditel (now Orange Morocco) as Director of the Business Division.

In 2008, Addou became CEO of the Moroccan National Tourist Office (ONMT), where he helped design and launch Morocco’s Vision 2020 for tourism, a long-term strategy to make the country one of the top 20 tourist destinations in the world.

Before joining RAM, he also served as CEO of Diana Holding, a large Moroccan agri-food group, and of SAEMOG, a tourism and real estate company.

Leading Royal Air Maroc

When Addou was appointed Chairman and CEO of RAM in February 2016, at the age of 44, it marked a new chapter for the airline. He was seen as a young, energetic leader capable of turning challenges into opportunities.

Under his leadership, RAM has pursued a strong growth strategy. By 2019, the airline was flying to 99 destinations across five continents with a fleet of 52 aircraft.

In 2023, Addou presented a 2023-2037 strategic plan that aims to grow the fleet to 200 aircraft and increase annual passenger numbers to 31.6 million.

And in December that year, RAM operated Africa’s first carbon-neutral flight using sustainable aviation fuel, in partnership with Afriquia SMDC, a first for the continent.

Addou has overseen one of the largest fleet renewal programs in the airline’s history. In 2024, RAM launched a major tender to buy 200 new planes, mainly Boeing models. By June 2025, negotiations were underway for 24 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, up to 50 Boeing 737s, and a first-ever order for 20 Airbus A220s.

Partnerships have been a core part of Addou’s strategy. In September 2023, RAM signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Air Senegal to expand cooperation in West Africa.

In March 2025, RAM signed an MoU with China Southern Airlines to develop a codeshare agreement with the goal of improving connectivity between Africa and China.

RAM has also celebrated the return of direct flights between Casablanca and Beijing, an important link for both business and tourism.

Competing with low-cost airlines

Addou has openly acknowledged the challenge posed by low-cost carriers, especially in Europe. He has positioned RAM as a service, and quality-focused airline that offers a stronger network to Africa and Europe, while Gulf carriers dominate routes to Asia.

Addou is not only a leader within Morocco but also a respected figure in the international aviation community. He is a member of the Board of Governors of IATA (International Air Transport Association), the Executive Committee of AACO (Arab Air Carriers Organization), the AFRAA (African Airlines Association), and the Oneworld Alliance Governing Board.

He has represented Africa in global aviation discussions, during which he emphasized that RAM’s growth strategy is based on realistic market data rather than overly optimistic projections.

Under Addou’s leadership, Royal Air Maroc has achieved several important milestones. In summer 2025, the airline announced a record-breaking program offering 6.6 million seats across more than 95 destinations worldwide.

In 2023, it made history by operating the first carbon-neutral flight from Africa, using sustainable aviation fuel in partnership with Afriquia SMDC. The airline has also earned international recognition for its quality of service, holding a prestigious 4-Star Skytrax rating and being named “Best Airline in Africa” by Global Traveler for two consecutive years.

To support its long-term growth strategy, RAM is in advanced negotiations to acquire 200 new aircraft, a move that is expected to significantly expand its fleet and global reach.",https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/WhatsApp-Image-2025-08-13-at-15.49.11.jpeg,N,,2025-08-14 07:56:59.810031

The news came from Johor State Executive Council Member Lee Ting Han, who shared the update in a translated Facebook post. Lee called PETRONAS “one of the pride of Malaysia” and noted that Pengerang is already home to the PETRONAS Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) project, part of the massive Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC), which is one of the largest energy hubs in the region.

Driving Johor’s green energy push

Lee said that following discussions between state officials and PETRONAS management, it’s clear this new venture will bring both economic and environmental gains. The production of SAF and HVO will help Malaysia progress towards a greener future, while helping maintain Pengerang’s reputation as a hub for sustainability and innovation.

It’s not just about the technology — the project is expected to open up good-quality jobs for locals and give Johor a head start in the fast-growing renewable fuel industry.

What it could mean for Singapore

If you’re a frequent flyer out of Changi or work in Singapore’s aviation sector, this could be closer to home than you think. With Pengerang just across the Causeway, a steady supply of SAF from Johor could help Changi Airport and its airlines meet tough international sustainability targets without paying the high costs of importing from far-off suppliers.

For the everyday traveller, it could mean flying on cleaner, more environmentally friendly planes — without ticket prices soaring from expensive fuel imports.

And it’s not just about the skies. Renewable diesel from the project could find its way into Singapore’s buses, trucks, and even ferries, cutting carbon emissions without replacing existing engines. In other words, cleaner fuel could start powering your daily commute as well as your holiday flights.

Backed by the state

Lee stressed that the Johor State Government will give its full support to ensure the refinery is a success.

“This project will not only drive the country’s green transformation, but will also create quality job opportunities, bring renewable energy technology to Johor, and strengthen Pengerang’s position as a regional energy hub,” he said.

The partnership among PETRONAS, ENI, and Euglena is being seen as another win for Johor’s position on the energy map — and a clear sign that Malaysia is serious about cleaner fuel for the future.",https://media.theindependent.sg/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0580-e1755164433459.jpeg,N,,2025-08-14 07:57:05.646548

This collaboration aims to lower carbon emissions from cargo flights while enhancing the availability of this eco-friendly fuel in the region.

Under this agreement, Cathay will provide DHL with 2,400 tonnes of SAF for Air Hong Kong flights, a subsidiary dedicated to express cargo services for DHL. The SAF will be utilized on international routes departing from major airports such as Seoul Incheon, Tokyo Narita, and Singapore Changi.

This initiative is set to continue until 2025 and is projected to cut lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 7,190 tonnes—an amount comparable to over 100 flights between Hong Kong and Singapore using an Airbus A330 freighter.

A Pivotal Move for Aviation Sustainability

Peter Bardens, Senior Vice President for Network Operations & Aviation – Asia Pacific at DHL Express, emphasized that while SAF currently represents less than 1% of global jet fuel consumption, it holds immense potential for reducing aviation-related emissions. He stated that expanding their SAF usage in collaboration with Cathay marks a crucial step towards fostering production and demand within this sector.

DHL Express is leading efforts in adopting SAF and anticipates more partners joining them on this journey toward establishing a robust SAF ecosystem across Asia. This commitment aligns with DHL Group’s Strategy 2030 goals focused on promoting ‘green logistics.’

The partnership builds upon a longstanding relationship between both companies that has supported DHL’s operations throughout Asia Pacific for over twenty years.

Air Hong Kong’s First Use of Sustainable Fuel

Tom Owen, Director Cargo at Cathay Group, noted that this agreement signifies an important milestone as it marks Air Hong Kong’s inaugural use of SAF. He highlighted that increasing the adoption of sustainable fuels is central to their strategy aimed at mitigating carbon emissions through collaborative efforts with partners like DHL Express.

This alliance also positions DHL as a strategic partner within Cathay’s Corporate SAF Programme launched in 2022. This initiative assists corporate clients in managing greenhouse gas emissions linked to business travel and airfreight operations; last year alone saw over 6,000 tonnes of SAF utilized through partnerships involving firms like HSBC and Standard Chartered.

Broader Efforts Toward Sustainable Fuel Supply

Cathay has been actively expanding its sourcing strategies for sustainable aviation fuel across various regions. Earlier this year they secured an agreement with Sinopec for supplying domestically produced SAF at Hong Kong International Airport—the first export deal from mainland China—and have also partnered with SK Energy to ensure supply continuity in South Korea through 2027.

Apart from these contracts, Cathay co-founded the Hong Kong Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition aimed at advocating policy changes conducive to local adoption of sustainable fuels.

DHL’s Global Commitment Towards Sustainable Fuels

DHL Express continues its leadership role globally by securing long-term agreements with suppliers such as Neste and bp while collaborating domestically within Japan alongside Cosmo Oil Marketing. Recently signed agreements include another contract with Neste covering an additional supply of 7,400 tonnes intended for international flights out of Singapore Changi Airport—further solidifying their commitment towards building demand across Asia’s alternative fuel landscape.

The company views these initiatives not only as steps toward sustainability but also as opportunities to enhance understanding around logistics related specifically to alternative fuels—a key growth area identified under its Strategy 2030 framework which includes developing comprehensive logistics solutions tailored towards renewable energy markets.",https://fullavantenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/98525-dhl-express-and-cathay-group-sign-new-saf-deal.png,N,,2025-08-14 08:56:39.648129

""The head of SOCAR Turkiye Enerji, Elchin Ibadov, and the head of Turkish Airlines, Bilal Eksi, signed a memorandum of understanding on cooperation in the field of sustainable fuel on August 13,"" the statement said.

The document extends the existing cooperation between the two companies in the supply of conventional aviation fuel to include SAF, it said.

""This cooperation will also lay the foundation for implementing larger-scale projects aimed at achieving regional sustainable development goals,"" it said.

Earlier this year, the head of SOCAR Turkiye's refining and petrochemical division, Kenan Mirzoyev, said that SOCAR Turkiye Enerji is exploring the possibility of producing sustainable aviation fuel at its STAR refinery.

It was noted that, in line with its development strategy until 2030, the company intends to establish SAF production from waste vegetable fats. At the same time, Mirzoyev said that SAF production would represent the largest transformation at the refinery.

SAF is sustainable aviation fuel, an environmentally friendly version of Jet-A1 fuel. It can be produced from renewable raw materials - waste cooking oils, animal fats and plant residues. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF in its pure form reduces carbon emissions 80%. SAF can be blended with conventional aviation fuel in proportions of up to 50%.

SOCAR entered Turkey's aviation sector under the SOCAR Aviation brand in 2013, signing its first major contract with Pegasus Airlines for fuel supply at Sabiha Gokcen Airport. In 2016, fuel deliveries began for Turk Hava Yollari at Ataturk Airport, Adnan Menderes Airport in Izmir, and Bodrum Airport.

The STAR refinery was commissioned in October 2018 and is designed to process Azeri Light, Kirkuk and Urals crude oil. It supplies raw materials to the Petkim petrochemical complex and creates opportunities for SOCAR to enter the Mediterranean market with its diesel, jet fuel and feedstock for the chemical industry. The refinery meets 18% of Turkey's demand for petroleum products.

The refinery's processing capacity exceeds 13 million tonnes per year. SOCAR has invested approximately $7 billion in the construction and development of the STAR refinery.",,N,,2025-08-14 07:57:30.391894

The industry must adopt propulsion technologies that can achieve zero direct emissions in flight to remain aligned with global climate objectives.

Hydrogen-electric propulsion, integrated from the ground up in clean-sheet aircraft, offers the most viable way forward for sustainable aviation.

As aviation’s carbon intensity continues to rise, traditional approaches to propulsion and aircraft architecture are falling short.

Between 2000 and 2019, emissions from aviation increased by 53% and when considering the sector’s full impact on the atmosphere – not just carbon dioxide (CO₂) – it now accounts for about 3.5–4% of total climate change effects.

Accordingly, aviation must adopt propulsion technologies that can achieve zero direct emissions in flight to remain aligned with global climate objectives, without relying on combustion or fuel sources with significant lifecycle trade-offs – such as biofuels derived from palm oil or synthetic fuels produced using fossil-based electricity.

Beyond Aero believes hydrogen-electric propulsion, integrated from the ground up in a clean-sheet aircraft, represents the most technically viable pathway. Here we outline how this architecture can scale from business aviation to regional, and eventually commercial, markets by 2050.

Why hydrogen and not batteries or biofuels?

Jet fuel delivers approximately 12,000 Wh/kg of energy, vastly more than today’s best batteries, which achieve around 250 Wh/kg. This fundamental limitation currently restricts battery-electric aircraft to subregional missions and light payloads.

Hydrogen, however, offers eight-times the energy efficiency over synthetic fuels when deployed in electric systems and a higher specific energy by weight than any battery or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) alternative.

While synthetic fuels such as power-to-liquid SAFs can be used in existing aircraft, their combustion still produces nitrogen oxides (NOx) and contrail-inducing particulates, especially at altitude. These fuels also face severe efficiency and scalability challenges, being roughly 3.5 times less efficient than hydrogen-electric architectures.

Hydrogen fuel cells, on the other hand, convert hydrogen into electricity through electrochemical reactions, producing only heat and water as outputs. No combustion means no soot, no NOx and potentially no contrails – an important consideration as aviation’s non-CO₂ impacts are scrutinized.

Designing a hydrogen-electric aircraft

To fully leverage the potential of hydrogen-electric propulsion, Beyond Aero has adopted a clean-sheet design philosophy – developing its aircraft from the ground up around the unique architecture and requirements of this next-generation power source.

Rather than modifying existing platforms, the company is engineering its first aircraft – the BYA-I light jet – as a purpose-built, hydrogen-electric aircraft optimized for both performance and manufacturability. The first electric aircraft powered by hydrogen propulsion is designed to carry six passengers up to 800 nautical miles (1,500km) – five times farther than similar battery-electric aircraft.

Loading...

Unlike retrofitted jets that suffer performance trade-offs due to additional weight and aerodynamic drag, the BYA-I integrates its fuel cells, hydrogen tanks, electric propulsion and thermal management systems from the outset. This holistic configuration enables improved weight distribution, cooling efficiency and aerodynamics – critical factors for range, safety and certification in aircraft under 8.6 tons.

Modern hydrogen fuel cells are already efficient and lightweight enough to power aircraft under 8.6 tons. As production scales, further improvements in performance and cost are expected.

Embedding digital infrastructure in aviation from the outset

Alongside new propulsion systems, the aircraft architecture must leverage digital systems by design. The digitalization of aviation has typically been layered atop legacy platforms, but clean-sheet electric aircraft enable digital infrastructure to be embedded from inception. This includes:

Sensor-rich health monitoring of powerplant and structural components.

Fly-by-wire avionics to support flight efficiency and manoeuvrability.

Cloud-based machine learning to process fleet-wide data and optimize future flights.

Edge computing onboard to enable real-time diagnostics, routing adjustments and user interface personalization.

For operators, this architecture translates into actionable benefits: automated crew scheduling, predictive maintenance and load balancing across fleets. For pilots, real-time route optimization based on weather and performance data reduces pre-flight prep and in-flight uncertainty. These are not lifestyle enhancements – they are architectural enablers for lower downtime, higher availability and more efficient asset utilization.

When integrated into the aircraft’s native software and hardware environment, digitalization becomes core to flight safety, operational efficiency and fleet adaptability.

Business aviation as a launchpad

Business aviation is the low hanging fruit of the aviation world, and is likely to be the first to see a shift towards hydrogen. Here's why:

Certification advantages: Aircraft classified under CS23/FAR23 (typically under 8.6 tons) benefit from a more streamlined and less costly certification process compared to the more stringent requirements for larger commercial aircraft.

Operational fit: More than 70% of business aviation flights are under 1,000 km and 90% are under 2,000 km – well within hydrogen-electric range capabilities.

Cost efficiency: The OEM fuel cell system eliminates high-temperature cycles and rotating assemblies common in turbines, significantly reducing maintenance requirements. Preliminary data shows over 20% lower operating costs than comparable turboprops or jet models, supported by results from Project Fresson, which demonstrated up to 50% savings in propulsion system maintenance costs, and long-term hydrogen fuel cost forecasts indicating price parity – or advantage – over Jet A-1 by 2030.

Concerns about hydrogen refuelling are increasingly addressable. As of 2023, more than 1,000 refuelling stations exist globally, with a +60% increase from 2021 to 2023.

For aviation, the recently published SAE AIR8466 report, defines best practices and engineering guidelines for setting up hydrogen refuelling systems at airports – ensuring safe handling and compatibility for both gaseous and liquid hydrogen infrastructure.

Initial deployments can be strategically focused: 15% of business airports handle 90% of global business jet traffic. Equipping the top 10 on each continent would enable over 500,000 hydrogen-electric flights annually, according to WingX and EBAA Traffic Tracker.

Roadmap to scaling hydrogen-electric aircraft

Beyond Aero’s roadmap to hydrogen-electric flight is designed to deliver early impact, support infrastructure rollout and scale in alignment with global climate goals.

From 2020 to 2030, the focus lies on foundational steps, or seed phase, including the certification of a first aircraft under CS23/FAR23 regulations – enabling a faster time-to-market through the light aircraft category. Parallel efforts address the deployment of initial airport hydrogen refuelling infrastructure, ensuring early route viability. While hydrogen-electric systems take off, SAF remains a key lever to reduce emissions in legacy fleets.

What is the World Economic Forum doing to reduce aviation's carbon footprint?

As other sectors proceed to decarbonize, the aviation sector could account for a much higher share of global greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century than its 2%-3% share today.

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) can reduce the life-cycle carbon footprint of aviation fuel by up to 80%, but they currently make up less than 0.1% of total aviation fuel consumption. Enabling a shift from fossil fuels to SAFs will require a significant increase in production, which is a costly investment.

The Forum’s Clean Skies for Tomorrow (CST) Coalition is a global initiative driving the transition to sustainable aviation fuels as part of the aviation industry’s ambitious efforts to achieve carbon-neutral flying.

Loading...

The coalition brings together government leaders, climate experts and CEOs from aviation, energy, finance and other sectors who agree on the urgent need to help the aviation industry reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The coalition aims to advance the commercial scale of viable production of sustainable low-carbon aviation fuels (bio and synthetic) for broad adoption in the industry by 2030. Initiatives include a mechanism for aggregating demand for carbon-neutral flying, a co-investment vehicle and geographically specific value-chain industry blueprints.

During the 2030 to 2040 period, the harvest phase begins. This stage is characterized by advances in fuel cell performance and liquid hydrogen storage technologies, paving the way for the development of 70-seat regional aircraft certified under CS25 standards – marking a critical step in validating hydrogen-electric systems on higher-capacity routes and expanding their relevance across regional markets.

By 2040 to 2050, the roadmap enters its consolidation phase, aimed at launching a 150-seat commercial aircraft equipped with scaled hydrogen systems. This will unlock the ability to target high-frequency, short-haul routes that currently account for up to 24% of aviation-related emissions. Addressing these segments positions hydrogen-electric propulsion as a credible, high-impact alternative to conventional jet fuels.

As an aircraft manufacturer, Beyond Aero proposes a technically feasible roadmap – from propulsion architecture and certification to infrastructure rollout – based on real-world constraints and physics. By engineering around the limits of existing energy carriers, it aims to achieve zero direct emissions in flight on missions that represent most of current traffic.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_ddreAxOEFVUlgd3Krd6iBI8efCmswdvlwDch1lAmgb0.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 07:57:35.785212

“As the IATA World Sustainability Symposium lands in Asia for the first time, we are honored that Hong Kong has been selected as the location and Cathay Pacific as the host airline. Collaboration across multiple sectors and regulators is essential for aviation to achieve its decarbonization goals, and gatherings like this provide a valuable platform for leading voices to come together to drive meaningful change. Such cooperation is especially important as the industry works to develop the ecosystem of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with Hong Kong having the potential to become one of Asia’s major centers for SAF in the future,” said Ronald Lam, Cathay Group’s CEO.

“We are at a crucial point. Airlines are fully committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. But we have not seen sufficient, timely action by policymakers, aerospace manufacturers, oil companies, or fuel producers to support this commitment. This event is an essential rallying call for all those who have a stake in air transport’s future to overcome any challenges in the way of accelerating the pace of this crucial energy transition,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

The Symposium is strategically timed. It follows the 42nd ICAO Assembly at which the industry will have advocated for stronger government policies to support aviation’s energy transition to SAF and the integrity of CORSIA. And it precedes COP30 which is focusing on turning pledges into actions. The Symposium will bridge these two global milestones with in-depth explorations of pragmatic measures to accelerate aviation’s decarbonization by:

Removing hurdles standing in the way of expanding SAF production

Attracting financing for the $4.7 trillion cost of decarbonization

While private jets account for a small share of total global emissions, the scrutiny is growing. Industry targets call for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to make up around 10 % of total fuel use by 2030, yet current adoption is still under 1 %. Regulatory mandates in Europe, new monitoring requirements, and evolving client expectations are pushing operators to act sooner rather than later.

This article examines the current state of SAF, the regulatory shifts shaping its adoption, and the operational realities for business aviation. It draws on recent data, industry reports, and regulatory updates to present a clear view of where the sector stands and what changes are likely to come.

The Simple Picture

Aviation contributes approximately 2–2.5 % of global CO₂ emissions according to Our World in Data. Within that share, business and private aviation account for 2–4 % of aviation’s emissions, based on International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) estimates.

These numbers may appear small in a global context, but business aviation’s per-passenger emissions are higher than commercial aviation (5 to 14 times higher), making it an outsized target in public and policy discussions. This is shaping regulation, client expectations, and fuel-sourcing strategies.

For business aviation flight departments, the path forward is twofold:

Reduce fuel burn on every flight. This is within operational control now.

Engage with SAF credibly—understanding supply limitations, cost implications, and the need for verifiable documentation.

What Is Actually Happening with SAF

SAF production is growing, but remains far below 2030 targets. IATA projects ~2 million tonnes of SAF in 2025, or about 0.7 % of airlines’ total fuel demand—double the 2024 figure of ~1 million tonnes (0.3 %).

Growth is slowed by:

High production costs relative to Jet A/A-1.

Limited feedstock availability, particularly for HEFA pathways.

Project delays and cancellations, as highlighted in Reuters’ 2025 investigation.

SAF is a drop-in fuel certified under ASTM D7566/D1655, typically capped at 50 % blend depending on production pathway. Certification work is underway for 100 % SAF for certain aircraft/engine combinations, but widespread approval is years away.

Where physical SAF is unavailable, book-and-claim systems allow operators to purchase its environmental attributes from a producer injecting into the fuel network elsewhere. Credibility depends on third-party verification and adherence to IATA’s SAF accounting methodology.

The Rulebook Is Tightening

Europe’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates:

2 % SAF blend in 2025.

6 % SAF blend by 2030.

Progressive increases to 70 % by 2050, with sub-mandates for synthetic fuels beginning in 2030.

ICAO’s CORSIA scheme shifts from a voluntary phase (2024–2026) to a mandatory phase in 2027, covering most international routes between participating states.

EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) changes include:

More granular monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) for small emitters.

Requirements to track alternative fuel usage.

Greenwashing enforcement is increasing. The EU’s new law restricts marketing terms like “carbon neutral” unless claims are backed by verifiable reductions, not solely offsets. In the United States, the SAF Grand Challenge targets 3 billion gallons annually by 2030.

Clarifying the “1 %” Claim

Some media coverage frames private aviation as “1 % of global emissions.” This is inaccurate. Aviation in total accounts for ~2–2.5 %, and private jets contribute ~2–4 % of that share. Communicating accurate data improves trust with clients, regulators, and the public.

Corporate Client and Board Expectations

Key shifts include:

Evidence over promises. Clients increasingly expect audited SAF certificates or documented operational savings instead of generic offset claims.

Compliance-ready messaging. EU-based customers may reject “carbon neutral” language outright without regulatory-compliant verification.

Structured plans. Decision-makers want clear, staged roadmaps combining operational efficiency, SAF integration, and residual offsets.

Operational Fuel Efficiency—Areas Within Control

1) Accurate Trip Fuel Planning

Use legal minima plus data-driven contingency reserves based on forecast winds, alternates, and anticipated ATC delays. Habitual over-fueling increases takeoff weight and cruise burn.

2) Tankering Discipline

Compare price spreads against burn penalties, emissions costs, and performance impacts. Use flight planning tools to calculate payload-range trade-offs and tankering break-even points.

3) Vertical Profile Optimization

Implement Continuous Climb Operations (CCO) and Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) to reduce level-off segments where fuel burn spikes. Use step climbs on long legs as weight decreases, and apply cost index values aligned with actual schedule constraints.

4) Lateral Efficiency

Request directs when airspace and ATC allow; even small route savings compound over multi-hour flights.

5) Ground Operations

Minimize APU usage—burn rates range from 130–225 kg/hr. Use GPU and pre-conditioned air where practical. Apply single-engine taxi when safe, reducing both fuel burn and emissions.

6) Weather and Routing Adjustments

Re-evaluate cruise altitude and speed for wind and temperature changes enroute; adjust for optimal fuel efficiency.

7) MEL/CDL Impacts

Inoperative items can alter drag or climb capability; integrate penalties into fuel planning rather than compensating with excess fuel uplift.

8) Weight Management

Audit non-essential onboard items and adjust potable water loads to reduce takeoff weight.

SAF Engagement Without Over-Promising

Physical SAF Uplift

Confirm blend percentage, production pathway (e.g., HEFA, FT, ATJ), and keep certificates with trip documentation.

Book-and-Claim Systems

When SAF is unavailable locally, purchase verified certificates through platforms aligned to IATA Accounting. Ensure traceability and maintain audit-ready records.

Offsets

Use offsets only for residual emissions after operational and SAF measures. Avoid “carbon neutral” claims unless compliant with jurisdictional requirements.

Regulatory and Cost Outlook

ReFuelEU mandates will increase fuel prices on EU sectors. CORSIA Phase II from 2027 will require mandatory MRV processes for covered flights. U.S. SAF production will grow with policy support, but volumes remain far below demand forecasts in the short term.

Putting It Into Your SOPs

Fuel Planning SOP – Define contingency tiers by route type; require sign-off for uplifts beyond set thresholds.

Flight Profile SOP – Default to lower cost index; brief CCO/CDO and step climbs; log denied ATC requests.

Ground Operations SOP – GPU/PCA by default; single-engine taxi where safe; APU limited by SOP exceptions.

SAF & Claims SOP – File blend certificates; centralize book-and-claim documentation by tail and flight number; use IATA-aligned language.

Reporting SOP – Monthly review of planned vs. actual fuel, APU usage, efficiency events, and SAF data.

Conclusion: Key Takeaways

The business aviation sector is entering a period where sustainability measures will be measured less by intent and more by verifiable outcomes. SAF will remain a limited but important tool, while operational efficiency will deliver the most immediate and dependable results.

Regulatory frameworks in Europe and internationally are moving quickly, and client expectations are evolving just as fast. Operators that build accurate data practices, apply efficiency measures consistently, and adopt SAF credibly will be best positioned to meet both compliance demands and market pressures.

In a landscape where scrutiny is increasing, credibility and precision will be as important as the fuel in the tanks.

States and international mandates are driving procurement even as federal policy is unsettled.","(U.S.) U.S. sustainable aviation fuel is growing fast in 2025, but it’s doing so under new pressure from Washington. Industry data show SAF production capacity has jumped to about 30,000 barrels per day, up from roughly 2,000 b/d at the start of 2024, even as President Trump’s early‑2025 budget cuts trimmed federal renewable energy programs tied to research and infrastructure grants. State incentives and international rules are now carrying more of the load, keeping airlines and fuel makers moving forward while policy at the federal level remains unsettled.

Policy shifts reshape the 2025 SAF landscape

Federal support is mixed. The Inflation Reduction Act’s Section 45Z clean fuel production credit still applies, but its three‑year window has spooked investors who need long horizons for big plants. The credit is being reviewed for possible extension or changes, but no final direction is set.

At the same time, agencies are signaling different priorities. The Environmental Protection Agency is still administering the Renewable Fuel Standard, with final rules expected by late 2025, yet recent proposals have leaned toward conventional biofuels over newer technologies. Official RFS details are available from the EPA: https://www.epa.gov/renewable-fuel-standard-program

The White House posture has shifted as well. The current administration has cut discretionary grants and research dollars for advanced renewables, including some SAF projects, reflecting a broader tilt toward fossil fuel development. Still, officials have said they support crop‑based biofuels, and some tax credits and loan guarantees that help those pathways remain in place. That split approach—limits on federal grants alongside continued incentives for bio‑based supply—has become a key theme of 2025.

According to analysis by VisaVerge.com, state measures and international rules are now doing more of the heavy lifting as federal signals change. Producers describe higher compliance demand from airlines and airports that need reliable volumes to meet state and overseas rules.

California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) continues to generate strong credits for SAF, helping offset federal pullbacks. Other states are weighing similar programs. These policies directly reward lower‑carbon fuel used at in‑state airports and have become an important part of project financing stacks.

Abroad, mandates are rising. The EU and UK began 2% SAF blending requirements in 2025, with scheduled increases that march toward 70% by 2050. For U.S. carriers flying transatlantic routes, that means:

Finding more supply

Signing longer offtake deals

Proving lifecycle emissions performance that meets European rules

Global aviation bodies—including ICAO and IATA—continue to push SAF as core to hitting net‑zero aviation goals by 2050. This external pressure matters: even with federal uncertainty, airlines serving Europe must show compliance and are turning to U.S. producers that can certify to ASTM D7566 and deliver consistent quality.

Industry financing follows these mandates. In early 2025, the U.S. government approved a loan guarantee to help Montana Renewables expand to 315 million gallons per year—roughly half of North America’s current SAF capacity. The move underscores how large, bankable plants with secured feedstocks and buyers still find backing, especially when their output helps airlines meet state and international rules.

Market performance in mid‑2025 has been strong. Examples include:

Neste recorded nearly 80% quarter‑over‑quarter growth in SAF sales.

Valero posted record SAF volumes.

These results mirror broader momentum seen in North America and Europe through mid‑2025.

Industry capacity and pressure points

Several numbers capture the sector’s split screen—rapid growth and real constraints:

Metric 2025 figure U.S. SAF production capacity ~30,000 b/d (mid‑2025) U.S. capacity (early 2024) ~2,000 b/d Global SAF output ~2.2 billion liters (2025) Share of U.S. jet fuel Under 2%; total U.S. jet fuel ~1.7 million b/d Global SAF (metric tons) ~2 million metric tons (~0.7% of global jet fuel) Montana Renewables expansion 315 million gallons/year

Despite higher volumes, supply is concentrated. A handful of large plants account for much of the output, with Montana Renewables now a leading producer after its 2025 expansion. That concentration can limit flexibility when feedstocks get tight or when maintenance takes a unit offline.

Federal cuts have also slowed some new R&D and infrastructure projects, particularly those that depended on grant funding. Producers say existing facilities are still supported by tax credits and loan guarantees, but pilot lines and early‑stage technology may wait for clearer federal direction or stronger state incentives before moving ahead.

The Renewable Fuel Standard remains a key framework for advanced fuels, including SAF. But with proposed volumes favoring conventional biofuels, developers of newer pathways—waste‑based, residue‑based, or synthetic—are pushing for stronger signals. Many want multi‑year certainty for Section 45Z beyond its short window, plus alignment between federal lifecycle accounting and state LCFS rules to lower compliance risk across markets.

Typical project development pathway

Producers describe a common build path with sequential steps:

Lock in sustainable feedstocks (waste oils, ag residues, crop oils).

Secure permits and financing tied to LCFS credits, Section 45Z, and sometimes USDA‑linked loan guarantees.

Retrofit or build plants able to meet ASTM D7566 and blend into conventional jet fuel.

Finalize offtake contracts with airlines and organize airport delivery logistics.

Each step is easier when policy is stable and when state and federal rules align on how to count carbon reductions.

Demand, markets, and politics

For airlines, the 2025 story is compliance and availability. Carriers serving the EU and UK must plan for rising blend rates, pushing them to sign long‑term deals now. U.S. airports in states with low‑carbon programs seek assured flows to capture credits.

Key market observations:

SAF remains scarce relative to demand, favoring large buyers willing to commit early.

States and international mandates are driving procurement even as federal policy is unsettled.

Environmental groups press for stronger sustainability filters, urging policy to favor waste‑based and synthetic routes to limit land‑use pressure.

The politics remain fluid. Support increased under President Biden from 2021 to 2024 through the Inflation Reduction Act and infrastructure funding, but 2025 cuts under President Trump changed the federal balance. While crop‑based biofuels still see support, advanced renewables face a narrower lane at the federal level. States are filling some of the gap, and international mandates are setting a rising floor for demand.

Important: Industry actors consistently cite the need for long‑term federal certainty—multi‑year credits, aligned lifecycle accounting, and harmonized standards—if today’s momentum is to translate into durable, economy‑wide supply.

Analysts forecast cautious growth tied to policy clarity:

5–10% SAF share of U.S. jet fuel by 2030 if supportive policies continue.

~3 billion gallons annually by 2030, with potential to reach 35 billion gallons by 2050 if incentives and standards stay in place and scale‑up costs fall.

Under the agreement, Cathay will supply DHL with 2,400 tonnes of SAF for flights operated by Air Hong Kong, a wholly owned Cathay subsidiary that provides dedicated express cargo services for DHL. The fuel will be used on international flights departing from Seoul Incheon, Tokyo Narita, and Singapore Changi airports.

According to the companies, the agreement will run through 2025 and is expected to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by about 7,190 tonnes — equivalent to the emissions of more than 100 flights from Hong Kong to Singapore on an Airbus A330 freighter.

“Important Step” for SAF in Asia

Peter Bardens, Senior Vice President for Network Operations & Aviation – Asia Pacific at DHL Express, said SAF remains a small part of the global fuel mix but has significant potential to cut aviation emissions.

“Sustainable aviation fuel currently accounts for less than 1% of the total global jet fuel consumption, yet air transport is one of our biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions,” Bardens said. “Our decision to expand our SAF usage in Asia with Cathay is another important step that we have taken to drive momentum in SAF production and demand.

DHL Express is at the forefront of SAF adoption, and we look forward to seeing more partners and customers join us on this journey to build a more robust SAF ecosystem in Asia. Our continued investment in this area aligns with DHL Group’s Strategy 2030, which recognises ‘green logistics of choice’ as one of the four bottom lines.”

The deal builds on a long-standing relationship between DHL and the Cathay Group, including through Air Hong Kong, which has supported DHL’s Asia Pacific network for more than two decades.

First SAF Use for Air Hong Kong

Tom Owen, Cathay’s Director Cargo, said the deal represents a milestone for the airline group.

“This partnership marks the first SAF uplift on Air Hong Kong flights, a key milestone for Cathay as we continue to expand the SAF usage across our global network,” Owen said. “SAF remains a core pillar of our strategy to address our carbon emissions, and collaboration is essential to scaling its use. We are excited to be working with like-minded partners like DHL Express to make SAF more accessible and scalable, particularly in Asia.”

The partnership also makes DHL a strategic partner in Cathay’s Corporate SAF Programme. Launched in 2022, the programme helps corporate partners address greenhouse gas emissions from business travel and airfreight. In 2024, it enabled the use of more than 6,000 tonnes of SAF, with 16 partners participating, including HSBC, AIA, and Standard Chartered.

Expanding SAF Supply

Cathay has been increasing SAF sourcing across the region. Earlier in 2025, it signed an agreement with Sinopec to supply SAF produced in mainland China for use at Hong Kong International Airport — the first such export from the Chinese mainland. It has also partnered with SK Energy to secure SAF supply in South Korea from 2025 to 2027.

Beyond supply contracts, Cathay co-founded the Hong Kong Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition to promote policy development and encourage adoption of SAF locally.

DHL’s Wider SAF Commitments

DHL Express has been a frontrunner in scaling up SAF use globally. It has secured long-term agreements with Neste, bp, and World Energy. In Japan, DHL partnered with Cosmo Oil Marketing to use SAF produced domestically for flights departing the country.

Earlier this year, DHL signed another agreement with Neste for 7,400 tonnes of SAF for international flights from Singapore Changi Airport, further demonstrating its push to build demand and supply across Asia.

The company says these initiatives will also help it better understand the logistics of transporting alternative fuels — an area it identifies as a growth sector under its Strategy 2030, which includes developing end-to-end logistics solutions for renewable energy and alternative fuel markets.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DHL.png,N,,2025-08-13 19:56:11.964289

The remaining 129 initiatives remain pending, delayed, canceled, or lack updates.

SAF is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel, made from used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and other waste. It is seen as crucial for reducing aviation emissions, a sector under mounting pressure to meet ambitious climate targets.

One notable project was operated by Boston-based World Energy, which began commercial SAF production in 2016 at its Paramount refinery near Los Angeles. The company supplied millions of gallons annually to major carriers such as United Airlines and JetBlue Airways. United’s CEO Scott Kirby hailed the 2019 contract with World Energy as an industry model for emissions reduction. However, the refinery quietly ceased operations in April 2025, and the United partnership ended years earlier without explanation. JetBlue confirmed ongoing collaboration with World Energy since 2020.

“Some airlines were engaged in a pretty disingenuous effort to put out press releases overstating their commitment to SAF projects,” said Gene Gebolys, CEO, World Energy. He did not name specific companies but acknowledged that some carriers have made sincere efforts. Gebolys also stressed the need for stronger government incentives to accelerate progress.

The Reuters review found that nearly all operational SAF projects—36 in total—use the HEFA process (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids), which converts waste oils and fats into fuel. This method is constrained by limited feedstock, restricting large-scale production.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA), representing 340 airlines worldwide, projects SAF will account for only 0.7% of jet fuel consumption in 2025, up from 0.3% in 2024. Air passenger traffic is expected to rise 6% this year, increasing overall fuel demand. IATA’s net-zero target for 2050 requires SAF usage to reach 118 billion gallons annually—more than 300 times current production.

Reuters estimates that even if all 129 pending SAF projects reach full capacity, they would supply only about 12 billion gallons—roughly 10% of what is needed to achieve net-zero goals. The industry has yet to publish a comprehensive roadmap or a transparent database to track SAF progress, leaving regulators and the public with limited insight into aviation’s sustainability trajectory.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-08/Airlines%20Complete%20Just%2022%25%20of%20Announced%20SAF%20Projects.jpg?h=02ae0a6b&itok=8IqbYk2p,N,,2025-08-13 19:56:18.842050

The British aerospace giant reported a 50% profit surge in the first half of 2025, alongside significant strides in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and small modular reactors (SMRs), sparking optimism in the market.

Let's examine how Rolls-Royce's sustainability efforts are fuelling its financial success and investor confidence.

Sustainable Aviation Fuels Market Optimism

Rolls-Royce's commitment to sustainable aviation fuel has positioned it as a leader in decarbonising aviation. In late 2023, the company completed testing of 100% SAF on all its in-production civil aero engines, a milestone that aligns with global net-zero goals.

Simon Burr, Group Director of Engineering, Technology and Safety at Rolls-Royce, stated, 'This is an important milestone, not just for Rolls-Royce, but also for the wider civil aerospace industry.'

The successful test underpinned a historic transatlantic flight on 28 November 2023, using 100% SAF on a Virgin Atlantic Boeing 787 powered by Rolls-Royce engines.

This achievement led to a 1.6% share price increase on the day of the announcement, with shares trading at £235.75 ($315.99).

The company's SAFinity programme, launched in 2025, further supports business aviation customers by combining sustainable aviation fuel investments with verified sustainability projects.

On X @RollsRoyceMENA posted, 'We shared our vision for a net-zero future, committing to eliminating operations facility emissions by 2050 & enhancing engine efficiency.'

This initiative reflects Rolls-Royce's strategy to meet rising demand for green aviation solutions, boosting investor confidence as aviation faces pressure to reduce emissions.

Financial Resilience Bolsters Investor Confidence

Rolls-Royce's financial performance in 2025 has been a key driver of its share price surge.

The company reported an operating profit of £1.73 billion ($2.31 billion) in the first half of 2025, up 50% from £1.15 billion ($1.54 billion) the previous year, with free cash flow reaching £1.6 billion ($2.14 billion).

CEO Tufan Erginbilgic attributed this to 'strong operational and strategic progress', stating, 'Our actions led to strong first half-year results, despite supply chain challenges and tariffs.'

The company raised its full-year operating profit forecast to £3.1 billion–£3.2 billion ($4.15 billion–$4.29 billion), driving shares to a peak of £1,073 ($1,437.82) on 31 July 2025, an 8.6% increase in a single day.

The civil aerospace division, powered by engine maintenance and upgrades, contributed £4.7 billion ($6.30 billion) in revenue, up 17%.

Meanwhile, the power systems segment saw a 20% revenue increase to £2.04 billion ($2.73 billion), driven by demand for data centre backup power.

These results underscore how sustainability-driven innovations are enhancing financial resilience, attracting investors seeking long-term growth.

Small Modular Reactors Expand Green Horizons

Beyond aviation, Rolls-Royce's small modular reactor (SMR) programme is a cornerstone of its sustainability strategy, contributing to its share price rally.

Selected as the sole provider for the UK's Great British Energy – Nuclear programme, Rolls-Royce expects its SMRs to generate positive cash flow by late 2025, with full profitability by 2030.

The £210 million ($281.40 million) investment from ČEZ Group has bolstered the project's credibility, with potential for European expansion.

This aligns with global demand for clean energy, enhancing Rolls-Royce's appeal to environmentally conscious investors.

The company's battery energy storage systems (BESS) also support growth, with orders from Lithuania's Ignitis Group driving a projected 20% annual revenue increase in the power systems division.

These initiatives, combined with a 46% reduction in GHG emissions from operations since 2019, demonstrate Rolls-Royce's commitment to net zero by 2050.

Under the agreement, DHL Express will purchase 2,400 tonnes of SAF from Cathay, which will be used on flights operated by Air Hong Kong, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Cathay Group. This collaboration is set to boost SAF production and usage across the air cargo sector, marking a key milestone in advancing green logistics solutions.

Expanding Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Use in Asia

The newly established SAF partnership will see the sustainable fuel used on international flights departing from three major airports in Asia—Seoul Incheon, Tokyo Narita, and Singapore Changi. These flights are operated by Air Hong Kong, which provides express cargo services for DHL Express in the region. The initiative is part of both companies’ shared commitment to lower-carbon air logistics and the long-term sustainability of the aviation sector.

The SAF deal is expected to significantly reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 7,190 tonnes. This is equivalent to the emissions produced by over 100 flights between Hong Kong and Singapore using an Airbus 330 freighter. By expanding SAF usage in the region, DHL and Cathay aim to accelerate the production and uptake of this greener aviation fuel, which currently represents less than 1% of global jet fuel consumption.

A Milestone in Green Logistics

DHL Express has been a frontrunner in SAF adoption, continually working to scale its use across its global network. The company’s Senior Vice President for Network Operations & Aviation in Asia Pacific, Peter Bardens, emphasized the need for increased SAF usage in Asia to help mitigate the environmental impact of air transport. “We are at the forefront of SAF adoption and are eager to see more partners and customers join us in building a robust SAF ecosystem in Asia,” said Bardens.

DHL’s Strategy 2030 highlights “green logistics of choice” as one of its four core objectives, underscoring the company’s focus on sustainable operations. As a result, the company is not only increasing its SAF usage but is also investing in creating a more resilient and environmentally friendly logistics network.

Strengthening Partnership with Cathay Group

This new agreement further solidifies the long-standing partnership between DHL Express and the Cathay Group. For over two decades, Air Hong Kong has been a critical component of DHL Express’s Asia Pacific network. The collaboration on SAF builds upon this strong foundation, positioning the two companies to continue working together to reduce carbon emissions in the air freight industry.

Cathay’s Director of Cargo, Tom Owen, noted that this partnership represents the first SAF uplift on Air Hong Kong flights. “SAF is a core pillar of our strategy to address carbon emissions, and collaboration is essential to scaling its use. We are excited to work with like-minded partners like DHL Express to make SAF more accessible and scalable, particularly in Asia,” he explained.

Expanding the SAF Ecosystem in Asia

This collaboration is also a part of Cathay Group’s Corporate SAF Programme, launched in 2022 to help corporate partners reduce their greenhouse gas emissions from business travel and airfreight. The program has enabled the use of over 6,000 tonnes of SAF in 2024 alone, with 16 corporate partners, including major organizations like HSBC, AIA, and Standard Chartered.

Earlier this year, Cathay also entered into agreements with Sinopec and SK Energy to secure SAF supply in Hong Kong and South Korea. These partnerships further underscore Cathay’s commitment to expanding the use of SAF within its network and fostering a regional SAF ecosystem.

DHL’s Global SAF Initiatives

DHL Express has been proactive in scaling SAF usage globally, securing long-term agreements with SAF suppliers such as Neste, BP, and World Energy. Earlier this year, DHL partnered with Cosmo Oil Marketing in Japan to use SAF produced in the country for flights departing from Japan. Most recently, DHL completed an agreement with Neste for 7,400 tonnes of SAF for international flights from Singapore Changi Airport.

DHL’s continued efforts to invest in SAF align with its Strategy 2030, particularly the “New Energy” growth sector, which focuses on sustainable energy sources like wind, solar, and hydrogen, as well as alternative fuels like SAF. These initiatives ensure that DHL can meet its net-zero emissions logistics goals by 2050 while supporting the broader adoption of sustainable energy solutions in the logistics industry.

Conclusion: A Commitment to Sustainability

This partnership between DHL Express and Cathay Group marks a significant step in the fight against climate change and showcases the role of the logistics sector in driving the use of sustainable aviation fuel. As both companies work to scale SAF usage across Asia, they are setting an example for the air cargo sector in reducing emissions and transitioning to greener practices.

With both companies leading the charge, the future of air logistics looks greener, and the push for SAF adoption is likely to continue to grow, particularly in Asia where the demand for sustainable practices is on the rise.

The small diameter trees that are thinned during precommercial thinning or wildfire mitigation activities are also regarded as forest biomass when they don’t have marketable value. Finding a market for this forest biomass, particularly as a bioenergy product, has long been a goal for the forest sector to further offset the costs of managing forestland.

“Since I got here in 2001 to do my master’s, we’ve been looking at ways to use more biomass, to deal with low-value material, and we haven’t cracked the nut yet,” said Elaine Oneil, PhD, executive director of the Washington Farm Forestry Association. “Any effort that can turn over another rock to address an emerging situation, that’s a good thing.”

The latest attempt to crack the nut is being undertaken by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) through a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Bioenergy Technologies Office-funded study that complements the Billion-Ton Reports the agency has published since 2005. These Billion-Ton Reports assess the “potential biomass resources available in the United States” — the latest report published in 2023 is the fourth assessment.

Francesca Pierobon, a chemical engineer with PNNL, who is leading this study shared via email that “Our study is related to the Billion-Ton Reports, but we are refining the analysis for biomass availability and mobilization pathways in different U.S. regions. In the first year, we are focusing on U.S. Pacific Northwest [Washington and Oregon].”

The study overview describes this three-year study as to “play a critical role in unlocking biomass potential that is currently being underutilized. Additionally, by connecting biomass feedstock producers with bioenergy producers, the proposed project will support the creation of jobs for workers and stakeholders.” A deliverable is Regional Bioenergy Guidelines, “which will incorporate key take-away messages and recommendations about how to enable deployment.”

Throughout August, the research team is holding virtual listening sessions for forest landowners, forestry professionals, agencies and Tribes to learn about the technical, economic and environmental barriers to getting forest biomass to market.

“The target of the listening sessions or outreach really has to be the harvesting and logging community because they need to know where to send stuff,” Oneil said. “And it has to be economical to do it.”

The Daily World spoke with Pierobon to learn more about the reason for this study and its deliverables; Pierobon also has joint appointments with the University of Washington School of Environmental and Forest Sciences as an affiliate assistant professor and the Washington State University-PNNL Bioproducts Institute as a research assistant professor.

What follows is our conversation edited for length and clarity.

Question: There have been other projects that have studied forest biomass for use as bioenergy in the Pacific Northwest. How does this project fit in with this other research?

Pierobon: The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between bioenergy research, community engagement, and policy analysis to understand the perspectives of the different stakeholders. These stakeholders include forestland owners, but also potentially farmers, policy makers, and industry. Their perspectives are very important to understand what are the main drivers and the barriers to bioenergy system adoption in order to identify potential solutions.

We are looking specifically at forest biomass to see how much could be available for integrating into the potential pathways that we are looking at.

Q: What are these pathways?

P: Both existing pathways and those with near-future potential that we have economic and environmental impact assessment on. Existing pathways are mainly for energy production: electricity, steam and pellet, or also biochar production. And then we’re looking at sustainable aviation fuel production; there is a lot of interest from the Department of Energy on sustainable aviation fuel production.

Q: Specifically for forest biomass, what outstanding questions are you trying to answer?

P: We’re trying to understand the perspectives of different groups regarding economic factors, as well as potentially forest health and wildfires. We also want to understand their values; for example, what could be the benefit for community development or what is most important to the different groups and if this project can fit well within that framework.

In terms of economic factors, understanding the issues with potential environmental incentive schemes and carbon payments, logistics, and what prices would actually make a difference for the different stakeholder groups when considering the cost of biomass based on different harvest options, as well as the access to the harvest sites. There is also the training and equipping staff or contractors who do the work and understanding the landowner needs, in terms of management and technical assistance.

There has been a lot of research that analyzed economic, environmental, and social impacts separately, and this study tries to bridge that gap. DOE has invested a lot on figuring out different pathways for bioenergy production and sustainable aviation fuel production but the missing part is the stakeholder perspective and they’re interested in that right now.

Q: What is the role of Washington State University (WSU) in this project?

P: The partnership with WSU is because of their forest extension program. We want as much participation from all the different stakeholders as possible. Our role is to lead the research on the economic and environmental impact assessments and partner with WSU on the outreach.

Q: For the listening sessions, what do you want each respective stakeholder to bring to the discussion?

P: For each of the sessions, there are targeted specific groups — forest landowners versus industry or agency — and there is one session where everyone is invited. There will be an initial presentation, giving a quick overview of the project and what we’re trying to achieve and then there will be a list of open-ended questions regarding different topics where we want to hear from the groups. We would like to capture as many points of view as possible and get a discussion around the most important factors of the project.

Q: From these listening sessions, what will you report back to the Bioenergy Technologies Office?

P: We would like to create a list of different perspectives from each one of the listening sessions where we understand the major concern and things to focus on as the next steps for each of the regions. And for each of the groups, what are the most important things for them and how can we address the current barriers.

Experts see significant potential for the country to tap into agricultural surpluses and align with global trends. The Ministry of Energy will issue regulations to implement the law over the next couple of months, which industry specialists say will be critical to coordinate public-private efforts and create incentives to attract capital investment with predictable returns.

Although the new legislation focuses more on biogas, it also opens opportunities to produce bioethanol and biodiesel. However, infrastructure adaptations remain a barrier. Andrés Gutiérrez, Director General and Co-Founder, CIEFSA, shared with Milenio that upgrades typically involve cleaning tanks, updating consoles, installing probes and filters, and other adjustments. “Efficient incentives are needed so that all participants in the biofuel value chain can achieve a faster return on investment.”

Industry specialists argue that mandatory blending mandates will be essential to stimulate domestic production. Currently, more than 70 countries blend 10 to 80% ethanol with gasoline, including Brazil, which has achieved substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. In Mexico, such efforts have been stalled by regulatory restrictions.

Luis Alonso González, technical Advisor to the Association for Biofuel Mobility in Mexico, told La Jornada that the government’s energy plans now include ethanol-gasoline blends for the first time, alongside a target to begin using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in 2027. One promising route for SAF production is Alcohol-to-Jet technology, which converts biomass-derived alcohols into jet fuel. He emphasized that a robust ethanol market is a prerequisite.

A robust SAF industry had promise of new jobs, domestic energy security, and technological leadership.","The One Big Beautiful Bill, passed in early July, has paralysed progress towards making aviation fuel mainstream in the US. What now?

Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill has tarnished the President’s relationship with former chum Elon Musk, but there’s plenty of collateral that hasn’t received nearly as much attention.

The Act, consistent of Trump’s ideologies packed into one neat and tidy file, has heavily targeted plans for renewable infrastructure. Already, federal funding towards developing aviation fuels has received a huge hit and the industry’s recent momentum has been lost.

Aviation is responsible for around 2.5% of yearly global carbon emissions, and there’s little prospect of that figure diminishing, given we have no viable alternatives for large, portable quantities of energy-dense fuel. An electric battery capable of powering an international flight, for instance, would be much larger and heavier than airplane fuel tanks.

Before Trump began his second term in the White House, there had been optimism about the industry’s prospects for becoming significantly more sustainable, driven by bold targets. By 2030, the US aimed to produce 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with the goal of scaling up to supply enough to power all commercial flights by 2050.

That vision now appears entirely pie in the sky, if you’ll pardon the pun.

The administration’s rollback of incentives has sent shockwaves through a sector that was only just beginning to gather steam. Promising SAF startups are already reporting delayed projects, investor pullback, and increased uncertainty around long-term viability.

Without policy stability or federal backing, the high production costs of green fuels make it near impossible to compete with traditional jet fuel, especially in a market now chock-full of deregulation and fossil fuel favouritism.

As you may recall, the previously mentioned bust-up between Musk and Trump was sparked by sweeping slashes on tax credits for electric vehicles – a financial mechanic the Tesla boss had relied on to run his EV empire. The provision has also removed this financial lever for SAF producers, creating what industry insiders describe as a ‘chilling effect’ on the industry’s innovation.

The rot isn’t just applicable to environmental goals, either. A robust SAF industry had promise of new jobs, domestic energy security, and technological leadership. With this all now resting on a knife-edge, these companies don’t have the luxury of thinking big and are focused purely on survival.

The irony is that Trump is shooting himself in the foot, too. Considering he has repeatedly stressed a desire to bring energy production home to native soil, neglecting aviation fuel rubbishes any prospect of the US spearheading a solution to decarbonising a massively-stubborn industry.

Instead, the initiative has been handed to SAF companies in Europe and Asia, where governments are doubling down on green aviation projects. France, the Netherlands, and Japan have ramped up their production targets, recognising not just the ecological imperative but the economic opportunity that comes with propelling the technology forward.

Trump may have clipped America’s wings, but it’s encouraging that other suitors are taking up the challenge.",https://thred.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sustainable-aviation.png,N,,2025-08-13 13:56:53.209219

Like the clean fuel programs in British Columbia, California and other U.S. states, the CFR assigns a carbon intensity value to fuels.
Dive Insight: Clean fuel programs in North America have provided a powerful incentive for RNG production.
“Clean fuels programs and, in general, mandates have become increasingly important for RNG to make sense,” Sriha said.
Sriha noted the jump in RNG registration follows a similar pattern seen in U.S. states that have adopted clean fuel programs.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

Dive Brief:

Environment and Climate Change Canada reported that the volume of fuel registered in the country’s Clean Fuel Regulation program jumped 417% from 2023 to 2024, an analysis by market intelligence firm cCarbon found. That’s a much larger increase than that of any other fuel included in the program, such as ethanol, biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

The surge is likely due in part to new projects responding to the recently created market incentive, said Aakanksha Sriha, an associate with cCarbon. Markets for the fuel, including utilities using it for heat and natural gas-powered vehicle fleets that have yet to procure RNG, are also demand drivers for the fuel. “It’s a watershed year,” Sriha said.

This is the second annual report from regulator ECCC, which launched its clean fuels program on July 1, 2023. Like the clean fuel programs in British Columbia, California and other U.S. states, the CFR assigns a carbon intensity value to fuels. It requires producers of certain high-carbon fuels to purchase credits generated by low-carbon fuels like renewable natural gas.

Dive Insight:

Clean fuel programs in North America have provided a powerful incentive for RNG production. That’s especially true for on-farm anaerobic digesters that process manure. Canada’s CFR program, like California’s LCFS, includes a boost to RNG’s carbon intensity score calculated from the emissions avoided by not letting manure decompose without gas capture.

The mechanism, which environmental groups say unnecessarily incentivizes factory farms, gives RNG producers a strong financial incentive to register their fuels with these programs and generate sellable credits. In Canada, fuels can also be registered both with the national CFR program and British Columbia’s LCFS, creating a stacking incentive that further boosts the value of the fuels.

Those incentives matter because the technology used for anaerobic digestion can be expensive and might not otherwise be economical, Sriha said. Additional incentives could further drive adoption of RNG in the heating and electricity sectors, she added.

“Clean fuels programs and, in general, mandates have become increasingly important for RNG to make sense,” Sriha said.

Julie Flynn, who is Canada director for RNG developer Waga Energy, said the CFR program “has acted as a catalyst, accelerating both production and adoption.” The company has four active RNG projects in Canada and one in development, and is currently fielding a bid from private equity investor EQT for a majority stake in the business.

”From our perspective, this regulation has done more than just set targets—it’s created a real market. Utilities have led the charge, but we’re now seeing corporate buyers entering the space, which is a strong signal of long-term confidence in RNG as a decarbonization tool,” Flynn said in an emailed statement.

Sriha noted the jump in RNG registration follows a similar pattern seen in U.S. states that have adopted clean fuel programs. There, incentives encourage a buildout of RNG projects once programs are implemented, due to demand for RNG as a transportation fuel. But the transportation market can become saturated after a few years as most fleets make the switch to RNG, forcing producers to need new end markets to boost demand for their fuel.

“The thing with transport is, once you’ve reached a certain percentage of blending, it becomes stable,” Sriha said.

The Canadian market has the advantage of blending requirements for fuel used for heating, which can be a long-term driver of demand for RNG. Both FortisBC and Énergir — utilities that serve British Columbia and Quebec, respectively —have set minimum RNG procurement requirements. FortisBC touted itself as the first North American utility to automatically allocate 1% RNG into its fuel mix for all of its customers in June 2024.

Quebec regulations also require 5% of the natural gas distributed to utility customers to be RNG in 2025. That requirement ratchets up to 10% in 2030.

Those blending requirements have led to deals with anaerobic digestion companies in the U.S. and Canada. FortisBC inked a 20-year offtake agreement with EverGen Infrastructure subsidiary Fraser Valley Biogas last summer. Énergir signed its own 20-year agreement with Viridi Energy around the same time.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Uwxbe7eVlfQSSQCKcexKmotB_sECNRBsJjbZxs_nZo4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9DbGVhbi1FbmVyZ3ktdGltZS1maWxsLXB1bXBzLVJOR0NORy5qcGVn.webp,N,,2025-08-13 13:56:57.769557

Biofuels Market Key Growth Drivers

The biofuels market has experienced significant growth owing to ongoing innovations in biofuel technologies, such as second-generation and advanced biofuels are enhancing efficiency, yield, and feedstock flexibility. Developments like algae-based fuels and cellulosic ethanol make biofuels more viable and scalable, reducing reliance on food-based crops, and improving the overall sustainability of biofuel production.

Another key factor driving the market growth is the transportation sector, especially aviation, and road freight, is increasingly seeking sustainable fuel alternatives to meet decarbonization goals. Biofuels, specifically biodiesel and bioethanol, have an immediacy in use since they fit straight to the engines and existing infrastructure. With their ability to reduce lifecycle emissions, they are a preferred option by environmentally conscious fleet operators and logistics companies.

Recent Developments in Biofuels Market

In May 2025, UK‑based HutanBio released a lifecycle assessment confirming its proprietary HBx microalgal biofuel achieves net‑negative emissions—removing up to 1.48 t CO₂e per tonne in Morocco, the Middle East, and Australia. This milestone marks a scalable, transparent benchmark for algal biofuel sustainability.

In May 2025, Zhejiang Jiaao Enprotech shipped its first cargo of SAF (13,400 tonnes) from its east‑China plant to Europe. This follows the award of a 2025 export license and marks the company's entry into international low‑carbon aviation fuel exports.

In April 2025, Repsol and Bunge partnered to integrate camelina and safflower crops into Europe's renewable fuel supply. Hydrotreated vegetable oils (HVOs) and sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) are derived from these intermediates, which have reduced lifecycle emissions by up to 90% and increased low-carbon crop use.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/prnewswire.com/35c459bdec4cc55ad6576b279537f54f,N,,2025-08-13 15:56:32.812149

Truth be told, both things are moonshot endeavors, and neither is really happening at scale, yet. But CO2 pipelines still have real momentum—towels are not being thrown in—and there’s overwhelming consensus that ethanol-to-jet (ETJ) simply must happen for global SAF goals to be met. These parallel industry pursuits—necessary, inevitable or both—converge in this issue through the lenses of policy, economics, science and legacy.

In “Angle of Ascent,” on page 14, we take a pragmatic look at the near- and mid-term profitability of SAF derived from alcohol. ETJ is widely expected to be a major piece of the global SAF movement—perhaps larger than HEFA, ultimately—but the profitability of making the fuel will unquestionably hinge on state, federal and international incentives. Our story is based mostly on presentations given at this summer’s International Fuel Ethanol Workshop & Expo, which took place prior to the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the 45Z enhancements housed within it (which should have a favorable impact on SAF economics). But nothing in the bill changes the fact that ETJ will require low-carbon production strategies and creative business plans that fully leverage stackable incentives for ethanol-based SAF and its coproducts.

Next, in “Unleashing Ethanol’s Potential,” on page 22, we bring you highlights and key takeaways from the FEW. The industry’s big summer event, once again in Omaha, Nebraska, was one of the best in memory with nearly 2,500 participants representing 45 U.S. states, 30 countries and, most importantly, over 94% of the installed ethanol production capacity in America. Renewable Fuels Association President and CEO Geoff Cooper gave this year’s keynote, delivering a mid-year state of the industry speech that focused on industry priorities under the second Trump administration. The policy panel that followed dove deeper into many of the same legislative and regulatory issues. And the FEW’s annual awards presentation was, once again, full of inspiring stories, which our coverage includes.

On page 28, we bring you “The Legacy of Bob Lundeen,” a piece about the life and work of the late founder of Mid America Agri Products/Wheatland, a 48 MMgy ethanol plant in Nebraska. Through the memories and reflections of Lundeen’s wife and daughter, as well as others, we get to know this special industry leader, a one-of-kind entrepreneur who made a lasting impact on not only his friends and family, but his community and, indeed, the greater ethanol industry. MAAPW is pursuing CCS, participating in the planned Tallgrass Trailblazer CO2 pipeline, which was perhaps Lundeen’s final career aspiration.

All figures, timelines, and policy references are sourced from official publications by IATA, the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, the U.S. SAF Grand Challenge (DOE/USDA/DOT), the U.S. DOT Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the IEA, and FAA/ASTM standards.

SAF’s Rise Before the Cuts

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has been gaining ground worldwide as airlines, fuel producers, and governments align on decarbonising flight. In the United States, the SAF Grand Challenge—a multi‑agency initiative led by DOE, USDA, and DOT—set two numeric goals that are publicly documented: 3 billion gallons per year of domestic SAF by 2030 and sufficient SAF (about 35 billion gallons per year) to meet 100% of projected domestic aviation fuel demand by 2050. These goals are recorded across DOE and Biomass R&D Board materials and have been reiterated by federal agencies.

The Turning Point: U.S. Policy Shift

In July 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act became law. Legal and policy advisories summarising the statute report material changes to clean‑energy tax incentives, including provisions that reduce or eliminate certain SAF‑related credits on specific timelines and alter eligibility/stacking rules. Given that tax credits have been a core driver for early‑stage SAF economics, the law represents a tightening of federal support relative to prior policy. This update reflects the verified substance of the act without extrapolating beyond publicly available legal summaries.

Where SAF Stands Today

Global SAF output remains small but growing. IATA stated that SAF production is expected to reach ~2.0–2.1 million tonnes in 2025, representing ~0.7% of total jet‑fuel needs. On emissions, both Our World in Data and the IEA place aviation at around 2.5% of global energy‑related CO₂ emissions in recent assessments. These numbers are widely cited across industry and policy sources and are consistent over the past year.

Prices and the Cost Gap

The cost gap between conventional jet fuel and SAF is well documented, but precise spot prices vary by region and contract structure. For a conventional benchmark, the U.S. DOT Bureau of Transportation Statistics reported an average U.S. airline fuel cost of about $2.32 per gallon in December 2024. Multiple industry analyses (including Argus/airlines.org dashboards, RMI, peer‑reviewed literature, and law‑firm/market notes) show indicative SAF prices several dollars per gallon higher—often in a mid‑single to low‑double‑digit $/gal range depending on pathway and credits. Because exact SAF prices are volatile and thinly traded, this draft avoids a single point estimate and instead presents the verified directional gap.

Feedstocks and Brand Involvement

SAF can be produced from waste oils and fats (HEFA), alcohol‑to‑jet (ATJ) routes using ethanol or isobutanol, Fischer–Tropsch pathways using biomass‑derived syngas, and other approved methods under ASTM D7566. Engine and aircraft OEMs—including Boeing, Airbus, Rolls‑Royce, and GE Aerospace—have public test programmes and compatibility statements for SAF within approved blend limits. Airlines such as United Airlines, British Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, Virgin Atlantic, Emirates and others have disclosed SAF purchase agreements, trials, or one‑off 100% SAF demonstration flights under special approvals. These brand references reflect public disclosures and do not rely on unverified claims.

What’s Approved to Fly

Under ASTM D7566/D1655, most SAF pathways today are certified up to a 50% blend with conventional jet fuel, with some specific pathways limited to 10%. FAA and industry materials confirm ongoing R&D to enable higher blend ratios. Commercial service flights generally use blends; neat (100%) SAF has been flown only under demonstration or special approval conditions and is not the prevailing operational standard.

The European Approach

The EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation set a legally binding SAF mandate beginning in 2025 at 2% of fuel supplied at EU airports, with scheduled increases over time (e.g., 6% in 2030 and higher levels thereafter). The EU has also advanced funding mechanisms and reference price frameworks to narrow the cost gap and stimulate supply. These details are documented by EU Commission materials and related industry guidance.

Investment Signals and Uncertainty

Industry groups and market reporting indicate that policy stability is a primary catalyst for capital investment in new SAF capacity. The combination of a global mandate trajectory in the EU and credit changes in the U.S. creates mixed signals for developers and airlines planning multi‑year offtake agreements. This section reflects verified trends from IATA communications, EU policy documents, and recent market reporting without speculating on individual company outcomes.

Implications for the Sector

For airlines, the main verified issues are supply availability, cost pass‑through, and compliance with schemes such as CORSIA for international flights. For producers, the challenges include feedstock access, capital intensity, and policy‑driven demand signals. For OEMs, the focus remains on fuel certification and preparing for higher‑blend compatibility in engines and aircraft systems. These are consistent themes across IATA, IEA, FAA/ASTM, and EU materials.

Removed or Rephrased Items

Removed: A singular point estimate claiming a specific SAF price per gallon (market too illiquid/variable for a universal figure).

Rephrased: The description of U.S. measures as general “budget cuts” now specifies tax‑credit changes and eligibility/phaseout provisions, which are directly documented in reputable legal summaries of the law.

Clarified: U.S. targets for 2050 are explicitly tied to the SAF Grand Challenge goal of meeting 100% of projected domestic aviation fuel demand with SAF, not a blanket statement that all Flights presently will run on SAF by that date.

How Brands Can Respond

Plan for blended operations: Align procurement and fleet operations with ASTM‑approved blend limits and published OEM guidance.

Diversify offtake: Consider multi‑pathway portfolios (HEFA, ATJ, FT) to manage feedstock and price risk.

Leverage mandates and incentives: Map exposure to EU mandates and evaluate the post‑2025 U.S. credit landscape to structure bankable contracts.

Support certification R&D: Participate in industry efforts to raise blend limits and cut testing/approval timelines.

Disclose with precision: Report SAF volumes, blend ratios, and lifecycle accounting methods consistent with CORSIA/EU frameworks.

The investment aims to achieve a significant breakthrough in aviation emissions reduction by supporting technology that is notoriously difficult to decarbonise.
The research team has already developed a low-cost carbon dioxide electrolyser system using transition metal and carbon catalysts, designed to integrate with the well-established Fischer-Tropsch process to produce sustainable aviation fuel.
Adjunct Professor Yun of Chuangqi Times (Qingdao) said: “This partnership is a major step towards scaling the cutting-edge electrolyser technology.
The move towards domestic sustainable aviation fuel production could mitigate these risks and underpin a more resilient, independent energy supply for Australia.","Researchers at UNSW Sydney are set to accelerate the development of a next-generation electrolyser capable of producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from renewable energy, thanks to a substantial funding boost.

The project, led by Dr Rahman Daiyan in collaboration with industry partners, is receiving over $4 million in total investment, including a $1.2 million grant from the TRaCE Lab to Market Fund.

The innovative electrolyser system transforms carbon dioxide and water into precursors that can ultimately be converted into green fuel for aircraft, offering a promising pathway to reducing the aviation sector’s greenhouse gas emissions.

The funding, provided through TRaCE (Trailblazer for Recycling and Clean Energy), a program established by the Australian Department of Education, has been bolstered by additional industry partner contributions, raising the total to $4.2 million.

The investment aims to achieve a significant breakthrough in aviation emissions reduction by supporting technology that is notoriously difficult to decarbonise.

The UNSW-led project involves Dr Rahman Daiyan, Scientia Professor Rose Amal, and Adjunct Professor Jimmy Yun, and partners with Australian company Tjindu Power and China’s Chuangqi Times (Qingdao) Technology Company, a prominent clean tech developer.

The research team has already developed a low-cost carbon dioxide electrolyser system using transition metal and carbon catalysts, designed to integrate with the well-established Fischer-Tropsch process to produce sustainable aviation fuel.

Dr Daiyan, a Scientia Fellow in the School of Mineral and Energy Resources Engineering, said: “Our goal is to revolutionise how we produce clean fuels for aviation, using renewable energy to transform CO₂ into usable fuels without requiring costly infrastructure changes.

“This technology could be the key to decarbonising aviation, one of the world’s most challenging sectors.”

Decarbonising aviation remains a leading challenge on the road to net zero, with the sector responsible for an estimated 2-3 per cent of global emissions and few viable alternatives to conventional jet fuel.

While many clean energy solutions are in development, most remain expensive, energy-intensive, and not yet ready for large-scale adoption.

Professor Amal, from UNSW’s School of Chemical Engineering, added: “This breakthrough proves that with smart catalyst design and integrated system thinking, we can transform waste CO₂ into the very fuels that drive our economy.

“It’s the kind of scalable innovation we need to tackle hard-to-abate sectors and achieve net zero.”

The TRaCE grant will help propel the project from proof-of-concept in the laboratory (technology readiness level 4) to a validated prototype suitable for real-world environments (level 6).

To support commercialisation, a spin-out company, Gurung Fuel, has been established to drive business development and engage stakeholders.

Adjunct Professor Yun of Chuangqi Times (Qingdao) said: “This partnership is a major step towards scaling the cutting-edge electrolyser technology.

“We’re not just developing a solution, we are creating a game-changer for the aviation industry, with the potential to make a global impact.”

Beyond environmental benefits, the project represents a strategic opportunity for Australia to bolster its fuel security.

The nation currently holds just 48 days’ worth of fuel reserves — well below the 90-day standard required internationally, leaving it vulnerable to both global disruptions and regional crises.

The move towards domestic sustainable aviation fuel production could mitigate these risks and underpin a more resilient, independent energy supply for Australia.",https://greenreview.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/adobestock-1359932126-1000x667-1.jpeg,N,,2025-08-13 12:57:41.493631

Aviation is no longer a luxury—it’s a necessity in our hyper-connected world. Whether for business, leisure, or logistics, air travel enables us to traverse continents in hours.

Behind this seamless mobility lies a quiet revolution in materials science: the widespread use of fibre-reinforced polymer composites. Compared to traditional metals like aluminium, these composites drastically reduce aircraft weight which directly translates into fuel savings and lower carbon emissions per passenger-kilometre.

In today’s modern aircraft, polymer composites make up more than 50% of structural components, including the fuselage, wings, empennage, and radome.

The secret behind their strength and lightness lies in their architecture: strong and stiff carbon fibres embedded in an epoxy resin matrix. Think of the epoxy as a pancake—initially a pourable liquid, it cures into a stable, irreversible solid by thermal treatment.

Through decades of innovation in design and certification, composite aerostructures have matured into industry-standard technology. But a hard truth remains: they are designed to last, not to come apart—and therein lies the sustainability challenge.

Is it a circular business?

When aviation companies showcase their environmental progress, the headlines often focus on alternative fuels: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hydrogen propulsion, or electrification. These innovations are indeed crucial.

However, what rarely enters the public spotlight is the end-of-life dilemma facing aerospace materials.

Composite structures, despite their energy efficiency in flight, are rarely recyclable. Once cured, thermoset polymer matrices resist reshaping or melting. When aircraft are decommissioned, these durable materials are mostly landfilled or, at best, incinerated, sharing a fate with wind turbine blades which use similar technologies.

Several efforts have emerged to address this. Pyrolysis and solvolysis can extract short carbon fibres from waste composites, and these can find second life in non-structural automotive or construction parts. However, these methods are energy-intensive, and they downgrade the fibre properties as well as preventing closed-loop recycling.

What this reveals is a structural contradiction: we’re applying circular economy principles to fuels, but not to the materials that form the aircraft itself. The consequence is a growing stockpile of highly engineered, high-carbon-footprint waste. If we can find ways to retain or recover the value of these materials, we not only reduce waste but also lessen our dependence on virgin petrochemical inputs.

From a performance perspective, carbon fibres remain irreplaceable. But the feedstock used to make them need not be fossil-based. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN), the standard precursor, is energy-intensive to produce. However, recent studies have shown promising routes to generate carbon fibres from renewable lignocellulosic biomass.

Additionally, polymer matrix can be engineered using renewable starting materials which possess similar properties to petroleum derived parts. If brought to scale, this could dramatically cut the embedded emissions of next-gen composite parts.

Meanwhile, several new frontlines are reshaping the sustainability landscape. High-performance thermoplastic composites offer another route. Unlike thermosets, thermoplastics can be reheated and reshaped multiple times. Their growing adoption suggests a future where structural parts could be manufactured, joined, disassembled, and reused more readily. However, their processing and raw materials still remain a significant hurdle towards sustainability.

Vitrimers are thermosetting polymers with dynamic covalent bonds. Unlike traditional thermosets, vitrimers can be reshaped or reprocessed with heat, while still maintaining excellent mechanical stability during use. This enables both repair and recycling while their composite manufacturing is compatible with current industrial standards.

Frontal polymerisation is an emerging technique that enables ultra-fast curing of thermosetting composites with minimal energy input. By localising the reaction zone and propagating it through the material like a flame front, this approach cuts down on manufacturing time and energy hence contributes to sustainable manufacturing of parts.

There is a global effort on sculpting sustainable aerostructures. While some technologies are still at low technology readiness level, their payoff at improved levels will be significant: a future in which high-performance materials no longer carry a high environmental cost.

Aviation contributed about 2.5% of global carbon emissions in 2023. It’s particularly hard to reduce emissions from planes because there are few alternatives for large, portable quantities of energy-dense fuel. Electric batteries with enough energy to power an international flight, for instance, would be much larger and heavier than airplane fuel tanks.

One potential solution, which I work on as an aerospace engineer, is a category of fuel called “sustainable aviation fuel.” Unlike conventional jet fuel, which is refined from petroleum, sustainable aviation fuels are produced from renewable and waste resources such as used cooking oil, agricultural leftovers, algae, sewage, and trash. But they are similar enough to conventional jet fuels that they work in existing aircraft tanks and engines without any major modifications.

Prior to Donald Trump’s second term as president, the U.S. government had set some bold targets: by 2030, producing 3 billion gallons of this type of fuel every year, and by 2050, producing enough to fuel every U.S. commercial jet flight. But there’s a long journey ahead.

A range of source materials

The earliest efforts to create sustainable aviation fuels relied on food crops—turning corn into ethanol or soybean oil into biodiesel. The raw materials were readily available, but growing them competed with food production.

The next generation of biofuels are using nonfood sources such as algae, or agricultural waste such as manure or stalks from harvested corn. These don’t compete with food supplies. If processed efficiently, they also have the potential to emit less carbon: Algae absorb carbon dioxide during their growth, and using agricultural waste avoids its decomposition, which would release greenhouse gases.

But these biofuels are harder to produce and more expensive, in part because the technologies are new, and in part because there are not yet logistics systems in place to collect, transport, and process large quantities of source material.

Some researchers are working to create biofuels with the help of genetically modified bacteria that convert specific raw materials into biofuel. In one method, algae are grown to produce sugars or oils, which are then fed to engineered bacteria that turn them into usable fuels, such as ethanol, butanol,, or alkanes. In another effort, photosynthetic microbes such as cyanobacteria are modified to directly convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into fuel.

All of these approaches—and others being explored as well—aim to create sustainable, carbon-neutral alternatives to fossil fuels. Exciting as it sounds, most of this technology is still locked away in labs, not available in airports.

Blends are being tested

At present, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration allows airlines to fuel their aircraft with blends of up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel mixed with conventional jet fuel. The exact percentage depends on how the fuel was made, which relates to how chemically and physically similar it is to petroleum-based jet fuel, and therefore how well it will work in existing aircraft tanks, pipes, and engines.

There are two major hurdles to wider adoption: cost and supply. Sustainable fuels are much more expensive than traditional jet fuel, with cost differences varying by process and raw material. For instance, the raw price of Jet-A, the most common petroleum-based aviation fuel, had a wholesale price averaging $2.34 per gallon in 2024, but one type of sustainable fuel wholesaled at about $5.20 per gallon that year.

The federal budget enacted in July 2025 reduces government subsidies, effectively raising the cost of making these fuels.

In part because of cost, sustainable fuel is produced only in small quantities: In 2025, global production is expected to be about 2 million metric tons of the fuel, which is less than 1% of the worldwide demand for aviation fuel. There is international pressure to increase demand: Starting in January 2025, all jet fuel supplied at airports in the European Union must include at least 2% sustainable fuel, with minimum percentages increasing over time.

Planes can use these fuels

Companies such as General Electric and Rolls-Royce have shown that the jet engines they manufacture can run perfectly on sustainable fuels.

However, sustainable aviation fuels can have slightly different density and energy content from standard jet fuel. That means the aircraft’s weight distribution and flight range could change.

And other parts of the aircraft also have to be compatible, such as those that store, pump, and maintain the balance of the fuel. That includes valves, pipes, and rubber seals. As a visiting professor at Boeing in the summer of 2024, I learned that it and other aircraft manufacturers are working closely with their suppliers to ensure sustainable aviation fuels can be safely and reliably integrated into every part of the aircraft.

Those finer details are why headlines you may have seen about flights that burn “100% sustainable aviation fuel” are not quite the full story. Usually, the fuel on those flights contains a small amount of conventional jet fuel or special additives. That’s because sustainable fuels lack some of the aromatic chemical compounds found in fossil-based fuels that are required to maintain proper seals throughout the aircraft’s fuel system.

Good promise, with work ahead

While many details remain, sustainable aviation fuels offer a promising way to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel without reinventing or redesigning entire airplanes. These fuels can significantly cut carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft in use today, helping reduce the severity of climate change.

The work will take research and investment from governments, manufacturers, and airlines around the world, whether or not the U.S. is involved. But one day, the fuel powering your flight could be much greener than it is now.

It sources crude tall oil from a nearby pulp mill, as well as from other facilities in Finland and the United States.
Olli Lahdenperä, head of renewable fuels at St1, said the market supply of tall oil is insufficient for multiple producers.
“Only about two million tonnes of tall oil is available, and just a third of that is used in fuel production,” Lahdenperä said.
Most funding has gone into electric boiler systems, but none of the projects will increase SAF production.","Petri Rekonen, director of the Lappeenranta biorefinery, said UPM has already tested the fuel in a dual-engine turboprop aircraft. One engine ran on renewable fuel produced at the plant, the other on conventional jet fuel.

“The results show our fuel performs well in aircraft,” Rekonen said.

UPM is waiting for international approval to use tall oil as a SAF feedstock. The approval process through ASTM, a global standard-setting body, takes about two and a half years. Once granted, UPM will decide whether to launch full-scale SAF production.

The Lappeenranta plant has an annual capacity of 130,000 tonnes of renewable diesel and naphtha. It sources crude tall oil from a nearby pulp mill, as well as from other facilities in Finland and the United States.

One tonne of pulp yields 20 to 30 kilograms of tall oil. Due to its limited availability, the substance is also used to produce animal feed, paints, adhesives and plant-based sterols for cholesterol treatment.

While UPM focuses on tall oil, St1 is exploring other forest-based materials. In cooperation with Swedish forestry company SCA, St1 plans a biorefinery in Östrand, Sweden. The facility would use sawdust, bark and other industrial wood residues to produce SAF and e-fuels.

Olli Lahdenperä, head of renewable fuels at St1, said the market supply of tall oil is insufficient for multiple producers.

“Only about two million tonnes of tall oil is available, and just a third of that is used in fuel production,” Lahdenperä said.

The Östrand refinery would use feedstocks currently used for heat generation. The site would also process logging residues, which are largely unused in Sweden. Half of the refinery’s output would be SAF and the rest e-fuels.

Lahdenperä said the investment, estimated in the billions of euros, would only proceed if long-term pricing support is introduced for e-fuels.

“A mechanism is needed to guarantee price stability for at least ten years,” he said. The facility could begin operations in the early 2030s.

Neste is also developing technologies to expand its use of forest waste and lignocellulosic biomass. The company already sources used cooking oil and animal fat for fuel production, but sees limited room for growth in waste-based inputs.

Carl Nyberg, head of renewable products sales at Neste, said the company is researching new feedstocks to scale production.

“We have the capability to use tall oil,” Nyberg said, adding that the firm has also studied the energy potential of lignocellulosic materials for some time.

Neste estimates that renewable fuels based on forest residues could eventually replace the energy content of 350 million tonnes of crude oil.

Since January 2025, EU regulations require all jet fuel sold at major European airports to contain at least two percent SAF. That figure will rise to 70 percent by 2050.

Marie Owens Thomsen, chief economist at the International Air Transport Association (IATA), said SAF will be critical to reaching aviation’s 2050 net-zero targets. Most production technologies are still under development or in pilot stages.

“All possible feedstocks and technologies must be used,” Thomsen said. She added that each region must rely on its natural advantages. For the Nordic countries, these include forest residues and renewable electricity.

Thomsen criticised the lack of financial incentives for SAF production. She compared the situation to early wind and solar investments, which received annual global funding of USD 150 billion during market formation.

“That same level of investment is now needed for SAF,” she said.

Thomsen also noted that current market dynamics favour fossil fuel production due to higher returns. Still, she expects SAF prices to decline in the coming years, despite an oversupply that exists today.

In Finland, investment in green energy is rising. Data from the Confederation of Finnish Industries shows EUR 233 million in fossil fuel replacement projects will be completed this year. Most funding has gone into electric boiler systems, but none of the projects will increase SAF production.

July saw a striking contrast between ambitious policymaking and the continued drag on hydrogen project delivery. Although governments in Germany, the UK and the EU have taken steps to speed up planning approvals, clarify regulations and unlock funding, infrastructure projects are still facing delays, and cancellations continue to occur. From new national legislation to final investment decisions and revised subsidy schemes, this month underscores the growing tension between policy acceleration and market execution.

This edition of Hydrogen Compass has been authored by Giulia Cannatelli (gcannatelli@westwoodenergy.com). Please do share any comments or feedback you might have. The next edition will be published in September.

Policy Acceleration: Governments Step In

Governments are clearly signalling that the hydrogen rollout must pick up speed. Germany’s Ministry for Economic Affairs proposed a Hydrogen Acceleration Act, aiming to fast track planning and approval processes for hydrogen projects, including electrolysers, pipelines and import terminals by granting them overriding public interest status – a legal designation that prioritises these projects in planning processes and shields them from certain legal challenges. The law would also include CCS-enabled hydrogen, signalling a pragmatic shift to encompass climate-neutral options amid stalled deployment.

The UK government announced it will publish an updated hydrogen strategy in autumn 2025 – its first major revision since 2021 – to improve and fast-track delivery against its 10GW by 2030 target. The update will be accompanied by a refreshed low-carbon hydrogen strategy and plans for future subsidy rounds. While the first hydrogen allocation round (HAR 1), backed only 125MW, upcoming HAR 3 and HAR 4 rounds are expected to allocate up to 1.5GW in total, alongside new support for hydrogen transport, storage and industrial decarbonisation. The UK has also launched a consultation to allow up to 2% hydrogen blending into the national gas grid, a step up from the current 0.1% cap. While this would provide a limited offtake route for electrolytic hydrogen projects, the government has clarified that the aim is not decarbonisation but rather to act as an “offtaker of last resort” – offering a guaranteed offtake for producers struggling to secure commercial buyers due to delays in dedicated hydrogen infrastructure or insufficient demand from end-users.

At EU level, RED III non-compliance triggered legal action against 26 member states, illustrating how policy ambition still outpaces national implementation. RED III requires countries to transpose renewable hydrogen targets for transport and industry into national law by the 21 May deadline. The European Commission is allowing a two-month window for countries to respond and implement the mandates. Only Denmark was excluded from proceedings, having passed partial legislation including a 0.9% RFNBO transport fuel mandate. Although Denmark did not introduce the required 42% industrial hydrogen mandate, the Commission may have deemed its subsidy regime sufficient to meet the target — or judged that its industrial profile did not warrant a mandate. Meanwhile, Finland did claim partial compliance, and Spain, France and the Netherlands have draft laws pending, but none have been formally finalised or notified to the Commission.

Separately, the European Commission published its Delegated Act on low-carbon hydrogen, introducing complex GHG accounting rules and strict methane thresholds. While welcomed for bringing regulatory clarity, the act has also drawn criticism for being overly bureaucratic and potentially deterring investment.

Project Delivery: Progress and Setbacks

Despite regulatory momentum, delivering projects continues to show uneven progress. Air Liquide made a final investment decision in July on the ELYgator project, a €500mn, 200MW electrolyser in Rotterdam. Backed by Dutch and EU funding, the project is on track for commissioning by 2027 and will supply hydrogen to TotalEnergies and other industrial users.

By contrast, the Hydric project in Puertollano, Spain – once set to deliver 200MW – has been cancelled by Repsol and RIC Energy after feasibility studies found it economically unviable. Although Repsol had been lined up as the sole offtaker and the project has received public funding, the developers cited construction challenges and high costs as decisive factors.

Elsewhere Gasunie confirmed delays to its national hydrogen backbone, now postponed to 2033, with permitting and labour shortages driving costs from €1.5bn to €3.8bn. Spain’s Enagás admitted that the H2Med corridor may not be operational until 2032.

These bottlenecks reinforce that regulatory frameworks and incentives alone cannot deliver infrastructure. Timelines and permitting remain persistent challenges.

Targeted Funding: Supporting the Right Projects

The certification, granted under both the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED-EU), was announced in Jakarta on Tuesday.

This achievement cements Pertamina Patra Niaga’s position as a pioneer in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) distribution in Southeast Asia and demonstrates its support for global efforts to cut carbon emissions in aviation.

The certification was presented by Ryanza Prasetya, CEO of PT Qualitas Sertifikasi Indonesia (QSI), to Simon Aloysius Mantiri, President Director of PT Pertamina (Persero), during a ceremony witnessed by National Development Planning Minister Rachmat Pambudy, Pertamina’s President Commissioner Mochamad Iriawan, and Pertamina Patra Niaga’s Director of Planning and Business Development Harsono Budi Santoso. The event took place in Jakarta on August 11 as part of the “Pertamina Roadmap: Advancing Energy Sovereignty through Sustainable Business” program.

PT QSI, a partner of ISCC, is the first international certification system verifying sustainability and greenhouse gas savings for all biomass and bioenergy types.

Harsono Budi highlighted that receiving ISCC certification under both CORSIA and RED-EU is a key milestone for Pertamina Patra Niaga as an SAF distributor.

“This August 2025, Pertamina Patra Niaga has once again been recognized by ISCC for compliance under the CORSIA scheme,” Harsono said. He noted that the company retains its status as Southeast Asia’s first ISCC-certified SAF Trader with Storage, a title first earned in 2024.

Last year, the certification covered only Soekarno-Hatta International Airport and Ngurah Rai International Airport. This year, Halim Perdanakusuma Airport in Jakarta has been added.

The 2025 certified facilities include the Aviation Fuel Terminals (AFT) at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Tangerang, I Gusti Ngurah Rai Airport in Bali, and Halim Perdanakusuma Airport in Jakarta.

Harsono stressed that ISCC certification is essential for supplying SAF to airlines and ensures compliance with global industry standards.

“This certification is a fundamental requirement for SAF distribution and reflects our ongoing commitment to the energy transition in aviation. We will continue to deliver environmentally friendly fuel solutions that support the sustainability of Indonesia’s aviation industry,” he said.

The milestone represents a significant step in Pertamina Patra Niaga’s mission to accelerate the aviation sector’s energy transition and contribute to Indonesia’s Net Zero Emissions target by 2060.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-1.png,N,,2025-08-13 08:56:26.171043

«Synthetic fuel can make DAC viable,» Harvey Hodd, Rivan Industries CEO

MZT’s first DAC plant, developed in collaboration with the University of Sheffield, removes 50 tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere on an annual basis, and the captured carbon dioxide is then used for the production of sustainable aviation fuel.

The company’s second UK-based DAC facility, created in partnership with O.C.O Technology and the UK Department of Energy Security and Net Zero, unlocked larger carbon removal levels that reach an annual capacity of around 250 tonnes of atmospheric CO2.

The CO2 captured via this project is fully integrated for direct use in a production process for building materials, through which O.C.O. delivers a carbon-negative limestone product.

With the deployment at Deep Sky Alpha, Mission Zero Technologies continues to diversify the end-use for the CO2 captured through its DAC systems, creating a third pathway that will serve to further de-risk the company’s carbon removal approach.

DHL Express and Cathay Group sign new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) deal to drive production and uptake in Asia

By DHL

DHL Express purchases 2,400 metric tons of SAF from Cathay Group to be used on flights operated by Air Hong Kong, an express all-cargo carrier and wholly owned subsidiary of Cathay.

The SAF will be used on Air Hong Kong flights departing from Seoul Incheon, Tokyo Narita and Singapore Changi airports.

The new agreement underscores both parties' commitment to lower-carbon air logistics and driving the production and use of SAF for the air cargo sector.

HONG KONG SAR/SINGAPORE - Media OutReach Newswire - 13 August 2025 - DHL Express and the Cathay Group have entered into a new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) partnership that reinforces their shared commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the air cargo industry. Under the agreement, Cathay will supply DHL Express with 2,400 metric tons of SAF for international flights departing from three airports in Asia namely Seoul Incheon International Airport, Tokyo Narita International Airport, and Singapore Changi Airport. These flights are operated by Air Hong Kong, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Cathay Group, which principally operates express cargo services for DHL Express.

Continuing through 2025, the partnership is expected to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 7,190 metric tons —equivalent to the emissions of over 100 flights from Hong Kong to Singapore with an Airbus 330 freighter.

""Sustainable aviation fuel currently accounts for less than 1% of the total global jet fuel consumption, yet air transport is one of our biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Our decision to expand our SAF usage in Asia with Cathay is another important step that we have taken to drive momentum in SAF production and demand,"" said Peter Bardens, Senior Vice President for Network Operations and Aviation – Asia Pacific, DHL Express. ""DHL Express is at the forefront of SAF adoption, and we look forward to seeing more partners and customers join us on this journey to build a more robust SAF ecosystem in Asia. Our continued investment in this area aligns with DHL Group's Strategy 2030, which recognizes 'green logistics of choice' as one of the four bottom lines.""

This SAF deal builds on the long-standing partnership between DHL Express and the Cathay Group, including through Air Hong Kong. For more than two decades, Air Hong Kong has played a vital role in DHL Express's Asia Pacific network. This latest collaboration builds on that strong foundation and paves the way for deeper cooperation in advancing SAF.

""This partnership marks the first SAF uplift on Air Hong Kong flights, a key milestone for Cathay as we continue to expand the SAF usage across our global network. SAF remains a core pillar of our strategy to address our carbon emissions, and collaboration is essential to scaling its use. We are excited to be working with like-minded partners like DHL Express to make SAF more accessible and scalable, particularly in Asia,"" said Tom Owen, Director Cargo, Cathay.

This collaboration makes DHL Express the latest strategic partner of Cathay's Corporate SAF Program, an initiative launched in 2022 to support corporate partners in addressing greenhouse gas emissions from business travel and airfreight through the use of SAF. In 2024, the Corporate SAF Program enabled the use of over 6,000 metric tons of SAF, with a record 16 partners participating, including HSBC, AIA and Standard Chartered.

Cathay has been steadily expanding its SAF efforts across the region. Earlier in 2025, the Group entered into an agreement with Sinopec to uplift SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland at Hong Kong International Airport, marking the first such export by Sinopec to Hong Kong. Additionally, Cathay has partnered with SK Energy to secure SAF supply in South Korea from 2025 to 2027. Apart from working closely with suppliers, the Group also co-initiated the Hong Kong Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition (HKSAFC) to collectively drive policy development and adoption of SAF locally. These initiatives reflect Cathay's mission to expand the use of SAF within its network and foster a regional SAF ecosystem.

Investments in SAF are therefore critical to ensuring its availability on a long-term and predictable basis. DHL Express has also been a frontrunner in scaling SAF uptake globally, securing long-term SAF agreements with multiple partners, including Neste, bp, and World Energy. Earlier this year, DHL Express also partnered with Cosmo Oil Marketing to use SAF produced in Japan for flights departing the country. Most recently, DHL Express completed an agreement with Neste that comprises 7,400 metric tons of SAF for international flights departing from Singapore Changi Airport, further demonstrating the company's proactive approach to driving SAF demand and supply across the region.

These efforts will also enhance DHL's understanding of how to transport these alternative fuels, as it is a segment under its Strategy 2030's key growth sector, ""New Energy."" DHL Group is developing end-to-end logistics solutions for eight segments: wind, solar, electric vehicle (EV) and batteries, battery and energy storage systems, EV charging, grid, alternative fuel and hydrogen.

The plant, 80km south-west of Seoul, will be built by the LG Chem and Enilive joint venture, LG-Eni BioRefining, and is scheduled for completion in 2027. It aims to process approximately 400,000 tonnes of renewable bio-feedstock annually.

HVO and SAF, whose demand is expected to surge driven by renewable fuel mandates, are made by hydrogenating more sustainable vegetable oils such as Used Cooking Oil (UCO) and other waste and residues through Ecofining, a technology developed by Eni in collaboration with Honeywell UOP.

Taking into account the entire product value chain, HVO and SAF greenhouse gas emissions are significantly reduced, compared with traditional fossil fuels.

“LG Chem is transforming its portfolio to build a low-carbon foundation that ensures both a progressively more sustainable growth and profitability,” said Shin Hak-cheol, CEO of LG Chem. “By advancing innovation in renewable fuels and bio-based feedstocks like HVO, we aim to strengthen our global competitiveness and meet our customers’ evolving needs efficiently.”

Stefano Ballista, Enilive’s CEO, said the Seosan biorefinery breaking ground reaffirms its strategy to offer increasingly sustainable products and position itself as a leader in biofuels production.

“Together with the plants that are already operational in Italy and in the US, and with new biorefining plants under construction in Italy and Malaysia, the upcoming biorefining plant in Daesan will contribute to reach our 2030 target to increase our biorefining capacity to over 5 million tonnes per year, with the potential to produce more than 2 million tonnes per year of SAF.”

By integrating HVO into its supply chain, LG Chem plans to reduce carbon emissions and expand its portfolio of ISCC PLUS-certified bio-circular balanced (BCB) products.

Target applications include acrylonitrile butadiene styrene for electronics and automobiles, ethylene-vinyl acetate for sporting goods, and super absorbent polymers for hygiene products.

LG Chem is also teaming up with South Korean steel manufacturer Posco Holdings to pilot carbon capture and utilisation technology that converts CO2 from steelmaking into synthetic gas for reuse in industrial processes.

The demonstration project, part of South Korea’s national CCU Mega Project, will see CO2 captured at Posco’s Pohang steelworks and processed using LG Chem’s dry methane reforming technology.

Under the deal, Cathay will supply DHL Express with 2,400 tonnes of SAF for international flights operated by its subsidiary, Air Hong Kong, from Seoul Incheon, Tokyo Narita and Singapore Changi airports.

The partnership will run through 2025 and is expected to cut lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by around 7,190 tonnes – equivalent to more than 100 Airbus A330 freighter flights from Hong Kong to Singapore.

Peter Bardens, DHL Express senior vice president for network operations and aviation, said: “SAF currently accounts for less than 1% of the total global jet fuel consumption, yet air transport is one of our biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Our decision to expand our SAF usage in Asia with Cathay is another important step that we have taken to drive momentum in SAF production and demand.

“DHL Express is at the forefront of SAF adoption, and we look forward to seeing more partners and customers join us on this journey to build a more robust SAF ecosystem in Asia.”

The agreement marks the first SAF uplift for Air Hong Kong flights and builds on a relationship spanning more than two decades between DHL Express and the Cathay Group.

Tom Owen, Cathay director cargo, said: “This partnership marks the first SAF uplift on Air Hong Kong flights, a key milestone for Cathay as we continue to expand the SAF usage across our global network. SAF remains a core pillar of our strategy to address our carbon emissions, and collaboration is essential to scaling its use.”

DHL Express now joins Cathay’s Corporate SAF Programme, launched in 2022 to support corporate partners in cutting emissions from business travel and airfreight. In 2024, the initiative enabled the use of more than 6,000 tonnes of SAF with 16 corporate partners.

Cathay has been expanding its SAF footprint across Asia, with recent supply agreements in Hong Kong, South Korea and mainland China. DHL Express has also been increasing its global SAF use, signing long-term deals with Neste, bp, World Energy and Cosmo Oil Marketing.

What is a specified source feedstock?
Under California’s LCFS, specified source feedstocks (SSFS) are byproduct fats, oils and greases from commercial or industrial processes.
Why this matters for producers The new SSFS attestation rule elevates compliance standards and places greater accountability across the feedstock supply chain.
For renewable fuel producers, the implications are serious:","As of July 2025, California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard requires renewable fuel producers using specified source feedstocks to secure attestation letters reaching back to the point of origin. This marks a significant shift in compliance expectations, creating new challenges for producers to document and verify every step of their supply chain.

What is a specified source feedstock?

Under California’s LCFS, specified source feedstocks (SSFS) are byproduct fats, oils and greases from commercial or industrial processes. Examples include:

• Used cooking oil

• Animal fats and fish oil

• Distiller’s corn or sorghum oil

• Yellow or brown grease

These feedstocks are used in pathways for biodiesel, renewable diesel, alternative jet fuel and coprocessed refinery products. SSFS pathways can qualify for a reduced carbon intensity (CI) score, making them especially valuable for producers seeking to maximize LCFS credit generation. But with this benefit comes stricter oversight, producers must now provide evidence of chain of custody from the point of origin through delivery to the fuel production facility.

The requirement in detail

Under the amended LCFS, each entity in the SSFS supply chain must now maintain a supplier attestation letter. Covered entities include points of origin, collectors, aggregators, traders, distributors and storage facilities involved from the feedstock’s origin through delivery to the fuel producer.

The attestation letter must:

1. Confirm feedstock integrity

• No additional processing (such as drying or cleanup) beyond what is explicitly included in the pathway life cycle analysis and carbon intensity (CI).

2. Verify truth and accuracy

• Feedstocks meet the definitions approved by the Executive Officer during fuel pathway validation and certification.

• Deliveries match feedstock transfer documents and are not mixed with other materials.

• Feedstocks were not intentionally produced, modified or contaminated to meet the definition of an SSFS.

3. Meet strict documentation standards

• On company letterhead.

• Separate letter for each specified source feedstock.

• Signed by an authorized representative of the supplier.

• Maintained by the supplier and submitted electronically upon request by a CARB accredited verifier, verification body or the Executive Officer.

Looking ahead, starting with the 2026 data year for all pathway reports, crop-based feedstocks will also require attestations from the point of origin through the first gathering point, including submission of farm level geographical shapefiles or coordinates—an added step that will demand both time and resources.

CARB guidance still developing

Although the SSFS requirement is already in effect, the California Air Resources Board is still developing implementation guidance. Key questions remain unanswered, particularly: what happens if a producer cannot obtain 100% of the required attestations?

It is not yet clear whether missing attestations will trigger a qualified positive statement through third-party verification, or more severe consequences. While it seems unlikely CARB will immediately classify such situations as adverse verification statements, the risk remains until guidance is finalized.

Why this matters for producers

The new SSFS attestation rule elevates compliance standards and places greater accountability across the feedstock supply chain. For renewable fuel producers, the implications are serious:",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Danielle_Anderson_6714d97a0d.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 07:57:36.240400

This equates to around £3 million (€3.5 million) per month, or £36 million (€41 million) per year.
The tariff-free quota introduced by the deal represents the entire size of the UK market.","The Government has under a week to save Britain’s bioethanol industry from collapse, leaders from the country’s biggest plant have warned.

Vivergo Fuels has told ministers that it needs a decision over its future from the Government by next Monday (18 August) or else it will be forced to start the irreversible process of closing on that day.

The bioethanol plant helps underpin £24.8 billion (€28.7 billion) in potential growth over the next 25 years for Hull and the surrounding area, with at least £7.3 billion (€8.5 billion) directly dependent on Vivergo.

Meld Energy, which has signed a £1.25 billion (€1.45 billion) letter of intent with Vivergo to build a Sustainable Aviation Fuel facility in Hull warned that without a bioethanol plant at Saltend Chemicals Park, it could be forced to look to invest overseas instead.

Negotiations between the Government and Britain’s bioethanol industry began in June and are now in their final phase.

Britain’s bioethanol industry was plunged into crisis by the Government’s decision to axe a 19% tariff on US bioethanol imports, allowing cheap, subsidised American fuel to flood the UK market.

In the just over 100 days between when the US-UK trade deal was announced on 8 May and the end of this week, the plant will have shouldered almost £10 million in losses. This equates to around £3 million (€3.5 million) per month, or £36 million (€41 million) per year.

The industry had already been in talks with Government over the UK’s unfair regulatory system that favours overseas producers, but the trade deal was a hammer blow for Britain’s domestic industry.

Bosses from the Ensus plant in Redcar, the other major bioethanol producer in the UK, joined Vivergo’s leadership in writing to the Prime Minister in May warning him their plants would close without immediate Government action as the deal rendered their businesses “commercially unviable”.

The trade agreement introduced a tariff-free quota of 1.4 billion litres, allowing US firms to sell their heavily subsidised ethanol into the British market, no longer requiring a 19% import tariff which was originally levied to help British producers compete on a more level playing field.

The tariff-free quota introduced by the deal represents the entire size of the UK market. According to the latest available UK Government figures, demand was equivalent to 1.406 billion litres in 2023.",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Time-running-out-pic-Biofuel-13-8-768x431.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 02:56:58.298542

Currently, very few refineries worldwide are equipped to produce sustainable aviation fuel.","On the occasion of World Biodiesel Day, MOL Group highlights a recent milestone in its energy transition journey. Sustainable aviation fuel has been successfully produced for the first time at INA’s Rijeka Refinery during a pilot project to process biocomponent, as well as a significant volume of renewable diesel HVO . This marks the second successful SAF and HVO production test within MOL Group, following an earlier pilot at Slovnaft’s Bratislava refinery. These underscore the company’s technological readiness and strategic commitment to alternative fuel development in meeting EU climate targets and enhancing regional energy security.

The successful pilot project at the Rijeka Refinery was implemented in cooperation with Chevron Lummus Global (CLG), the licensor of the refinery’s Hydrocracking Unit, with the aim of testing the co-processing of 5% POME (Palm Oil Mill Effluent – a by-product of palm oil production) with fossil feedstocks. During the pilot, 1,000 tonnes of biogenic feedstock were processed. The entire process was certified by the independent auditor Bureau Veritas d.o.o., in line with the ISCC (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification) standard for sustainable biofuels.

The preparation of the pilot project took eight months due to the complexity of processing a new type of feedstock and its specific physical and chemical properties. During the test run, more than 400 samples were collected for detailed analysis conducted at INA’s Central Testing Laboratory (CIL), while the biogenic content (C14 analysis) was carried out by accredited external laboratories – the Ruđer Bošković Institute in Zagreb and Isotoptech Zrt. in Debrecen.

Earlier this year, MOL Group’s Bratislava Refinery also conducted successful production tests of a diesel fuel containing HVO and SAF. HVO was produced using oil from cashew nut shells and the biocomponent produced this way was processed together with crude oil. In case of SAF, partially refined cooking oil was processed with the traditional raw material. The test proved that the Bratislava Refinery’s production unit used for the production of standard aviation kerosene is also suitable for producing sustainable aviation fuel.

MOL Group had been using the co-processing method at the Danube Refinery in Százhalombatta for years: the process reduces the emissions of traditional fuels by mixing plant residues, as the bio and fossil components are processed simultaneously directly during production.

Renewable fuels play a key role in MOL Group’s SHAPE TOMORROW strategy. The company is already a key player in both the Hungarian and regional biofuel markets, with hydrotreated vegetable oil produced from waste, i.e., renewable feedstock, being among the most climate-friendly fuel options, and ranks among the pioneers in Europe when it comes to the production of aviation biofuels.

“MOL Group already produces diesel and sustainable aviation fuel from renewable feedstocks and is ready to expand the production. This readiness underscores our strategic commitment to sustainable mobility—whether in road or air transport. For us, becoming a complex mobility service provider means offering an increasingly diverse range of fuels, thus creating all the necessary conditions for a smart energy transition for our customers. We are already playing a leading role in this process in the region, and we are determined to maintain this position through continued investments and innovation.” – said Csaba Zsótér, Senior Vice President, Fuels at MOL Group.

MOL Group is continuously researching and developing new possibilities for the production and use of biofuels. In partnership with Budapest Airport, Wizz Air, and Airport Fuel Supply Llc., MOL Group launched commercial testing of SAF in 2022 in Hungary. Building on this, the company now sells SAF as part of its regular operations in Hungary, Slovakia, and Croatia, in quantities equivalent to approximately 14 kilotons of biocomponents.

SAF can only be produced from classic renewable feedstocks (such as materials of vegetable origin) or waste, but it should meet the same technical and environmental specifications as conventional kerosene. Currently, very few refineries worldwide are equipped to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The current and projected global supply of SAF falls significantly short of demand, as reflected in prices. This is why MOL Group’s developments are of strategic importance, both from a climate protection and supply security perspective.",https://cyprusshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/New-Project-213.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 02:57:03.245968

P.A.N.”, nell’ambito di una collaborazione con Enilive e con la Ricerca e Sviluppo di Eni.

Le attività sono state organizzate e coordinate dalla Divisione Aerea di Sperimentazione Aeronautica del Comando Logistico dell’Aeronautica Militare con il contributo della Direzione degli Armamenti Aeronautici e per l’Aeronavigabilità e in collaborazione con la Leonardo.

Il progetto si sviluppa in aderenza all’entrata in vigore del regolamento ReFuel EU Aviation (Fit for 55), che a partire dal 2025 impone ai fornitori di carburante per l’aviazione di garantire quote crescenti di componente ecosostenibili (Sustainable Aviation Fuels – S.A.F) nel Jet Fuel da mettere a disposizione degli operatori aerei negli aeroporti dell’Unione Europea.

Il carburante utilizzato durante il test contiene il 30×100 di SAF, è stato realizzato con materie prime al 100×100 rinnovabili nella bioraffineria Enilive di Gela, in linea con i requisiti tecnici definiti dal Reparto Tecnologie Materiali Aeronautici e Spaziali (R.T.M.A.S.), e la Leonardo, quale produttore del T-346A, ne ha preventivamente verificato la compatibilità con gli impianti di alimentazione del velivolo per la sicurezza dell’aeronavigazione.

La miscela ottenuta è stata inoltre verificata mediante le analisi del radio carbonio dai Laboratori di ppqSense per la determinazione esatta del contenuto biogenico.

La verifica di rispondenza a normativa tecnica del carburante per l’immissione nel ciclo logistico della F.A. è stata effettuata presso il 2° Laboratorio Tecnico di Controllo di Fiumicino (RM) in coordinamento con il Reparto Servizi Tecnici Operativi (R.S.T.O.) della D.A.S.A.S. per poi essere testato in volo sul velivolo T-346A, il nuovo Addestratore della Leonardo che sostituirà l’attuale MB339 della Pattuglia Acrobatica Nazionale-Frecce Tricolori.

As the Australian Government’s biggest consumer of fossil fuels, Defence has a unique leadership role to play.

From a strategic point of view, Australia also needs to improve its energy security. That is because Australia imports a large proportion of its fuel, and the shipping lanes our nation relies on are vulnerable to disruption in the event of a crisis.

To meet its social and strategic responsibilities, Defence is making a concerted effort to transition to a more sustainable future.

That means using science and technology to increase Defence’s energy resilience while reducing environmental impact.

One way Defence is taking action is through the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), produced using components from renewable sources. Australia is rich in these renewable sources, allowing for potential domestic production of SAF.

Once blended with conventional jet fuel in accordance with fuel standards, it can be used in all types of Australian Defence Force (ADF) aircraft.

SAF is a drop-in fuel, which means no changes to aircraft or infrastructure are necessary for Defence aircraft to be refuelled with SAF.

Defence first demonstrated its use in 2023, with an aerobatic display of Air Force Roulettes fuelled by a 30 per cent SAF blend. Since October 2024, Defence has maintained a 5 per cent SAF blend in the fuel installation at RAAF Base East Sale in Victoria.

Behind the scenes, there is a small but dedicated team of Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) scientists who provide expert guidance to ensure fuels perform as intended.

'In fuel chemistry, you’re always looking for a needle in the haystack, and that needle is the thing that can turn a good fuel into a bad fuel pretty quickly, especially at elevated temperatures.'

Defence fuel chemist Dave Evans said although fuels might seem relatively simple, they can actually consist of thousands of different chemical compounds. Sometimes, a subtle change in composition drastically alters a fuel’s behaviour.

“In fuel chemistry, you’re always looking for a needle in the haystack, and that needle is the thing that can turn a good fuel into a bad fuel pretty quickly, especially at elevated temperatures,” Dr Evans said.

As the push to embrace sustainability gathers pace, the main focus of the DSTG fuels team will remain to support the ADF by making sure the fuel it is using is fit for purpose, whatever source it comes from.

Tori Guarnera is a Defence STEM cadet who works with Dr Evans at DSTG. During her work placement, she has been investigating the properties of renewable diesel fuels, made from animal fats and waste oils.

“The thing that I like about it is that it’s very relevant, because we all use fuels every day, and it’s a very important part of the Defence Force,” she said.

Ms Guarnera’s cadetship has not only given her the chance to get her hands on DSTG’s advanced chemistry equipment. She has also broadened her horizons by discussing science with colleagues.

“I thought that going into science I would be locked in a lab alone, a bit lonely, but it’s completely the opposite,” Ms Guarnera said.

“There are so many opportunities to connect with other scientists or engineers, which is a really brilliant way to learn.”

Bringing together the Australian scientific community to engage in discussions like these might lead to new discoveries, enabling Defence to strengthen energy security and reduce emissions.

Those finer details are why headlines you may have seen about flights that burn “100% sustainable aviation fuel” are not quite the full story.","The federal spending law passed in early July 2025, often called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, significantly reduces federal funding for efforts to create renewable or sustainable types of fuel that can power aircraft over long distances while decreasing the damage aviation does to the global climate.

Aviation contributed about 2.5% of global carbon emissions in 2023. It’s particularly hard to reduce emissions from planes because there are few alternatives for large, portable quantities of energy-dense fuel. Electric batteries with enough energy to power an international flight, for instance, would be much larger and heavier than airplane fuel tanks.

One potential solution, which I work on as an aerospace engineer, is a category of fuel called “sustainable aviation fuel.” Unlike conventional jet fuel, which is refined from petroleum, sustainable aviation fuels are produced from renewable and waste resources — such as used cooking oil, agricultural leftovers, algae, sewage and trash. But they are similar enough to conventional jet fuels that they work in existing aircraft tanks and engines without any major modifications.

Prior to Donald Trump’s second term as president, the U.S. government had set some bold targets: by 2030, producing 3 billion gallons of this type of fuel every year, and by 2050, producing enough to fuel every U.S. commercial jet flight. But there’s a long journey ahead.

A range of source materials

The earliest efforts to create sustainable aviation fuels relied on food crops – turning corn into ethanol or soybean oil into biodiesel. The raw materials were readily available, but growing them competed with food production.

The next generation of biofuels are using nonfood sources such as algae, or agricultural waste such as manure or stalks from harvested corn. These don’t compete with food supplies. If processed efficiently, they also have the potential to emit less carbon: Algae absorb carbon dioxide during their growth, and using agricultural waste avoids its decomposition, which would release greenhouse gases.

But these biofuels are harder to produce and more expensive, in part because the technologies are new, and in part because there are not yet logistics systems in place to collect, transport and process large quantities of source material.

Some researchers are working to create biofuels with the help of genetically modified bacteria that convert specific raw materials into biofuel. In one method, algae are grown to produce sugars or oils, which are then fed to engineered bacteria that turn them into usable fuels, such as ethanol, butanol or alkanes. In another effort, photosynthetic microbes such as cyanobacteria are modified to directly convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into fuel.

All these approaches – and others being explored as well – aim to create sustainable, carbon-neutral alternatives to fossil fuels. Exciting as it sounds, most of this technology is still locked away in labs, not available in airports.

Blends are being tested

At present, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration allows airlines to fuel their aircraft with blends of up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel, mixed with conventional jet fuel. The exact percentage depends on how the fuel was made, which relates to how chemically and physically similar it is to petroleum-based jet fuel, and therefore how well it will work in existing aircraft tanks, pipes and engines.

There are two major hurdles to wider adoption: cost and supply. Sustainable fuels are much more expensive than traditional jet fuel, with cost differences varying by process and raw material. For instance, the raw price of Jet-A, the most common petroleum-based aviation fuel, had a wholesale price averaging US$2.34 a gallon in 2024, but one type of sustainable fuel wholesaled at about $5.20 a gallon that year.

The federal budget enacted in July 2025 reduces government subsidies, effectively raising the cost of making these fuels.

In part because of cost, sustainable fuel is produced only in small quantities: In 2025, global production is expected to be about 2 million metric tons of the fuel, which is less than 1% of the worldwide demand for aviation fuel. There is international pressure to increase demand – starting in January 2025, all jet fuel supplied at airports in the European Union must include at least 2% sustainable fuel, with minimum percentages increasing over time.

Planes can use these fuels

Companies such as General Electric and Rolls-Royce have shown that the jet engines they manufacture can run perfectly on sustainable fuels.

However, sustainable aviation fuels can have slightly different density and energy content from standard jet fuel. That means the aircraft’s weight distribution and flight range could change.

And other parts of the aircraft also have to be compatible, such as those that store, pump and maintain the balance of the fuel. That includes valves, pipes and rubber seals. As a visiting professor at Boeing in the summer of 2024, I learned that it and other aircraft manufacturers are working closely with their suppliers to ensure sustainable aviation fuels can be safely and reliably integrated into every part of the aircraft.

Those finer details are why headlines you may have seen about flights that burn “100% sustainable aviation fuel” are not quite the full story. Usually, the fuel on those flights contains a small amount of conventional jet fuel or special additives. That’s because sustainable fuels lack some of the aromatic chemical compounds found in fossil-based fuels that are required to maintain proper seals throughout the aircraft’s fuel system.

Good promise, with work ahead

While many details remain, sustainable aviation fuels offer a promising way to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel without reinventing or redesigning entire airplanes. These fuels can significantly cut carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft in use today, helping reduce the severity of climate change.

The work will take research, and investment from governments, manufacturers and airlines around the world, whether or not the U.S. is involved. But one day, the fuel powering your flight could be much greener than it is now.

1. Saudi Arabian crude output growth outstripping Russian supply

What's happening? Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest crude producer, is bringing barrels back to market faster than Russia -- the largest non-OPEC producer taking part in the OPEC+ crude output agreement. While Russian output is stymied by Western sanctions imposed in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Saudi Arabia is able to capitalize on quota increases. Overall, OPEC+ crude output fell to 41.65 million b/d in July, a decrease of 140,000 b/d from June. This drop followed contingency measures to address potential supply shocks from the Iran-Israel conflict, which bolstered output in June.

What's next? If OPEC+ sticks to current plans to accelerate quota increases, analysts expect Saudi Arabia to continue to increase production faster than Russia. S&P Global Commodity Insights analysts forecast that Saudi production could be 800,000 b/d more than Russian from September, when OPEC+ plans to fully phase out 2.2 million b/d of voluntary production cuts. These cuts are being implemented by a group of eight producers, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, Kuwait, the UAE, Oman, Kazakhstan and Algeria. The group is next scheduled to meet on Sept. 7 to discuss market conditions, compliance, and compensation. It can change policy at any time if delegates think that market conditions require a change in strategy.

2. China's appetite for Russian oil in focus ahead of Trump-Putin meet

What's happening? US President Donald Trump has warned of more secondary sanctions to come for countries buying Russian energy products, after slapping a 25% tariff on India effective Aug. 7. With India widely expected to diversify its crude sources due to the additional tariff, sources said China's refineries may be able to absorb Russian supply given up by Indian buyers. Monthly Russian crude imports by China once hit a record high of 2.27 million b/d in 2023 when other buyers stayed sidelined due to the G7's price cap.

What's next? China's Russian crude volume dropped 10.4% year over year in the first half of 2025, and sources said the volume of Russian crude barrels they can absorb depends on how low the price can go and whether secondary sanctions are imposed, a Beijing-based analyst told Platts. Eyes are now on the upcoming meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who are expected to discuss on Aug. 15 how to end the war in Ukraine, and how the talks could potentially impact energy trade.

3. Mexican ferrous scrap demand to surge following ArcelorMittal's temporary shutdown

What's happening? ArcelorMittal temporarily suspended its blast furnace due to critical boiler failures, shifting to scrap-based steel production. This has prompted Mexican scrap buyers to increase bids by up to Peso 600/mt and rebar producers to announce price hikes of up to Peso 1,000/mt. The Platts assessment for Mexican ferrous scrap has risen Peso 500/mt since July 29, the day before ArcelorMittal's announcement.

What's next? With the country's only blast furnace offline, all steel production in Mexico will shift to electric arc furnaces. Market participants expect Mexican producers to absorb at least half of ArcelorMittal's production, potentially increasing scrap demand by 30,000 mt/month. This shift will likely drive further price increases as demand ramps up. The rising demand will worsen the deficit between scrap consumption and generation in Mexico, necessitating increased imports. April saw a record 137,140 mt in scrap imports and if US demand shifts toward Mexican scrap, it could compete with local supply.

4. Falling Asian imports push European renewable diesel prices above SAF

What's happening? Lower Asian imports throughout 2025 have pushed renewable diesel prices in Europe above those of sustainable aviation fuel, inverting the historic pricing relationship of the two fuels. Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, assessed the RD-A outright price at $2,290.75/mt on Aug. 6, the highest since November. It edged down to $2,277.50/mt Aug. 7 but remains well above SAF prices in the region. RD has been pricing above SAF since April, buoyed by a lack of imports. The CIF NWE Sustainable Aviation Fuel outright price was assessed Aug. 7 at $2,063.50/mt, having reached lows of $1,715.15/mt on May 7. The SAF assessment has averaged $2,292/mt since it was launched in September 2023, while the RD assessment has averaged $1,792/mt over the same period.

What's next? Renewable diesel prices in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp hub hit a nine-month high Aug. 6, as EU antidumping measures continued to curb imports while market participants report tight prompt physical supply. Further, strong demand is expected through the end of the year as obligated parties seek to stock up on volumes of advanced biofuels ahead of incoming regulatory changes stipulated in revised RED III proposals, set to take effect from 2026 onward.

5. Milling wheat sees initial price drops; quality, supply concerns persist

What's happening? The Platts Milling Wheat Marker fell to $238/mt Aug. 5, down 1.24% from July 24, marking the first decline since the new marketing year began in July. The drop was primarily due to weaker demand, but traders said concerns over quality and supply in Russia and Ukraine could limit significant declines in the short term

What's next? Russian sellers said low stocks, harvest delays and low yields in southern Russia are key factors in preventing further price declines. Producers, meanwhile, are hesitant to sell, hoping for higher carriage-paid-to bids from exporters. Despite these concerns, buyers remain optimistic about further price drops as more wheat is harvested, particularly from Russia's central and Volga regions. In July, the MWM averaged $233.21/mt, with Russian 12.5% protein wheat priced at parity and maintaining that parity so far in August.

The Asian country is negotiating a billion-dollar partnership with Brazil to boost sustainable fuels and reduce foreign dependence.

A China wants Brazilian ethanol as a central input in its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production strategy. Chinese authorities are discussing with the Brazilian government a long-term supply agreement that could generate billions of dollars, positioning Brazil as a key player in the energy transition of the world's second-largest economy.

According to the investigation of Sheet, the negotiation involves representatives of China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Federation (CPCIF), Chimbusco — a subsidiary of PetroChina — and Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (Mapa). China's goal is reach 3% SAF blend on its flights by 2030, producing 46 million tons per year, and Brazilian sugarcane ethanol is seen as the most viable alternative.

Why Brazilian ethanol is strategic for China

China faces agricultural land limitations for non-food crops and low domestic ethanol production. Among the four technological routes evaluated for SAF production—recycled oil, synthetic fuel, hydrocarbons, and ethanol—Brazilian sugarcane stands out for its high potential for scale, competitive cost and lower environmental impact.

The president Xi Jinping told the president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva that the partnership can become an example of “unity and self-reliance” among countries of the Global South. According to Xi, the cooperation will allow China and Brazil avoid rules imposed by third parties, like the United States, which has already applied high tariffs to Brazilian ethanol.

Ethanol and energy geopolitics

A China wants Brazilian ethanol not only for energy efficiency, but also as a strategic move in the face of the global trade dispute. The technical protocol for SAF standardization, currently in its final stages at the CPCIF, will allow the Brazilian product to adapt to the demands of the Chinese market.

Negotiations include bilateral green finance funds and BRICS mechanisms to reduce investment costs, as well as studies to restore degraded pastures in Brazil to expand biofuel production. The proposal is to finance projects with low interest rates and protection against exchange rate fluctuations.

Next steps of the partnership

Brazil intends to sign, during COP30 in Belém, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) for cooperation in sustainable trade. In addition to ethanol, the document should address environmental certifications for agricultural products, allowing seals such as Carbon Neutral Beef (CCN) e Low Carbon Meat (CBC) are accepted by the Chinese market.

The alignment also reinforces integration with the New PAC and Belt and Road Initiative, strengthening Brazil's presence in strategic production chains and diversifying markets for agribusiness.

Impact for Brazil

Experts point out that, if the agreement is consolidated, Brazil will be able to expand its ethanol exports, add value to production and attract investment in logistics and refining infrastructure. At the same time, it will be necessary to balance the internal supply and external to avoid impact on domestic prices.",https://clickpetroleoegas.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/China-quer-etanol-brasileiro-e-mira-acordo-bilionario-para-produzir-46-milhoes-de-toneladas-de-combustivel-sustentavel-de-aviacao-por-ano-ate-2030.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 04:56:10.235294

Hailing from 11 countries, these innovative companies will collaborate with IAG’s airlines on solutions capable of scaling across the aviation industry.

The accelerator is IAG’s flagship open innovation programme, designed to fast-track collaboration between early-stage innovators and the Group’s airlines across six focus areas: artificial intelligence (AI), automation and robotics, sustainability and mobility, experiential platforms, connectivity and next generation computing.

For the first time, the accelerator offers two tracks depending on a start-up’s readiness to deploy their solution:

Fourteen start‑ups join the Deploy Track to collaborate directly with IAG and six of its operating companies - Aer Lingus, BritishAirways, IAG Loyalty, Iberia, SOUTH and Vueling. Through Deploy, start-ups will work on a 12-week proof-of-concept to test their solutions in operational conditions. This year, almost all participating start-ups are leveraging AI technologies - which range from computer vision for baggage tracking to AI models for optimising network planning.

Fifteen early-stage start‑ups have been selected for the Discover Track, which focuses on three areas: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), carbon removals and fuel efficiency. Through Discover, deep-tech start-ups participate in tailored sessions delivered by IAG and external experts over a six-month period, gaining valuable insights for commercialising their technologies.

Ignacio Tovar, Director of Innovation, said: “We’re welcoming the largest-ever cohort of start-ups to the IAGi Accelerator, drawing on exceptional talent from across the world. We offer a unique opportunity for founders to work directly with our airlines to demonstrate the potential of their solutions. At its core, the accelerator exists to help scale the most impactful technologies for our industry, both today and into the future.”

The accelerator programme aligns with IAGi’s goal of supporting early-stage founders whose technologies demonstrate strong future potential. Over 75% of this year’s start-ups are at pre-seed or seed stage. Following the accelerator, many start-ups go on to extended trials or commercial contracts with our airlines, and in some cases, investment from IAG’s corporate VC, IAGi Ventures.

Since its launch in 2016, the IAGi Accelerator has supported over 120 companies. Past alumni have gone on to scale their technologies across IAG and the wider aviation industry, including Assaia, who specialises in optimising airport and airline operations using computer vision and AI, and Twelve, who has pioneered technology to turn captured CO₂ and hydrogen into sustainable aviation fuel.

The initiative, spearheaded by Pertamina’s refinery unit, PT Kilang Pertamina Internasional, paves the way for a more environmentally friendly aviation sector and highlights the nation’s strategic use of domestic resources to meet global climate goals.

The inaugural batch of SAF, produced at Pertamina's Cilacap refinery, is a co-processed fuel blend containing 2-3% used cooking oil. This initial shipment of approximately 32 kilolitres is destined for a pioneering flight from Jakarta to Denpasar, Bali, scheduled to take place later this month. The flight will be operated by Pelita Air, an airline subsidiary of Pertamina, serving as a symbolic and practical demonstration of the fuel's viability. The company has ambitious plans to deliver a total of 1.7 million litres of the new fuel to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Jakarta to support the upcoming trial.

The production of SAF from used cooking oil is a major step forward for Pertamina and Indonesia's broader energy strategy. The Cilacap refinery has an SAF production capacity of around 1,400 kilolitres per day, and its ability to repurpose a common waste product into a valuable, low-carbon fuel promotes a circular economy.

Globally, the aviation industry is under increasing pressure to decarbonise, with sustainable aviation fuels emerging as one of the most promising solutions. SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, and it can be used in existing aircraft engines and airport infrastructure without requiring significant modifications. Pertamina's project leverages the Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway, a commercially dominant technology for SAF production. This development places Indonesia among a growing number of countries, including those in the EU, the UK, and Singapore, that are actively pursuing SAF mandates and production. In fact, Indonesia has already set a target for international flights departing the country to use 1% SAF by 2027, with that figure rising to 2.5% by 2030 and a significant 50% by 2060.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-12 18:56:18.555114

“I’m going to need to grow 400 bushel corn to make money this year,” Rep. Brad Finstad said from the Farmfest stage during a panel on ag policy Aug. 5.

The Republican is a member of the U.S. House Agriculture Committee and farms near New Ulm, Minnesota.

A stronger market for ag products is one answer he sees for low crop prices.

“We want to farm for a market,” he said. “We don’t want to farm to run down our driveway to the mailbox to see what the government is going to put in our mailbox to help us succeed for another year.”

His comments came shortly after the newly confirmed Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Stephen Vaden lauded the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s work to deliver assistance for economic and weather disasters. That included nearly $8 billion in Emergency Commodity Assistance Program money that went to more than 571,000 farmers across 49 states, according to Vaden.

“At USDA, we are mindful that farm economy is not where it should be,” he said.

The agency has been working with President Donald Trump to negotiate trade deals, he said. That includes an agreement with the United Kingdom to buy more American livestock and ethanol and putting pressure on Canada to allow American dairy products across the border.

An agreement with the European Union in late July will pave the way for easier imports of pork and dairy to European countries. Another agreement with Japan will increase U.S. rice imports there by 75% in addition to Japan’s promise to buy $8 billion in U.S. goods. Those goods include corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol and sustainable aviation fuel.

Speaking ahead of the afternoon panel on the Farmfest stage, Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said trade is big for Minnesota as the nation’s fourth largest ag exporter, but more than 100 tariff changes in the last few months have affected the state’s economy.

Fellow Democratic Rep. Angie Craig of District 2 also doesn’t like tariffs as a negotiating tactic, calling them a “new tax on Americans.”

Craig is a ranking member of the House Agriculture Committee, and while she’s pleased to see updates to crop insurance, tax deductions and reference prices in the One Big Beautiful Bill signed July 4, she said those issues should have been taken care of with a new farm bill. Klobuchar also criticized the Big Beautiful Bill for favoring Southern crops like peanuts over corn and soybeans.

Rep. Pete Stauber, R-District 8, from Duluth, said the bill is not perfect, but it’s very good legislation, focusing his comments on new work requirements for Medicaid and efforts to remove non-citizens from the program that were part of the bill.

Vaden said the bill will protect farmers’ operations for “years to come,” thanks to safety net programs, more certainty in the tax code and removal of the death tax for more families.

“Because of that, people can continue to farm,” he said. “That is exactly what farm policy should do.”

Six years later, that collaboration is dead.

Boston-based World Energy was one of the first companies in the world to produce commercial quantities of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a type of renewable fuel made from sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues and other waste.

Its Paramount refinery near downtown Los Angeles had been a rare success story, supplying millions of gallons of SAF a year to airlines such as United Airlines and fellow US carrier JetBlue Airways. The plant, which began operations in 2016, was central to the carriers' pledges to help the airline industry switch to a blend of 10 per cent SAF by the end of this decade.

But the refinery quietly ceased operations in April. And World Energy's plans for a second plant in Houston have stalled amid a lack of commitment from the industry, according to Chief Executive Gene Gebolys.

""Some airlines were engaged in a pretty disingenuous effort to put out press releases"" overstating their commitment to SAF projects, Gebolys said, without naming any companies. ""People sometimes said too much in the past and did too little.""

Still, Gebolys acknowledged that some airlines have made a genuine effort to support SAF producers, while governments also needed to step up with stronger incentives to drive progress.

The termination of United's fuel purchase contract with World Energy - and the closure of the Paramount refinery - have not previously been reported.

United Airlines said it ended its relationship with World Energy ""a few years ago"", without providing a reason. A JetBlue spokesperson said World Energy has been a ""valued partner"" since 2020 and it will continue working with the company.

World Energy's struggles mirror the plight of dozens of clean fuel startups, according to a Reuters review of the sector. Nearly 20 years after the first commercial flight powered partly by biofuels made the short hop from London to Amsterdam, Reuters found that the airline industry's plans to go green before regulators start penalising them are little more than a pipe dream.

No clear pathway

The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a global body that represents 340 airlines, forecasts SAF will account for 0.7 per cent of total jet fuel this year, up from 0.3 per cent in 2024. Air passenger traffic, meanwhile, is expected to rise 6 per cent this year, IATA says.

IATA has set a goal of net zero emissions by 2050, a target that would require airlines to ramp up SAF use to 118 billion gallons annually, a more than 300-fold increase from current production.

Airline industry leaders point to a wave of new SAF initiatives they say will spark a boom similar to the rapid rise of electric vehicles and solar energy.

However, the aviation sector has yet to publish a comprehensive roadmap or a transparent database of upcoming SAF projects that would allow regulators and the public to assess the credibility of these projections.

To scrutinise the industry's claims, Reuters built its own database of airline SAF initiatives - offering the most comprehensive view yet of the sector's faltering green progress and revealing that the industry has no clear pathway to hitting net zero targets.

While airlines have announced 165 SAF projects over the past 12 years, only 36 have materialised, Reuters found. Among those, Reuters uncovered problems at three of the largest - including World Energy - that exemplify the systemic challenges plaguing the SAF sector.

Of the remaining projects, 23 have been abandoned, 27 are delayed or on indefinite hold, 31 have yet to produce any fuel, and 4 are SAF credit deals, where no physical fuel is delivered.

For the other 44 projects, Reuters was unable to find any public updates since their initial announcements.

If all the pending projects announced by airlines reached their maximum potential, it would only add 12 billion gallons of SAF production, the Reuters analysis found. That's about 10 per cent of what's needed to hit the net zero target.

Airlines pin the problems on the oil industry, saying it isn't producing enough fuel.

""These guys are the cause of the problem, and they've got to start playing their part,"" said Willie Walsh, director of IATA, the global airline lobby, and a former chief executive of British Airways and its parent International Airlines Group .

At the moment, SAF costs three to five times more than jet fuel and some oil company executives argue that there is limited demand from airlines at current prices.

""I'd like there to be a shortage. I actually see an overcapacity,"" Bernard Pinatel, the head of downstream and marketing and services at TotalEnergies, told a press briefing in June.

Paramount 'reset'

The Paramount refinery, which used cooking oil and animal fat from a local abattoir to make fuel, repeatedly stumbled in its efforts to expand and all 35 employees were laid off in April, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.

The future of the plant is uncertain, the two people said, after World Energy's partner, Air Products, withdrew from the project in February, citing challenging commercial conditions tied to the expansion and operations. Air Products, a US industrial gases and chemicals company, had been slated to lead a $2 billion expansion of the site.

World Energy CEO Gebolys said Paramount's closure was a ""reset"" because the refurbishment was over budget and behind schedule. He said it would come back online, without giving a time frame. He declined to comment about the layoffs.

According to more than a dozen people directly involved in the sector, airlines play minimal roles in the execution of projects and, in most cases, their only commitment is to buy SAF when their partners produce it.

What's more, airlines are making bold projections about SAF use and emissions reductions based on unproven technologies or early-stage projects run by startups with no experience of commercial production, Reuters found.

Of the 36 projects that have produced any SAF, all but one rely on the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process to convert waste oils, fats and grease into jet fuel. HEFA was the technology used at Paramount.

However, HEFA plants are severely constrained by the limited availability of suitable raw materials and cannot meet the industry's long-term fuel demands, three industry specialists said.

IATA chief economist and sustainability executive Marie Owens Thomsen disputed the idea airlines only play a minimal role, saying they were striking SAF purchase agreements and investing in new technologies, supporting early-stage innovation and collaborating with research institutions.

She also said alternative ways of making SAF needed to be developed alongside HEFA, as this process alone would not be sufficient to produce enough fuel to hit net zero by 2050.

'Exercise in futility'

Aviation accounts for 2.5 per cent of global emissions of planet-warming gases such as carbon dioxide. This figure is expected to rise as air traffic more than doubles from 2019 levels by 2050 and fuel use rises 59 per cent, according to environmental advocacy group Transport & Environment (T&E).

By painting a picture of imminent breakthroughs and success in producing SAF at scale, airlines can bolster their green credentials while deflecting pressure for more disruptive interventions, such as stricter emissions caps or higher carbon taxes, the group said.

""This is first and foremost about justifying never-ending growth and pretending that you can do that without heating the planet more and more - which you cannot do,"" said Almuth Ernsting, a campaigner with advocacy group Biofuelwatch.

Failing to find a solution could prove costly. Under new EU rules, airlines face escalating mandates to use SAF on flights departing from EU airports. The mandate starts with at least 2 per cent of their fuel in 2025, climbing to 6 per cent by 2030, and eventually hitting 70 per cent by 2050.

European SAF mandates are expected to cost airlines $2.9 billion in additional fuel purchases and compliance expenses this year, according to IATA estimates.

The return to power of US President Donald Trump could further hamper the industry's green transition. Trump has pledged to roll back many incentives his predecessor, Joe Biden, offered to SAF and other green energy projects.

As projects flounder in the United States, the US airline industry has pinned hopes on a new SAF bonanza in Panama. It's already hitting the skids, Reuters found.

SGP BioEnergy, headquartered in New York, pledged in 2022 to build the world's largest SAF facility, in collaboration with the government of Panama. The plant is to make green fuel from industrial hemp oil and used cooking oil.

Due to start this year, production has been pushed back to 2027. SGP BioEnergy Chief Executive Randy Letang said the delay was largely due to airlines showing less interest in backing SAF projects than in the past.

Panama's energy secretary did not respond to a request for comment.

After the plant opens, the company may switch to making renewable diesel for trucks and ships, because those industries showed more enthusiasm than aviation, Letang said.

""We're only going to take it so far with SAF until we determine whether or not the airlines are actually serious about making the commitments for this fuel,"" he said.

Letang said airlines were competing to announce their own marquee projects, when producers actually needed consortiums made up of many carriers to invest in large-scale projects.

""That's how you build this industry. Without that, it's an exercise in futility, quite frankly,"" he said. ""The airlines could do a lot more.""

A few years ago, Letang was striking big SAF deals with major airlines through his previous biofuels venture, SG Preston. In 2016, JetBlue announced a 10-year commitment to buy commercial volumes of green fuel from SG Preston, calling it one of the largest such deals in history. JetBlue said in 2021 it would double down on the deal as it pursued a target to use SAF for 8 per cent of its fuel needs by 2023.

Australia's Qantas Airways signed a similar 10-year deal with SG Preston in 2017 for 8 million gallons of SAF annually starting in 2020 to help power flights between Los Angeles and Australia.

The deals were based on SG Preston's plan to build five plants across North America - two in Ohio and one each in Indiana, Michigan, and Ontario. None has been built.

SG Preston filed for bankruptcy in 2022, according to company filings. A spokesperson for Letang's current firm, SGP BioEnergy, said the two companies had no affiliation.

New technology

While most SAF projects rely on HEFA, British startup Velocys uses Fischer-Tropsch technology, which converts waste such as garbage, wood chips, or flared gas into clean fuel.

IAG - the parent of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus - has been an enthusiastic backer, announcing four major SAF initiatives with Velocys over the past 15 years. But despite producing SAF in pilot projects, none of the Velocys projects has reached commercial production.

Its challenges began in 2010 with a project to turn methane from a London landfill into jet fuel. That venture collapsed when its main backer went bankrupt.

Since then Velocys has attempted to build its own plants - including in Oklahoma - but it has proven too costly and technically challenging.

After shutting the Oklahoma plant, Velocys shifted focus to two new projects: one at Immingham in northeast England and another in Mississippi.

British oil major Shell and IAG initially backed Velocys's English venture, and the British government awarded a £27 million ($37 million) grant in 2022, then another £3 million in July. However, Shell backed out in 2021 to pursue its own SAF ventures. Shell declined further comment.

While IAG has no purchase deal with Velocys, it maintains a partnership and expects production to begin in 2029.

Velocys Chief Executive Matthew Viergutz remains optimistic, saying the company has learned from past setbacks. However, the Mississippi project is on hold pending clarity on US SAF regulations.

The Immingham project was meant to start supplying British Airways last year. The plant site is a dusty field, empty but for a blue portable toilet lying on its side.

Velocys has yet to sell a drop of green jet fuel to IAG or any other airline.","https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-123251908,imgsize-901320,width-1200,height=627,overlay-etinfra,resizemode-75/news/aviation/airlines-sustainable-fuel-plans-unravel-as-major-projects-fail.jpg",N,,2025-08-12 12:56:30.321414

The breakthrough in producing jet fuel from sunlight and air marks a significant milestone in the quest for sustainable aviation.","In a groundbreaking development that could reshape the aviation industry, Swiss scientists have successfully created a process to produce carbon-neutral jet fuel using sunlight and air. This innovation holds the potential to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of aviation, which currently accounts for nearly 3% of global CO2 emissions. The new method, developed by researchers at ETH Zurich, uses solar energy to convert carbon dioxide and water from the air into syngas, which is subsequently transformed into kerosene and methanol. As the world grapples with climate change, this advancement could become a cornerstone in the global effort to decarbonize transportation, providing a sustainable alternative to traditional jet fuels.

Harnessing Solar Power for Sustainable Fuels

The process developed by Swiss scientists revolves around a state-of-the-art industrial plant that extracts carbon dioxide and water from the air, using solar energy to split these compounds into syngas. Syngas, a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, can then be processed into kerosene and methanol. This solar-powered transformation is revolutionary in its ability to create carbon-neutral fuels, as the CO2 emitted during combustion is offset by the CO2 absorbed during production.

Professor Aldo Steinfeld, who leads the research at ETH Zurich, emphasizes the dual impact of this technology: reducing greenhouse gas emissions from aviation and utilizing desert areas for fuel production. Unlike biofuels, which often compete with food crops for arable land, solar fuels can be generated in sun-rich desert regions, preserving valuable agricultural land. This strategic advantage not only enhances environmental sustainability but also aligns with global efforts to transition to renewable energy sources.

The Economic and Environmental Challenges

Despite its promising potential, the large-scale production of solar fuels faces significant economic and logistical challenges. Initial investments for establishing industrial-scale plants are substantial, and the current cost of solar kerosene ranges between $1.35 and $2.20 per liter. To overcome these hurdles, researchers suggest implementing policy measures such as fuel quotas, mandating airlines to source a portion of their fuel from solar-based options. Such regulatory frameworks could facilitate the scale-up of this technology, driving down costs through increased demand and production.

Moreover, the reliance on sunlight as a primary energy source presents geographical constraints. While desert areas offer optimal conditions for production, transporting these fuels to major aviation hubs necessitates a robust infrastructure, further complicating the economic viability. Addressing these challenges will require coordinated global efforts, involving governments, industry stakeholders, and financial institutions to create an ecosystem that supports sustainable aviation fuel development.

Global Implications and Industry Response

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) recognizes the critical role of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) in achieving net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that SAFs could meet 10% of aviation fuel demand by 2030, escalating to nearly 20% by 2040. This transition is vital as global air travel is set to rebound post-pandemic, with passenger numbers expected to reach 7.5 billion by 2035.

Initiatives like the World Economic Forum’s Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition are pivotal in accelerating the deployment of SAFs. Comprising over 60 stakeholders, this coalition aims to power the aviation industry with 10% sustainable fuels by 2030. Through collaborative efforts, the coalition seeks to create a demand aggregation mechanism, co-investment vehicles, and industry-specific blueprints to facilitate the adoption of carbon-neutral flying.

Future Prospects for Carbon-Neutral Aviation

As the aviation sector strives to reduce its carbon footprint, the shift from fossil fuels to sustainable alternatives is paramount. Current SAF usage accounts for less than 0.1% of total aviation fuel consumption, highlighting the need for increased production and investment. The Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition is spearheading initiatives to advance the commercial scale of low-carbon aviation fuels, aiming for widespread industry adoption by 2030.

The transition to carbon-neutral aviation is not without its obstacles. It demands commitment, innovation, and cross-industry collaboration among government leaders, climate experts, and industry CEOs. The success of this endeavor will hinge on the willingness of stakeholders to invest in and support sustainable fuel technologies, ultimately reshaping the future of air travel.

The breakthrough in producing jet fuel from sunlight and air marks a significant milestone in the quest for sustainable aviation. While challenges remain, the potential environmental benefits and alignment with global climate goals underscore the importance of continued research and investment in this field. As the world seeks viable solutions to combat climate change, can the aviation industry rise to the challenge and lead the charge toward a carbon-neutral future?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Key Growth Drivers

There is growing pressure on the aviation industry to reduce its carbon footprint as demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) solutions increases. For instance, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) states that the aviation sector aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. To achieve this goal, new technologies and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), which are expected to reduce emissions by 80%, will be required. Additionally, air routes are being optimized, airport congestion is being decreased, and environmental impacts are being managed through noise and waste reduction.

As environmental awareness increases globally, eco-friendly alternatives to traditional jet fuels are gaining popularity among passengers and airlines. SAFs, which are derived from renewable resources like biomass, waste oils, and agricultural residues, significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions when compared to conventional fossil fuels. Airlines are driving this demand to meet corporate sustainability goals, improve environmental ratings, and comply with international carbon-reduction commitments, like those set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The increasing demand for SAF is expected to increase production capacity, and investment in green aviation technologies.

Major Challenges in Sustainable Aviation Fuel Industry

As SAF is still two to three times more expensive than regular jet fuel, operating an airline is more costly. Global output in 2025 will only cover about 0.7% of demand due to limited manufacturing capacity. Due to strict blending regulations like ReFuelEU, it will be difficult to get enough of the product. These factors increase the cost of tickets and prevent their widespread use.

In addition, regulations that are unclear or subject to change, such as China's postponing mandates, and the US's modifications to its ethanol credit models, are the source of market volatility. Additionally, the absence of production and blending infrastructure, such as refineries, storage facilities, and distribution networks, hinders growth and reduces the likelihood of investment from the public and private sectors.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Segmental Analysis

The global sustainable aviation fuel market is segmented into fuel type, biofuel conversion pathway, biofuel blending capacity, aircraft type, end user, and region.

By fuel type, the biofuel category is the most widely used type of SAF in 2024 due to their compatibility with current airport fueling systems and aircraft engines. Commercial use of biofuels, which are made from spent oils and fats, is already permitted. They are therefore a good option for reducing aviation's carbon footprint soon.

By biofuel conversion pathway, in 2024, the most common SAF conversion mechanism remained the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA-SPK) conversion pathway. A globally approved and commercially viable fuel, HEFA-SPK is derived from renewable lipids such as recycled cooking oil. With lower lifetime emissions and minimal infrastructure requirements, it is a dependable drop-in fuel choice for airlines.

By biofuel blending capacity, in 2024, the sector with blending capacities below 30% is the most popular due to current technological and legal limitations. Within this range, the majority of commercial airlines use a blend of SAF and ordinary jet fuel. Without having to replace the engines or install new fueling systems, this keeps the aircraft operating efficiently and helps them meet their sustainability goals.

By aircraft type, since major airlines like United and Lufthansa started using SAF on their regular flights, commercial aircraft used it the most in 2024. The rapid adoption of SAF in the aviation fuel industry can be attributed in large part to this market. This is a result of the desire for more environmentally friendly travel held by both the public and the government.

By end user, airliner segment accounted for the majority of demand in 2024, they are the primary end users of SAF. As more people want to travel in an environmentally friendly manner, airlines are incorporating SAF into their fuel mix to reduce emissions, comply with regulations like CORSIA and ReFuelEU, and enhance their brand value.

Regional Outlook

North America dominated the sustainable aviation fuel market by 2024, due to US initiatives like the SAF Grand Challenge and resolute pledges from United and Delta Airlines. Airlines and fuel producers can collaborate more easily and increase their output due to federal regulations and incentives, such as tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.

SAF programs are expanding quickly throughout Asia-Pacific, particularly in Singapore and Japan. SAF is now being used on commercial flights operated by ANA and Japan Airlines. The largest SAF manufacturing facility in the world is in Singapore's Neste factory. In addition to meeting aggressive decarbonization targets for aviation hubs in 2025, it improved the local supply.

Europe holds a significant share of the market due to its strict climate change regulations. The ReFuelEU program calls for a higher SAF composition beginning in 2025. Governments are supporting manufacturing initiatives with funding and partnerships to meet strict emissions reduction targets. Airline companies such as Lufthansa and Air France-KLM are also investing in SAF.

The usage of SAF is on the rise in LAMEA and the two leaders in adoption currently are Brazil and the United Arab Emirates, and Etihad and Emirates have both been testing it on long-haul flights recently. Brazil is using its understanding of biofuels to investigate domestic SAF production, however, in too many locations it becomes difficult for others to pursue it due to infrastructure and regulatory challenges.

He noted that both the NEL and Sengkang-Punggol LRT were relying on one shared substation, with the NEL depot substation down.
In a Facebook post, LTA said about 350 staff from LTA and SBS Transit, on top of regular station staff, were deployed to the affected stations to guide commuters.","SINGAPORE – The three-hour

disruption

of train services on the North East Line (NEL)

on Aug 12 was caused by a failure of the power switchboard at the NEL depot’s substation.

Preliminary investigations found that the failure caused a flashover – an unintended electrical discharge – in one of the voltage transformers used to regulate the power supply, said SBS Transit group chief executive Jeffrey Sim in a statement on Aug 12.

This led to a power trip in both the main and backup power supplies as part of the power protection mechanism, he added.

A voltage transformer reduces a high voltage to a lower, safer level, while a power switchboard distributes power from electric sources to several smaller circuits.

The trip at 11am crippled services on the NEL along an 11-station stretch between Farrer Park and Punggol Coast, as well as the entire Sengkang-Punggol LRT.

Mr Sim said engineers from SBS Transit and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) will be working to restore power to the affected substation at the NEL depot in Sengkang after the end of rail service.

The Sengkang and Punggol LRT services were operating on a single track each on the evening of Aug 12, until services were fully reinstated at 9.20pm, said SBS Transit in a Facebook post.

Mr Sim said the faulty voltage transformer at the NEL depot substation could not be repaired immediately after the power trip, so SBS Transit decided to draw power from its other substation at Dhoby Ghaut.

Engineers carried out extensive checks to ensure that the fault would not affect operational stations on the NEL, he added.

Train services then progressively restarted at affected stations as power was restored, before fully resuming across all NEL stations from 2.10pm.

As for the LRT system, Mr Sim said recovery works had to be carried out in stages to ensure a steady increase in electrical load, and prevent another power trip.

He noted that both the NEL and Sengkang-Punggol LRT were relying on one shared substation, with the NEL depot substation down.

A complete restart of the signalling and power systems, followed by checks of those and the LRT trains, had to be carried out to ensure safety, Mr Sim said.

Service on the Sengkang LRT resumed at 3.34pm, while trains started plying the Punggol LRT again at 4.04pm.

Mr Sim said SBS Transit decided to run Sengkang-Punggol LRT services on a single track from both the eastern and western loops during the evening peak period to avoid stressing the power supply from the single substation.

He apologised to affected commuters, and said the operator will work closely with LTA to prevent a repeat of the incident.

In a Facebook post, LTA said about 350 staff from LTA and SBS Transit, on top of regular station staff, were deployed to the affected stations to guide commuters. It added that the NEL has been running an average of 4 million train-km between delays of more than five minutes.

“LTA will investigate the cause of the power fault and SBS Transit’s recovery efforts,” the authority said.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/9b46e4715be84fdc5f97ccb916d9874a3ac2356176f701d1cba92e61e68ba459,N,,2025-08-12 12:56:49.829774

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Key Growth Drivers

There is growing pressure on the aviation industry to reduce its carbon footprint as demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) solutions increases. For instance, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) states that the aviation sector aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. To achieve this goal, new technologies and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), which are expected to reduce emissions by 80%, will be required. Additionally, air routes are being optimized, airport congestion is being decreased, and environmental impacts are being managed through noise and waste reduction.

As environmental awareness increases globally, eco-friendly alternatives to traditional jet fuels are gaining popularity among passengers and airlines. SAFs, which are derived from renewable resources like biomass, waste oils, and agricultural residues, significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions when compared to conventional fossil fuels. Airlines are driving this demand to meet corporate sustainability goals, improve environmental ratings, and comply with international carbon-reduction commitments, like those set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The increasing demand for SAF is expected to increase production capacity, and investment in green aviation technologies.

Major Challenges in Sustainable Aviation Fuel Industry

As SAF is still two to three times more expensive than regular jet fuel, operating an airline is more costly. Global output in 2025 will only cover about 0.7% of demand due to limited manufacturing capacity. Due to strict blending regulations like ReFuelEU, it will be difficult to get enough of the product. These factors increase the cost of tickets and prevent their widespread use.

In addition, regulations that are unclear or subject to change, such as China's postponing mandates, and the US's modifications to its ethanol credit models, are the source of market volatility. Additionally, the absence of production and blending infrastructure, such as refineries, storage facilities, and distribution networks, hinders growth and reduces the likelihood of investment from the public and private sectors.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Segmental Analysis

The global sustainable aviation fuel market is segmented into fuel type, biofuel conversion pathway, biofuel blending capacity, aircraft type, end user, and region.

By fuel type, the biofuel category is the most widely used type of SAF in 2024 due to their compatibility with current airport fueling systems and aircraft engines. Commercial use of biofuels, which are made from spent oils and fats, is already permitted. They are therefore a good option for reducing aviation's carbon footprint soon.

By biofuel conversion pathway, in 2024, the most common SAF conversion mechanism remained the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA-SPK) conversion pathway. A globally approved and commercially viable fuel, HEFA-SPK is derived from renewable lipids such as recycled cooking oil. With lower lifetime emissions and minimal infrastructure requirements, it is a dependable drop-in fuel choice for airlines.

By biofuel blending capacity, in 2024, the sector with blending capacities below 30% is the most popular due to current technological and legal limitations. Within this range, the majority of commercial airlines use a blend of SAF and ordinary jet fuel. Without having to replace the engines or install new fueling systems, this keeps the aircraft operating efficiently and helps them meet their sustainability goals.

By aircraft type, since major airlines like United and Lufthansa started using SAF on their regular flights, commercial aircraft used it the most in 2024. The rapid adoption of SAF in the aviation fuel industry can be attributed in large part to this market. This is a result of the desire for more environmentally friendly travel held by both the public and the government.

By end user, airliner segment accounted for the majority of demand in 2024, they are the primary end users of SAF. As more people want to travel in an environmentally friendly manner, airlines are incorporating SAF into their fuel mix to reduce emissions, comply with regulations like CORSIA and ReFuelEU, and enhance their brand value.

Regional Outlook

North America dominated the sustainable aviation fuel market by 2024, due to US initiatives like the SAF Grand Challenge and resolute pledges from United and Delta Airlines. Airlines and fuel producers can collaborate more easily and increase their output due to federal regulations and incentives, such as tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.

The usage of SAF is on the rise in LAMEA and the two leaders in adoption currently are Brazil and the United Arab Emirates, and Etihad and Emirates have both been testing it on long-haul flights recently. Brazil is using its understanding of biofuels to investigate domestic SAF production, however, in too many locations it becomes difficult for others to pursue it due to infrastructure and regulatory challenges.

Author: Emily Skor CEO of Growth Energy","It has been twenty years since Congress passed the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS)—a bold, bipartisan commitment to strengthen our nation’s energy independence, support rural economies and reduce harmful emissions. For two decades since, the RFS has done exactly what it was designed to do. It has delivered real, measurable benefits to consumers, farmers and the environment. But as we celebrate this milestone, we also need to recognize how to build on our success.

Let’s start with consumers. Every time drivers fill up with fuels like E15, they’re saving money at the pump. The RFS introduced competition into a market previously dominated by fossil fuels. This helped hold down fuel prices for American families, especially during volatile periods for global oil markets. The sum of these savings has kept billions of dollars in Americans’ pockets. It’s a powerful reminder that energy policy can directly improve lives when it puts American innovation and consumers first.

The RFS has also unlocked a wider economic revitalization in rural America. Across the heartland, biorefineries have created tens of thousands of high-quality jobs in engineering, plant operations, research and transportation. These aren’t just numbers on a page. They’re real careers in communities that broader economic shifts have all too often left behind. For rural towns across the Midwest, biofuels are a cornerstone of economic opportunity and growth.

And no one understands the impact of the RFS more deeply than America’s farmers. For generations, farmers have fed our families and fueled our economy. By creating a reliable, high-demand market for corn, soybeans and other feedstocks, the RFS has given farmers a source of stability that is nothing short of essential. This steady demand helps farm families invest in their operations, adopt more sustainable practices and navigate the ups and downs of global commodity markets. The result is a more resilient agricultural sector.

Of course, the RFS is also a cornerstone of U.S. energy security. Two decades ago, we were heavily reliant on foreign oil. Today, thanks in part to the RFS, we’ve dramatically increased our use of domestically produced renewable fuel. Every gallon of ethanol or biodiesel made here in America is one less gallon we need to import. That strengthens our national security and gives us more control over our energy future.

And the environmental impact? According to Growth Energy’s research, the RFS has helped curb over 725 million metric tons of carbon emissions since its inception. That’s the equivalent of taking more than 150 million cars off the road for a year.

For all the progress we’ve made, there’s more work to do. We need strong, stable biofuels blending targets and consistent oversight of refinery exemptions. We need policies that reward innovation, open up new pathways for sustainable aviation fuel and ensure that new technologies like carbon capture are fully recognized under the RFS.

The next chapter of the RFS must be one of momentum. That’s why I’m calling on policymakers on both sides of the aisle to recommit to the promise of the RFS. A promise to America’s farmers, to rural communities, to consumers and to our clean air future. That is a promise worth fighting for.

The company significantly improved gross margins to -31% from -92% last year, aided by service cost reductions, equipment efficiencies, and better hydrogen pricing. CEO Andy Marsh cited “growing scale and cost discipline” as critical drivers toward achieving gross margin neutrality by Q4 2025.

Context

The results mark a turnaround effort under Plug’s “Project Quantum Leap,” which targets cost structure optimization through workforce streamlining, facility consolidation, and renegotiated supply contracts, including a new hydrogen procurement deal set to reduce molecule costs in the second half. Non-cash charges tied to the initiative totaled $80 million in Q2, compared to $6 million a year earlier.

Cash outflows from operations and investments fell more than 40% year-over-year, and Plug ended the quarter with $140 million in unrestricted cash plus over $300 million in accessible debt capacity. The company also expects to monetize U.S. clean energy tax credits under Sections 45V (Clean Hydrogen Production) and 48E (Investment Tax Credit).

Strategic Highlights

Electrolyzer Expansion: Over 230 MW of GenEco electrolyzer projects are underway across Europe, Australia, and North America. In April, Plug’s Georgia plant set a U.S. production record using GenEco systems, underscoring its industrial-scale hydrogen capability.

Market Penetration: GenEco has become a preferred choice for industries from oil refining to steelmaking, with additional large-scale customer commitments expected this year.

Material Handling Growth: Extension of the ITC through 2026 is spurring demand for GenDrive fuel cells, with new bookings expected in H2 2025 to set up growth in 2026.

Energy Transition Diversification: Plug is leveraging liquefier and skid-packaging expertise to enter renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel markets, aiming for new revenue streams later this year.

Policy Tailwinds

· The elimination of the $800 de minimis exception for imported goods, combined with increased tariffs, is expected to send air cargo volumes plummeting for low-value e-commerce shipments.
This will reshape network planning, capacity deployment, and aircraft acquisition strategies as carriers adapt to altered trade routes and cargo volumes.","New trade policies introduced by the United States have ushered in a challenging period for the aviation industry, particularly the air cargo and freight sector.

“The industry was set to build on a record 2024 performance with strong prospects for 2025 and beyond after years of post-COVID rebuilding and growth. It would be unfortunate and counterproductive to destabilize this important industry and its complex ecosystem, and we are hopeful that new international trade agreements can be reached with common-sense exemptions and reduced levies,” according to Cassel Salpeter & Co. “Until tariff uncertainties are resolved, it remains difficult to forecast the future of the industry and supply chains. We are cautiously optimistic that the industry will be able to adapt with new routes and strategies to weather the storm, executing a smooth landing after tariff turbulence.”

Despite the challenging landscape, the air cargo industry is exploring strategies to adapt, while hoping for policy resolution. And, new opportunities may emerge through expansion into additional global markets and premium air cargo pricing, according to datasets released by Cassel Salpeter & Co.

Key takeaways:

· Air freight operators might take proactive measures to mitigate tariff impacts by relocating or onshoring some of their operations and adopting hybrid models that combine direct air fulfillment with pre-stocked forward warehouses in key markets. This approach has the potential to establish new partnerships with countries that can reach negotiated settlements and reduced tariffs, which could diversify existing freight routes and generate additional business for air freight carriers.

· U.S.-based cargo airlines are actively seeking ways to offset higher import costs. Lower fuel prices can provide relief if demand remains stable, while rising jet fuel prices allow airlines to implement fuel surcharges that typically include profits above actual costs.

· Another cost-reduction opportunity involves consolidating air and ocean shipments under single customs entries, potentially reducing customs brokerage and government processing fees per shipment.

· The International Air Transport Association (IATA) downgraded its 2025 guidance for air cargo demand from its 5.8% growth forecast, issued December 2024, to a revised forecast of near-zero growth for the year. This represents a significant reversal for an industry where air cargo volume for passenger and all-cargo airlines grew 12% in 2024, reaching all-time highs.

· Air cargo volumes in the United States through May have declined approximately 25%, year-over-year, per estimates from freight forwarders and customs brokers. The decline has accelerated since May 2, when the de minimis exemption ended for goods from China. Since the Trump administration announced reciprocal tariffs in April, China-U.S. cargo volumes have dropped by up to 60%. Tariffs have severely impacted e-commerce bookings, which fell approximately 50% in May 2025.

· The daily number of trans-Pacific air freighters arriving at the Top 18 U.S. airports has decreased by approximately 30% since April, according to Cirrus Global Advisors. Current forecasts suggest the air cargo market could experience a continued downturn in the second half of the year due to the persistence of new U.S.-imposed tariffs and potential retaliatory measures taken by other countries.

· The impact of new U.S. tariff policy will extend far beyond immediate cost pressures; new trade policy aims to transform international trade and recast global trade routes. As a result, the tariffs have been particularly destabilizing to the airfreight industry, driving price volatility and forcing comprehensive route planning overhauls, particularly within the e-commerce sector.

· The elimination of the $800 de minimis exception for imported goods, combined with increased tariffs, is expected to send air cargo volumes plummeting for low-value e-commerce shipments. With de minimis exemptions unlikely to return, Chinese e-commerce leaders now send products into the United States via bulk sea freight shipments to U.S.-based warehouses and distribution centers, abandoning their use of individual air shipments for direct-to-consumer fulfilment that previously drove cargo aviation growth.

· The air cargo sector faces major headwinds within this evolving tariff environment. Cargo airlines must navigate an increasingly complex landscape of disrupted trade flows as manufacturers and retailers reconfigure supply chains in response to new levies. This will reshape network planning, capacity deployment, and aircraft acquisition strategies as carriers adapt to altered trade routes and cargo volumes.

· The implications of new trade policies are concerning and include declining demand for freighter aircraft and fleet expansion. This may be amplified by a downturn in freighter conversions, driven by rising component costs and procurement delays. Dedicated freighters increasingly dominate global trade volume over passenger aircraft belly cargo; volatility in the freighter market can drive significant systemic impacts.",https://img.sdcexec.com/mindful/acbm/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/08/mariakray-adobestock-178549802.O3GlRYRts2.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-08-12 12:57:43.146773

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is often described as the airline industry’s most immediate tool for cutting emissions, but its adoption remains stubbornly low.

According to industry estimates, SAF accounted for just 0.3% of global jet fuel use in 2024.

To align with net-zero targets, production must grow more than 100-fold by 2050. That scale-up will require billions in investment, coordinated policy support, and a steady pipeline of viable projects; something that, until recently, has proved elusive.

Progress on sustainable aviation fuel from all corners of the world

From South America to South Asia, new facilities and investments are proving that SAF production can happen far beyond its traditional bases in Europe and North America.

In a national first, Indian Oil’s Panipat refinery has been certified to produce SAF from used cooking oil, making it the first facility in the country to do so. Dubbed “from samosa oil to jet fuel” by local media, the project aims to tap into abundant waste feedstocks, turning everyday kitchen waste into a low-carbon alternative to kerosene.

In Argentina, the state-owned oil company YPF has committed $400 million to launch Santa Fe Bio, a joint venture producing SAF from agricultural residues and waste oils. Based at the San Lorenzo refinery, the venture is designed to serve both domestic demand and export markets, positioning Argentina as a regional SAF hub.

On the other side of the world, Pertamina in Indonesia has delivered its first SAF shipment to Soekarno–Hatta Airport, produced at its Cilacap refinery using a blend of waste cooking oil and conventional jet fuel. With a production capacity of 1,400 kilolitres per day, Pertamina plans to supply 1.7 million litres to Jakarta this year, starting with a commercial Jakarta–Bali flight later this month.

Encouraging developments in SAF overshadowed by deep-rooted problems

Despite these encouraging developments, the sector is still struggling to achieve the scale needed. A recent Reuters investigation found that many SAF projects announced in recent years have been stalled, abandoned, or unable to reach a final investment decision.

Notably, United Airlines has quietly discontinued its fuel purchase agreement with Boston-based World Energy. As a result, its Paramount refinery near downtown Los Angeles ceased operations in April. World Energy was one of the first companies in the world to produce commercial quantities of SAF.

The CEO of World Energy, Gene Gebolys, told Reuters some airlines were in the habit of overstating their commitment to SAF projects. “People sometimes said too much in the past and did too little,” he said.

Reuters found that World Energy’s plight mirrors those of dozens of clean energy startups around the world.

Feedstock availability, high production costs, and uncertain long-term policy incentives remain major hurdles. Industry groups warn that without stable regulation and guaranteed offtake agreements, private capital will continue to view SAF as a risky bet.

New projects around the world mark real progress, both technologically and geographically. But the gap between today’s volumes and what’s needed to meet climate targets is still vast.

ESG assurance must become part of the brand marketing playbook

We are well past the point where brands can plead ignorance on misleading green claims.

But too many in the UK are still falling foul of the Advertising Standards Authority, not because they set out to deceive, but because the necessary controls, verification and oversight are often not in place early enough.

Against a strengthening regulatory environment, this is no longer an acceptable situation for the chief marketing officer or chief executive.

Environmental claims are finally starting to be held to the same evidentiary standards as financial ones. With the Competition and Markets Authority now empowered to issue fines of up to 10 per cent of global turnover for unsubstantiated or misleading sustainability claims, without the need for court proceedings, the stakes for non-compliance are no longer theoretical.

A few decades ago, brands might have reasonably argued that verifying complex environmental claims in a timely and structured way was operationally difficult. The regulatory landscape was less developed, and access to reliable data and third-party verification more limited.

But that defence no longer holds. Environmental, social and governance assurance is now a mainstream, well-established process that can be deployed at pace and with confidence.

Given this shift, we wanted to understand how many recent cases of greenwashing could have been avoided if ESG assurance had been applied during advertising campaign development. Menzies reviewed more than 1,000 ASA rulings published between March 2020 and March 2025, identifying 53 that related directly to sustainability or environmental claims.

What brands are still getting wrong

The majority of these ASA rulings reflected four recurring failings:

Unqualified or incomplete claims lacking essential context.

The use of absolutes, such as “zero emissions” or “100 per cent sustainable”, without sufficient evidence.

Failure to consider lifecycle emissions or upstream and downstream impacts.

Ambiguous or undefined language, particularly around terms such as “green” or “eco-friendly”.

These errors are not limited to fringe players or niche sectors. They include major names across aviation, automotive, retail, energy and fast-moving consumer goods. In many cases, the campaigns referenced meaningful progress in sustainability, but poor framing or missing context turned credible advances into compliance failures.

Virgin Atlantic’s “Flight 100” campaign is a case in point. The use of 100 per cent sustainable aviation fuel marked a significant step forward, with a 64 per cent reduction in lifecycle emissions compared with fossil jet fuel. But the phrase “100 per cent sustainable” was ruled misleading, due to lack of qualification and context. What could have been a showcase for progress became a reputational risk.

This and other examples reinforce a broader point: sustainable innovation must now be matched by sustainable communication.

Where ESG assurance makes the difference

Of the green claim rulings we reviewed, 62 per cent could have been avoided if brands had applied ESG assurance during campaign development. For a further 19 per cent, assurance could have reduced the likelihood of a complaint being upheld.

While ESG assurance is well understood in policy and reporting contexts, its role in brand and marketing governance is, for many major brands, clearly absent. Done well, it can test data, clarify language, flag omissions and ensure alignment with international standards.

Just as importantly, it shifts the focus from reactive to proactive. Rather than rushing to defend a claim post-publication, assurance allows brands to launch with confidence, knowing their statements have been independently validated.

A better story, better told

There is a perception that assurance slows campaign development or limits creativity. It often does the opposite. By sharpening the evidence base and tightening language, it enables stronger, more credible storytelling, and allows teams to be bold without being reckless.

Assurance also acts as a forcing function internally. It encourages early co-ordination between ESG, legal, marketing and leadership. It sets a higher bar for internal sign-off and helps elevate ESG from a compliance exercise to a core pillar of brand strategy.

With greenwashing risks rising on the agendas of investors, regulators and consumers, the value of independent validation could not be clearer.

The essential mindset shift

The rules have changed. Sustainability claims are no longer judged on intent, they are judged on evidence and clarity. This responsibility does not sit solely with the CMO.

Advertising and branding agencies also have a role in protecting their clients and their own reputations. Rather than accepting sustainability claims at face value, they should be asking, “show me the evidence” and advocating for ESG assurance when it is missing.

The choice today is no longer whether to adopt ESG assurance, but when. Waiting until after a complaint, investigation or fine is no longer a viable business or career growth strategy.

Those brands that embed assurance early will not only reduce the risk of regulatory fallout, but they will also gain the confidence to craft campaigns that are more creative, more credible and more impactful in the eyes of the public.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/94fc892c-4a59-4bb5-b336-2ee0a015ec83.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 06:56:25.577694

Made up of a coalition of leading ANSPs, the initiative centres around the development of the GAIN tool, the first globally collaborative data and analytics application designed specifically for ANSPs to measure airspace efficiency in a standardised way.

GAIN is designed to enable ANSPs around the world to benchmark performance, share insights, and drive more sustainable airspace management. In Europe alone, routing inefficiencies are thought to cause roughly 5-11% additional fuel burn per flight, translating to tens of millions of tonnes of CO₂ annually. By leveraging cutting-edge analytics and complex algorithms, GAIN equips ANSPs with the tools to identify airspace hotspots, set actionable targets, and benchmark performance.

NATS, alongside CAAM, skeyes, and AZANS, officially launched GAIN as a not-for-profit initiative in May this year, and with ATNS now joining the collaboration, over 10% of the world’s air traffic falls under the jurisdiction of the Founding Members. Together they have the potential to achieve annual savings of at least 450,000 tonnes of CO2 through airspace and aircraft routing improvements.

On joining GAIN, the acting CEO of ATNS,Matome Moholola said: “I believe that collaborative programs such as the GAIN initiative will assist the industry in understanding their contribution and defining measures in improving operational efficiency and reducing aircraft emissions to meet the global target of Net-Zero by 2050”.",https://www.timesaerospace.aero/sites/aerospace/times/files/ta-favico.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 06:56:30.973040

The biofuels market is evolving rapidly, with new technologies and policies shaping the future of sustainable fuels. How do you see GIDARA’s role in this changing landscape?

The biofuels sector is at a crossroads: demand for sustainable fuels is surging, but the industry is running up against hard limits – particularly with feedstock availability. At GIDARA, we are addressing this head-on by turning an abundant challenge – waste – into a powerful solution for the energy transition.

Our HTWR gasification technology enables the conversion of a wide range of waste streams into sustainable fuels and chemicals, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and methanol. What sets us apart is our gasification pathway, which is emerging as one of the most important solutions to the industry’s feedstock bottleneck.

By licensing our technology, we empower global partners to tap into new, locally available feedstock streams and accelerate the rollout of fuels and chemicals where they’re needed most. Our focus extends beyond growing our business; it’s about significantly increasing our impact and helping the energy transition overcome its current limitations.

The aviation sector is under intense pressure to decarbonise, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is seen as a key solution. What are the main obstacles to scaling SAF, and how is GIDARA working with others to overcome them?

Aviation’s decarbonisation challenge is urgent. While SAF is widely recognised as the most viable near-term solution, the sector remains stuck at less than 1% SAF penetration. The HEFA route alone will not be enough to meet future demand, as it is constrained by limited supplies of waste fats, oils and greases.

This is where GIDARA’s gasification pathway makes a real difference – it opens the door to a much broader and more abundant feedstock base, allowing for true scaleup of SAF production. Our HTWR technology has been proven at industrial scale, and we believe it is key to delivering the SAF capacity the industry needs.

However, technology alone is not enough to move the needle. That’s why we’ve joined forces with Johnson Matthey, Honeywell UOP and Samsung E&A. Together, we combine expertise in catalyst development, automation, engineering and project delivery.

What makes this SAF Technology Alliance unique is that, for the first time, all the critical elements for commercial-scale SAF production have been brought together. Cutting-edge technology, world class engineering and proven project execution are now unified under one coordinated partnership.

This alliance enables us to reduce project lead times by more than 15% and lower investment risk for our customers. Our coordinated approach provides customers with a single, integrated solution that meets the market’s demand for speed, certainty and tangible progress.

Looking ahead, what gives you confidence that advanced biofuels and alliances like yours can deliver on the promise of a lower carbon future?

What gives me real confidence is the unique capability of gasification to unlock a future for sustainable fuels that simply isn’t possible with other technologies. Gasification stands out because it can transform a vast array of low-value waste materials – otherwise destined for landfill – into high-quality syngas, which is then converted into sustainable fuels and chemicals. This approach isn’t just about volume – it’s about flexibility and resilience. Unlike other pathways that are limited by scarce feedstocks, gasification opens access to a much broader spectrum, from municipal solid waste to biomass, making true scale-up achievable.

At GIDARA, we’ve refined this pathway using our HTWR gasification technology, which is proven at commercial scale, robust, and highly adaptable. Our process is engineered for efficiency, reliability and operational simplicity, making it deployable at industrial scale and easily integrated into existing infrastructure.

This is a gamechanger for decarbonisation: it enables the production of fuels that meet stringent standards while reducing waste and emissions at the source. Another positive sign is the momentum we’re seeing across the board: policymakers are raising the bar with new mandates – such as ReFuelEU and the IMO; investors are backing scalable solutions; and the industry is embracing new technologies that can finally help us overcome the current limitations of the energy transition.

At GIDARA, our role is to enable and connect – to provide our technology, experience and partnerships that turn ambition into action. By focusing on practical, scalable solutions and working as part of a powerful alliance, we’re helping to build the infrastructure for a truly circular and low-carbon economy.
