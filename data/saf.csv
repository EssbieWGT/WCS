But at the 2025 IATA World Cargo Symposium (WCS) in Dubai, it became clear that sustainability isn't just about what's in the fuel tank — it's also about what ends up in the trash.

In a panel on circular economy in air cargo, industry leaders peeled back the layers on one of the sector’s most under-discussed opportunities: reimagining waste not as a by-product, but as a resource. Moderated by Saleem Saeed, Sustainability Manager at IAG Cargo, the conversation featured Michelle Fok, Head of Sustainable Development at Cathay Cargo Terminal; Celine Hourcade, Vice President, Global Head of ESG / Sustainability at SATS; and Daniel Leng, Chief Operating Officer at LATAM Cargo; each offering deeply grounded insights into how their organisations are attempting to close the loop on materials, processes, and procurement.

“Sustainability isn’t always a cost centre. In many of our projects, it helped us save money, simplify operations, and reduce waste.”

Daniel Leng, LATAM Cargo

Their collective message? The path to circularity in air cargo is complex, but the potential payoff — for the planet and the bottom line — is immense.

Beyond carbon: Why circularity is the next sustainability frontier

Net-zero by 2050 is now a baseline expectation in aviation. But the panellists of the sustainability track at IATA WCS Dubai argued that meeting this goal requires more than cleaner fuels. It calls for an industry-wide pivot away from the traditional “take-make-dispose” approach and toward systems where materials are reused, repurposed and retained in the value chain for as long as possible.

As SATS’s Hourcade pointed out, it’s a shift that starts not with fuel but with a fundamental mindset change: “Transformation requires that mindset shift,” she said. “You have to start with your local teams, test what works in your own context, and once you understand the impact, you can expand and apply those learnings to operations across the network.”

Circularity isn’t a parallel track to sustainability — it’s the infrastructure that underpins it.

From siloed operations to shared intelligence

One of the most powerful takeaways from the discussion was the recognition that most air cargo terminals operate in isolation. Cathay Cargo Terminal’s Fok acknowledged that, despite belonging to a major airline group, her team at Cathay Cargo Terminal had limited visibility into the innovations or challenges faced by others.

“We don’t really have a very big network of talking to each other,” she admitted. “If we’re limiting ourselves to just our own operations and local knowledge, it means we’re also limiting our ability to learn from some of the good practices happening elsewhere — whether that’s in the UK, the US, or even in Chile,” mentioned Fok.

This lack of communication is more than an operational inconvenience — it’s a lost opportunity. In a sector defined by global connectivity, the internal fragmentation is stark. If the industry can move containers across oceans in 24 hours, surely it can move knowledge across departments.

Procurement as strategy, not paperwork

The panel also pulled back the curtain on one of the most overlooked levers of sustainability: procurement. In many organisations, procurement is treated as a compliance function — focused on cost, volume, and delivery. But in a circular model, procurement becomes a strategic driver of change.

LATAM Cargo’s Leng didn’t mince words: “If you say, ‘Okay, I’m just going to decide based on price,’ then you’re not being true to what you’re claiming as a sustainability-led company.”

What does this mean in practice? It means choosing materials not only for their performance or cost but also based on recyclability, reusability, and environmental origin. It means embedding sustainability into contracts, so vendors are held to the same values as the buyer. And it means pushing beyond superficial certifications to demand operational transparency.

“If we’re limiting ourselves to just our own operations and local knowledge, it means we’re also limiting our ability to learn from some of the good practices happening elsewhere.”

Michelle Fok, Cathay Cargo Terminal

“We’re not quite there yet,” Leng admitted, “but if you don’t involve your suppliers from the beginning — if you’re not clear about your sustainability expectations — it’s going to be very difficult to make any progress.”

The innovation culture gap

Perhaps the most compelling part of the conversation revolved around the cultural barriers to circularity. Shifting mindsets inside large organisations is no small feat. Sustainability, in many firms, is still siloed — treated as a marketing function or relegated to an annual report, mentioned Leng in an exclusive interview on the side lines of IATA WCS.

But as Fok explained, her team used the IATA Environmental Assessment (IEnvA) certification process as a Trojan horse to re-examine their entire operational model through the lens of sustainability. “It challenged me to look into the whole process again together with our stakeholders,” she said. “I alone cannot do anything; it has to be collaborative.”

Leng echoed that sentiment with a powerful reminder of where real innovation comes from: “All of our sustainability initiatives — every single one of them — came from our frontline teams. That’s where innovation lives. All they needed was support and room to explore.”

He continued, “Sustainability isn’t always a cost centre. In many of our projects, it helped us save money, simplify operations, and reduce waste. You just have to give your people the space to innovate.”

Regulatory disarray: The enemy of progress

Circularity may be a global ideal, but regulations are deeply local. For multinationals like SATS and LATAM, this fragmentation poses a significant challenge.

“We operate in 27 countries,” Hourcade noted. “We have to face different jurisdictions, different regulations, and they are not consistent with one another.”

Leng shared a similar frustration: “Some companies can do it in one country but not in another, simply because local regulation doesn’t allow you to take that step. That lack of consistency makes it harder to implement good practices at scale.”

“But if we can align incentives, if we can be transparent, and if we can share learnings, then we have a fighting chance (towards achieving sustainability)”

Saleem Saeed, IAG Cargo

This inconsistency isn’t just frustrating — it’s a strategic risk. It creates inefficiencies, undermines ROI, and disincentivises innovation. That’s why all three panellists agreed: industry bodies like IATA must take the lead in establishing common guidelines and global standards.

The missing piece: Standardisation across the chain

Circularity isn't just about reusing materials — it’s about designing systems that make reuse possible. That requires standardisation. But as Hourcade pointed out, this is easier said than done when each airline specifies different materials and packaging preferences.

“If each airline has its own type of plastics, or a different type of cover they want us to use, then we lose control over our own sustainability strategy,” she said. “It creates fragmentation that ultimately works against the circularity ambition we all share.”

The problem isn’t just material choice. It’s also about volume. Without scale, circular solutions — like reusable cargo wraps or cardboard pallets — struggle to achieve economic viability. In other words: innovation needs alignment to survive.

Labs, loops, and learning from failure

So where does that alignment begin? According to Leng, it starts with creating experimental hubs. LATAM uses its operations in Santiago and Miami as “labs” to test circular solutions like reusable pallets, biodegradable straps and new loading procedures.

“In Miami, for example, we’ve replaced single-use plastic wraps for flower imports with reusable blankets. It keeps the flowers dry during rain, performs better than plastic, and is reused endlessly. It’s simple, effective, and cleaner.”

He also pointed to LATAM’s Second Flight initiative: “We collect old uniforms from our crew and give them to local artisans to create purses, wallets, and other goods. Instead of ending up in landfills, they get a second life — and empower local communities.”

Even cargo pallets haven’t been spared the circular rethink. “We now inspect the wooden pallets brought in by customers. If they’re operational, we reuse them. If damaged, we repair them. If beyond repair, we recycle them. This helped us cut pallet purchases for exports by 100% and for imports by 50%.”

And in Santiago, LATAM's use of bright red plastic pallets — made from recycled soda crates — has not only helped reduce waste but also loss: “Since we’re the only ones using red, we no longer lose them. It’s a small but smart win for operations and the planet.”

But testing also means failing — and that’s something the industry needs to get comfortable with. “You need to develop that safe environment for creativity,” said Saeed. “It’s that continuous improvement bit. You try something. If it doesn’t work, you try again.”

Fok agreed: “We need to keep failing, we need to keep innovating, keep learning from the journey, and keep improving.”

Airlines as enablers, not observers

Another recurring theme was the pivotal role airlines play — not just as clients, but as co-innovators. “Airline is actually a very important stakeholder inside the circularity journey,” Fok said.

When airlines back a circular initiative — whether it’s a new type of pallet or a reusable cargo wrap — they give it scale, credibility and operational runway. In many cases, projects that would otherwise stall in pilot mode can go global with the right airline support.

“If each airline has its own type of plastics, or a different type of cover they want us to use, then we lose control over our own sustainability strategy.”

Celine Hourcade, SATS

Leng reinforced this with a broader strategic vision: “As a group, we’ve committed to a sustainability strategy centred on climate change, shared value, and circular economy. We’re not just flying sustainably — we’re redesigning our culture around it.”

Final descent: Rethinking waste as strategy

The transition to a circular economy in air cargo isn’t a quick fix or a corporate buzzword. It’s a paradigm shift. It requires letting go of linear thinking and reimagining waste as a strategic asset — not an unavoidable cost.

The panelists at WCS 2025 offered a refreshingly grounded take on what it will take to get there. Collaboration. Cultural transformation. Standardisation. Transparency in procurement. And above all, a willingness to fail, learn, and adapt.

“There’s no silver bullet,” Saeed concluded. “But if we can align incentives, if we can be transparent, and if we can share learnings, then we have a fighting chance.”

The message from Dubai was clear: sustainability in air cargo is no longer just about flying cleaner. It’s about thinking in circles — because that’s the only way forward.",https://www.stattimes.com/h-upload/2025/04/25/81370-iata-sustainability-1.jpg,N,,2025-04-27 02:56:17.001076

Spanning approximately 1,200 acres, the Pudimadaka hub is envisioned as an integrated facility for green chemicals and sustainable manufacturing. Once fully operational, it aims to harness 7 GW of renewable energy and export over 2.5 million tonnes of green chemicals annually.

This partnership brings together Honeywell UOP’s global expertise in sustainable aviation fuel production and NTPC’s leadership in green hydrogen development. It also aligns with NTPC’s broader goal of achieving a 60 GW renewable energy capacity by 2032.

The Green Hydrogen Hub is expected to attract an estimated investment of ₹1.85 lakh crore in Andhra Pradesh, create substantial employment opportunities, and significantly contribute to India’s national target of 500 GW of non-fossil energy capacity by 2030.",https://indianmasterminds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cropped-favicon-512x512-1-32x32.png,N,,2025-04-26 18:56:24.095594

Leaked Scottish Government documents say Petroineos had “no intention” of supporting any of the proposals that could salvage hundreds of jobs.

The company is also said to have demanded major changes to Nats’ and UK Government energy policies for it to agree to anything.

A briefing from officials to SNP Acting Cabinet Secretary for Net Zero, Gillian Martin, states: “Petroineos have stated previously that the technologies of most interest to the joint venture (sustainable aviation fuel/bio fuels production and green hydrogen) are sub economic.

“Therefore there is no intention on the business’ part to proceed with these options without significant policy changes at UK Government and Scottish Government level.”

The blow emerged before a £1.5million UK and SNP government plan outlining nine potential futures for Scotland’s only oil refinery was published last month.

Project Willow warned that £3.5billion in private cash would be needed to transform the plant near Falkirk — set to shut in this year with 400 jobs axed — into a renewables hub fit for the future.

The stance by Petroineos, a joint venture between China and Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, has emerged amid anger at how British Steel’s Chinese owners ran down its Scunthorpe plant.

Scots Lib Dem economy spokesman Willie Rennie urged the Nats ministers to explore “every viable route” to secure Grangemouth’s future.

He added: “Unfortunately they seem to have wasted five years when they could have been getting ahead of the problem. Petroineos are not covering themselves in glory but workers will have little sympathy for John Swinney and Keir Starmer too.”

Labour has come under fire for not moving to save the refinery in the same way they did to take control of British Steel.

First Minister Mr Swinney said this month Grangemouth should be nationalised by the UK Government.

Petroineos said Nats were warned about Grangemouth’s woes in 2020.

The firm was contacted for comment. The Scottish Government said: “Refining at Grangemouth should continue, the closure is premature and is detrimental to Scotland’s transition to net zero.

“We have continued to press the UK Government to leave no stone unturned in securing the site’s future as interventions of this magnitude would require them to take action.”",https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/775-million-losses-last-refinery-935863600_1cfaf7.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-04-26 18:56:29.595306

MANILA, Philippines — The rise in vegetable oil prices in the world market is opening new doors to one of the country’s prized agricultural products: coconut.

Global vegetable oil prices –from palm, sunflower to coconut – have been on a rally as world supplies tighten amid growing demand for both household and industrial uses.

The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) vegetable oil price index in March rose by nearly 24 percent year-on-year to 161.8 points from 130.6 points in the same month last year.

The FAO attributed the increase to the continued spike in the global prices of palm, soy, rapeseed and sunflower oils due to dwindling supplies coupled by rising demand by consumers.

The effects of the hike in world vegetable oil prices were immediately felt in the country through higher copra prices and more expensive cooking oil.

The uptick in copra prices is indeed a welcome news to over three million Filipino coconut farmers, who are considered among the poorest in the country.

But on the other hand, consumers are reeling from higher prices of cooking oil. Industries, such as food and fuel, are also impacted.

But between these two sectors, an opportunity arises for both the sector and the government: to further promote coconut value-adding to advance the development of the sector and improve the welfare of farmers.

It is high time for the coconut industry to accelerate its efforts of utilizing all parts of the mature nut amid the tightening of supplies.

This is one of the recommendations made to Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) administrator and CEO Dexter Buted to address the current coconut supply situation by the agency’s Trade Information and Relations Division (TIRD).

The recommendation noted that coconut water from ordinary copra production must be collected and processed into nata de coco to serve as raw materials for the manufacturing of coco patch and other cellulosic materials.

Likewise, small and medium virgin coconut oil producers must be trained to use their coconut water into beverages and other users, according to the memorandum from the PCA’s TIRD.

Coconut water is one of the rising export products of the country with value of shipments estimated at $67.45 million in 2023, according to industry players.

There is also an opportunity to take advantage of the coconut husks, which often go into waste, to be sold to decorticating machines or coir processing plants to produce value-added products.

Meanwhile, the coconut shell can be turned into charcoal briquettes and even into handicrafts that should be promoted under the government’s Coconut Farmers Industry Development Plant, which is bankrolled by the coconut levy trust fund.

“The increasing global demand trend for vegetable oils is inevitable. This is a big opportunity for the Philippines to further strengthen its flagship industry,” the memorandum read.

The rise in global vegetable oil prices continues to be evident in the country’s export earnings as coconut oil shipments in the first two months continue to outpace last year’s figures at even faster rates.

Coconut oil exports rose by almost seven percent year-on-year to 139,413 metric tons (MT) but its value surged by 80 percent on an annual basis to nearly $250 million, based on Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) data.

In February, the value of coconut oil exports more than doubled to $251.12 million from $118.59 million in the same month last year, PSA data also showed.

The country’s total earnings from coconut oil exports last year reached a record-high of almost $2.2 billion, about 85 percent higher than the $1.18 billion recorded in 2023.

The country’s exports of other coconut products like shell charcoal rose by nearly 60 percent year-on-year to $76.3 million from $47.8 million. Likewise, export volume of the coconut product expanded by nearly 65 percent to 140,280 MT from 85,103 MT.

The country can also take advantage of growing demand from transport and aviation industries by boosting production of vegetable oil-based products such as coconut methyl ester (for biodiesel) and sustainable aviation fuel.

This measure complements the policy that is being mulled over by the government wherein a portion of the country’s coconut oil will be retained for domestic use to ensure supply and prevent further price spikes while shipping out excess stocks to sustain the prized export market.

Penetrating the higher value markets such as biofuels and sustainable aviation fuels would be able to replace the lost export revenues caused by the retention policy.

The PCA is in talks with industry stakeholders and relevant government agencies regarding the proposal.

The PCA has the legal mandate and basis to regulate the export of coconut oil, as provided under multiple presidential decrees including PD 1468 that created the agency’s charter and mandate.

The power was further strengthened under PD 1644 as it granted the PCA the “full power and authority” to regulate the marketing and export of copra, coconut oil and their by-products.

Neighboring countries such as Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia have already implemented various export restriction policies to address supply shortages and rising cooking oil prices in their respective markets.

Despite an increase in production, the country’s coconut oil exports are projected to remain flat in market year 2025-2026 (October-September) at 1.13 million MT due to higher demand for biodiesel blending, according to a US report.",https://media.philstar.com/photos/2025/04/26/4_2025-04-26_19-25-37.jpg,N,,2025-04-26 21:57:04.996318

Baseball, America’s favourite pastime, is known for its exciting moments, but it’s also a sport with a significant environmental impact. As awareness of climate change grows, sustainability in sports is becoming more important, and baseball is making strides to reduce its carbon footprint and become more eco-friendly.

One major change is the way baseball stadiums are being designed and renovated. Many MLB teams now use eco-friendly building materials, energy-efficient systems, and waste reduction strategies.

For example, Citi Field, home of the New York Mets, has installed low-flow toilets and energy-saving lights. In fact, 15 MLB teams have committed to achieving zero waste in their stadiums, and teams like the San Francisco Giants are leading the way. These efforts have helped MLB reduce energy consumption by 40% in the last decade. A significant step for sustainability in sports.

Sustainable Equipment

Baseball equipment is also becoming more sustainable. Traditionally, bats were made from wood, and gloves were made from leather, both of which are natural resources. Now, manufacturers are looking for eco-friendly alternatives, like synthetic, plant-based materials for gloves and bats made from sustainable wood or recycled materials. This reduces the need for new timber and leather.

Another big focus for baseball is reducing the sport’s carbon footprint. Travel is a key contributor to emissions, as teams often fly across the country. Some teams are now investing in carbon offset programs to balance out their emissions, and MLB has set a goal to become carbon neutral by 2050.

Sustainable Food and Concessions

Food and concessions at games also play a role in sustainability. The food industry in stadiums produces a lot of waste, from plastic to food scraps. Many teams are working to cut down on this waste by eliminating single-use plastics, offering plant-based options, and composting more food waste. The Seattle Mariners, for example, have eliminated plastic straws, and other stadiums are following by switching to more recyclable and biodegradable materials.

Fan Participation in Sustainability

Fans are also part of the solution. As people become more environmentally conscious, fans are encouraged to recycle, carpool, and bring reusable bottles to games. These small actions may seem minor, but they add up when you consider the millions of people attending games each season.

A Growing Movement

While baseball’s journey to sustainability is still just beginning, the changes are noticeable and will likely keep growing. The sport is setting a great example for other industries, proving that even something as traditional as baseball can evolve to protect the planet. From energy-efficient stadiums to sustainable food options, baseball is showing that it’s not just a game for fans but a game for the Earth too.

Conclusion

In conclusion, baseball is hitting home runs in sustainability. By reducing waste, using eco-friendly materials, and promoting environmental responsibility, the sport is helping create a greener world one game at a time.",https://brignews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/pexels-pixabay-264279-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-04-26 18:56:42.309636

Without action by Congress and the Trump Administration, America risks falling behind our global competitors, led by China, in producing a critically important source of our energy independence: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

SAF was invented in the U.S. by American innovators in our private sector. They have developed novel ways to convert crops, plants, biomass, captured gases, waste and even used cooking oil into jet fuel. SAF is blended with jet fuel without the need to modify existing aircraft. SAF also creates good-paying jobs and new economic opportunities for farmers and communities in rural America. With farmers worried about tariffs impacting their sales abroad, the Trump Administration can act today to encourage more U.S. crops are converted into SAF that are produced here in America.

Right now, countries like China and Brazil are incentivizing their farmers, boosting SAF production and imported SAF into the U.S. at the expense of our domestic energy producers. As a result, American aviation relies heavily on SAF that’s produced outside of the US.

American farmers are going to feel some pain of the Trump trade measures, because foreign nations are already working to block exported farm products from the United States. Politico reported on April 3, 2025, “Trump administration officials are assuring farm-state Republicans they will funnel billions of taxpayer dollars to farmers who are hit by President Donald Trump’s intensifying trade war.” Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins met with Sens. John Boozman (R-AR) and John Hoeven (R-ND) to discuss how to add some funding of farm bill programs to the upcoming budget reconciliation measure to help hurting farmers.

SAF creates new markets for American agriculture, bioenergy, and technology developers. Incentivizing more SAF production in the U.S. will create new opportunities for American agriculture and will help mitigate the impact of trade actions by our global competitors.

The alternative fuels produced by farmers for aviation is widely used by commercial aircraft today and could be wholly sourced in the United States with the right policy. Sustainable fuels, SAFs, as described by the U.S. Department of Energy are “an alternative fuel made from non-petroleum feedstocks” that can “be blended at different levels with limits between 10% and 50%, depending on the feedstock and how the fuel is produced.” They cite the International Civil Aviation Organization for the fact that over 360,000 commercial flights have used SAF in the U.S. and Europe.

Although SAFs have some positive environmental impact, it is important to note the economic aspect of insourcing production. Insourcing while helping farmers who will be hurt by their products being cut off from export to China because of the tariff battle going on between the U.S. and China is good policy. The market domestically is vast for these fuels because an American aircraft can use up to 50% SAF that ends up blending with traditional fossil fuels with that percentage increasing every year.

It makes no economic sense to have the Department of Energy set high targets for SAF, while we import from China and Brazil. The technology exists to convert American crops and plants to fuel. There also is the capability to use biomass and other resources to produce more domestically. Federal policy should be to encourage domestic production through subsidies and tax credits, while discouraging companies from importing from other nations farmers.

China and Brazil have been especially focused on dominating the SAF market. Valor International reported on April 23, 2025, “Chinese renewable energy company Envision is considering investments in Brazil to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).” The platform Sustainable Aviation Fuels Futures cited that “Brazil's diverse agricultural landscape offers a variety of feedstocks suitable for SAF production” including sugarcane bagasse and straw, cattle manure, and municipal solid waste.” Brazil and China are large exporters of SAF to the United States.

America is already drilling, mining and fracking our way energy independence. We can do the same by unleashing American agriculture, bioenergy, timber and other industries and encouraging them to grow/create more feedstock to generate more SAF here at home.

This strategic move not only benefits the environment but also secures the U.S.'s position in the global energy race. By driving innovation and ensuring robust supply chains, the U.S. stands poised to effectively counter China's efforts in the SAF domain, securing America as the leader in this competitive future for all. As the skies beckon with the promise of sustainable flights, the role of the U.S. government in fostering SAF development is crucial. It ensures a greener tomorrow, setting the pace for sustainable aviation on a global scale.

Now is the time for our government to support the domestic production of this fuel so American companies don’t have to rely on foreign sourced sustainable fuel.

Ultimately, only 14 Concordes ever flew, but now that supersonic flights may be returning, so are the environmentalists.
Environmentalists had raised concerns about damage to the ozone layer, which died down when it became clear that supersonic flights wouldn't become widespread.
The Challenges Facing The Boom Overtures In the 20th century, a supersonic jet was a technical achievement.
The Rundown Of The Boom Overture Boom has a major challenge ahead of itself.","The Boom Overture is an upcoming supersonic transport. It will carry 60 to 80 passengers traveling at Mach 1.7, with a range of 4,250 NM (7,870 KM). Some speculate about whether the plane will ever fly, and there are certainly reasons to be worried. But if it does and if it becomes successful, then it will undoubtedly be one of the most impressive aircraft projects to ever come out of the commercial aircraft industry, and it's using something that has existed for over a century: brilliant aerospace engineering.

Unfortunately, not everyone is excited about breaking the sound barrier again. Beyond skeptics who criticize the aircraft from a business perspective, environmentalists are pushing back. They believe that a Boom supersonic transport (SST) is a dangerous idea, something that moves in the opposite direction of where we as a society should be headed. The same thing happened back in the 1960s, when Concorde , the Boeing 2707 , and the Tupolev TU-144 were being developed. Ultimately, only 14 Concordes ever flew, but now that supersonic flights may be returning, so are the environmentalists.

Damage To The Environment

In 2018, the European Federation for Transport and Environment published a three-page report regarding the effects of supersonic flight on the climate. The findings were concerning. First, the T&E describes that high-altitude flying would worsen non-CO2 effects. Most airliners cruise at altitudes between 30,000 feet and 43,000 feet, while a future SST like the Boom Overture would fly at 55,000 feet or higher. These can exceed CO2 emissions, and hundreds of SSTs in the skies could contribute significantly more to these harmful emissions than their fleet sizes would suggest.

Not only will the planes emit more, but they will also carry fewer passengers. Boom claims that up to 80 passengers can fit into the Overture, which, at 201 ft (61m), is similar in size to a Boeing 787 Dreamliner or an Airbus A330. These planes can carry 300 or more passengers. A Boeing 757-300, a large single-aisle jet, is 22 ft (6.7 m) shorter and carries 234 passengers in Delta's configuration. So not only will the Overture be more wasteful, but each passenger will contribute significantly more in terms of CO2 emissions and other toxic effects.

Furthermore, with 60-80 seats being sold for business class prices, as Boom claims, the Overture is primarily meant to fly between airports like London Heathrow, New York-JFK, and Tokyo-Haneda. These are huge centers for business travel, but they have slot restrictions. To use the Overture on these city pairs, airlines will need to remove existing equipment from these routes, replacing it with a jet that is more polluting while carrying fewer passengers. Not a leap forward for a world that is hoping to go greener.

Noise Concerns And The Effects

The Concorde, Tupolev Tu-144, F-22 Lightning, and the F-15 Eagle all have something in common. These supersonic planes all produce a sonic boom, an aural effect that occurs when an aircraft breaks the sound barrier. This sound can be heard by everyone under the flight path of a supersonic jet, as it occurs continuously when an aircraft is flying past the speed of sound. A sonic boom typically measures at 110 dB, which is equivalent to holding a chainsaw in your hands, and can even cause damage to buildings.

This has led nearly every country in the world to ban commercial supersonic flights over land, which severely impacted the viability of the Concorde. The return of supersonic flying would either require changes in legislation, new engineering solutions to minimize the effect of the sonic boom, or be relegated to overwater flights. Furthermore, Concorde was also incredibly loud during takeoffs and landings, so any new SST would need to address this as well.

The idea of letting hundreds of supersonic airliners fly above Mach 1 while rattling windows would be incredibly unpopular with voters, so it's unlikely that legislation would change regarding this. Although the T&E does go in-depth about the noise impacts of SST fleets, this is a less realistic concern. Any SST will only be able to fly above Mach 1 over water, unless governments experience a serious change of heart.

Boom's Response To These Concerns

Boom claims that Overture will be 100% compatible with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This is a type of jet fuel that doesn't use fossil fuels in its production, but is rather a biofuel. Using SAF doesn't change the emissions directly generated from aircraft engines, but the carbon emitted from these planes can be absorbed back into the sources that are used for SAF, effectively making it carbon-neutral.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has pledged to make aviation fully carbon-neutral by 2050, and SAF is a key component to that. It's compatible with existing engines, and SAF can even be mixed in with traditional jet fuel. However, production is not widespread yet, and it's significantly more expensive than regular fuel, which means that we still have a long way to go until widespread acceptance. SAF also doesn't address the problem of other emissions damaging the atmosphere at high altitudes.

As for the noise, Boom claims that the Overture will be comparable to today's subsonic airliners when they are close to the ground. During cruise, Boom has another solution. The company recently announced what it dubbed ""Boomless Cruise."" Essentially, below Mach 1.3, the sonic boom will refract upwards, away from the ground. This is made possible by software-controlled speeds and the design of Boom's in-house Symphony engine. However, the plane will generate an audible sonic boom above Mach 1.3, meaning that it can only fly at top speed over water.

How The Flaws Of The Past Are Shaping The Overture

In the 1960s, there were three major SST projects on the drawing board: Europe's Concorde, the Soviet Tupolev TU-144, and the comparatively huge Boeing 2707. The Americans got tied up in engineering challenges, bureaucracy, and cost overruns, so the 2707 didn't make it off the drawing board. The TU-144 had some problems and was pulled out of service seven months after debuting. 14 Concordes flew until 2003, but this doesn't mean that the plane was economical.

Environmentalists had raised concerns about damage to the ozone layer, which died down when it became clear that supersonic flights wouldn't become widespread. Today, the Overture's SAF capabilities should help address environmental concerns. Meanwhile, the ""Boomless Cruise"" will allow the Overture to fly supersonically overland without the sonic boom.

Furthermore, the Concorde burned so much fuel that its 100 seats had to be sold for First Class prices. British Airways made a profit by branding it as an exclusive, unique experience for the ultra-rich, made possible from its London hub and the type's rarity. Meanwhile, Boom claims that the Overture's seats can be sold for business class prices, a much easier price point to sell tickets.

The Challenges Facing The Boom Overtures

In the 20th century, a supersonic jet was a technical achievement. The Americans couldn't even get it done, and the TU-144 was plagued with technical problems. But today, it's been done. The challenge now will be to make it work economically, which is no easy feat. The engines will be the biggest factor in whether the Overture succeeds or not, and this hasn't been a smooth process for Boom.

Boom was unable to find a viable off-the-shelf design or convince a manufacturer to develop a new motor, so instead it's developing the Symphony engine in-house, with help from Kratos, StandardAero, and General Electric subsidiaries. However, designing engines is hard, and there's a reason why neither Airbus nor Boeing designs jet engines themselves. The Symphony is particularly ambitious, and Boom is promising fuel efficiency as well as the Boomless Cruise feature.

Boom will need to create a plane that works as a supersonic transport and as a proper airliner. The environmental concerns are also valid, and Boom will need to ensure that its answers work. If the plane is too polluting, then it's quite possible that it simply won't be certified, given the current state of the environment. Buying an extremely dirty plane will also be bad publicity for airlines.

The Rundown Of The Boom Overture

Boom has a major challenge ahead of itself. It needs to create a plane that is appealing for airlines to operate, while also being a thirsty supersonic jet, and it needs to address the environmental concerns. Otherwise, airlines won't buy it. The environmental concerns are real, and if not addressed, this could be a step backward in the goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions.

The biggest challenge to success will be the Symphony engine. This is an incredibly ambitious goal, and the company has taken on the challenge of developing the motor itself. If it succeeds, this will certainly be an incredible achievement. But it must address economic concerns and environmental concerns to make sense for airlines.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/why-some-environmentalists-aren-t-too-happy-with-the-comeback-of-supersonic-flights-16x9.jpg,N,,2025-04-26 13:56:36.987705

The project is a partnership between refinery owner ExxonMobil and French-based firm Hynamics, a subsidiary of EDF Group.

Hynamics will install a 120MW electrolyser, which splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. All of the hydrogen produced by the plant will be supplied to the refinery ”replacing existing fossil fuels used for heating”, a Hynamics spokesperson said.

The project was shortlisted by the government’s Hydrogen Allocation Round 2 (HAR2), which allocates cash from the £240m Net Zero Hydrogen Fund supporting commercial hydrogen production projects across the UK.

An ExxonMobil spokesperson said: “Among a range of lower emissions solutions, ExxonMobil has been exploring the introduction of green hydrogen at its Fawley facility.

“As a customer for the HAR2-shortlisted Fawley Green Hydrogen project, green hydrogen, made directly from renewable energy, could not only lower process emissions but also support the production of a range of lower carbon fuels including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).’’

Pierre de Raphelis-Soissan, CEO at Hynamics UK, said: “Today’s announcement reiterates the UK’s commitment to put green hydrogen at the heart of the energy transition.

“We are proud to collaborate with ExxonMobil on this project, as they are committed to reduce their carbon footprint across their major operated assets.

“The Fawley project will provide a reliable source of green hydrogen for at least 15 years, enabling the acceleration in the provision of low carbon energy at ExxonMobil petrochemicals complex, which represents a potential 100,000 tons of CO2 avoided each year.”

Hynamics’ project is among 27 shortlisted for HAR2. The company work with the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero during the due diligence phase to clarify and provide further details on the “opportunity and value for money” the Fawley Green Hydrogen project is said to offer.

Der neue Forschungsansatz von Boeing ähnelt dem von Airbus.

Was Technologien für neue Flugzeugmodelle angeht, beschäftigen sich Airbus und Boeing in den vergangenen Jahren durchaus mit ähnlichen Ideen und Konzepten. Sie setzten aber unterschiedliche Schwerpunkte.

In Sachen Antrieb setzte der europäische Flugzeugbauer im großen Stil auf Wasserstoff, während der amerikanische Konkurrent sich etwas zurückhaltender gab und auf nachhaltige Kraftstoffe fokussierte. Im März trat Airbus aber in Sachen Wasserstoff auf die Bremse und kündigte an, sich vorerst ebenfalls mehr auf Sustainable Aviation Fuel oder kurz SAF zu konzentrieren.

Was die Konstruktion der Tragflächen angeht, tritt nun umgekehrt Boeing auf die Bremse und nähert sich dadurch Airbus an. So berichtete zuerst das Portal The Air Current unter Berufung auf interne Boeing-Dokumente, der Hersteller lege die Entwicklung des Zukunftsfliegers X-66 zunächst auf Eis, um seine Fachkräfte für bestehende Modelle wie 737 Max und 777X zu nutzen.

Nun hat sich auch Boeings Projektpartner Nasa geäußert. Die Raum- und Luftfahrtbehörde teilt mit, die Arbeiten am X-66-Demonstrator würden vorerst pausiert. Sie verweist auf das «komplexere» Flügelkonzept der X-66, genannt Transonic Truss-Braced Wing. Es bezeichnet einen Schulterdecker, dessen lange, dünne Tragflächen über Streben mit dem unteren Teil des Rumpfes verbunden sind.

Doch auf diese Streben wollen Boeing und Nasa nun vorerst verzichten und sich ausschließlich auf die langen, dünnen Tragflächen konzentrieren. Dazu möchten die Partner weiterhin die angeschaffte McDonnell Douglas MD-90 nutzen, um einen Demonstrator zu bauen. Das anvisierte Tragflächenkonzept soll später an verschiedenen Flugzeugen zum Einsatz kommen können.

Eine Annäherung an Airbus ist dies, weil der europäische Konzern ebenfalls an einem langen, dünnen Flügel forscht, der nicht auf ein Flugzeugmodell festgelegt ist. Airbus-Technikchefin Sabine Klauke hatte schon 2023 im Gespräch mit aeroTELEGRAPH gesagt: «Boeing hat ja angekündigt, einen Demonstrator zu fliegen. Viele der Elemente ähneln Elementen, die wir auch nutzen. Nämlich lange Flügel, die aerodynamischer sind, um die Effizienz zu steigern.»

Zum Truss-Braced-Wing sagte sie jedoch bereits damals: «Wir haben uns auch damit beschäftigt. Unsere Einschätzung ist: Einerseits gewinnt man sehr viel durch die lange und dünne Auslegung des Flügels. Andererseits hat man diesen Holm, den man für die Stabilität braucht, über den man aber auch wieder Effizienzen verliert. Und dann sind die Anbau- und Integrationskonzepte für die Triebwerke und andere Systeme ganz anders als heute.»

Mike Sinnett, Chef von Boeings Produktentwicklung, verteidigte die Streben ein Jahr später: «Sie sind kein totes Gewicht, sie sind selbst Flügel. Es sind Flügel, die Flügel hochhalten.» Das habe sich auch im Windkanal erwiesen. «Diesen Teil kennen wir, inklusive aller Wechselwirkungen oder Ineffizienzen, die mit der Strebe einhergehen», argumentierte er.

Auch seien die Streben kein Hindernis bei der Platzierung der Triebwerke. Und die hohen Tragflächen würden Vorteile bringen. «Wenn Sie sich die heutigen Flugzeuge ansehen, sei es der Neo oder die Max oder jedes andere Schmalrumpfflugzeug, sind sie durch das mögliche Nebenstromverhältnis und den Durchmesser der Triebwerke eingeschränkt», sagte Sinnett. «Wenn Sie jemals einen Open Rotor oder einen Open Fan nutzen wollen, ist das bei einem Flugzeug mit niedrigen Tragflächen wirklich schwierig, aber bei einem Flugzeug mit hohen Tragflächen wäre das sehr leicht möglich.»

All diesen Argumenten zum Trotz setzen Boeing und die Nasa ihre Arbeiten nun aber doch zunächst ohne die Streben fort. Die Hintertür: Ist das reine Tragflächenkonzept ein Erfolg wollen sich die Partner womöglich auch wieder mit den Flügelstreben beschäftigen.",https://ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/uaBk9kuTURBXy8wZWU4ZjhmYy0wMDQxLTQ4ODgtYjBlNi04NzU5YzZhMWQyYTMuanBlZ5KVA28AzQbxzQPolQLNBLDNAnbDw94AAaEwAg,N,,2025-04-26 13:56:45.781438

Przełomowe tankowanie samolotu typu Airbus A320 miało miejsce 23 kwietnia 2025 roku na lotnisku w Katowicach-Pyrzowicach, skąd maszyna udała się w rejs do egipskiego Marsa Alam.

Dostawę zrealizowała spółka UNIMOT Aviation, należąca do Grupy UNIMOT, stając się tym samym pierwszym operatorem na polskim rynku, który sprostał wyzwaniom nowego, unijnego otoczenia regulacyjnego.

Zgodnie z rozporządzeniem Parlamentu Europejskiego i Rady (UE) 2023/2405, już od 1 stycznia 2025 roku wszystkie unijne porty lotnicze obsługujące ponad 800 tys. pasażerów rocznie (lub 100 tys. ton cargo) będą zobowiązane do stosowania paliwa SAF w ilości nie mniejszej niż 2% całkowitej masy paliwa lotniczego. Oznacza to, że wymóg ten obejmie osiem największych lotnisk w Polsce – Katowice znalazły się w tym gronie.

SAF – przyszłość lotnictwa

SAF to paliwo powstające z odnawialnych surowców, takich jak oleje roślinne, tłuszcze zwierzęce i odpady rolnicze. Jego stosowanie pozwala na znaczne ograniczenie emisji CO₂ – nawet o 65% – co czyni je jednym z kluczowych rozwiązań w dążeniu do osiągnięcia neutralności klimatycznej sektora lotniczego do 2050 roku.

— „W Unimot Aviation dysponujemy silnym zapleczem logistycznym, które pozwala nam działać szybko i efektywnie. Chcemy być nie tylko dostawcą, ale partnerem wspierającym linie lotnicze i porty w dostosowaniu się do nowych przepisów oraz w budowie zrównoważonej przyszłości lotnictwa” – podkreślił Adam Sikorski, prezes zarządu UNIMOT S.A.

Katowice liderem infrastruktury paliwowej

At first glance it looks like a shipping container, but peer closer and you may see an early glimpse of the future of more sustainable aviation.

The OX1 machine located at the UK’s Oxford Airport is the culmination of years of research into the process of converting carbon dioxide and hydrogen into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Opened in September 2024, the demonstrator can produce 1kg of liquid fuel per day. It will be followed next year by a larger demo plant at Oxford Airport and later by a commercial facility.

OXCCU, the Oxford University spinoff that developed the technology, believes it can contribute to global aviation emissions reduction as the industry eyes net emissions from operations by 2050. Aramco Ventures, the corporate venturing arm of Aramco, became an investor in OXCCU in 2023, alongside other aviation and energy industry players including United Airlines, Eni and Trafigura.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

OXCCU is scaling up a novel catalyst process to convert captured CO2 and hydrogen directly into SAF in a single step. A major challenge facing the sector has been the high cost of synthesising sustainable aviation fuels, explains OXCCU CEO and co-founder Andrew Symes, who studied chemistry at Oxford before working in commodity trading and venture capital.

He says,

What we have is a simplification of existing routes to make sustainable aviation fuel, which enables a lower cost plant and a lower operating cost process,

The OXCCU method is based on the century-old Fischer-Tropsch chemical process – but utilizing a catalyst pioneered by fellow OXCCU co-founder Dr Tiancun Xiao.

“Tiancun published a paper in 2020 that generated worldwide media coverage and which essentially showed for the first time [in the laboratory] that you could go from CO2 and hydrogen directly to the jet fuel range hydrocarbons with one catalyst in a single step – avoiding the need to make intermediates such as carbon monoxide or methanol. That is really where the cost reduction lies and sits behind our core technology,”

While other pathways have higher capital costs due to multiple steps, as well as higher operating costs linked to lower hydrogen efficiency, OXCCU says its approach requires less hydrogen input per amount of jet fuel, which could reduce capital and operating costs, leading to a lower Power-to-Liquid (PtL) SAF.

Net zero challenge

These are important considerations as global air traffic continues to rise and the aviation industry assesses different carbon reduction technologies. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that in order to achieve its 2050 net-zero emissions target, some 65% of the total emissions reductions will in all probability need to be achieved using SAF.

Demand for the fuel may be dictated by a number of factors including the pace of legislative requirements to adopt more sustainable fuels mandated by governments worldwide as well as the voluntary uptake of the fuels by private jet operators.

Symes, says:

We will probably see the emergence of markets where SAF is mandated and we may also see voluntary demand that could also be facilitated by the airlines and fuel suppliers, driven by corporates choosing to buy SAF to offset their Scope 3 emissions,

With much of the current feedstock for sustainable aviation fuels coming from sources such as used cooking oil and agricultural waste, the focus is turning to emerging technologies that may help in satisfying what is expected to be sharply rising demand.

Symes believes the OXCCU demonstrator is an important milestone in that journey and can be scaled up and combined with industrial facilities to utilize point source carbon dioxide emissions.

He says,

The ultimate goal is to have a plant in operation with our technology by the end of the decade,

Aramco is an investor in a number of startups supporting innovation in the energy and mobility sectors.

BITE-SIZED UPDATES FROM AROUND THE WORLD

EMEA

One step forward, two steps back? – The UK government proposal to allow offshore wind developers who haven’t yet secured planning consent to bid into the auction process going forward risks increasing the risk that winning bidders may not end up being able to actually build the project, said Henrik Andersen, CEO of Vestas. Even if they do build one, it may be on a more delayed timeline than in the past, he told Bloomberg. Previous auctions that fix power prices for 15 years have only included fully permitted projects, so this proposed change would deviate from that. The UK has the largest offshore wind capacity in Europe largely thanks to the success of its auction system, though it hasn’t been without hurdles, and Andersen said there needs to be consistency going forward.

More than expected – Holcim reported better than forecast first quarter profit on Friday, with CEO Milijan Gutovic telling reporters the company was well prepared to navigate tariff disruption due to the localised nature of its business. In its last results before spinning off its North American business Amrize, the Swiss maker of building materials posted recurring operating profit of 515 mln Swiss francs ($619 mln) for 1Q 2025, beating forecasts for 494 mln francs in a company-compiled consensus. Five acquisitions helped to add value, said Gutovic, strengthening Holcim’s aggregates and ready-mix businesses in Europe and North America, and specialty building solutions in Latin America. Holcim plans to spin off all of Amrize to shareholders by end of June, though the transaction still requires approval from the company’s shareholders. (Reuters)

Top Forest – Finnish forestry group Stora Enso’s first-quarter operating profit beat market expectations on Friday, though it said that US President Donald Trump’s tariffs would lead to subdued market demand. CEO Hans Sohlstrom said the direct impact of the current tariff rates was limited, as the company’s sales to the US account for just below 3% of group sales in 2024. The CEO said the key is to reposition and renegotiate prices in the US to compensate for tariffs. Its shares were up 1% on Friday morning. Stora also said its expected ramp-up of its new packaging board line in Oulu, Finland, will have a negative impact of around €100 mln on its annual adjusted operating profit. (Reuters)

No to dirty ads – A Dutch city successfully defended the world’s first law to ban fossil fuel advertising, setting a precedent for other cities across Europe. The Hague introduced a high-carbon ad ban, outlawing any publicly and privately funded advertising for petrol and diesel, aviation, and cruise ships. The Dutch trade association for travel agencies and the travel company TUI filed lawsuits against the ban. (NL Times)

Cut the fossils – ClientEarth lawyers are urging the EU Commission to revise its proposed Clean Industrial Deal State Aid Framework (CISAF), warning it enables fossil gas subsidies and lacks essential environmental safeguards. The CISAF aims to simplify approval for state aid in renewable energy and clean tech, but ClientEarth says it falls short of supporting a truly green transition. “Europe claims to be enabling a cleaner industry, yet current State aid rules go as far as to explicitly endorse fossil gas as a decarbonisation solution,” said ClientEarth lawyer Stephanie Nieuwbourg.. “Taxpayers money should be directed to genuinely sustainable projects.” The framework, like the current Climate, Energy and Environmental Aid Guidelines (CEEAG), still allows support for fossil gas infrastructure labeled ‘hydrogen-ready’ – a loophole that could lock in fossil fuel use, according to ClientEarth. “It’s a missed opportunity to take real action to prevent aid from supporting environmentally harmful activities, including fossil gas use,” Nieuwbourg added. ClientEarth calls on the Commission to strengthen the framework before today’s consultation deadline, 25 April.

ASIA PACIFIC

For sale – Malaysia’s Bursa Carbon Exchange (BCX) has announced the inaugural auction of the nation’s first technology-based carbon credits from a methane avoidance project, scheduled for June 18. Developed by Cenergi SEA Berhad and Monsoon Carbon and registered under Verra, the project aims to reduce GHG emissions from industrial facilities by capturing biogas generated in open wastewater treatment systems, and preventing it from escaping into the atmosphere, the exchange said in an email. The first project activity is located in Langkap, Perak state.

SAF procurement – Taiwan-headquartered EVA Air has signed sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) procurement agreements with three suppliers: Associated Energy Group (AEG FUELS), COSMO Oil Marketing, and Formosa Petrochemical Corporation, according to a company statement. The airline’s flights departing from Europe have been operating with a 2% SAF blend since Q1 2025, and the new agreements will further broaden the use of SAF within its global operations. EVA Air said it will begin SAF integration at key hubs in North America, Japan, and Taiwan from Q2 this year.

Reservation – Japan GX Group, which operates a carbon credit marketplace, has obtained a patent it claims can allow its corporate clients to have “reservation rights” to J-Credits that are not yet issued, according to a statement released this week. Securing carbon credits in advance will make it easier to formulate and execute mid- to long-term plans as well as hedge the risk of price increases, the company said, adding it aims to launch a product based on the patent by FY2027.

Nuclear push – India is considering allowing foreign companies to own up to 49% of its nuclear power plants, Reuters reported, in a bid to rapidly expand atomic capacity and cut carbon emissions. The move would require amendments to the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act and the Atomic Energy Act, which the government aims to push through Parliament’s monsoon session. Domestic firms including Reliance, Tata Power, Adani, and Vedanta have also discussed investing about $26 bln into the sector, currently a state monopoly with just over 8 GW capacity.

AMERICAS

New E15 push – A group of US House members is reigniting a push to allow the year-round sale of E15 fuels – or gasoline blended with 15% ethanol. A group of 25 lawmakers announced this week that they are asking the White House to permit the sale of E15 fuels from June 1 to Sep. 15 across the nation. In February, the administration affirmed it would allow the year-round sales across eight Midwest states beginning Apr. 28. It’s not the first time the House has pushed for an expanded measure. Last year, a bipartisan group of representatives introduced legislation that would have allowed the year-round sale of E15 fuels, although the bill died in committee.

VOLUNTARY

“Just” credits – International carbon registry Verra is planning a May launch of a new methodology for the accelerated retirement of coal-fired power plants using a just transition, it said. It will be the first “people-centered transition credit methodology” in the world, it added. Transition credits, a new type of credit, championed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), is meant to drive early shutdowns of coal-fired power plants and must be priced at a minimum of $30 per tonne of CO2e, for them to be viable, according to experts.

China biochar credits – China’s first biochar carbon credit project, which registered on Puro on Thursday, has issued its initial batch of 330 CORCs. Developed by MioTech with Nanjing Nian’da Environmental Technology and Nanjing Forestry University, the project converts agricultural waste into biochar for carbon storage and soil improvement. The facility plans to expand production to 4,500 CORCs annually by 2027. MioTech is also targeting 50,000 tons of CDR credits by 2027 across several carbon removal methods. Separately, Puro on Thursday announced a partnership with French platform CrystalChain to strengthen digital MRV and streamline CORC issuance.

Woodland Code update – The UK’s Woodland Carbon Code is having a refresh with a new version under development. A consultation on version 3 of the code will open next week with proposed changes including: updating rules to encourage more projects on crofted land, updating data in the additionality cashflow spreadsheet, providing clearer information on requirements and guidance, and changing the minimum duration for projects in line with international standards. The draft version will be shared next week. Announcement here.

Philanthropic gestures – Non-profit Planete Urgence has launched ‘Climate Philanthropy’, a new climate action financing tool for companies to contribute towards climate action projects such as mangrove restoration without using carbon markets. The tool is built on a “100% virtuous contribution logic”, whereby companies finance projects outside their value chain and receive an impact certificate that documents the carbon measurement of the project over 10 years and other indicators related to biodiversity and human development. The certificate can then be integrated into usual reporting and evaluation frameworks. More details here.

AND FINALLY…

Please don’t stop the music – DJs for Climate Action transformed nightclubs into venues for climate awareness across the world on Earth Day, Grist reported. The volunteer group, originally focused on lowering CO2 emissions from DJ travel, offers toolkits for local organisers to promote sustainability at parties, to encourage venues, promotes, and DJs to host Earth Night events.",https://carbon-pulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/favicon.png,N,,2025-04-26 09:57:13.212181

,,2025-04-26 12:32:15+00:00,Formula 1® - The Official F1® Website,The 'important' lessons F1 is learning from the development of sustainable fuels in F2 and ...,F1,,,,,https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/the-important-lessons-f1-is-learning-from-the-development-of-sustainable.5kWRfgxV7hg9NIXysGnCwf,"Just as Pirelli were able to develop the larger F1 tyre compound based on the findings generated in F2, the use of Aramco’s 100% Advanced Sustainable Fuels in F2 and F3 has been developed to be ‘drop-in’.
Drop-in fuels are developed to be chemically identical to conventional fuels, making them compatible with existing engine and power unit technologies.
“When we speak about sustainable fuels, we need to make sure that the full life cycle of the production remains sustainable,” Michot continues.
Both Championships will continue to use Aramco’s 100% Advanced Sustainable Fuels for now, but both will eventually adopt fully synthetic fuel.
“Using sustainable fuel has not increased the cost of seasons in Formula 2 or Formula 3.","Innovation in Formula 1 goes beyond the looks of the cars and, with looming regulation changes on the horizon, fuels are becoming an ever-increasing focus for teams and power unit manufacturers in the chase for performance.

As they balance championship aspirations in 2025 with the creation of the all-new cars for the 2026 regulation change, the fuels set to be used in F1 in 2026 are already powering the FIA Formula 2 and Formula 3 Championships.

In a collaboration with Aramco, the Advanced Sustainable Fuel active in both Championships has reached a new impressive standard, with all 52 cars running on 100% sustainable fuel.

It is a massive step forward in the development of the type of fuel that will be used in Formula 1 next season, and has exceeded expectations, as F2 and F3 CEO Bruno Michel explains.

“It’s been going very, very well. We started this partnership with Aramco a few years ago, started with a 55% sustainable fuel, and it was part of the plan to make sure we were arriving at 100% normally in 2026.

“But because of the fantastic job Aramco has been doing, we’ve been able to anticipate it and do it this season, which has been a great thing.”

Both of the junior categories have been used as a testbed for F1 in the past, such as with the increased size of the 18-inch Pirelli tyres, first used in F2 in 2020 before F1 adopted the same tyre size from 2022.

Just as Pirelli were able to develop the larger F1 tyre compound based on the findings generated in F2, the use of Aramco’s 100% Advanced Sustainable Fuels in F2 and F3 has been developed to be ‘drop-in’.

Drop-in fuels are developed to be chemically identical to conventional fuels, making them compatible with existing engine and power unit technologies. They remove the need for any major modifications to the cars to use them, and reduce CO2 emissions in the process.

FIA Director of Single Seaters Nikolas Tombazis says the work done in F2 is directly relevant to what will come in F1, allowing the governing body to gather data ahead of the introduction of such fuels in Formula 1 next season.

“Making sure the performance is fairly similar in Formula 2 is an important first step. The fact that the fuel is drop-in fuel is important. In addition, there are some relatively minor aspects related to reliability, fuel tanks and stuff like that, maybe there's some small chemical differences.

“It's important to check to make sure we don't have any issues on the cars. These lessons Formula 2 are learning, I think, are taken note of for Formula 1. So that's important.”

Crucially however, the fuels used in F2 and F3 have not come at the cost of any performance, in accordance with the targets set by the Championships.

F2 and F3 Technical Director Pierre-Alain Michot says the collaboration with technical partners has been a big success, with the product used on track this season ahead of schedule and performing as expected.

“The clear target was to have no impact on performance and for Mecachrome, our engine partner, to make sure that the engine was as reliable as before,” Michot explains.

“We worked quite hard with Mecachrome and Aramco to make sure that we could define a good formula for this fuel. We tested several different fuels, did a lot of mileage on the dyno and in the development car before releasing it on the track and on 52 cars.

F2: Verschoor makes last-lap pass for Jeddah Feature Race win

“It proved to be quite successful, the performance is there, the reliability is there, so we just need to continue on this path.”

While Formula 1 and the FIA has been watching closely, the use of drop-in and fully sustainable fuels have the potential to have an even wider importance in the automotive industry.

Development of such fuel could pave the way for adaptation for mass market use that would eventually filter through to road car use.

Part of that adoption process is already underway, as Aramco continues to work on their development of the fuel whilst, at the same time, ensuring the process of creating the fuel is just as sustainable as the product itself.

“When we speak about sustainable fuels, we need to make sure that the full life cycle of the production remains sustainable,” Michot continues. “Aramco is working that out as well, to make sure that the energy needed to produce this sustainable and synthetic fuel comes from sustainable energy as well.

F2: Lindblad becomes youngest winner in Formula 2 history as he inherits maiden victory in Jeddah Sprint

“That’s part of the journey, and they are making sure that the full cycle [of producing the fuel] is sustainable and not just the final product. That’s one of the main targets and the biggest challenge to achieve that.”

“Aramco are working really hard to build more plants to make sure they can produce sustainable fuel at a wider range. For now, it’s quite a niche market but the aim is to make it for mass market.

“We do that by going step-by-step and they are working out how to make it happen in the near future.”

While Formula 1 teams gear up to adopt their own sustainable fuels for 2026, Formula 2 and 3 will continue to press on with Aramco, with the next target already in sight.

Both Championships will continue to use Aramco’s 100% Advanced Sustainable Fuels for now, but both will eventually adopt fully synthetic fuel.

That development is already well underway and holds exciting potential not just for the future of the FIA single seater pyramid and Formula 1, but the wider automotive industry.

“The next step is synthetic fuel,” Michel confirms. “That’s the next step in our development programme with Aramco and we are still working with them on that flat out at the moment.

“Using sustainable fuel has not increased the cost of seasons in Formula 2 or Formula 3. Aramco is supplying this fuel free of charge to the teams. So instead of increasing costs, it’s diminished the cost of the season.”

Tombazis adds that it has been a hugely useful learning experience for the FIA to have Aramco’s fuel used in Formula 2 and Formula 3 ahead of F1 adopting such fuels from ’26.

While each team will be developing their own fuels in collaboration with their own technical partners, the performance levels, positive environmental factors, and high level of competitiveness of both Championships bodes well for Formula 1 in 2026.

EXPLAINED: What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel and why is F1 investing in it?

“It’s quite an interesting and complicated process. Of course, in Formula 1, we are delighted in the FIA there’s an opening grant from Formula 2 with Aramco and we’re very respectful of this process.

“That's the additional challenge in Formula 1, and I think it's very useful that these initial steps taken in the lower categories. I think we'll complete the picture next year when Formula 1 makes this big step.”",https://media.formula1.com/image/upload/t_16by9South/f_auto/q_auto/v1745588591/fom-website/2025/Formula%202/GettyImages-2211119217.jpg,N,,2025-04-26 08:56:08.831283

UAV has made a number of alternative aircraft investments including:

Hybrid-electric

Hydrogen-powered

Electric Air Taxis (eVTOLs)

Andrew Chang, head of United Airlines Ventures (UAV), said:

""If successful, JetZero has the potential to evolve our core mainline business by developing aircraft with a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers while increasing fuel efficiency across our network,""

""United Airlines Ventures® was created to support our efforts to find innovative companies that can enhance the customer travel experience and help the airline lower its carbon footprint, and we believe JetZero reflects that philosophy.""

Tom O'Leary, CEO and co-founder of JetZero, said:

""United's investment in our company signals the industry's belief that new, innovative technology is needed in order to achieve the efficiency and cost savings that will be required to meet the continued growth in demand for air travel across the globe,""

""JetZero is focused on one key technology – the airframe – that enables us to address all of the barriers to growth. This program is the only one in development today that promises efficiency and an elevated customer experience.""

The design contributes to a more efficient operation due to its shape and the higher altitude at which it will fly.

The aircraft design has the potential to also offer improvements to the passenger experience like flexible seating options, larger seats across all classes and dedicated overhead bin space for each seat.

Additionally, the design streamlines the boarding process with a main boarding door that is wider than that of a comparably sized aircraft, leading to multiple aisles and passenger cabin bays for more efficient passenger distribution.

It may further enhance accessibility by featuring wider aisles and handicap-accessible lavatories, creating a comfortable travel environment for all passengers and in-flight crew.

Delta Air Lines is also partnering with JetZero, expecting a more sustainable aircraft as a part of the plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.",https://fl360aero.com/upload/blogs/2085_GpYrZooaIAAMC5W.jpg,N,,2025-04-26 08:56:13.570135

Low-Cost Operations From Saudi Arabia

According to ch-aviation, flyadeal currently has a fleet of 38 aircraft, comprising 27 A320-200neos and 11 A320-200s. Last year, Saudia Group announced an order for 105 Airbus aircraft , including 54 A321neo aircraft for Saudia and 12 A320neos and 39 A321neos for flyadeal. The deal, announced during the Future Aviation Forum 2024 in Riyadh, was the largest aircraft deal in Saudi aviation.

The new deal supports Saudia Group’s plans to enhance its operations and modernize its fleet, while improving aircraft maintenance and increasing efficiency. The widebody order marks a new era for flyadeal, as it looks to access new long-haul markets and attract new customers. Since its first flight in September 2017, flyadeal has flown over 12 million customers.

Last year, Cirium, an aviation analytics company, ranked the national carrier Saudia as the second most on-time airline globally, with 86.35% on-time arrivals and 88.82% on-time departures. The ranking puts the airline on par with other global leaders, including Aeromexico, Delta, LATAM, and Qatar Airways. Notably, flyadeal was ranked the second most on-time low-cost carrier for two consecutive months, highlighting its commitment to offering passengers a seamless experience.

Saudi Aviation And Airbus Orders

In total, Saudia Group has a fleet of 194 aircraft, with 191 to be delivered in the coming years. The Group’s expansion will support the country’s economic growth and contribute to key strategic initiatives aimed at connecting the Kingdom to the world. Saudi Arabia is set to see high demand for air travel in the coming years, owing to the Riyadh Expo 2030 and the Kingdom’s hosting of the 2034 FIFA World Cup .

As of the end of March 2025, Airbus has delivered about 136 aircraft to 49 customers. During the last month of Q1 2025, the manufacturer delivered 71 aircraft to 37 customers, with orders of up to 211 aircraft. By the end of March 2025, the A330neo had received over 1,800 firm orders from more than 130 customers across the globe.

Throughout the year, Airbus has delivered four A330-900s to CIT Leasing (Malaysia Airlines), Delta Air Lines, Cebu Pacific, and another one to CIT Leasing. As with Airbus’ other new-generation aircraft, the A330 family can operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and targets 100% compatibility by 2030.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/a330neo-first-flight-take-off-4.jpg,N,,2025-04-26 10:56:09.451075

Up next? A plane that's essentially one giant wing.

The airline on Thursday unveiled a plan to buy up to 200 of the 'blended-wing body' aircraft from California-based aerospace startup JetZero. The startup wants to compete with Airbus and Boeing by creating a plane that burns half the fuel of a similarly sized, traditional tube-and-wing plane.

The 250-passenger ""Z4"" aircraft is not yet certified, but the company is aiming for a 2030 commercial launch and successfully flew a subscale prototype in 2024.

Andrew Chang, the managing director of United Airlines Ventures, the division that funds these innovation-focused investments, told Business Insider the Z4's oversized wing could create a ""living room in the sky.""

""Everything around the customer travel experience — how they sit in the plane, board, and deplane, and how [crewmembers] serve them — can be reinvented around the new space within this new aircraft design,"" he said.

Chang added that the conditional purchase agreement relies on JetZero's ability to prove its revolutionary design with a full-sized demonstrator by 2027 and meet United's operational and business requirements on things like cost, fuel burn, and safety.

But he was confident JetZero, which the US Air Force has also backed, could deliver: ""If you look at the management team, there's a lot of institutional experience and knowledge there from companies like Airbus and Boeing.""

More wing means more cabin real estate

JetZero's futuristic plane combines the wings and fuselage into a single lifting surface. This unique airframe dramatically widens the cabin, allowing United to accommodate over a dozen seats per row.

Widebody passenger aircraft today max out at 10-abreast rows. The densest configuration ever proposed was 11 seats across on the world's largest commercial airliner, the Airbus A380 — though no carriers signed on.

The Z4 will be shorter than traditional dual-aisle planes. Chang said that instead of 20 or 30 rows of seats, there may be only 10 or 15.

There would also be more aisles for navigating the cabin, and up to four entry doors, improving boarding and deplaning efficiency.

Chang added that there would be economy and premium seats with Starlink WiFi and media to create a living-room-like vibe and likely some reimagined spaces: ""Every square foot of real estate, you want to have revenue passengers on it,"" he said.

It's unclear what new spaces United could develop, but JetZero competitor Natilus has some ideas for its in-development 200-person blended-wing aircraft design called Horizon.

Speaking to BI in October, Natilus CEO Aleksey Matyushev said Horizon could accommodate lounge or playroom areas. He added that this could offset the possible complaint of the longer rows reducing the number of window seats.

Delta Air Lines is also working with JetZero as a partner developer. It said the cabin could accommodate accessible seats and lavatories, and dedicated overhead bin space for every passenger.

Alaska Airlines' investment, which also has the option for plane orders, said the airframe would provide a quieter flying experience.

JetZero could replace some of United's old Boeing planes

JetZero said its Z4 plane's better lift and lower drag could cut fuel burn by up to 50% per passenger mile while still flying up to about 5,750 miles nonstop. It would use conventional jet engines and run on traditional or sustainable aviation fuel.

Chang said this efficiency and subsequent cost cuts could make the new jet a replacement for midsize airplanes like the Boeing 757 and the Boeing 767. United plans to retire these older aircraft by 2026 and 2030, respectively.

For example, United said in a press release that a flight from Newark, New Jersey, to Palma de Mallorca, Spain, would use up to 45% less fuel than the twin-aisle aircraft flying the route today.

United's Boeing 767 operates that summer seasonal transatlantic trek. JetZero's new aircraft could take over, and it would fit into the existing airport infrastructure on both sides of the pond.

JetZero's expected commercialization is years away. United plans to take on next-generation aircraft like the Airbus A321XLR and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner as more immediate and reliable replacements for the 757 and 767.

If certified, JetZero's aircraft would provide United with another high-range, high-capacity, and cost-effective fleet option that could comfortably sit in between.

It would have more range and capacity than the A321XLR but less than United's 787-9 and 787-10. The Z4 could hold a handful more people than the airline's smallest Dreamliner variant, the 787-8.

That’s why getting to that next step, the next phase of growth, will come with the XLR.” Air Canada sees the small single-aisle A220, assembled in Mirabel, Que., as the backbone of its modern fleet.","The immense Airbus manufacturing site in Hamburg, Germany, is a city unto itself. Several of the 18,000 employees who work here refer to it as a “town within a town,” with low-slung office buildings set on modern cobbled roads, near spotless aircraft hangars, cacophonous assembly lines, restaurants, cafeterias, and—naturally—an adjoining airport.

“Only the hairdresser is missing,” an Airbus staffer joked on a tour in early April, where Skies was the only Canadian aviation publication with exclusive, behind-the-scenes access.

Hamburg is the second-largest Airbus factory in Europe, after the facility in Toulouse, France, that also holds the company’s Commercial Aircraft headquarters. Its nearly 100 buildings are snugly packed onto about 3.7 square kilometres of land, the size of about 1,000 soccer fields.

“It’s like a little island, all built on water,” another tour member said, referencing the site’s northern border on Elbe River, and smaller waterways along its south and eastern fringes.

Hamburg is the nerve centre of the Airbus A320 family of narrowbody airliners, where structural assembly and final assembly of the A319, A320, A321, A321LR and A321XLR (extra long-range) is carried out in efficient, carefully regimented shifts.

The site is also crucial to the widebody A330 and A350 programmes; the forward and rear fuselages of both types are manufactured and equipped in Hamburg before delivery to Toulouse in massive Airbus A330 airlifters (better-known as the BelugaXL).

Also in Hamburg: the A320 and A330 cabin definition centre and design studio, where airline clients from around the world meet with Airbus staff to firm up the interior layout of new aircraft orders—everything from seating configuration to lavatory fixtures and carpet fabric.

“It’s really the place for cabin definition,” said Alexander Jürs, manager, Customer Service and Communication at Airbus. “There’s one place in the world for Airbus where do we do it, and that’s here in Hamburg.”

Today, it’s the XLR that grabs most of the attention, thanks in part to a small delegation from Air Canada that includes Alexandre Lefevre, vice-president, Network Planning and Fleet Strategy.

“The XLR will give us the ability to open up new destinations, open up new markets,” said Lefevre. “There is a perfect match between that product and what we need.”

YEAR-ROUND ROUTES

Air Canada is betting on the XLR as a game-changer, integral to an ambitious growth strategy to open up year-round transatlantic service and add new overseas routes. The airline currently offers seasonal routes to Europe in widebody aircraft like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A330, but those are typically only profitable in summer, when demand is high.

Overseas traffic dips considerably in winter and the shoulder seasons, but Air Canada believes it could still sustain routes on a narrowbody like the XLR, which boasts a range of 4,700 nautical miles (8,700 kilometres), seating capacity between 180 and 244 passengers, and 30 percent less fuel burn and operating costs than previous-generation aircraft.

“It gives airlines the possibility to use it for secondary airports, to use it together with their widebodies,” said Suchithra Raman, single-aisle marketing manager, Commercial and International, at Airbus.

“Going that far on a single-aisle aircraft with single-aisle economics, is something completely new. It’s a game-changer for the world.”

Air Canada is also openly working to become one of the world’s top 10 airlines, as measured by available seat miles, and sees the XLR as key to achieving that goal. At the time of writing, the airline was ranked No. 13 in the world by ASM, slightly behind British Airways but ahead of Lufthansa and Air France.

“Size matters in the industry,” said Lefevre in a sit-down interview. “When you get to be a bigger airline, you’ve got bigger purchasing power, you’ve got a bigger footprint, more connections. The more connections we offer, the more passengers we can attract, our loyalty program gets bigger— everything gets enhanced by the size of the airline.”

“It’s not a race to be the biggest,” he added. “In our case, we feel like the volume and the spread of the airline will help all the commercial parts of the company to be more successful.”

Air Canada’s first XLR is on the assembly line in Hamburg, and is expected for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2025, on a lease from Air Lease Corporation. The airline has ordered 30 XLRs in total, a mixture of owned and leased aircraft.

It’s expected the XLR will enter service within three months of delivery, potentially grabbing market share from U.S. and European competitors by attracting transatlantic customers who normally connect through U.S. airports.

“When you look at Toronto and Montreal, our two main transatlantic hubs, they’re really on the shortest path on the transatlantic,” said Lefevre.

“Almost all the flights from the U.S. overfly Toronto and Montreal … [with the XLR] you get the range to serve so many of those destinations.”

EXTRA-LONG RANGE

The XLR is based on the A321neo (a lower-case acronym for new engine option), and entered service in 2024 with Spanish carrier Iberia and Ireland’s Aer Lingus.

It shares the A321neo’s option for twin Pratt & Whitney GTF or CFM International LEAP-1A turbofan engines, can operate with the same crew, and has 86 percent commonality for spare parts, Airbus said. It claims all the features of a modern long-range aircraft, with lie-flat business class seats, wider economy seats, and larger overhead bins.

The main difference-maker is its 12,960-litre rear centre tank (RCT), which enables 15 percent more range than the A321LR (long-range) version and 30 percent more range than the base-level A321neo, in the same came cargo space as two additional centre tanks (ACTs).

“On the A321LR, you had the option of putting up to three ACTs,” said Raman. “But that meant you’re putting a box within a box in your cargo compartment. In terms of efficiency, the XLR beats that, because this is integrated into the fuselage.”

Due to the extra fuel capacity, the XLR’s maximum takeoff weight increases to 101 tonnes (101,000 kilograms). Pilots can adjust the aircraft’s multi-function control and display unit (MCDU) for more efficient take-off performance, and the aircraft has some physical differences from the rest of the A320 family including an inboard single-slotted flap, and reinforced landing gear to accommodate heavier loads.

The aircraft’s 11-hour maximum flight can connect any European market to Toronto and Montreal, with 30 percent fewer carbon dioxide emissions per seat, 50 percent sustainable aviation fuel compatibility, and a 50 percent quieter noise footprint, according to Airbus.

It also enables direct flights to Paris and London from Calgary and Vancouver, though Air Canada is more closely eyeing transpacific routes from its B.C. hub.

“On a per-seat basis, it’s way cheaper to fly widebodies,” said Lefevre, noting trip cost and cost-per-seat are key metrics. “But if you cannot fill the widebody, the equation doesn’t work … if the demand is not that strong, I need to right size my trip cost.”

“The XLR is a nice fit for us.”

EUROPEAN EXPANSION

Canada’s vast geography and small population have long bedevilled domestic carriers, but the country’s winter climate is also a major concern for international travel. A flight to Montreal from Toulouse can seem idyllic in July or August; less so in grey, bone-chilling November.

“We’re flying widebodies at 250 to 300 seats for each flight, and that’s too much [in the winter],” said Lefevre. “When you get a platform like the XLR, you get to offer the number of seats [to match] demand, and you can also offer more frequency.”

Air Canada projects offering five weekly flights from Montreal to Toulouse year-round with the XLR, and plans to significantly grow its Montreal hub by adding service to key markets in South America and northern Africa.

Target destinations include Lima, Peru; Dakar, Senegal; Marrakech, Morocco; Madeira, Portugal; and Malaga, Spain; along with secondary markets in northwestern Europe like Edinburgh, Scotland, and Nantes and Marseilles, France.

“You’re going to see the XLR also flying in North America,” noted Lefevre.

“Having that lie-flat premium and efficient experience on transcontinental flights from Toronto and Montreal to cities like Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, San [Francisco], LAX — you’re going to see that product going through. We’re also looking at opportunities on the leisure side.”

As part of a bid to boost its customer experience, Air Canada is rolling out a new “glowing hearted” cabin design across much of its fleet, aimed at conveying Canadian values like friendliness, hospitality, and emotional warmth.

“The glowing-hearted concept (is) about being consistent across the whole journey,” said Lefevre.

“But it’s also about showing our values. I think all airlines are trying to differentiate themselves, and showing who we truly are. We’re Canadian, we’re welcoming, and that’s really something we want to showcase — warm, Canadian feeling and the welcoming experience that Canadians can deliver.”

XLR ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE

In a far-flung section of a hushed assembly line in Hamburg, Lefevre stepped into the XLR fuselage for the first time. He was visibly pleased to see the aircraft, still very much a work in progress, which Air Canada initially ordered in 2022.

Deliveries were slated to begin in the first quarter of 2024, with the final aircraft arriving in 2027. Those dates have been pushed back, and the airline has been vocal about its eagerness to integrate the XLR into its fleet as soon as possible.

Air Canada is in the midst of a major fleet expansion, with 91 new aircraft scheduled to arrive over the next four years. This includes 31 Canadian-made Airbus A220s, 11 Boeing 787-10 Dreamliners, 11 Boeing 737 Max aircraft, and one 787-9 Dreamliner.

“Some of them will replace older aircraft, but the vast majority will come for growth,” said Lefevre. “We will be growing the airline more than five percent every year.”

The XLR makes up roughly a third of the aircraft in this planned expansion, with 15 to be leased through Air Lease Corporation, five leased through AerCap, and six being acquired in a purchase agreement that includes the rights to acquire 14 more of the type.

“It’s going to help us on the next phase,” said Lefevre. “We’re at a phase now where we feel we’re covering all the big markets — all the big dots. The next opportunity may be less obvious, because the demand is smaller. That’s why getting to that next step, the next phase of growth, will come with the XLR.”

Air Canada sees the small single-aisle A220, assembled in Mirabel, Que., as the backbone of its modern fleet. But the XLR is seen as an ideal complement to the A220’s continental connectivity.

“The XLR is kind of the extension of the A220 story we’ve got in North America,” said Lefevre. “If you are a passenger connecting from the U.S.— you live in Dallas, and you want to go to any point in Europe, you board an A220, connect in Montreal, and you get to the final destination on an XLR.”

“That’s a combination that will give us a lot of new origin-destination pairs.”",https://assets.skiesmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/A321neo_ACA1.jpg,N,,2025-04-26 08:56:26.325902

Naig was a guest Friday on the Iowa PBS show “Iowa Press,” where he also discussed the challenges facing Iowa’s agricultural economy, bird flu and eminent domain.

Naig, a Republican and native Iowan, has been ag secretary since 2018 and was reelected in 2022.

No official bid for governor

Naig said the announcement from Gov. Kim Reynolds that she would not be seeking reelection came as “a bit of a surprise” that has caused him to pause and consider the possibility of running for the position.

“I still, at this stage of my life, I want to be of service to the state of Iowa, and I want to think about the best ways that I can do that,” Naig said.

Naig said at this time the discussion is on his “side of the table” with family, friends and supporters to decide if a run for governor is the best path forward.

When pressed for more details, like staff and campaign strategies in the event of gubernatorial bid, Naig said he’s not to that point.

“This is around my kitchen table, this is about me getting into a planter tractor here in the next couple weeks and giving a lot of thought to it,” Naig said. “That’s not to say we’re not talking to a lot of folks.”

Naig said Republicans in Iowa have a deep bench of potential candidates. Attorney General Brenna Bird, Sen. Mike Bousselot, House Speaker Pat Grassley, and Rep. Bobby Kaufmann have said they are considering the gig.

Changes impacting ag in Iowa

Naig said the agricultural economy in Iowa is “tough” and while there were positive trade outcomes from the first Trump administration’s foreign policy, Iowa farmers are in a worse position now to weather potential trade wars.

“We don’t have the kind of buffer in our ag economy — profitability and margins are not where they were even then, today,” Naig said. “There’s not a lot of room to absorb that shock.”

Naig said this was a message sent to U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins during her recent visit to Iowa, and that the ag department should be ready to support farmers.

Naig said he is “encouraged” by the countries that are coming to the table to negotiate better trade deals, and hopes to see greater domestic consumption of ag commodities by expanding the ethanol industry and branching into sustainable aviation fuel.

“What you hope and certainly what we’re advocating for is unleashing that domestic consumption, but needing to make sure that we’ve got an expanded trade portfolio as well,” Naig said.

Naig said India could be a potential “game changer” if the country were able to make a trade agreement with the country.

Bird flu

The nation is in its fourth year of an outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has impacted more than 168 million birds nationally.

Naig said he is considering options, like a vaccine for birds, now that he was not willing to consider three years ago. He also said there needs to be more people in the animal industries sector of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to respond to outbreaks like HPAI.

The Iowa secretary said he did not believe a “herd immunity” approach, which has been suggested by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was “a workable solution” to the bird flu.

Other issues

Naig has been pushing for the Legislature to expand the Choose Iowa program, which helps to market and support Iowa grown products and producers.

One of its programs is similar to the recently cut federal Local Food for School and Local Food Purchase Assistance programs, which were COVID-era funds to help schools and local institutions purchase from local farmers.

Naig said he hopes the Choose Iowa versions, which this year were just pilot programs, could be a permanent program, funded through regular appropriations rather than short-term funding pools.

“We want something that can actually stand the test of time, be around, be something that you can plan for,” Naig said.

Naig also addressed the issue of eminent domain, which has been a growing topic of debate across the state, particularly in relation to a carbon sequestration pipeline that has planned more than 1,000 miles of pipeline in the state.

“It should be rare,” Naig said. “It should be the least desirable option to get something done, and there should be overwhelming voluntary agreements in place before something like a project — any project with eminent domain — would go forward.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-83/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/naig-on-iowa-press-1024x6611745618586.png?h=21017897&itok=R-eoxw0B,N,,2025-04-26 08:56:39.194551

Abstract

:

The development of new technologies for the production of renewable energy is fundamental to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the search for new energy generation methods that are environmentally responsible, socially rational, and economically viable is gaining momentum in order to mitigate carbon footprint. The aviation sector is responsible for a significant fraction of greenhouse gas emissions; for this reason, the decarbonisation of this sector must be investigated using biorefinery models. This study presents a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for optimising the design and configuration of the supply chain in different states of Brazil for the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green diesel and gasoline, using microalgae cultivated in sugarcane vinasse as the raw material. The technology of hydrothermal liquefaction was assessed in terms of its capacity to convert microalgae without need for the energy-intensive drying step. The MILP model was developed in the LINGO v.20 software using a library of physical and economic process models. We consider the selection of processes based on the object of total minimum cost, with optimal production plant scaling and regional supply chain design, including an assessment of resources and final product distribution. A case study was implemented in Brazil, considering different regions of the country and its local demands for fuels. São Paulo is the most profitable state, with a cash flow of 1071.09 and an IRR of 36.19%, far outperforming the rest. Transport emissions alone represent between 0.6 and 8.6% of emissions generated by the model. The costs of raw materials, mainly hydrogen (57%) and electricity (27%) represent the main costs evaluated in the model. The production cost (MUS$/TJ biofuel) is in the range of 0.009–0.011. Finally, changes in the cost of electricity have the greatest impact on the model.

1. Introduction

The depletion of fossil fuels, waste generation, increasing energy demands, and cli-mate change mitigation have raised concerns about sustainable and renewable energy pro-duction [1,2], and the energy transition will help in proper waste management and the development of a green economy [3]. Biomass (referring to those organic materials that can be converted into useful energy) is a green and sustainable renewable resource [4]. About 89% of biomass is used as heat in combustion, 7% is used as transportation fuel, and 4% is used to produce electricity [5]. Renewable energies such as biomass fuel (biofuels) have high potential to replace fossil fuels, [6] and have the advantage of being renewable sources of carbon [7]. Biofuels include liquid (biodiesel, bioethanol, bio-oil), solid (biochar, pellets), and gaseous (biogas, syngas) fuels and can be used to generate power and heat, or as a transportation fuel [3,6]. Biofuels are obtained through the conversion of biomass, which includes algae biomass, animal residues, wastes, and lignocellulosic biomass. Depending on their feedstock, nature, and properties, the biofuels produced from them can be divided into four categories: first-, second-, third-, and fourth-generation fuels [8,9,10].

Sugarcane is one of the main crops worldwide and Brazil is its largest producer, fol-lowed by India, China, and Thailand [11]. Sugarcane is mainly used for the production of sugar and alcohol. However, an important by-product of the sugarcane industry is bagasse, a fibrous material that is used as a raw material for renewable energy production [12]. In addition to bagasse, vinasse is another by-product of the sugarcane industry that can be used for energy generation [13]. It is estimated that for every litre of ethanol, be-tween 10 and 14 L of vinasse are produced [14,15]. This by-product has a high organic content; therefore, it is not advisable to dispose of it in water bodies. Among its main uses, vinasse has potential for biogas production through anaerobic digestion [1,16] and can also be used as a culture medium for the production of microalgae biomass [17].

Microalgae are microorganisms that use sunlight and carbon dioxide to generate chemical energy while producing oxygen, i.e., they store the sun’s energy in the form of organic compounds such as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These compounds can then be used as a source of energy or feedstock for biofuels [18,19,20]. They are considered as fundamental sources of biomass for biofuel production because of their enormous benefits: (1) they can be cultivated in fresh and salt water; (2) they display high growth and production rates compared to other plants; (3) they require less water consumption for growth than terrestrial crops; and (4) cultivation is possible in the absence of terrestrial soil [21]. These types of microorganisms are used in various fields such as agriculture, food, medicine, and cosmetics [22]. In this sense, due to the energy, environmental, and economic crisis, microalgae biomass biorefineries represent a potential viable solution to this crisis. Therefore, one way to valorise the different sugarcane by-products is through the development of biorefineries to produce biochemicals and/or profitable biofuels [23]. Brazil is one of the pioneer countries in the biofuels market and its biorefinery infrastructure is a base for the implementation of various methodologies linked to large-scale biofuel production [24,25]. The term biorefinery encompasses networks of facilities that integrate different processes and equipment to transform biomass into biofuels, biomaterials, and biochemicals [26]. Biorefineries play an important role in industries because they can efficiently use resources, offer a solution to climate change, can reduce dependence on fossil fuels, and can meet energy needs [27]. The main obstacle when evaluating biorefineries projects is technical and economic feasibility; therefore, it is essential to address the integration of mass and energy flows through mathematical models for resource optimisation [23]. The optimisation of superstructures based on mathematical models provides a versatile array of configurations for a defined objective function [28]; thus, different conversion routes, multiple feedstocks, multiple periods, and the production of various biofuels can be included [29]. Another important aspect when evaluating the economic part of a biorefinery is to consider the environmental dimension and to analyse the supply chain. A supply chain is a network used to coordinate feedstock availability and product demand [30], and its proper design can provide a highly reliable and cost-effective system [31].

Several studies have evaluated the optimisation of superstructures using linear or mixed-integer nonlinear integer linear programming (MILP or MINLP) to integrate feed-stock streams, exploit waste, and produce a variety of biofuels and high-value products through the biorefinery concept. Varshney et al. [32] formulated an optimisation model for the production of bioethanol, pellets, and electricity from bagasse processing with the objectives of maximising net present value (NPV) and minimising greenhouse gas emissions and water footprint. Macowski et al. [33] developed a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to optimise the supply chain for the production of bioethanol from sugarcane to evaluate the environmental impact and economic value.

Gutierrez-Franco et al. [34] proposed the use of a multi-objective (economic, environmental and social) model (MILP) to design a sustainable supply chain for biofuels in Colombia from forest residues. Moretti et al. [35] formulated a model (MILP) to minimise the fuel production costs of a supply chain in Italy from 3 different feedstocks (wood chips, grape pomace, and olive pomace), 2 means of transportation (train and truck), and possible feedstock pre-processing. Gilani and Sahebi [36] proposed a model (MILP) of the supply chain for biofuel production from sugarcane with the objective of maximising profits from sales, minimising environmental impacts, and maximising supply chain employment. Basile et al. [37] applied an economic and environmental optimisation model for the design of a supply chain in Sweden for the production of biomethanol from forest residues. Vitale et al. [38] proposed a model for the supply chain in Argentina, using wood waste and forest residues as raw material for the production of wood pellets, with the objective of minimising the operating cost. Infante et al. [39] developed a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to minimise the carbon dioxide balance in the evaluation of a microalgae biorefinery, considering the production of various biofuels in Colombia. The results showed that producing diesel and green gasoline via hydrothermal liquefaction was the most favourable conversion pathway for minimising carbon dioxide emissions. Bagasse is also used as fuel for power and heat systems and as a pellet product. Loon et al. [40] studied a MILP model for the conversion of oil palm biomass into bio-based products and electricity. The results indicated that 0.2271 GWh/year of electricity and 0.0050636 Mtonnes of biofertilizers could be generated. Jabbarzadeh and Shamsi [41] proposed an optimisation model for the design and planning of a supply chain dedicated to bioethanol production from second- and third-generation biomass. Eslamipoor [42] discussed the importance of reducing carbon emissions in a sustainable supply chain (SSC) through carbon pricing. The results showed that a decentralised supply chain tends to be inefficient in terms of coordination, because the benefits are mainly concentrated to the retailer, while the producer barely covers its costs, without making a profit.

This study proposes the application of a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for the optimisation of biorefineries by studying the operating conditions of a supply chain that uses sugarcane vinasse as a microalgae culture medium for the production of sustainable aviation fuel and green diesel and gasoline in different states of Brazil. We analyse the model from both economic and environmental perspectives.

2. Materials and Methods

The optimisation of the superstructure consists of devising a mathematical formulation based on the biorefinery’s objectives. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model based on superstructure optimisation is developed for the production of SAF and green diesel and gasoline from an integrated microalgae biorefinery, using vinasse as the culture medium. The methodology used is based on three main steps. (1) We develop a superstructure of production processes steps, taking into account secondary data. (2) We formulate mathematical physical and economical models for mass and energy balance as well as the capital and operating costs associated with each model. (3) We solve the mathematical model to evaluate the objective function proposed.

The developed superstructure consists of different main processing steps/stages: (1) vinasse biodigestion, (2) microalgae cultivation in open ponds, (3) harvesting and dewatering, and (4) the conversion of microalgae biomass into final biofuels by hydrothermal liquefaction and upgrade. All of the above steps/stages are required for each constituent unit of the system being evaluated. Figure 1 shows a representation of all the steps/stages that make up the biorefinery.

Vinasse biodigestion: In order to calculate the available vinasse, we evaluated the ethanol production capacities of the states addressed in the study. For each litre of ethanol produced, 13.82 litres of vinasse are produced [43]. The produced vinasse is fed into an anaerobic biodigester to produce biogas, a compound mainly composed of methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen sulphide (H2S). Using the volume of vinasse produced in each state and the typical Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of the vinasse, the total COD load can be defined. Based on the removal efficiency of the UASB reactor (treatment method chosen for this study), the amount of COD removed can be calculated and the biogas flow rate of the system can be calculated. In this unit, biodigested vinasse not only produces biogas but also serves as a culture medium for microalgae. Key parameters include vinasse COD value = 33.25 kg/m3 [44]; UASB reactor efficiency = 62.5% [44,45]; CH4 percentage in biogas = 60%; and biogas production per COD removal = 0.234 m3/kg (in terms of CH4) [45].

Microalgae cultivation (open pond): Open-pond cultivation was chosen for the production of microalgae biomass in this study. We used biodigested diluted vinasse as the culture medium, with a reference vinasse concentration of 5% by volume. The amount of water lost through evaporation depends on factors like climate, temperature, and humidity. According to Guieysse et al. [46], water loss is approximately 0.476 m3/m2/year. The culture system presented a depth of 0.3 m and the system was assumed to be a high-rate algae pond (HRAP) with a constant concentration of 0.56 g/L during harvest periods and a hydraulic retention time of 8 days, corresponding to a biomass productivity of 70 mg/L-day (dry algae base without ash) [47]. The electricity consumption of the paddle wheel and pumps for the cultivation system is 2.7 kW/ha and 0.5 kW/ha, respectively [48].

Harvesting and dewatering: In this study, the harvesting and dewatering of the biomass were carried out in 3 processes: decantation, flocculation, and centrifugation. In the first process, excess water was removed to increase the algae concentration from 0.56 g/L to 20 g/L [49]. The efficiency of this unit was 95%. Subsequently, the microalgae biomass went through a chemical flocculation process to increase the algae concentration to 7.5% by weight. In a flocculation tank, 0.15 g/L of aluminium sulphate was added [50]. The biomass recovery in this process was 98% and the energy consumption was 0.15 kWh/m3 feed [51]. The biomass suspension after flocculation was concentrated by centrifugation at 200 g/L. The cell recovery efficiency was 99% [51].

Hydrothermal liquefaction: After the centrifugation process, the microalgae biomass with 20% solids is used in a hydrothermal liquefaction process for the production of SAF and green diesel and gasoline. During this unit, the main parameters are hydrogen consumption = 0.021 t H2/t dry microalgae; heat consumption = 0.59 MWh/t dry microalgae; electricity consumption = 0.035 MWh/t dry microalgae; gasoline production = 0.06 t gasoline/t dry microalgae; diesel production = 0.1287 t diesel/t dry microalgae; and SAF production = 0.0924 t SAF/t dry microalgae [52,53].

The biogas produced from the biodigestion of vinasse goes to a purification unit. The purification unit consists of a treatment process that upgrades and enriches the methane in the biogas to produce biomethane. In this study, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technology is employed to produce biomethane with 99% purity. The energy consumption of this unit is 0.31 kWh/Nm3 of biogas fed, with a CO2 removal efficiency of 99% and methane losses estimated at 3.5% [54].

For this study, the electricity supply is provided by the available electricity grid.

3. Structure, Formulation and Data of the Model

The optimisation model is a mixed linear programming problem (MILP) based on the superstructure shown in Figure 1. All processes considered in the superstructure are physical models based on the mass balance and energy of each technology, taking into account literature data and estimated data as previously mentioned. The superstructure was modelled as an MILP model and implemented in the LINGO v.20 software. Figure 2 shows a representation of the workflow of the optimisation superstructure. The mathematical model utilized during the case study uses [55,56] for reference.

3.1. Definition of Set

The formulation of the model considers different sets, to include and exclude different processes and parameters. Different main sets are worked on: resource (R), modal (M), location (L), and unit (U). The resource (R) elements are anything that can be transported as consumed resources, intermediates, and final products; the unit (U) elements are any technology that can transform one resource into another. For example, sugarcane vinasse can produce biogas through the biodigestion process. In this case, each element is inserted into the superstructure together with input flows (IARu,r) and output flows (OARu,r). The elements of the location (L) set represent the places with availability of raw material and/or demand, while the elements of the modal set represent the different modes of transport considered in the model.

3.2. Investment Cost Updating and Linearization

The investment cost is defined as the initial capital expenditure needed to build the biorefinery’s process units, with costs expressed on a per-process-unit basis. When calculating the required investment for plant and unit construction, data from the literature, where unit capacities are known, were used for reference. Since unit costs fluctuate over time, the cost values were adjusted using the Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index (CEPCI).

In the current study, exponent values of 0.6 were assumed for all units. Since each unit inserted into the superstructure has a reference scale, each capital investment cost at the reference scale must be adjusted. Therefore, a piecewise linearization of the capital cost function was performed for each process. To perform this linearization, the cost curve was obtained as a function of the scale variable (wu) when using Equation (1), where se is a scale exponent, Cu,p is the adjusted investment cost for the unit, and the investment cost at the reference scale is represented by C0u. The curve is then divided into different levels limited by a minimum and maximum value, CapMinu,l and CapMaxu,l, respectively. The coefficients of the linearized cost curve for each process are presented in the Supplementary Materials (Table S1).

C u = C 0 u w u se

(1)

3.3. Unit Selection and Scaling Adjustment

Selection and scaling for each unit element are performed using Equation (2), where CapMinu and CapMaxu are minimum and maximum parameters, representing the scaling that a unit can have, yu,p is a binary variable, representing the existence of that unit, and wu,p is a continuous variable responsible for unit scaling. When selected, a unit has a yu,p equal to one, and its wu,p is limited by CapMinu and CapMaxu. If not selected, the value zero is assumed, resulting in a wu,p equal to zero.

CapMin u y u , p ≤ w u , p ≤ CapMax u y u , p

(2)

When a unit is selected and scaled, one of the levels must also be selected. Only one level is chosen per unit at each location when using Equation (3). If a level is not selected, its binary variables (ylu,l) will have a value of zero, so the local scale factor variable wlu,l will also have a value of zero. As such, Equation (4) ensures that wu will be equal to the value of wlu,l of the selected level.

∑ l yl u , l ≤ 1

(3)

∑ l wl u , l = w u

(4)

3.4. Objective Function

The objective function of the superstructure is to minimise total costs, taking into account annualised investment, resource and transportation costs, and the sale of services, as shown in Equation (5).

M i n I N V C + O P E C + R M A C + T R N C − P R S C

(5)

Equation (6) was used to calculate the annualised investment cost (INVC), where au,l and bu,l represent the angular and linear coefficients of each linearized interval, respectively. The annualisation factor (AF) was set as 0.072.

INVC = ∑ l ( a u , l wl u , l + b u , l y u , l ) * AF

(6)

Equations (7)–(9) are used to calculate the operating cost (OPEC), raw material acquisition cost (RMAC), and product selling revenue (PRSC), respectively. The maintenance cost (MC) and other costs (OCs), which include operating supplies, administrative costs, overhead costs, taxes, and insurance costs, were set as 6% and 8.6% of the investment cost, respectively, based on [57]. The labour cost was set as 10% of the manufacturing cost, as in [58].

The parameters RCr and SPr represent the cost of resource r if bought and consumed as a raw material and the selling price of resource r if sold as a product, respectively.

RMAC = bought r RC r

(7)

PRSC = sold r SP r

(8)

OPEC = ∑ l ( a u , l wl u , l + b u , l y u , l ) * AF * ( MC + OC + LC )

(9)

The transportation cost (TRNC) is calculated using Equation (10), which considers the mass of the resource transported from location p’ to p, transfOutModalp’,p,r,mo, the distance transported, distp’p, and the modal cost to transport that resource, modCostr,mo.

T R N C = ∑ p ′ ∑ p ∑ r ∑ m o t r a n s f O u t M o d a l p ’ , p , r , mo * d i s t p ’ , p * m o d C o s t r , mo

(10)

3.5. Mass Balance

The methodology uses the concept of scaling, that is, each unit is a specific process where the input flow (IARu,r) and output flow (OARu,r) for each resource are relative to the specific scale; therefore, the scale of a unit can be expanded or reduced. In this case, a continuous variable (Wu,p) was used for each of these parameters, multiplying each of the input/output flows. In this way, the consumption (consu,r,p) and production (produ,r,p) of resources of that unit can be calculated. The calculation of the consumption (consu,r,p) and the production (produ,r,p) of resources of that unit at a given location is performed using Equations (11) and (12).

OAR u , r w u , p - prod u , r , p = 0

(11)

IAR u , r w u , p - cons u , r , p = 0

(12)

The mass balance, defined in Equation (13), applies to each resource (r) and location (p). Each resource produced or purchased at a location must either be consumed or sold, either locally or at another location. The balance is formed by six flows: consumption (consu,r,p), production (produ,r,p), purchase (boughtr,p), sale (soldr,p), input via transportation of resources from one location (p’) to another (p) (transfInr,p’,p), and output of resources via transportation from one location to another (transfOutr,p,p’). All factors depend on the number of hours for which the processes are operational, which is denoted by fop (8760 h).

bought r , p + ∑ u prod u , r , p fop + ∑ p ′ t r a n s f I n r , p ′ , p = ∑ u cons u , r , p fop + sold r , p + ∑ p ′ t r a n s f O u t r , p , p ′

(13)

3.6. Availability and Demand Constraints

Equations (14) and (15) are the availability and demand constraints, respectively, where availability and demand represent the available and demanded quantity of resource r, ensuring that each resource purchased is available and each resource sold is in demand.

bought r , p ≤ avail r , p

(14)

sold r , p ≤ demand r , p

(15)

3.7. Transport Restrictions

Equations (16)–(18) govern the transportation of resources between the locations included in the model. Equation (16) asserts that the mass of each resource entering the system and being transported to location p is the sum of the masses of that resource transported by the different modes considered. Equation (17) indicates that the mass of each resource leaving and being transported from location p to location p’ is the sum of that resource transported by the different modes considered. Equation (18) establishes that the mass of resource r leaving location p’ towards p via mode mo is equal to the mass that entered location p via mode mo, ensuring no losses due to transport.

t r a n s f I n r , p ’ , p = ∑ m o t r a n s f I n M o d a l r , p ’ , p , mo

(16)

t r a n s f O u t p , p ’ , r = ∑ m o t r a n s f O u t M o d a l p , p ’ , r , mo

(17)

t r a n s f O u t M o d a l p ’ , p , r , mo = t r a n s f I n M o d a l p ’ , p , r , mo

(18)

3.8. Transport Modal Unitary Cost

To calculate the transportation modal unitary costs of raw materials, intermediates, and final products, a simulation was performed based on data from the Brazilian National Land Transport Agency, taking into account different variables (vehicle configuration, type of load and distance) [59]. The main economic assumptions adopted for economic evaluation are presented in the Supplementary Materials (Table S2).

3.9. Economic Analysis

The economic calculations performed were discounted cash flow (Equation (19)), net present value (Equation (20)) and internal rate of return (Equation (21)).

D i s c o u n t e d c a s h f l o w i n y e a r t i m e = c a s h f l o w 1 + D i s c o u n t r a t e t i m e

(19)

N P V = ∑ D i s c o u n t e d c a s h f l o w i n y e a r t i m e − t o t a l i n v e s t m e n t

(20)

0 = ∑ c a s h f l o w t i m e 1 + I R R t i m e − t o t a l i n v e s t m e n t

(21)

where discount rate = 0.185 [60]; NPV = net present value; IRR = internal rate of return; and time = 20 years.

3.10. Emissions

Equation (22) demonstrates how the actual emission reduction can be quantified.

A c t u a l e m i s s i o n r e d u c t i o n = A E − R M A E − T E A E

(22)

where AE = avoided emissions; RMAE = raw material acquisition emissions; and TE = emitted by transport.

GHG Emission in Transportation

For the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions from the transport of resources, transport in diesel trucks was considered, which consumes 0.33 L/km. The emissions from the transportation of resources are presented in the Supplementary Materials (Table S3). Table S4 in the Supplementary Materials presents reference values for CO2 emissions and emissions avoidance.

4. Case Study

Currently, Brazil is the largest producer and exporter of sugarcane in the world. In addition, Brazil is the world’s leading producer of ethanol, using sugarcane as feedstock. This means that the estimated production of vinasse in Brazil is 336 to 504 GL/year [13]. To evaluate the proposed optimisation model, a case study in Brazil was selected, taking into account the ethanol production capacity. The nine Brazilian states with the highest ethanol production capacity were studied and subsequently the vinasse production was calculated. The calculation of vinasse production was made based on the study by [43], where, for each litre of ethanol, 13.82 litres of vinasse are produced. For the production of sugarcane in Alagoas, Paraíba, and Pernambuco, a production of 180 d/year was assumed, while in the other states the production was 210 d/year. Table 1 shows the potential of each selected state.

Jet fuel demand replaced aviation fuel consumption at each state’s main airport. The demand for aviation fuel for each state was calculated from the consumption of jet fuel in each state in the year 2023. Aviation fuel demand at each airport is found in Table 2.

5. Results and Analysis

In this study, with the solution of the objective function for each state, it was possible to calculate the quantity of biofuels produced, as shown in Table 3.

The objective function for all the analysed states yields negative solutions, i.e., profits are produced at the evaluated processing scale.

Figure 3 shows the costs for the different states analysed. The states of Paraíba and Pernambuco have the highest costs associated with investment as a percentage of total costs, while Mato Grosso is the state with the lowest investment costs as a percentage, but it has the highest proportion of transportation costs (and this is because the distances between regions with availability of vinasse and the demand for biofuels are greater than in the other states in the case study).

This suggests that logistics costs are a significant challenge, perhaps due to the geographic location or transportation infrastructure in this region. Regarding resource costs, hydrogen purchase costs account for approximately 57% of raw material costs, followed by electricity purchase costs at 27%.

Table 4 shows the economic results for the entire supply chain. As can be seen in Table 4, São Paulo is the most profitable state, with a cash flow of 1071.09 and an IRR of 36.19%, far outperforming the rest. Its NPV of 2641.78 stands out as the highest, indicating a significant net return on the initial investment of 2953.66. Its discounted payback of 4.22 years is the fastest, reflecting an accelerated rate of the recovery of capital. This is because the state of São Paulo is by far the largest generator of vinasse of the states analysed in this study, with 509.7 Mtonnes, representing approximately 46% of the total. Its production far exceeds that of the state with the second largest volume, Goiás, which generates 170.8 million, i.e., São Paulo produces almost three times more vinasse than Goiás. Compared to other relevant states such as Mato Grosso (110.2 million), Mato Grosso do Sul (107.1 million), and Minas Gerais (107.5 million), São Paulo generates almost five times more vinasse. If contrasted with northeast states such as Paraíba (12.5 million) or Pernambuco (14.1 million), the difference is even more marked: São Paulo produces more than 40 times the amount of vinasse of these states. The states of Paraíba and Pernambuco do not meet the profitability criteria; this is because the IRR is lower than the opportunity cost. Both have IRRs lower than the expected threshold for investments (18.5%); in addition, they show a negative NPV, that is, the return does not compensate the initial costs. Even discounting future income, they have the lowest cash flows, which significantly reduces their ability to generate value. The states of Goiás and Minas Gerais have payback periods of 5.10 and 5.45 years, respectively, while states such as Paraná and Mato Grosso have slower discounted payback periods, but are still viable. The production cost ranges between 0.009 and 0.011 (MUS$/TJ biofuel) for different states. Hayward et al. [63] evaluated the feasibility and cost of producing jet fuels using lignocellulosic biomass; the results showed that the estimated cost of biomass-based jet fuels ranges from $0.70 to $1.90 per litter. In another study, Wang [64] assessed the economics of various feedstocks for jet fuel production in Taiwan, with results indicating a minimum selling price for jet fuel ranging from $0.91 to $2.73 per litter.

The values for avoided CO2 emissions, Raw Material Acquisition (RMA) emissions, and transport emissions for the studied configurations are provided in Table 5. Transport emissions from the services range from 0.6% (Alagoas) to 8.6% (Mato Grosso) of total emissions. The actual reduction in emissions for the different states is approximately 98.4%.

In 2024, the estimated carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq) emissions for domestic and international flights in Brazil amounted to 14,236,728.9 tonnes [65]. In parallel, emissions avoided by aviation fuel amounted to 2,535,575 tonnes of CO2 eq. When analysing the relationship between avoided and generated emissions, an approximate value of 0.178 is obtained. This means that our actions contributed to reducing the total emissions generated by the air sector in Brazil by 17.8%. This positive impact reflects a significant advance towards the decarbonisation of a highly emitting sector such as aviation, highlighting the importance of implementing effective climate change mitigation strategies. The emissions avoided by the biofuels produced were 15,398,086.51 tonnes of CO2 eq, representing a net positive impact of 1,161,357.61 tonnes of CO2 eq avoided beyond the emissions from the air sector. This means that, for each estimated tonnes of CO2 emissions from domestic and international flights in Brazil in 2024, the actions implemented avoided an additional 1.08 tonnes of CO2 eq.

Brazil’s new Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) aims to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 59% to 67% by 2035 compared to 2005, reaching a range of 850 million to 1050 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent [66]. To achieve this, Brazil must avoid between 1223 million and 2132 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2035. As mentioned above, the emissions avoided by the biofuels produced were 15,398,086.51 tonnes of CO2 eq, representing between 0.72% and 1.26% of Brazil’s total net emissions reduction target for 2035.

Sensitivity analysis was employed to examine and evaluate the impact of variations in model parameters on the discounted payback. All states were simulated again for different electricity prices—50, 60, and 30 USD/MWh; different hydrogen prices—3000, 4000 and 6000 USD/ton; and different discount rates—10, 15 and 20%. The results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6.

With the variation in the price of electricity, the states of Paraíba and Pernambuco continue to present negative NPVs. With a value of 80 USD/MWh, the model does not activate any distillery in Paraíba, and so this parameter has a great influence on the model for these two states (Specific incentives and differentiated energy rates are needed to improve profitability in less competitive states, such as Paraíba and Pernambuco, which have negative NPVs under less favourable scenarios). As the price of electricity decreases, the payback decreases for all states, except for Mato Grosso, with a value of 60 USD/MWh. This is because the transport cost decreases by 29% and biofuel production (gasoline, diesel, biomethane and aviation fuel) is reduced by 13%. When the electricity price is 50 USD/MWh, the discounted payback decreases by between 6 and 19% with respect to the base case, while when the electricity price is 80 USD/MWh, the discounted payback increases by between 2 and 10% with respect to the base case (Figure 4).

Figure 5 shows the discounted payback trend with the variation in the hydrogen price. For a price of 3000 USD/ton, the states of Paraíba and Pernambuco show a discounted payback of 11.66 and 14.46 years, respectively; for the values of 4000 and 6000 USD/ton, the two states indicate a negative NPV, and so the investment is not viable. As the price of hydrogen decreases, the discounted payback decreases for all states. When the hydrogen price is USD 3000/ton, the discounted payback decreases by 19–30% with respect to the base case, while when the hydrogen price is USD 6000/ton, the discounted payback increases by 3–35% with respect to the base case.

The decline in hydrogen and electricity prices has led to a strategy of reducing the payback period, suggesting that policies supporting domestic green hydrogen production and renewable energy generation could have immediate positive effects on the sector’s profitability.

Figure 6 shows the trend of the discounted payback with the variation in the discount rate. When the discount rate is 10%, the discounted payback decreases between 19 and 41% with respect to the base case, while when the discount rate is 20%, the discounted payback increases between 5 and 21% with respect to the base case. For a discount rate of 10%, the states of Paraíba and Pernambuco show a discounted payback of 11.59 and 9.13 years, respectively; for the values of 15 and 20%, the state of Paraíba indicates a negative NPV, so the investment is not viable. For a 15% the discount rate, the discounted payback in the state of Pernambuco is 14.68 which represents an increase of 61% with respect to a discount rate of 10%. The sensitivity to the discount rate suggests that the financial context and access to credit or subsidies will also be decisive in encouraging new investments in the biofuel sector.

6. Conclusions

In this study, we propose an MILP model for a biorefinery that uses sugarcane vinasse as a medium for microalgae cultivation to achieve the production of green gasoline, green diesel, aviation fuel, and biomethane. The case study model focuses on different states in Brazil. The model’s objective function aimed to minimise the system’s total cost. The states of Goiás and Mato Grosso satisfy the aviation fuel demand in full, while Alagoas, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraíba, Pernambuco Paraná, and São Paulo satisfy the aviation fuel demand by 36.46%, 66.35%, 99.66%, 18.29, 5.10%, 63,02%, and 13%, respectively. The states of Paraíba and Pernambuco have negative NPVs, meaning that, for these two states, the project may not be financially viable after 20 years, while the state of São Paulo has the lowest discounted payback. Transportation-related emissions of energy produced in biorefineries represent 0.6–8.6% of the modelled total emissions, underscoring the critical role of biorefinery location and logistics infrastructure. The proposed model demonstrates clear alignment with the climate goals established in Brazil’s NDC, with an average emissions reduction of 98.4% across the assessed states and the ability to avoid 15.4 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. This impact represents between 0.72% and 1.26% of Brazil’s total net emissions reduction target for 2035, as established in its new NDC, reinforcing the model’s relevance as a viable tool that can contribute to meeting the country’s international commitments regarding climate change. Regarding resource costs, hydrogen purchase costs account for approximately 57% of raw material costs, followed by electricity purchase costs at 27%. The sensitivity analysis shows that the price of electricity has a high influence on the model. Overall, the model stands out for its real applicability, providing a strategic tool to guide investment decisions and public policies in the sustainable energy transition.

Hi, everyone. Look at this truck right behind me. It's carrying sustainable aviation fuel or SAF as we like to call it, and it's being used right now to fuel our aircraft. So here's the thing, SAFE isn't something for the future. It's really available today. In fact, in 2024, we've already used 18% SEF across our operations and that includes in our flight tests and our Beluga operations. So it's real. And it's happening and it shows that we can really make a difference today. But here's the challenge. We need to go further. We need more surf at affordable prices to have more and more adoption. And so we need to push forward for the industry to reach our goals together. So here we have it. We've got the aircraft technology, we have the fuel technology, and we have a common goal. So let's make SAF the new normal because the time to. Connect is really narrow. Let's do this.

Canada H2 sees opening as political chaos engulfs US

Canada H2 sees opening as political chaos engulfs US

Houston, 25 April (Argus) — Canada's hydrogen sector sees an opportunity to attract global customers as the US' bellicose stance toward its northern neighbor unites Canadians behind strengthening its energy capacity and as US political turmoil sends countries looking for other trading partners. ""The mayhem south of the border has created a real national interest in exports,"" Trigon Pacific Terminals chief executive Robert Booker said this week at the Canadian Hydrogen Convention in Edmonton, Alberta. Trigon is building a berth at the port in Prince Rupert, British Columbia, to handle low-carbon hydrogen converted to ammonia. ""The choice, quite frankly, is become the 51st state or export,"" Booker said. ""We should export, and there's broad understanding that that's good for Canada."" Canadian energy exports from Alberta have largely gone south to the US. Ambitions to tap global markets have been stymied in years past by community and federal opposition to building rail and pipeline infrastructure that would connect the landlocked province to the Pacific coast. Multiple large-scale hydrogen proposals in western Canada were quietly shelved in the past year because of a lack of infrastructure, among other challenges, and Canadian companies were shut out of recent Asian auctions to buy hydrogen because of similar restraints. But Trump's return to the White House has changed Canadians' views on export infrastructure. Both candidates in the upcoming 28 April general election, including Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney who served as UN Special Envoy for Climate Action, have vowed to build out pipelines , rail corridors and other infrastructure — including electricity grids — to diversify energy exports away from the US. ""We've never been this united in the country,"" said Julie Lemieux, chief executive officer of Triple Point Resources, which is developing a salt dome in Newfoundland for hydrogen storage. ""That's the positive of the chaos. We've been notoriously slow to approve these projects and invest in infrastructure. Whoever wins next week, they've all committed to investing in infrastructure."" Panelists speaking in Edmonton expressed relief that Canada didn't follow the US example of putting tariffs on China, whose technology and components will be instrumental to containing costs while building Canadian infrastructure. ""For better or worse, whatever your opinion, the build out of new infrastructure today is really dependent on China, especially when it comes to green infrastructure, where there's already an embedded green premium,"" said Matthew Borys, vice president of corporate development at EverWind Fuels. ""Keeping the cost down is super important to getting these things built out."" The Trump administration's preference for fossil fuel extraction over clean energy and its expansionist designs on the Panama Canal are also seen as opportunities for Canadian developers to attract Asian customers who could avoid the canal by exporting from British Columbia terminals, said James Vultaggio, vice president of Atco EnPower. ""The administration to the south is focused more on fossil fuel production and reducing environmental regulations,"" Vultaggio said. ""If they want to cede their seat as a clean energy leader, then Canada has an opportunity to fill that seat, and we should take it."" Trump has been outspoken in his preference for fossil fuel extraction and has paused all federal clean energy disbursements related to the Inflation Reduction Act, which has raised doubts about whether US hydrogen hubs can survive as they were initially conceived during the administration of former president Joe Biden. Clean energy incentives such as the 45V hydrogen production tax credit have also come under scrutiny as the Trump administration seeks to shrink government spending. The uncertainty around clean energy incentives in the US may well send American investment north, said Denis Caron, chief executive of the Belledune Port Authority in eastern Canada's New Brunswick province, which is positioning itself as a green energy hub targeting European markets. Caron said an American company working with the port of Belledune remains bullish on its prospects there and could serve as a model to attract even more American investment if the US continues to claw back support for clean energy. ""We see an opportunity to attract American investment to Canada and make those types of investments,"" Caron said. ""Canada has a golden opportunity to fulfill the requirement of supplying clean and green energy products globally.""

The BMW Group is driving the future of emission-free heavy-duty transport – with pilot operations of the first hydrogen trucks now underway at Plant Leipzig as part of the H2Haul project. Demonstrating its openness to different technologies once again – including in logistics – the BMW Group’s involvement is one component of its more comprehensive hydrogen strategy connecting transport, production and products.

A MILESTONE IN EMISSION-FREE HEAVY-DUTY TRANSPORT.

The BMW Group is taking the next step towards sustainable transport logistics: two local emission-free fuel-cell trucks are now entering pilot operations. Part of the European H2Haul project supporting hydrogen-powered freight transport, the trucks will travel between Leipzig, Landsberg and Nuremberg to see how their drive technology performs in everyday operations. In addition, state-of-the-art hydrogen filling stations are currently under construction at Leipzig and Hormersdorf (northeast of Nuremberg) to offer the fast refuelling necessary for truck operations to succeed. The project is being realised by the BMW Group in conjunction with Iveco, DHL and TEAL mobility.

Michael Nikolaides, head of Production Network and Logistics at the BMW Group, says:

The right choice of transport is important in global logistics, as elsewhere, to keep us future-focused and efficient in our work.

“So, transport logistics is another area reflecting the BMW Group’s open-minded approach to technologies. For the first time, hydrogen-powered trucks will support series production in German car manufacturing. We have been working on the project for a number of years now and are rolling out this pilot fleet in collaboration with our partners. It’s an important milestone as it will give us experience of how these trucks work in series operations and help us continue enhancing this crucial technology,”

H2Haul: TWO OF THE 16 SUBSIDISED TRUCKS ARE ON THE ROAD FOR BMW GROUP LOGISTICS.

The H2Haul project looks at how hydrogen fuel cell-powered trucks perform in real-world driving and what they can contribute to fossil fuel-free heavy-duty transport. All in all, 16 vehicles are involved, subsidised by the Clean Hydrogen Partnership and operating across Europe. Of those, two are IVECO S-eWay Fuel Cell trucks on the road for the BMW Group. Findings from the pilot project are expected to help enhance the technology and get it market-ready. A valuable addition to the battery-electric trucks already on the road, the hydrogen vehicles are quick to refuel and offer significant range. They are also flexible to use as they are independent of the charging infrastructure or grid development.

A CLEAR STRATEGY FOR EMISSION-FREE LOGISTICS AT THE BMW GROUP.

The BMW Group’s participation in the H2Haul project is a key cornerstone in its Reduced Logistics Emissions Strategy. This aims to achieve emission-free transport logistics, with a dedicated cross-departmental team developing measures to reduce CO₂ from the BMW Group’s road, rail and shipping transport worldwide. Drive technologies receiving a positive rating are advanced into pilot projects and new plant concepts, whose emissions data is then systematically recoded to enable accurate CO₂ reporting.

FueL CELL AND COMBUSTION ENGINE COMPARED.

Fuel cell technology is not all the BMW Group is testing: it is also involved in the HyCET (Hydrogen Combustion Engine Trucks) project. In the future, this will see two 40-tonne and one 18-tonne truck powered by hydrogen combustion engines join its logistics fleet. Funded by the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV), the HyCET project is being implemented by the BMW Group in conjunction with DHL, Volvo Trucks, Deutz, KEYOU and TotalEnergies.

By testing H₂ fuel cells and combustion engines simultaneously, the BMW Group is remaining true to its open-minded approach to technologies – including in logistics. While fuel cells work more efficiently, combustion engines are cheaper to produce as they essentially work on the same tried-and-tested principle as a diesel. The EU ordinance classes both hydrogen technologies as zero-emissions, and out on the road they are both being trialled on the same routes and refuelling at the same filling stations. The aim is to determine the best use case for each technology in BMW Group logistics.

HYDROGEN AS A DRIVER OF PLANT LOGISTICS.

Heavy-duty transport is not the only area where the BMW Group uses hydrogen: it also uses it within its own plants. Plant Leipzig is considered a pioneer in this regard, being home to the first indoor hydrogen filling station in Germany since way back in 2013. Today it operates five such facilities as well as one of the largest fleets of fuel cell-powered forklifts and tug trains in Europe. The latest filling station even offers fully automated refuelling – another first!

FLEXIBLE HYDROGEN BURNERS FOR CLEANER PAINTING.

Innovative solutions are a defining feature in production too, where the BMW Group is the first carmaker in the world to roll out a brand-new type of burner, now on stream in Plant Leipzig. The new bivalent system can be powered by gas as well as hydrogen, and there are currently five such burners operating in contrast roof painting for the MINI Countryman. Further burners are currently being converted for hydrogen, with the longer-term aim of doing away with gas power completely and reducing CO2 emissions further.

Petra Peterhänsel, Plant Director at BMW Group Plant Leipzig, taking a longer view of the plant’s overall direction for the future, explains:

Our vision at Plant Leipzig is to largely decarbonise production. We can achieve that, in part, by replacing fossil fuels with hydrogen,

FIRST HYDROGEN-POWERED PRODUCTION BMW DUE IN 2028.

Beyond logistics and production, hydrogen also plays an important role in vehicle development. After successful testing in a pilot fleet, the BMW iX5 Hydrogen is about to embark on the next step in its development, with an existing model due for launch as a fuel cell vehicle (FCEV) in 2028. Complementing the portfolio of battery-electric (BEV), plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, the hydrogen model will offer a further solution for electromobility and yet another local emission-free drive option for BMW Group customers to choose from.

Earlier in his speech, Nik Nazmi called the project a “game-changer” for Malaysia’s energy and aviation sectors, noting its alignment with the country’s climate goals under the Paris Agreement.
This refinery will help decarbonise the aviation sector while enhancing our energy security and supporting Malaysia’s net-zero aspirations,” he said.","Partnership with UAE poised to transform aviation sector, operational by 2029

KUALA LUMPUR: Airlines will have greater access to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with the setting up of a state-of-the-art refinery in Port Klang, a US$500mil (RM2.19bil) collaboration between UAE-based Bin Zayed International Group (BZI) and Malaysia’s FatHopes Energy (FHE).

The two firms announced that the facility – among the first of its kind in South-East Asia – will be one of the world’s most forward-looking SAF refineries.

It is expected to transform the regional clean aviation landscape by producing SAF via the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids pathway, which currently accounts for over 80% of global SAF production.

According to BZI (Malaysia) Berhad managing director Datuk Seri Dr Shamir Kumar Nandy, the project is slated to break ground in 2026 and begin commercial operations by 2029.

“We are underwriting the entire sum for now by ourselves. Based on FatHopes’ findings and updates, they’re in the process of getting the necessary approvals and sanctions before they can break ground.

“So I believe that will be a year down the road – about 12 months from today,” he said at a press conference here yesterday.

Also present at the announcement was Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability Minister Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad.

Shamir said the partnership combines BZI’s global investment expertise and FHE’s leadership in sustainable biofuel feedstock aggregation, laying the groundwork for a highly diversified and scalable SAF platform in the region.

He added that the Port Klang refinery is a key element in Malaysia’s ambition to produce one million tonnes of SAF annually, solidifying the nation’s role in the global SAF economy.

“This initiative has the potential to reimagine the future of flight,” said Shamir.

“It’s about profit, people and the planet – but most importantly, it’s for the planet,” he added.

FHE chief executive officer Vinesh Sinha said the project, currently in the feasibility stage, will have a production capacity of 300,000 tonnes per annum, requiring roughly 330,000 tonnes of feedstock.

He noted the technology in use can process various feedstocks, guided by prevailing policies and certifications.

While BZI has fully committed to the financing, Vinesh highlighted that the primary challenges in the refinery’s development are technical in nature.

“There’s a lot of input materials we need – hydrogen and nitrogen, which are major components of the manufacturing process.

“We are in the midst of identifying sources for those. Then there’s the port infrastructure, which is also a key factor.

“On our end, we are really focused on technical readiness and securing environmental impact assessment clearance for this particular plant,” Vinesh added.

Earlier in his speech, Nik Nazmi called the project a “game-changer” for Malaysia’s energy and aviation sectors, noting its alignment with the country’s climate goals under the Paris Agreement.

“Air travel is essential, but it must become sustainable. This refinery will help decarbonise the aviation sector while enhancing our energy security and supporting Malaysia’s net-zero aspirations,” he said.

Nik Nazmi also highlighted the project’s socio-economic value, saying it will create jobs and benefit communities involved in the biofuel supply chain.

“This project shows that sustainability and economic opportunity can go hand in hand.”",https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/04/26/3284823.JPG,N,,2025-04-25 19:56:17.725045

DENVER, April 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Boom Supersonic, the company building the world's fastest airliner, Overture, today announced that it has selected a site at the Colorado Air and Space Port in Watkins, CO to conduct engine tests for its Symphony propulsion system. The site was previously used for hypersonic engine development. Symphony, the bespoke engine for Overture, is a medium bypass turbofan optimized for supersonic flight. Boom is investing $3-5 million into the site this year to prepare it for supersonic engine testing, slated to start later this year.

""Symphony is rapidly advancing from concept to reality. By leveraging an existing site, Boom will have the first independently-owned supersonic engine test facility for less than it would have cost to rent a government facility,"" said Blake Scholl, Founder and CEO of Boom Supersonic. ""By vertically integrating propulsion, we are able to accelerate development, reduce costs, and custom-tailor an engine for Overture—unlocking capabilities like Boomless Cruise.""

The Symphony engine test facility, located in Adams County only 35 miles from Boom's headquarters, will support this year's test of Symphony's prototype core. Measuring 12 feet long and 4 feet in diameter, the core is the high pressure spool of the engine, consisting of the compressor, combustor, and turbine—the most critical components of the first independently-developed supersonic jet engine.

""This is an exciting moment not just for Adams County, but for the future of aerospace innovation in Colorado,"" said Lynn Baca, Chair of the Adams County Board of Commissioners. ""Boom's investment in our community puts us at the forefront of the aerospace industry and reflects our shared commitment to advancing next-generation transportation technologies.""

The facility at the Colorado Air and Space Port includes a control room and advanced instrumentation. Data collected from Symphony core tests will allow Boom to refine engineering and manufacturing design for Symphony. Boom expects to expand the site in 2026 to facilitate full-scale testing of the entire Symphony turbofan prototype.

""We are very excited to welcome Boom Supersonic to the Colorado Air and Space Port and to support the development of its revolutionary Symphony engine,"" said Jeff Kloska, Director of the Colorado Air and Space Port (CASP). ""We look forward to a great partnership with Boom and to advancing our aviation and aerospace ecosystem at CASP.""

The Symphony engine continues to progress rapidly. In March, Symphony passed a key technical review—enabling the manufacturing launch. Multiple parts have already entered the manufacturing phase and engine assembly will start later this year. When the Symphony program moves into production, Boom will leverage the skilled team and facility at StandardAero in San Antonio, TX to build Symphony engines at rate.

Purpose-building and vertically integrating Symphony enables Boom to unlock additional capabilities for Overture, including flying at supersonic speeds without an audible sonic boom on the ground with Boomless Cruise. Symphony features enhanced transonic performance compared to commercially-derived engines, allowing Overture to efficiently accelerate to supersonic speeds at altitudes above 30,000 feet—where Boomless Cruise is possible.

In February, Boom's XB-1 demonstrator broke the sound barrier six times without creating a sonic boom that was heard on the ground, opening the door to supersonic flight over land onboard Overture with Boomless Cruise. Overture has 130 orders and pre-orders from United Airlines, American Airlines, and Japan Airlines, representing the first five years of production at its Overture Superfactory in Greensboro, North Carolina.

The aviation industry is undergoing a technological renaissance, and at the heart of it is JetZero’s Blended Wing Body Z4 aircraft—a futuristic design that has captured the attention of major global airlines as of April 2025. Unlike conventional aircraft, the Z4’s blended wing body merges the fuselage and wings into a single aerodynamic surface, promising dramatic gains in fuel efficiency, emissions reduction, and operational flexibility. As environmental regulations tighten and fuel costs soar, leading carriers are racing to align with next-generation solutions, and JetZero’s Z4 appears to be leading the pack.

United Airlines has emerged as the most prominent early backer, committing to a conditional purchase agreement for up to 200 Z4 aircraft. This deal hinges on successful demonstrations of the aircraft’s airworthiness, operational viability, and regulatory approval. Delta Air Lines is also onboard, contributing operational insight to the Z4’s development in a strategic effort to modernize its long-haul fleet. Alaska Airlines, through its sustainability-focused Alaska Star Ventures program, has taken a financial stake in JetZero, viewing the Z4 as a cornerstone in achieving its net-zero ambitions. Meanwhile, European low-cost carrier easyJet is exploring the possibility of integrating hydrogen-powered technology into JetZero’s platform, aiming to leap ahead in zero-emission travel.

The breadth of collaboration—from full investments to technical partnerships—shows that JetZero’s Z4 is more than just an experimental aircraft. It’s rapidly becoming a benchmark for the aviation industry’s green future, redefining what commercial flight can look like in a world increasingly shaped by climate and innovation imperatives.

It’s no coincidence that United Airlines joins with Boom Supersonic, American, Japan, Virgin Atlantic at this critical moment, all united behind JetZero’s Blended Wing Body Z Four aircraft, an engineering marvel expected to cut fuel by fifty percent. If these projections are met, the Z Four could redefine sustainable transatlantic travel by 2030—with environmental, commercial, and passenger benefits like never before.

In a move that signals the dawn of a radical new era in commercial aviation, United Airlines has announced a groundbreaking investment in JetZero, a California-based startup developing the Z4 aircraft, a next-generation blended wing body (BWB) jet that could dramatically reshape the future of long-haul travel. If successful, the Z4 aircraft could reduce fuel consumption by up to 50%, significantly cut emissions, and redefine passenger experience on transatlantic routes.

The news follows United’s previous investment in Boom Supersonic’s Overture, reaffirming the airline’s strategy to position itself at the cutting edge of aviation innovation. The Chicago-based carrier’s latest bet—on a futuristic airframe design that blends the fuselage and wings into one continuous lifting surface—is among the boldest yet.

The Investment: A 200-Aircraft Vision

United Airlines Ventures, the airline’s corporate venture fund, has committed to an initial order of 100 JetZero Z4 aircraft, with an option for 100 more. While the financial terms remain undisclosed, the partnership is conditional on JetZero achieving critical developmental milestones, most notably a full-scale demonstrator flight by 2027 and full compliance with United’s safety and operational standards.

If the Z4 proves successful, it could be a game-changer—not only for United but for the entire aviation sector. It aligns directly with the carrier’s net-zero emissions goals by 2050 and enhances its leadership role in advancing cleaner, smarter flying.

What Is the Blended Wing Body?

Unlike traditional tube-and-wing jets, the blended wing body design merges the fuselage with the wings into a wide, flat, lifting structure. This configuration drastically reduces aerodynamic drag and improves lift-to-drag ratio, making it a more fuel-efficient option for long-haul routes.

The JetZero Z4 is expected to carry up to 250 passengers and operate using conventional jet fuel, but it will be fully compatible with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blends—key to future-proofing aircraft as the industry transitions toward greener alternatives.

NASA has long championed the BWB concept for its aerodynamic efficiency and is actively supporting JetZero alongside the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to meet certification and integration requirements ahead of the 2030 launch window.

Geo-Targeted Potential: United’s Transatlantic Footprint

United’s existing hubs in Chicago, Newark, Washington D.C., Houston, and San Francisco could serve as key bases for early Z4 operations, especially on transatlantic routes to London, Frankfurt, Paris, and Amsterdam—markets where long-haul efficiency matters most.

With the Z4 capable of reducing fuel use on such routes by up to 45%, United stands to gain operational flexibility, reduce carbon emissions, and offer a more environmentally conscious product to leisure and corporate travelers alike.

The aircraft is also touted to be compatible with existing airport infrastructure, alleviating concerns over the size and shape of the fuselage disrupting terminal logistics or gate compatibility.

Passenger Comfort Meets Efficiency

Beyond efficiency, the Z4’s interior promises a roomier, more comfortable cabin. With the blended wing layout, designers have greater flexibility in seating configurations, cabin layout, and even natural lighting solutions. The result? An upgraded customer experience that competes not only on sustainability, but also on comfort.

Andrew Chang, head of United Airlines Ventures, noted: “JetZero has the potential to evolve our core mainline business by developing aircraft with a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers while increasing fuel efficiency.”

This shift aligns with passenger demand for more spacious and quieter cabins, especially as business and leisure travelers expect airlines to deliver not just speed and savings, but enhanced in-flight well-being.

Why United Is Betting Big on Aviation Reinvention

United’s strategy of targeted innovation is increasingly centered around transformative aviation technologies. By investing in both speed (Boom’s Overture) and efficiency (JetZero’s Z4), the airline is preparing for a diversified future. It recognizes that one size doesn’t fit all—different markets require different tools, and the key to success lies in flexibility.

The Z4 investment also shows United’s intent to not merely adopt green technologies, but actively shape them. By partnering at the development stage, United ensures its operational needs are baked into the aircraft’s DNA—from fuel compatibility to cabin layout, airport integration, and maintenance protocols.

What Comes Next?

JetZero must now navigate a series of high-stakes development stages, including aerodynamic testing, full-scale prototyping, and FAA certification. The company has strong momentum, having already secured technical support from NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center.

If all goes to plan, the first Z4 could enter commercial service by 2030—just in time for airlines to meet the ICAO’s CORSIA emission standards and consumer expectations for more sustainable travel.

By making this early commitment, United not only secures a place at the front of the line but also signals to regulators and investors that BWB is no longer science fiction—it’s an emerging reality.

The Supersonic Jet Revival: A New Era in Passenger Travel

The dream of supersonic travel once soared high in the skies, quite literally, through the revolutionary Concorde—a marvel of aviation engineering that promised unmatched speed and status. From 1976 to 2003, the Concorde captivated the imagination of the world, shrinking the New York to London flight time to just over three hours. But despite its prestige, the Concorde’s retirement marked the end of an era, burdened by immense fuel consumption, deafening sonic booms, and unsustainable operating costs. Now, two decades later, the idea of supersonic passenger travel is not only being revived—it’s being redefined.

Today’s supersonic renaissance is fueled by a unique blend of innovation, urgency, and opportunity. Climate change has forced the aviation industry to reimagine what flight efficiency means, while technology has matured to the point where noise, emissions, and even cost challenges are beginning to seem surmountable. At the center of this modern movement is Boom Supersonic, a U.S.-based company that has captured attention with its Overture aircraft—an ambitious jet designed to travel at Mach 1.7 and carry up to 80 passengers.

Boom’s progress has been significant, and the aviation industry has taken notice. Major carriers like United Airlines, American Airlines, and Japan Airlines have placed pre-orders for the Overture, signaling their confidence in the commercial potential of supersonic travel. These aren’t just experimental partnerships; they represent a shift in how legacy airlines view their future. The goal is no longer just faster travel but smarter, more efficient, and more sustainable air mobility.

Unlike the Concorde, which operated with a niche clientele, Boom aims to democratize supersonic travel—at least to the level of current business class offerings. The company has stated it intends to keep ticket prices competitive, potentially around $5,000 round-trip for transatlantic journeys. If successful, this could open the door for a new class of premium flyers—those who value both time and environmental responsibility.

But challenges remain. One of the most pressing is the issue of sonic booms. The harsh crack of an aircraft breaking the sound barrier was a major reason Concorde was restricted from overland routes, limiting its commercial flexibility. To tackle this, new supersonic jet developers are focusing on low-boom or boomless designs. NASA and other aerospace leaders are contributing research into how to reduce noise signatures without compromising speed.

Fuel is another critical factor. The aviation industry is under increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, and supersonic jets, by nature of their high speeds, require more energy. Boom Supersonic has committed to running its aircraft entirely on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80%. While this helps with emissions, questions about SAF supply, scalability, and cost remain in the spotlight.

In addition to Boom, other companies such as Spike Aerospace and Exosonic are developing their own versions of quiet, efficient supersonic aircraft. Their goals align with industry-wide trends: faster point-to-point travel, low noise impact, and strong environmental credentials. Even NASA’s X-59 QueSST project—short for Quiet Supersonic Technology—is focused on delivering data that could one day help overturn the FAA’s longstanding ban on civilian supersonic flight over land.

The renewed interest in supersonic flight also coincides with a broader transformation in the aviation sector. Air mobility is being pushed to evolve—not just in speed but in sustainability, digital connectivity, and passenger experience. Airlines are looking to differentiate themselves in a post-pandemic travel economy that prizes convenience, safety, and innovation. Supersonic travel fits neatly into this narrative. It not only satisfies the demand for shorter travel times but also serves as a symbol of progress—a futuristic solution that could inspire confidence and loyalty in increasingly climate-conscious consumers.

Of course, regulatory hurdles still need to be addressed. Air traffic management systems will need to adapt to faster flight corridors. Infrastructure such as airports and fueling stations must also evolve to accommodate new aircraft types and SAF requirements. But these are not insurmountable obstacles. They are challenges typical of any transformative leap in aviation history—and ones that many stakeholders, from manufacturers to regulators, are actively working to overcome.

Supersonic jets may not be carrying average economy passengers anytime soon, but their revival marks a powerful step forward for commercial flight. It’s not just about breaking the sound barrier again—it’s about breaking the industry’s stagnation in speed and innovation. If aircraft like Boom’s Overture deliver on their promises by the early 2030s, the golden age of high-speed travel may finally return—not as a luxury for the few, but as a viable option for the many who demand speed, sustainability, and sophistication.

The supersonic future is not just coming—it’s accelerating. And this time, it might just be built to last.

A Winged Leap Into Aviation’s Future

United Airlines’ commitment to JetZero’s Z4 is more than just an investment—it’s a statement of intent. It declares that sustainable air travel isn’t a vague ambition, but a tangible goal that requires action now. Through a combination of technological boldness, operational foresight, and eco-conscious strategy, United is staking its future on innovation.

With its sights set on cleaner skies and cutting-edge cabins, the airline’s move into blended wing body aircraft offers a vision of what the next generation of aviation can be—quieter, greener, and radically more efficient.

The deal gives UA the option to purchase up to 200 Z4 aircraft (100 firm orders plus 100 options), subject to JetZero meeting key development milestones, notably a full-scale demonstrator flight in 2027, and meeting UA’s safety, business, and operational requirements.

The terms are conditional—UA has not disclosed the investment amount—but the commitment signals confidence in JetZero’s novel all-wing design. Andrew Chang, head of UA Ventures, said, “If successful, JetZero has the potential to evolve our core mainline business by developing aircraft with a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers while increasing fuel efficiency across our network.”​

Z4 Airframe: Efficiency and Specs

According to JetZero, the Z4 is designed as a twin-turbofan jetliner that carries around 250 passengers over transcontinental ranges. The startup says the Z4 will have a range of around 5,000 nautical miles and burn up to 50% less fuel per passenger mile than today’s conventional airliners of a similar size.

Key performance features include:

Blended-wing-body design: The aircraft’s wide “all-wing” planform generates lift across the cabin, dramatically reducing drag.

The two high-mounted turbofan engines, based on Pratt & Whitney’s PW2040, burn either conventional jet fuel or SAF blends.​

Fuel and sustainability: By reducing aerodynamic drag and flying at high altitude, the Z4 could use roughly 45% less fuel on specific routes (JetZero cites a Newark–Mallorca flight as an example)​.

It is optimized for conventional kerosene plus sustainable aviation fuels.

Airport compatibility: Despite its novel shape, the Z4 is sized to fit existing airport infrastructure. It requires no new runway, taxiway, or jet bridge modifications – it can use today’s gates and ground equipment without change.

Certification and timeline: JetZero recently passed a preliminary design review and expects a full-scale prototype, also known as a demonstrator, to fly by 2027.

The company targets entering service around 2030 as a fuel-efficient replacement for mid-sized twin-aisle jets.

Passenger Experience Innovations

JetZero’s BWB layout also promises a very different cabin experience. Without a narrow fuselage, the Z4 offers a wide, open-plan cabin that can be arranged flexibly​.

Key passenger benefits include:

Spacious seating: All classes get larger seats and more dedicated overhead bin space​.

The flat, wide cabin means aisles can be wider too.

Faster boarding: A single wide main boarding door feeds into multiple aisles and cabin bays, speeding up passenger flow.

With two or more aisles (depending on layout), boarding and deplaning could be much faster than on today’s twin-aisles.

Accessibility: Wider aisles and enlarged lavatories, including handicap-accessible facilities, are built in, aiming to improve accessibility for passengers with mobility challenges.

United believes these features can redefine long-haul comfort. As Chang noted, the Z4 could give “a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers” while also improving fuel efficiency​.

Tom O’Leary, JetZero’s CEO, said UA’s support “signals the industry’s belief that new, innovative technology is needed to achieve the efficiency and cost savings” demanded by growing air travel demand​.

He added that JetZero’s focus on the airframe is “the only one in development today that promises efficiency and an elevated customer experience.”

Strategic Context: UA’s Innovation Portfolio

United’s move on JetZero fits a broader strategy. UA Ventures (UAV), the carrier’s corporate venture arm, has been actively funding next-generation air transport technologies. Its portfolio spans electric, hydrogen, and advanced air mobility. For example, according to a report by Flight Global that further details JetZero's figures on orders, technical specs, and investment context, UAV has backed hybrid-electric regional airliner developers, hydrogen-fueled aircraft initiatives, and electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) projects.

UAV has made a number of alternative aircraft investments including:

Hybrid-electric

Hydrogen-powered

Electric Air Taxis (eVTOLs)

These investments support UA’s goals for a lower-carbon, more efficient future fleet. In recent years, UA also helped launch a US$100 million Sustainable Flight Fund to accelerate the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). By partnering with JetZero, UA adds a radical new airframe to its horizon of possibilities. If the Z4 proves out, it could become a “core mainline” aircraft for UA’s future long-haul fleet​.

As Chang put it, UAV is focused on companies “that can enhance the customer travel experience and help the airline lower its carbon footprint,” and JetZero “reflects that philosophy.” Sources: UA and JetZero press releases and aviation industry reports​.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c26eeea7cdaa706d97a75c/680b86669ea9aca6c72a6184_JZ%20image%203840x2011.jpg,N,,2025-04-25 18:56:59.971989

Meanwhile, the company reaffirmed its commitment to the environment. Boeing has long-term plans to cut emissions toward net zero and promote sustainability in aviation.

Let’s look at how the company performs this quarter and its carbon emission reduction strategy.

Earnings on the Ascent: Boeing Narrows Its Losses

In Q1 2025, Boeing reported a loss of 49 cents per share. While still a loss, this was an improvement from the $1.13 per share loss reported in the same quarter of 2024. The company’s total revenue rose 18%, reaching nearly $19.5 billion.

Analysts expected a loss of $1.18 per share and revenue of $19.38 billion. So, these results came as a positive surprise for investors.

Boeing’s CEO, Kelly Ortberg, noted that the company is beginning to see improvements in its operations due to a focus on safety and quality. He noted that,

“We are seeing early positive results and remain committed to making the fundamental changes needed to fully recover.”

Commercial airplane revenue grew significantly, increasing 75% to $8.15 billion. Boeing delivered 130 commercial aircraft during the quarter, a 57% increase compared to the same period last year. Part of this growth came from the company ramping up production after the previous year’s temporary grounding of its 737-9 aircraft.

The company aims to produce 38 of its 737 jets per month by the end of 2025. The 787 production line, which had stabilized at 5 jets per month earlier this year, could rise to 7 per month later in the year.

Boeing’s 777X program is now in an important testing phase with the FAA. The first delivery of the 777-9 is set for 2026.

Jet Set: Orders Fly In as Production Ramps Up

Boeing secured 221 net commercial airplane orders during Q1, including:

20 777-9 jets

20 787-10 jets

50 737-8 jets

This strong order activity boosted the company’s commercial backlog to over 5,600 aircraft, with a total value of about $460 billion.

In terms of cash flow, Boeing reported a free cash outflow of $2.29 billion. While still negative, it is better than the $3.93 billion outflow from the same period last year.

Boeing made headlines when President Trump chose them in March to build the new F-47 sixth-generation fighter jet. This decision replaced Lockheed Martin in this important role. This deal, however, is not yet included in the backlog figures.

Cash and Core: Boeing Sells Digital Unit for $10.6B Boost

In a significant move, Boeing announced a $10.55 billion all-cash deal with Thoma Bravo, a private equity firm. The agreement includes the sale of the company’s Digital Aviation Solutions business, which contains several key software platforms: Jeppesen, ForeFlight, AerData, and OzRunways.

Boeing plans to keep the parts of its digital business that provide aircraft and fleet data for both commercial and defense customers. These tools support diagnostics, maintenance, and repair services.

Following this news and the Q1 earnings release, Boeing’s stock rose by 6% on Wednesday. The company’s shares have recovered from earlier losses in April and are now down less than 3% for the year.

Flying Green: Boeing’s Net Zero Strategy

Beyond its financial performance, Boeing continues to push forward with environmental initiatives. The company has taken many steps to cut its carbon footprint worldwide to reach net-zero emissions.

RELATED: Boeing’s $11.8 Billion Annual Loss: A Path to Recovery and Net-Zero Ambitions

In 2023, Boeing reached net-zero carbon emissions for the fourth year in a row. This includes Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, along with some Scope 3 emissions like business travel. It achieved this through a mix of energy efficiency upgrades, expanded use of renewable energy, and certified carbon offsets.

At its major manufacturing sites—known as Core Metric Sites—Boeing closely monitors emissions and energy use. These locations represent 70% of the company’s total operational emissions.

Boeing verifies its data using utility bills and third-party assessments. This helps ensure transparency and accuracy.

The company’s strategy follows an “Avoid First, Remove Second” approach:

Avoid emissions by improving efficiency and switching to renewable energy, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Remove remaining emissions through permanent carbon removal solutions and offsets.

Boeing also aims to reduce its use of offsets by 2024, especially for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. However, offsets will continue to play a role for Scope 3 emissions, such as business travel, and in supporting voluntary carbon markets.

Cascade: A Tool for Industry-Wide Impact

In May 2023, Boeing introduced the Cascade Climate Impact Model as part of its net zero roadmap. Cascade is a data-based tool designed to help reduce emissions across the aviation industry. It shows how different strategies can reduce emissions. For example, replacing older planes with newer, efficient ones or optimizing flight paths can help.

Cascade also looks at the use of SAF, aircraft innovation, and market-based mechanisms. It is publicly available and backed by partners like NASA, IATA (the International Air Transport Association), and universities.

Boeing works with these partners to improve the tool and make it more useful for the aviation industry. The company is using these five ways to help the industry decarbonize.

The company also teamed up with Norsk e-Fuel to build one of Europe’s first big Power-to-Liquids (PtL) plants in Mosjøen, Norway. This collaboration will create sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). It combines green hydrogen with captured CO₂ to produce electro-SAF (e-SAF).

The initiative supports the EU’s RefuelEU targets, aiming for 6% SAF use by 2030 and 70% by 2050, with specific goals for e-SAF. Boeing’s investment accelerates SAF production, contributing to aviation’s net-zero emissions goal by 2050. ​

Boeing is sharing tools like Cascade and promoting sustainable aviation fuels. This helps the industry work towards its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.

Flight Path Forward

Boeing’s Q1 2025 performance suggests progress in its efforts to recover financially. At the same time, its environmental strategy reflects a long-term commitment to making air travel more sustainable.

Boeing faces a growing backlog of orders and has major aircraft development programs in progress. The company is also investing in renewable energy and innovation. These steps aim not just to return to profits but to lead the aviation industry toward cleaner and greener skies.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/shutterstock_2420198449.jpg,N,,2025-04-25 12:56:27.586766

This initiative enhances the airline’s sustainability efforts and aims to reduce carbon emissions across its network. EVA Air has already begun using SAF on flights departing from Europe and plans to integrate SAF at key hubs in North America, Japan, and Taiwan starting in the second quarter of 2025. Additionally, the airline successfully introduced locally produced SAF at Taiwan’s airports, marking a significant milestone in the region’s SAF adoption.

(PRESS RELEASE) TAOYUAN CITY, 2025-Apr-25 — /Travel PR News/ — EVA Air has announced new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) procurement agreements with three key suppliers: Associated Energy Group, LLC (AEG FUELS) from the United States, COSMO Oil Marketing Co., Ltd. (COSMO) from Japan, and Formosa Petrochemical Corporation from Taiwan. This strategic move underscores EVA Air’s strong commitment to sustainability and its efforts to broaden the use of SAF across its operations through long-term collaborations with both global and regional suppliers.

“Today, sustainable development is not just a choice—it is a responsibility,” said Clay Sun, President of EVA Air. “By partnering with AEG FUELS, COSMO, and Formosa Petrochemical Corporation, we are reaffirming our dedication to achieving net-zero emissions. Through the active integration of SAF across our global network, we aim to reduce our carbon footprint and contribute to positive change across the entire aviation supply chain.”

As part of the global effort to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, SAF is emerging as a key solution for reducing carbon emissions in aviation. EVA Air is already aligned with the European Union’s SAF supply policy, with flights departing from Europe having been using a 2% SAF blend since the first quarter of 2025. The new agreements are an important step forward, as EVA Air plans to begin regular SAF integration at major hubs in North America, Japan, and Taiwan starting in the second quarter of 2025. This expansion is expected to significantly reduce emissions from flight operations and pave the way for broader SAF adoption.

EVA Air has chosen to partner with three major suppliers to ensure a flexible and resilient fuel supply network. AEG FUELS, a leading international aviation fuel provider, will support the airline with a reliable global logistics network. COSMO, one of Japan’s top energy providers, will supply SAF in the Kansai region, including for the Osaka-Kansai Japan Expo through October 2025. Formosa Petrochemical Corporation, the first Taiwanese company to produce SAF in-house, strengthens the local supply chain resilience while supporting EVA Air’s operations in the region.

A significant milestone for EVA Air in advancing SAF adoption came on April 23, 2025, when the airline successfully introduced domestically produced SAF in collaboration with Taiwan’s Civil Aviation Administration. The SAF blend was applied to two international flights: BR156 from Taipei Songshan to Seoul Gimpo and BR148 from Kaohsiung to Kansai. This marks the official debut of SAF at Taiwan’s local airports, showcasing EVA Air’s commitment to sustainability and highlighting the growing resilience of Taiwan’s SAF supply infrastructure.

In addition to SAF initiatives, EVA Air has made significant environmental strides, including fleet modernization with new-generation fuel-efficient aircraft like the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350-1000, as well as optimizing flight routes to reduce fuel consumption and emissions.

Looking ahead, EVA Air plans to expand its SAF usage further and continue engaging in global sustainability initiatives, aiming to foster collaboration across the industry to usher in a new era of sustainable aviation.

This resulting sustainable aviation fuel can be used in planes flying now without modifications, making it one of the highest-impact near-term strategies to cut emissions from the aviation sector.
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, sustainable aviation fuel can reduce aviation emissions by up to 94%.
According to Hunter, camelina can reduce soil erosion by up to 80% and nitrate leaching by up to 90%.
“Minnesota is lucky to have partnerships across governments, businesses, academic institutions, and nonprofits that are driving Minnesota forward as a leader on sustainable aviation fuel.”","Camelina is what’s considered an ancient crop, one that Europeans cultivated thousands of years ago. It’s also considered an orphan crop, displaced by other more successful oilseeds like canola. With a $75,000 grant from the MPCA, however, the University of Minnesota’s Forever Green Initiative intends to make it a crop of the future that will help Minnesota develop a sustainable aviation fuel industry.

“Minnesota has the right reasons to lead on sustainable aviation fuel: a track record of environmental leadership, smart tax incentives, and a strong infrastructure,” said MPCA Commissioner Katrina Kessler, chair of the Governor’s Climate Change Subcabinet. “The MPCA is proud to invest in research that will help Minnesota grow a sustainable aviation fuel industry on our own soil from the ground up.”

Growing interest in growing camelina

One of over 15 crops the Forever Green Initiative is developing — and one of dozens of potential sources of sustainable aviation fuel — winter camelina has already generated a good deal of interest among Minnesota’s farmers for two big reasons, according to Mitch Hunter, the co-director of the initiative.

One, its tiny seeds produce a relatively high amount of an oil that can be crushed into cooking oil or further refined and blended to create jet fuel. This resulting sustainable aviation fuel can be used in planes flying now without modifications, making it one of the highest-impact near-term strategies to cut emissions from the aviation sector. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, sustainable aviation fuel can reduce aviation emissions by up to 94%.

Two, because it’s planted in the fall and harvested in the spring, hardy winter camelina makes for an excellent cover crop, one that provides farmers another source of revenue to supplement their income while protecting soil health and water quality. According to Hunter, camelina can reduce soil erosion by up to 80% and nitrate leaching by up to 90%.

As if all that weren’t enough, camelina blooms early in the spring, Hunter said, making it a resource for pollinators just waking up from their winter naps.

Camelina is on the first leg of its commercialization journey in Minnesota and the wider region.

“Farmers are already getting bags of seed and selling crops,” Hunter said. On-farm pilots of camelina have grown rapidly since the first was planted in 2021 — up to about 5,000 acres this year — and the first commercial flight fueled in part by camelina grown in Minnesota flew from MSP to La Guardia last September.

There’s still work to do before camelina takes off as a “cash cover crop,” as Hunter put it. He said if farmers across the region grow at least 1 million acres of camelina by 2035, the crop should have a steady flight path. To reach that goal, though, the Forever Green Initiative will need to “pull out all the stops” in terms of continued research, education and outreach, figuring out risk management for the crop, determining supply chain needs and regulatory barriers, and building market demand.

The MPCA grant will help the initiative create what Hunter called a “road map” to get to that million-acre goal.

“We are grateful that the State of Minnesota sees the potential of winter camelina to simultaneously help our farmers, environment, economy, and climate,"" Hunter said. “Minnesota is lucky to have partnerships across governments, businesses, academic institutions, and nonprofits that are driving Minnesota forward as a leader on sustainable aviation fuel.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/MPCASAF_1_7a575225ec.jpg,N,,2025-04-25 10:56:37.324034

JetZero's Z4 aircraft features an ""all wing"" design that reduces drag and produces lift across the entire wingspan. The company claims this could lead to as much as 50% reduction in fuel burn per passenger mile compared to similarly sized conventional aircraft.

Andrew Chang, head of United Airlines Ventures, explains the strategic importance of the investment: ""If successful, JetZero has the potential to evolve our core mainline business by developing aircraft with a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers while increasing fuel efficiency across our network.""

The Z4 is designed to accommodate 250 passengers and fly on conventional jet fuel, with propulsion systems compatible with sustainable aviation fuel blends. JetZero recently received substantial backing from the US military, with the US Air Force awarding the company a US$235 million contract to accelerate development of its commercial demonstrator.

""United's investment in our company signals the industry's belief that new, innovative technology is needed in order to achieve the efficiency and cost savings that will be required to meet the continued growth in demand for air travel across the globe,"" says Tom O'Leary, CEO and co-founder of JetZero.

Beyond fuel efficiency, the aircraft's unique design could potentially enhance the passenger experience with flexible seating options, larger seats across all classes, and dedicated overhead bin space for each seat. The company also claims the wider main boarding door could streamline the boarding process by leading to multiple aisles and passenger cabin bays for more efficient passenger distribution.

In one example highlighted by the companies, a flight from New York/Newark to Palma de Mallorca, Spain would use up to 45% less fuel compared to twin-aisle aircraft currently operating that route.

The aircraft is expected to integrate with existing airport infrastructure without requiring modifications to jet bridges, runways or taxiways - potentially reducing barriers to adoption by airlines.

United Airlines Ventures, the airline's corporate venture capital fund, has made several investments in alternative aircraft technologies, including hybrid-electric, hydrogen-powered, and electric air taxis, as part of its strategy to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

Independence and Liberty showed the best profits, depending on location and fertilizer rates. Notably, switchgrass required much less nitrogen fertilizer compared to corn.

Postdoctoral researcher Muhammad Umer Arshad highlighted that energy-type switchgrass can bring returns within two years, making marginal lands profitable. Another study led by Nictor Namoi found that switchgrass reduced nitrate leaching by 80% and nitrous oxide emissions compared to continuous corn fields.

Interestingly, carbon dioxide emissions were initially higher in switchgrass because of more root biomass. However, this also indicates greater long-term carbon storage. The perennial nature of switchgrass boosts soil health and offers strong ecosystem services.",,N,,2025-04-25 10:57:02.597981

University of Illinois researchers are exploring the potential of switchgrass, a deep-rooted prairie plant, as a biofuel source for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Their findings suggest that this native crop offers multiple benefits—both economically and environmentally—especially when grown on marginal land.

The SAF Grand Challenge launched in 2021 aims to produce 35 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel by 2050. Switchgrass is one of the promising bioenergy crops expected to contribute significantly to this target.

It grows well on low-quality farmland, requires less fertilizer than corn, and provides important ecosystem services.

Researchers tested three high-yielding switchgrass cultivars—Independence, Liberty, and Shawnee—alongside two traditional forage types in Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The team, led by postdoctoral researcher Muhammad Umer Arshad, studied how profitable each type was under two fertilizer levels.

Results showed that the newer cultivars, especially Independence and Liberty, performed better in most locations. Although the best fertilizer rate varied by site, the newer types consistently outperformed the traditional forage varieties in terms of yield and profitability.

In a separate study, postdoctoral fellow Nictor Namoi compared switchgrass to corn in terms of environmental impact. He found that switchgrass plots released far less nitrous oxide and nitrate into the environment. While carbon dioxide levels were higher due to larger root systems, the plant still showed great promise for long-term carbon storage.

Professor DoKyoung Lee, who oversaw both studies, said, “When we measure total biomass of switchgrass, there’s about 10 megagrams of carbon belowground. That’s huge.”

Overall, the research highlights switchgrass as a powerful alternative to corn for sustainable fuel. It offers farmers a way to use unproductive land efficiently while supporting clean energy goals.

The proposed location for the project is the Royal Port of Barrow for which Associated British Ports (ABP) announced a development masterplan to create an advanced engineering cluster.

GRAMM's SAF cuts carbon emissions fourfold beyond the UK requirements.

That enables the project to deliver 53.5 per cent of the UK's 2035 SAF target and create 850 jobs, according to GRAMM.

Alexander Peschkoff, GRAMM consortium lead, said: ""Advanced Fuels Fund support will propel UK sustainable aviation forward.

""Meeting a significant part of the UK aviation sector's net zero obligations will establish GRAMM as a leading sustainable aviation fuel producer.

""This project also proves that decarbonisation can tackle climate challenges while driving regional economic growth.""

Regional support for the project has been robus with assistance from the North West Net Zero Hub, a regional programme dedicated to promoting investment in energy projects, Net Zero North West (NZNW), an industry-led collaboration driving industrial decarbonisation across the North West, and Enterprising Cumbria, the newly-established body working to boost economic development throughout Cumbria county.

James Johnson, head of regional programme at North West Net Zero Hub, said: ""GRAMM has assembled a very strong consortium to progress their proposals for a first-of-a-kind large-scale SAF production facility.

""Support from the Aviation Fuel Fund, if approved, would help the project progress. The North West Net Zero Hub has been pleased to support GRAMM.

""We recognise the importance of the national policy framework for sustainable aviation fuel, and if successful, the GRAMM project could be a transformative opportunity for the North West, creating substantial job and supply chain opportunities throughout its delivery phases.""

Jane Gaston, CEO NZNW, said: ""As the home to two of the UK's airports, Net Zero North West recognised in our manifesto the importance of providing a resilient supply of significant volumes of sustainable fuel to support the aviation industry.

""Our own work in developing the North West Industrial Cluster Plan shows that the North West is uniquely placed to deliver transformational projects such as this.

""It's therefore no surprise that GRAMM have chosen to target delivery of this project in our region.""

She added: ""With a combination of expertise driven by our industry and the people who work there, our natural geological assets both on and off shore, and our transportation links, including our ports, this project could further enhance the £30billion pipeline of projects already identified across carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, renewables, nuclear and battery which will not only deliver significant carbon reductions, but, critically, support industry in the North West to continue to make a positive contribution to the UK's economic growth whilst operating in a more sustainable way.""

If the application is successful, the funding from the UK Advanced Fuels Fund will move it from the planning stage to implementation, enabling the project to become a reality.",https://www.nwemail.co.uk/resources/images/19367209.jpg?type=og-image,N,,2025-04-25 10:57:06.858982

The newly released 2025 Minnesota Energy Factsheet, produced by Clean Energy Economy MN and the Business Council for Sustainable Energy, offers a clear snapshot of how our state’s energy policies are paying off. With electricity demand expected to surge, fueled by artificial intelligence, data centers, and domestic manufacturing, Minnesota is showing how to meet that challenge with a reliable, affordable, and resilient clean energy system.

A foundation built on performance, not promises

For the fifth year in a row, more than half of Minnesota’s electricity came from zero-carbon sources, including renewables and nuclear, well above the national average of 42%. In 2024, zero-carbon sources made up 53% of Minnesota’s energy mix. In 2024, coal generation declined to an all-time low of 20% of Minnesota’s energy mix and is being displaced by increased generation from natural gas and renewables.

These results aren’t the result of ideology. It results from sustained, smart policies and investments delivering real-world benefits. Carbon emissions from the state’s power sector fell another 4% last year, putting us 52% below 2005 levels, far ahead of the U.S. average reduction of 38%.

Clean energy and economic growth aren’t at odds in Minnesota; they work together.

Strengthening energy independence and security

As the country experiences disrupted supply chains and transitions to an America-first mentality, Minnesota is reducing its reliance on out-of-state electricity. In 2024, only 11% of the state’s electricity came from imports, down from 13% the year prior. That means more energy is produced and consumed at home, keeping dollars circulating in local economies, mitigating geopolitical risks, and improving the efficiency of our electricity grid.

This progress comes as the country braces for unprecedented growth in electricity demand. According to S&P Global Commodity Insights, U.S. demand could rise by 35% to 50% by 2040. Meeting that growth will require every available energy solution. Minnesota is already proving what works.

Renewables are rising — and they’re reliable

One-third of Minnesota’s electricity came from renewable sources last year. The state added 388 megawatts of solar capacity, a 35% increase over 2023. Over the past five years, 99% of new power generation in Minnesota has come from renewable sources. These additions are low-cost, flexible, and the quickest to deploy.

National trends echo this momentum. In 2024, U.S. companies signed a record 183 clean energy deals, totaling 28 gigawatts of new capacity. The United States also saw increased market demand for clean fuels, including renewable natural gas and sustainable aviation fuel. These investments reflect a growing recognition that renewables and storage are central to meeting demand and maintaining reliability.

Efficiency drives affordability

Minnesota continues to be a leader in energy efficiency — ranked 10th nationally and first in the Midwest in 2024. Our energy productivity has improved by 37% since 2001, with a 9% gain in the last five years alone.

Even as prices rise across the country, Minnesota is keeping electricity affordable. The state’s average retail rate was 12.36 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2024, below the national average of 12.99 cents. Strategic investments and technological innovation in energy efficiency continue to reduce energy waste while saving businesses and households money.

Efficiency programs under the ECO Act save Minnesotans hundreds of millions of dollars annually, showing how well-implemented clean energy policies are also financially responsible.

Laying the groundwork for what’s next

Building on the success of technologies like wind and solar, demand continues to grow for new and emerging energy technologies across all economic sectors. Minnesota is actively investing in the future: scaling up infrastructure for electric vehicles and sustainable aviation fuel, integrating new solutions for heating and cooling homes and buildings, and preparing to lead in clean hydrogen. As of late 2024, more than 65,000 EVs were on Minnesota roads — our highest number yet — with charging infrastructure expanding to support further growth.

This forward-looking approach positions Minnesota to lead in sectors that will define the next era of American energy.

Now is not the time to pull back

Minnesota’s story is one of progress through pragmatic policy. However, continued success, here and across the country, depends on stable, forward-thinking policies at both the state and federal levels.

Congress must protect the bipartisan energy tax credits that fuel private investment, reduce energy costs, and create jobs. These incentives provide the certainty businesses need to plan long-term, deploy capital, and bring new energy projects online. Weakening or reversing them would threaten energy reliability, affordability, and American competitiveness.

State and federal energy policy should match the urgency and opportunity of this moment. With electricity demand rising and grid capacity under pressure, we need to move forward faster, not slower. That means streamlining permitting, modernizing infrastructure, and maintaining tax policies that enable the efficient deployment of innovative clean energy solutions.

Minnesota is the blueprint

The numbers speak for themselves: increased energy independence, affordable electricity, steady economic growth, and lower emissions. Minnesota is delivering and offering the rest of the country a roadmap for what success looks like.

We’re not just keeping the lights on. We’re lighting the way forward.

Building on the successful collaboration between Future Travel Experience (FTE) and Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT) for the Aviation & Robotics Summit in 2023 and 2024, the FTE World Innovation Summit — free for airlines and airports to attend — will bring together over 400 air transport industry innovators for a three-day interdisciplinary series of conference sessions, interactive workshops, tours of the new terminal at PIT and across key innovation sites across Pittsburgh, plus extensive networking opportunities.

Energy & Sustainability is a major focus, tackling key topics including approaches to scaling the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), electric, low carbon energy, hydrogen and more across air transport.

The FTE World Innovation Summit agenda, which can be viewed here, features key sessions focused on ‘How do we ensure air transport gets the green credentials it needs at best speed?’ — a session that will be moderated by Mary Kirby, Founder, Editor and Publisher of Runway Girl Network — and ‘What are the best approaches to scaling the use of SAF, Electric & Hydrogen across air transport?’

Plus, there will be Energy & Sustainability innovation tours across Pittsburgh, an Energy & Sustainability ‘Meet the Innovators Pitch Session’, and much more.

Among the high-level speakers are Chad Willis, Director, Planning, Environmental, & Sustainability, Allegheny County Airport Authority; John Thomas, CEO, Connect Airlines; Marion N. Chivot-Legris, Director, ESG & Sustainability Strategy, Edmonton International Airport; and Costa Samaras, Director, Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation; Professor, Civil and Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University. Here, they each share some compelling insights ahead of the event.

PIT “working to establish a new paradigm as an energy hub”

Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT) is a trailblazer in sustainability. Its innovations include the first-of-its-kind microgrid, powering the entire facility — including the new terminal opening this year — with natural gas and solar energy.

“Here at PIT we are working to establish a new paradigm where an airport can demonstrate that it has a role as an energy hub and not simply as a transportation hub,” says Chad Willis, Director, Planning, Environmental, & Sustainability, Allegheny County Airport Authority. “All of the users of an airport have a tremendous need for energy — electricity, hydrogen and fuels — and we believe that we can facilitate cleaner and more resilient options for those users.”

PIT is currently working with partners to build out infrastructure to produce hydrogen and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) onsite to provide clean fuel options to users. “Furthermore, we are working with partners across multiple industries to position PIT as the preeminent location to test new technology and equipment — things like alternative fuel vehicles and aircraft,” Willis explains.

At the FTE World Innovation Summit, Willis is participating in a session focused on the best approaches to scaling the use of SAF, electric & hydrogen across air transport. “We are very excited to be a part of the discussions at the FTE World Innovation Summit as these always lead to new ways of solving the industry’s problems. The message I have for the industry is that airports can absolutely be an integral partner in furthering the sustainability objectives of those that operate within its ecosystem, so let’s work together and do great things.”

Connect Airlines innovating in zero carbon technology

John Thomas, CEO, Connect Airlines, is participating in an Energy & Sustainability session at the FTE World Innovation Summit focused on ‘How do we ensure air transport gets the green credentials it needs at best speed?’

“The opportunity already exists today with the replacement of aging uneconomic 50-seat regional jets in the U.S. with existing turboprop technology in the likes of the ATR72 and Q400s,” says Thomas.

“The turboprops reduce carbon emissions by roughly 40% and can operate at significantly better economics than the 50-seat RJs. The turboprops under the Connect Airlines business model will also provide a better customer experience than current regional aircraft — for example, the leading-edge Starlink WiFi system is now certified on both the ATR72 and the Q400 that provides free gate-to-gate connectivity for passengers. Both aircraft have larger overhead bins than 50-seat regional jets and the Connect business model calls for the introduction of a premium economy product, both soft and hard, on turboprops — a world first. And all for the same block time as regional jets on the routes that we will serve.”

As an industry innovator in terms of zero carbon technology adoption, Connect Airlines believes the sweet spot in terms of alternative fuels, at least in regional aviation, is liquid hydrogen that powers an electric engine through fuel cell technology. “This combination is 11 times more energy efficient than current jet engines using Jet-A,” Thomas explains.

Looking ahead to the FTE World Innovation Summit, he adds: “There is a lot of innovation in the airline industry at the moment, much of which is under the radar. So, the FTE World Innovation Summit provides a great opportunity to better understand what is going on.”

YEG pioneering hydrogen and new clean technology applications

Edmonton International Airport (YEG) believes in developing the airport as an energy hub. Its approach is pragmatic — supporting Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) while actively pioneering hydrogen and new clean technology applications.

“We are engaging with suppliers and airlines to ensure future availability and feasibility for our region,” says Marion N. Chivot-Legris, Director, ESG & Sustainability Strategy, Edmonton International Airport. “For example, in our efforts to advance low-carbon energy, we are working closely with partners — airlines and ground handlers — to support the transition to electric ground operations.”

YEG works closely with the key Edmonton Metropolitan Region’s players on the regional Hydrogen Hub. The Edmonton Region Hydrogen HUB (ERH2) has recently relaunched, further solidifying the Edmonton Region as Canada’s leader in hydrogen innovation.

“We are actively integrating hydrogen into our ecosystem through the whole value chain, starting from ground vehicles to exploring infrastructure development or hydrogen light- or heavy-duty vehicles, to be ready for hydrogen application in aviation,” Chivot-Legris explains.

YEG is a trailblazer in sustainability, including plans for the world’s largest solar farm at an airport, and is driving innovation across multiple areas. “Alongside our hydrogen initiatives, we are continuously upgrading airport facilities — improving lighting, HVAC and overall energy efficiency to reduce consumption,” says Chivot-Legris. “These efforts are essential to our decarbonization strategy.”

Looking ahead, Chivot-Legris is participating in an Energy & Sustainability session at the FTE World Innovation Summit focused on the best approaches to scaling the use of SAF, electric & hydrogen across air transport. “I can’t wait to connect with global leaders and dive into real, actionable solutions for aviation’s energy transition. Events like this aren’t just about ideas — they’re about making things happen! It’s a chance to collaborate, spark new partnerships and push the industry forward. So, don’t miss out — join the conversation, share your insights and help shape the future of sustainable aviation!”

Carnegie Mellon University: “Now is the time for leadership to ensure that the future of air transport is clean and carbon neutral”

Costa Samaras, Director, Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation; Professor, Civil and Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), is participating in an Energy & Sustainability session at the FTE World Innovation Summit focused on ‘How do we ensure air transport gets the green credentials it needs at best speed?’

“There is a huge opportunity for clean energy innovation in the air transport sector. Now is the time for leadership to ensure that the future of air transport is clean and carbon neutral,” Samaras explains.

“I’m so excited about the great work the Scott Institute and CMU is doing to deliver energy and climate solutions. These are the technologies, systems, and policies that will tackle climate change, and make energy clean, affordable, reliable, and resilient.”

Looking ahead, Samaras is eager to participate in the FTE World Innovation Summit.

The BWB design, which integrates the wings and fuselage into a single aerodynamic structure, is expected to cut fuel consumption per passenger mile by up to 50% compared to similarly sized aircraft. This could help United lower its carbon footprint and operating costs.

The aircraft, named the JetZero Z4, is designed to carry around 250 passengers and fly on both conventional jet fuel and sustainable aviation fuel blends.

The design also aims to improve passenger comfort and airport compatibility. JetZero claims the aircraft will offer larger seats, dedicated overhead bin space for each passenger, and wider aisles. Despite the unusual shape, the aircraft is intended to operate from existing airports without requiring modifications to infrastructure.

This investment was made through United Airlines Ventures (UAV), the airline’s venture capital arm.

UAV has previously backed companies developing alternative aircraft technologies including hybrid-electric, hydrogen-powered and electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, all aimed at supporting United’s goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.

United Airlines Ventures head Andrew Chang said: “If successful, JetZero has the potential to evolve our core mainline business by developing aircraft with a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers while increasing fuel efficiency across our network.”

JetZero is also under contract with the US Air Force, which committed $235m last year to accelerate the development of a full-scale demonstrator. The military is eyeing the design for cargo transport and refuelling missions — roles that currently make up the majority of its annual fuel use.

JetZero’s chief executive and co-founder Tom O’Leary said: “United’s investment in our company signals the industry’s belief that new, innovative technology is needed in order to achieve the efficiency and cost savings that will be required to meet the continued growth in demand for air travel across the globe.

Boeing Commercial Airplanes is busy working to bring three long-delayed aircraft through certification: the 737 Max 7, 737 Max 10 and 777-9.
Some analysts always doubted Boeing would actually use truss-braced wings for its next production aircraft, citing complexity and risk.
“NASA and Boeing are currently evaluating an updated approach to the agency’s Sustainable Flight Demonstrator project that would focus on demonstrating thin-wing technology with broad applications for multiple aircraft configurations,” NASA says.","Boeing this summer will stop developing NASA’s X-66 truss-braced-wing demonstrator aircraft and shift its focus specifically toward developing thin-wing technology that had been central to X-66’s design.

“By this summer, we will complete near-term X-66 demonstrator milestones – specifically the process of removing the wings – and then put the MD-90 activities on pause to focus on the thin-wing technology, which could have more direct benefit on future generations of commercial aircraft,” Boeing said on 25 April.

“As a result of this focus, some team members will move to Commercial Airplanes to support our development and certification efforts,” Boeing adds.

Boeing Commercial Airplanes is busy working to bring three long-delayed aircraft through certification: the 737 Max 7, 737 Max 10 and 777-9.

Several media outlets broke news on 24 April of Boeing’s development pull back.

The $1.15 billion X-66 was to be a heavily modified MD-90 equipped with long, slender wings supported by trusses – a complex design, but one engineers say would generate less drag, improving fuel efficiency.

Boeing in January 2023 won the NASA contract to develop the aircraft under the agency’s Sustainable Flight Demonstrator programme, with first flight intended in 2028.

“Development work is inherently dynamic,” Boeing says. “We can deliver value sooner by focusing on thin-wing design, which is applicable to multiple configurations and allows us to establish a sustainable and enduring capability to develop a pipeline of new-wing technologies.”

Boeing executives had previously said the truss-braced architecture might be suited for its next passenger aircraft, but the company never committed to the design. Some analysts always doubted Boeing would actually use truss-braced wings for its next production aircraft, citing complexity and risk.

Boeing now calls thin wings X-66’s “most-promising design feature”.

NASA confirms Boeing’s shift, saying the company now envisions having a “ground-based testbed to demonstrate the potential for long, thin wing technology”.

“NASA and Boeing are currently evaluating an updated approach to the agency’s Sustainable Flight Demonstrator project that would focus on demonstrating thin-wing technology with broad applications for multiple aircraft configurations,” NASA says. “The Boeing proposal identifies the thin-wing concept as having broad applications for potential incorporation into aircraft with and without truss braces.”

NATA notes that X-66’s design involved a “more-complex” structure of trusses.

The partners had already started modifying the MD-90 at a site in Palmdale, California.

Boeing has been studying truss-braced wings for decades. Named for the trusses that are required to support them, such wings are longer and thinner than traditional wings, which reduces drag, improving fuel efficiency by up to 25%, according to NASA and Boeing.

Drawbacks include the complexity and weight of the trusses and related support structure. Long wings are also more prone to the dangerous condition of flutter.

In awarding Boeing the contract to build the jet in 2023, NASA said it would contribute $425 million, with Boeing and its commercial partners kicking in another $725 million, for a total project cost of $1.15 billion. The aircraft was to have wings measuring 52m (170ft) – about 17m longer than a 737’s.",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/5/0/1/109501_boeingtrussbraceconcept011823_336935.jpg,N,,2025-04-25 05:56:26.044318

“The partnership between BZI and FHE sets a strong example for the kind of cooperation we need to scale clean energy solutions.”","Kuala Lumpur: Malaysia is taking a major step toward becoming a key player in the global clean energy market with the development of a large-scale Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) refinery. The project stems from a strategic partnership between international investment firm Bin Zayed International (BZI) and local biofuel specialist FatHopes Energy (FHE).

Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability Minister Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad called the initiative a “game-changer” for both Malaysia’s energy and aviation sectors. “This investment will serve as a catalyst for far-reaching transformation. It marks Malaysia’s emergence as a serious contender in the global clean energy and low-carbon economy,” he said at the signing ceremony.

The planned SAF facility will use the HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) process — the same technology behind over 80% of SAF produced globally. The project will combine BZI’s international investment experience with FHE’s deep knowledge in sourcing sustainable biofuel feedstock.

The goal is to establish a fully integrated SAF production facility with a capacity of up to one million tonnes per year. Commercial operations are expected to begin in 2029. As part of the deal, BZI will also acquire a strategic stake in FHE, aligning the two companies on long-term goals related to sustainability and innovation.

The refinery is expected to help Malaysia reduce its dependence on imported SAF, boost energy security, and position itself as a key SAF producer and exporter in Southeast Asia.

“This initiative is in line with the outcome of the first Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement. It puts Malaysia on the map as a regional leader in the fast-growing SAF sector,” said Nik Nazmi.

The minister emphasized the importance of the project in helping the aviation industry reduce emissions — a key challenge for a sector heavily reliant on fossil fuels. “Air travel is essential, but it must become sustainable,” he said. “This development will support airlines in meeting emissions reduction targets and contribute to Malaysia’s broader net-zero goals.”

The SAF refinery supports several national priorities, including the National Energy Transition Roadmap and the Malaysian Aviation Decarbonisation Blueprint. These frameworks call for a gradual increase in SAF blending, starting with a 1% mandate and aiming for a 47% blend by 2050.

In addition to environmental benefits, the project is expected to create economic opportunities for small businesses and local communities involved in collecting used cooking oil and waste oils — key feedstocks for SAF.

“This project shows what’s possible when foreign and local players work together,” Nik Nazmi said. “The partnership between BZI and FHE sets a strong example for the kind of cooperation we need to scale clean energy solutions.”",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Vinesh-Sinha-Fat-Hopes-image-updated.jpg,N,,2025-04-25 10:57:51.891421

EVA Air has taken a significant step towards advancing its sustainability goals by securing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) procurement agreements with three key suppliers: Associated Energy Group, LLC (AEG FUELS) from the United States, COSMO Oil Marketing Co., Ltd. (COSMO) from Japan, and Formosa Petrochemical Corporation from Taiwan. This move not only broadens EVA Air’s SAF initiatives but also establishes enduring partnerships with both international and local suppliers, underlining the airline’s long-term commitment to a more eco-friendly aviation industry.

“Today, sustainable development is not just a choice—it is a responsibility,” said EVA Air President Clay Sun. “Our bilateral collaborations with AEG FUELS, COSMO, and Formosa Petrochemical Corporation reflect our commitment to net-zero emissions. By actively introducing SAF across our global network, we are reducing our operational carbon footprint and fostering transformation and growth throughout the aviation supply chain.”

As the world strives toward the collective goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has emerged as one of the aviation industry’s most effective solutions for carbon reduction. EVA Air is fully aligned with the European Union’s SAF supply policy, with all flights departing from Europe now operating with a 2% SAF blend since the beginning of 2025. The signing of new SAF agreements represents the next milestone in EVA Air’s sustainability journey, with plans to begin regular SAF integration at key hubs in North America, Japan, and Taiwan starting in the second quarter of 2025. These actions are set to significantly reduce flight emissions and pave the way for wider SAF adoption across the aviation industry.

EVA Air has forged partnerships with three prominent suppliers to further its SAF initiatives. AEG FUELS, a globally recognized aviation fuel provider, brings an extensive and reliable international logistics network. COSMO, one of Japan’s leading energy companies, will supply SAF in the Kansai region, including for the Osaka-Kansai Japan Expo through October 2025. Meanwhile, Formosa Petrochemical Corporation, Taiwan’s first company to supply domestically produced SAF, is bolstering the resilience of the local supply chain. These collaborations enhance EVA Air’s fuel supply flexibility, expand SAF usage throughout the Asia-Pacific region, and accelerate the sustainable transition of aviation fuel in the area.

In a significant step forward for SAF adoption, EVA Air successfully introduced domestically produced SAF on April 23, 2025, as part of the Civil Aviation Administration’s pilot program for SAF usage. The SAF was blended into two international flights: BR156 from Taipei Songshan Airport to Seoul Gimpo International Airport, and BR148 from Kaohsiung International Airport to Kansai International Airport in Japan. This marked the official launch of SAF usage at Taiwan’s local airports, showcasing EVA Air’s strong sustainability commitment and highlighting the maturity of Taiwan’s domestic SAF supply chain.

EVA Air has made considerable strides in sustainability in recent years. Its efforts on the environmental front include fleet modernization with new, fuel-efficient aircraft such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350-1000, as well as optimizing flight routes to reduce fuel consumption and emissions.

Looking to the future, EVA Air will continue to increase its use of SAF and engage actively in global sustainability initiatives.

The company is creating an aircraft design that has the potential to deliver jet fuel efficiency and a greatly enhanced customer experience. The investment includes a path to order up to 100 airplanes and an option for an additional 100. The conditional purchase agreement is based on JetZero achieving development milestones, including flight of a full-scale demonstrator in 2027, among other conditions, including that the aircraft meet United's safety, business and operating requirements.

JetZero’s innovative design reduces drag and produces lift across the entire wingspan, which could lead to as much as 50% reduction in fuel burn per passenger mile compared to a similar sized aircraft. The technology could potentially help United lower its carbon emissions while reducing the cost of operations. In 2023, the U.S. Air Force announced a $235 million contract to JetZero to fast-track the development of JetZero’s full scale demonstrator. The JetZero Z4 airplane is designed to accommodate 250 passengers and fly on conventional jet fuel, with propulsion systems able to utilize sustainable aviation fuel blends.

“If successful, JetZero has the potential to evolve our core mainline business by developing aircraft with a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers while increasing fuel efficiency across our network,” said Andrew Chang, head of United Airlines Ventures (UAV). “United Airlines Ventures® was created to support our efforts to find innovative companies that can enhance the customer travel experience and help the airline lower its carbon footprint, and we believe JetZero reflects that philosophy.”

“United’s investment in our company signals the industry’s belief that new, innovative technology is needed in order to achieve the efficiency and cost savings that will be required to meet the continued growth in demand for air travel across the globe,” said Tom O’Leary, CEO and co-founder of JetZero. “JetZero is focused on one key technology – the airframe – that enables us to address all of the barriers to growth. This program is the only one in development today that promises efficiency and an elevated customer experience.”

Both the airplane’s shape, and the way JetZero plans to enter the plane into service, address industry pain points. The design contributes to a more efficient operation due to its shape and the higher altitude at which it will fly. For instance, a flight from New York/Newark to Palma de Mallorca, Spain would use up to 45 percent less fuel compared to the twin-aisle aircraft that operate that route today. The airplane also is expected to integrate readily into today’s airport infrastructure, requiring no new accommodations for jet bridges, runways or taxiways.

The aircraft design has the potential to also offer improvements to the passenger experience like flexible seating options, larger seats across all classes, and dedicated overhead bin space for each seat. Additionally, the design streamlines the boarding process with a main boarding door that is wider than that of a comparably sized aircraft, leading to multiple aisles and passenger cabin bays for more efficient passenger distribution. It may further enhance accessibility by featuring wider aisles and handicap-accessible lavatories, creating a comfortable travel environment for all passengers and in-flight crew.

JetZero’s agreement with the Air Force focuses on advancing airframe technology and capabilities, showcasing its potential, and providing the Department of Defense and commercial industry more options to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. Several military aircraft configurations can be made with this design, including air transport and refueling tanker variants, which collectively account for approximately 60% of the Air Force’s total annual jet fuel consumption.

United's corporate venture capital fund, United Airlines Ventures, enables the airline to invest in emerging companies that have the potential to influence the future of travel.

Leeham News: We do a Corner series about the state of developments to improve the emission situation for Air Transport. We try to understand why development has been slow.

Over the last Corners, we examined the non-CO2 effects of Air Transport that contribute to global warming. Contrails had the largest effects, even larger than the CO2 emissions from Air Transport.

To complete the review of our progress with lower emission actions for Air Transport, we will examine the present situation with SAF, Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

Jet Fuel

I did a comprehensive run-down of Jet Fuel and SAF a few years ago; you can find it here. Here, we summarize the key points and describe where we are with SAF and SAF blends in our Jet-A1 aviation fuel.

Jet Fuel, or more precisely Jet A1, is a mixture of over 2,000 different hydrocarbons. It’s classified as a Kerosene-type fuel. It’s produced in a cracking process from crude oil, which was, in turn, created from dead zooplankton and algae sediments that changed into oil under heat and pressure over millions of years.

The plankton and algae absorbed CO2 from the atmosphere as they grew. When we burn refined crude oil, we release the fuel’s carbon atoms as CO2. The time separation of absorption and release of millions of years creates our CO2 problem.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel, SAF

Sustainable Aviation Fuel, SAF, is a hydrocarbon fuel in which CO2 is absorbed from the atmosphere near the time of its CO2 release when burning the fuel.

There are a wide variety of processes where capturing CO2 into a hydrocarbon mix can create a SAF, Figure 1. The HEFA process is dominant today, where different biomasses are processed into SAF.

Other possible process chains (called Pathways in the industry) involve fermenting alcohols from agricultural or other waste materials and then converting the alcohol into SAF. There is also a waste pathway where waste gasification and Fischer-Tropsch processing form an SAF. Both pathways are of little importance today, but have long-term potential.

The final SAF pathway is called E-fuels, which involves producing hydrogen from water by electrolysis. Carbon atoms are then added to the hydrogen in a Fischer-Tropsch process, where the carbon comes from CO2/CO air capture. The result is an SAF hydrocarbon produced from water and energy (thus the name E-fuel).

SAF volumes and costs, today and tomorrow

The HEFA biofuel process is the lower-cost alternative, resulting in biofuels that cost four to five times the current price of Jet A1. The technology with no restrictions on feedstock, the E-fuels are highly dependent on the cost of the used energy. Until new energy sources such as Solar Power in desert areas are established, the energy costs for E-fuels will make these more costly than biofuels.

The SAF problem areas

SAF has two main problems: ramping up production and aircraft compatibility. Of these, aircraft compatibility is the easiest one.

Classical rubber seals used in aircraft fuel systems rely on aromatic compounds in the fuel to keep the seals supple. Pure biofuel or E-fuels lack such compounds. Therefore, SAFs lacking such compounds must be mixed with Jet fuel to keep the seals from shrinking and generating leaks.

This is the background to the need for blends for aircraft that don’t use modern seal materials for their fuel systems. Right now, most aircraft and engines are approved for up to a 50% SAF blend.

The bigger problem is the ramp-up of production. During 2024, we produced and consumed around 300 million tonnes of Jet Fuel. Of these, 1 million tonnes were SAF, or 0.3%. For 2025, the production of SAF is planned to increase to 1.5 million tonnes, or 0.5%.

We are a long way from producing enough SAF to satisfy a 2030 target of a 10% blend of SAF in Jet Fuel. For that, we need 30 tonnes of SAF (if the consumption stays the same), which is a growth rate of 30 times in five years, or 6 tonnes per year, or 600% in the first year. We have around 50% as the projected SAF production is 1.5 million tonnes in 2025.",https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/By-Bjorn-Fehrm.png,N,,2025-04-25 03:56:26.091034

Sustainable aviation fuel will account for 53% of the company’s decarbonisation, it states, while a further 21% will be sourced from advancements in aircraft and engine technology.

Another 7% will be driven by fleet renewal.

But Wizz Air corporate and ESG officer Yvonne Moynihan warns that the “current pace of change is not enough”.

The airline says industry efforts to meet net-zero by 2050 are sliding “off course”, arguing that achieving the target depends heavily on technological industrialisation which is yet to emerge.

Wizz’s roadmap puts “greater emphasis” on sustainable aviation fuel – rather than “unproven technologies and offsetting” – compared with other airlines, it says.

Such fuel is the “cornerstone” of its strategy and the “biggest lever” for decarbonisation, it adds, but production remains limited and prices are uncompetitive for a budget carrier.

“We need action, not just ambition,” says Moynihan. “That’s why we’re calling on governments, regulators, and the fuel industry to wake up to the reality of aviation’s transition and start delivering the changes that will make net-zero possible.”

The airline is pressing governments to scale production of sustainable fuel and introduce incentives to reduce the price gap with conventional fuel.

Wizz adds that a commitment to address the situation is “not just an environmental imperative” but a “strategic necessity” for the European aviation sector if it is to achieve long-term sustainability, competitiveness and resilience.

Beneath the gentle sway of native Midwestern grasses lies an untapped strategic asset—one that may soon soar far above its traditional ecosystem. Recent research from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign casts a familiar plant, switchgrass, into a new light: as a resilient, resource-efficient, and economically viable feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel.

This development arrives amidst the broader momentum of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge, aiming to produce 35 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2050. Against this backdrop, the quiet strength of switchgrass may turn out to be a pivotal asset in aligning aviation with carbon-reduction targets.

The Agricultural Legacy with Aerospace Potential

Switchgrass has weathered millennia of climate shifts, and its biology is well-suited for contemporary sustainability needs. A perennial grass, it grows deep root systems and yields abundant biomass year after year—without the annual replanting typical of conventional crops. Its demand for synthetic nitrogen fertilizers is minimal, which means lower emissions during cultivation and reduced strain on agricultural ecosystems.

The new research focuses on modern cultivars—Independence, Liberty, and Carthage—engineered for energy output. Planted across Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota, these cultivars were evaluated over five years for yield and profitability. The results challenge a long-standing belief that marginal lands are economically unproductive.

Land Use Economics and Regional Optimization

The study’s economic angle brings forward an insight beyond bioenergy alone: a redefinition of land value. Liberty and Independence emerged as top performers, depending on the regional climate zone and fertilizer input. For instance, Liberty proved most profitable in zone 5b, while Independence flourished in zone 6a.

Such site-specific profitability modeling allows for targeted guidance to farmers and policymakers alike. With modest nitrogen inputs, these grasses offer returns as early as two years post-planting, particularly on marginal lands. This opens the door to productive use of areas previously dismissed as commercially irrelevant, presenting a land management paradigm that reduces competition with food crops.

A Biochemical Engine with Environmental Perks

Beyond economics, switchgrass also strengthens environmental resilience. A complementary study compared its ecosystem impact with continuous corn farming under no-till practices. The differences were notable.

Nitrous oxide emissions, a potent greenhouse gas, were significantly lower in switchgrass systems—attributable to its reduced fertilizer needs. Similarly, nitrate leaching dropped by 80 percent over three years. Though CO2 emissions from switchgrass plots were higher due to extensive root biomass respiration, this effect could translate into long-term soil carbon storage, enhancing sequestration potential.

These data suggest a dual benefit: enabling renewable fuel production while enhancing soil health and water quality. This positions switchgrass not only as a fuel source but also as a regenerative land steward.

Timing the Takeoff: Market Readiness and System Resilience

While current demand for switchgrass as a SAF feedstock remains low, the infrastructure to deploy it rapidly is now emerging. Economic and policy shifts—including biofuel incentives and carbon pricing—may accelerate this transition.

Importantly, the research underlines a strategic concept: preparedness. Cultivars are now proven, profitable models exist, and ecosystem data confirm sustainability advantages. When the market aligns, the supply chain can pivot to scale switchgrass quickly and effectively.

Conclusion: Rethinking Biomass from Below the Surface

The prairie plant once overlooked as mere ground cover may soon play a critical role in sustainable aviation. Switchgrass is more than a biomass source—it is a resilient, regionally adaptable, low-input crop with layered benefits that extend from soil to sky.

As the world seeks scalable climate solutions that align with both ecological integrity and economic feasibility, switchgrass may very well embody the kind of intelligent agriculture that powers clean aviation without compromise.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Copy-of-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-39-1024x576.png,N,,2025-04-25 06:56:09.991091

The Port Klang refinery, he said is expected to anchor Malaysia’s broader ambition to produce one million tonnes of SAF annually, bolstering the country’s position as a central player in the global SAF economy.

“This initiative has the potential to reimagine the future of flight.

“We will also explore advanced SAF technologies alongside FHE’s refining partner and technology provider.

“It’s about profit, people and the planet, that’s what inspired this partnership, but most importantly, it’s for the planet,” Shamir added.

From FHE’s perspective, the project is currently at the feasibility stage and is being developed as a 300,000-tonne-per-annum facility.

“That will be the production capacity, which will require about 330,000 tonnes of feed material,” said Vinesh Sinha, Chief Executive Officer of FatHopes Energy.

“The technology is capable of processing multiple feedstocks and will be guided by prevailing policies and certifications.”

While financing has been fully committed by BZI, Sinha acknowledged that the primary challenges lie in the technical aspects of the refinery’s development.

“The biggest challenge that we face is really on the technical front.

“There’s a lot of input materials we need — hydrogen and nitrogen, which are major components of the manufacturing process,” he said.

“We are in the midst of identifying sources for those. And then there’s the port infrastructure, which is also a key factor.

“On our end, we are really focused on technical readiness and securing EIA clearance for this particular plant,” Sinha added.

Earlier in his speech, Nik Nazmi said the proposed SAF refinery in Port Klang will be a game-changer for Malaysia’s energy and aviation sectors.

“This investment will serve as a catalyst for far-reaching transformation across our energy and aviation sectors,” he said.

He said the project aligns with Malaysia’s climate goals under the Paris Agreement and reinforces the country’s position as a regional leader in the fast-growing Southeast Asian SAF market.

“Air travel is essential, but it must become sustainable.

“This refinery will help decarbonise the aviation sector while enhancing our energy security and supporting Malaysia’s net-zero aspirations,” he said.

Nik Nazmi also highlighted the project’s socio-economic value, saying it will create jobs and benefit communities involved in the biofuel supply chain.

“This project shows that sustainability and economic opportunity can go hand in hand,” he added.",https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/04/25/3283408.jpg,N,,2025-04-25 02:56:48.325527

The race to ramp up SAF

SAF forms the backbone of its strategy to reduce carbon emissions, but Wizz Air warns that supply remains scarce and costly – a particular challenge for low-cost carriers.

The airline said it is investing in SAF production and has signed offtake agreements, but called on strong policy support to accelerate progress.

“Governments must take action to scale SAF production by ensuring a long-term policy framework. and by introducing incentives that close the price gap between SAF and conventional jet fuel,” the airline said in a statement.

Calls for reform

Wizz Air, which is aiming to reduce emissions per passenger kilometre by 25% by 2030, further insisted that faster innovation is needed to prepare aircraft for higher SAF blends.

Additionally, it called for urgent reform of European airspace to reduce inefficient flight paths that generate millions of tonnes in unnecessary emissions annually.

“We need action, not just ambition.

In a move that sets the stage for environmentally conscious air travel, EVA Air has taken a sky-high leap towards sustainability. On April 24, 2025, the airline, renowned for its top-notch service and flair, announced a trio of game-changing agreements to secure sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from a trio of industry leaders: Associated Energy Group, LLC (AEG FUELS) hailing from the United States, Japan’s own COSMO Oil Marketing Co., Ltd., and Formosa Petrochemical Corporation from Taiwan. The new deals highlight EVA Air’s steadfast dedication to reducing the carbon footprint, nurturing a harmonious dance between environment and aviation, through both global and homegrown alliances.

“Sustainable development isn’t just something on our wishlist—it’s our duty,” emphasized EVA Air President, Clay Sun, echoing the spirit of commitment to net-zero emissions. By further broadening their SAF network globally, EVA Air is not merely flying the skies; it’s soaring above industry standards by revolutionizing the aviation supply chain.

Aligned perfectly with the global aspiration to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, SAF is becoming the linchpin of aviation’s decarbonization ambitions. EVA Air has already aligned with the European Union’s SAF mandates, operating flights from Europe featuring a notable 2% SAF blend since the dawn of 2025. Venturing into the second quarter of this very green year, the airline is poised to roll out SAF independently at strategic international nodal points scattered across North America, Japan, and Taiwan. This initiative promises to trim down operational emissions while galvanizing regional SAF integration.

The renowned threesome of SAF suppliers isn’t just for show—they each bring unique strengths to the table:

AEG FUELS puts forth a potent worldwide logistics network and adeptness in orchestrating fuel management solutions.

COSMO, an illustrious powerhouse in Japan’s energy sector, is prepping to fuel the Kansai region just in time for the Osaka-Kansai Japan Expo, which will run until the curtain closes in October 2025.

Formosa Petrochemical Corporation, trailblazing as Taiwan’s maiden SAF producer, fortifies local supply chains and highlights the crucial role of domestic production prowess.

In an eco-friendly crescendo to local sustainability, EVA Air introduced its first taste of locally brewed SAF on April 23, 2025, under the auspices of the Civil Aviation Administration’s pilot program. The blend debuted on two trailblazing international flights—BR156 took off from Taipei Songshan to Seoul Gimpo, and BR148 headed from Kaohsiung to Kansai International Airport. This landmark moment ushers in a new era of SAF utilization at Taiwan’s bustling airports, showcasing a fully prepped local supply line.

EVA Air isn’t just resting on its laurels; it paves the runway with a broader sustainability initiative that includes a shiny new fleet of fuel-miser aircraft like the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350-1000, alongside streamlined flight routes to further clip emissions. These green-minded endeavors, interwoven with SAF deployment, compose a sound symphony of environmental stewardship.

With eyes on the skies and a heartbeat for planet Earth, EVA Air is mapping out an expansive flight plan to amplify SAF usage, stand firm with global climate heroes, and bolster cooperation with industry stakeholders.

The renewable diesel segment, which consists of the Diamond Green Diesel joint venture, reported sales volumes of 2.43 million gallons per day during the first quarter, down from 3.73 million gallons per day during the first quarter of last year. Valero primarily attributed the decreased sale volumes to planned maintenance activities at the DGD St. Charles refinery in Louisiana.

According to Valero, the renewable diesel segment generated $493 million in revenues from external customers during the first quarter, including $391 million from renewable diesel, $39 million from renewable naphtha and $63 million from neat sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Total revenues for the segment reached $702 million during the first quarter of 2024, with $697 million attributed to renewable diesel and $23 million attributed to renewable naphtha. The segment did not begin producing SAF until late 2024.

The renewable diesel segment reported an operating loss of $141 million for the first quarter, compared to an operating income of $190 million for the same period of 2024. The decrease is attributed to reduced production volumes and feedstock costs.

During a first quarter earnings call, Valero Vice President of Investor Relations and Finance Homer Bhullar said the company currently expects sales volumes for the renewable diesel segment to be approximately 1.1 billion gallons for the full year 2025, reflecting lower production volumes due to economics.

The ethanol segment produced 4.47 million gallons per day during the first quarter of 2025, unchanged when compared to the same period of 2024.

(WCIA) — A team of researchers at the University of Illinois is working to create a more sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Now, these scientists have turned to a prairie grass to try and make it happen.

Switchgrass is native to North America, can grow in a variety of conditions and often reaches five or six feet in height. It can also be harvested annually — for a decade or more — without needing to be replanted. In 2021, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge began with the goal of expanding sustainable fuel production to 35 billion gallons by 2050. Switchgrass is just one of several kinds of materials that could meet this challenge.

Scientists have been studying the bioenergy potential of switchgrass for decades. Previous studies, however, used a less productive kind of switchgrass, used smaller amounts of land, or overlooked important fertilizer inputs.

In these two new studies, U of I researchers grew “energy” switchgrass at a larger scale to figure out which varieties of the grass are most profitable, where it’ll be most profitable to grow, and how it compares to corn in terms of ecosystem services.

“All the data that helps us estimate switchgrass suitability for SAF comes from small plot research or older forage-type switchgrass cultivars. We wanted to test high-yielding switchgrass cultivars on a larger scale to provide a more accurate picture of the benefits these new cultivars provide,” said DoKyoung Lee, senior author of both studies and professor in the Department of Crop Sciences, part of the College of ACES at the U of I.

Muhammad Umer Arshad, a postdoctoral researcher, led the team in analyzing the profitability in switchgrass. Three newer varieties of switchgrass were planted — Independence, Liberty, and Carthage — and two forage varieties were planted — Shawnee and Sunburst. The researchers planted the varieties on low-productivity land across four states, and tested nitrogen fertilizer rates. After five years, Arshad analyzed expenses and profits in each location.

“Our findings clearly show that Independence and Liberty are much more profitable than the forage cultivars on all the sites, but the most profitable nitrogen rate varied across locations,” Arshad said. “In most cases, 56 kilograms per hectare achieved higher yields, but in some sites, 28 kilograms performed better in terms of profit.”

The “energy” switchgrass outperformed the forage cultivars, but performed differently across the sites depending on the nitrogen rate.

“With these energy-type cultivars, farmers can put marginal lands to use and see returns after two years,” Arshad said. “Our results can help guide decision-makers to optimize input strategies for biomass production and meet renewable energy demands.”

Postdoctoral fellow Nictor Namoi led a companion study in field-scale plots in Illinois. Namoi assessed soil greenhouse gas emissions and nitrate leaching in Independence switchgrass. Then, Namoi compared the data to other field ecosystems with different crops.

“One of the many benefits of growing purpose-grown energy crops on marginal lands is ecosystem services associated with the perennial nature of energy crops. They can also potentially generate higher profits than conventional row crops on less productive land,” Namoi said. “Demonstrating ecosystem services of switchgrass, including reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient loss, will promote purpose-grown energy crops on marginal land.”

Namoi found that switchgrass had significantly lower levels of nitrous oxide emissions and nitrate leaching than corn. But carbon dioxide emissions after two years were higher in switchgrass than corn. Namoi pointed to higher levels of biomass below the ground in switchgrass than corn as a potential factor.

Despite this, Lee said the benefits of switchgrass still outweigh the cons.

“For one thing, more root biomass means more long-term carbon sequestration potential,” Lee said. “When we measure total biomass of switchgrass, there’s about 10 megagrams of carbon belowground. That’s huge.”

Another advantage of switchgrass lies in its ability to thrive on marginal land.

“By definition, marginal land is not profitable for commodity crops,” Namoi said. “So switchgrass reduces competition with food crops and makes use of otherwise unproductive areas.”",https://www.wcia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2025/04/lee_dokyoung220609-mh-02.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-04-24 19:56:56.933128

The ammonia cracker’s modular design is said to enable integration into both hybrid floating storage and regasification units (FSRUs) and dedicated floating hydrogen terminals.
The ammonia cracker was assembled at Sustainable Energy’s Norwegian Catapult Center in Stord, Norway.
Other partners in the project are the Institute for Energy Technology (IFE), University of South-East Norway, Sustainable Energy, and BASF SE.
Upon reaching the receiving destination, the ammonia cracker will convert the ammonia back to hydrogen for distribution into the local energy grid.","Wärtsilä Gas Solutions and Höegh Evi have completed development of what they claim is the first floating ammonia-to-hydrogen cracker.

The technology is designed to allow floating import terminals to produce hydrogen from transported ammonia. The ammonia cracker’s modular design is said to enable integration into both hybrid floating storage and regasification units (FSRUs) and dedicated floating hydrogen terminals.

In addition, the technology is scalable with an annual send-out capacity of up to 210,000 metric tons of hydrogen; ammonia storage capacities can range from 10,000 to 120,000 cu m.

To date, the project has attracted about EUR5.9 million ($6.71 million) in funding from the Norwegian government’s green platform program.

The ammonia cracker was assembled at Sustainable Energy’s Norwegian Catapult Center in Stord, Norway. Other partners in the project are the Institute for Energy Technology (IFE), University of South-East Norway, Sustainable Energy, and BASF SE.

Under the EU’s REPower strategy, there are plans for Europe to import 10 MMmt/year of renewable hydrogen by 2030. As a hydrogen grid emerges, floating infrastructure with ammonia cracking technology could open the way toward large-scale imports, supplying emission-intensive industries with a stable baseload energy source and balance within the energy system, the partners said.

Although hydrogen shows promise as a commercial and sustainable fuel, and can be produced for a relatively low investment cost in countries with plentiful access to renewable power, it is also difficult to store and transport. This is because of its low volumetric energy density with potentially large vaporisation losses.

Ammonia, however, can be stored in liquid form at moderate pressures and temperatures, and it is transported by ships over long distances. Upon reaching the receiving destination, the ammonia cracker will convert the ammonia back to hydrogen for distribution into the local energy grid.","https://img.offshore-mag.com/files/base/ebm/os/image/2025/04/680a5d5b068499aa952f85b7-warstila.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-04-24 21:57:29.384856

New market: Sustainable aviation fuel ... “Sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to be a massive market for corn,” Gould says, explaining that SAF can’t compete in the short term with petroleum jet fuel because it’s more expensive and its production is inefficient.","Can Corn Fuel Cars and Planes?

by Ava Splear (Farm Progress/Prairie Farmer) U.S. EPA announced year-round availability of E15 in seven states. Plus, new demand for ethanol is being developed through the sustainable aviation fuel market. -- o E15 has been approved for year-round availability in seven states throughout the Midwest. o Many airline companies are pledging to switch to sustainable aviation fuel, which will increase long-term demand for corn. o Illinois is a strong contender to be a hub for SAF production.

What if you could grow corn, drive a truck powered by ethanol and fly a plane with corn-based fuel? For Maple Park, Ill., farmer and FedEx pilot Chris Gould, that could actually happen.

“It would be cool to be burning the product I’m growing,” says Gould, who also serves as an Illinois Corn Growers Association director.

The possibility is not far off, he says, pointing to several new developments in legislation, facilities, company pledges and sustainability goals that are driving change in corn’s future as a renewable energy source. Farming — and flying — from the heart of the Corn Belt, Gould has a front-row seat.

Changes to E15 legislation

Earlier this year, U.S. EPA announced that E15 will be available year-round for seven states — Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin — starting April 28. Prior to this, EPA had to issue a waiver for pumps in those states to offer E15 from June through September.

...

Legislation for year-round availability is ideal, and Gould is optimistic that the change can happen because E15 has bipartisan support.

E15 previously required a waiver to be sold during summer months because it doesn’t meet Reid Vapor Pressure requirements under the Clean Air Act. Ethanol emissions increase during the summer months due to higher temperatures. According to the Congressional Research Service, seven consecutive fuel waivers have been signed, meaning that E15 has been available year-round for the last seven years in those seven states.

...

New market: Sustainable aviation fuel

...

“Sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to be a massive market for corn,” Gould says, explaining that SAF can’t compete in the short term with petroleum jet fuel because it’s more expensive and its production is inefficient. It takes about 1.6 gallons of ethanol to produce 1 gallon of SAF. However, with time and continued research to build the SAF industry, eventually it will become more competitive and beneficial to corn farmers.

Still, it is possible to use SAF as a jet fuel alternative now. In the European Union, there are already mandates in place for using SAF in small quantities.

...

At the Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Beyond Conference in March, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines both pledged to replace 10% of their fuel usage with SAF by 2030. For American Airlines, this means it would need 400 million gallons of SAF to reach the pledged 10% in a single year.

And United Airlines? The company pledges to be net-zero by 2050, which means using all SAF. According to United, the SAF it uses “has up to 85% lower greenhouse gas emissions than regular jet fuel.”

...

“There are a couple technologies right now that are being developed to commercialize the production of sustainable aviation fuel,” says Brad Stotler, director of government affairs at IL Corn.

Illinois makes a good spot to house this new industry because of the large supply of corn and a strong transportation infrastructure, including nine international airports and all Class I railroads touching the state. In addition, a large amount of research is conducted at educational institutions across the state, and a tax credit in Illinois makes it more economically feasible.

“We have existing refiners and other companies looking to locate near our ethanol industry to produce sustainable aviation fuel product,” Stotler says.

Leveraging growth in Africa’s’ aviation sector

With Africa’s air transport market poised for significant growth Boeing has forecast that around 1,200 new commercial aircraft will be required over the next 20 years to meet the continent’s growing air connectivity needs and drive its socioeconomic transformation. Boeing currently represents around 70% of the in-service fleet across the continent and to help maintain its footprint in the African market, the OEM has officially opened its new office in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. The opening marks the OEM’s second office on the continent with a statement from Boeing saying it “will enhance our ability to serve our airline customers and partners across the continent reinforcing our commitment to the region’s growing aerospace industry and building on our 75-year legacy in Africa.”

According to Ethiopia’s Minister of Transport and Logistics, Alemu Sime, the opening of Boeing’s African office in Addis Ababa “highlights Ethiopia’s increasing importance in global aviation and supports the wider aspiration for a connected and thriving Africa.”

Henok Teferra Shawl, Boeing Africa’s managing director added that he was delighted to welcome Abderahmane Berthe, Secretary-General of the African Airlines Association (AAFRA) as the first guest at the new office to discuss a partnership to support growth of aviation, availing of safety training for airlines and the production and deployment of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in Africa.

Supported by a broad coalition of labor and industry leaders, environmental advocates, and consumer groups(opens in a new tab), the Governor’s commonsense energy plan will create jobs, lower costs for consumers, speed up permitting, and protect Pennsylvania from global instability by building more energy generation in Pennsylvania – positioning the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come.

Last month at Voith Hydro in York(opens in a new tab), one of the world’s largest hydropower manufacturing facilities, Governor Shapiro launched the legislative push for his Lightning Plan. The plan includes a proposal – supported by both Republicans and Democrats – to update the Pennsylvania Economic Development for a Growing Economy (EDGE) Tax Credit, which was established in 2022, but hasn’t been used, leaving billions in potential economic development untapped. Governor Shapiro also highlighted key components of the plan while visiting Penn England Farms in Blair County(opens in a new tab), where a methane digester is turning farm waste into clean energy, cutting electricity costs, and generating revenue. The Lightning Plan will expand access to shared digesters to help more farmers benefit.

In January, Governor Shapiro first unveiled the Lightning Plan at Pittsburgh International Airport(opens in a new tab), highlighting a $1.5 billion hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel project creating 3,000 construction jobs. This week, the Governor also announced(opens in a new tab) that federal regulators have approved his new agreement with PJM Interconnection to deliver $21 billion in consumer savings over the next two years, lowering household energy bills and protecting Pennsylvania ratepayers.

By producing more energy, cutting red tape, and advancing innovation, Governor Shapiro’s Lightning Plan will boost key sectors of the Commonwealth’s economy, including manufacturing, robotics and technology, agriculture, and life sciences. Independent studies(opens in a new tab) confirm that the Governor’s plan will save Pennsylvanians money on their electricity bills, create energy jobs, and lead to billions in new investment in power plants and energy infrastructure.

“Pennsylvania has long been a national energy leader, from Ben Franklin to today, but right now, we’re letting other states outcompete us and we’re losing out on jobs, new investment, and innovation – that has to change,” said Governor Shapiro. “My energy plan will power Pennsylvania forward by incentivizing the building of next generation energy projects in the Commonwealth. We have to meet this moment and this plan – supported by leaders from the energy industry, organized labor and environmental groups, and consumer advocates – will lower costs for consumers, create more jobs, speed up permitting, and position the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come. The time for action is now and I look forward to working with leaders in the General Assembly to continue moving this legislation forward.”

Governor Shapiro’s energy plan will provide funding for new projects through an updated EDGE manufacturing tax credit, streamline energy project approvals by creating a state energy siting board to cut red tape, and encourage communities to lower utility bills through shared energy resources. Additionally, the plan increases rebates for energy-efficient appliances to help reduce household energy costs. The Lightning Plan will supercharge energy development in the Commonwealth, positioning Pennsylvania to lead the way in clean, reliable, and affordable energy for years to come.

New studies from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign identify economic and environmental considerations that make switchgrass a candidate for sustainable aviation fuel.

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge kicked off in 2021 with the goal of expanding SAF production to 35 billion gallons by 2050, while cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half. Forecasted to contribute up to 230 million dry tonnes annually, switchgrass is one of several purpose-grown bioenergy feedstocks that could help meet this challenge.

Not only does the perennial species produce great quantities of biomass, switchgrass can be harvested annually for a decade or more without repeated planting, requires minimal nitrogen fertilizer compared to corn, and performs important ecosystem services.

Scientists know this because they have been studying switchgrass for its bioenergy potential for decades. But previous studies used less productive switchgrass cultivars, were conducted on smaller and less realistic plots of land, or overlooked the fertilizer inputs required for optimal productivity.

In two new studies, U. of I. researchers grew modern ""energy"" cultivars at the field scale across the Midwest to determine which cultivars are most profitable where, and how they compare to corn in terms of ecosystem services. The articles were published in GCB Bioenergy and Journal of Environmental Quality.

""All the data that helps us estimate switchgrass suitability for SAF comes from small plot research or older forage-type switchgrass cultivars. We wanted to test high-yielding switchgrass cultivars on a larger scale to provide a more accurate picture of the benefits these new cultivars provide,"" said DoKyoung Lee, senior author of both studies and professor in the Department of Crop Sciences, part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences at U. of I.

Postdoctoral researcher Muhammad Umer Arshad led the effort to analyze switchgrass profitability. The team planted three newer energy-type cultivars—Independence, Liberty, and Shawnee—alongside two forage cultivars—Carthage and Sunburst—on low-productivity marginal land across four Midwestern states: Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota. They also tested two nitrogen fertilizer rates, 28 and 56 kilograms per hectare; for comparison, corn typically gets about 200. After five years of growth, Arshad conducted economic analyses to calculate expenses and profits in each location.

""Our findings clearly show that Independence and Liberty are much more profitable than the forage cultivars on all the sites, but the most profitable nitrogen rate varied across locations,"" Arshad said. ""In most cases, 56 kilograms per hectare achieved higher yields, but in some sites, 28 kilograms performed better in terms of profit.""

Although Independence and Liberty outperformed the forage cultivars, these energy types of switchgrass did not perform equally across the sites. For example, depending on the nitrogen rate, Independence was most profitable in U.S. hardiness zone 6a, whereas Liberty showed the highest profit margins in zone 5b. One forage type, Carthage, was most profitable in zone 4b.

""With these energy-type cultivars, farmers can put marginal lands to use and see returns after two years,"" Arshad said. ""Our results can help guide decision-makers to optimize input strategies for biomass production and meet renewable energy demands.""

During the decade or so that switchgrass is churning out biomass, it's also busy providing ecosystem services—a win-win, according to postdoctoral fellow Nictor Namoi, who led a companion study in field-scale plots in Illinois.

Namoi assessed soil greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide) and nitrate leaching in Independence switchgrass over three years, and compared these metrics to other fields planted in continuous corn under no-till management.

""The industry is trying to move away from corn toward more purpose-grown energy crops, but with current commodity prices, switchgrass can't compete with corn,"" Namoi said. ""So how can we promote widespread adoption? We have to look at ecosystem services. The idea with this study was to compare ecosystem services for these two cropping systems on equal footing.""

Nitrous oxide emissions and nitrate leaching were significantly reduced in switchgrass compared to corn, with 80% less nitrate leaching by the third year. Namoi says the nitrous oxide finding is straightforward: with switchgrass getting just 56 kilograms of nitrogen fertilizer per hectare and corn receiving 202 kilograms, there's a lot more nitrogen available in corn fields to be emitted as the potent greenhouse gas.

Carbon dioxide emissions were less straightforward. After the second year, CO2 emissions were over 50% higher in switchgrass than in corn.

""I wasn't expecting that,"" Namoi said. ""But there's a lot more biomass belowground in switchgrass, about five times that of corn.""

More roots mean more respiration, the normal process in which roots convert oxygen and glucose into energy, with carbon dioxide as a byproduct. Lee says he's seen this pattern with switchgrass and other purpose-grown bioenergy crops before, but he's still convinced that the overall benefits of switchgrass outweigh this particular deficit.

""For one thing, more root biomass means more long-term carbon sequestration potential,"" he said. ""When we measure total biomass of switchgrass, there's about 10 megagrams of carbon belowground. That's huge.""

Another key advantage of switchgrass, Namoi added, is its ability to thrive on marginal land.

""By definition, marginal land is not profitable for commodity crops,"" he said. ""So switchgrass reduces competition with food crops and makes use of otherwise unproductive areas.""

With commodity and oil prices at a low point, the demand for purpose-grown bioenergy feedstocks is relatively weak at the moment. But that could all change rapidly as tariffs impact global economies. Namoi says when the market is ready, switchgrass will be, too.

""Our research ensures that we can feed productive cultivars into the SAF production system once the economy and the technology is ready to transition,"" he said.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2019/prairiegrass.jpg,N,,2025-04-24 12:56:42.884252

“We are committed to be the best-in-class partner to provide innovative solutions and support farmers’ efforts in low-carbon agriculture,” said Julio Garros, co-president, Agribusiness, at Bunge. “Through industry collaborations, we are adding new oil sources to our global supply chains and investing in processing plants with greater ability to handle and process these crops, expanding our offerings of cost-effective, sustainable feedstocks to customers worldwide. We are pleased to partner with Repsol to create clear and scalable paths to support the decarbonization of the industry.”

St. Louis, Missouri, US-based Bunge said it is leveraging its extensive global network of farmer relationships and expertise in oilseed processing, developing value-chain partnerships to promote the adoption of intermediate novel crops and offering a progressive portfolio of readily available, high-performing options.

These oil-rich novel crops, which are designed to be planted on fallow lands, offer distinct advantages: provide farmers a new income opportunity through sustainable crop rotations while improving soil health and boosting biodiversity, Bunge noted. Moreover, these crops are additive to the existing production systems for food, feed and fuel.

Bunge and Repsol recently closed their partnership transaction, which was announced in March 2024, and said they are committed to ongoing research and development to explore further low-carbon feedstock opportunities to boost the supply of advanced renewable fuels, including sourcing novel seeds from Spanish farmers.

Described as the first of its kind in Europe, this partnership was developed to accelerate the ramp-up of production of these fuels mandated by the European Union. As part of the agreement, Repsol Repsol acquired 40% of three industrial facilities that are part of Bunge Iberica, one of Bunge’s subsidiaries in the Iberian Peninsula, and dedicated to the production of oils and biofuels.

“Renewable fuels are a fundamental pillar for Repsol on our road to becoming zero net emissions by 2050, and intermediate crops must play a key role in guaranteeing the supply of the low-carbon feedstocks necessary to produce these fuels,” said Juan Abascal, executive managing director of Industrial Transformation and Circular Economy at Repsol. “Our strategic alliance with Bunge, a world leader in the vegetable oils production sector, strengthens our capacity to achieve our shared vision of decarbonizing industry and mobility in the most efficient way.”",https://www.world-grain.com/ext/resources/2023/10/17/Ethanol_biofuels_SCHARFSINN86---STOCK.ADOBE.COM_e.jpg?height=635&t=1713795330&width=1200,N,,2025-04-24 11:57:16.915571

Most of these approaches generate acyclic hydrocarbons that offer high gravimetric net heats of combustion (NHOC) and good combustion properties, but much lower densities than petroleum-based diesel fuel. To address this shortcoming, biosynthetic farnesene was isomerized with a heterogeneous acid catalyst (Amberlyst-15) under mild conditions and hydrogenated to generate a complex mixture of acyclic, monocyclic, bicyclic, and tricyclic hydrocarbons. The hydrogenated farnesene isomers (HFI) had a density of 0.852 g mL–1, a gravimetric NHOC of 43.33 MJ kg–1, a 40 °C kinematic viscosity of 3.25 mm2 s–1, and a derived cetane number (DCN) of 40. All of these values are similar to or exceed those of diesel fuel derived from petroleum sources. Compared to farnesane, the direct hydrogenation product of farnesene, HFI exhibited 11% higher density and 9% higher volumetric NHOC due to the cyclic compounds contained in the mixture. 10–40% blends of HFI with conventional jet fuel were prepared and exhibited −20 °C kinematic viscosities ranging from 4.8–7.8 mm2 s–1, which fall within the specification for Jet-A (<8.0 mm2 s–1).

The facility will continue to produce ethylene from a newer steam cracker. Investment will also be refocused on the facility’s decarbonization.

The older cracker has relied on a third-party consumer, which recently decided to end the contract by 2027. “As a result, the steam cracker, which is not integrated to TotalEnergies' downstream polymer production, will no longer have any outlets for its ethylene production”, the French integrated energy company said in an online statement.

“The unit shutdown will allow the site to focus on its more recent steam cracker, whose ethylene production is entirely consumed by TotalEnergies' industrial units in Antwerp and Feluy”.

The shutdown will not result in layoffs. “The 253 employees concerned will each be offered a solution aligned with their personal situation: retirement or an internal transfer to another position based at the Antwerp site”, the statement said. “This project is subject to the legally required employee consultation and notification process, which TotalEnergies will initiate with representatives of Antwerp platform employees in late April”.

The facility, on the other hand, will this year enable a conventional refining unit to co-process biomass to produce 50,000 metric tons a year of sustainable aviation fuel. This will be supplied to aviation customers, TotalEnergies said.

Meanwhile as part of the facility’s decarbonization TotalEnergies has signed a tolling deal for 130 megawatts (MW) from a 200-MW electrolyzer project of Air Liquide. That secures 15,000 metric tons per annum of green hydrogen for the Antwerp complex.

“Upstream of the electrolyzer, TotalEnergies will supply green electricity thanks to its OranjeWind offshore wind project”, TotalEnergies added. “Scheduled for the end of 2027, the project will reduce CO2 [carbon dioxide] emissions at the Antwerp site by up to 150,000 tons per year and contribute to the European targets (RED III) for renewable energy in transport”.

Moreover the facility’s electrification and battery energy storage are “contributing respectively to the decarbonization of its industrial operations and to the growing need to balance Belgian and European high-voltage transmission grids”, TotalEnergies said. “With a power rating of 25 MW and capacity of 75 MWh [megawatt hours], Antwerp’s battery storage system is TotalEnergies’ biggest in Europe”. The storage system was commissioned last year.

David O'Brien, who also leads Lauda Europe, said Malta and other peripheral states like Ireland and Cyprus are being unfairly penalised by EU climate policies that fail to account for their geographic realities.

“We are sleepwalking into a protectionist trap. Current EU policies punish states on the periphery for their geography. Our options are limited. We can’t holiday by road. Aviation is our lifeline, and it's being priced out,” he said.

The CEO was speaking at a joint panel hosted by the Malta Business Network (MBN) and the Irish Business Network (IBN) - the first event jointly organised by the two

O’Brien called on national governments, including Malta, to push back against policies that unfairly burden smaller, island-based nations.

He also criticised the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate, saying airlines operating out of Malta are often being charged for SAF even when airports don’t supply it.

“We land in Munich—no SAF available—but we’re still charged. These costs are staggering. The reality is, margins in aviation are wafer-thin, and these new charges may push us over the edge,” he said.

O'Brien's concerns were echoed by other panellists and leading aviation sector figures who spoke at the event.

KM Malta Airlines Executive Chairman David Curmi agreed that Malta faced significant challenges for the future of its connectivity.

The main airlines operating to and from the country, he said, face serious pressure from rising operational costs—many of them policy-driven.

“Destinations like Tel Aviv and St. Petersburg were cut for strategic reasons, but we’re increasingly having to make decisions based on cost pressure, not opportunity. It’s becoming harder to justify routes when the cost of doing business keeps escalating,” Curmi said.

Beyond the EU, panellists also expressed frustration at the lack of strategic planning and foresight from Malta’s own government.

There was a shared sentiment that the country’s approach to long-term connectivity and sustainable growth remains reactive and politically cautious.

Stephen Xuereb, CEO of Valletta Cruise Port, pointed out the growing disconnect between regulatory ambition and practical implementation, especially in infrastructure.

“There’s a lot of talk about sustainability, but not enough investment to match it. We’re expected to meet green targets, but where’s the support to actually get there?” he asked, referencing the cruise industry's growing compliance demands and Malta’s limited infrastructure to support them.

The event was moderated by David Delicata, Partner and Transportation, Hospitality & Services Leader at Deloitte Malta.

“Peripheral economies must be part of the policy conversation—not just policy recipients. Malta needs to lead, not follow, if we want a tourism sector that’s future-ready,” Delicata said.

Fluff pulp is a specialized type of chemical pulp made from softwood trees, prized for its high absorbency and bulk.
A Shifting Fluff Pulp Market: Rationalization or Trend?
The closure of International Paper’s Georgetown mill, which represented approximately 5% of US fluff pulp production, has sparked renewed interest in the underlying drivers of change within the fluff pulp sector.
Looking Ahead at Future Fluff Pulp Supply According to FisherSolve’s Capacity Trends module, no new fluff pulp mills have been announced anywhere in the world.","In a move that has drawn attention across the pulp and paper industry, International Paper (IP) announced the closure of its Georgetown, South Carolina mill in late 2024. The mill, which specialized in fluff pulp production, was a key player in the global supply chain for absorbent hygiene materials. Its closure raises important questions about the evolving dynamics of the fluff pulp market and whether this signals a broader shift for producers and end-users alike.

According to International Paper, the decision was part of a company-wide strategy to streamline operations and focus on more profitable assets. While internal cost and efficiency considerations played a role, industry professionals are questioning if this move also reflects deeper structural changes. These could include moderating demand growth, intensifying global competition, and the emergence of more cost-effective production regions.

What Is Fluff Pulp Used For?

Fluff pulp is a specialized type of chemical pulp made from softwood trees, prized for its high absorbency and bulk. It is primarily used in the production of absorbent hygiene products, including:

Baby diapers

Adult incontinence products

Feminine hygiene pads

Air-laid nonwovens for applications like wipes and medical pads

These products rely on fluff pulp's unique fiber structure to deliver critical performance in absorbency and fluid retention. The hygiene sector, especially in emerging markets, has traditionally driven demand growth for fluff pulp.

A Shifting Fluff Pulp Market: Rationalization or Trend?

The closure of International Paper’s Georgetown mill, which represented approximately 5% of US fluff pulp production, has sparked renewed interest in the underlying drivers of change within the fluff pulp sector. While it might be tempting to view this move as part of a larger market correction due to factors such as oversupply, the data suggests a different story. The shutdown is more accurately seen as a strategic decision tied to cost optimization and shifting corporate priorities rather than a response to excess global capacity.

Contrary to the notion of global oversupply, fluff pulp capacity has remained relatively stable over the past decade. The US continues to dominate production, much as it did 10 years ago. While Latin America and Asia have seen some growth—about 400,000 tons/year and 150,000 tons/year respectively—these increases are modest and have not meaningfully disrupted global pricing or market share. In fact, the production increase in Asia over the entire past decade is only about half the annual output of the Georgetown mill itself.

Instead, the closure underscores a confluence of evolving cost structures and operational realities:

Operational Cost Pressures: North American mills, particularly older sites like Georgetown, face growing challenges from energy costs, labor, and environmental compliance. According to FisherSolve’s Viability Index, Georgetown ranked among the highest-risk fluff pulp mills based on cost position and technical age—underscoring how these factors can make such facilities less competitive compared to newer or more strategically located mills.

Fluff Pulp Mill Viability by Cost and Technical Age (3Q2024)

Source: FisherSolve, Viability Index

Shifting Demand Optimization: While demand for hygiene products—diapers, adult incontinence items, and feminine care—remains strong, manufacturers are increasingly refining how they use fluff pulp. The adoption of advanced superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) and product redesigns have modestly reduced the volume of fluff required per unit, especially in mature markets.

Environmental and Efficiency Standards: Sustainability is no longer optional. Older facilities with higher water usage, energy intensity, or emissions profiles are increasingly difficult to justify in a market where ESG pressures are mounting.

Looking Ahead at Future Fluff Pulp Supply

According to FisherSolve’s Capacity Trends module, no new fluff pulp mills have been announced anywhere in the world. The only expected change is a forecasted production increase at International Paper’s Riegelwood mill in 2026. This suggests that while total capacity may edge upward in specific locations, there is no sign of a boom in new supply.

In this context, the Georgetown closure appears less like the start of a widespread contraction and more like a strategic pruning of less competitive assets. The industry may be entering a phase of consolidation and selective investment rather than dramatic shifts in overall supply.

Leveraging Market Intelligence to Stay Ahead

As the industry navigates strategic shifts like the Georgetown mill closure, companies across the pulp, paper, and hygiene value chains need reliable, data-driven tools to make informed decisions. ResourceWise’s FisherSolve platform delivers a comprehensive view of global market dynamics—covering production assets, cost structures, sustainability metrics, and long-term capacity trends.

One of the platform’s key capabilities, the Viability Index, flagged Georgetown as a high-risk mill before its closure—based on its cost position and technical age.

A Reputation Score is calculated separately for traditional media, social media and audience research, and then combined.
Notably, in the UK, airline reputation scores were not found to directly align with the volume of media coverage.
Exploring social media When looking into social media activity throughout 2024, there appears to be very little crossover between the top news coverage and social media posts.
Conclusion This review of airline reputation sets out a roadmap for airlines, identifying the six key pillars on which an airline reputation is built.","Brand reputation is more important than ever in today’s digital, interconnected age. The ability for information to spread online (accurate or not), is becoming unstoppable. Consequently, a company’s actions, whether they involve harmful, unethical, or unsustainable practices, or proactive measures such as taking bold steps to protect the planet, or unveiling innovations to enhance services, hold significant weight.

And often, the perception of these actions is even more important. The power and influence of both traditional media and social media have significantly amplified the impact of both positive and negative information, shaping public perception in real-time.

As airlines are responsible for the safe transportation of millions of passengers daily, trust and reliability are paramount. Therefore, for the airline industry, maintaining a solid and positive reputation couldn’t be more crucial.

While safety concerns underpin much of the consumer perceptions of airlines, reputation in this sector is a complex equation. And as the aviation industry continues to grow and evolve, several additional criteria are creeping into the equation. Notably, sustainability and accessibility are growing in importance.

In an era where environmental consciousness and inclusive travel are paramount, airlines are increasingly judged on their efforts to reduce their carbon footprint and ensure equitable access for all passengers. An airline’s products and services have the most influence on passengers.

Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) has partnered with Carma, a media analysis and intelligence service provider, to investigate how cabin design and passenger experience can impact an airline’s reputation.

Methodology

Carma employs a comprehensive approach to gauging reputation, analysing media coverage, social media activity, and audience perception through six pillars: products/services, sustainability, conduct, vision, performance, and culture.

A Reputation Score is calculated separately for traditional media, social media and audience research, and then combined. The score for each component is composed by weighting the presence of the six pillars with the tone and volume of coverage/respondents, which is then weighted by the importance of each pillar to the audience (based on audience research).

The research also provides insights into how reputation impacts purchasing decisions differently across various regions. For instance, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and United Arab Emirates (UAE), reputation is a strong driver of airline choice, while in Asia, purchase decisions are more complex. In the UK, reputation and purchasing decisions are often more separate considerations.

For the purpose of this report, stories and posts have been tracked regarding 12 airlines across 8 different countries, over the course of one year (2024). In total, the analysis considered 55,267 articles and 1,014,058 social media posts.

Driving airline reputation

So what factors are truly driving reputation in the airline industry? Carma has created a unique methodology to track reputation, based on its six key pillars:

Products and Services: Anything related to the airline’s customer offering, such as quality, reliability and customer service.

Culture: Anything related to the airline’s organisational culture, such as employee treatment, health & safety, diversity & inclusion.

Sustainability: Anything related to the airline’s sustainability actions including community engagement, environmental impact, and charitable endeavours.

Conduct: Anything related to the airline’s behaviour and conduct, such as authenticity, transparency, compliance, and ethical behaviour.

Performance: Anything related to the airline’s business performance, such as consistency, investment potential, and financial results.

Vision: Anything related to the airline’s direction and vision of the future, such as innovation, value proposition, and expertise.

Analysis of the perceptions of 1,534 people based in the UK, UAE, KSA, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore, found that Products and Services was the most influential factor in shaping people’s perception of an airline. Similarly, the study showed that Products and Services was also the biggest driver of coverage, accounting for 70% of traditional media and 65% of social media posts.

Carma also found that Products and Services was a more influential category than Conduct, Performance or Culture. This suggests that by continuing to offer new and innovative services onboard, airlines can maintain or even improve their reputation, helping to influence purchasing decisions.

Regional variations

Carma also found notable variations in how different regions value reputational factors. Notably, in the UK, airline reputation scores were not found to directly align with the volume of media coverage. For instance, Emirates received the best overall score in the region, despite a relatively low amount of traditional media coverage.

Whereas British Airways, despite having the lowest reputation score, was rated the highest in terms of likelihood of usage. This indicates the need for a greater and more positive exposure of BA’s products and services in the media to strengthen its brand reputation.

Meanwhile, in Asia, Singapore Airlines stood out from the pack as the most reputable airline. Notably, the airline scored highly in the Products and Services category, reinforcing the importance of this pillar. However, reputation again wasn’t found to be the most important factor in terms of likelihood of usage. Despite being rated as the most reputable airline, Singapore Airlines was only rated third for likelihood of usage.

Finally, in the UAE and KSA, Carma’s report found that the Middle East-based airlines received the most positivity from the media and audiences. Unsurprisingly, Emirates led the way with the highest reputation score, but was closely followed by Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways, and Saudia. Similarly to the other regions, the top airlines in terms of reputation also scored highly in Products and Services.

Given the importance of Products and Services on airline reputation score, investing in new and innovative onboard experiences will be essential for airlines moving forward. For airlines looking to bolster their interior products, services and onboard offering, Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) remains the event to attend.

As the world’s leading platform for airlines and cabin interiors professionals, AIX showcases products from all aspects of the cabin, from lighting, seating, galley equipment, and LEDs, to cabin management systems, IFEC hardware, and communications.

Aviation’s sustainability challenge: navigating expectations

Many consumers are aware of aviation’s impact on the environment, and look to fly with airlines that prioritise making sustainable choices and continually improvements. A recent survey from an international aerospace company found that 65% of respondents believe it is time for sustainable air travel. The survey found that 70% of all respondents from across the UK, US, France and Germany are concerned about the role of aviation in climate change.

But what does the media landscape look like when it comes to airline sustainability news? Over the course of 2024, Carma (which analysed over 55,000 articles in the mainstream media) identified six key spikes in activity.

The data showed that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) dominated much of the media coverage when it comes to sustainable aviation stories. However, in reality, the landscape for this is much larger. Though SAF is certainly part of the narrative, many airlines are taking significant steps to reduce their carbon emissions and minimise their impact on the environment through sustainable aircraft interiors.

The coverage suggests that there is a huge window of opportunity for airlines to gain a competitive advantage by promoting and generating wider awareness of other sustainability initiatives, whether that be the introduction of lightweight seating, or the use of more recycled materials on-board.

Key media moments in 2024:

09 April: Sustainability was listed as “one of the most pressing issues in aviation” ahead of the 2024 Future Aviation Forum.

03 June: The need to switch to sustainable aviation fuel was highlighted as a key cost to factor in for airlines as demand recovers from Covid-19.

25 June: There was a wave of coverage after Lufthansa, Europe’s biggest airline group, announced it would introduce a surcharge of up to €72 per flight in 2025 to cover the costs of switching to alternative fuels necessary to lower emissions.

07 August: Virgin Atlantic was the subject of significant (largely negative) media coverage after its fuel advert was banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), which ruled it to be “misleading”.

18 September: Climate technology firm, Air Company, announced that it had secured backing from aviation fuel supplier, Avfuel, in its latest funding round as it looks to convert carbon dioxide into more climate-friendly products.

31 October: There was a spike in news coverage when China-based airline, Xiamen Airlines won the APEX World-Class Airline award, and the company cited ‘Caring for the Earth’ as one of its three core pillars.

Now let’s take a closer look at the news coverage. Excluding sustainable aviation fuel, if we break down the coverage, we can see that:

Collaborations were another significant driver of sustainability coverage, making up 32% of articles.

Events were the focus of 16% of all sustainability articles.

Greenwashing only accounted for 2% of all sustainability articles.

Additionally, if we examine the statistics for sentiment around sustainability news coverage overall, we can see that:

Positive coverage accounted for 53%

Neutral coverage accounted for 25%

Negative coverage accounted for 22%

In terms of geographical distribution, Carma’s data showed that (out of the areas analysed) the top five countries for sustainability coverage included:

UK coverage accounted for 37%

US coverage accounted for 36%

United Arab Emirates coverage accounted for 18%

Singapore coverage accounted for 6%

Malaysia coverage accounted for 4%

Looking at the news coverage in more detail, it is clear that partnerships were very effective at boosting sustainability messaging. Some of the most notable examples of stories in 2024 included:

24 January: Lufthansa Group chose Viasat to install the European Aviation Network (EAN) in-flight connectivity solution.

The articles specifically highlighted how the EAN allows Lufthansa Group to both save money and be more sustainable on its flights because of its ‘small, low weight, low-drag terminals’.

01 May: Turkish Airlines, Airbus and Rolls-Royce entered into a partnership for workforce and innovation.

01 October: Qatar Airways Group announced plans to acquire a minority 25% equity stake in Virgin Australia.

This is an interesting example as the focus isn’t solely on sustainability, but is linked to it largely by spokespeople quoted in the articles.

It is worth noting that in much of the partnership news, sustainability wasn’t the crux of the story. However, as explained above, the sustainability messaging was boosted through spokesperson quotes, indicating the importance of maximising these opportunities for airlines.

Greenwashing was a theme throughout the year, but it did not penetrate news coverage all that widely, appearing in only 2% of all sustainability coverage. Notably, the stories did translate into social media activity in a way other sustainability topics did not. A key example of this was an announcement from the EU it would be investigating 20 carriers for potential ‘greenwashing’. Data from Carma also indicated that the US is more engaged with the topic of greenwashing than any other country.

Exploring social media

When looking into social media activity throughout 2024, there appears to be very little crossover between the top news coverage and social media posts. The lack of continuity between the platforms suggests a potential window of opportunity for airlines to drive further traction in sharing their sustainability stories on social media. From a reputation perspective, there is more that could be done to drive these new stories and translate them into positive conversations on social media.

Spotlighting sustainable cabin interiors

Despite a complex media landscape, airlines across the globe are increasingly investing in a variety of products, strategies and initiatives which are helping to reduce their environmental impact. However, given the data at hand, it seems that many of the top stories are consistently neglecting to mention some of the most innovative strategies for reducing carbon emissions inside the cabin. Sustainable aircraft interiors are a particularly un-reported area in the media.

Some of the most common themes, products and strategies being employed in sustainable aircraft interiors include lightweighting. For airlines, this involves the process of reducing the overall weight of the aircraft, its components and materials, primarily through the use of lighter materials and optimised designs to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. There are a number of different methods of lightweighting, which include lighter weight paint, aircraft seating, galleys, and flooring.

Despite the topic of sustainable aviation gaining significant traction in the media, it is clear that an important segment within sustainability – cabin interiors – is going underrepresented in the news. The aircraft interiors industry is tackling the challenge of sustainability in a variety of ways, which are not being reported on in any great detail in the mainstream national or business media. However, these solutions are being invested in, and they are helping to drive the future of aviation through the medium of sustainable interiors.

Accessibility in aviation: a growing imperative

For airlines, sustainability is not the only ethical concern that they must address. In recent years, discussions around inclusivity and accessibility in aviation have significantly intensified. This growing focus is driven by a greater awareness of the diverse needs of passengers and increasing pressure from a range of industry stakeholders, including affected passengers and their advocates.

Slowly but surely, this pressure is leading to change within the industry. This growing focus also aligns with the importance of the Conduct pillar in airline reputation – the second most important factor – as it underlines the significance of how airlines manage their relationships with passengers. Accessibility accounts for 1.2% of airline coverage, and 2% of social media posts.

Airlines are increasingly recognising that accessibility is a crucial factor, intrinsically linked to their conduct. There is a growing demand for airlines to adapt and innovate to meet the evolving expectations of all passengers, including those with physical disabilities, limited mobility, non-visible disabilities, and neurodiverse differences. This is driving investment in training, infrastructure and technology, to ensure a more equitable and comfortable travel experience, demonstrating a commitment to treating all passengers with fairness and respect.

But what does the media landscape look like around accessibility in aviation? Exploring the data for sentiment around accessibility news coverage, we can see that differs significantly from sustainability, with the vast majority of articles having a neutral sentiment:

Neutral coverage accounted for 61%

Positive coverage accounted for 30%

Negative coverage accounted for 9%

In terms of geographical distribution, Carma’s data found that (out of the countries analysed) the top five countries for accessibility coverage included:

UK coverage accounted for 43%

US coverage accounted for 37%

United Arab Emirates coverage accounted for 11%

French coverage accounted for 6%

Saudi Arabian coverage accounted for 3%

According to data from the Carma platform, the biggest spike in reporting was on the 26th September, as major airline, Virgin Atlantic, announced it would be stepping up its efforts to help deaf and hard-of-hearing travellers, with initiatives including special training for more of its crew.

The story was widely reported across UK publications – with 197 total articles on this in a single day. An important factor in the widespread coverage can likely be attributed to the airline partnering with deaf Gladiators star Jodie Ounsley, and deaf twins and content creators, Hermon and Heroda Berhane.

This collaboration not only put a human face to the airline’s accessibility initiatives, but also amplified the message through the reach and influence of these popular public figures, demonstrating the positive impact of working closely with disabled people, and ensuring greater visibility for the story.

While Virgin’s story gained the greatest traction in the media, there were a number of other stories less widely reported, which shared important updates on the state of accessibility in the airline industry. It is worth noting that the stories around airline accessibility for passengers with physical disabilities or limited mobility were generally more widely covered than the stories discussing accessible changes for neurodiverse passengers or those with invisible disabilities. Another point to observe is that these stories were picked up largely by the aviation and aircraft interiors trade media, as opposed to the national or business media.

Additional coverage on the topic of accessibility included:

The news that Delta Flight Products (DFP), in collaboration with AirForAll – a consortium of design and disability advocate organisations based in the UK – announced the launch of several new accessibility-focus products for the airline industry; including seating systems that allow users to remain in their own wheelchair for the entire journey, and an accessible toilet that accommodates an onboard wheelchair and up to two attendants.

United Airlines announced its collaboration with the United Spinal Association. The partnership was focused on improving the travel experience for customers with disabilities. The airline will be working together with United Spinal to explore future solutions and collaborate with its community of experts to harness their valuable feedback and help better meet the specific needs of customers who use wheelchairs.

In January 2025, Emirates announced it was set to be ‘the world’s first Autism Certified Airline’. Formally awarded by the International Board of Credentialing and Continuing Education Standards (IBCCES), in practice this means over 30,000 staff will be undergoing specialised autism and sensory awareness training. The airline will also be introducing ‘sensory guides’ and sensory products for neurodiverse passengers.

At the end of 2024, Alaska Airlines reported its improved practices for enhanced accessibility for travellers. The airline’s Disability Office teamed up with the Autism Society and port authorities to host a disability practice flight in Portland. The event gave guests with disabilities the chance to practice everything from navigating the airport, to going through security and even simulating a flight.

Reports of crews damaging passengers’ wheelchairs, and other similar issues, was another key theme in accessibility coverage. Again, it is worth noting that these stories were covered by UK national media, as opposed to trade titles. For instance:

20 February: Furious passenger blasts American Airlines and Delta after TWO wheelchairs were damaged and destroyed during separate trips in the same year.

01 May: ‘Degraded’ wheelchair user, 15, forced to shuffle up plane stairs and British Airways lost specialist chair.

29 September: Disabled traveller left ‘housebound’ for months after airline error.

04 December: Gatwick: Holiday ‘ruined’ after wheelchair broke on EasyJet plane.

Notably, Paralyzed Veterans of America’s response to a US Department of Transportation fine against American Airlines for its “unsafe and undignified treatment of passengers with disabilities who use mobility devices” accounted for 81% of the negative news coverage on this topic.

Other incidents also garnered significant coverage. In April, Southwest Airlines received substantial attention for poorly handling athletes’ wheelchairs on flights. The issue stemmed from a lack of communication, leading to the wheelchairs being disassembled despite the passengers’ requests, and then being presented to them in pieces at the end of the flight.

Notably, the coverage around wheelchairs specifically, as opposed to general accessibility articles, was far more negative than the average data set. For social media articles mentioning airlines and wheelchairs, the sentiment was as follows:

Negative coverage accounted for 49%

Neutral coverage accounted for 27%

Positive coverage accounted for 24%

Meanwhile, the majority of the corresponding news coverage mentioning wheelchairs was neutral, due to comments from spokespeople balancing out the overall sentiment of the articles. For example, in the case of Southwest Airlines, when the airline was accused of poorly handling athletes’ wheelchairs, the company’s statement effectively denied the charge.

While social media coverage of the incident may have been negative, the inclusion of the airline’s response in news articles contributed to a more neutral sentiment overall. This demonstrates how airline communication can influence the tone of media reports, even when the initial incident generates negative public reaction.

But what does all this media coverage really tell us? While in comparison to other topics, accessibility isn’t proving to have cut through the ‘noise’ of the media in the same way, it seems that the impact of a negative story – particularly when discussed on social media – can attract significant attention and potentially be hugely impactful to airline reputation.

When faced with negative accessibility coverage, airlines need to do more than just react. The data indicates that a crucial element of effective reputation management is proactively ensuring the inclusion of company spokespeople in media reports. This allows airlines to actively participate in shaping the narrative.

Therefore, airlines should adopt a proactive communication strategy that prioritises the inclusion of their spokespeople in accessibility-related reporting. By providing spokespeople to offer context, address concerns, and articulate the airline’s position, they can exert greater control over the narrative and mitigate the potential damage of negative coverage.

Maksim Jurkov, head of design at aviation innovator, J&C Aero, explains that when it comes to accessibility, regulations play an important role. He highlights the ‘FAA DOT requirements (14 CFR 382.65)’, which demand “Non-discrimination on the basis of disability in air travel” and that “the industry needs to transport persons with reduced mobility (PRM) while maintaining a reasonable level of accessibility during the flight phase.”

He adds, “The key industry players are actively working on accessibility for both linefit and retrofit programmes. Accessibility for persons with limitations on an aeroplane is a must, not an option, as it ensures safety, dignity, and equal opportunity for all travellers – for example, having accessible restrooms and boarding assistance allows everyone to travel independently and comfortably. Without it, people are unfairly excluded and face unnecessary risks or barriers.”

While regulations are essential, accessibility in aircraft interiors is more than just a requirement. It is a commitment to all passengers and to creating a truly inclusive flying experience for everyone on board.

Conclusion

This review of airline reputation sets out a roadmap for airlines, identifying the six key pillars on which an airline reputation is built. By focusing on each pillar of the reputation methodology, and the strategic adjustments that can be made within each area, airlines can significantly improve their overall reputation.

It is clear that there will be opportunities to gain a competitive advantage over competitors by focusing on sustainability initiatives – particularly by implementing those in the cabin, as reputation is largely driven by the Products and Services pillar.

By investing in innovative solutions that transform the cabin, airlines will be able to further strengthen their reputation, not only through products and service offerings, but through the creation of a collective vision which positions the airlines as leaders in responsible air travel.

Though accessibility is not an individual element within the six pillars of the ‘Reputation by Carma’ report, it does play an important role in the conduct pillar. Not to mention, as more and more accessible aircraft interior solutions enter the market, it’s becoming a growing priority for airlines.

There’s also an increasing amount of media coverage and social media discussion around the topic. By using the media to their advantage, airlines can improve their reputation through the spotlighting of accessible interiors solutions.

The data highlighted in this report illustrates an ecosystem of conversations around sustainability and accessibility in the traditional media and on social media. While neither topic may be dominating the media in the same way that some other aviation topics are, it is clear that the impact of these stories can be significant in affecting consumer views and perceptions.

Moving forward, airlines must recognise that sustainability and accessibility are about more than just compliance and instead are fundamental aspects of building trust and maintaining a positive reputation in an increasingly conscious and connected world.",https://s44875.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/airline-reputation-media.png.webp,N,,2025-04-24 09:56:29.319183

The new plan anticipates a nearly 90% reduction in the airline’s own emissions, with the majority of this decrease expected to come from the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), reports ESG today.

Wizz Air stated that this new roadmap aligns with the targets set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from international air travel by 2050.

However, in its announcement, Wizz Air pointed out that the aviation industry’s ambition heavily relies on the large-scale production of technology that is not yet fully developed. The airline emphasized that its own plan prioritizes SAF and advancements in aircraft technology over relying on unproven technologies and carbon offsetting schemes, unlike the plans of some other airlines.

Yvonne Moynihan, Wizz Air Corporate & ESG Officer, commented, “Wizz Air supports an ambitious vision for net zero, but the truth is that the current pace of change is not enough, and without radical intervention, aviation will fail to meet its commitments.”

Fuel consumption accounts for the vast majority of emissions in the aviation sector. SAF, typically produced from sustainable sources like waste oils and agricultural leftovers, is considered a crucial tool for reducing carbon emissions in the airline industry in the short to medium term. SAF producers estimate that these fuels can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 85% compared to traditional jet fuel.

However, efforts to significantly increase the use of SAF by airlines face considerable challenges, including the limited supply currently available and prices that are much higher than conventional fossil fuels. In 2024, SAF accounted for only about 0.5% of global commercial fuel use.

Wizz Air stated that SAF is the “cornerstone” of its net-zero plan, with the airline aiming for a 53% reduction in carbon emissions through increased SAF usage. The company stressed the need for governments to take action to boost SAF production through long-term policies and incentives to bridge the price gap between SAF and conventional jet fuel.

In addition to increasing SAF usage, Wizz Air’s plan outlines other key ways to reduce emissions. The company aims for a 21% reduction through technological improvements in aircraft and engine technology, 7% through renewing its fleet with newer, more efficient aircraft, 4% through reforms in air traffic management, and 2% through operational efficiencies.

Wizz Air’s own climate goals include reducing its carbon emissions intensity by 25% by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

Moynihan added, “We need action, not just ambition. That’s why we’re calling on governments, regulators, and the fuel industry to wake up to the reality of aviation’s transition and start delivering the changes that will make net zero possible. Aviation needs a policy and investment revolution to shape the industry’s path.”

Describing sustainability as a responsibility and not just a choice, EVA Air president, Clay Sun, said the bilateral collaborations with the fuel suppliers underpin the airline’s commitment to net-zero emissions. “By actively introducing SAF across our global network, we are reducing our operational carbon footprint and fostering transformation and growth throughout the aviation supply chain.”

CAA’s pilot to encourage SAF refuellings for domestic carriers

The three new agreements also follow EVA Air’s introduction of domestically produced SAF on 23 April as part of Taiwan’s Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) pilot programme for SAF usage. Although no SAF mandate is in place yet, the CAA is encouraging airlines to use up to 5% SAF from 2030. The pilot saw three domestic carriers across the country refuel with a SAF blend. State-owned CPC Corporation imported 400 metric tonnes of SAF, and Formosa Petrochemical produced 5,500 tonnes of the renewable fuels so far this year for the operation. The SAF was supplied to Kaohsiung, Songshan and Taoyuan airports, with China Airlines and Starlux also refuelling with the SAF blend.

The fuel uplifted by EVA Air was blended into two international flights: BR156 from Taipei Songshan Airport to Seoul Gimpo International Airport and BR148 from Kaohsiung International Airport to Kansai International Airport in Japan. A statement from the airline said it will continue to expand its use of SAF and actively engage in global sustainability initiatives.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EVA-Air-SAF-refuelling.jpg,N,,2025-04-24 09:56:38.402921

JetZero's Z4 blended wing body or ""all wing"" design has the potential to enhance passenger experience and improve fuel efficiency by up to 50%2

JetZero was awarded a $235 million contract by the U.S. Air Force to fast-track the development of its commercial demonstrator with first flight expected in 2027

CHICAGO, April 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- United today announced an investment in blended wing body (BWB) aircraft start-up JetZero. The company is creating an aircraft design that has the potential to deliver jet fuel efficiency and a greatly enhanced customer experience. The investment includes a path to order up to 100 airplanes and an option for an additional 100. The conditional purchase agreement is based on JetZero achieving development milestones, including flight of a full-scale demonstrator in 2027, among other conditions, including that the aircraft meet United's safety, business and operating requirements.

JetZero's innovative design reduces drag and produces lift across the entire wingspan, which could lead to as much as 50% reduction in fuel burn per passenger mile compared to a similar sized aircraft. The technology could potentially help United lower its carbon emissions while reducing the cost of operations. In 2023, the U.S. Air Force announced a $235 million contract to JetZero to fast-track the development of JetZero's full scale demonstrator. The JetZero Z4 airplane is designed to accommodate 250 passengers and fly on conventional jet fuel, with propulsion systems able to utilize sustainable aviation fuel blends.

""If successful, JetZero has the potential to evolve our core mainline business by developing aircraft with a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers while increasing fuel efficiency across our network,"" said Andrew Chang, head of United Airlines Ventures (UAV). ""United Airlines Ventures® was created to support our efforts to find innovative companies that can enhance the customer travel experience and help the airline lower its carbon footprint, and we believe JetZero reflects that philosophy.""

""United's investment in our company signals the industry's belief that new, innovative technology is needed in order to achieve the efficiency and cost savings that will be required to meet the continued growth in demand for air travel across the globe,"" said Tom O'Leary, CEO and co-founder of JetZero. ""JetZero is focused on one key technology – the airframe – that enables us to address all of the barriers to growth. This program is the only one in development today that promises efficiency and an elevated customer experience.""

Both the airplane's shape, and the way JetZero plans to enter the plane into service, address industry pain points. The design contributes to a more efficient operation due to its shape and the higher altitude at which it will fly. For instance, a flight from New York/Newark to Palma de Mallorca, Spain would use up to 45 percent less fuel compared to the twin-aisle aircraft that operate that route today. The airplane also is expected to integrate readily into today's airport infrastructure, requiring no new accommodations for jet bridges, runways or taxiways.

The aircraft design has the potential to also offer improvements to the passenger experience like flexible seating options, larger seats across all classes and dedicated overhead bin space for each seat. Additionally, the design streamlines the boarding process with a main boarding door that is wider than that of a comparably sized aircraft, leading to multiple aisles and passenger cabin bays for more efficient passenger distribution. It may further enhance accessibility by featuring wider aisles and handicap-accessible lavatories, creating a comfortable travel environment for all passengers and in-flight crew.

JetZero's agreement with the Air Force focuses on advancing airframe technology and capabilities, showcasing its potential, and providing the Department of Defense and commercial industry more options to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. Several military aircraft configurations can be made with this design, including air transport and refueling tanker variants, which collectively account for approximately 60% of the Air Force's total annual jet fuel consumption.

United's corporate venture capital fund, United Airlines Ventures, enables the airline to invest in emerging companies that have the potential to influence the future of travel. UAV has made investments in start-ups developing innovative technologies that have the potential to revolutionize aerospace developments, create value for customers and United's operation and complement United's goal of net zero emissions by 2050. UAV has made a number of alternative aircraft investments including:

Hybrid-electric

It enables flow of trade, investment, labour and tourism, which will contribute to our prosperity.","Having acquired AGS Airports, which operates Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton Airports in January, AviAlliance has confirmed a £350 million investment in the sustainable growth of the three UK airports.

AviAlliance, a wholly owned subsidiary of one of Canada’s largest pension investors – PSP Investments, completed the £1.53 billion acquisition of the airport group earlier this year and on Wednesday outlined plans of what will be the single largest capital investment programme in AGS since it was formed in 2014.

Airport transformation

Plans to accelerate the decarbonisation and future growth of the three regional airports include a comprehensive transformation of Glasgow Airport’s main terminal building to accommodate anticipated passenger growth and improve operational and retail facilities, as well as upgrades to airfield infrastructure and energy efficiency initiatives.

Meanwhile, Southampton Airport, which underwent a 164-m runway extension in 2023 will now also undergo redevelopment works within its terminal. Aberdeen Airport, which is also home to Europe’s largest heliport primarily for the offshore industry transporting passengers and cargo between the Scottish hub and oil rigs in the North Sea, will also benefit from improvements to its airfield infrastructure.

Boos for trade and tourism

Underlining the critical role that AGS plays in driving economic and social prosperity across Scotland and the UK, Kam Jandu AGS Airports CEO explained the investment will help facilitate the accelerated growth of AGS which supports more than 30,000 jobs and generates in excess of £2 billion in Gross Value Added (GVA) for the UK economy every year. Jandu, who was formerly CEO of Budapest Airport where he worked for 15 years, was named CEO of the airport group when AviAlliance completed its acquisition in January.

“We have ambitious plans for the long-term sustainable growth of our airports including the strengthening of our connectivity, which underpins the success of the regions we serve,” he said. “This significant investment will not only enhance the fabric of our airports, it will enhance the role they currently play in facilitating trade and tourism, and importantly in generating meaningful employment across the country.”

Jandu also welcomed Charles Hammond OBE as the new Chair of AGS. A qualified lawyer, Hammond was previously Chief Executive of Forth Ports, in which AviAlliance is also a majority stakeholder. Hammond revealed he is “relishing the opportunity of working with the AGS board, to ensure AGS can play an even greater role in supporting our regions to boost trade and tourism.”

Sustainable growth

Deputy First Minister of Scotland, Kate Forbes (pictured with Kam Jandu) reinforced that the investment will bring huge benefits to the wider economy through improved infrastructure. “Good international connectivity is key to economic growth in Scotland. It enables flow of trade, investment, labour and tourism, which will contribute to our prosperity. Additionally, the commitment to sustainability is welcome as we progress towards a net zero future.”

All three airports achieved carbon neutrality status on the Airport Carbon Accreditation initiative for the emissions under their direct control (Scopes 1 and 2) in 2020. The aim is to achieve net zero carbon for indirect emission by the mid-2030s through the decarbonisation of cars and public transport, the deployment of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and aircraft fuel efficiency programmes, as well as the decarbonisation of third part owned and operated operational vehicles and the deployment of fixed electric ground power and electric tugs to replace aircraft taxiing. The group’s sustainability strategy is based on three pillars: achieving net zero by the mid-2030s; supporting and enhancing the economic and social benefits of the communities each airport serves; and supporting its staff through providing good employment conditions, respecting diversity and equal opportunities for all staff.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kam-Jandu-and-Kate-Forbes-at-Glasgow-Airport-.jpg,N,,2025-04-24 07:56:44.204441
