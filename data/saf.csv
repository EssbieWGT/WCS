The announcement came as its latest aircraft, B-50028, arrived from Airbus’s Toulouse facility with a 5% SAF blend, cutting emissions by around 80% compared to conventional fuel, per UDN. Nine A320neo jets will be delivered under this plan, per CNA.

Tigerair Taiwan expects to receive two new A320neo aircraft this year following earlier delivery delays. Each will be ferried using a fixed SAF percentage as part of the airline’s carbon-reduction strategy. Ferry flights refer to one-way trips for delivery or maintenance purposes.

The A320neo fleet is a core part of Tigerair Taiwan’s modernization program, the carrier said. These jets offer up to 18% better fuel efficiency and 50% less noise, thanks to new engines and sharklet winglets.

The airline also touted improved passenger comfort, noting that the aircraft features the widest single-aisle cabin in the market. This supports its broader effort to combine sustainability with service quality.

In a joint letter with Cllr Anne Handley, leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, addressed to secretary of state for business and trade, Jonathan Reynolds MP, as well as Heidi Alexander MP, secretary of state for transport, Cllr Ross stressed the need for strong central government support for Vivergo Fuels ahead of next week’s launch of the national Industrial Strategy.

He stated that the future of the Vivergo plant, based at Saltend Chemicals Park, is at imminent risk as a result of the recent UK-US trade deal and poor regulation.

Cllr Ross outlined the wider impact closure of Vivergo Fuels could have on the region and how it also raises questions about the government’s commitment to green energy and its policies to support it.

In the letter, Cllr Ross said: “Not only is Vivergo Fuels the UK’s largest bioethanol producer, with a crucial role to play in UK transport decarbonisation, but it’s also a strategically important anchor employer in the region.

“It supports over 160 skilled jobs directly and around 4,000 more in the supply chain, the majority of which are based in our Hull and East Riding region.

“The Humber has gained a deserved reputation as a beacon for renewable energy development and production and we are working extremely hard to attract further investment to the region in emerging technologies. such as hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel.

“This would be immeasurably harder to do if regulatory and financial support are not forthcoming for this business, which has already seen over £700m of private sector investment since 2012.

“The Government’s new UK-USA trade deal has deliberately moved the commercial goalposts, damaging a UK business, which invests in the UK and employs UK workers, whilst advantaging American businesses who produce their product overseas.

“Allowing closure of the Vivergo Fuels plant would send a hugely damaging signal to clean energy investors and to any businesses who are considering investing in this region and across the UK.

“The government has identified clean energy as one of its priority industries and states that its number one focus is encouraging growth, so we now need to see that rhetoric matched with concrete actions and support.

Palantir is cutting emissions by 31% from its 2019 baseline. It offsets the rest with high-quality carbon credits.

This achievement shows how software companies can lead in ESG even without making physical products. Its “product-first” strategy helps customers create climate solutions. At the same time, it keeps its own footprint low. This is ideal for investors who care about AI and sustainability. Let’s uncover how Palantir achieves its net-zero goal.

Cutting Code and Carbon: How Palantir Hits Net Zero

Palantir reached a major sustainability milestone in 2024 by achieving carbon neutrality across its global operations. This was made possible by reducing its total greenhouse gas emissions by 31% compared to its 2019 baseline.

In 2024, Palantir reported emissions of 23,018 metric tons of CO₂ equivalent (tCO₂e), a slight increase of 1.7% from 2023, when emissions were at 22,635 tCO₂e.

The company attributes the 2024 increase to a gradual return to business travel and operational activity. The trend shows clear progress. Emissions per employee have fallen by 57% since 2019. Now, each employee is responsible for only 6 tCO₂e.

Palantir’s carbon footprint is small compared to companies with physical supply chains or manufacturing. As a software company, it neither owns nor operates production facilities and primarily leases office spaces.

The software giant’s direct (Scope 1 and 2) emissions remain low and are mostly tied to heating and electricity use in its offices. The company partners with utility providers and landlords. This helps them gather better data on energy use, which improves reporting accuracy.

Most of Palantir’s emissions are Scope 3. This includes business travel, employee commuting, cloud computing, and third-party services. Business travel, in particular, has been the largest contributor.

To lessen this impact, Palantir urges employees to hold virtual meetings. They can join programs like United Airlines’ Eco-Skies Alliance. This program helps create sustainable aviation fuel.

Palantir has made notable progress in reducing emissions from its digital infrastructure. Between 2022 and 2023, the company’s cloud computing emissions fell by 32%. This decline was largely due to more energy-efficient data centers and software optimization.

The company is looking for partnerships with cloud providers. They focus on renewable energy and high energy-efficiency ratings.

RELATED: Palantir Reports Record-Breaking Q4 and Net Zero Success

To balance its residual emissions, Palantir purchases and retires verified carbon credits that support projects such as:

Landfill gas capture

Destruction of ozone-depleting substances

Renewable energy development

These projects were chosen for their environmental credibility. They also match the company’s commitment to long-term sustainability.

In 2023, Palantir formalized its environmental efforts by publishing its first Environmental Policy. The same year, its UK operations released a Carbon Reduction Plan, committing to a 42% cut in emissions by 2029. These steps show a bigger plan to include climate goals in how we operate and share information with the public.

Building Green Tools: Palantir’s Climate-Focused AI Platforms

Palantir not only manages its own environmental impact but also helps other organizations reach their climate and net zero goals. It uses its strong AI and data platforms to do this. The company describes itself as having a “product-first” philosophy—one that gives customers the tools to build climate solutions at scale.

Palantir offers platforms like Foundry, Gotham, and the Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). These support many climate-related use cases. These include:

Building digital twins of infrastructure to simulate environmental risks

Enhancing grid resilience through predictive modeling

Planning electric vehicle infrastructure deployment

Tracking carbon emissions across supply chains and operations

One of Palantir’s flagship ESG tools is the Agora platform, launched in 2022. Agora enables energy and commodity firms to monitor supply chain emissions in real time.

At the 2023 Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC), Palantir showed how Agora helps big partners like bp, Ecopetrol, and Trafigura. They use it to track, analyze, and cut carbon emissions from oil and gas operations.

In July 2024, Palantir teamed up with Tree Energy Solutions (TES). This partnership aims to boost green hydrogen production. TES uses Palantir’s software to model its supply chain, which includes hydrogen production sites and transport logistics. This helps track emissions, optimize energy use, and scale low-carbon fuel projects more quickly.

Palantir also works on internal sustainability initiatives. For example, in its London office, the company partners with Fooditude to reduce plastic and food waste. This partnership has cut single-use water bottles by 80%. It also promotes eco-friendly packaging and food sourcing.

Palantir is growing its AI and data operations. The company is also working hard to make its software and infrastructure more energy efficient. This means creating lighter apps, reducing server strain by optimizing workloads, and choosing cloud providers that use renewable energy.

Palantir’s approach highlights how software companies can impact climate change. They do this not only by reducing their own emissions but also by offering digital tools. These tools help speed up decarbonization in various industries.

Low Footprint, High Ambition

Palantir’s low footprint reflects its business model. It leases offices rather than owning buildings and doesn’t operate factories or own data centers. Even its cloud usage—from AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud—is relatively clean, with a 32% year‑over‑year drop in cloud‑related emissions from 2022 to 2023.

The company uses market-based accounting for Scope 2 and regularly audits its energy sources to improve accuracy. It invests in compute‑efficiency improvements for its AI platforms as well.

Palantir continues to reduce emissions in every area and offset what remains through verified credits and sustainable aviation fuel. It also submitted its emissions targets to the Science‑Based Targets Initiative in 2023 to gain external validation.

Why ESG‑Minded Investors Are Paying Attention

For investors focused on AI and ESG—especially those preferring companies with strong sustainability records—Palantir offers a compelling case with these reasons:

It proves corporate carbon neutrality is doable even for tech firms with global operations.

It features transparent emissions reporting, including per‑employee metrics and absolute reductions.

It enables other companies to reduce their own carbon footprints through Palantir-powered analytics.

Palantir shows that software companies can aim for net zero without sacrificing innovation. After reducing emissions by up to 38% since 2019 and offsetting the rest, it remains carbon neutral through 2024. Meanwhile, its AI platforms serve as foundations for climate solutions—from decarbonizing industry to planning clean energy.

For ESG-conscious investors and industry professionals, Palantir offers proof that advanced AI can support a sustainable future—not just improve the bottom line. Its path shows how tech giants can help the planet while building value, one code line at a time.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/shutterstock_2566125289.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 18:03:46.763833

The goal is to reach 3 per cent to 5 per cent SAF use by 2030.
“We are aware of concerns raised by various stakeholders, including the EU and the US, regarding fraudulent practices in the SAF supply chain.
Mr Robert Boyd, Boeing’s Asia-Pacific sustainability lead who previously worked for Iata, believes airlines’ exacting standards will bring positive change in the SAF industry.","– This is the starting point for the world’s – and especially Europe’s – lofty dreams of greener air travel: a collection point for plastic bottles filled with discarded frying oil in Malaysia.

One Saturday morning in May 2025 in the city of Melaka, volunteers in green T-shirts rushed over as Ms Adibah Rahim and her husband drove into the central square, eager to unpack, weigh and register her consignment of used cooking oil (UCO) – the “liquid gold” in European and Asian plans to ramp up production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Ms Rahim, a housewife, told The Straits Times it was her first time selling used oil, which she had collected over five to six months. She left the collection point RM90 (S$27) richer: At RM3 per litre of oil, it is a welcome boost to her family’s household budget.

“We usually collect UCO from around 200 members of the public,” said Mr Michael Andrew, sales manager for Evergreen Oil & Feed, the company running the Melaka collection with the local council. Evergreen, which runs similar collection drives elsewhere in Malaysia, supplies leading European SAF producers such as Spain’s Repsol, UK-based Shell and Finland’s Neste, the operator of SAF refineries in Europe and Singapore.

The aviation industry and many governments, including Singapore’s, are pinning their hopes on SAF as a way to cut the sector’s greenhouse gas emissions, which are set to increase as demand for flying grows.

And fuel suppliers around the world are scrambling for raw materials to meet new legal SAF blending quotas in Europe and growing demand elsewhere.

When it is made from waste such as UCO, rather than agricultural commodities such as soya or palm oil, SAF purportedly has up to 80 per cent less planet-heating emissions than kerosene jet fuel. And repurposing waste cooking oil avoids using land that would otherwise be used for food crops, or fuelling forest destruction.

But behind SAF’s climate-friendly facade, a months-long investigation by Climate Home News and The Straits Times has uncovered an opaque global supply chain that exposes jet fuel providers and their aviation clients to significant fraud risks – raising doubts about the climate benefits of the sector’s main green hope for the years ahead.

The concern is that barely used and virgin palm oil – the latter is not permitted under European Union rules because of its links to rainforest loss – is being passed off as UCO that traders supply to fuel companies, experts and industry operators said.

The investigation focused on the UCO trade between Malaysia, the world’s second-biggest palm oil producer, and Spain, the EU’s largest aviation market and home to one of its SAF pioneers – oil and gas giant Repsol.

The investigation was funded by Journalismfund Europe.

Fried in Spain?

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, Repsol chief executive Josu Jon Imaz held up his company’s new €250 million (S$369 million) plant for renewable fuels, including SAF, near the historic Spanish port town of Cartagena as an example of how Europe can pursue a fair green transition.

Repsol, which aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, started large-scale production of biodiesel and jet fuel – with its SAF mainly made from UCO – at the plant early in 2024.

Contrasting this with electric vehicles, many of them imported from China, Dr Imaz said the raw material for Repsol’s renewable fuels “comes from the Spanish farms and from the Spanish rural economy”.

In a promotional video for those fuels, Spanish celebrity chef Susi Diaz is seen dispensing advice to young cooks in the kitchen of her La Finca restaurant. Olive oil is then poured out of a pan into steel jugs as a voiceover explains how the waste cooking residue will be sent to the Repsol biofuel refinery.

The company is also promoting the recycling of UCO from Spanish households – of which it says only 5 per cent is currently collected – at its fuel stations across the country.

Spain’s restaurants and homes, however, are not the main source of Repsol’s UCO.

In 2024, more than 126,000 tonnes of UCO from Asia – enough to fill 50 Olympic-size swimming pools – arrived in the Spanish region of Murcia, where Repsol’s flagship biofuel plant is located, according to trade data published by Spain’s tax agency.

Nearly two-thirds came from Malaysia, whose UCO exports to the region saw a tenfold rise in the same year that the energy heavyweight fired up its Cartagena SAF refinery.

The figures do not specify who provided or bought the raw material. But trade data shows that Repsol purchased at least 53,000 tonnes of UCO from five Malaysian companies, including Evergreen Oil & Feed, in 2024. That amount represents 18 per cent of the UCO the Repsol plant in Cartagena uses annually.

This is based on an analysis of Customs records provided by investigative consultancy Data Desk, which provided Climate Home News with a list of shipments of UCO certified for the European market, sourced from Malaysia by Repsol’s trading unit in Singapore.

No incidents of fraudulent UCO were detected in Repsol’s supply chain, with imports meeting EU rules on green certification.

Repsol told Climate Home News it “complements with imports when necessary” and receives raw material shipments from more than 20 countries. It declined to provide more details about the imports for “competitive reasons”.

Repsol’s heavy reliance on Malaysian supplies exposes it to fraud risks that raise wider questions about global assertions over the sustainability of SAF.

Asked what steps it takes to fight fraud, Repsol said it operates a rigorous supplier monitoring system to ensure the sustainability and integrity of its SAF production. A “very strong” compliance process means dubious raw materials and suppliers suspected of misconduct are quickly weeded out, it added.

“Any type of fraud distorts the market and undermines the confidence in the system, so it must be fought with all possible legal means,” the company said in e-mailed comments.

Shrinking air travel’s carbon footprint

Europe’s green aviation fuel refineries are boosting output because of new requirements by the EU for planes to use more SAF in the coming decades. From the start of 2025, fuel supplied to airports across Europe needs to contain at least 2 per cent of SAF, with targets rising to 70 per cent by 2050.

A million tonnes of SAF is needed to hit the EU’s 2025 mandate, and this will rise to 2.7 million tonnes a year by 2030 to meet the 6 per cent mandate.

SAF is crucial for shrinking aviation’s carbon footprint, according to industry body the International Air Transport Association (Iata), and is expected to account for 65 per cent of emissions reductions by 2050, when the sector has committed to reaching net zero.

In 2023, emissions from international plane travel accounted for 2.5 per cent of the world’s energy-related carbon emissions. As air travel increases, and other sectors are more easily able to decarbonise, that share is set to grow.

One of the reasons SAF is so attractive is that it is a drop-in fuel for planes, requiring no new additional infrastructure at airports. Current technology allows up to 50 per cent of SAF to be blended with fossil fuel-based jet fuel.

Repsol’s Dr Imaz told financial analysts early in 2024 that emissions-cutting alternatives to SAF – such as restricting short-haul flights – would represent “a drop in the ocean”.

Repsol’s plant uses 300,000 tonnes of UCO to produce 250,000 tonnes of renewable fuels, including SAF and hydrotreated vegetable oil.

But surging demand for UCO, SAF’s feedstock of choice, and a far-from-perfect global certification system based on self-declaration at the start of the supply chain are encouraging fraud that undermines the new fuel’s green credentials.

‘Ridiculous’ export statistics

This investigation found that by the time Asia-based traders ship UCO supplies overseas to refineries for processing into SAF, guaranteeing their environmental integrity is virtually impossible – despite the certification system on which fuel companies and airlines rely.

A source at a leading Malaysian UCO supplier to companies including Repsol told ST that he suspects that both UCO collectors and restaurants are committing fraud by providing oil that does not qualify as used, although it is difficult to prove.

In Malaysia, which is among the world’s leading suppliers of UCO and virgin palm oil, government-subsidised cooking oil is cheaper than UCO – providing a clear incentive for fraud. Subsidised cooking oil sells for RM2.50 per kg versus the UCO trading price of up to RM4.50 per kg.

In a 2024 report, Brussels-based environmental group Transport & Environment (T&E) cited figures showing that Malaysia already exports about three times as much UCO as it is estimated to collect domestically and import, raising concern about where that oil is coming from – and what it consists of.

In 2023, 458,000 tonnes of UCO originating in Malaysia were registered with International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), the leading certification scheme recognised by the European Commission to demonstrate compliance with its biofuel sustainability criteria.

In absolute terms, that puts Malaysia second only to China, which registered 1.65 million tonnes. Malaysia’s UCO volume, if indeed collected from its population, works out to 15.2 litres per person – the highest worldwide by far.

This figure is “ridiculous”, said Mr Cian Delaney, campaign coordinator at T&E, adding that for it to be feasible, Malaysia would need to be “a world-leading collection and refining system – which it isn’t”.

In comparison, China collected 1.4 litres per capita, while the figure is 0.9 litre in Indonesia and 3.8 litres in Spain.

Malaysia’s Deputy Minister of Plantation and Commodities Chan Foong Hin has previously acknowledged there is fraud in the country’s UCO supply chain. He told Reuters in February 2025 that the government would crack down on this to uphold the country’s “reputation as a responsible exporter”.

In a response to questions from ST, he said: “To maintain supply chain integrity, various measures are in place, including traceability systems, certification requirements, and stringent export documentation. The Malaysian Palm Oil Board , in collaboration with other regulatory bodies, is actively monitoring the industry to prevent fraudulent activities.”

He also said the government was strengthening enforcement mechanisms to uphold industry credibility.

Opaque supply chain

The waste ingredients from which SAF is made change hands multiple times in a largely opaque system. To verify their sustainability, European regulators rely on checks by private auditors and agencies that issue green certificates based on their findings.

But there is a systemic blind spot: The restaurants, street stalls, households and factories from which the UCO is pooled self-declare the origin of their contributions. Aside from ad hoc spot checks and sampling, there is no way of knowing that all of these providers are telling the truth.

“The opportunity ... of fraud is very high,” said Mr Vasu R. Vasuthewan, former Malaysia head for the ISCC.

The Malaysian authorities recently uncovered criminal syndicates that had pocketed thousands of dollars a day by getting hold of large amounts of subsidised cooking oil, mixing it in with UCO, and then selling it on to industrial UCO traders.

Sources within the industry told Climate Home News and ST that many households and restaurants are motivated to replace cooking oil after a single use – contrary to the standard practice of three to five times – and then sell it on as UCO. Cooking oil is considered waste when it is no longer fit for frying.

“Restaurant compliance (with sustainability standards) may be very low,” said Mr Vasuthewan, who now runs his own UCO import and export business. “Many will fake their declaration, hoping they won’t get caught.”

Mr Delaney of T&E said it is difficult for auditors to physically check the origin of the oil, since hundreds of restaurants can supply the same collection point, making it a “notable blind spot”.

Singapore, a global SAF hub in the making

Singapore is a key part of the global SAF supply chain and is positioning itself as a leader in the production and usage of such fuel. The Republic is home to the world’s largest SAF refinery by capacity: Neste’s biofuel refinery in Tuas. Its SAF production capacity is one million tonnes a year.

Government trade data shows that Singapore is a major importer of UCO from China and Malaysia; this is most likely for the Neste refinery. The Republic also has a licensing framework for local UCO collectors, who pick up UCO mainly from restaurants, hotels and commercial kitchens, with about 19,000 tonnes collected annually from 2021 to 2024, according to the National Environment Agency.

The Government regards SAF as a critical tool to reduce aviation emissions while allowing the industry to keep expanding and Changi Airport, one of the world’s busiest, to keep growing.

To ramp up SAF usage, from 2026, all flights departing Singapore’s two civilian airports must use 1 per cent SAF. The goal is to reach 3 per cent to 5 per cent SAF use by 2030.

Fraud is a concern for the authorities and the industry.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) told ST that it recognises the importance of ensuring transparency and integrity in SAF feedstocks.

“We are aware of concerns raised by various stakeholders, including the EU and the US, regarding fraudulent practices in the SAF supply chain. We share the same concerns as these pose risks to market confidence, fair trading and development of a nascent SAF market,” said CAAS chief sustainability officer Daniel Ng.

He said the authority is working with the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection to develop “harmonised standards for feedstock verification to prevent further fraudulent practices”.

Neste told ST, in response to questions: “Neste sources traceable UCO and other renewable raw materials globally from carefully selected suppliers. Neste evaluates its suppliers and accepts renewable raw materials only from those suppliers that are able to meet strict criteria for sustainability.”

The Singapore Airlines Group said it works closely with its partners to ensure supplies meet internationally recognised standards such as the ISCC, and comply with regulatory requirements in jurisdictions with SAF mandates.

Spot checks, patchy audits

There is a system in place to keep fraudulent stocks out of the supply chain. Buyers and regulators in Europe rely on audit companies to trace the raw materials used in SAF and prove their green credentials.

Those audits are verified by authorised certification systems like the ISCC – which is led by the biofuel industry and, according to one source, enjoys “a kind of monopoly” in the sector. It then issues sustainability certificates to commodities traders and fuel suppliers.

According to the ISCC, its certification supports “sustainable, fully traceable, deforestation-free and climate-friendly supply chains”.

While in some cases auditors conduct random field checks, that happens less often in countries outside the EU, industry experts say.

According to Mr James Cogan, compliance and markets lead at Irish biofuel firm ClonBio, it is far easier for fraud to occur outside the EU where “it’s much less visible to us”.

A 2024 analysis by T&E in China, for example, showed that sampling of points of origin happened in less than 10 per cent of the ISCC-approved audits, whereas in the EU, it was about 30 per cent.

Mr Adam Kirby, ISCC’s senior sustainability manager, told Climate Home News that auditors monitor volumes going in and out of collection points for any suspicious behaviour, in addition to carrying out spot checks. He added that the ISCC follows the requirements established by regulators like the European Commission.

In 2024, the ISCC also conducted 79 special “integrity assessments” – around two-thirds targeting Asia-based suppliers – which independently monitored the work of auditors. In a third of the cases, it found violations of its certification requirements, including an inability to demonstrate the traceability of products, leading to the withdrawal of 11 certificates.

Long paper trail

Under the current system, the entire SAF supply chain relies on a long paper trail rooted in those self-declarations and sporadic inspections at the points where UCO is collected.

In Malaysia, Evergreen’s owner C.K. Lau told ST that the company follows the proper processes in its collection based on the requirements established by the ISCC. He added that the documentation is critical as, otherwise, the company would not be able to export its UCO.

Repsol, for its part, said it requires “suppliers to be certified under European Commission-recognised voluntary regimes”.

In turn, airline companies that buy from Repsol, such as the International Airlines Group (IAG) – the parent company of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling, Aer Lingus and Level – rely on documentation they get from it and other jet fuel providers, to show that the SAF they are paying for has green certification.

In exceptional cases, IAG has sent its own staff to carry out checks on the ground, as with a Shanghai-based Chinese supplier in 2024. It told Climate Home News the outcome of that audit – which included supply, record-keeping, environmental and health and safety standards – was “positive”.

Mr Robert Boyd, Boeing’s Asia-Pacific sustainability lead who previously worked for Iata, believes airlines’ exacting standards will bring positive change in the SAF industry. “You’ll see a race to the top... on sustainability, and it will, in a way, be self-regulated,” he added.

SAF certification faces EU scrutiny

In the meantime, following a string of fraud allegations about the authenticity of UCO-derived biofuels imported from China, the EU has been trying to ascertain whether the certification system that governments and businesses rely on is fit for purpose.

The EU authorities have been in talks to strengthen that system, leading to speculation that the ISCC could be suspended for failing to catch cases of biodiesel fraud. The ISCC denied in a statement that regulators had considered halting automatic EU-wide acceptance of its certificates, adding that its relationship with the European Commission remained constructive.

“There are always bad actors, there are always bad people, and there’s only a certain amount of policing that can be done in any industry,” said Mr Kirby. “We at ISCC have done, I think, an incredible job.”

The ISCC did not respond to follow-up questions from Climate Home News on whether it has full confidence in the current system, including self-declaration.

A European Commission spokeswoman said the bloc’s executive arm was closely monitoring the SAF market “to detect and prevent fraud, which risks undermining the EU’s ambition to effectively decarbonise air transport”.

Demand for UCO sizzles

Demand for SAF and UCO is only expected to increase as usage in Europe, Asia and elsewhere grows and as new refineries are completed in China, South Korea and Malaysia.

In 2024, Malaysia’s state energy firm Petronas, Italy’s Enilive, and Euglena of Japan announced they would develop a biorefinery at Petronas’ Pengerang Integrated Complex in Johor. Due for completion in 2028, it would produce SAF and other biofuels.

Malaysia plans to mandate SAF usage by 2027, with the initial goal of blending it into aviation fuel at a 1 per cent rate.

Leading European refiners like Repsol are pushing for a level global playing field as well as more public funding to bring down costs and help develop the nascent sector on the continent.

Iata warned earlier in June that the European mandates had caused the SAF price paid by airlines to double because of hefty compliance fees being charged by producers.

Repsol’s aviation head Carlos Suarez Cubillo warned that fuel producers in parts of the world with laxer rules could produce SAF “with less regulation and less control of the feedstock... and here in Europe that could de-incentivise the production, the construction of new facilities”.

In Brazil, for example, an emerging SAF industry is gearing up to use crop-based feedstocks that are commonly linked to deforestation – and are therefore banned in Europe – such as soya and palm oil, as well as sugarcane-based ethanol, which has been linked to labour abuses and modern slavery.

An investigation by Climate Home News’ partner in Brazil, InfoAmazonia, found that the palm oil producer behind a planned biorefinery in the Amazon region – billed as Brazil’s first SAF project – is growing the crop on land areas subject to sanctions by the national environment agency over illegal deforestation, and is struggling financially after rights abuse allegations.

Iata hopes its efforts to put in place a global registry for SAF, launched in April as a voluntary initiative, will boost transparency around feedstocks and their greenhouse gas savings – and enable airlines to have some level of visibility and comparability between countries, fuel providers and airports.

SAF producers and airlines are also looking to other waste-based materials to meet rising mandates – especially as more advanced fuels made from hydrogen and carbon dioxide, known as e-SAF, are still being developed and tested.

Repsol, for example, recently closed a deal with US vegetable oils giant Bunge to source camelina and safflower – non-food crops that can grow on poor land – to produce hydrotreated vegetable oil for biodiesel and SAF.

In January, it also announced it would invest more than €800 million in Europe’s first plant in the Catalan city of Tarragona to produce renewable methanol from organic urban waste, for use in maritime, road and aviation transport from 2029.

But in the meantime, Europe’s overwhelming reliance on UCO means it will continue to import supplies from Asia – despite the concerns over fraud, said Ms Sophie Byron, global head of biofuels pricing at S&P Global Commodity Insights.

“That trade flow is not going away any time soon,” she said.

While that is a relatively small share of total global emissions, it looks set to increase in the decades to come, as significantly cutting emissions is still a distant technological prospect for commercial aircraft, even as other sectors, such as road transport, are doing so by going electric.

For airlines and governments across the world, the solution is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which backers say can cut emissions by more than 80 per cent, without requiring aircraft modifications.

SAF is designed to be a drop-in fuel for planes, needing no new additional infrastructure at airports. Current technology allows up to 50 per cent of SAF to be blended with fossil fuel-based jet fuel.

Here are some key things to know about SAF:

How is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made?

The fuel can be made from a variety of raw materials, or feedstocks, using different techniques, but today virtually all of it is made from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (Hefa). The Hefa production process involves stripping oxygen from the fat molecules of natural oils and fats and replacing it with hydrogen. Hefa fuel has various uses, including in aviation.

Used cooking oil (UCO) is currently the most common feedstock for SAF, especially in Europe where policies promote its use as a recycled waste product that does not compete for land with food production or carry a high risk of deforestation, in contrast to virgin oils derived from soya beans or palm.

Other regions are prioritising feedstocks that can be easily sourced locally, such as soya in the US and palm oil in Brazil. The two agricultural powerhouses are also expected to produce large quantities of SAF by converting ethanol made from corn or sugarcane – another kind of drop-in fuel known as alcohol-to-jet.

SAF can also be made without crops or organic waste. Synthetic fuels – known as e-SAF or power-to-liquid SAF – are made using hydrogen, generated from renewable electricity, and carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere or industrial processes.

How much SAF are airlines using?

A tiny amount. SAF accounted for just 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production in 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association, which has called the take-up rate “disappointing”.

Cost is the main reason for the slow roll-out. Currently, SAF is between two and seven times more expensive than traditional jet fuel, depending on how it is produced. That is primarily down to the limited availability of feedstocks like UCO, which is hard to collect from restaurants and households. The price of fossil fuel-based jet fuel is also kept artificially low because of wide-ranging tax exemptions.

Around the world, a number of governments are trying to expand the market for cleaner aviation fuels by offering financial incentives and making the use of SAF in planes compulsory.

The European Union and the UK introduced the world’s first SAF mandates in January 2025, requiring fuel suppliers to blend at least 2 per cent SAF with conventional kerosene. The blending requirement will gradually increase to reach 32 per cent in the EU and 22 per cent in the UK by 2040.

SAF mandates are also coming into force over the next few years in Singapore and Brazil, and other major aviation hubs such as Japan and China plan to introduce targets for its use.

Singapore has been very active in trying to grow regional demand for such fuel. In May , the World Economic Forum and Singapore’s GenZero, a Temasek-owned investment platform, launched the Green Fuel Forward initiative to scale up production of SAF. The initiative draws in airlines, refiners, logistics companies, banks and others to invest in greater SAF usage.

Will SAF lead to net-zero air travel?

That remains to be seen. Existing and planned SAF projects in advanced stages will meet between 2 per cent and 4 per cent of jet fuel demand by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency, far short of what is needed to put the sector on track to meet its goal of reaching net zero by 2050.

Airlines have been sounding the alarm about scant supplies and demanding policies to incentivise production to lower costs. In March, the chief executive officers of Ryanair, the International Airline Group (IAG), Lufthansa and Air France-KLM warned that the EU’s 6 per cent SAF requirement for 2030 would be impossible to meet because of the high cost and scarcity of the greener fuel.

Asked to comment, the EU said the current SAF targets are “realistic and feasible”.

Who guarantees that SAF is a climate-friendly solution?

Governments and the International Civil Aviation Organisation require specific certification to prove the sustainability of a batch of SAF and the raw materials needed for its production.

The world’s leading certification scheme is the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), an industry-led initiative that aims to support “sustainable, fully traceable, deforestation-free and climate-friendly supply chains”. EU regulators use ISCC certificates as proof of origin and sustainability of SAF produced and used in the bloc.

Approved third-party auditors are in charge of inspecting SAF plants and their suppliers along the global supply chain, which are then approved by the ISCC following EU standards.

Throughout the different stages of the SAF supply chain, the ISCC requires operators to pass certified information on the origin of raw materials and their carbon savings from one operator to another. But for some feedstocks, tracing their origin can be tricky.

In the case of UCO – the main raw material used in the EU today – suppliers at the point of origin, such as restaurants and individuals, are required to fill out a self-declaration form. The system relies on their honest claim that their product is actually waste oil. So there is some room for fraud, and efforts from airlines and regulators to close any loopholes are key.

Are air ticket prices higher because of SAF?

Some airlines have started passing on the extra costs of SAF to passengers, but for now this remains a small amount. However, IAG warned in 2024 that airfares would need to rise to fund the shift to cleaner fuels.

Air France-KLM and Lufthansa have added mandatory SAF levies to tickets, with the German flag carrier charging up to €72 (S$110) per flight depending on the route and fare, to cover the cost of complying with Europe’s new SAF mandates.

While stopping short of applying a surcharge, British Airways encourages members of its loyalty programme to make voluntary contributions for SAF, enabling them to pay with and earn points.

In Singapore, travellers flying out of the country will pay an SAF levy from 2026, when all departing flights will be required to carry fuel with 1 per cent SAF. Preliminary estimates from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore suggest that economy-class passengers may incur an additional $3 levy for short-haul flights, $6 for medium-haul and $16 for long-haul flights.

A growing number of airlines also offer customers the option to pay a voluntary SAF charge as a way to help offset the carbon footprint of their journey.

Wood said its scope of work on the LBCC project will include redesigning existing processing infrastructure within the refinery to enable production of gasoline with notably reduced sulfur content complying with Colombia’s national targets for cleaner fuels, as well as ambitions to improve national air quality and health.
""This is a major project that will ensure the [Barrancabermeja] refinery continues to be the most sustainable in Latin America,” said Ricardo Roa Barragán, Ecopetrol’s chief executive officer and president.
Wood said it expects the Barrancabermeja refinery will begin first production of lower-sulfur gasoline from the LBCC project by 2030.
Ecopetrol previously undertook a series of major upgrades at Barrancabermeja valued at an overall investment of nearly $780 million in 2021 (OGJ Online, Feb. 19, 2021).","Majority state-owned Ecopetrol SA has let a contract to John Wood Group PLC to provide engineering works for a planned clean-fuels project at the operator’s 250,000-b/d Barrancabermeja refinery in Santander, Colombia.

As part of the June 19 contract, Wood will deliver detailed engineering design for associated upgrades as part of Ecopetrol’s Línea Base de Calidad de Combustibles (LBCC)—or fuel quality baseline—project, which is designed to improve the refinery’s quality of gasoline production, as well the site’s environmental performance, the service provider said.

Wood said its scope of work on the LBCC project will include redesigning existing processing infrastructure within the refinery to enable production of gasoline with notably reduced sulfur content complying with Colombia’s national targets for cleaner fuels, as well as ambitions to improve national air quality and health.

The proposed modifications at the refinery—which, as the nation’s main refining center, is responsible for producing more than 40% of domestically consumed fuels—will also play a critical role in the country achieving its energy transition targets of net-zero emissions by 2050, Wood and Ecopetrol said separately.

By 2030, Colombia’s energy plan calls for producing higher-octane gasoline with a reduced maximum-sulfur level of 10ppm accommodate entry of high-tech vehicles into the national market, as well as contribute to lower emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere.

The LBCC project specifically will ensure compliance with Colombia’s Ministries of Mines and Energy and Environment and Sustainable Development’s Resolution 40444 of 2023, which established a path to improving the national quality of diesel and gasoline to support increased environmental protection and improve health of Colombian citizens, Ecopetrol said in a Mar. 25 release.

LBCC project details

Officially approved by the company’s board in March 2025 at total investment of about $1.2 billion for allocation during the next few years, Barrancabermeja’s LBCC upgrading project will—alongside enabling output of lower-carbon gasoline—also equip the refinery to produce lower-emission hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

""This is a major project that will ensure the [Barrancabermeja] refinery continues to be the most sustainable in Latin America,” said Ricardo Roa Barragán, Ecopetrol’s chief executive officer and president.

“[The upgrading and revamp project will equip the refinery] to achieve greater production autonomy, produce cleaner [and] lighter gasoline, and support the [site’s] decarbonization [efforts in line with] the energy transition,"" Roa Barragán added.

Ecopetrol said internal calculations indicate Barrancabermeja’s LBCC project could reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by about 4.5 million tonnes/year (tpy)—equivalent to planting nearly 207 million trees annually—and help lower Colombia’s overall CO2-equivalent emissions by 5.3%.

The project additionally could reduce emissions of other pollutants such as nitrous oxide (NOx), sulfur oxide (SOx), and carbon monoxide (CO) by about 90,000 tpy, which equates to an emissions-reduction rate for these pollutants of about a 2.7% from current levels, according to the operator.

Alongside spurring economic growth in the region, Ecopetrol said its level of investment in the LBCC project combined with the technical, operational, and logistical complexities involved in the project will also help create new employment opportunities for both skilled and unskilled workers on a regional and national basis.

Wood said it expects the Barrancabermeja refinery will begin first production of lower-sulfur gasoline from the LBCC project by 2030.

It is vital we advance policies which increase flexibility for the market to meet demand while opening the door to American energy affordability.","By Rep. Adrian Smith

As American families make travel plans and assess energy costs for their farms and businesses during the summer, it is as important as ever to champion domestic production of affordable fuels. While gasoline prices in Nebraska are down 5.6 percent from this time a year ago, and diesel prices are down 5.8 percent, tensions around the world put supply chains and energy security at risk. In light of this, policies which embrace the capacity of American biofuels producers to meet demand, such as year-round availability of ethanol blends of 15 percent (E15), are crucial for an all-of-the-above, winning strategy for American energy affordability.

According to Growth Energy analysis, E15 has the potential to save American drivers $20.6 billion in annual fuel costs and generate $66.3 billion for U.S. gross domestic product. My bill with Senator Deb Fischer, the Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act, would end the unnecessary cycle of dependance on summertime waivers from the EPA and permanently allow year-round, nationwide sale of E15. Our legislation does not have the effect of a mandate. It simply removes existing unscientific restrictions on E15 sales.

I am grateful last week the Trump administration rightfully recognized the key role biofuels play in American energy security when the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced its proposed Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) volume requirements for 2026 and 2027. In May, I wrote to President Trump with 25 colleagues calling for timely and robust renewable volume obligation (RVO) requirements, and I look forward to working with EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and the president to ensure these proposed RVO levels have the intended effect of promoting American energy production. If finalized, these RFS volumes will support our agriculture producers, provide much needed certainty to the industry, and ensure consumers have greater access to affordable liquid fuels.

Remarkably, the overall economic impact of the ethanol industry for our state is $8.18 billion—more than 50 times the total impact of the 2024 College World Series, which itself is wonderful for our economy. Because of the importance of biofuels to Nebraska’s economy and energy abundance, I supported inclusion of a provision in the House-passed reconciliation package to extend and improve the 45Z biofuels production tax credit through 2031. This measure directly supports farmers in the Third District and equips producers with the certainty to invest and power the future of sustainable aviation fuel and other clean transportation fuel.

In addition, last week the Trump administration took action to halt production at the EPA’s red tape factory and restore energy abundance. Under Administrator Zeldin, the EPA has proposed a rule to eliminate the previous administration’s “Clean Power Plan 2.0,” which threatened to undermine grid reliability and inflate costs for Nebraskans, who get about half our state’s electricity from coal. Also, President Trump signed into law a resolution I supported which rescinded an EPA waiver granted under President Biden. The waiver permitted the State of California’s electric vehicle mandate which functionally banned the sale of vehicles powered by internal combustion. These Biden-era rules were unworkable, out of touch, and a step backward for American energy.

As co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Biofuels Caucus, I am committed to maximizing accessibility of renewable fuels and flexibility for American producers, consumers, and retailers.

The two companies will work together to set up systems that allow airlines, even those in remote areas, to get this fuel more easily. They will also help airlines understand how to use SAF within the rules that apply to air travel, without affecting their regular operations.

Since not all airlines can get direct access to SAF, ATR and ATOBA ENERGY will also use a system that lets airlines receive credit for using eco-friendly fuel, even if it’s not the exact fuel going into their planes. This system is based on a method that helps companies track and reduce their overall impact on the environment.

ATR’s Chief Executive Officer, Nathalie Tarnaud Laude, said that using cleaner fuel is one of the best ways to cut pollution from flying in the short and medium term. She pointed out that many smaller airlines struggle to get SAF, and this partnership is meant to fix that problem and make the fuel available to airlines all over the world.

Arnaud Namer, the head of ATOBA ENERGY, said he was proud to be part of a plan that gives all airlines a chance to use cleaner fuel. He explained that their method allows airlines, no matter where they are located, to reduce the amount of pollution they cause.

This effort is part of ATR’s bigger goal to make all of its planes ready to run entirely on sustainable fuel by the year 2030. This goal supports international efforts to fight climate change and is being developed with help from local and national governments.

The agreement also aims to improve trust in the aviation industry by sharing clear and accurate information about how this fuel affects the environment. By being open about the fuel’s benefits, ATR and ATOBA ENERGY hope to help more airlines make better choices for the planet.

Following the success of a pilot project in 2023, Air France-KLM and Airbus are strengthening their collaboration with a dedicated SAF fare agreement. Airbus has committed to purchasing SAF options for its employees’ business travel by joining Air France-KLM’s “SAF Corporate” program for the third consecutive year, a program that facilitates the funding and purchase of SAF.

Since the beginning of 2025, Air France-KLM has offered Airbus employees the opportunity to finance a percentage of SAF during the booking process on a selection of routes frequently used by the Group, such as Toulouse-Paris and Toulouse-Montreal, where Airbus has a production facility. This option, visible at the time of booking, aims to raise individual awareness among employees about efforts to reduce CO2 emissions related to business travel.

Since joining the SAF program in November 2023, Airbus has reduced its CO2 emissions by more than 2,000 tons through the purchase of over 670 tons of SAF. This approach offers employees a concrete opportunity to reduce the carbon footprint of their business travel.

Sébastien Guyot, Executive Vice President Global Sales at Air France-KLM, stated: “Reducing our CO2 emissions is a priority for our Group. Sustainable aviation fuel is essential to achieving our ambitions, and the contribution of our corporate customers, like Airbus, is crucial.”

The 45Z production tax credit is critical to putting American energy production and farmers first.
It will help SAF producers establish new markets for farmers to sell their sustainably produced crops, rewarding farmers for their investments in regenerative agriculture.
This is critical to putting America first and securing new opportunities for Iowa farmers.
We are on the cusp of an energy revolution driven by Iowa farmers and biofuel producers.","Being a farmer in Iowa is no easy feat, and the last few years have presented new challenges. The value of Iowa farms was down 3.1% last year due to lower crop prices, increased interest rates, and high labor and supply costs.

If we don’t change course, this will have community-wide effects on the entire ag economy—in Iowa and across the country. Thankfully, supportive federal policy for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production could provide farmers like me new opportunities to stay in the game.

The 45Z production tax credit is critical to putting American energy production and farmers first. It will help SAF producers establish new markets for farmers to sell their sustainably produced crops, rewarding farmers for their investments in regenerative agriculture. For example, when farmers sell their crops as feedstocks to SAF producers, they can expect to earn up to an additional 20 cents per bushel of sustainably grown corn.

Many farmers, including myself, have adopted cutting-edge practices and technologies that allow us to efficiently and sustainably produce more crops per acre while also growing our bottom line. The market incentive to adopt these practices is clear and compelling: beyond the sizable market demand for sequestering carbon, these practices save us valuable time and money relative to more traditional methods.

By leveraging practices like low- or no-till farming systems, improved fertilizer management, and conservation crop rotation, farmers can improve crop and soil health while increasing efficiencies and profitability. This means that even amidst volatile growing conditions, farms are prepared to withstand shock and remain economically viable.

The U.S. House of Representatives, thanks to the leadership of the Iowa delegation, included a provision in its budget bill to extend the 45Z credit through 2031. This is critical to putting America first and securing new opportunities for Iowa farmers. Farmers across the country applaud the House for its support of this credit and urge the Senate to ensure this provision becomes law. Securing this extension would not only allow SAF producers to attract and sustain the financing needed to scale the next generation of aviation fuel. It would also ensure this nascent industry can thrive and support American energy security.

These practices are the future of farming—providing farmers with an economic and environmental edge. In 2023 alone, Iowan farmers earned more than$9.5 billion by selling corn as feedstock to biofuel producers.

American farmers are ready to deliver wins for America and strengthen our domestic energy security, but we need these markets for biofuels like SAF to grow and thrive. These fuels are ready to be used today in existing aircraft and airport fueling infrastructure, simplifying adoption. By helping to launch this nascent industry, policymakers can give American biofuel producers and aviation the competitive edge needed to win on a global stage.

As a third-generation farmer in Iowa, it's essential to find new demand, like SAF, for our corn. Thanks to technological advances and sound farming practices, we continue to raise more corn on fewer acres of land with fewer fertilizer inputs. My son, a fourth-generation farmer on this land, is now farming with me, and it is paramount that we find new markets to use the higher production that we are realizing. Without new markets like SAF, it will be difficult to sustain the next generation in our operation.

We are on the cusp of an energy revolution driven by Iowa farmers and biofuel producers. As Congress acts on required tax legislation this year, it is critical it implements and extends the 45Z credit in that package. Representatives Randy Feenstra, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Ashley Hinson, and Zach Nunn have done their due diligence on the 45Z extension. With continued support from Senator Joni Ernst and Senator Chuck Grassley, Iowa can remain an energy leader while creating new opportunities for our farmers and bolstering our local communities.

In an increasingly turbulent world, Azerbaijan’s air corridors are poised to become enduring lifelines for global connectivity.","The global aviation industry is undergoing a profound transformation as escalating geopolitical tensions and regional conflicts disrupt long-standing East-West air corridors. The full-scale war in Ukraine and rising hostilities in the Middle East have forced airlines to abandon traditional flight routes, resulting in longer journeys, higher operational costs, and increased carbon emissions.

In this environment of uncertainty, the search for stable, efficient, and politically neutral transit alternatives has become an urgent priority for global carriers. Against this backdrop, Azerbaijan has rapidly emerged as a critical aviation link between Asia and Europe. Positioned at the heart of the Eurasian landmass, the country offers not only geographic advantage but also modern infrastructure, diplomatic neutrality, and a clear vision for sustainable and multimodal connectivity. As traditional air corridors unravel, Azerbaijan is positioning itself not as a temporary substitute but as a long-term, strategic hub shaping the future of Eurasian aviation.

The full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 fundamentally altered global aviation patterns. Western airlines, banned from Russian airspace, were compelled to adopt significantly longer routes between Europe or North America and East Asia. This rerouting has had substantial environmental and economic consequences.

Research indicates that these detours led to planes using an average of 13% more fuel compared to their original routes, with flights specifically between Europe and Asia experiencing an even greater increase of 14.8% in fuel consumption. This operational adjustment contributed to a 1% increase in global aviation carbon dioxide emissions in 2023, adding an estimated 8.2 million tonnes of CO2 to the atmosphere. Approximately 1,100 flights per day were affected by these airspace restrictions, underscoring a systemic disruption rather than isolated incidents.

Layered onto the disruptions caused by the Ukraine war, the escalating tensions and direct missile exchanges between Israel and Iran have led to immediate and widespread airspace closures across the Middle East, including over Iran, Iraq, Jordan, and Israel. This has resulted in major disruptions, forcing international airlines to cancel or reroute hundreds of flights. Over 500 flights were cancelled or delayed across major Middle Eastern airports due to these restrictions. Major carriers such as Air India, Qatar Airways, Emirates, Lufthansa, FlyDubai, Etihad, and El Al were significantly affected, with many flights rerouted or even returned to their origin points. This situation, combined with the Ukraine war, effectively closes or severely restricts a second critical East-West corridor, dramatically reducing available safe airspace and forcing airlines into increasingly constrained and circuitous routes.

The immediate diversion of numerous international flights to Heydar Aliyev International Airport (GYD) in Baku during the Middle East airspace restrictions demonstrates Azerbaijan’s role as a reliable haven. Baku Airport explicitly stated its capacity to “safely reroute regional and global air traffic under any emergency circumstances,” possessing “all the necessary infrastructure and operational resources.” This spontaneous rerouting signifies a high level of trust in Azerbaijan’s air traffic control, ground services, and its perceived geopolitical neutrality. It elevates Azerbaijan from a theoretical alternative to a proven, real-time crisis response hub, showcasing its immediate utility and strategic value in volatile times.

Azerbaijan’s emergence as a pivotal East-West air connector is not merely a reactive response to current crises but is rooted in its unique geographical advantages, rich historical legacy, and a carefully cultivated foreign policy. Strategically located at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, bridging the Caspian Sea and the South Caucasus, Azerbaijan naturally positions itself as a critical transit point for goods and people moving between the two continents.

At the heart of this positioning is the “Middle Corridor,” also known as the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route, which stretches across Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, and the South Caucasus into Europe. Azerbaijan forms its crucial central link. The nation’s strength as an air hub is not isolated but is part of a broader, integrated national strategy to become a comprehensive multimodal logistics center, offering seamless transfers between air, rail, road, and sea networks.

Since regaining independence in 1991, Azerbaijan has diligently pursued a foreign policy centered on connectivity and cooperation, consistently emphasizing regional stability. Its commitment to neutrality is a cornerstone of its appeal as a safe transit corridor. Amidst escalating Israeli-Iranian confrontation, Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov explicitly stated that “Azerbaijan will never allow its territory to be used for attacks against friendly states, including Iran.” This declaration of neutrality, coupled with its active participation in organizations like the UN, OSCE, and the Organization of Turkic States, reinforces its commitment to regional stability and cooperation. This proactive approach and sustained commitment to infrastructure development, rather than merely reacting to crises, instill greater confidence in its reliability as a hub.

Azerbaijan’s commitment to becoming a leading aviation hub is visibly supported by substantial investments in modern infrastructure and advanced operational capabilities. Heydar Aliyev International Airport (GYD) in Baku has undergone significant modernization and achieved remarkable growth, solidifying its position as the region’s leading aviation hub. In 2024, the airport served 7.5 million passengers, marking a substantial 31% increase compared to 2023. Transit travel, a key indicator of its hub status, saw exceptional growth, with the number of transit passengers rising by an impressive 130% to 373,383. The airport handled 59,238 flights and expanded its route network to 80 destinations, served by 40 airlines. This growth and operational excellence have garnered significant international recognition, with GYD named the “Best Airport in Central Asia and the CIS” by the prestigious Skytrax World Airport Awards.

Furthermore, the new Alat Cargo Airport, located within the Alat Free Economic Zone (AFEZ), is designed to become a critical multimodal logistics hub, further strengthening Azerbaijan’s position as a key transit point between Europe and Asia. Equipped with state-of-the-art air navigation systems by Indra, it will enhance operational efficiency and ensure flight safety for round-the-clock cargo operations. This airport is strategically located adjacent to the Port of Baku and directly linked to Azerbaijan’s railway and highway networks, facilitating seamless cargo movement across sea, land, and air.

Beyond Baku, Azerbaijan’s commitment to modernizing its air traffic control (ATC) systems and expanding its airport network extends to other regions. Fuzuli International Airport, for instance, built within an impressive eight months, was inaugurated in 2021, serving as Karabakh’s gateway to the world. It features a 3,000m runway, instrumental landing and navigation systems, and an ATC tower equipped with an automated PHOENIX tower system, all complying with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) regulations. Azeraeronavigation (AZANS) serves as the national air navigation service provider, ensuring safe and efficient air traffic services across the country’s airspace.

Azerbaijan’s emergence as a key air transit hub is intrinsically linked to its broader national economic strategy, with aviation serving as a critical catalyst for diversification and sustainable growth. The Azerbaijani government’s strategic focus on air transport reflects its broader goal to diversify the economy beyond its traditional reliance on oil and gas. A State Program is in place to enhance the efficiency of logistics processes, making air transport more accessible and reliable for businesses, aiming to attract crucial foreign investments.

Furthermore, expanding air transport capabilities is expected to bolster tourism significantly. Azerbaijan was indeed the fastest-growing tourism destination among the 30 largest European destinations, recording a 26% increase in air bookings between May 2023 and April 2024 and May 2024 and April 2025. This growing passenger demand complements transit traffic, strengthening the overall viability and profitability of aviation operations.

Azerbaijan has also made sustainability and the transition to a green economy central to its long-term national development strategy. In alignment with this vision, Azerbaijan Airlines (AZAL) has announced a major initiative to explore the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as part of its commitment to reducing carbon emissions and advancing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. AZAL is actively engaging with financial institutions to attract green investment and is developing a comprehensive ESG strategy. It has also joined the International Air Transport Association (IATA)’s CO₂ Connect program, further reinforcing its environmental leadership.

Moreover, AZAL has unveiled ambitious plans to modernize its fleet and enhance operational efficiency, with new Airbus and Boeing aircraft expected by 2032. The airline plans to streamline its fleet by 2030 to include only two models: the narrow-body Airbus A320 Neo family and the wide-body Boeing 787 Dreamliner. This strategic investment in a modern, fuel-efficient fleet will further enhance Azerbaijan’s appeal as a transit hub, offering airlines and passengers access to contemporary and reliable air transport services.

As global aviation navigates a new era of uncertainty and fragmentation, Azerbaijan has emerged not as a peripheral alternative but as a central pillar in reconfiguring East-West air connectivity. Its unique geographical position, coupled with a long-term strategy rooted in neutrality, infrastructure investment, and sustainable development, has elevated the country into a key node in global air transit. The convergence of geopolitical crises—from the war in Ukraine to instability in the Middle East—has underscored the urgency of identifying stable, efficient, and geopolitically neutral corridors.

Azerbaijan’s swift, coordinated response to these challenges, demonstrated through both policy and performance, reveals its growing capacity to anchor regional and intercontinental aviation flows. With state-of-the-art infrastructure, a rapidly expanding airport network, strategic policy vision, and a commitment to green transformation, Azerbaijan is not merely adapting to shifting global dynamics; it is actively shaping them. In an increasingly turbulent world, Azerbaijan’s air corridors are poised to become enduring lifelines for global connectivity.",https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/c-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 14:05:21.669349

It has partnered with Airbus to use Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for all domestic flights of Airbus employees in Germany. This collaboration, which started on June 1, is key to Lufthansa’s climate neutrality goals.

The press release highlights that this partnership uses Lufthansa’s “Sustainable Corporate Value Fare.” This fare helps companies like Airbus offset CO₂ emissions by using SAF in the airline’s fuel operations.

Dieter Vranckx, Chief Commercial Officer of Lufthansa Group, said,

“Together with our customers and strong partners from the industry, we strive towards greater sustainability. I am particularly pleased and thankful that our long-standing partner Airbus has opted for a corporate fare with SAF, demonstrating its leading role also in the field of sustainability. For many companies and its employees, sustainability is becoming an increasingly important factor in travel decisions. As a leading airline group, we are the partner of choice for companies in achieving their goals with tailor-made solutions.”

How It Works: A Smarter Way to Fly Greener

SAF isn’t used directly in individual flights. Instead, it blends with fossil kerosene before reaching airports. As a “drop-in” fuel, SAF fits easily into existing aircraft and fuel systems. Once purchased, Lufthansa ensures that the equivalent SAF related to the customer’s carbon footprint is used within six months.

This method cuts the emissions impact of flying, even if SAF isn’t used on one flight. Over its lifecycle, SAF made from biogenic waste reduces CO₂ emissions by about 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

Airbus Walks the Talk: Making Employee Travel Sustainable

By adopting the Sustainable Corporate Value Fare, Airbus is making employee travel within Germany more climate-friendly. This reflects a growing trend where more companies choose climate responsibility in travel.

Raphael Duflos, Vice President Corporate Services Procurement at Airbus, also noted,

“We have been working in close cooperation with Lufthansa Group since early 2024 to customize their ‘Sustainable Corporate Value Fare’ to meet the specific needs of Airbus travelers. They have helped us to create a meaningful offer incorporating Sustainable Aviation Fuels, starting in the German domestic market. We are confident that such ‘Sustainable Corporate Value Fare’ is going to be successful across the Business Travel ecosystem.”

For Lufthansa, this shows that its climate-focused travel products attract business customers.

Supports SAF to Cut Emissions and Drive Industry Growth

Airbus is using SAF as a key solution to reduce its aviation emissions. It is promoting SAF not just through internal use, but also by forming partnerships and making targeted investments.

Airbus Sustainability

The aviation giant has been using SAF for nearly a decade and aims to cover at least 30% of its internal fuel use with SAF by 2030. This includes fuel for internal transport and employee business travel. Notably, all current Airbus aircraft can fly on up to 50% SAF.

By 2030, the goal is for all aircraft and helicopters to be ready for 100% SAF. New single-aisle models are already being designed with this goal in mind.

Since 2024, Airbus has purchased SAF options from Air France-KLM for employee flights between Paris and cities like Hamburg, Madrid, Marseille, Munich, and Toulouse.

Pilot Projects with Airlines

To help scale SAF use, the company launched two pilot projects last year. One with easyJet funded 106 tonnes of SAF for flights between Toulouse and Bristol using a 30% SAF blend. The trial showed how airlines and corporate partners can share SAF costs and build demand.

Another trial with Wizz Air included over 50 flights using blended SAF, with Airbus providing technical support.

Long-Term Partnerships

Airbus has also partnered with TotalEnergies, which has supplied SAF for aircraft deliveries in Toulouse since 2016. By 2024, TotalEnergies met over half of Airbus’s SAF needs in Europe. They are also working together on research to enable 100% SAF use.

In recent years, Airbus signed agreements with Neste and OMV to expand access to SAF, encourage new demand, and support new production sites. It also invested in LanzaJet, a leading SAF producer, to help speed up the transition across the industry.

Lufthansa’s Climate Targets: Big Ambitions, Concrete Steps

The airline has clear climate goals. It plans to cut net CO₂ emissions from flights by half by 2030, compared to 2019 levels. It also aims for net-zero by 2050 and carbon neutrality in its home market by 2030.

SAF Use Grows Across Lufthansa’s Network

In 2024, Lufthansa cut 71,952 tonnes of fossil CO₂ by using SAF.

The sustainability report shows that the fuel was sourced through co-processing, where biogenic feedstock is refined alongside fossil crude oil. This method helps scale SAF efficiently while maintaining high quality.

Corporate clients can access SAF in two main ways:

Sustainable Corporate Value Fare: Business travelers can offset up to 30% of their CO₂ emissions through SAF.

SAF Bulk Deals: Companies can invest in larger SAF volumes to maximize their climate impact.

Expanding Green Fares for Leisure and Business Travelers

Lufthansa’s Green Fares product expanded in December 2024 to include intercontinental routes. On these flights, 10% of emissions are offset using SAF, while 90% through certified climate projects. For continental routes, the mix is even more ambitious: 20% SAF and 80% offsets.

The response has been modest but is growing. In 2024, about 4% of customers chose Green Fares on continental routes and 1.5% on long-haul flights.

These fares led to a total reduction or offset of 143,000 tonnes of fossil CO₂, with 28,000 tonnes saved directly through SAF.

A Multi-Faced Approach to Sustainability

Lufthansa’s climate strategy goes beyond SAF. It combines technology upgrades, operational efficiency, and better ground logistics:

1. Fleet Modernization: The Group has updated its fleet with new aircraft like the Airbus A320neo, A321neo, A350-900, and Boeing 787-9. These planes have new engines and materials that lower emissions and noise.

In 2024, Lufthansa added 18 new aircraft and retired four older models.

By 2025, 30 more new aircraft are expected.

The modernization plan covers around 240 aircraft. 99.6% of the fleet meets ICAO’s Chapter 4 noise standards.

2. Flight Operation Efficiency: Through smarter routing and digital tools, Lufthansa cut 37,000 tonnes of CO₂ in 2024. Innovations like AeroSHARK surface technology saved 12,000 tonnes of kerosene—enough for 142 roundtrips between Munich and New York with an Airbus A350-900.

3. Alternative Transport to Hubs: Lufthansa has reduced short-haul flights by offering over 750 daily connections via rail or bus. In 2024, over 1.1 million passengers chose these low-emission options, cutting unnecessary air traffic.

4. Offsetting Where Necessary: Besides SAF and fuel savings, Lufthansa and its customers actively offset emissions. In 2024, they offset 606,000 tonnes of CO₂ using high-quality climate projects—531,000 tonnes by customers and 75,000 tonnes from Lufthansa’s travel.

Sustainable Travel Becomes Mainstream

The Airbus-Lufthansa agreement signals a shift in aviation’s approach to travel. With scalable SAF programs, new aircraft, and changing passenger expectations, Lufthansa is positioning itself as a sustainability leader.

Real change needs collective effort. For aviation to meet climate goals, it requires increased SAF production and broader adoption by travelers.

The global market for Carbon-Neutral Fuels was estimated at US$88.4 Billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$126.5 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.2% from 2024 to 2030.

This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions. The report includes the most recent global tariff developments and how they impact the Carbon-Neutral Fuels market.

Why Are Carbon-Neutral Fuels Emerging as a Critical Solution in the Global Energy Transition?

As the global community intensifies efforts to combat climate change, carbon-neutral fuels are gaining prominence as a vital pathway toward decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors. These fuels produced using renewable energy sources and designed to release no net carbon emissions during their lifecycle are increasingly seen as a bridge between existing fossil fuel infrastructure and a fully electrified future. Unlike conventional fossil fuels, carbon-neutral fuels such as green hydrogen, synthetic e-fuels, and biofuels derived from waste biomass can provide a drop-in alternative with minimal modifications to engines, distribution systems, or fueling stations. This compatibility is crucial for sectors like aviation, shipping, and long-haul trucking, where direct electrification remains technically or economically challenging.

Governments and climate pacts like the Paris Agreement are applying pressure through carbon pricing, emissions targets, and clean fuel mandates, incentivizing rapid adoption and innovation in carbon-neutral technologies. With rising global energy demand and growing skepticism over the pace of electrification, carbon-neutral fuels offer a pragmatic, scalable alternative that aligns environmental goals with industrial reality. Furthermore, these fuels can be synthesized using carbon captured from the atmosphere or industrial processes, enabling a closed-loop carbon cycle that supports global net-zero ambitions. As the urgency to act on emissions intensifies, carbon-neutral fuels are moving from concept to commercial deployment, becoming a linchpin in the strategy to decouple energy consumption from carbon output.

What Policy Measures and Market Trends Are Accelerating Adoption?

The policy landscape is evolving rapidly to support the growth of carbon-neutral fuels, with governments, international agencies, and private-sector coalitions all playing pivotal roles. In Europe, the Renewable Energy Directive II and Fit for 55 package mandate a rising share of renewable and low-carbon fuels in transportation, including aviation and maritime sectors. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law offer tax credits and funding for clean hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) projects, while Canada, Japan, and South Korea have unveiled national hydrogen strategies with strong incentives for carbon-neutral fuel development. Carbon pricing mechanisms such as the EU Emissions Trading System are making fossil fuels more expensive to use, indirectly boosting demand for cleaner alternatives.

Meanwhile, corporate commitments to net-zero targets are prompting major logistics, airline, and energy firms to invest in long-term supply agreements for carbon-neutral fuels. International aviation bodies like ICAO are setting SAF adoption targets, while maritime regulators push for low-carbon fuel usage across shipping lanes. Financial markets are also playing a role, with green bonds and climate-aligned investment funds directing capital toward fuel innovation projects.

On the consumer side, increased awareness of carbon footprints is driving demand for sustainable travel and low-emission delivery options, indirectly influencing fuel sourcing. These policy and market shifts are creating a favorable ecosystem for carbon-neutral fuels to scale moving the conversation from niche pilot projects to global industrial deployment, and establishing the regulatory certainty needed for long-term infrastructure investments.

What's Powering the Growth of the Global Carbon-Neutral Fuels Market?

The growth in the carbon-neutral fuels market is driven by several intertwined factors spanning environmental targets, industrial demand, technological viability, and strategic policy support. At the core is the global push toward net-zero emissions, with more than 140 countries and thousands of corporations committing to carbon neutrality by mid-century. This sweeping commitment is translating into direct demand for low-emission alternatives in sectors that cannot easily electrify aviation, marine shipping, heavy manufacturing, and long-haul freight. On the technology side, the rapid maturation of green hydrogen electrolysis, CO2-to-fuel conversion, and biomass gasification is enabling large-scale, commercially viable production pathways.

From an end-use perspective, industries are eager to decarbonize without overhauling existing infrastructure, making drop-in carbon-neutral fuels an attractive proposition. Consumer and corporate behavior is evolving, with rising scrutiny of Scope 3 emissions, greater interest in sustainable sourcing, and ESG frameworks pushing companies to adopt low-carbon fuel solutions. Policy support is equally vital, with tax incentives, fuel blending mandates, infrastructure funding, and clean energy subsidies helping bridge the economic gap between conventional and carbon-neutral fuels.

Additionally, geopolitical concerns over energy security and fuel independence are prompting many nations to invest in local, renewables-based fuel production, reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels. International cooperation through climate accords and technology-sharing partnerships is further accelerating knowledge transfer and deployment. Together, these drivers are not only propelling the carbon-neutral fuels market forward but are also positioning it as a foundational pillar of the emerging global green energy economy.

This step marks a strategic milestone in OMV Petrom’s transition towards sustainable energy solutions.

According to the statement submitted to the Bucharest Stock Exchange, the supply contract spans a five-year period beginning in 2028, with an option for a three-year extension. Deliveries of the pre-treated used cooking oil will commence in 2028, supporting the refinery’s SAF production goals. Pricing for the supply is determined by a formula linked to international market quotations, ensuring adaptability to market dynamics.

OMV Petrom emphasized that the agreement allows for the procurement of up to 0.6 million tonnes of feedstock, with an estimated contract value exceeding EUR 700 million (approximately $803.1 million), based on current market rates. This agreement complements a previous deal signed in June 2024 for pre-treated vegetable oil, enabling the company to secure over 80% of the necessary raw materials for the first eight years of SAF and Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) production at the Petrobrazi facility.

The Petrobrazi refinery, located near Ploiesti in southern Romania, is undergoing a transformation with the construction of a new sustainable fuels plant. The facility, which began development in February, involves an investment of EUR 560 million and is scheduled to become operational in 2028. It will have an annual production capacity of 250,000 tonnes, supplying both SAF and HVO.

This major supply contract underlines OMV Petrom’s firm commitment to developing a long-term, sustainable feedstock supply chain for its low-carbon fuel initiatives. It also aligns with broader industry trends that aim to decarbonize the aviation sector through the use of renewable energy sources.

In terms of financial outlook, OMV Petrom has also demonstrated continued investment momentum. In April, the company approved a capital expenditure budget of 8.1 billion lei (around $1.847 billion or EUR 1.61 billion) for 2025, representing a more than 20% increase compared to the previous year. However, the company reported a net profit of 1.07 billion lei in the first quarter of 2025, marking a 24% decline year-on-year.

As of 14:11 CET on Thursday, OMV Petrom’s shares were trading 0.66% lower at 0.755 lei on the Bucharest Stock Exchange.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-20 16:06:46.896456

Speaking at the biennial Paris Air Show this week Nathalie Tarnaud Laud, chief executive of ATR, said aircraft orders have continued to show a positive trend this year.
Having secured orders for 30 new aircraft so far in 2025, ATR has now sold over 1,900 aircraft since the start of the 72-600 programme.
“We are very optimistic about the commercial performance going forward but still pragmatic when it comes to restoring the supply chain and delivering those aircraft,” Tarnaud Laud said.
Tarnaud Laud said this is “setting a new standard for fuel efficiency and sustainability”.","Regional aircraft manufacturer ATR is preparing for a year of ramping up deliveries of its 72-600s in 2026 following a year of stabilising operations.

Speaking at the biennial Paris Air Show this week Nathalie Tarnaud Laud, chief executive of ATR, said aircraft orders have continued to show a positive trend this year.

Having secured orders for 30 new aircraft so far in 2025, ATR has now sold over 1,900 aircraft since the start of the 72-600 programme. A recent order for 19 from Uni AIR was the largest since 2017.

Tarnaud Laud said this shows the trust customers are placing in ATR which she said it working on improving the product in terms of sustainability and maintenance.

She said ATR has a “really strong pipeline” and the second half of 2025 will ensure it out-performs last year “which was a really good year in terms of orders”.

“We are very optimistic about the commercial performance going forward but still pragmatic when it comes to restoring the supply chain and delivering those aircraft,” Tarnaud Laud said.

“We said at the beginning of the year that 2025 will be a year of stabilisation and I can confirm we are still on track to stabilise the deliveries from last year.

“This year is also a year of preparing for the future. We want to ramp up, that’s very clear. And that’s why we have continued a lot of effort in improving our processes, in the way we work with our suppliers to start that ramp up in 2026.”

Tarnaud Laud added: “When it comes to product improvement for that this year we have decided to launch specifications which will continue to move forward the performance of the aircraft.

“The ATR is one of the most cost-effective aircraft operating on the close to 500 nautical miles. That’s why we decided to invest in a couple of improvements reducing costs and improving the availability of the aircraft.

“We have a few initiatives like reducing the corrosion on the aircraft increasing the checks from two to three years. This is a very important pillar for us and we want to achieve this in a time frame of two to three years.”

Tarnaud Laud said ATR also want to continue the sustainability journey, describing it as being “in the DNA of the company”. “We want to continue to lead the sustainability journey when it comes to regional aircraft.”

ATR is working with engine supplier Pratt & Whitney in two areas. The first is to improve the PW127XT’s fuel efficiency and maintenance costs.

The OEM is also working on alternative fuels including working with Pratt & Whitney on its Able concept for developing hydrogen propulsion.

ATR is also continuing to work on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) having been the first manufacturer to operate a 100% SAF flight in June 2022.

This week ATR signed a deal with French SAF aggregator ATOBA to address the key issue with SAF which is the cost and availability.

Tarnaud Laud said: “When it comes to reginal aviation on one side we are smaller players as customers …and access to SAF is not that easy so they need to join forces with others.

“On the other side you have the producers and, of course they are looking for scale, and they are looking for commitments. We want to work together with ATOBA to bring customers and producers together.”

ATR has achieved the EASA CS-CO2 certification which is based on stringent ICAO efficiency standards.

The 72-600 outperformed regulatory requirements delivering 20% margin beyond required criteria.

As the Senate continues to roll out its versions of the reconciliation bill, there are some differences between the House and Senate proposals when it come to agriculture.

The main variations come down to changes in the tax provisions, but it’s key to note proposed changes to the farm safety net are similar in both the House and the Senate.

What’s Next?

The House and Senate will now need to work out their differences in the two versions of the Big Beautiful Bill. President Trump said he wants to sign the legislation on July 4, but many reports cast doubt Congress can meet that approaching deadline. Politico even reported this week the Senate GOP’s version of the bill is “facing major headwinds in the House.”

Read More: Big, Beautiful Bill: What’s in it for Agriculture?

Farm CPA Paul Neiffer believes the July 4 deadline isn’t likely as the debate heats up, but he still remains optimistic the bill is close to the finish line.

“I think July is the date, but not July 4,” Neiffer says. “They’ll get it done before the August recess. I think they’re actually pretty close. The media out there talks about how they’re really far apart on Medicaid and state and local taxes. But I think when push comes to shove, the president has a lot of clout, and they’ll come up a compromise. So, I’m pretty optimistic they’ll get it done.”

Weighing the Differences Between the Senate and the House

Neiffer says he would grade the Senate’s overall budget reconciliation proposal as a “B” for ag, which is slightly below how he rated the House’s proposal. One reason is what the Senate is proposing for Section 199A:

The Senate has a Section 199A deduction of 20%, while the House’s version is 23%.

Both the House and Senate are calling for 100% bonus depreciation, but the Senate’s would be permanent. The House’s version would expire at the end of 2029.

“With the Senate making that permanent, that’s a really good deal for ag,” Neiffer says. “They would now have some certainty all of the assets that a farmer purchases — combines, tractors, buildings and everything but land — they can deduct 100%.”

Neiffer says another difference is on state and local tax deductions.

The Senate is keeping the current $10,000 deduction and reducing the benefit of the pass-through entity tax deduction.

The deduction is at the $40,000 level in the House and retains the pass-through entity deduction in full for farmers.

Beefed Up Farm Safety Net

Under the Senate’s version, Neiffer says farmers would be paid the higher calculated payment rate under Price Loss Coverage (PLC) or Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC) during the 2025 crop year.

The Senate Ag Committee’s proposal also increases the reference price formula, and instead of having a floor based on 85% of the Olympic moving average marketing year price, the Senate is proposing an increase up to 88%.

“That actually results in a boost on the corn PLC price by about $0.15. And I think on soybeans, it’s about $0.35,” Neiffer says. “So, that’s very beneficial. Now, I was hoping they were going to boost the ceiling. Right now, the ceiling is 115% of the EFR. And they had talked last year about boosting it up to 120%. I think that was too much for the budget, so they kept it at 115%.”

The Differences on 45Z

When it comes to the 45Z Clean Fuels Production Tax Credit, there’s one major difference. The Senate allows foreign feedstocks to be eligible for the credit, just with a 20% “haircut.”

In the House’s version, only feedstocks produced or grown in the United States or Canada qualify for the tax credit. That change would help detour some of the used cooking oil imports from China.

“To me, a 20% haircut means there’s got to be some senators out there maybe pandering to somebody that I don’t know about. Because really, they should eliminate the whole foreign feedstock and just give you a credit based on domestic production,” Neiffer says.

The Bigger Issue with 45Z

Peter Meyer of Muddy Boots Ag says no matter what version of the 45Z tax credit makes the final cut, there’s a bigger issue at hand. The Trump administration needs to provide guidance and rules around 45Z — something the Biden administration failed to do during its time in office.

“We’re just clamoring for clarification, right? All I want is clarification. They can say all they want about extending this to 2030. That’s great. That’s a positive. But tell me what the rules are. We still don’t know the rules,” Meyer says.

Meyer knows there’s been so much talk about 45Z and sustainable aviation fuel, but little action in terms of demand. Meyer says the lack of action in terms of demand is largely because there’s no clarity around the tax credit.

“We need more demand for the ethanol they’re producing,” Meyer says. “Soybean oil can be converted to sustainable aviation fuel. But you just cannot produce sustainable aviation fuel without a credit. You can’t.”",https://assets.farmjournal.com/dims4/default/fa50f97/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x720+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-farm-journal.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff1%2F73%2Fbc32110546e598783ace1a9bcece%2F4a3b34e2eff74d24bc4f64372b05c4d1%2Fposter.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 11:05:43.916077

The business is still in its very early stages

One thing investors need to be aware of is that while there are significant opportunities for Archer, it still has to obtain approval for its Midnight aircraft, and for it to produce it at scale. It has obtained multiple approvals from the Federal Aviation Administration thus far, and the hope is that it may not be too long until the aircraft is cleared for use in the U.S.

But even if that happens, the company still needs to ramp up production. The Midnight aircraft can accommodate four passengers, so the company will need to develop a considerable fleet before it can truly become a big player in the air taxi industry. Its goal is to be producing 650 aircraft per year by the end of the decade. This year, it's aiming to get to just two per month.

Since it's so early in its development, Archer isn't generating any revenue thus far, and its losses have totaled $514 million over the past four quarters. The good news is the business is already seeing strong demand, with a backlog of around $6 billion thus far, including United Airlines, which has ordered 200 of Archer's eVTOL aircraft already, plus an option for 100 more.

Is a valuation of $220 billion a possibility for Archer?

If Archer proves to be a 40x investment, its valuation would need to reach more than $220 billion in the future, given its current market cap of around $5.6 billion. If air taxis truly revolutionize travel and demand for Archer's aircraft takes off, that can be a possibility in the very long run.

But that's a scenario that's also riddled with multiple ifs. The necessary infrastructure needs to be built, and air spaces would become more crowded, which could result in greater legislation and red tape along the way. And with the company still in the early stages of producing its aircraft, it's also difficult to know what kind of margins it will make on them and how profitable the business may or may not be.

A lot of things would need to go right for the business for it to be worth well over $200 billion. Forecasting the future for an industry that's still in its infancy is not easy. And while there's certainly potential for Archer's valuation to grow significantly, investors shouldn't assume that the stock is destined for greatness and that it can generate 40x returns, even over the very long term.

Should you invest in Archer stock today?

Even though investing in Archer may not be a surefire path to becoming a millionaire, it may still be a growth stock worth adding to your portfolio. If you're comfortable with the risk and uncertainty that comes with this business, it could make for a good buy-and-hold investment.

However, given the risk involved, I wouldn't suggest investing more than 5% of your portfolio into the stock. By allocating just a modest amount of money into Archer, you can limit your losses while still giving yourself the possibility to benefit from its growth in the long run.

These deals underscore a global shift toward fuel-efficient, sustainable aircraft as airlines modernize fleets to meet rising passenger demand and stricter emissions regulations. For investors, these companies now offer leveraged exposure to two megatrends: the post-pandemic air travel rebound and the ESG-driven push for decarbonization. Here's why Airbus (AIR) and Embraer (EMBR3) are buys for long-term gains.

Airbus: Dominating Widebody Demand with $21B in Orders

Airbus's $21 billion in orders at the Paris Air Show—driven by Saudi Arabia's 25 A350-1000s and ANA Holdings' A321XLR deal—highlight its dominance in fuel-efficient widebody and long-haul aircraft. The A350 series, which now has over 1,390 orders globally, is the linchpin of this strategy. Its 25% lower fuel burn and full compliance with ICAO's 2027 CO₂ standards make it a must-have for airlines expanding premium routes.

Why It's a Buy:

- Structural Demand: Airlines like Riyadh Air (Saudi Arabia) and EGYPTAIR are prioritizing the A350 to meet long-haul growth and decarbonization targets.

- Zacks Growth Projections: Airbus's revenue is forecast to grow 10.4% annually through 2025, driven by A350 deliveries and expanding A321XLR adoption.

- ESG Tailwinds: Airbus aims for 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) compatibility by 2030—a key selling point as investors demand ESG-aligned assets.

Embraer: Regional Jets and Defense Deals Fuel 15.9% Growth

Embraer's $3.6 billion deal with SkyWest for 60 E175 regional jets (expandable to 110) and its KC-390 defense contract with Lithuania illustrate its dual strengths in commercial and military markets. The E175, a workhorse for short-haul routes, now has a 15-year backlog, while the KC-390 is gaining traction in NATO countries as a cost-effective transport aircraft.

Why It's a Buy:

- Insider Confidence: Embraer's shares surged 5% post-Paris Air Show, building on a 30% YTD gain and 150% rise in 2024. Institutional buying reflects confidence in its execution.

- Zacks Projections: Revenue growth of 15.9% annually through 2025 is backed by strong E-Jet backlog and KC-390's 50+ potential NATO orders.

- ESG Play: The E175's 20% fuel efficiency improvement over older models aligns with airlines' sustainability goals, ensuring long-term demand.

The Broader Investment Case: ESG-Driven Modernization

Both companies are beneficiaries of a $1.2 trillion global fleet modernization wave, as airlines retire older, less efficient aircraft. Airbus and Embraer are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this:

1. Airbus dominates widebody and freighter markets, critical for cargo growth and transoceanic routes.

2. Embraer dominates regional jets and defense logistics, serving underserved markets in Europe and Asia.

Risks to Consider

Supply Chain Delays: Both companies rely on global suppliers; disruptions could delay deliveries.

Regulatory Uncertainty: Emissions targets may shift, though both firms are ahead of compliance curves.

Competition: Boeing's 777X and Embraer's KC-390 face competition, but Airbus and Embraer's order backlogs suggest strong demand.

Investment Thesis

Airbus and Embraer are leveraged plays on rising air travel and ESG-driven fleet upgrades, with structural tailwinds and institutional support. Airbus (AIR) is ideal for investors seeking exposure to premium long-haul demand and SAF innovation, while Embraer (EMBR3) offers higher growth upside via its regional jets and defense contracts.

Recommendation:

- Buy Airbus for its stable cash flows and A350 leadership.

- Buy Embraer for its high-growth regional jet backlog and defense diversification.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-1adc0f6d0e138002.png,N,,2025-06-20 12:11:18.241203

Fortunately for United, encouraging trends in industry profitability and strong demand dynamics are a hedge in themselves, making me bullish on UAL in the second half of this year despite surging fuel prices.

Fuel Hedging Becomes UAL’s Insurance

For those unfamiliar, airline fuel hedging is a risk management strategy using financial instruments—such as futures or swaps—to lock in fuel prices for future delivery. Essentially, it acts as an insurance policy, providing cost stability amid volatile energy markets. Each airline adopts its own approach, adjusting based on broader economic and geopolitical conditions.

For example, Southwest Airlines (LUV) recently ended its once-active hedging program, reflecting a broader shift in the industry. United Airlines, meanwhile, has historically taken a minimal or opportunistic approach to hedging. This strategy is being tested as recent geopolitical tensions—particularly the missile exchanges between Iran and Israel—have pushed crude oil prices up by roughly 20% in the past month.

While oil remains about 8% cheaper year-over-year and has stabilized from its pandemic-era highs, any sharp spike in prices immediately impacts United’s bottom line. Fuel typically accounts for around 25% of an airline’s total operating costs, meaning price increases can significantly compress margins for carriers without substantial hedging in place.

UAL Supplements Hedging with Operational Excellence

It may come as a surprise to those who only interact with airlines as passengers, but the industry operates on razor-thin profit margins. In 2025, the average net profit margin across the sector was estimated at 3.7%, up slightly from 3.4% in 2024. United Airlines performed somewhat better than the industry average, posting a 5.5% profit margin in 2024—a relatively strong showing in such a margin-sensitive business.

Improving profit margins have given airlines like United the confidence to lean more heavily on “natural hedges” against fuel price volatility—strategies that focus on efficiency and sustainability rather than financial instruments. These include operational improvements such as operating newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft, eliminating physical magazines to reduce onboard weight, and utilizing single-engine taxiing to reduce fuel consumption on the ground.

United has been especially proactive in this area, aggressively modernizing its fleet and taking a leadership role in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) initiative to lower emissions and enhance long-term fuel efficiency.

These efforts are beginning to pay off. In its Q1 2025 earnings report, United posted record revenue of $13.2 billion, a 5.4% year-over-year increase, and generated over $2 billion in free cash flow, a testament to the strength of its operational strategy.

Strong Fundamentals Raise Expectations

Reflecting stronger net profit margins across the airline industry in 2025, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) is also forecasting record-high industry revenues. This outlook is supported by projected declines in fuel prices and continued improvements in operational efficiency. In April, global revenue passenger kilometers (RPK)—a key measure of air travel demand—rose 8% year-over-year, signaling robust consumer interest.

While fuel prices have spiked recently, IATA expects conditions to stabilize, projecting an average of $86 per barrel in 2025, down from $99 per barrel last year. With rising demand, falling fuel costs, and ongoing efficiency gains, United Airlines (UAL) may be well-positioned for a strong performance in the second half of the year.

Is United Airlines a Good Stock to Buy?

On Wall Street, UAL earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 14 Buy, one Hold, and zero Sell ratings in the past three months. Its average price target of $100.14 implies 33% upside potential over the next twelve months.

Thomas Wadewitz from UBS is particularly bullish on UAL, having upgraded the stock to Buy and raised its price target from $67 to $105. The analyst cited tariff relief following the 90-day agreement with China.

Moreover, “a more stable economic backdrop and the recent rebound in the U.S. equity market give it increased confidence in the resilience of international and premium revenue, which had been its primary cyclical concern for both Delta and United.”

Navigating Turbulence for Long-Term Gains

While United remains exposed to short-term oil price spikes due to its limited fuel hedging, it has several mitigating strategies in place. If fuel prices ease as expected, United stands to benefit meaningfully. With air travel demand on the rise and strong operational performance—reflected in above-average profit margins and record revenue—United appears well-positioned for further improvement.

That said, investors should closely watch oil price trends, particularly amid ongoing geopolitical uncertainty. Short-term volatility is likely, and those with lower risk tolerance may prefer airlines with more extensive hedging programs. Still, over the long run, strong fundamentals tend to win out. That’s why, despite potential turbulence ahead, I remain bullish on UAL.

“India targets 5 million metric tonnes (MMT) of green hydrogen production capacity by 2030.
There is significant potential to expand green hydrogen capacity to 10 MMT by 2035, if not earlier,” said Dr. Malhotra.
“The discovered cost of green hydrogen production in India is INR 397/kg, including 18% GST.

The agreement was signed by Dr. R.K. Malhotra, President of HAI, and Javier Brey Sánchez, President of AeH2, in the presence of Spanish Ambassador to India Juan Antonio March Pujol. Also present on the occasion was Sujit Pillai, Scientist-F, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE).

The MoU opens up opportunities for collaboration and joint ventures between stakeholders in both countries, aimed at accelerating R&D, production, deployment of green hydrogen technologies, and skilling of manpower as both nations pursue sustainable and affordable energy solutions.

“India targets 5 million metric tonnes (MMT) of green hydrogen production capacity by 2030. The current annual hydrogen demand stands at around 6–7 MMT and is expected to rise to 13 MMT by 2030. There is significant potential to expand green hydrogen capacity to 10 MMT by 2035, if not earlier,” said Dr. Malhotra.

However, cost remains a major challenge. “The discovered cost of green hydrogen production in India is INR 397/kg, including 18% GST. The base production cost is INR 336/kg, excluding storage, transportation, and delivery. If the price can be brought down to INR 250–300/kg, we believe demand across various sectors will rise,” he added.

Brey Sánchez emphasized the MoU’s potential to foster collaboration in developing more efficient electrolyzer technologies and scaling up their manufacturing to drive down costs. Spain, he noted, aims to meet 74% of its industrial hydrogen demand with green hydrogen by 2030 and targets 12 GW of installed electrolyzer capacity by then.

“To reduce the cost of green hydrogen, the partnership through the MoU will combine Spanish technology with Indian manufacturing,” said Brey Sánchez.

The leaders of Hull City Council and East Riding Council have warned that thousands of jobs in the renewable energy sector could be at risk – including hundreds locally – without urgent Government backing.

In a joint letter addressed to Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds and Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander, Councillor Mike Ross and Councillor Anne Handley have stressed the need for strong central Government support for Vivergo Fuels.

The future of the Vivergo plant, based at Saltend Chemicals Park, on the outskirts of Hull, is at imminent risk as a result of the recent UK-US trade deal.

In their letter, the council leaders have outlined the wider impact closure of Vivergo Fuels could have on the region, and how it also raises questions about the Government’s commitment to green energy and its policies to support it.

Cllr Ross said: “Not only is Vivergo Fuels the UK’s largest bioethanol producer, with a crucial role to play in UK transport decarbonisation, but it’s also a strategically important anchor employer in the region.

“It supports over 160 skilled jobs directly and around 4,000 more in the supply chain, the majority of which are based in our Hull and East Riding region.

“The Humber has gained a deserved reputation as a beacon for renewable energy development and production, and we are working extremely hard to attract further investment to the region in emerging technologies, such as hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel.

“This would be immeasurably harder to do if regulatory and financial support are not forthcoming for this business, which has already seen over £700m of private sector investment since 2012.

“The Government’s new UK-USA trade deal has deliberately moved the commercial goalposts, damaging a UK business which invests in the UK and employs UK workers, whilst advantaging American businesses who produce their product overseas.

“Allowing closure of the Vivergo Fuels plant would send a hugely damaging signal to clean energy investors and to any businesses who are considering investing in this region and across the UK.

“The Government has identified clean energy as one of its priority industries and states that its number one focus is encouraging growth, so we now need to see that rhetoric matched with concrete actions and support.

“On behalf of Hull City Council and East Riding of Yorkshire Council, I urge you to act swiftly to secure the necessary support for this business which is of great significance to the residents of our authority and many across our wider region.”

Ben Hackett, managing director of Vivergo Fuels, added: “Vivergo Fuels is a fantastic asset to Hull and East Yorkshire. Not only do we employ a highly skilled workforce and support thousands more jobs in the supply chain, we are a catalyst for further green industrial development and investment which would allow the fuels of the future to be pioneered right here on the Humber.

“We are simply asking the Government for measures that will allow UK ethanol producers to remain competitive in the face of US imports, which benefit from a range of advantages from genetically modified crops to cheaper energy costs.

“We now need to see concrete commitments from ministers in the coming days to safeguard jobs, and protect against the loss of significant investment in the people of this region.”",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5eb0828c5ab0a73ac072de78/5eb7de33257cac76592f068b/6855562f7bbf9150445e4ff0/1750423675493/P2+LEAD.+Vivergo+Fuels+at+Saltend+Chemicals+Park.jpg?format=1500w,N,,2025-06-20 13:08:47.381550

But away from the spotlight, China's commercial aircraft manufacturer COMAC made a quieter yet significant statement that warrants closer examination.

Although the company did not introduce any new aircraft or flight demonstrations, it showcased scale models of its three key projects: the regional C909, the narrow-body C919, and the wide-body C929, which is still in development.

These displays were modest compared to the elaborate presentations by Boeing and Airbus, but they highlighted COMAC's steady progress and long-term aspirations.

COMAC's strategy was pragmatic. The company signed memoranda of understanding with French aerospace group Safran and US-based Crane Aerospace, both related to the C929 program.

While the agreements lacked detailed information, they indicate that COMAC remains receptive to global partnerships, despite increasing US export restrictions on aviation technology.

The C909, formerly known as the ARJ21, is the company's most advanced product. Since its commercial debut in 2016, it has delivered 165 aircraft and is gradually becoming a reliable workhorse.

Lao Airlines and VietJet will operate the jet throughout Southeast Asia by 2025, joining Indonesia's TransNusa. These three carriers now fly 15 routes to 18 cities in the region.

The C909's advantages lie in its ability to perform well under challenging conditions. Its design is well-suited for short runways and high-temperature environments, allowing access to smaller airports – an important factor for emerging markets with limited infrastructure.

The C919, designed to accommodate 158 to 192 passengers, reflects China's ambition to penetrate the core market long dominated by Boeing and Airbus. It aims to compete with the Boeing 737 MAX and the Airbus A320neo.

So far, 20 aircraft have been delivered to Chinese airlines, with orders for over 1,000 planes placed.

Its fuel efficiency surpasses that of its peer models by 15 percent, and it can operate using up to 50 percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), aligning with growing environmental standards.

However, there are restrictions on plans for global expansion. Most overseas markets don't allow the C919 without FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) or EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency) certification.

Efforts are underway, however, with European safety authorities reviewing the aircraft. A decision may be delayed until 2028.

Still, COMAC's progress in Southeast Asia suggests another path. Vietnam is adapting to China's CAAC (Civil Aviation Administration of China) certification for the C909.

Such bilateral arrangements may offer a shortcut to market access in regions less bound by US or EU regulatory frameworks.

Another key challenge is engines. Both the C909 and C919 rely on Western engines – the GE CF34 and the CFM LEAP-1C.

The recent US restrictions on engine parts cast doubts on future supplies. COMAC is testing its domestic alternatives: the CJ-1000A for the C919 and the more powerful CJ-2000 for the future C929. These projects are not yet complete, but they represent a serious investment in long-term self-reliance.

How does the move affect global travelers and airlines?

First, more carriers may explore Chinese aircraft as alternatives to more expensive Western models. For passengers, that could mean lower fares and more direct connections between poorly connected cities.

Second, China's pursuit of green aviation – such as SAF-capable aircraft – aligns with broader industry goals. As airlines seek to meet carbon reduction targets, these capabilities will be increasingly valuable.

The path ahead is long. Market trust, certification, and production scale remain obstacles. But COMAC is not looking for overnight disruption.

Its approach seems more patient: establish a presence in surrounding markets, provide trustworthy service, and gradually expand globally.

Leaders convened in Canada this week for G7 meetings. Climate was not a major focus, but governments agreed to boost global co-operation on wildfire mitigation, including through sustainable forest management and nature-based solutions. They also backed a Critical Minerals Action Plan aimed at ensuring resilient supply chains for “digital and energy secure economies”.

However, the summit was overshadowed by the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, which prompted an early departure by US President Donald Trump.

The rise of global oil prices on the back of the conflict is being used by some commentators to push the need for a renewables-based power system. Jess Ralston, analyst at UK-based think-tank the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said “energy independence will come from building out renewables, insulating homes and replacing gas boilers with electric heat pumps as well as moving to electric vehicles . . . we can’t afford to remain as vulnerable the next time oil and gas prices spike”.

Temperatures are also soaring, with the UK’s Met Office warning that people should try to get used to the hot weather. A study from the UK’s national weather and climate service shows the chance of temperatures hitting 40C is 20 times more likely than it was in the 1960s.

Person in the news

A common theme across all our stories this week is, whether we like it or not, President Trump.

While the world waits to see if he will, or not, bomb Iran, his domestic policies and long-arm lobbying are influencing what happens, or rather does not happen, in terms of climate action and the energy transition globally.

One area where Trump’s policies are having an impact is the global EV market. On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order to quash the target implemented by his predecessor Joe Biden of making 50 per cent of vehicles sold in the US electric by 2030, and froze $5bn in unspent federal funding reserved for building EV charging stations.

And he has not stopped there. He is now looking to withdraw a consumer tax credit of up to $7,500 for purchasing US-made EVs, introduced by Biden in 2021 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, and is proposing an $250 annual fee for EV owners.

Such changes could present a significant opportunity for the production of EVs in other markets, including the EU. But, European car manufacturers are also upping the pressure on the European Commission to scale back its climate ambitions.

Elsewhere, US-headquartered companies and industry associations have turned their lobbying attentions to the EU Methane Regulation, which imposes financial penalties on oil and gas companies whose imported fuels exceed methane intensity limits established by the EU.

Research by non-profit InfluenceMap shows American companies are trying to leverage the commission’s “omnibus” simplification package to weaken the rules.

This pushback comes as scientists have once again warned that the possibility of limiting warming as agreed under the Paris Agreement is increasingly unlikely.

Trump also came into office promising to bring peace, even suggesting himself as a Nobel Peace prize candidate. However, with governments everywhere increasing defence spending in the face of mounting uncertainty, it is hard to see how his interventions are making the world a safer place.

Europe

Representatives from more than 30 aviation companies have signed letters to EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra, national energy and transport ministers, and other senior EU officials calling for more funding for sustainable aviation fuel produced with renewable energy. The letter calls on national governments to commit funding jointly to an e-SAF pilot tender, using a double-sided auction mechanism, to kick-start the market and meet the demands of the EU’s SAF mandate, which requires EU flights to use an increasing volume of SAF in their fuel mix.

Global oil demand is still on track to peak before the end of the decade despite recent geopolitical disruptions, is the conclusion of the Paris-based International Energy Agency’s 2025 oil report. Growth in EVs and renewable energy are central to slowing demand, the report said. Meanwhile, the petrochemical industry is set to become the dominant source of oil demand growth from 2026 onwards. The industry is on track to consume one in every six barrels of oil by 2030, the report added.

Following on from its REPowerEU road map, the European Commission has put forward a legislative proposal to end its dependence on Russian oil and gas. Russian gas imports under new contracts will be prohibited as of January 1 2026. Existing short-term contracts will be stopped by June 17 2026, while contracts for landlocked countries and long-term deals will be allowed until the end of 2027. Russian oil imports are forecast to stop by the end of 2027. Member states will be required to present plans for the elimination of Russian oil and gas imports.

Meanwhile, the European Council has adopted its position on a draft vehicle recycling regulation that would require all vehicles to be designed with end-of-life recovery, reuse and recycling in mind. The proposal introduces targets for recycled plastic content in vehicles and opens the door for the commission to adopt targets for other recycled materials in the future.

The council has also agreed its position on the commission’s proposal to “stop the clock” on provisions of the EU Batteries Regulation, by delaying implementation of the rule’s due diligence requirements for two years.

Lawmakers in the European parliament and council have reached a provisional agreement on proposals to simplify the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. The institutions supported the commission’s proposal to exempt importers of less than 50 tonnes of carbon a year, saying it would ease the regulatory burden on individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises. The co-legislators also agreed on a number of technical amendments to the rules, including changes to its authorisation procedure and requirements regarding the collection and verification of emissions data. The agreement must now be formally endorsed by the two institutions, with adoption of the changes expected by September.

The Spanish government has published its first report into the cause of the blackout on the Iberian peninsula in late April. The outage was caused by surging voltages resulting in “a chain reaction of disconnections” shutting down the power network, the report stated. Both the grid operator and electricity companies were responsible, said Spanish energy and environment minister Sara Aagesen on Tuesday. She also defended the country’s commitment to increase renewable energy capacity, which some had wrongly speculated was the cause of the blackout.

Keeping with Spain, the EIB Group — made up of the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund — has signed a €250mn sustainable finance agreement with Santander to support the green transition of small Spanish businesses and mid-cap companies, and promote female entrepreneurship. The deal also allocates €50mn to strengthen the nation’s agricultural sector through investment in sustainable and regenerative agriculture, climate-resilient crops, water management and support for young and new farmers.

Elsewhere in Europe, Norway has announced the launch of its flagship full-scale industrial carbon capture and storage project, Longship. The launch follows the first shipment of carbon dioxide earlier this month from a plant owned by German cement giant Heidelberg Materials in Brevik, Norway, with offshore injection beneath the North Sea set to begin in August. The Norwegian Ministry of Energy also announced that it had approved plans to expand the project’s Northern Lights facility, a joint venture between oil companies Shell, Equinor and TotalEnergies. The expansion, which seeks to raise the project’s annual transport and storage capacity to at least 5mn tonnes from 1.5mn tonnes, is slated for completion in the second half of 2028.

UK

The government has published guidance on environmental impact assessments for North Sea oil and gas drilling. The rules are in line with the 2024 Supreme Court “Finch” ruling that requires Scope 3 emissions from new oil and gas projects to be considered in assessments. Oil majors seeking to develop the Rosebank oilfield and Jackdaw gasfield can now reapply for licences. Tessa Khan, executive director of non-profit Uplift, said the guidance, published in response to a government consultation, means oil and gas companies “will finally be forced to come clean over the enormous harm they are causing to the climate”.

Environment secretary Steve Reed has said he is “stepping up” preparations for the potential temporary nationalisation of water company Thames Water. He will also reject demands from the company’s creditors for more leniency on environmental laws. Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, Reed said it is “only right” Thames Water is subject to the same consequences as any other water company. The government has also confirmed that more than £100mn in fines from polluting water companies will be reinvested in local environmental clean-up projects.

In other water news, the UK’s Environment Agency has warned England’s public water supply could be short by 5bn litres a day by 2055, a third of daily use, without urgent action. Climate change, population growth and environmental pressures are increasing water stress, said the agency. It has also published its five-yearly report the National Framework for Water Resources, which outlines what water companies, regulators, businesses and the public must do to best manage water usage into the future.

Meanwhile, the UK government has committed £7.9bn in funding for flood defences, in what it said is “the largest flooding programme in history”. The funding will be used for flood barriers and nature-based solutions such as wetland restoration. Every £1 spent on flood defences is expected to prevent around £8 in economic damage by the government.

The government has also announced a £500mn investment in regional hydrogen transport and storage infrastructure. The network is intended to connect hydrogen producers with end users such as power stations and industrial offtakers.

Publicly owned energy company Great British Energy, the Crown Estate and industry have joined the government in a £1bn public-private investment package in offshore wind supply chains. The £300mn from GBE, first announced in April, will be met with £400mn from the Crown Estate, and £300mn from the offshore wind industry. The funding will support turbine manufacturing facilities and associated infrastructure, including ports.

The UK is the leading EV market in Europe, shows BloombergNEF’s annual Electric Vehicle Outlook. In 2024, EVs made up 29 per cent of passenger vehicle sales in the UK, ahead of France (27 per cent) and Germany (13.9 per cent). EV uptake in the UK is accelerating faster than the global average and expected to hit 64 per cent of passenger vehicle sales by 2030, compared with 42 per cent globally, the report said. Globally, EV sales will reach almost 22mn, up 25 per cent from 2024, due to the falling cost of lithium-ion batteries and the availability of more affordable EV models, BloombergNEF said.

A group of 16 investors representing more than $795bn in assets under management has issued a public statement calling for high-emitting companies to take stronger action on air pollution. Co-ordinated by UK-based responsible investment non-profit ShareAction, the investor group warned that corporate air pollution is underestimated in financial risk assessments and corporate sustainability strategies, and presents a public health risk. Signatories include Achmea, Nest and Ethos Foundation.

The High Court of England and Wales has ruled a giant poultry farm due to be developed in Shropshire will have its planning permission revoked for failing to account for the environmental impact of industrial chicken farming, specifically the impact on rivers. The case was brought against Shropshire Council by a local campaigner, Alison Caffyn, who sits on the board of non-profit River Action. The judge ruled the planning authorities must assess the cumulative impacts of having multiple intensive agricultural developments in one river catchment and the management of waste from livestock production, including treatment facilities.

The long-delayed high-speed rail line HS2 has again been pushed back, with transport minister Heidi Alexander blaming “mismanagement” by the previous Conservative government. A new completion date for the project has not been given, but the government said it will be after 2033.

US

The Senate finance committee published its contribution to the “big, beautiful bill” on June 16, with additional cuts to Medicaid funding and eligibility, and slightly more flexible changes to green energy tax credits than those set out by the House. The text deletes a measure that would have required renewable energy projects to begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment to qualify for the credits, giving developers a year. It also introduces a more phased approach to their removal, and adds further carve-outs for hydropower, nuclear and geothermal projects.

A “subnational delegation” will take the place of the federal government at major international events including London Climate Action Week and the Paris Agreement anniversary. A joint announcement from groups including America Is All In and Climate Mayors said state and municipal leaders will fill the void left by the Trump administration. “Local leaders in the US have demonstrated their unique ability to move further and faster on climate progress,” said Climate Mayors executive director Kate Wright.

Oregon lawmakers have passed a bill directing the Oregon Investment Council and state treasurer to take further steps to address the risks climate change poses to workers’ retirement savings. The bill is the first of its kind in the US and follows similar bills in Oregon, New York and California to integrate sustainable investing principles into state pensions. The state will be required to report on and analyse emissions from public pension investment portfolios, reduce the fund’s carbon footprint, and report every other year on progress.

A federal judge has ruled the Trump administration’s move to terminate $600mn in environmental justice grants was illegal. The grants, issued under the Inflation Reduction Act, were provided to low-income communities. The judge said the Environmental Protection Agency exceeded its authority in cancelling the grants “precisely because they are ‘environmental justice’ programmes”, and that it lacked “reasoned decision-making”.

The US administration has said it will close climate.gov, the gateway website for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s climate programme office. For 15 years it has been a resource of public information about climate change. In June, nearly all of its staff were fired and those remaining were told the website will not publish new content.

Legislators failed to get New York state’s proposed climate disclosure bill through the Senate before the legislative calendar closed for the year. Senate bill S3456 was debated, but the session ended without agreement. Business groups had written to governor Kathy Hochul, claiming the rules would have expectations of businesses that many “lack the resources or technical capacity to do”. The bill is expected to be reintroduced in the next session — in January 2026 — which would push back compliance by another year.

Africa

UK-based clean energy company Octopus Energy has launched the Octopus Energy Power Africa Fund, which will initially invest in rooftop solar and battery storage in sub-Saharan Africa. The fund is starting with an initial $60mn and seeks to mobilise $250mn over the next three years. Africa’s energy market is one of the fastest-growing globally, driven by an unmatched abundance of sunshine and wind, said Octopus.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/c56ebd12-47fc-4e81-afd7-72bfcb92d341.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 09:05:48.966927

Poland wraps up CBAM changes with European Parliament

Brussels, 18 June (Argus) — Poland has concluded negotiations on behalf of EU member states with the European Parliament for a revised carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), ahead of handing over the bloc's six-month rotating presidency to Denmark at the end of June. But Warsaw will not lead discussions on the EU's emissions cut target for 2040 and the bloc's updated nationally determined contribution (NDC) to the Paris climate agreement. Leading negotiations for EU states with parliament, Poland's deputy climate minister Krzysztof Bolesta said the revised CBAM would exempt 90pc of originally covered EU companies from reporting obligations, while 99pc of emissions embedded in imported products would remain covered. The agreement on CBAM now has to be formally approved by parliament and EU ministers. Once published in the bloc's official journal, the revised CBAM text will exempt importers that do not exceed a new single mass-based threshold of 50 t/yr of imported goods. Bolesta admitted that progress has been held up on concluding the EU's NDC during Warsaw's presidency of EU ministerial meetings. CBAM was also listed by Bolesta as one of the points for flexibility in discussions on the 2040 climate target, alongside carbon credits under Article 6 of the Paris agreement, additional funding and flexibility between climate sub-targets. At a meeting of environment ministers yesterday, Bolesta indicated that most states still favour the European Commission linking its submission of an EU NDC to the UN — which includes a 2035 emissions cut target — with the bloc's planned 2 July proposal for a 2040 EU climate target. The CBAM yesterday contributed to delays in technical negotiations held in Bonn, Germany, for the UN Cop 30 climate conference in Brazil. The Like-Minded Group of Developing Countries, including countries such as Bolivia, China, Saudi Arabia, Cuba and Vietnam, had urged the need to address concerns ""with climate change-related trade-restrictive unilateral measures"". Despite ""very, very divergent views"", EU member states agree that it ""is absolutely urgent to come up with an NDC before the end of September"", Bolesta said. The Polish presidency of the EU, chairing climate ministers' meetings, has advanced NDC work as much as possible in the absence of the commission's proposal to revise the bloc's climate law. ""We really have only a couple of months to come up with something. What lacks in the NDC draft is now the headline target,"" Bolesta said. Countries have not yet discussed the quality of Article 6 offsets, Bolesta added. ""Everyone in the room realises that we need to be very stringent on what kind of offset will be let into the system,"" he said. EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra is ""cautiously optimistic"" that a landing ground can be found on the 2040 climate target. He called for more assertive climate diplomacy, as a large part of the problem lies outside Europe. For China, Hoekstra noted unfair trade practices and ""serious"" concerns about plans to build additional coal-fired plants. ""It's a mixed bag. And we invite them to step up their ambition,"" he said. By Dafydd ab Iago Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025. Argus Media group .

Data centre power grab worries H2 sector

Data centres are locking in deals with suppliers, as H2 projects struggle to get off the ground, writes Stefan Krumpelmann Hamburg, 17 June (Argus) — The global hydrogen sector is not short of problems that are keeping it from lift-off. To that list can now be added a surge in competition from data centres for clean power, key equipment and engineering services. For some technology providers in the hydrogen sector, the big data boom presents opportunities. Fuel cell manufacturers say they are seeing interest in back-up power from data centre operators, for example. But there is growing consensus that data centres will outcompete hydrogen projects for key resources. Power — especially from renewables or nuclear — is the most obvious area of competition. While hydrogen projects struggle to get off the ground for a multitude of reasons, data centres are gobbling up large amounts of power under long-term contracts. Over the past month alone, US technology giant Meta has signed deals for 650MW of solar power in Texas and Kansas from utility AES and 1.1GW of nuclear power from utility Constellation, while entering a co-operation agreement with Houston-based XGS Energy to develop a 150MW geothermal project. Rising power demand and prices have held back numerous US electrolysis projects, electrolyser and fuel cell maker Bloom Energy's executive vice-president and chief commercial officer, Aman Joshi, said last year — before the US hydrogen sector was rocked by President Donald Trump's return to the White House. Such competition is increasingly evident elsewhere too, including in Latin American countries with high hopes for hydrogen, but where progress has been sluggish. ""If hydrogen doesn't take the renewable power from LatAm, data centres and crypto will,"" Inter-American Development Bank's lead energy specialist, Christiaan Gischler, said at last month's World Hydrogen Summit in Rotterdam. Electricity prices for renewable hydrogen projects that are planning to draw on grid power have shot up because data centres will pay more, Australian developer InterContinental Energy's chief executive, Alexander Tancock, says. Global data centre power consumption could more than double to 945 TWh/yr by 2030 from about 415 TWh/yr as artificial intelligence use grows rapidly, Paris-based energy watchdog the IEA said in April. Much of this rise would be driven by the US, where data centre demand could eclipse the power consumption of all energy-intensive industries combined by the end of this decade, the IEA forecasts. Big data's growth could make it harder to secure key equipment too. Lead times for key items have already lengthened as equipment is reserved for data centre installations, engineering, procurement and construction firm Black & Veatch's senior vice-president and managing director for Europe, Middle East and Africa, Youssef Merjaneh says. Major manufacturers' order books are full until 2028 for equipment such as switchgears, transformers and gas turbines, he says. Developers are feeling the pinch. Transformer lead times have risen to three years from two, France-headquartered Lhyfe's manager for the Benelux region, Adriaan van Hoeken, says. A skilled worker shortage could be another hurdle. Only a fraction of announced hydrogen projects will be built, at least in the near term, which could alleviate previous concerns about staffing bottlenecks. But the workers might instead be needed elsewhere, such as in data centre development. Merjaneh estimates that 35-40GW of data centre additions are planned until 2030, while existing engineering capacity would only support 10-15GW.

Q&A: Suburban's renewable quest continues

London, 17 June (Argus) — US LPG distributor Suburban Propane was the first company to sell a propane-renewable DME (rDME) blend in California in 2022 . The company has also pioneered sales of biopropane in the US and has since expanded into renewable natural gas (RNG) — also called biomethane — and hydrogen. Argus spoke with Suburban's vice-president of renewable energy, Douglas Dagan, about the push into renewables and the challenges ahead: Could you provide an update on Suburban's renewable DME sales? We continue to have a strategic partnership with Oberon Fuels , which produces rDME in the US. We are the only commercial seller of a propane-rDME blend — right now we sell to all of our forklift truck and autogas customers from our Anaheim, California, location. The product is a true drop-in replacement that can be used in all propane applications. The blend ratio is currently small, but we are testing higher percentages to determine the maximum drop-in blend level. We received an exemption from the California Air Resources Board [CARB] to run a pilot testing higher blend levels in vehicles. What is the current blend ratio and what is the maximum you are looking at? Our commercial blend is 4pc rDME. This ensures no issues as a drop-in replacement. We want to get to a 10pc maximum, but we've done a lot of testing and are delivering at 4pc in the Anaheim market. We are confident there are no issues on the customer side when a 4pc blend is used in an engine. Now we're looking to assess higher blend percentages. Getting CARB pilot approval was the first step. Why has the maximum fallen from previous estimates of 20pc and then 12pc? RDME has a lot of potential, but it's more challenging than anticipated. We started testing before the World Liquid Gas Association [WLGA] did. The belief was you could blend up to 20pc and everything would work. It turns out it's more like 10pc — lower than hoped — which means environmental benefits don't scale as fast. You have to ensure no issues arise from the oxygen content in DME, such as seal degradation causing leaks. There must be a high degree of confidence. On the supply side, different blend ratios require dedicated tanks and infrastructure — you can't switch between 4pc and 20pc easily — so it's very costly to have more than one blend. What are the latest in terms of your renewable propane sales? We are rapidly scaling — we've sold over 1mn USG [1,900t] of renewable propane in California, where we primarily offer renewable propane. Several programmes support renewable propane, but California credits are the most lucrative. We will sell outside California and are exploring expansion. The biggest challenge is availability. Many producers don't yet see value in separating renewable propane from the stream — it's a by-product, from renewable diesel or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production. We're building relationships to say: we have demand, and we'll pay. We just need more of it. How does Donald Trump's presidency and the resulting pressures on the regulatory environment for the energy transition affect Suburban's renewable plans? I think the Trump administration is supportive of what we're doing. It has different priorities from the Biden administration, but we still see support at both state and federal levels for our traditional product. On the renewable side, we're developing drop-in renewable propane, as well as RNG and clean hydrogen. There's support for all three. A Trump priority is domestic industry, and our plans are heavily domestic. Every administration brings new challenges. Lack of certainty is the biggest — knowing future policies is hard. Luckily we have a traditional product and a renewable platform that have support from both parties and we think the outlook for the future is good regardless of which party is in control. Can you explain why the carbon intensity (CI) metric could be an important tool for policy makers? It's a critical metric, though a bit technical. Policy makers deal with many issues — energy is just one. But the more people understand CI, the better the decisions. The CI scale, developed by Argonne National Lab, is a full life-cycle emissions calculation, covering production and use. Electric vehicles [EVs] are often seen as cleanest, but not always. CI reveals this — the lower the better. For example, if the electricity grid is dirtier than gasoline, switching to EVs worsens emissions. In most US states, the grid is dirtier than traditional propane. Gasoline and diesel score about 100, traditional propane around 80, and renewable propane 20-40. Suburban is moving into hydrogen and RNG. Is this a diversification strategy or do they somehow complement the core LPG business? We have a large RNG facility in Arizona using dairy manure and co-feed from organic waste. We can produce 1,000–1,500mn Btu/d of RNG sent via pipeline to California for engine fuel. Its CI score is a little better than minus 350 — phenomenally clean. We're building a new facility in upstate New York, and upgrading one in Columbus, Ohio, that uses food and organic waste. We're also evaluating other RNG opportunities. But we're also growing our LPG business. RNG is a great product — and part of a strategic platform. Digesters make biogas, which becomes RNG. But raw biogas can also be used to make rDME and renewable propane. And RNG can make clean hydrogen — or rDME/renewable propane that can be transported and reformed into clean hydrogen on site. These are all interconnected. Will the company retain its core focus as a propane supplier? Yes. Propane is a unique energy source that will remain critical. Many customers are in areas where large-scale grid decarbonisation isn't feasible, so propane as distributed energy is vital. [And] more extreme weather events take down grids. Propane is resilient — useful for heating, cooking and generating electrons to power EVs where the grid can't meet demand. If emergency EVs run on electricity and the grid fails, you need another way to generate electrons. [So, propane has a lasting role.] Have Suburban's traditional propane sales been pressured by warmer winters? Winter 2024–25 was much colder than the record-warm winter a year earlier, which had lowered demand. This winter, heating demand climbed and sales increased. But our strategy doesn't rely on cold weather. We're growing non-weather-related demand via traditional and renewable platforms — especially for engines and back-up power. Our goal is to grow both platforms and deploy capital for the greatest returns. What are your hopes for the rest of this year for the renewables business? We plan to keep growing RNG production. Output is rising at our Stanfield [Arizona] facility and the other two mentioned. We're also exploring hydrogen opportunities and expect that segment to grow. For renewable propane and DME, we've seen tremendous recent growth — especially in renewable propane. We're pursuing more supply and new markets outside California. Reaching 1mn USG in sales was a big milestone — and we want to keep building on that this year. Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025.

The aviation industry’s push toward net-zero emissions by 2050 has placed Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) at the center of its decarbonization efforts. While feedstock availability remains a critical challenge, Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) or biomethane is emerging as a promising feedstock.

RNG, a pipeline-quality biogas, offers the potential to scale SAF production by utilizing established gas-to-liquid (GTL) technologies, such as SynCOR™ autothermal reforming and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis. This approach combines proven processes with innovative adaptations, creating a high-carbon-efficiency pathway for SAF production. With demand for SAF growing globally and new mandates driving its adoption, RNG could unlock a more sustainable, scalable future for aviation.

Introducing RNG and its potential as a SAF feedstock

RNG (or biomethane) is a purified form of biogas derived from organic waste sources such as agricultural residue, food waste, or wastewater treatment. Upgraded to meet the quality standards of fossil natural gas, RNG is pipeline-compatible and can be used as a direct substitute for traditional natural gas. RNG has great potential to serve as a renewable feedstock for producing SAF due to its renewable origin and compatibility with existing infrastructure.

RNG can either be used locally on-site, primarily as a fuel or for power generation, or injected into natural gas distribution pipelines for broader regional export. For SAF production, pipeline distribution is the more practical option. It enables access to sufficient RNG volumes to supply large-scale production facilities, where economies of scale become viable for output exceeding 2,000 barrels per day of liquid fuels.

RNG can help meet demand

The potential for increased RNG production is significant in both the U.S. and Europe. According to the ICF – American Gas Foundation (2019), the U.S. could produce between 1,500 and 6,500 trillion Btu of RNG annually by 2040. In Europe, the European Commission aims to boost production from 3 billion cubic meters in 2022 to 35 billion cubic meters by 2030.

Meanwhile, SAF demand is expected to grow steadily to meet aviation’s net-zero carbon emissions commitments by 2050. SAF mandates are advancing in the EU and UK, and earlier this year, the U.S. introduced federal blenders tax credit guidance. Other countries, including Japan, Singapore, India, Brazil, Indonesia, and Malaysia, are also making strides to drive domestic SAF adoption. In short, RNG has the potential to play a critical role in supporting SAF production targets, enabling the scale-up needed to meet these ambitious goals.

Alternatives for SAF production from RNG

RNG is a biological feedstock with properties equivalent to fossil-based natural gas, so the first step in leveraging RNG for SAF production involves examining technologies previously used to convert natural gas into liquid fuels (GTL).

The Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process has been the primary technology used in GTL plants at a commercial scale. Two key GTL technology routes have been successfully deployed. Thes first is the integrated Sasol’s GTL technology, as applied among others in Oryx GTL Qatar and Uzbekistan GTL. This uses Topsoe’s low steam-to-carbon SynCOR™ autothermal reforming to convert natural gas and oxygen into syngas, followed by Sasol’s LTFT™ low-temperature FT process in the slurry reactor technology to produce synthetic hydrocarbons like diesel and kerosene (jet fuel).

The second is Shell’s GTL technology, as applied in Pearl GTL Qatar, which converts natural gas and oxygen into syngas through partial oxidation, steam methane reforming, and fixed-bed FT reactors with cobalt-based catalysts.

Current alternatives for SAF production from RNG could be grouped in two main routes. Fischer-Tropsch based process producing jet-fuel as per D7566 A1 and syngas to ethanol to jet based process producing jet-fuel as per D7566 A5.

Approaches

From previous experience, autothermal reforming, such as SynCOR™, is considered among the best technologies for gas-to-liquid (GTL) processes. Operating at a low steam-to-carbon ratio, it produces syngas with the optimal H₂/CO ratio for FT synthesis and supports large-scale single train capacities.

GTL plants have traditionally been developed to operate in remote locations in island mode while maximizing plant capacity. Considerations applied in the gas-to-liquid plants are not necessarily all applicable in an RNG based concept, where reduction of carbon emission and maximizing carbon efficiency is a key aspect of the design. By improving process efficiency and using renewable energy along with reducing carbon-rich off-gases for heating and utility needs, RNG concepts can achieve these goals.

Case study provides proof point

In a recent case study, several process adaptations were implemented to maximize the carbon efficiency of the fuels plant. These types of RNG based facilities are conceptualized at lower capacities and more integrated in existing power and utility networks. This eliminates the need for an island design approach.

A key step change is the ability to utilize carbon-rich off-gases within the fuels production process, which boosts carbon efficiency and reduces the overall carbon intensity of the fuel system.

The SynCOR™ design replicates the layout of a traditional GTL plant while incorporating necessary adjustments by modifying the unit’s operating conditions. As a result, the core design and equipment of an RNG-based fuels plant closely resemble those of a fossil-based GTL plant.

GTL process adaptation

To maximize the utilization of carbon-rich off-gases within the process, the operating steam-to-carbon ratio of the SynCOR™ unit is adjusted to produce syngas with a hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide ratio of 2.0 – adequate for FT processes. Additional external hydrogen could further enhance carbon utilization within the process.

Superheated steam requirements are minimized and generated solely within the fuels unit. All requirements for process steam and preheating purposes are met with saturated steam produced within the unit. This eliminates the requirement for external steam superheaters, thereby reducing demand for carbon-based fuels.

The process also includes the option to recycle carbon-containing streams, such as light-end and naphtha fractions from the upgrading section. Naphtha can be reprocessed in the SynCOR™ unit, boosting syngas production for SAF. Naphtha pre-reforming and reforming are well-established steps for several decades, making them an excellent choice for maximizing SAF output.

It includes production tax credits meant to incentivize the deployment of low-carbon hydrogen.

“But I believe green hydrogen has a strong future and is going to be big. India will play an instrumental role in this transition, alongside many other countries devoted to this,” he added.

The MNRE Secretary said India is in discussions with Europe, specifically the ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp, to ensure that green hydrogen and its derivatives exported to these countries are transported smoothly. Reduction of import duties on India’s green hydrogen exports is also a part of ongoing free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations with Europe, he said.

Sluggish offtake slows expansion of green hydrogen sector

ReNew, a major renewables player in India, is developing a green ammonia project in Odisha. However, weak export demand remains a major hurdle for offtake.

“At this point, export markets are very weak, with little movement globally. That said, there is some progress on the shipping front, with the International Maritime Organization urging shipping companies to start using some degree of clean fuels, about 5 per cent. Sustainable aviation fuel may also take off soon. So there is hope for the future — but for now, progress remains slow,” its chief executive officer Sumant Sinha told The Indian Express.

On demand from the EU, Sinha said, “The issue is that the EU and its companies aren’t floating major tenders. The lone Hintco tender failed due to poor design from a developer’s perspective, drawing almost no bids. Since then, nothing significant has emerged, and with ongoing geopolitical stuff, attention has shifted elsewhere.”

Hintco is the implementing agency of the Hamburg-headquartered H2Global Foundation, which was set up to support the large-scale ramp-up and industrial use of clean hydrogen and other low-emissions fuels.

Building domestic demand in focus

With export demand still weak, the government is focused on building domestic demand. “We’ve seen strong interest in green hydrogen — our tender for around 8 lakh tonnes was fully bid out. Similarly, for offtake arrangements, we’re working with the Ministry of Fertilizers and the fertilizer industry. SECI (Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd) is currently conducting a tender for about 7 lakh tonnes to support this,” Sarangi said.

“As far as the Government of India is concerned, several measures are underway to ensure offtake. Pilot projects are also being implemented across sectors like transportation, shipping, and steel. We’re currently funding hydrogen fuel cell buses in five locations, including Ladakh, to test their viability in real-world conditions,” he added.

Sinha argued that domestic mandates may be necessary to replace grey hydrogen — produced from fossil fuels — with green hydrogen. For instance, the fertiliser industry could be required to source more green ammonia from domestic producers.

Green hydrogen, produced by powering electrolysers with renewable energy, is a key feedstock for green ammonia, made by combining hydrogen with nitrogen. Green ammonia has applications as a low-carbon fertiliser and as a fuel for shipping.

Green hydrogen not yet cost competitive

“Commercially, it’s not viable yet because green hydrogen is still more expensive than grey hydrogen. So, no one is going to buy it voluntarily. It’s similar to where renewable energy was 15 years ago — back then, it wasn’t commercially viable either. Today, it is. Green hydrogen is at that early stage now,” Sinha said.

A new report by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Bain & Company, and RMI released on Thursday said, “The slowed momentum primarily stems from the current high production costs along with nascent enabling infrastructure and high financing costs. Current production costs — $4-$5 per kg of green hydrogen vs. $2.3-$2.5 per kg of grey hydrogen typically (some industries may procure at higher costs) — are not yet competitive.”

In 2023, the Central government launched the National Green Hydrogen Mission, setting a target of 5 million metric tonnes (MMT) of green hydrogen production capacity by 2030, backed by an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore. Under the mission, the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) programme aims to support both green hydrogen production and electrolyser manufacturing.

In April, MNRE also launched a scheme to measure, monitor, report, verify on-site, and certify green hydrogen based on a standard introduced by the ministry in 2023.

The CII report outlines five immediate demand-side strategies to accelerate green hydrogen adoption. It recommends blending small amounts of green hydrogen into existing grey hydrogen or piped natural gas supplies for high-volume sectors such as refineries, fertilisers, and city gas networks, while factoring in technical feasibility. It suggests encouraging substitution in niche industries such as glass, ceramics, and chemicals where switching is cost-neutral. Public procurement, especially for green steel, can also help scale domestic demand.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/06/Santosh-Kumar-Sarangi-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 11:06:09.572554

Speaking at the 35th Annual Congress & General Assembly of ACI Europe in Athens, Tzitzikostas highlighted that despite Europe’s leadership in air traffic management innovation, current airspace capacity is insufficient to meet demand, especially during peak travel seasons. This congestion has resulted in overcrowded airports, delayed flights, and frustrated travelers.

“Europe is a world leader in innovation in air traffic management, but we need another push to make European skies more flexible and less fragmented,” he said.

The Commissioner emphasized the potential of SESAR (Single European Sky ATM Research) innovations to improve efficiency and urged immediate investment in new technologies and recruitment of additional staff to enhance airspace management and reduce delays.

Sustainability: A central pillar for Europe’s airports

During his speech, Tzitzikostas applauded airports’ proactive role in carbon management, notably through initiatives like the Airport Carbon Accreditation programme. He highlighted how airports are evolving into clean energy hubs by integrating green electricity systems, hydrogen, and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), positioning themselves as testbeds for the circular economy and new market opportunities.

He described reducing carbon emissions as critical not only for environmental reasons but also as a driver of economic growth, energy independence, and social progress. The European Union will continue supporting this transition through incentives and policies to accelerate renewable fuels, greener infrastructure, and clean technologies in both aircraft and airport operations.

Looking ahead, Tzitzikostas said the EU’s upcoming Sustainable Transport Investment Plan aims to bolster support for renewable aviation fuels and green technologies. He underscored the importance of rewarding “courage and risk-taking” to turn the “first mover disadvantage” into a competitive edge for airports embracing sustainability.

Enhancing competitiveness and resilience

Referring to competitiveness, Tzitzikostas said it remains a key priority. The Commissioner noted ongoing revisions to air service regulations intended to strengthen Europe’s international aviation competitiveness, reduce bureaucratic hurdles, and enhance passenger rights. A comprehensive legislative proposal is expected by mid-2026.

He also highlighted the importance of improving sector resilience and crisis management. Acknowledging the challenges posed by climate change and security threats, Tzitzikostas called for climate risk assessments in airport infrastructure planning and construction. He praised ACI members for leveraging technology to improve passenger experience and safety, pledging continued EU support for innovation and collaboration.

The vital role of airports in Europe’s connectivity

Reaffirming the crucial role of airports, the Commissioner stressed their importance in connecting European communities and economies. He highlighted the need for ongoing cooperation among stakeholders to maintain Europe’s leadership in innovation, sustainability, and operational excellence.

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is facing mounting backlash after announcing plans to phase out the Energy Star programme, a 30-year-old initiative widely praised for advancing energy efficiency.

First launched in 1992, Energy Star labels have helped consumers identify high-efficiency products and buildings, playing a crucial role in reducing emissions and energy costs.

Critics, including 22 US senators, argue the EPA’s move may breach federal law, which mandates joint oversight of the programme with the Department of Energy under the Energy Policy Act of 2005.

Environmental advocates warn that ending Energy Star would undermine climate goals, particularly as EVs increase demand on the grid and require efficient surrounding infrastructure.

Given the intricacies of the refining process and the natural variation in raw materials, it is challenging to define an exact chemical composition for fuels. As a result, the Classification, Labelling, and Packaging (CLP) Regulation gives some flexibility when notifying fuels, compared to other mixtures.

Why are fuels reported differently?

Unlike more straightforward chemical formulations, fuels are derived from crude oil, which undergoes refining processes that can lead to variations in composition. This makes it difficult to provide a definitive list of ingredients in the way that is typically required for a standard PCN submission.

Recognising this complexity, the CLP Regulation allows the composition from the fuel’s Safety Data Sheet (SDS) to be used instead of the full composition. Additionally, the identity and concentration of any other known components shall also be included in the submission.

Key considerations for fuels in PCNs

Scope of PCN requirements: fuels fall under the remit of PCN obligations meaning companies dealing with these substances must submit notifications in compliance with CLP Regulation Annex VIII requirements.

UFI and reporting challenges: each submitted fuel must have an associated Unique Formula Identifier (UFI) so that in a poisoning emergency, health care professionals and emergency responders can ensure an accurate match between the fuel and its composition.

List of fuels: The following table outlines the fuels that benefit from the regulatory flexibility provided by the CLP Regulation. Products can only notify as a “fuel” if included on this list, otherwise products would be treated as a standard mixture under CLP, meaning we need full composition.

Please note that this list is exhaustive according to the CLP guidelines, available here:

Fuel name Product description Gasoline EN228 Automotive fuels - Unleaded petrol Gasoline E85 Automotive fuels – Ethanol (E85) automotive fuel Gasoline alkylate Motor fuels – special petrol for powered implements LPG Liquefied Petroleum Gas used as fuel LNG Liquefied Natural Gas used as fuel Diesel fuel Automotive fuels – diesel engine fuels with/without biofuel Paraffinic diesel fuels (e.g GTL, BTL or HVO) Automotive fuels – Paraffinic diesel fuel from synthesis or hydrotreatment Heating oil Liquid mineral fuels with the characteristics of domestic fuel oil MK 1 diesel Automotive fuels – Diesel fuel oil of environmental class 1 and 2 for high-speed diesel engines Aviation fuels Aviation turbine engine and piston engine fuels Kerosene – Illuminating paraffin Illuminating paraffin lampoil Type B and C Heavy fuel oil All grades of heavy fuel oil Marine fuel Marine fuels, containing or not biodiesel Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) – Diesel B100 Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) for use in diesel engines and heating applications

Sustainability support

Beyond Poison Centre compliance, fuel producers are increasingly affected by EU-wide sustainability regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting the use of renewable energy in transport. Key pieces of legislation – including RED II, RefuelEU Aviation, and FuelEU Maritime – play a central role in shaping the future of fuel production and use. These frameworks introduce new targets and sustainability criteria that fuel manufacturers must consider as part of their operational and strategic planning:

REDII (Renewable Energy Directive II):

Establishes a fossil fuel baseline of 94gCO2eq per MJ.

Requires a 70% reduction in emissions for Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBOs).

Refuel EU Aviation (Aviation Fuels):

Mandates a gradual increase in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blending into conventional aviation fuel (2% by 2025, 6% by 2030, 70% by 2050).

SAF must achieve at least a 65% reduction in emissions to qualify.

FuelEU Marine (Marine Fuels):

Sets Greenhouse Gas (GHG) intensity limits for marine fuels' well-to-wake emissions (34.6gCO2eq per MJ by 2045 and 18.2gCO2eq per MJ by 2050).

Introduces a specific calculation methodology to assess emissions.

The initiative delivers an integrated, end-to-end solution that converts biomass and municipal solid waste into SAF by bringing together a full range of technologies under one delivery model.

It combines GIDARA Energy’s gasification systems, Johnson Matthey’s catalyst expertise, Honeywell’s automation and process controls, and SAMSUNG E&A’s global engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) capabilities.

At the core of the solution is the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process, a well-established method for producing liquid hydrocarbons from synthesis gas.

The companies say this approach not only simplifies project development but also reduces risk, offering one point of accountability from initial feasibility to full-scale execution. According to the alliance, the model can shorten lead times by more than 15% and reduce capital expenditure by up to 10%.

Aviation’s pressure to scale up

The initiative comes at a time when aviation is under growing pressure to scale up sustainable fuel use, but faces limited access to traditional feedstocks such as used cooking oil or animal fats.

By enabling SAF production from household and industrial waste streams, the alliance aims to unlock new supply chains for the sector.

Ken West, President and CEO of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, said, “As demand for SAF increases, the technology to expand available feedstock options becomes increasingly vital. This comprehensive alliance provides refiners with a strategic approach to quickly execute their vision.”

Clearing the path to SAF growth

The International Energy Agency predicts that waste- and residue-based sources will account for more than 40% of total biofuel demand by 2030, reinforcing the urgency of technology solutions that can tap into these resources.

“The alliance targets the common challenges faced by SAF producers and offers a new way forward with greater speed and lower capital expense cost,” said Maurits van Tol, CEO of Catalyst Technologies, Johnson Matthey.

The global SAF market was valued at $658.18 million in 2023, and will be worth $15.85 billion by the end of the decade, the report claims, driven by increasing environmental awareness, strong regulatory backing, and growing demand across both the commercial and military aviation sectors.

SAF adoption

International climate targets, such as the Paris Agreement and ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) initiative, have put pressure on the aviation sector to decarbonise, and adoption of SAF is ‘speeding up’ thanks to government mandates and incentives such as tax credits. This, in turn is leading to increased interest from the corporate sector.

‘The increasing investor attention on eco-friendly aviation technologies together with rising R&D funding creates innovative business structures and collaborative partnerships,’ the report notes. ‘SAF emerges as a crucial element for sustainable aviation because the public’s increased environmental consciousness and eco-conscious travel trends strengthen the need for cleaner aviation solutions.’

Emissions reduction

Currently, the aviation sector is responsible for between 2% and 3% of global CO2 emissions. As well as government action to address this, a number of airlines, including Delta, Lufthansa, British Airways, and United Airlines, are responding by committing to net-zero goals by 2050 and entering long-term procurement agreements for SAF.

‘These companies are forging extended offtake agreements with SAF producers while simultaneously co-investing in production facilities and investigating partnerships with technology firms to ensure a continuous supply of low-carbon fuels,’ the report notes.

Airline manufacturers, too, are doing their part, with commitments to certify commercial aircraft for full SAF operation by 2030.

‘Airlines with strong environmental credentials are becoming preferred choices for corporate travellers and logistics providers, which pushes carriers to adopt SAF in their operations,’ the report states. ‘Industry-led initiatives demonstrate the increasing agreement that SAF adoption serves as both an environmental necessity and a competitive edge.’

The SAF market is divided into several sectors, including biofuel, hydrogen fuel, power to liquid fuel, and gas-to-liquid. Biofuels currently dominate, accounting for over 76% of the market.

The aviation sector urgently requires large volumes of drop-in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to meet decarbonization targets. Advanced biofuels derived from lignocellulosic residues, particularly via syngas-to Fischer-Tropsch Biomass-to-Liquid (BtL) processes, are among the most promising options. However, conventional BtL remains cost-intensive, and its economic viability is uncertain. Electrification of BtL through the integration of electrolytic hydrogen, co-electrolysis, or plasma-assisted gasification has been proposed as a means to boost carbon efficiency and product yield. This study investigates whether such electrification strategies can be economically viable. A detailed techno-economic assessment (TEA) is conducted for the conventional BtL process and eight electrified alternatives. The TEA is based on thermodynamic process models implemented in Aspen ­Plus and the different process configurations are compared in terms of capital investment and levelized cost of SAF production. The results reveal a trade-off between carbon efficiency and production cost. Under baseline assumptions, electrification increases both capital investment and production cost. Sensitivity analyses identify electricity and biomass prices, SOEL stack costs, and plant operating hours as key cost drivers. Under favorable assumptions, certain configurations offer improved capital efficiency and competitive production costs at the same time. Several electrified configurations achieve LCOPs below 1.5 €/l suggesting that while electrification does not universally reduce costs, it can enable economically viable SAF production under the right conditions particularly when high product yields and carbon efficiency are prioritized.",https://cdn.ssrn.com/ssrn-global-header/11589acb53bc518aa22929bf19add113.svg,N,,2025-06-20 04:00:05.828531

“And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion (€3.8 billion) globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

Most SAF is now heading toward Europe, where the EU and UK mandates kicked in on 1 January 2025.

Unacceptably, the cost of SAF to airlines has now doubled in Europe because of compliance fees that SAF producers or suppliers are charging.

For the expected one million tonnes of SAF that will be purchased to meet the European mandates in 2025, the expected cost at current market prices is $1.2 billion (€1.04 billion).

Compliance fees are estimated to add an additional $1.7 billion (€1.47 billion) on top of market prices — an amount that could have abated an additional 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions.

Instead of promoting the use of SAF, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel.

“This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonisation. Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7 trillion (€4.07 trillion) should not be the aim or the result of decarbonisation policies.

TotalEnergies is working towards the decarbonization of air transportation, with the production and distribution to its customers of sustainable aviation fuel . As from 2028, the Company will be able to produce more than half a million tons of SAF a year to cover the increase in the European SAF blending mandate, set at 6% for 2030.

TotalEnergies will be able to supply SAF more than 10% of the jet fuel volumes it will market in Europe, ahead of the European mandate set at 6% in 2030.

“TotalEnergies is taking action to meet the strong demand from the aviation industry to reduce its carbon footprint. Sustainable aviation fuels are essential to bring the air industry’s CO2 emissions down immediately. Their development is fully aligned with our approach to get to net zero, together with society,” said Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TotalEnergies. “For ten years, we have been pioneering and investing in biorefineries and developing coprocessing in our refineries.”

TotalEnergies, pioneering SAF production

The Grandpuits biorefinery: Thanks to a €500 million investment, TotalEnergies transforms its site into a zero-crude platform, including a biorefinery with a production capacity of 230,000 tons a year of SAF in 2026. TotalEnergies has joined force with SARIA, the European leader in the collection and recovery of organic materials, which will supply the majority of the feedstock supply.

The La Mède biorefinery: This year, La Mède will produce 15,000 tons of SAF for distribution to airports in the south of France.

The Normandy refinery: TotalEnergies has begun coprocessing SAF at its Normandy platform. Coprocessing involves the treatment of both fossil jet fuel and biomass in a standard refining unit. The site’s annual production capacity is 160,000 tons.

The Antwerp refinery in Belgium: An initial project to coprocess 50,000 tons a year of SAF was launched this year. Annual production capacity will subsequently be increased to 80,000 tons a year.

The Leuna refinery in Germany: A coprocessing project for 50,000 tons a year is planned for 2026.

TotalEnergies, supplying SAF to customers in the air industry

TotalEnergies supplies aviation fuels including SAF, in line with blending mandates and the needs of its customers. Those customers include several airlines:

Air France-KLM, with whom the Company has signed a major deal to deliver up to 1.5 million tons of SAF over ten years. This is one of the Group’s largest SAF supply contracts.

Volotea, which has also signed to buy SAF from TotalEnergies until 2029, in order to reduce the emissions of its flights out of several French airports.

TotalEnergies also supplies SAF-blended aviation fuel to several French airports, including Bordeaux, Toulouse, Paris-Le Bourget, Clermont-Ferrand and Saint-Nazaire.

TotalEnergies, a partner committed to SAF research

TotalEnergies is also forging partnerships with aerospace groups to accelerate the sector’s decarbonization. Those partnerships are playing a critical role in understanding the impact of sustainable aviation fuel composition on aircraft, especially for blends of over 50%. They include:

A partnership with Airbus, signed in 2024, to supply over half the company’s needs in Europe, and conduct a shared R&D program to develop fully sustainable fuels.

A partnership with Safran, begun in 2021, that led to the formulation of a SAF that was completely compatible with current aircraft and was used to power a flight by a military helicopter in February 2023.

TotalEnergies is also stepping up its R&D effort, especially in feedstock, which remains one of the challenges to increasing SAF production. The Solaize research center in Lyon has specialist teams coordinating this work.

Catch crops are crops sown between two main crops on the same plot. As such, they do not require additional land and do not compete with human and animal food, while still providing additional income for farmers. They are eligible under European regulations for the production of SAF.

These crops also enable the co-production of plant proteins, thus contributing to the protein sovereignty of France and Europe in animal feed. They also offer numerous agronomic benefits: in particular, they limit soil erosion, improve soil structure, reduce water loss, and contribute to the preservation of biodiversity.

Vegetable oils eligible for transformation into sustainable aviation fuels

As part of this agreement, TotalEnergies and Avril will therefore evaluate the entire value chain, from the selection of plant varieties to the production of biofuels, with the aim of structuring a sustainable French sector.

Avril will supply vegetable oils from intermediate crops to TotalEnergies, which will transform them into sustainable aviation fuel in its French biorefineries and through coprocessing in its French and European refineries.

Bioethanol in the UK is mostly used as a fuel blend in petrol to help reduce emissions.
Both Ensus and Vivergo also produce high protein animal feed as a byproduct which is sold back to farmers.
Ensus UK chairman Grant Pearson, meanwhile, said the “government urgently needs to find a solution to a crisis of its own making”.","Vivergo

A SECOND UK bioethanol plant has said this week it faces “imminent closure” following the US-UK trade deal agreed last month.

Teesside-based Ensus announced on Monday that it may be forced to close without government support for the UK bioethanol sector, which risks being undercut by US imports following the removal of 19% tariffs under the US-UK deal.

Ensus’ announcement follows weeks of warnings from bioethanol manufacturer Vivergo, based in Hull, which said it will close if it receives no commitment of support from the government by 25 June. Ensus has not confirmed a specific date for closure.

Ensus and Vivergo – the UK’s only two major bioethanol plants – produce ethanol from wheat feedstock, mostly sourced from British farms. Vivergo has suspended its purchases of this feedstock until it receives clarity from the government. Combined, the two plants produce 820m L of bioethanol each year, far short of the 1.4bn L quota US producers will have tariff-free access to supply. US ethanol producers, who are already heavily subsidised, produce the chemical using waste from corn farming.

Bioethanol in the UK is mostly used as a fuel blend in petrol to help reduce emissions. Ensus, owned by the German conglomerate Südzucker, the world’s largest sugar manufacturer, is working with Vivergo to urge the government to increase UK demand for bioethanol above 1.4bn L. Vivergo believes the best way to do this is to increase the proportion of bioethanol in standard grade petrol from 10% to 15%, which would also reduce emissions from cars.

As a byproduct of the process, Ensus makes high purity commercial CO2 used in beverages and as a preservative in packaged food. Their CO2 is also used in hospital operating theatres and as a coolant in nuclear reactors. Both Ensus and Vivergo also produce high protein animal feed as a byproduct which is sold back to farmers.

The ethanol component of the trade deal, which was primarily intended to support the UK car and steel industries, was described by the CEO of ABF Sugar, Vivergo’s parent company, as a “last-minute concession” in the negotiations. Ensus UK chairman Grant Pearson, meanwhile, said the “government urgently needs to find a solution to a crisis of its own making”.

Pearson added: “We need a solution which will not only save these skilled jobs on Teesside but also prevent a catastrophic knock-on effect in other vital sectors of the economy.

“The closure of Ensus – a profitable, growth-generating business, would be a disaster for the UK’s ability to develop a green industrial base as we are part of the solution to decarbonising the UK’s chemical industry and producing important products for the future such as sustainable aviation fuel.”

Ensus and Vivergo employ over 260 people, while supporting thousands more indirectly in agriculture, transport and chemical storage. Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen said: “The chemical sector is the backbone of countless industries and this trade deal, as it stands, has the potential to cripple it. That’s simply unacceptable – we urgently need clarity and intervention now.”

Vivergo has been in discussions with business secretary Jonathan Reynolds and transport secretary Heidi Alexander on the implications of the trade deal for bioethanol. After president Donald Trump signed off on the part of the deal to reduce tariffs on British cars on Monday, Reynolds said he planned to “update parliament” regarding bioethanol.",https://www.thechemicalengineer.com/media/12456/vivergo-fuels-yorkshire.jpg?width=960,N,,2025-06-20 08:04:45.953316

But with their tight margins and rapid expansion, these carriers now face mounting pressures, from rising fuel costs to fierce competition and shifting regulations.

This article explores the top five financial, economic, and management challenges threatening LCCs, and the strategies they can use to future-proof their business models.

1. Volatile Fuel Prices & Sustainability Costs

Jet fuel is consistently one of the largest operational expenses for airlines, and its price volatility continues to threaten profit margins. Adding to this challenge are rising sustainability requirements. The UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate now requires that SAF make up an average of 2% of aviation fuel used on departing flights in 2025, with that percentage set to rise in future years. While aimed at decarbonising aviation, the policy has already drawn criticism from IATA for imposing significant cost burdens on airlines.

Overcoming Strategy: Airlines should adopt hedging strategies to mitigate fuel price fluctuations, invest in next-gen fuel-efficient aircraft, and support efforts to scale affordable SAF, such as those backed by the UK’sSustainable Aviation Fuel Bill 2024–25.

2. Intense Competition & Yield Pressure

LCCs are in fierce competition for market share, not just with each other, but also with legacy carriersadapting their models. With aggressive fleet growth (Ryanair, easyJet, and Wizz Air expanding rapidly), ticket prices are staying low even as costs rise. According to IATA, passenger yields are expected to decline by 4.0% in 2025.

Overcoming Strategy: To maintain profit margins, LCCs must diversify their ancillary revenues such as baggage fees, seat selection, and onboard sales. They must also optimise loyalty programmes and implement cost-efficiency strategies to control rising costs.

3. Operational Inefficiencies & Supply Chain Disruptions

Operational inefficiencies such as air traffic control delays, airport capacity limits, and supply chain setbacks are taking a toll on the industry. These directly impact overall efficiencies through increasing turnaround times, reducing aircraft utilisation, and inflating costs.

Overcoming Strategy: Leveraging data analytics for predictive maintenance and smarter route optimisation can reduce delays and operating costs. At the same time, diversifying suppliers helps build more resilient supply chains.

4. Labour Shortages & Rising Staff Costs

Post-pandemic recovery has brought an industry-wide shortage of skilled aviation professionals, especially for pilots, cabin crew, and engineers. As demand returns, wages are rising, challenging the low cost model LCCs depend on.

Overcoming Strategy: Retaining talent in a competitive market requires offering better working conditions, embracing automation, and investing in comprehensive workforce development. Many airlines are partnering with academic institutions to equip staff with the skills needed for a tech-driven aviation future, while also strengthening employee relations through ongoing development and engagement.

5. Macroeconomic Headwinds & Regulatory Compliance

Low-cost carriers are increasingly vulnerable to external economic forces. In May 2025, rising airfares were a key contributor to UK inflation, while the latest hike in Air Passenger Duty has further impacted margins and challenged price-sensitive demand.",https://ukaviation.news/wp-content/uploads/AdobeStock_1188917580.jpeg,N,,2025-06-19 23:59:50.655018

There were some positives and negatives for Canada’s canola industry, said the executive director of the Canadian Oilseed Processors Association.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released its proposed rule for the Renewable Fuel Standard renewable volume obligations (RVOs).

VIDEO: New Assiniboine College program sows digital farm skills

The new digital agriculture fundamentals program has kicked off at Assiniboine College in Brandon.

The biomass-based diesel mandate, which includes biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, was set at 5.61 billion gallons for 2026 and 5.86 billion gallons for 2027.

That is a massive increase from the 3.35 billion gallon mandate for 2025 and is even higher than the 5.25 billion gallons that a coalition of oil and biofuel groups had been lobbying for.

That is good news for Canada’s crushers and canola farmers.

The bad news is that the EPA also proposed that foreign biofuels and feedstocks would only generate 50 per cent of the Renewable Identification Numbers (RIN) credit value relative to U.S. biofuels and feedstocks.

“That’s unfortunate,” said Vervaet.

“They’re proposing a 50 per cent haircut, if you will.”

The American Soybean Association was thrilled with the “new concept.”

“As soybean farmers struggle to maintain biofuel feedstock market share amid the rapidly growing flood of cheap, foreign feedstocks like used cooking oil, this proposal would once again give U.S. agriculture a competitive edge in the biofuel value chain,” the association said in a press release.

Vervaet is puzzled that the EPA chose to penalize Canadian canola-based biofuels since elsewhere in the proposed rule it praised canola oil as a predictable and plentiful feedstock.

He said that new proposal could seriously restrict the flow of Canadian canola oil to the U.S. market.

“With that type of a haircut on credit values, we’re going to be challenged to compete with other feedstocks. There’s no doubt about it,” he said.

However, he is hopeful that the EPA will come to its senses in time for the final rule, which is expected later this year.

“We have to remember this is a proposed rule. There is still time to influence some of the final content in this rule,” he said.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate Finance Committee released its draft of the One Big Beautiful Bill, which includes an extension of the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit.

Vervaet said there were some pluses and minuses with that legislative proposal as well.

He was pleased to see that the credit, which pays up to US$1 per gallon for biodiesel and renewable diesel and $1.75 per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel, would be extended through the end of 2031, just like the House version of the bill.

More importantly, both the Senate and House reconciliation bills exclude indirect land use change (ILUC) from being used to calculate lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. That means canola-based fuels would be eligible for the credit.

However, the Senate version of the bill differs from the House version in one crucial area.

The House version limits the availability of the 45Z credit to fuels produced from feedstocks grown in the U.S., Mexico or Canada.

The Senate version says the feedstock can be produced anywhere, but the credit would be reduced by 20 per cent for fuel produced from feedstocks grown outside the U.S. effective Jan. 1, 2026.

Vervaet said the Senate version penalizes Canadian canola oil, while the House version creates a “ringfence” for North American feedstock, which he thinks makes sense.

“Our markets are so integrated already, where you have millions of dollars of feedstock and finished fuels crisscrossing our border,” he said.

He is hopeful that the House will prevail in that aspect of the ongoing budget bill battle.

Ian Thomson, past president of Advanced Biofuels Canada, said the glass is definitely half empty when it comes to how Canada’s biofuel producers view the new U.S. policy proposals.

“We’re worse off than we were before,” he said.

The biomass-based diesel industry was “delighted” with the EPA’s new mandates for 2026 and 2027.

But Canadian biofuels would not be competitive in the U.S. market if they can’t get the same RIN values and tax credits as American biofuels.

Thomson is pleased with the removal of the ILUC factor in calculating greenhouse gas emissions, but it is a hollow victory because soybean oil renewable diesel would receive a $0.53 per gallon credit under the new rules, while canola oil renewable diesel would get a $0.22 credit.

“You’re still way under water versus the U.S.,” he said.

Thomson said U.S. biofuel policy is shifting to a made-in-the-U.S. approach, rather than the open border concept that existed for years.

Canada may have to follow their lead and promote made-in-Canada biofuels, he said.

Ottawa is aware of the problem and is well briefed on what needs to happen to keep Canada’s biofuel sector whole.

“They understand there is urgency,” said Thomson.

“This is not something that can grind through iterations of how Canada will respond.”

British Columbia recently made changes to its Low Carbon Fuels Act, doubling the renewable fuel mandate for diesel to eight per cent and requiring that the renewable content must be produced in Canada.

“Could Canada do likewise?” said Thomson.

“It could.”",https://static.producer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/19143143/144836_web1_RHB_Canola-in-bloom.jpg,N,,2025-06-19 19:03:37.795043

This strategic move reinforces ATR’s commitment to decarbonizing air transport and seeks to provide concrete solutions for airlines that currently lack direct access to this type of fuel.

Practical Solutions for Efficient SAF Access

The collaboration focuses on three key areas:

1. Simplified Physical Delivery

The companies will explore logistical models to enable regional airlines to access SAF without operational complications, facilitating distribution even in remote areas.

2. Technical and Regulatory Support

Assistance will be provided to help airlines integrate SAF into their current operations, ensuring compliance with existing regulations and uninterrupted services.

3. Mass Balance Model

This approach, aligned with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, allows operators to benefit from the environmental advantages of SAF even if they do not use it physically, easing the transition toward more sustainable operations.

→ ATR and Pratt & Whitney Canada Join Forces to Develop Next-Generation Regional Turboprops

Nathalie Tarnaud Laude, CEO of ATR, emphasized that “sustainable fuel is one of the most effective tools for reducing emissions in the short to medium term.” She acknowledged that many regional airlines face challenges in accessing SAF, particularly in less-connected areas, and stressed that this partnership with ATOBA ENERGY aims to eliminate those barriers: “We are not only promoting SAF but also working to make it a viable and scalable solution for our entire global network.”

Arnaud Namer, CEO of ATOBA ENERGY, highlighted the inclusive nature of the initiative: “We are proud to partner with ATR to make sustainable aviation an accessible reality. Our ‘Book and Claim’ and mass balance model is key to enabling any operator, regardless of location, to reduce its carbon footprint.”

Securing this extension would not only allow SAF producers to attract and sustain the financing needed to scale the next generation of aviation fuel.","Dan Kietzer is a farmer from Mediapolis, Iowa, and is the director of Iowa Corn Growers Association District 9.

Being a farmer in Iowa is no easy feat, and the last few years have presented new challenges, making it harder to get by. The value of Iowa farms was down 3.1% last year due to lower crop prices, increased interest rates, and high labor and supply costs.

If we don’t change course, this will have community-wide effects on the entire ag economy—in Iowa and across the country. Thankfully, supportive federal policy for sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, production could provide farmers like me new opportunities to stay in the game.

The 45Z production tax credit is critical to putting American energy production and farmers first. It will help SAF producers establish new markets for farmers to sell their sustainably produced crops, rewarding farmers for their investments in regenerative agriculture. For example, when farmers sell their crops as feedstocks to SAF producers, they can expect to earn up to an additional 20 cents per bushel of sustainably grown corn.

Many farmers, including myself, have adopted cutting-edge practices and technologies that allow us to efficiently and sustainably produce more crops per acre while also growing our bottom line. The market incentive to adopt these practices is clear and compelling: beyond the sizable market demand for sequestering carbon, these practices save us valuable time and money relative to more traditional methods.

Big Beautiful Bill could aid Iowa stewardship, but we still need a farm bill | Opinion

By leveraging practices like low- or no-till farming systems, improved fertilizer management, and conservation crop rotation, farmers can improve crop and soil health while increasing efficiencies and profitability. This means that even amidst volatile growing conditions, farms are prepared to withstand shock and remain economically viable.

The U.S. House of Representatives, thanks to the leadership of the Iowa delegation, included a provision in its budget bill to extend the 45Z credit through 2031. This is critical to putting America first and securing new opportunities for Iowa farmers. Farmers across the country applaud the House for its support of this credit and urge the Senate to ensure this provision becomes law. Securing this extension would not only allow SAF producers to attract and sustain the financing needed to scale the next generation of aviation fuel. It would also ensure this nascent industry can thrive and support American energy security.

These practices are the future of farming — providing farmers with an economic and environmental edge. In 2023 alone, Iowan farmers earned more than $9.5 billion by selling corn as feedstock to biofuel producers.

American farmers are ready to deliver wins for America and strengthen our domestic energy security, but we need these markets for biofuels like SAF to grow and thrive. These fuels are ready to be used today in existing aircraft and airport fueling infrastructure, simplifying adoption. By helping to launch this nascent industry, policymakers can give American biofuel producers and aviation the competitive edge needed to win on a global stage.

As a third-generation farmer in Iowa, it's essential to find new demand, like SAF, for our corn. Thanks to technological advances and sound farming practices, we continue to raise more corn on fewer acres of land with fewer fertilizer inputs. My son, a fourth-generation farmer on this land, is now farming with me, and it is paramount that we find new markets to use the higher production that we are realizing. Without new markets like SAF, it will be difficult to sustain the next generation in our operation.

We are on the cusp of an energy revolution driven by Iowa farmers and biofuel producers. As Congress acts on required tax legislation this year, it is critical it implements and extends the 45Z credit in that package. Reps. Randy Feenstra, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Ashley Hinson, and Zach Nunn have done their due diligence on the 45Z extension. With continued support from Sen. Joni Ernst and Sen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa can remain an energy leader while creating new opportunities for our farmers and bolstering our local communities.

The company has agreed to purchase 7,500 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which will be used at Amazon Air cargo operations in California.

It’s part of Amazon’s wider climate plan to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2040, but the move is also about strengthening the supply chain needed to deliver that target.

Securing fuel supply for lower carbon air freight

Neste, one of the main producers of renewable fuel globally, will deliver the SAF to two key West Coast airports: San Francisco International Airport (SFO) and Ontario International Airport (ONT), with Amazon becoming the first company to use SAF at ONT.

The deliveries build on a partnership first launched four years ago, when Neste supplied SAF to Amazon at Germany’s Cologne Bonn Airport.

Neste’s SAF is made from renewable waste materials and can cut greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by up to 80% over its lifecycle when used in its purest form. When blended with conventional jet fuel - as Amazon plans to do - it still reduces emissions by up to 50%.

This mix of renewable and traditional fuels reflects how most SAF is currently used in aviation due to infrastructure and engine certification limits.

Neste’s supply into California leans heavily on local logistics. SAF is pumped directly to aircraft at SFO through existing pipelines.

At ONT, it’s delivered by Diesel Direct trucks running on renewable diesel. This layered supply approach offers both flexibility and reliability, which is vital as demand for SAF grows.

Carl Nyberg, Senior Vice President of Commercial Renewable Products at Neste, says the agreement with Amazon is not just about volume but visibility: “We are excited to provide SAF to Amazon Air at two major airports in California.

""This milestone sends a positive signal that SAF is available to airlines and cargo operators, like Amazon Air at these airports.”

Building a practical green fuel network

Neste’s current production capacity stands at 1.5 million tonnes annually, with plans to expand that to 2.2 million tonnes by 2027. However, SAF still makes up only a small slice of the global aviation fuel market.

Scaling up will depend on partnerships like this one and investments in infrastructure that allow the fuel to flow efficiently.

The logistics behind SAF delivery are complex and not always visible to consumers. At SFO, the airport developed the country’s first dedicated SAF pipeline system back in 2020.

That setup allows SAF to be mixed, stored and moved into aircraft using existing facilities, avoiding the need for carbon-heavy ground transport.

The airport also formed the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Stakeholders Working Group in 2018, uniting fuel suppliers, airlines and regulators to coordinate the rollout of SAF.

ONT doesn’t have the same infrastructure yet, but hosting its first SAF deployment could be the first step.

With Amazon and Neste showing that the fuel can be delivered and used there, the airport is now positioned to attract further investment in sustainable aviation systems.

That could be critical for smaller airports trying to remain relevant in a low-carbon future.

Carl points to the broader benefits: “Our supply chain solution for these California gateways builds on our existing SAF supply capabilities on the West Coast in the US and leverages our partnership with Diesel Direct to transport SAF by trucks running on renewable diesel.”

Approximately $80 trillion of wealth is expected to be inherited over the next two decades, presenting a substantial opportunity for private aviation.
Gallagher said that while the industry is often labeled as a luxury, there are very different reasons customers fly privately.

Praise For Pilots Gallagher also praised the company’s pilots, calling them “the best ambassadors we have for our brand, along with our flight attendants.” Gallagher noted that pilots are the largest group of NetJets’ employees.","In a wide-ranging interview with CNBC this morning, NetJets Aviation President Patrick Gallagher gave a bullish forecast for both the world’s largest private jet operator and the industry as a whole.

NetJets, he told CNBC’s Robert Frank, expects to take delivery of around 90 new private jets this year, “virtually all of which are already fully sold to customers.”

Asked if anything is clouding his outlook, Gallagher said, “In terms of what we see in future demand, there have really been no signs of slowdown even in this period of market volatility, uncertainty, and tariff concerns.”

Gallagher continued:

‘We watch all the leading indicators very closely. How much are our existing customers flying? Are they giving us less notice? Are they still booking with normal travel patterns? Are they going to different places? Is travel to Europe down compared to last year? So far, we have not seen any indicators of our business at NetJets slowing down.’

However, Gallagher did add, “The sales cycle has got a little longer. It’s taking people a little longer to make a decision, but our sales volumes haven’t suffered at all.”

Room To Grow

Gallagher also discussed the opportunity to grow the addressable market.

He pointed to a McKinsey survey that estimated that before the pandemic, only about 10% of the population that had the financial means to fly privately were doing so.

Gallagher told CNBC, “The pandemic unlocked a portion, but if the private aviation market expanded by 40%, you still have only 14% of the addressable market (flying privately).”

During the March-May 90-day period, NetJets flight hours were 56% higher than the same period in 2019, per Aviation Week.

Approximately $80 trillion of wealth is expected to be inherited over the next two decades, presenting a substantial opportunity for private aviation.

Gallagher said that while the industry is often labeled as a luxury, there are very different reasons customers fly privately.

They range from being able to return from work trips more quickly, creating more family time, visiting grandkids, avoiding airports, enjoying privacy and anonymity, as well as traveling with pets.

Last year, NetJets flew over 25,000 pets, including parrots and pot-bellied pigs.

NetJets addresses sustainability concerns by enabling flyers to offset carbon emissions.

It is also the largest private aviation buyer of sustainable aviation fuel.

Additionally, the unit of Berkshire Hathaway offsets all maintenance and administrative flights.

It also looks across its business on ways to increase sustainability, down to the packaging for inflight catering.

Top Private Jet Destinations

In terms of other trends, Gallagher said, “We’ve seen a migration to the sunbelt not just at NetJets but with high net worths overall, and with that we’ve seen less seasonality in places like Palm Beach and Naples, Florida, or Scottsdale, which are becoming very busy year-round. “

He added, “You see less of that up-and-down demand.”

Growth hotspots include Austin, Texas, Nashville, Tennessee, and Columbus, Ohio, where NetJets is headquartered.

Gallagher said there has been a dip in San Diego and Los Angeles,

However, the San Francisco/San Jose Bay area remains robust, and NetJets has its highest market share there.

“The tech money is investing in the shared economy,” he said.

Praise For Pilots

Gallagher also praised the company’s pilots, calling them “the best ambassadors we have for our brand, along with our flight attendants.”

Gallagher noted that pilots are the largest group of NetJets’ employees.

As is typical with most operators, most aircraft don’t have flight attendants, making pilots a key point of customer contact.

Last year, the company and the union representing its cockpit crews reached a new contract agreement.

It provides a 52.5% increase in compensation through 2029.",https://cdn.privatejetcardcomparisons.com/uploads/Screenshot-2025-06-19-at-8.39.08%E2%80%AFAM-e1750343458419.png?w=1200&h=628&fit=crop&auto=compress,N,,2025-06-19 13:15:29.185945

Under this collaboration, Neste will supply 7,500 metric tons—equivalent to 2.5 million gallons—of its neat Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel™ to support Amazon Air’s cargo operations at both San Francisco International Airport and Ontario International Airport through the end of 2025.

This agreement marks a significant milestone, as Amazon becomes the first company to use SAF at Ontario International Airport, one of the top 10 cargo airports in the United States. The initiative aligns with Amazon’s broader environmental strategy, which targets achieving net-zero carbon emissions across its global operations by 2040. The integration of SAF into its air cargo services is a vital component of Amazon’s decarbonization efforts.

The collaboration between Neste and Amazon is not new; it began in 2021 when Neste supplied SAF to Amazon at Germany's Cologne Bonn Airport. The current agreement expands their partnership to the U.S., strengthening both companies’ commitments to sustainable aviation.

Neste’s SAF is blended with conventional jet fuel and distributed into Amazon’s cargo flight operations at the two California airports. The first shipments were delivered earlier this year, marking a successful operational start. The fuel for San Francisco International Airport is delivered via existing pipeline infrastructure, leveraging Neste's SAF supply network established in Northern California in 2020.

For Ontario International Airport, Neste's SAF is transported by truck from its terminal facilities in Los Angeles. Diesel Direct, a long-standing logistics partner of Neste, manages the delivery process. Notably, Diesel Direct’s delivery trucks are powered by Neste’s renewable diesel, further minimizing the carbon footprint associated with transporting the SAF.

As demand for fossil-derived fuels declines, and competition from abroad intensifies, that number seems set to fall further. The surviving plants will likely be those that are already moving toward cleaner, more efficient, and more sustainable operation. This feature article from Andy Extance explores the possible future for refineries during the energy transition and beyond.

Phillips 66’s Humber refinery, for example, was fortuitously designed to produce graphite from heavy oils. Demand for graphite coke in battery electrodes means it has dramatically increased in value. That brings new revenue that has supported transition-oriented side projects at the refinery, for example to convert used vegetable oil into around 50 million litres/year of bio-derived sustainable aviation fuel (about 0.4% of its petroleum processing capacity).

Across the country at Stanlow, Essar Energy Transition (EET) Fuels has commissioned a new furnace that could eventually be fired with hydrogen, aiming to reduce the plant’s operating carbon emissions – although for now it will burn hydrocarbon gases produced as part of the refinery’s regular operations. Refineries produce (and use) most of the UK’s hydrogen (from reforming hydrocarbons) – if Stanlow can capture the CO2 emissions from hydrogen production, and heat its processes with that hydrogen, it would drastically lower the plant’s overall carbon footprint.

There is an argument that heat is perhaps not the best use of low-carbon hydrogen, given the demand from processes like fertiliser production, which chemically require hydrogen and therefore cannot be decarbonised any other way. Heat for many processes can be generated directly and more efficiently from electricity – as demonstrated in a petrochemical context at BASF’s pilot electric crackers in Ludwigshafen, Germany.

However, that technology is still in its infancy, so it’s relatively easy to see the attraction (from a refiner’s point of view) of enabling a potential switch to hydrogen as a heat source, while maintaining the ability to burn hydrocarbons. It requires relatively small modifications to existing plant infrastructure and employs fuels that the refiner already has ready access to, without forcing commitment to a definitive decarbonisation timeline.

This route allows some flexibility to both exert and respond to economic and political influences. That will be key to maintaining incentives for investment, since hydrogen-fuelled heating will always be more expensive than burning hydrocarbons directly. Increasing carbon emission prices (and taxing the emissions embodied in competing imports) provides more justification to invest in further efficiency improvements and emissions-lowering technology, as well as ensuring that it actually gets used to its full potential.",https://d2cbg94ubxgsnp.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/6/1/6/541616_shutterstock_2613449805_43528.jpg,N,,2025-06-19 12:17:04.646330

The company reiterates its goal of carbon-neutral operations by 2040 and details progress in emissions, electrification, facility power use and customer tools for lower-carbon logistics.

The report covers FedEx’s ESG activities, with data on fuel, electricity, renewables and Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.

With more than 100,000 suppliers and 730,000 jobs supported worldwide, FedEx’s energy transition spans a vast network in more than 220 countries and territories that together represent more than 99% of global GDP.

Jet fuel savings and sustainable aviation fuel

FedEx reports a 6.1% reduction in direct (Scope 1) emissions in FY24, including a 4.9% fall in jet fuel-related emissions.

Aircraft upgrades and improved fuel efficiency have cut aviation emissions intensity by 31% since 2005. FedEx is aiming for a 40% cut by 2034.

Combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity now stands at 179.50 metric tonnes of CO₂ equivalent per million USD in revenue, a 58% drop from FY09.

Over the same period, average daily package volume has grown by 121%.

Jet fuel conservation and aircraft upgrades saved around 140 million gallons of fuel and approximately US$400m in FY24.

To reduce aviation energy emissions further, FedEx commits to sourcing 30% of jet fuel from sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blends by 2030.

“As the world’s preeminent express transportation company, our initial US deployment of this fuel advances our sustainability goals and bolsters the aviation industry’s efforts to source and use more SAF,” says Richard Smith, Chief Operating Officer, International, and CEO, Airline, FedEx.

“While we know further growth of the SAF market is needed, alongside other innovations, we are proud to celebrate this milestone with our world-class air network.”

Still, less than 1% of global jet fuel in 2024 is SAF, highlighting supply constraints.

FedEx offsets unavoidable emissions through a US$100m investment in the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture.

Research focuses on durable removal techniques like enhanced weathering using basalt, a process that removes CO₂ from the atmosphere, lowers soil acidity and supports crop yields.

FedEx is also broadening its emissions tracking, adding Scope 3 Categories 3 (fuel and energy-related activities), 4 (upstream transport and distribution) and 6 (business travel).

It has pledged to adopt science-based targets, pending external validation.

Facilities shift to renewable electricity

Facility energy use accounts for around 6% of FedEx’s total emissions.

The company aims to transition all facilities to 100% renewable electricity by 2040, setting interim targets of 500 GWh by 2028 and 1,300 GWh by 2033.

In FY24, FedEx generated more than 31 GWh from solar panels across 34 sites and contracted 8 MW of new solar capacity for FY25.

Energy intensity, measured in terajoules per million USD revenue, has declined to 3.19.

Alongside this, FedEx introduced operational efficiencies like reusable mesh bags to replace plastic ones at FedEx Ground hubs.

This move prevented 50 million plastic bags from entering landfill and saved US$20.4m.

“Procuring SAF is an important component of our aviation emissions-reduction strategy in the coming years and we are pleased to have executed a deal with Neste to begin using this fuel in our air operations,” says Karen Blanks Ellis, Chief Sustainability Officer and Vice President of Environmental Affairs, FedEx.

“Our aviation network represents the largest amount of FedEx fuel use globally and, as a result, is our biggest opportunity to drive down emissions.

""As we work toward our goal of carbon-neutral operations by 2040, we need the SAF market to continue to grow to meet industry demand.”

Powering electric transport and customer tools

On the ground, FedEx operates more than 200,000 vehicles. Since 2005, it has improved fuel efficiency across its fleet by 40%.

The company acknowledges its original target of a 50% improvement by 2025 is unlikely to be met, due to changes under its Network 2.0 restructuring.

Nonetheless, its energy shift continues through fleet electrification. In FY24, FedEx had more than 8,000 electric vehicles (EVs) in service, including cargo bikes and trikes in Canada, the UK and Taiwan.

Following pilot schemes, it ordered 150 Shyft Group Blue Arc electric trucks with higher payload capacity.

It aims for 50% of all new parcel pickup and delivery (PUD) vehicle purchases to be electric by 2025, rising to100% by 2030.

The full PUD fleet, including contractor vehicles, is expected to be electric by 2040.

The MoU marks a decisive step toward removing those obstacles she added. By working with SAF aggregator, ATOBA Energy, “we are not just promoting SAF, we are looking at making it a viable, scalable solution for operators across our entire global network.”

The agreement will see the two companies explore physical delivery solutions to streamline SAF access for regional airlines. It will also see the two work on technical and regulatory support to help airlines seamlessly integrate SAF in their operations.

Making SAF more accessible for regional operators

The aim is to make SAF access simpler and more reliable for regional operations by creating reliable, seamless processes that are easy to use and safe to implement.

According to ATOBA Energy CEO, Arnaud Namer, the partnership will be a “powerful enabler for scaling SAF use across the industry.”

The partnership will also leverage ATOBA’s “book and claim” mass balancing model, enabling airlines to benefit from the environmental impact of SAF without needing physical access to the fuel. This said Namer is “especially critical for remote or underserved regions.” He also noted that “working with ATR, we’re creating practical, inclusive pathways to meaningful emission reduction in regional aviation.”

But as the airline rapidly expands, its overall climate impact is rising, with total emissions more than doubling since 2019.
Low-cost carriers like Wizz, Ryanair and EasyJet tend to have lower emissions per passenger than traditional airlines because they carry more people per flight.
“Our emissions per passenger remain among the lowest in the industry,” said Yvonne Moynihan, Wizz Air’s Corporate and ESG Officer.
“But we emphasize carbon intensity per passenger-kilometer as a more relevant metric for assessing environmental impact.” Long-Term Net Zero Strategy Wizz Air reiterated its ambition to reduce their emissions to almost zero by 2050.","Wizz Air, a Hungarian low-cost carrier, has cut emissions per passenger to some of the lowest levels in the industry. But as the airline rapidly expands, its overall climate impact is rising, with total emissions more than doubling since 2019.

In its latest sustainability report for the year ending March 2025, the low-cost airline said its carbon intensity - a measure of emissions per passenger - fell to 52.2 grams of CO₂ per passenger-kilometer.

That's lower than many of Wizz's rivals and the airline credits the low level to investment in part to more fuel-efficient aircraft.

Low-cost carriers like Wizz, Ryanair and EasyJet tend to have lower emissions per passenger than traditional airlines because they carry more people per flight. No business class, fewer empty seats, and tight cabin configurations all mean more passengers are sharing each litre of fuel.

In 2024, EasyJet reported 66.64 grams per passenger kilometre on average, while Ryanair averaged around 64 grams.

Fleet Strategy vs. Emissions Reality

Wizz added 26 new Airbus A321neo jets over the year, bringing its total fleet to 231 aircraft.

Most of those are NEO models, which are significantly more fuel efficient. Wizz said it aims to operate an all-NEO fleet by 2029.

“Our emissions per passenger remain among the lowest in the industry,” said Yvonne Moynihan, Wizz Air’s Corporate and ESG Officer. “This underscores our commitment to minimizing environmental impact on a per-flight basis.”

Because of the growth, despite carbon intensity improvements, Wizz Air’s absolute emissions have nearly doubled since 2019, a reminder that efficiency alone doesn’t equate to sustainability.

Moynihan attributed the rise to rapid expansion under Wizz Air’s “WIZZ500” vision, which targets a doubling of the fleet by 2033.

“This growth contributes to higher overall emissions,” she said. “But we emphasize carbon intensity per passenger-kilometer as a more relevant metric for assessing environmental impact.”

Long-Term Net Zero Strategy

Wizz Air reiterated its ambition to reduce their emissions to almost zero by 2050. The company said that this is structured around three pillars:

Aircraft fleet renewal: This will account for 30% of the planned reduction.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF): 53% of total fuel use by 2050.

Air traffic management and operational improvements: To help reduce emission by 4%.

Moynihan acknowledged that deeper emissions cuts will depend on scaling up SAF, which remains marginal across the industry. Wizz has not disclosed the current share of SAF in its operations.

“We are actively pursuing fleet renewal and operational efficiency,” Moynihan said. “But broader reforms are needed across the industry to ensure success.”

Amanda Nurse oversees a global team of engineers focused on one of bp’s most business-critical priorities: keeping its refineries running smoothly. Her team plays a central role in bp’s global reliability improvement programme, where they work to reduce operational disruptions and improve the long-term performance of bp’s refining and oil and gas assets.

This focus directly supports bp’s reset strategy and emphasis on operational performance.

“We’re not just fixing problems; we are building a culture of reliability,” Amanda says. “We’re constantly asking what could go wrong, and how do we stop it before it happens so we can support long-term stability and growth.”

In her role as a reliability discipline lead, she has put a range of programmes in place, including vulnerability studies and root cause analyses to help identify potential issues before they escalate into shutdowns. Today, many of the tools she has helped to put in place are standard across bp’s refining operations.

“It’s about being rigorously data driven and making the right investments, at the right time, in the right places,” she says. “One of the exciting things about reliability is seeing how a small insight like a weak signal in a vibration pattern can lead to a big win for safety, performance and cost.”

Amanda’s approach was shaped by hands-on experience. Early in her career, she worked as a maintenance and reliability engineer at the Whiting refinery, where she often needed to solve operational challenges.

“A big part of my role at that time was ‘putting on patches’, responding to failure after failure. That’s when I discovered the tools that help you to get in front of problems instead of chasing them,” she says.

As one of the few women in her field early on, Amanda is encouraged by the growing visibility of women in engineering roles across bp.

“For a long time, I was the only woman in the room,” she says. “Now, I see more women stepping into leadership, shaping strategy, and driving change. That diversity of thought is essential. It’s how we solve the toughest problems.”

Improving performance

At bp’s Gelsenkirchen refinery in Germany, Courtney Pellechi is helping to keep performance improvement on track during a time of change.

With the site currently positioned for potential sale, she sees the team’s commitment and passion towards their improvement agenda as essential elements of success.

“The transformation progress wouldn't have been as advanced if the team hadn't done a tremendous job in recent years improving safety and reliability,” she says. “We’re committed to the future of the site and our focus remains on maintaining and strengthening our safety, reliability and competitiveness.”

Courtney’s career began at Whiting refinery in Indiana, US, where she worked in engineering maintenance and operational roles. After 13 years there, she joined bp’s Cherry Point refinery in Washington State for three years before moving to Germany in 2024.

Now, as maintenance and reliability manager at Gelsenkirchen, Courtney is an integral member of the team driving the refinery’s ongoing improvement plan and a strong advocate of the collaborative mindset that sees refining teams proactively sharing knowledge across countries and regions.

“We have strong networks across sites that include maintenance managers, reliability leads and more. We learn from each other and apply those lessons quickly,” she says.

Courtney’s love of problem solving and her passion for science and numbers meant a career in engineering was a natural next step. She studied mechanical engineering and then successfully competed for a role at bp, after the Society of Women Engineers helped her to identify the opportunity.

“It’s not just about recruiting engineers,” she says. “It’s about bringing in people from different places, schools and backgrounds. That’s how you build better teams.”

Advancing digital

At Castellón refinery in Spain, Mercedes Casamayor is helping to modernize how work gets done in one of bp’s most operationally complex environments.

As reliability superintendent, she’s leading a shift from paper-based systems to digital tools, replacing clipboards with tablets and enabling smarter and more consistent data analysis.

“The job of my team is to understand why failures happen, analyse the data from corrective, preventive and predictive tasks, and propose what we can do differently to avoid them. It’s about making sure equipment is available most of the time, so the refinery keeps running smoothly,” she says. “When refinery maintenance is digital, we can spot patterns, act faster and make better decisions.”

Mercedes joined Castellón refinery in 2004, moving between engineering and maintenance and reliability roles. One of her proudest achievements was leading the installation of a new system that improved site-based emissions-monitoring – an ambitious project that required interpreting new legislation and building a custom solution from scratch. Years later, when she saw vendor companies selling similar systems, she realized just how far ahead her team had been.

Her passion for engineering began with a love of physics in high school, and she went on to study industrial engineering, enjoying its breadth and flexibility.",https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/images-jpg-png/news-and-insights/bp-magazine/inwed-courtney-whiting-refinery-hero.png,N,,2025-06-19 12:17:38.463725

The company confirms its target to achieve carbon-neutral operations by 2040, setting out progress made in areas ranging from aircraft fuel savings to EV rollout.

The report covers initiatives within ESG criteria, including detailed data on emissions, renewable energy use, workforce development and low-carbon customer solutions.

FedEx operates globally across a vast supply chain of more than 100,000 suppliers and supports 730,000 jobs.

Its global reach spans 220 countries and territories, representing more than 99% of world GDP.

Emissions cuts and shift to sustainable aviation fuel

FedEx reports a 6.1% year-on-year drop in its direct (Scope 1) emissions in FY24. These include emissions from vehicles and aircraft.

Jet fuel-related emissions have dropped by 4.9% as a result of improvements in fuel efficiency and continued aircraft modernisation.

Since 2005, aviation emissions intensity has fallen by 31%, with the company targeting a 40% drop by 2034.

Scope 2 emissions (indirect emissions from purchased energy) also contribute to an overall 58% reduction in emissions intensity since FY09, now down to 179.50 metric tonnes of CO₂ equivalent per million USD in revenue. This is despite package volumes more than doubling by 121%.

FedEx’s efforts to reduce aviation fuel use saved approximately 140 million gallons of jet fuel and an estimated US$400m in FY24 alone.

The company plans to source 30% of its jet fuel from sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blends by 2030.

""As the world’s preeminent express transportation company, our initial US deployment of this fuel advances our sustainability goals and bolsters the aviation industry’s efforts to source and use more SAF,"" says Richard Smith, Chief Operating Officer, International, and CEO, Airline, FedEx.

""While we know further growth of the SAF market is needed, alongside other innovations, we are proud to celebrate this milestone with our world-class air network.""

The report highlights that less than 1% of global jet fuel production in 2024 is SAF, indicating the scale of the challenge ahead.

To compensate for unavoidable emissions, FedEx has invested US$100m in the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture.

This includes research into enhanced weathering, a method that uses basalt to absorb CO₂ while improving soil health and crop yields.

FedEx is expanding its carbon reporting to include Scope 3 emissions in three categories:

Category 3 (fuel and energy-related activities)

Category 4 (upstream transportation and distribution)

Category 6 (business travel)

The company also commits to science-based targets that are pending third-party validation.

Electric fleet rollout and grid readiness

FedEx runs more than 200,000 ground vehicles, ranging from parcel delivery vans to long-haul trucks and off-road equipment.

From a 2005 baseline, vehicle fuel efficiency has improved by 40% in FY24. However, the company's original goal of a 50% increase by 2025 is unlikely to be achieved, due in part to structural changes under its Network 2.0 reorganisation.

Despite this, the shift to electrification within the business continues. More than 8,000 electric vehicles are now operating across the FedEx network, including e-cargo bikes and trikes used in the UK, Canada and Taiwan.

Following testing, FedEx ordered 150 Blue Arc electric trucks from the Shyft Group, designed to handle higher capacity.

FedEx is also targeting 50% of all new parcel pickup and delivery (PUD) vehicle purchases to be electric by 2025, reaching 100% by 2030.

The company's entire contracted and company-owned PUD fleet is set to be fully electric by 2040. To support the shift, FedEx is investing in charging infrastructure and collaborating with utility firms and regulators to build out grid capacity.

The company backs RMI’s GridUp tool with more than US$2.5m to help forecast electricity demand from EV charging.

""Procuring SAF is an important component of our aviation emissions-reduction strategy in the coming years and we are pleased to have executed a deal with Neste to begin using this fuel in our air operations,"" comments Karen Blanks Ellis, Chief Sustainability Officer and Vice President of Environmental Affairs at FedEx.

""Our aviation network represents the largest amount of FedEx fuel use globally and, as a result, is our biggest opportunity to drive down emissions.

""As we work toward our goal of carbon-neutral operations by 2040, we need the SAF market to continue to grow to meet industry demand.""

Around 6% of total emissions come from facilities. FedEx aims to use 100% renewable electricity at these sites by 2040, with targets set at 500 GWh by 2028 and 1,300 GWh by 2033.

In FY24, FedEx generated more than 31 GWh of solar power across 34 global locations and signs contracts to add another 8 MW in FY25.

Facility energy intensity declined to 3.19 terajoules per million USD revenue.

The NetZero Forecaster sits inside the Thrust Calculator and lets companies see the impact of various policy changes on meeting their carbon goals, said Tan Strehler-Weston, Thrust Carbon's head of operations and policy. For example, they can hypothesize a policy change in business-class allowance or use of rail in lieu of short-haul flights as well as the timing of that policy change, and the tool can show the impact of that change.

Users also can model the impact of choosing more fuel-efficient routes and aircraft, reducing travel or the cost and impact of purchasing sustainable aviation fuel.

With those forecasts, travel managers can find the ""least painful way"" of meeting their carbon reduction targets, Strehler-Weston said.

With the integration to a company's live emissions data, the results are specific to a program, he said. If a program already has most travelers flying in economy class, for example, the business-class policy change would have less impact than it would for a company with a high rate of business-class use.

""It's a dynamic forecasting tool,"" he said. ""You don't need to rebuild the tool every year as the travel program changes.""

The tool also has the capability of factoring in larger industry shifts, such as airlines adding more fuel-efficient aircraft. ""If you're a travel manager, you don't have time to look into those things, and you don't know whether your consultants will do that for you,"" Strehler-Weston said.

Thrust Carbon today is switching on the forecasting tool for a handful of early-access clients, who will provide feedback, and it then will be more widely available as an add-on to the calculator tool, he said.

This includes a 4.9% cut in jet fuel emissions from its aircraft, thanks to fleet modernisation and better efficiency.
Electric fleets and smart infrastructure FedEx operates more than 200,000 vehicles, covering pickup and delivery (PUD), long-haul and off-road use.
In FY24, the company deployed more than 8,000 electric vehicles, including e-cargo bikes and trikes in Canada, the UK and Taiwan.
Reusable solutions like the Reusable Padded Pak and Reusable Pak are available, and FedEx continues to work with the Circular Supply Chain Coalition.","FedEx is pressing ahead with its net-zero plans, setting the pace on fleet electrification and logistics innovation while scaling greener operations across its vast supply chain.

Its 2025 Corporate Responsibility Report details how the company is cutting emissions, investing in new fuels and improving efficiency across both air and ground networks, all while pushing for greater circularity in packaging and delivery.

FedEx’s global network includes more than 100,000 suppliers and supports around 730,000 jobs. Connecting more than 220 countries and territories, the company links markets that together generate more than 99% of global GDP. That scale brings complexity - and a large carbon footprint - but FedEx is working to change how it moves goods around the world by cutting emissions and embedding sustainability into its core logistics services.

Targeting carbon across the chain

The company is reducing carbon emissions in several areas of its operations, especially through its climate strategy, which covers direct emissions (Scope 1), indirect emissions from purchased energy (Scope 2) and selected indirect emissions along the supply chain (Scope 3).

In the financial year 2024 (FY24), FedEx reduced Scope 1 emissions by 6.1% year-on-year. This includes a 4.9% cut in jet fuel emissions from its aircraft, thanks to fleet modernisation and better efficiency.

Since 2005, aviation emissions intensity (the amount of emissions per unit of activity) has dropped 31% and the company is aiming for a 40% reduction by 2034.

Overall Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity now stands at 179.50 metric tons of CO₂ equivalent per million USD in revenue, down 58% from FY09 levels, despite daily package volumes rising by an average of 121%.

FedEx’s fuel-saving programmes are also delivering financial returns. Conservation efforts and aircraft upgrades saved approximately 140 million gallons of jet fuel in FY24, which the company estimates has avoided around US$400m in fuel costs.

A key part of the emissions-reduction strategy is the shift to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). FedEx plans to have 30% of its jet fuel come from SAF blends by 2030.

As Richard Smith, Chief Operating Officer, and Fedex Airline CEO, explains: “As the world’s preeminent express transportation company, our initial US deployment of this fuel advances our sustainability goals and bolsters the aviation industry’s efforts to source and use more SAF.”

But less than 1% of jet fuel produced globally in 2024 was SAF, highlighting the challenges of scaling up.

To address unavoidable emissions, FedEx has invested US$100m in the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture, supporting research into long-term carbon removal, including enhanced weathering—a method using basalt to sequester CO₂ while also improving soil quality.

The company has also expanded its emissions reporting to include Scope 3 categories 3, 4 and 6, which refer to fuel and energy-related activities, upstream transportation, distribution and business travel. FedEx has committed to science-based targets, pending validation.

Electric fleets and smart infrastructure

FedEx operates more than 200,000 vehicles, covering pickup and delivery (PUD), long-haul and off-road use. From a 2005 baseline, vehicle fuel efficiency is now 40% better. While a target of 50% improvement by 2025 is unlikely due to restructuring under the Network 2.0 initiative, progress on fleet electrification continues.

In FY24, the company deployed more than 8,000 electric vehicles, including e-cargo bikes and trikes in Canada, the UK and Taiwan. After running pilots, FedEx placed an order for 150 Shyft Group Blue Arc electric trucks with larger cargo space to better support logistics needs.

The aim is for 50% of new PUD vehicle purchases to be electric by 2025, moving to 100% by 2030. By 2040, the full PUD fleet, including contractors’ vehicles, is expected to be electric.

To support this transition, FedEx is expanding its charging infrastructure and working with regulators and utilities to scale grid capacity. It’s invested more than US$2.5m in RMI’s GridUp tool, which helps energy providers forecast demand from electric transport.

Karen Blanks Ellis, Chief Sustainability Officer and Vice President of Environmental Affairs, FedEx, says: “Our aviation network represents the largest amount of FedEx fuel use globally and, as a result, is our biggest opportunity to drive down emissions.

""As we work toward our goal of carbon-neural operations by 2040, we need the SAF market to continue to grow to meet industry demand.”

Facilities contribute around 6% of FedEx’s emissions. The company wants to source all facility electricity from renewables by 2040, targeting 500 GWh by 2028 and 1,300 GWh by 2033. In FY24, 31 GWh of solar power came from 34 sites, with 8 MW more solar capacity scheduled for FY25. Energy intensity across operations dropped to 3.19 terajoules per million USD in revenue.

On the packaging front, a mesh bag project at FedEx Ground hubs prevented 50 million plastic bags from ending up in landfill and saved US$20.4m.

Packaging and customer-focused circular tools

Handling more than 17 million shipments each day, FedEx is using that scale to promote more sustainable practices among customers.

Its FedEx Sustainability Insights tool, now live in more than 100 markets, gives businesses estimated CO₂e emissions data for their shipments. More than 13,000 customers have accessed the platform since July 2023, helping with Scope 3 emissions planning and reporting.

FedEx also prioritises circularity in its own packaging. In FY24, 74% of packaging materials were sourced from third-party certified sustainable suppliers. Reusable solutions like the Reusable Padded Pak and Reusable Pak are available, and FedEx continues to work with the Circular Supply Chain Coalition. This initiative backs the recovery and reuse of rare earth elements, builds remanufacturing centres and supports high-skill job creation in local communities.

Offering a huge reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and compatibility with existing aircraft infrastructure, SAF is no longer just an experimental idea, it’s a vital part of aviation’s roadmap to a net-zero future.

But what exactly is SAF, how does it work, and why is it gaining such momentum now? We are going to explore the science, potential, and growing market behind SAF, along with the critical role that testing and quality assurance companies like Precision Analyzer Company (PAC) play in ensuring it meets industry standards. From feedstock to flight, we will delve into how SAF is reshaping aviation and what it will take to scale this cleaner fuel to global levels.

What is SAF?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a renewable, low-carbon alternative to traditional fossil-based jet fuel. It is produced from sustainable feedstocks like used cooking oil, agricultural residues, algae, and even municipal solid waste. SAF is chemically similar to conventional jet fuel, making it a “drop-in” replacement so that it can be used in existing aircraft and infrastructure without modifications.

SAF is part of a broader family of sustainable fuels, which also includes bioethanol, biodiesel, hydrogen fuel, and synthetic fuels (e-fuels). These fuels are designed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and dependence on fossil fuels, offering a cleaner path forward for industries like aviation that are hard to decarbonize.

Why SAF?

The aviation sector contributes approximately 2–3% of global CO₂ emissions, and with increasing air traffic, this figure is expected to rise. SAF presents one of the most practical and immediate opportunities to reduce aviation’s environmental impact. It offers up to 80% reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional jet fuel, depending on the feedstock and production process used. Beyond CO₂ reduction, SAF also contributes to better air quality by emitting lower levels of sulfur dioxide (SO₂), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter. This can significantly improve environmental conditions around airports and reduce public health risks in nearby communities.

Perhaps one of SAF’s strongest advantages is its compatibility with existing aircraft engines and airport fuel infrastructure. It meets the same stringent performance and safety standards as conventional jet fuel, making it a viable substitute with minimal operational barriers. However, challenges such as limited feedstock availability, high production costs, and the need for scaling up manufacturing remain. Addressing these barriers is crucial for widespread SAF adoption, and ongoing collaboration across industry, government, and research institutions is key to making this shift a reality.

Market Potential for SAF

The global SAF market is poised for rapid growth as governments and industries increase their commitment to reducing carbon emissions. With more airlines pledging to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, SAF has become a cornerstone of many corporate sustainability strategies. Policy frameworks and government incentives are accelerating SAF production and use, while investor interest in clean aviation technologies continues to grow.

Since the first SAF-powered test flight in 2008, more than 400,000 commercial flights have utilized SAF in various blend ratios. Although current global SAF production accounts for a small fraction of total jet fuel demand, capacity is expected to expand significantly in the coming years. Analysts project that SAF could make up a considerable portion of aviation fuel consumption by 2030, particularly if technological advancements and supportive policies align to overcome existing constraints.

SAF Production Pathways

There are several technologically validated and approved pathways for SAF production, each utilizing different raw materials and processing techniques. One of the most established methods is the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway, which converts waste oils or animal fats into jet fuel through hydroprocessing. The Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis process is another major route, where biomass like agricultural residue or wood chips is first gasified into synthesis gas (syngas), and then converted into liquid hydrocarbons.

Another innovative method is Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ), which involves converting ethanol or butanol into jet fuel by dehydrating the alcohol to produce olefins, then oligomerizing and hydrogenating them to form jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons. Additional pathways include Synthesized Iso-Paraffins (SIP) derived from fermented sugars, and Catalytic Hydrothermolysis (CHJ), which uses lipids processed under high pressure and temperature. Newer technologies like HC-HEFA focus on algae-based feedstocks, while co-processing techniques allow SAF components to be blended with fossil-derived fuels during conventional refining.

Each of these pathways must meet rigorous performance and safety standards to be approved for commercial use. As of today, nine SAF pathways have been approved, with others under evaluation and balloting, reflecting the sector’s dynamic and fast-paced innovation landscape.

This effort is part of a larger plan to dramatically reduce the airline’s carbon footprint and push the aviation industry toward net-zero emissions. SAF is made from renewable resources like agricultural waste, algae, or recycled cooking oil, and it can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

For airlines, it offers one of the few immediate options to cut greenhouse gases without sacrificing flight range or performance. However, the scale of this transition poses serious questions about feasibility. Is SAF production capacity and supply chain ready to meet the demands of a major carrier like United within the next decade? Will the costs of SAF remain prohibitively high compared to conventional jet fuel, potentially affecting ticket prices?

The European Union’s “Fit for 55” package represents one of the most ambitious climate policy frameworks in the world, aiming to reduce GHG emissions by at least 55% by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels) and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. As a growing source of emissions, the aviation sector is directly addressed in this wide-ranging legislative bundle through multiple complementary measures. In this article, we explore how Fit for 55 is reshaping the future of European and global aviation through regulatory, fiscal, and infrastructure-based reforms, with a special focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

The Pillars of Fit for 55 Impacting Aviation

Fit for 55 is not a single regulation but a comprehensive suite of policy updates. The most aviation-relevant pillars include:

ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation

Revision of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)

Energy Taxation Directive (ETD) Revision

Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR)

These policies are strategically interlinked to create demand, reduce emissions, and drive investment in low-carbon aviation technologies.

ReFuelEU Aviation: Fueling the SAF Revolution

One of the most impactful components for aviation under the Fit for 55 framework is the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, which introduces binding mandates for the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) across the European Union. This regulation is designed to create a unified market demand signal and drive the production, distribution, and use of SAF at scale.

Under the regulation, fuel suppliers must ensure that all jet fuel made available at EU airports contains a minimum share of SAF. Starting in 2025, this blending mandate is set at 2%, and it increases incrementally every five years to reach 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. Importantly, the mandate also requires that a growing proportion of the SAF component consists of synthetic aviation fuels, or e-fuels, which are derived from renewable electricity and captured CO2. By 2050, at least 35% of the SAF blended into jet fuel must be synthetic.

The regulation applies to all departing flights from EU airports, regardless of the airline’s country of origin, thereby preventing competitive distortions and carbon leakage. To ensure transparency and accountability, fuel suppliers and airlines are obligated to report the volumes and sustainability credentials of the fuel they use. Annual compliance checks and penalties for non-conformance are built into the legislation, creating robust enforcement mechanisms.

ReFuelEU Aviation not only addresses supply-side challenges by stimulating SAF production but also reinforces demand certainty for the aviation industry. It incentivizes airlines to incorporate SAF into their decarbonization strategies and encourages long-term investment in SAF technologies and infrastructure. As such, the regulation is a cornerstone of the EU’s strategy to make sustainable flying a commercially viable and operationally scalable reality by mid-century.

EU ETS Reform: Full Emissions Accountability

The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) has undergone substantial reforms to align more closely with the ambitious decarbonization targets laid out in the Fit for 55 package. One of the most significant changes is the complete elimination of free emissions allowances for intra-EU flights, starting in 2024. From this point forward, airlines operating within the European Union are required to purchase allowances for 100% of their verified CO2 emissions. This shift marks a clear departure from earlier leniencies and establishes a firmer price signal on carbon.

In addition to the end of free allowances, the overall emissions cap for the aviation sector under the EU ETS will be reduced annually, further tightening the system. This progressive reduction is designed to ensure that aviation emissions decline in tandem with the EU’s broader climate objectives. Airlines must now factor these escalating costs into their long-term operational planning.

One of the most forward-looking aspects of the reform is the integration of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into the ETS framework. Since SAF emits significantly fewer lifecycle emissions than conventional jet fuel, its use results in reduced compliance obligations under the ETS. This makes SAF not only an environmental solution but also a financially strategic one, as it can lower the overall cost burden of emissions compliance.

Ultimately, this reform raises the effective carbon price for airlines and introduces stronger financial incentives to accelerate the adoption of low-emission fuels and more efficient aircraft technologies. It reinforces the message that polluting less is not just a moral imperative, it is an economic necessity in the EU’s evolving aviation landscape.

Tax Reform and Infrastructure Investment

Energy Taxation Directive (ETD) Revision:

As part of the Fit for 55 legislative suite, the revision of the Energy Taxation Directive (ETD) introduces critical fiscal reforms that target fossil fuel use in aviation. Historically, kerosene used for intra-EU flights was exempt from taxation, effectively subsidizing carbon-intensive air travel. Under the new rules, this exemption will be phased out beginning in 2025. Airlines operating within the EU will gradually be required to pay taxes on their fossil fuel consumption, increasing the cost of high-emission operations.

In parallel, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is granted preferential tax treatment. This includes reduced or zero tax rates to improve its price competitiveness relative to kerosene. By creating a financial differential between fossil-based and renewable fuels, the directive provides a clear incentive for airlines to transition to SAF as a more economically viable option over time.

Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR):

To support the practical deployment of SAF at scale, the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) mandates that major EU airports invest in the necessary infrastructure. This includes the development of facilities for SAF storage, on-site blending, and dedicated refueling systems that ensure seamless integration with existing operations.

The regulation ensures that supply chain bottlenecks do not undermine SAF adoption. By requiring airports to be SAF-ready, the EU is proactively addressing the logistical challenges associated with distributing new fuel types. This foresight is crucial to aligning infrastructure with regulatory mandates and industry targets.

Together, the tax reforms and infrastructure investments function as a balanced policy mechanism—offering financial incentives for sustainable practices while gradually phasing out subsidies for polluting fuels. This dual approach is designed to accelerate the aviation sector’s transition toward lower-emission operations in a structured and enforceable manner.

Market Implications and Global Influence

The Fit for 55 package sets a global benchmark for aviation climate policy, significantly influencing both regional operations and global strategies. One of the most prominent effects is the surge in investment into SAF production capacity across Europe. Driven by clear regulatory targets and supportive incentives, fuel producers are ramping up infrastructure to meet the anticipated demand for low-carbon aviation fuel.

Meanwhile, airlines that continue to rely heavily on fossil-based jet fuels are encountering higher compliance costs. The tightening of emissions regulations and the removal of traditional tax exemptions are creating strong financial pressures, prompting companies to reconfigure fleet operations, fuel sourcing, and sustainability strategies.

Technological innovation is also accelerating. As SAF requirements become stricter and long-term decarbonization goals loom, there is a growing push to advance alternative propulsion methods such as electric and hydrogen-powered aviation. These emerging technologies, while still nascent, are beginning to attract increased R&D investments as the industry seeks long-term solutions.

Internationally, Fit for 55 is already generating a ripple effect. Airlines outside the EU, especially those operating flights to or from Europe, are compelled to adapt to these stringent rules. This global spillover effect not only amplifies the EU’s influence but also encourages other jurisdictions to strengthen their own aviation climate policies.

Already, fuel producers, airlines, and airport authorities are aligning capital expenditures to meet Fit for 55 mandates. Moreover, the package complements international measures such as ICAO’s CORSIA, but with stronger enforcement and timelines.

Conclusion

The EU’s Fit for 55 package is transforming aviation from a hard-to-abate sector into a climate innovation frontier. Through coordinated policy levers such as SAF mandates, emissions pricing, taxation reform, and infrastructure development, the initiative creates a robust ecosystem for decarbonizing air travel. While challenges remain around cost, scalability, and international harmonization, Europe’s regulatory clarity is providing a flightpath toward net-zero aviation by 2050. As other regions evaluate their own approaches, Fit for 55 stands as a model of integrated, enforceable, and future-ready climate governance.

Known as Furanos-to-Jet (FTJ), the method leverages furans—compounds formed during biomass degradation—as precursors for jet fuel.

Dr. Gabriel Contreras Zarazúa, a chemical engineering expert and lead researcher, highlighted the FTJ process's advantages over existing SAF production methods like Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ). He explained that furans offer properties essential for SAF, such as suitable freezing points and densities, which alcohol-based intermediates lack.

Developed entirely in Mexico, the FTJ process earned third place in the 2025 Airbus SAF Award, presented during the 2025 Aerospace Fair (FAMEX). This recognition underscores the project’s importance in advancing sustainable aviation in the country.

Dr. Contreras Zarazúa estimates that SAF production in Mexico could begin within two to three years but identifies a key obstacle: insufficient collaboration between academia and industry. “There are many excellent ideas in academia with scaling potential, but no connection with industry,” he told A21.

He also stressed the need to engage with farmers who produce the biomass necessary for SAF. “The missing piece is the entire biomass supply chain. Once that is in place, building the technology will be the easiest part,” he added.

Regarding infrastructure, Dr. Contreras Zarazúa suggested repurposing existing facilities from Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) but advocated for dedicated biorefineries near biomass sources to reduce costs and emissions. For instance, sugarcane residues could be processed in coastal areas, while agave waste would require specialized facilities in Jalisco, tailored to local agricultural byproducts.

By securing strategic partnerships and diversifying its feedstock supply, the company is building a scalable and secure foundation to capitalize on soaring demand for low-carbon fuels. This article explores how TotalEnergies' recent moves—particularly its focus on feedstock security and production capacity expansions—could drive long-term growth, making it a compelling investment in the energy transition.

Strategic Partnerships: Building the SAF Ecosystem

TotalEnergies has woven a network of partnerships that span research, production, and distribution. Its collaboration with Safran, a major aerospace supplier, began in 2021 and has already yielded breakthroughs, such as a SAF-blend flight in a military helicopter in 2023. The partnership with Airbus, announced in 2024, is even more significant: it aims to supply over half of Airbus's European SAF needs and co-develop next-generation fuels compatible with 100% SAF use.

These alliances are not just about R&D—they're about scaling production. In France, the Grandpuits biorefinery, a €500 million project, will produce 230,000 tons of SAF annually by 2026. Meanwhile, the La Mède biorefinery has already begun blending SAF into jet fuel for southern French airports.

Feedstock Security: The Key to Scalability

The aviation sector's shift to SAF hinges on one critical factor: access to reliable, low-carbon feedstocks. TotalEnergies has addressed this head-on through long-term agreements. In June 2025, it signed a 15-year deal with Quatra, a European leader in used cooking oil (UCO) collection, securing 60,000 tons of UCO annually starting in 2026. UCO-based fuels reduce lifecycle emissions by 70–80% compared to fossil fuels and offer a steady, non-food-based feedstock.

The company also partners with SARIA, which supplies organic waste from agriculture and households to Grandpuits. By diversifying its feedstock sources—UCO, agricultural waste, and other non-food biomass—TotalEnergies mitigates supply risks and ensures its fuels meet stringent EU sustainability criteria.

Regulatory Tailwinds: The EU's Role in Fueling Growth

The EU's ReFuelEU mandate requires airlines to blend 2% SAF by 2025, rising to 6% by 2030. TotalEnergies is not just meeting these targets—it's exceeding them. By 2028, the company aims to supply over 500,000 tons/year of SAF, enabling it to deliver 10% SAF in jet fuel volumes in Europe by 2030—a full four years ahead of regulatory requirements.

This proactive stance positions TotalEnergies as a supplier of choice for airlines like Air France-KLM, which signed a landmark 10-year deal for up to 1.5 million tons of SAF. Such agreements lock in demand, stabilizing revenue streams and reducing financial risk.

Financial Resilience and Risk Mitigation

TotalEnergies' $6.5 billion annual renewables budget (including biorefineries) underscores its commitment to the transition. Its refinery upgrades—such as coprocessing SAF at Antwerp and Leuna—are cost-effective, leveraging existing infrastructure. Long-term feedstock and offtake agreements further insulate the company from commodity price volatility.

Investment Thesis: A Leader in the Aviation Transition

The data tells a compelling story. Over the past three years, TotalEnergies' stock has outperformed peers like BP and Shell, reflecting investor confidence in its green strategy.

Why invest now?

1. Scalability: TotalEnergies' production capacity is set to grow from ~250,000 tons/year in 2025 to over 500,000 tons/year by 2028—a 100% increase in just three years.

2. Feedstock Security: Its partnerships ensure a stable, low-carbon supply chain, critical as SAF demand surges.

3. Regulatory Tailwinds: The EU's mandates create a guaranteed market, while TotalEnergies' overperformance positions it to capture premium pricing.

Conclusion: A Bridge to Net-Zero Aviation

TotalEnergies has masterfully combined strategic partnerships, feedstock diversification, and regulatory foresight to build a dominant position in SAF. Its ability to scale production while securing supply lines makes it a standout play in the energy transition. Investors seeking exposure to decarbonization should take note: TotalEnergies is not just adapting to the future—it's designing it.

The deal reflects the European Union’s big ambitions for SAF, with a mandatory 2% blend in 2025 and a target of 70% by 2050.

Intermediate crops that do not compete with food production

Intermediate crops are planted between main crops on the same plot. Therefore, they require no additional land and do not compete with the production of food or animal feed, while providing farmers with an additional income stream. Under EU regulations, they qualify for SAF production.

These crops also lead to the production of vegetable protein, contributing to French and European sovereignty in animal feed. They also have a number of agronomic benefits: preventing soil erosion by improving its structure, reducing water loss and helping preserve biodiversity.

Vegetable oils that qualify for SAF production

Under the terms of the agreement, TotalEnergies and Avril will jointly assess the entirety of the value chain, from plant variety selection to SAF production, in order to establish viable activity in France.

Avril will supply vegetable oils from the intermediate crops to TotalEnergies, which will turn them into SAF in its French biorefineries and in its French and European refineries through coprocessing,

“The deal with Avril marks a significant step towards the development of a French industry producing vegetable oil for SAF production.

This pioneering agreement underscores a shared commitment to meet the European Union's ambitious mandates for SAF incorporation, starting at 2% by 2025 and escalating to a formidable 70% by 2050.

The collaboration focuses on leveraging ""intermediate crops"" – plants sown between two main harvests on the same plot of land. This innovative approach offers a dual advantage: it avoids competition with food and animal feed production, thereby addressing concerns about land use, and simultaneously provides additional income for farmers. Crucially, these intermediate crops are fully compliant with European regulations for SAF production.

Beyond their role in sustainable fuel, these crops also yield valuable plant proteins, directly contributing to France and Europe's protein sovereignty for animal feed. Furthermore, the agronomic benefits of intercropping are substantial, including reduced soil erosion, improved soil structure, decreased water loss, and enhanced biodiversity – all vital aspects of sustainable agriculture.

Under the terms of the agreement, TotalEnergies and Avril will conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the entire value chain. This will span from the meticulous selection of optimal plant varieties to the final production of biofuels. Avril, with its deep expertise in the French vegetable oils and proteins sector, will be responsible for supplying the vegetable oils derived from these intermediate crops to TotalEnergies. TotalEnergies, in turn, will process these oils into sustainable aviation fuels at its French biorefineries, such as La Mède and Grandpuits, and through co-processing at its French and European refineries. The Grandpuits biorefinery, for instance, is set to have an annual SAF production capacity of 230,000 tons by 2026.

This collaboration signifies a proactive and integrated approach to tackling aviation's environmental footprint. By fostering a domestic supply chain for SAF derived from non-food competing crops, France aims to solidify its position in the green energy transition and set a precedent for sustainable agricultural practices within the European Union's ambitious climate goals. The partnership is expected to drive innovation in agricultural techniques and biofuel production, contributing significantly to a greener future for air transport.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-18 14:08:06.920959

How? Thanks to a third generation of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) called e-fuel, or “power to liquid” fuel.

Experts say that the science is actually surprisingly straightforward. The main problem the aviation industry must overcome is cost.

According to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, e-fuels cost $8,720 per ton, compared to bio-based SAF at $2,365 per ton and conventional jet fuel at $830 per ton.

Conor Madigan, CEO at Aether Fuels, explained that e-fuel is made by converting carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere or industrial emissions into carbon monoxide (CO) via direct electrolysis or in combination with hydrogen.

The carbon dioxide and hydrogen can then be combined to create various hydrocarbon compounds that can be refined into jet fuel.

Duncan McCourt, CEO of Sustainable Aviation, points out that when burned, it emits the carbon. That means it’s entirely net zero if a renewable energy plant is used to make it. And unlike with bio-feed SAF, feedstock limits and land-use concerns aren’t factors.

The hurdle, Mr McCourt tells The Independent, is “scaling it to commercial levels and doing so at a reasonable cost”.

Mr Madigan explains further, revealing that the cost of e-fuel plants “is high and the scarcity of the kind of hydrogen required under current policies restricts projects to smaller scale operations”.

This, he says, “leads to poor cost efficiency and very high prices to generate acceptable capital returns”.

Mr Madigan continues: “There are only two markets where policies exist to incentivize 'CO2 plus H2' fuels, the UK and EU, and they allow the use of only waste hydrogen or green hydrogen.

“Many companies have sought ways to reduce capital expenditure, but most approaches compromise yield in the process.”

Mr Madigan explains that capturing CO2 from the atmosphere is “very energy-intensive and therefore very expensive” but that this problem makes a smaller contribution to the price of the fuel.

So, what’s the solution?

It’s partly in the hands of politicians.

Mr McCourt says: “The cost of the energy required to produce hydrogen and capture carbon at scale is one of the primary challenges.

“Overcoming this will require significant investment and supportive governmental policy.”

And would the aviation industry embrace “thin-air” fuel? It would seem likely, with several carriers already experimenting with alternative ways to power flight.","https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/18/17/45/iStock-2152046671.jpeg?trim=16,178,29,173&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-06-18 14:08:22.924367

Located in the heart of the Amazon, it has been billed as Brazil’s first sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project, but the palm oil producer behind a planned biorefinery in Manaus is now grappling with a financial crisis triggered by concern over possible rights abuses.

Reporting in the region by Brazilian news outlet InfoAmazonia in partnership with Climate Home News, has also found that the company – São Paulo-based Brasil BioFuels (Grupo BBF) – is growing oil palm on three areas subject to sanctions by Brazil’s Ibama environmental agency over illegal deforestation.

The embargoed plots lie in São João da Baliza, a sparsely populated district strung along the highway where former grazing pasture and biodiversity-rich scrubland have steadily been replaced by neat rows of oil palms. Signs hanging on fences say the crop will be used to make SAF.

While many locals living in the district’s towns welcome the jobs and economic boost provided by BBF’s palm plantations, Indigenous people and environmentalists see them as a threat to nature, traditional ways of life and the rainforest.

“If these areas are completely replaced by crops for biofuel production, we will lose unique species, many of which are still little known to science,” said Lucas Ferrante, a researcher from the zoology postgraduate programme at the Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM).

BBF, which announced its plans for the Manaus SAF project back in 2022, makes much of the fact that – in line with Brazil’s strict environmental laws – it only grows oil palm on land that was degraded before 2007, rather than freshly deforested land.

Stressing the company’s green credentials in an interview with Brazilian newspaper Valor Econômico last year, CEO Milton Steagall said the firm – which grows palm on about 75,000 hectares (185,000 acres) in the northern Amazon states of Pará and Roraima – “only cultivates the plant in the areas permitted by law”.

“Our sustainable palm cultivation recovers areas already degraded by deforestation and contributes to keeping the Amazon rainforest standing,” he said.

Illegally cleared land

BBF, which says it is the biggest palm oil producer in Brazil, makes palm-based biodiesel that fuels a network of power stations in the Amazon region, supplying some 140,000 customers with electricity.

The plan to produce SAF from the same feedstock would be its first foray into a new market that is set to take off in the coming years, as more countries – including Brazil – require their aviation sectors to start using greener fuel – read more about SAF here.

But InfoAmazonia’s investigation suggests that sourcing rising amounts of SAF from crops like palm that are grown in tropical forest countries – from Brazil to Malaysia – poses a threat to rainforests that are vital stores of climate-heating carbon.

InfoAmazonia identified the illegally deforested areas being used by BBF in southern parts of Roraima by analysing data from the Earth Index platform, which draws on artificial intelligence and satellite images to determine land use.

The data was then cross-referenced with maps of embargoed areas produced by the government’s Ibama agency. In April this year, the InfoAmazonia team visited the sites and confirmed the existence of the palm crops.

Their analysis found that a total area of 164 hectares (405 acres) close to São João da Baliza had been embargoed by Ibama, meaning the land cannot be used for agriculture.

While the area – roughly equivalent to 250 soccer pitches – represents a small fraction of BBF’s total plantations, the findings highlight the deforestation risks of large-scale oil palm cultivation in the Amazon.

None of the plots are officially registered in BBF’s name – something that is relatively common in Brazil’s land registry – but when InfoAmazonia visited them, the company’s logo could be seen displayed clearly on the fences of each.

Pictures taken with a drone of one of the areas show a field that appears to have been recently planted with palms cutting into a forested area that stretches toward the horizon. A few tall trees dot the newly planted area.

Asked about InfoAmazonia’s findings, BBF said it had never been informed about the issuance of environmental penalties on any of its land in Roraima.o estratégico e retomada do crescimento sustentável de suas operações na região Norte”.

“(The company) has (completed) the environmental licensing processes with the State Foundation for the Environment and Water Resources (FEMARH) in all of its areas, which are necessary for the sustainable cultivation of oil palm in the state of Roraima,” a BBF spokesperson told InfoAmazonia.

Pasture and bananas make way for palm

Palm oil production in Roraima as a whole rose nearly 40 times between 2019 and 2023, according to data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).

Even when palm is planted only on degraded land, the spread of plantations puts “indirect pressure” on forested areas, said Eder Carvalho, chief inspector at Ibama’s Roraima branch.

“Old pasture is replaced by palm, with forested areas in turn being cleared to make way for new pasture and banana cultivation,” he said, explaining a process often referred to in climate and environmental risk assessments as “indirect land use change”, or ILUC.

It is because of the high risk of ILUC linked to palm oil cultivation – and the related carbon dioxide emitted when forests are destroyed – that virgin palm oil is not permitted as a feedstock for SAF in Europe.

Large plantations of a single crop, a practice called monoculture, cause other environmental problems, too, opponents say, taking a heavy toll on biodiversity, depleting water supplies and often involving substantial use of pesticides and other agrochemicals.

In the Amazon, researchers say monoculture also depletes the so-called flying rivers – moist air currents – that carry rain to other parts of Brazil.

“The forest stores a lot of water in the soil, and the trees have deep roots, which lead to evaporation that cools the air, keeping the temperature low,” said climatologist Carlos Nobre, from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), one of the first scientists to study flying rivers.

Green fuel of the future?

Environmental campaigners warn that allowing the use of non-waste vegetable oils like virgin palm oil as a feedstock for SAF would both fuel forest loss and harm the global and local climate in big commodity-producing nations with important rainforest ecosystems such as Brazil, Malaysia and Indonesia.

“We can’t go backwards and return to fuels made from plants, like palm,” said Cian Delaney, a campaign coordinator with the Belgium-based Transport & Environment organisation, adding that no agricultural crop should be used in SAF production.

“This is a fundamental point from an environmental point of view. This cannot open space for the expansion of first-generation crops,” he said.

Due to such concerns, the EU and Britain require SAF to be made from waste products such as used cooking oil (UCO), as they began this year to mandate SAF blending into jet fuel as a way to reduce air travel’s hefty carbon emissions.

But a months-long investigation by Climate Home and its partner The Straits Times has uncovered an opaque global supply chain for UCO that exposes jet fuel providers and their aviation clients to fraud risks and raises doubts about the climate benefits of the sector’s main green hope for the years ahead.

The United States takes a more lenient approach on SAF feedstocks, allowing crop-based SAF derived from corn or sugarcane.

‘Saudi Arabia of SAF’

Brazil, which is set to allow non-waste vegetable oils like palm to be used in SAF production, wants to position itself as a major global player in efforts to decarbonise transport – including flying.

Aviation currently accounts for about 2.5% of global carbon emissions.

The government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has highlighted Brazil’s potential to become a leading producer of feedstocks for SAF, which it has dubbed the “fuel of the future”.

As part of the government’s plans, airlines operating in Brazil will have to meet emissions-cutting targets by using a SAF fuel blend, starting with a 1% emissions reduction in 2027 that will rise to 10% by 2037.

Since BBF unveiled its trailblazing SAF plan, several more such projects have been announced, with tallow – a byproduct of cattle ranching – soy oil and ethanol made from sugarcane among the planned feedstocks. Brazil unveiled $1 billion in public financing last year for SAF projects, and received more than 70 proposals.

Human rights warning

Despite the growing hype around green aviation fuel, BBF’s financial difficulties and the ongoing debt negotiations with creditors have clouded its target to launch SAF production at the 2 billion reais ($390 million) biorefinery this year or in 2026.

Asked whether the refinery was scheduled to launch as planned, the company told InfoAmazonia it “will not be able to comment on new business operations due to the complex debt restructuring process”, adding that BBF aimed to “continue its strategic plan and resume sustainable growth of its operations”.

In its first-quarter report this year, the company told investors it faced “difficulty in obtaining new lines of financing to complete long-term projects”, without directly mentioning the refinery.

The company’s financing troubles began in August 2023, when Brazil’s National Human Rights Council (CNDH) recommended that seven banks – among them state development bank BNDES, state-run Banco do Brasil and Banco da Amazônia – should halt loan deals with the company over suspected violations against Indigenous people and others in Acará and Tomé-Açu in Pará, related to land disputes.

For years, tension between some local communities and BBF has simmered in the Amazon region over land ownership and rights – sometimes erupting into violence. The CNDH’s recommendation to banks came months after state prosecutors sought the arrest of a BBF director and its security chief for offences including torture.

The company denies wrongdoing in the case and says it has “suffered continuous invasions” of its properties in Pará since 2021.

‘No hunting, no fishing’

Back in Roraima, beside a muddy unpaved road outside São João da Baliza, signs reading “Private property” and “Hunting and fishing prohibited” stand in front of a plantation of mature oil palms.

The protected Indigenous Territory (TI) of the WaiWái people lies only about 10 km (six miles) away, but local leader Alexandre Waiwai said community members had no interest in hunting on the palm plantations, preferring to search for animals in the forest beyond.

Standing in his wooden house, the walls decorated with bows and arrows, Waiwai said many people feared that animals grazing on the plantations might ingest agrochemicals – despite BBF’s assurance it does not use them on its palm crops.

“Some animals like boar eat palm fruit. We’re afraid of contamination through the meat we hunt and also our water,” Waiwai said.

Villagers also complain about fires in areas surrounding their territory and smoke billowing out of the chimneys of BBF’s industrial plant. Community health worker Vanilda Waiwai said locals report high levels of respiratory problems.

The challenges facing BBF could hold lessons for other firms hoping to launch SAF projects in Brazil.

Guedes, from the E+ Energy Transition Institute, said Brazilian SAF producers expect human rights to be key parameters for entering international markets, adding that the country’s recently created national SAF programme is likely to take into account rights as well as biodiversity safeguards.

“We know we’ll have to present our credentials on human rights. There’s a concern in general (about human rights impacts) and Brazil is aware of that concern,” he said.

SAF accounted for just 0.3% of global jet fuel production in 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which has called the take-up rate “disappointing”.
Currently, SAF is between two and seven times more expensive than traditional jet fuel.
Meanwhile, the price of fossil fuel-based jet fuel is kept artificially low due to wide-ranging tax exemptions.
The US has opted for direct subsidies and tax credits – rather than mandates – to stimulate SAF production.","The world’s appetite for flying keeps on growing, fuelling concerns about how to shrink the carbon footprint of air travel – today the cause of about 2.5% of all energy-related emissions.

While that’s a relatively small share of global emissions, it looks set to increase in the decades to come as other sectors, such as road transport, cut their emissions by switching to electric – still a distant technological prospect for commercial aircraft. Increasing demand for air travel will also play a role.

For the airline industry and many governments across the world, the solution is so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which can cut emissions by between 50% and nearly 100%, depending on how it is made, without requiring aircraft modifications.

How is SAF made?

SAF can be made from a variety of raw materials, or feedstocks, using different techniques, but today virtually all of it is made using the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process. This refining technique involves stripping oxygen from the fat molecules of natural oils and fats and replacing it with hydrogen. HEFA fuel has various uses, including in aviation.

Used cooking oil (UCO) is currently the most common feedstock for SAF, especially in Europe where policies promote its use as a recycled waste product that does not compete for land with food production or carry a high risk for deforestation, in contrast to virgin oils derived from soybeans or palm.

Other countries are prioritising feedstocks that can be easily sourced locally, such as soy in the United States or palm oil in Brazil. The two agricultural powerhouses are also expected to produce large quantities of SAF by converting ethanol made from corn or sugarcane – another kind of drop-in fuel known as alcohol-to-jet.

SAF can also be made without crops or organic waste. Synthetic fuels – known as e-SAF or power-to-liquid SAF – are made from two gases: green hydrogen, generated from renewable electricity, and carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere or industrial processes. E-SAF can reduce emissions by up to 90% compared to fossil fuel-based jet fuels, but it remains prohibitively expensive to manufacture.

How much SAF are airlines using?

SAF accounted for just 0.3% of global jet fuel production in 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which has called the take-up rate “disappointing”. The industry body estimates SAF will reach 0.7% in 2025.

Cost is the main reason for the slow rollout. Currently, SAF is between two and seven times more expensive than traditional jet fuel. That’s primarily down to the limited availability of feedstocks like UCO and challenges in making production more cost-efficient by scaling it up. Meanwhile, the price of fossil fuel-based jet fuel is kept artificially low due to wide-ranging tax exemptions.

Some countries are trying to expand the market for cleaner aviation fuels by offering financial incentives and making SAF use compulsory.

The European Union and the UK introduced the world’s first SAF mandates in January 2025, requiring fuel suppliers to blend at least 2% SAF with conventional kerosene. The blending requirement will gradually increase to reach 32% in the EU and 22% in the UK by 2040.

SAF mandates are also coming into force over the next few years in Singapore and Brazil, and other major aviation hubs such as Japan and China plan to introduce targets.

The US has opted for direct subsidies and tax credits – rather than mandates – to stimulate SAF production.

Will SAF lead to net-zero air travel?

Existing and advanced-stage SAF projects will meet just 2%-4% of jet fuel demand by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), far short of what is needed to put the sector on track to meet its goal of reaching net zero by 2050.

Airlines have been sounding the alarm about scant supplies and demanding policies to incentivise production. In March, the CEOs of Ryanair, International Airline Group (IAG), Lufthansa and Air France-KLM said the EU’s 6% SAF requirement for 2030 would be impossible to meet because of the high cost and scarcity of the fuel.

Luis Gallego, CEO of IAG, the parent company of British Airways and Iberia, called for an urgent EU aviation strategy “to have SAF at competitive prices”, Reuters reported. Without that, he said, “the only realistic solution is to move the 2030 SAF mandate to the right”.

The EU responded at the time by saying its SAF targets were “realistic and feasible”.

Airlines and fuel producers have also been pressing for more government financial support to expand the production of e-SAF and lower the cost.

Is SAF really a sustainable and climate-friendly solution?

Governments and the International Civil Aviation Organization require certification to prove the sustainability of any given batch of SAF, and the raw materials used to make it.

The world’s leading certification system is the industry-led ISCC (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification), which issues certificates used by EU regulators to prove the origin and sustainability of SAF produced and used in the bloc.

Approved third-party auditors inspect SAF producers and traders of raw materials around the world, and – if standards are met on feedstock origins and carbon savings – they receive the ISCC’s stamp of approval.

But guaranteeing the sustainability of feedstocks throughout complex supply chains is challenging.

In the case of UCO, suppliers at the point of origin such as restaurants and individuals are required to fill out a self-declaration form. The system relies on their honest declaration that their product is actually waste oil, used repeatedly and no longer suitable for cooking.

The ISCC verification system has been criticised by European industry members and national regulators for failing to catch cases of fraud in biodiesel supplies. In 2024, the ISCC conducted 79 “integrity assessments” – around two-thirds targeting Asia-based suppliers – which independently monitored the work of auditors. A third of the analysed cases showed violations of certification requirements, leading to the withdrawal of 11 certificates.

Is SAF making air travel more expensive?

With airlines currently paying a significant premium to add SAF to their airport fuel supplies, some have started to pass the extra cost onto passengers.

Air France-KLM and Lufthansa have added mandatory SAF levies to tickets, with the German flag carrier charging up to 72 euros ($82) per flight depending on the route and fare.

In Singapore, which wants to become a regional SAF hub, travellers flying out of the country will pay a SAF levy from 2026, when all departing flights will be required to carry 1% SAF. Preliminary estimates from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore suggest that economy-class passengers may incur an extra S$3 ($2.30) levy for short-haul flights and S$16 ($12.40) for long-haul flights.

A growing number of airlines also offer customers the option to pay a voluntary SAF charge to help offset the carbon footprint of their journey. British Airways, for example, encourages members of its loyalty programme to make voluntary contributions, enabling them to pay with and earn points.

Low-cost Spanish airline Vueling, also owned by IAG, offers passengers the chance to make a contribution equivalent to the cost of 2% of the total fuel needed to reach their destination to be provided in the form of SAF – a contribution it matches.",https://infoamazonia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DJI_20250413160506_0133_D.jpg,N,,2025-06-18 16:06:11.031177

Backers claim that SAF, when derived from waste products such as used cooking oil (UCO), can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 80%.

This cross-border investigation by Climate Home News, InfoAmazonia and The Straits Times started with the idea to explore whether the EU’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) targets could be met amid supply shortages, whether deforestation and land conflicts appeared linked to the soybean supply chains for European SAFs, and whether there was any potential fraud to be detected in the supply chain for used cooking oil in Southeast Asia, another SAFs feedstock.

Eventually the main part of the story came to focus on the UCO trade between Malaysia, the world’s second-biggest palm oil producer, and Spain, Europe’s largest aviation market and home to one of its SAF pioneers, Repsol. Barely used and virgin palm oil – not permitted under European Union rules because of its links to rainforest loss – is being passed off as UCO, suppliers in Malaysia told journalists.

After being denied access to comprehensive trade data by EU regulators and Repsol, the team was able to piece together the Spanish energy giant’s supply chain in alternative ways: the reporters submitted FOI requests, obtained private commercial trade data and attended UCO collection events in person in Malaysia to reveal for the first time a complete picture of Repsol’s SAF supply. The journalists have been able to trace the full supply chain of Repsol from its new SAF refinery in Cartagena to the Malaysian city of Melaka.

While UCO struggles with fraud allegations in Asia, InfoAmazonia in Brazil uncovered the challenges of resorting to crop-based SAF – allowed in some parts of the world due to the lack of harmonised green standards. The journalists found that the palm oil producer behind a planned biorefinery in the Amazon region - billed as Brazil’s first SAF project - is growing the crop on land areas subject to sanctions by the national environment agency over illegal deforestation, and is struggling financially after rights abuse allegations.

This investigation compiles a global picture of the SAF industry and the obstacles it faces in meeting rising demand with environmental integrity as more countries seek to cut aviation emissions while increasing air travel. Fuel producers will need to address these challenges fast, as they are required to supply airports across Europe with increasing amounts of SAF from this year under new EU and UK rules, with other parts of the world also planning to introduce mandates.

Climate strategy and emissions reduction

FedEx continues to advance its decarbonisation strategy across Scope 1, 2 and selected Scope 3 emissions categories.

In FY24, FedEx achieved a 6.1% year-on-year reduction in Scope 1 emissions, with aviation-related Scope 1 emissions from jet fuel decreasing by 4.9% thanks to efficiency upgrades and fleet modernisation efforts.

The company has achieved a 31% reduction in aviation emissions intensity since 2005 and is targeting a 40% reduction by 2034.

Total Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity has fallen to 179.50 metric tons of CO₂ equivalent per million USD in revenue, representing a 58% decrease from FY09, even as daily package volumes increased by an average of 121%.

Fuel conservation and aircraft modernisation saved the company approximately 140 million gallons of jet fuel and an estimated US$400m in FY24 alone.

FedEx has committed to procuring 30% of its jet fuel from sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blends by 2030.

“As the world’s preeminent express transportation company, our initial US deployment of this fuel advances our sustainability goals and bolsters the aviation industry’s efforts to source and use more SAF,” says Richard Smith, Chief Operating Officer, International, and CEO, Airline, FedEx.

“While we know further growth of the SAF market is needed, alongside other innovations, we are proud to celebrate this milestone with our world-class air network.”

However, less than 1% of global jet fuel produced in 2024 was SAF, which underlines the challenges ahead.

To offset emissions that cannot be mitigated through technology, FedEx has invested US$100m in the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture.

Research includes the development of durable carbon removal methods such as enhanced weathering using basalt, which reduces soil acidity and improves crop yield while sequestering CO₂.

FedEx is also expanding its emissions reporting, including Scope 3 Categories 3, 4 and 6, and has committed to science-based targets pending validation.

While the original goal of a 50% improvement by 2025 is now unlikely to be met due to operational restructuring under Network 2.0, the company is progressing toward full fleet electrification.

More than 8,000 electric vehicles were in service in FY24, including e-cargo bicycles and tricycles in markets such as Canada, the UK and Taiwan.

Following successful pilots, FedEx has ordered 150 Shyft Group Blue Arc trucks with larger capacity to better match operational needs.

The company aims to have 50% of all PUD vehicle purchases be electric by 2025 and 100% by 2030, with the entire PUD fleet – including contracted vehicles – fully electric by 2040.

FedEx is addressing the associated infrastructure needs by installing new EV chargers and working with utilities and regulators to build out grid capacity.

It has supported RMI’s GridUp tool with more than US$2.5m to help utilities forecast grid demand from transport electrification.

“Procuring SAF is an important component of our aviation emissions-reduction strategy in the coming years and we are pleased to have executed a deal with Neste to begin using this fuel in our air operations,” says Karen Blanks Ellis, Chief Sustainability Officer and Vice President of Environmental Affairs, FedEx.

“Our aviation network represents the largest amount of FedEx fuel use globally and, as a result, is our biggest opportunity to drive down emissions.

“As we work toward our goal of carbon-neural operations by 2040, we need the SAF market to continue to grow to meet industry demand.”

Facility energy use accounts for around 6% of FedEx’s total emissions.

FedEx aims to source 100% of its facility electricity from renewable sources by 2040, with interim targets of 500 GWh by 2028 and 1,300 GWh by 2033.

In FY24, it generated more than 31 GWh from solar at 34 global sites and made contracts to install 8 MW of new capacity in FY25.

Total energy intensity declined to 3.19 terajoules per million USD revenue.

A project to replace plastic packaging bags with reusable mesh bags at FedEx Ground hubs saved US$20.4m and prevented 50 million plastic bags from going to landfill.

Dive Brief:

Otto Aviation is investing more than $430 million to establish an advanced manufacturing and production facility at Cecil Airport in Jacksonville, Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Monday at the 55th International Paris Air Show.

The project entails upgrading an existing hangar to establish initial operations, building an 850,000-square-foot factory and creating more than 389 jobs with an average salary of $90,388, according to a Florida Commerce press release.

The new facility will also serve as the primary final assembly site for Otto Aviation’s fuel-efficient Phantom 3500 aircraft, with production of its flight test vehicles slated to begin in 2026, according to the aerospace startup’s press release.

Dive Insight:

Otto Aviation aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions with the Phantom 3500, set to enter service around 2030, according to the company’s press release on Tuesday.

The jet’s release date will be two decades ahead of the aviation industry’s goal to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which the International Civil Aviation Organization adopted in 2022. The United Nations agency embraced the target in support of the Paris Agreement's goal tolimit the global average temperature increase to well below 2 degrees Celsius, or 35.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

Otto’s plane has an artificial intelligence-supported clean sheet design and high-speed airflow construction that makes the Phantom 3500 lightweight and burns 60% less fuel than similar-sized jets, according to the press release. The design enables the plane to travel farther on less fuel and reduces emissions by 90% when combined with sustainable aviation fuel.

“This new facility will become more than a manufacturing site — it’s the launchpad for the future of sustainable aviation,” CEO Paul Touw said in a June 16 statement.

Otto Aviation’s new facility will occupy 80 to 100 acres of land at Cecil Airport, expanding the company’s ability to service the commercial and defense markets while giving it room for potential growth.

The company also plans to move its headquarters from Fort Worth, Texas, to Jacksonville, according to the press release.

Jacksonville’s incentives were a “material factor” in choosing the new plant’s location, according to city council documents. The Jacksonville Aviation Authority approved a $34.9 million incentive package, and the city of Jacksonville approved an up to $20 million tax grant to support the startup’s investment.

Additionally, Florida state officials approved over $430 million in corporate income tax credits and performance incentive grants, the company said in the release.

“Jacksonville stood out as a city that shares our long-term vision: pushing boundaries in aerospace innovation while creating high-quality jobs and meaningful impact,” Touw said in a statement.

Florida is aiming to become “The Aerospace State,” according to a Florida Commerce press release on Tuesday. Last month, DeSantis announced that Boeing supplier Williams International is investing more than $1 billion to establish a gas-powered turbine engine manufacturing site in Okaloosa County.

The Florida governor also signed legislation earlier this week to draw more aerospace companies, according to the state’s Commerce Department. One new law will establish a plan to attract the advanced air mobility sector and increase spending on the state’s spaceports to support industry growth.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/PqjKa3UChN-RinbBO4ZExOuNT8c0-m1XQw5_jqxpSHI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9waGFudG9tLWNsb3Vkcy5wbmc=.webp,N,,2025-06-18 13:08:49.138919

The investments will promote the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and are part of Boeing’s Industrial and Technological Benefits (ITB) commitment to Canada for its selection of Boeing’s P-8A Poseidon to fulfill its long-range, multi-mission aircraft role.

The investments will support two projects:

$10 million CAD for Project Avance

A joint venture between Bioenergie AECN and Alder Renewables in Port Cartier, Quebec, to convert wood residuals from existing sawmills into a low-carbon intermediate “biocrude” that can be converted into SAF. Project Avance is forecasted to enable future projects in Quebec to produce 10 million gallons (approximately 37,854,000 liters) of unblended SAF annually.

$7.48 million CAD for Dimensional Energy

The power-to-liquid technology provider will scope scaled development of its pioneering carbon utilization project to convert industrial CO2 emissions into synthetic aviation fuel production. This study will support future projects in North America to convert 500,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions to produce more than 40 million gallons (approximately 151,416,000 liters) of SAF annually.

“This significant investment in SAF production demonstrates our commitment to scaling sustainable aviation fuel and to our work in Canada, where we have driven innovation for over a century,” said Al Meinzinger, president, Boeing Canada. “With 2,000 employees across Canada, Boeing is committed to supporting Canada’s aerospace industry and domestic productivity and advancing exciting new energy innovations.”

“Our proprietary Alder Renewable Crude (ARC) product has enormous potential to fast-track the production of SAF in Canada,” said Darren Fuller, Chief Commercial Officer of Alder Renewables. “The support of Boeing and local government leaders in Quebec is supercharging our commitment to securing a low carbon future for the aviation sector. Close collaboration with our industry partners — Boeing and Bioenergie AECN — coupled with government support is essential to get to the next phase. We’re ready to play our part.”

“Making high performance hydrocarbons is an innovative use for carbon dioxide that turns unwanted waste into valuable fuels and products,” said Jason Salfi, CEO of Dimensional Energy. “This investment from Boeing provides essential predevelopment capital to catalyze projects and scale our proven power-to-liquid technology to market now.”

“Boeing’s investments in Quebec and British Columbia highlight Canada’s position as a strategic partner of choice in sustainable aviation and will generate high-value jobs and economic growth,” said the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions. “The Government of Canada is committed to reducing aviation emissions and reinforcing Canada’s position as a global leader in aerospace innovation.”

The two SAF projects are part of Boeing’s over $280 million CAD investment in Canadian Clean Technology projects through the P-8 ITB program. Boeing investments will advance technologies that have the potential to unlock vast renewable resources and accelerate industries producing low-carbon fuels to meet the rising global demand. SAF has the potential today to reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% over the fuel’s lifecycle and offers the fastest route to decarbonization in the aviation sector.

The Government of Canada announced its decision to acquire the P-8A Poseidon aircraft in November 2023 as part of the Canadian Multi-Mission Aircraft (CMMA) project. These Boeing CMMA ITB investments build on more than $2 billion in P-8 contracts with Canadian companies to date, contributing to economic growth across the country.

SABA supports and provides momentum to existing airline-company agreements, while driving investment and production of SAF and furthering technological innovation in the field of sustainable aviation.","As part of Deloitte’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions as part of WorldClimate, Deloitte has entered into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) agreements with several US airlines—Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines—which will cover a portion of Deloitte’s business travel. Following pilot transactions with multiple airlines, we began exploring transactions with fuel producers, upstream in the value chain, including Shell Aviation and World Energy, to further demonstrate our commitment to decarbonizing aviation. Through our SAF collaborations to date, we have contracted to avoid the emissions from approximately 15,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide (equivalent to approximately 48,000 passengers flying one way from New York City to Los Angeles).

For more information, the initial SAF agreements between:

Alaska Airlines and Deloitte reduce the life cycle emissions of their business travel by approximately 1,050 metric tons of carbon dioxide.

American Airlines and Deloitte reduce life cycle emissions from aviation by approximately 3,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide.

Delta Air Lines and Deloitte reduce life cycle emissions from aviation by approximately 1,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide.

JetBlue and Deloitte are part of JetBlue’s “Sustainable Travel Partner” program. Deloitte is an inaugural participant in JetBlue’s program helping business travel customers understand and reduce their business travel emissions to meet their own organization sustainability targets.

Southwest Airlines and Deloitte are supporting and advancing sustainability initiatives within their corporate travel portfolios.

United Airlines and Deloitte are part of United's new Eco-Skies AllianceSM program, the largest SAF program to date. As an inaugural participant, Deloitte will be one of several Eco-Skies Alliance leaders that will work with United to collectively purchase emissions reductions from 3.4 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel this year.

SAF is made from renewable waste materials, such as used cooking oil. Unlike fossil fuels which release additional carbon, SAF recycles CO2 emissions that were emitted previously and subsequently absorbed from the atmosphere during biomass production.1 Sustainable aviation fuel reduces the life cycle carbon emissions from airline fuel by up to 80% when used in pure form, compared to fossil jet fuel. Crucially, it's compatible with existing airplanes and aviation fueling infrastructure.2

These collaborations are a critical early step for the future of sustainable business travel—uniting the goals of a large business organization seeking to reduce their carbon footprint with US airlines that already use SAF in their daily operations, as well as with fuel producers upstream in the value chain that are shifting towards lower-carbon fuels. The investment in SAF is one way for Deloitte to actually avoid generating carbon emissions within our own value chain, as opposed to solely retroactively purchasing carbon offsets for emissions already generated.

The SAF certificate concept, initially developed by the World Economic Forum's Clean Skies for Tomorrow initiative, sets out to increase sustainable fuel production by aligning ambitious corporate sustainability goals with the aviation industry. Businesses that buy into SAF agreements pay a green premium on this investment in cleaner fuel technologies, as opposed to the initial cost burden being placed on either consumers or producers. Through this agreement, Deloitte takes an important step toward our goal of reducing business travel emissions by 50% per FTE by 2030.

The regular and widespread use of SAF is expected to be pivotal in reducing aviation emissions. That being said, it is a new market solution and not yet available at the scale or price needed to be the primary source of fuel for US airlines. Through these initial SAF agreements, Deloitte is leading efforts to create more market demand for SAF, with the goal of increasing availability and affordability and further SAF development. A cost-effective business model and an increased supply of SAF will allow us to meet our own sustainability goals and help accelerate the transition to lower-carbon air travel. To this end, Deloitte is also one of the founding members of the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA), launched by RMI and the Environmental Defense Fund. SABA supports and provides momentum to existing airline-company agreements, while driving investment and production of SAF and furthering technological innovation in the field of sustainable aviation.

Businesses have an opportunity to play a key role in addressing climate change by redesigning day-to-day experiences. Regardless of the evolution of hybrid workplaces and the future of business travel, joint initiatives like these help Deloitte continue to serve our clients in a way that reflects our commitment to sustainability.

In November 2024, the Scottish Government published its draft Grangemouth Just Transition Plan for consultation. There, we outlined both the historic and critical role that Grangemouth has played in shaping Scotland’s industrial heritage, and the important role we want it to have in shaping our net-zero future. For over a century, the industrial cluster has been a source of high value employment and the output from businesses, driven by dedicated and highly skilled workers, has contributed hugely to Scotland’s economy.

However, the industrial cluster now faces a time of unparalleled change. This has manifested prominently in the cessation of refining at Grangemouth - a facility which has played an important role in maintaining Scotland’s energy security for decades. For many, this has been an uncertain time and nowhere has this been felt more acutely than by those who live and work at Grangemouth.

Beyond the refinery’s closure, many of the challenges outlined in our draft plan, remain the backdrop to operations at Grangemouth, presenting a significant risk to securing a sustainable, low carbon future for the site.

However, the Scottish Government remains steadfast in its commitment to Grangemouth’s future, it’s transition to net-zero and its skilled and dedicated workers. We recognise the imperative for tangible and effective actions now, and have taken decisive steps to maximise our support, as far as possible. This includes;

Our £25 million Grangemouth Just Transition Fund to support industry, the workforce and community throughout this period of transition. This supplements the £7.8 million in our budget for 2025-26, providing the Just Transition Plan with up to £33 million from the Scottish Government immediately, to support delivery this year.

Our initial and ongoing support for Project Willow has rapidly considered and identified a number of alternative developments for the existing Refinery site.

A targeted skills intervention for Petroineos workers facing redundancy at the Grangemouth refinery and Finnart Terminal to support the transition of impacted workers through the job market into in-demand industries.

Signing of the Falkirk and Grangemouth Growth Deal, that includes development of Grangemouth Sustainable Manufacturing Campus, the Greener Grangemouth Programme and a £4m Skills Transition Centre.

£2.8 million this year of a total funding commitment of £5 million to support INEOS’ Grangemouth’s Fuel Switching Net Zero Project, Supporting the business to switch their power source from natural gas to hydrogen, initially supported by the construction of a blue hydrogen plant on site.

However, we cannot do this alone – we rely on a broad range of partners in the public sector, business and the community to work with us to realise Grangemouth’s potential. The UK Government must commit to playing its part and stand by the community and workers at Grangemouth.

We desperately need the UK Government to commence positive changes to existing policy that enable the deployment of future commodities like Sustainable Aviation Fuel production in Scotland.

Key to the successful deployment of the Project Willow technologies is certainty regarding the future of Acorn/ the Scottish Cluster on which we continue to call on the UK Government to confirm a final decision, including a full funding package and timeline.

Project Willow has showcased the scale, complexity and significant effort that will continue to be required across all partners to ensure a long-term future for industrial manufacturing at Grangemouth, that is both climate compatible and commercially viable. But it has also highlighted the clear opportunities there too.

This plan, now finalised following recent revisions and consultation analysis, will act as the framework for all activity that supports Grangemouth’s transition– utilising agreed outcomes that span the interests of community, workers and wider business. Much work lies ahead, for industry, Governments and wider partners across the Grangemouth Future Industry Board, however we can build on the progress made over recent months.

We remain incredibly grateful to each and every person who has provided the ongoing commitment of time and knowledge taken to reach this point.

The time is now for focused action.",https://www.gov.scot/assets/images/logos/SGLogo1200x630.png,N,,2025-06-18 13:09:07.552006

The announcement was made during the 2025 Paris Air Show, highlighting East Africa’s growing commitment to aviation sustainability.

This move positions Safarilink as one of the first African operators to embrace hybrid-electric regional aviation, aligning with global efforts to decarbonize air travel. The ERA (Electric Regional Aircraft) is designed to deliver significantly lower emissions while cutting operational costs—a critical factor for airlines serving environmentally sensitive areas like Kenya’s world-renowned national parks.

Reinventing Regional Aviation

The 19-seater ERA aircraft is a state-of-the-art solution equipped with eight Safran-developed ENGINeUS electric motors and two Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)-compatible turbo-generators, enabling flexible hybrid or fully electric flight phases. With a range of up to 900 nautical miles (1,666 km), ERA is designed to handle both passenger and cargo operations.

The hybrid-electric technology is expected to reduce CO₂ emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional regional aircraft, making it one of the most eco-efficient aircraft in its class. ERA’s pressurized cabin (1.88m high) offers unmatched passenger comfort for its size, while its ability to operate from short and unpaved runways ensures suitability for the remote bush strips typical of East Africa’s safari routes.

“We are delighted to support Safarilink in their transition towards low-carbon aircraft,” said Jérémy Caussade, President and co-founder of AURA AERO.

“With ERA, they will take full advantage of hybrid-electric technology in terms of decarbonization, noise reduction, and cost-efficiency, while upgrading to an innovative, new-generation plane.”

A Major Step for African Aviation Sustainability

Safarilink’s CEO Alex Avedi confirmed that sustainability has become central to the airline’s fleet renewal plans:

“One of our key strategic priorities is to contribute to the decarbonization of aviation by upgrading our fleet to next-generation, environmentally sustainable aircraft. In ERA, we have identified a cutting-edge, eco-efficient solution, and we are looking forward to operating this state-of-the-art plane.”

With this agreement, Safarilink is positioning itself as a pioneer for sustainable safari travel, aligning its brand with both eco-conscious tourism trends and Kenya’s broader environmental policies, including commitments under the Paris Agreement and national decarbonization frameworks.

Regional Impact: Tourism, Trade, and Sustainability

Operating since 2004, Safarilink has become a crucial connector to Kenya’s most sought-after safari destinations such as Maasai Mara, Amboseli, Samburu, and even cross-border connections into northern Tanzania. The new hybrid-electric aircraft will play a key role in reducing the carbon footprint of safari tourism, a sector increasingly under scrutiny for its environmental impacts.

Additionally, ERA’s flexibility for cargo operations positions Safarilink to support regional trade in East Africa, particularly serving remote communities with humanitarian aid, medical supplies, and logistics support in addition to tourism.

A Growing Order Book for AURA AERO

With this order, AURA AERO’s ERA program has now surpassed 650 aircraft on its orderbook, valued at over $10.5 billion.

Note to Editors:

Hydrogen has the potential to play a crucial role in decarbonising aviation in the long term, and to bring a revolution in air transport comparable to that of electric vehicles in the automotive sector.

To that aim, Airbus’ ambition is to bring a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft to market. The ZEROe project was launched in 2020 to explore the feasibility of two primary hydrogen propulsion technologies: hydrogen combustion and hydrogen fuel cells.

In March 2025, during the Airbus Summit, Airbus announced that it was focusing efforts on a fuel cell fully-electric propulsion system. The results of the fuel cell prototype and powertrain testing, as well as research into complementary technology such as cryogenics, supported the viability of this technology.

More information on the ZEROe hydrogen-powered aircraft.

Beyond the aircraft technologies, Airbus will continue to foster the emergence of a hydrogen aviation economy and the associated regulatory framework, which are also critical enablers to the advent of hydrogen-powered flight at scale.

MTU Aero Engines has been making continuous good progress with regard to a fuel cell-related revolutionary propulsion system. It has reached some important milestones over the past months: The design for the company’s Flying Fuel Cell has been nailed down, stack manufacturing for the demonstrator has started, the eMoSys electric motor was successfully tested for the first time, and the first test cell went into operation in Munich.

Beyond this, MTU Aero Engines is leading the Clean Aviation technology project HEROPS (Hydrogen-Electric Zero Emission Propulsion System). Launched in early 2024, HEROPS aims to develop innovative technologies for a climate-neutral, hydrogen-powered electric powertrain based on MTU’s Flying Fuel Cell.

By leveraging strategic partnerships with aerospace giants and aggressively expanding production capacity, the French energy giant is not only meeting regulatory mandates but also laying the groundwork for long-term market dominance. Here's why investors should take note.

Strategic Partnerships: Building a Decarbonization Ecosystem

TotalEnergies' leadership begins with its ability to align with industry leaders, ensuring its SAF solutions are both technologically viable and commercially scalable. A standout partnership is its 2024 collaboration with Airbus, which commits TotalEnergies to supply over half of Airbus's SAF needs in Europe. This deal isn't just about volume; it includes a joint R&D program to validate high-blend SAF (over 50%) and even 100% SAF formulations. Such collaboration addresses a critical barrier to SAF adoption: proving that existing aircraft systems can safely handle higher blends without costly retrofits.

The company's partnership with Safran since 2021 further underscores its technical prowess. Together, they developed a SAF blend that successfully powered a military helicopter flight in 2023—a milestone demonstrating SAF's feasibility in high-performance aviation. These alliances not only validate TotalEnergies' fuel quality but also integrate it into the core operations of companies shaping the future of air travel.

Capacity Expansion: Scaling Production to Meet Demand

While partnerships secure demand, TotalEnergies' true edge lies in its aggressive expansion of production capacity. The company has invested over €500 million in its Grandpuits Biorefinery, which will produce 230,000 tons of SAF annually by 2026—a significant leap from its current output. This facility, along with others like the La Mède Biorefinery (15,000 tons/year) and the Normandy Refinery (160,000 tons/year by 2025), forms a production network capable of delivering over 500,000 tons annually by 2028. This scale not only exceeds the EU's 2030 mandate of 6% SAF blending but also positions TotalEnergies to supply over 10% of European jet fuel demand with SAF by that date.

The Antwerp Refinery (80,000 tons/year by 2025) and the planned Leuna Refinery (50,000 tons/year by 2026) further solidify its European footprint. Crucially, these expansions utilize coprocessing—a method of blending biomass with conventional feedstocks in existing refineries—thereby reducing capital costs and accelerating timelines.

Supply Contracts and Market Penetration

TotalEnergies' production ambitions are matched by its commercial commitments. Its 10-year deal with Air France-KLM to supply 1.5 million tons of SAF—one of the largest such contracts globally—ensures steady demand. Similarly, agreements with Volotea and airport networks in France (e.g., Bordeaux, Toulouse) demonstrate its ability to integrate SAF into routine operations. These partnerships not only secure revenue streams but also build brand credibility as airlines and governments prioritize green credentials.

R&D and Innovation: Addressing Feedstock Challenges

Despite its progress, SAF faces hurdles like limited feedstock availability and high costs. TotalEnergies is tackling these through its Solaize research center, which focuses on sustainable biomass sources such as algae and agricultural waste. By diversifying feedstocks, the company aims to reduce reliance on food-based materials and lower production costs—a critical step for mass adoption.

Investment Considerations: Risks and Rewards

TotalEnergies' strategic moves present compelling opportunities for investors, but risks remain. Key concerns include:

- Feedstock Supply: Competition for sustainable biomass could strain costs.

- Regulatory Shifts: While the EU's mandates are clear, global adoption remains uneven.

- Competition: Rivals like Shell and bp are also expanding SAF capacity, though TotalEnergies' current scale and partnerships give it an edge.

Despite these risks, TotalEnergies' proactive approach has already driven investor confidence. Its stock has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past five years, reflecting market optimism about its green transition. With a robust pipeline of projects and partnerships, TotalEnergies is well-positioned to capitalize on the $24 billion SAF market expected by 2030, according to industry estimates.

Conclusion: A Long-Term Play on Decarbonization

TotalEnergies' leadership in SAF is not merely about compliance—it's about redefining the energy landscape. By marrying cutting-edge partnerships with scalable production, the company is turning decarbonization from a distant goal into a tangible reality. For investors seeking exposure to the clean energy transition, TotalEnergies offers a compelling mix of growth, diversification, and strategic foresight. As aviation's reliance on fossil fuels wanes, TotalEnergies is soaring to claim its place at the forefront of the new era.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-1adb7c9fcd020002.png,N,,2025-06-18 11:06:40.269620

World’s largest banks committed $869B to fund fossil fuel companies

A recent report shows that in 2024, a total of $869B was committed by the world’s largest banks, with the money going towards companies that deal with coal, oil and gas. It was found that two-thirds of the world’s largest 65 banks had increased their financial support for fossil fuel companies by $162B from 2023 to 2024. Scientists warn that absolutely no new fossil fuel projects can begin if dangerous climate impacts are to be avoided, considering the disasters caused by global heating and record-breaking temperatures. Despite world leaders committing to the Paris agreement, banks have continued to fund fossil fuel projects, with $7.9T going towards fossil fuel activities since the deal. Amid recent political tensions, many banks, including the world’s top financial firms, have either watered down or entirely forgone their emission-reduction efforts, exacerbating the current climate crisis.

📊 Insight: Despite ongoing climate commitments, major banks have increased fossil fuel financing, underscoring the need for more consistent alignment between financial decisions and climate goals, which can be facilitated using ESG solutions.

UK’s tighter immigration rules may affect net zero target efforts

A report warns that the recent rule amendments announced in the UK government’s immigration white paper may put the country’s net-zero mission at risk by causing labour shortages. The Labour Party’s white paper released last month includes plans to raise minimum qualifications, and the Centre for European Reform (CER) calculates that more than half – 260,000 out of 465,000 – of the foreign-born workers doing “green jobs” in the UK would not have been allowed into the country based on these new rules. Under the rules of this new visa, the construction industry may become understaffed, which poses challenges to the government’s target of decarbonising buildings and building 1.5M homes by the end of the parliament. Experts state that a lower net migration rate may not only result in labour shortages, but the independent Office for Budget Responsibility may need to downgrade its growth forecast.

Sources predict that U.S.A. may object to green jet fuel recommendation at UN aviation council

Sources state that the U.S.A. is expected to object to a recommendation at the UN aviation agency council, as Washington says it unfairly favours Brazilian corn farmers over American producers for the development of green jet fuel. Global carriers that aim for net zero emissions by 2050 are being pressed to make a switch from kerosene to cleaner, but pricier material alternatives such as municipal waste, or cooking oil. Currently, global sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) accounts for less than 1% of the industry’s total jet fuel usage, and the International Air Transport Association projects the long-term cost of the aviation sector’s green transition to be $4.7T. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) technical panel made recommendations in March which were objected to by the U.S. State Department, but said recommendation will be under review by the ICAO’s 36-member council before the global agency’s triennial assembly this coming autumn.

📊 Insight: As the need for sustainable development grows, cleaner fuel alternatives should enter expanding markets. However, political interference with certain decisions regarding environmental protection may delay and undermine people’s confidence in sustainable efforts.
