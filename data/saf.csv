The massive budget bill contains a slew of provisions normally included in a farm bill.
The budget bill includes high statutory reference prices for all commodity program crops, though the amounts vary from crop to crop.
Funding for SNAP is typically a part of the farm bill.
House Ag Committee Ranking Member Angie Craig, D-Minn., said those cuts could also potentially torpedo future farm bill negotiations.","It’s technically not a farm bill, but it will likely impact agriculture more than any other legislation. That is the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law July 4. The massive budget bill contains a slew of provisions normally included in a farm bill.

Chief among those are updates to the commodity title programs through 2031. Those changes will be implemented retroactively to the 2025 commodity year. Notably, farmers will not have to choose between Price Loss Coverage and Agricultural Risk Coverage this year. Instead, farmers will automatically receive payments for the higher of PLC or ARC at the county level. Beginning in crop year 2026, farmers will once again need to choose which program they wish to receive.

The budget bill includes high statutory reference prices for all commodity program crops, though the amounts vary from crop to crop. For example, the corn reference price increases 11% to $4.10 per bushel, while the soybean level increases about 19% to $10 per bushel.

“At a time of great uncertainty for the agriculture economy, the support of Congress to enhance key programs and vital domestic markets for our farmers is critical,” said Caleb Ragland, American Soybean Association president, following the bill’s passage in the House and Senate.

Ragland said ASA was pleased by revisions to the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, as well as additional funding for research and market expansion. Out of the $65.6 billion allocated to agriculture in the bill, more than $59 billion will go toward commodity programs and crop insurance. An additional $2.1 billion and $1.6 billion will support agriculture trade and research programs, respectively.

The $5.98 billion allocated to crop insurance will increase premium support by 3% to 5% across all coverage levels. Farmers enrolled in ARC will also be able to enroll in the Supplemental Coverage Option. Previously, only those enrolled in PLC were able to do so.

Beginning farmers and ranchers will now be eligible for additional premium support of up to 10 years. Before, they could only receive support for five.

Concern over nutrition cuts

Much of the additional ag funding was procured by cutting about $186 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which was fiercely opposed by Democrats. Funding for SNAP is typically a part of the farm bill. Opponents of the cuts say this will cause millions of families to go hungry.

According to the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, up to 5.3 million families could lose benefits or see them reduced. House Ag Committee Ranking Member Angie Craig, D-Minn., said those cuts could also potentially torpedo future farm bill negotiations.

While much of the major spending normally in the farm bill is included in the new law, the legislation only covers certain permanently funded government programs. Other agriculture-related issues still need to be considered separately, potentially leading to contentious debates.

“Today, marks a grave turning point for our country, one which leaves rural communities and farmers behind, and places us on the road toward increased hunger, less prosperity and fewer opportunities for working families,” Craig said on July 3 shortly after Congress finalized the legislation. “This bill takes food away from millions of children, seniors, veterans and people with disabilities. Congressional Republicans have sold out ordinary Americans to pay for tax breaks for the ultra-rich and large corporations.”

Supporters of the bill counter nutrition funding cuts do not harm families. They argue some funds were being wasted, and others were going to “able-bodied” recipients who should be able to earn money on their own. House Ag Committee Chair Glenn “GT” Thompson, R-Pa., called the budget bill a “game-changer for America.”

“The One Big Beautiful Bill is a victory for rural America, making the largest investment in agriculture in decades, restoring integrity to SNAP, and saving millions of family farms from the death tax,” Thompson said in his own statement July 3. “This bill gives President Trump the tools he needs to keep America safe, strong and free.”

New tax rules stand to benefit farmers

Outside of the specific agriculture provisions in the budget bill, congressional efforts to ensure lower taxes were widely cheered by farm groups. The budget bill makes many tax cuts enacted in 2017 permanent. That includes the 20% qualified business income deduction, or Section 199A, as well as the $15 million estate tax exemption.

The bill also allows farmers to write off more expenses and depreciation costs. Eligibility for Section 45Z clean fuel production credits is now limited to fuels utilizing feedstock from the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

While the debate over passing the “big, beautiful bill” has ended, questions regarding its long-term impact will almost certainly drag on.

The announcements this week included Indonesia, Japan, and Australia.

These were the details specific to ag products:

Indonesia will ""address and prevent barriers to U.S. agricultural products in the Indonesian market,"" according to a White House fact sheet. That includes buying around $4.5 billion of soybeans, soybean meal, wheat, and cotton. Indonesia is already the U.S.’s fifth largest soybean trading partner by volume, according to the USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service.

Japan will buy $8 billion of U.S. goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel, and increase import quotas for U.S. rice by 75%.

Australia will ease restrictions on U.S. beef imports, accepting shipments of fresh and frozen U.S. beef for the first time in 20 years.

“I’m doing a little celebration,” said Cassandra Kuball, vice president at Torrey Advisory Group, on the Indonesia agreement. “It’s great to see something come to fruition and give us a sense of what is able to, hopefully, be accomplished.”

Indonesia

American Soybean Association

The American Soybean Association (ASA) represents U.S. soybean farmers on domestic and international policy issues. ASA has 26 affiliate state associations representing 30 soybean-producing states and nearly 500,000 soybean farmers.

“We appreciate President Trump and his administration’s efforts in maintaining market access for U.S. soybeans into Indonesia, and the commitment from [United States Trade Representative] USTR to address non-tariff barriers in that market,” Caleb Ragland, American Soybean Association president and a Kentucky soybean farmer, said in a statement. “We look forward to future deals like this that reduce tariffs and ensure continued and increased market access for U.S. agriculture.”

National Milk Producers Federation

The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) “develops and carries out policies that advance dairy producers and the cooperatives they own. NMPF’s member cooperatives produce more than two-thirds of U.S. milk, making NMPF dairy’s voice on Capitol Hill and with government agencies.”

“This looks like it will be a significant win for U.S. dairy. We commend the Trump administration for securing an agreement that should deliver real benefits for our dairy farmers,” said Gregg Doud, president and CEO of NMPF. “We are pleased to hear this framework removes roadblocks to trade and will help grow dairy sales in one of the world’s most populous markets. NMPF looks forward to reviewing the details of the agreement and working with the administration to ensure Indonesia upholds its end of the bargain.”

Japan

National Corn Growers Association

Founded in 1957, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) represents more than 36,000 dues-paying corn growers in 48 states, and the interests of more than 300,000 farmers who contribute through corn checkoff programs in their state.

In response to the announcement, Illinois farmer and NCGA President Kenneth Hartman Jr. made the following statement:

“We appreciate the work that the administration has dedicated to brokering a deal with Japan, worth $2.7 billion, and we welcome today’s announcement. Japan is the second-largest market for U.S. corn exports, and we support any effort to expand the purchase of corn and corn products, like ethanol. U.S. corn growers produce an abundant crop year in and year out, and NCGA has long advocated for increased access to foreign markets, which will support American farmers and rural economies.”

USA Rice Federation

USA Rice Federation (USA Rice) is the global advocate for all segments of the U.S. rice industry, with a mission to ensure the health and vitality of a unified U.S. rice industry by advocating on behalf of farmers, millers, merchants, and allied businesses.

“With this trade deal, President Trump has further solidified the importance of Japan as a market for high-quality U.S. rice,” said USA Rice President and CEO Peter Bachmann. “Japan is consistently among our top export markets in terms of both value and volume, but this will be the first opportunity since the 1990s to further that market access. We thank the president for continuing to prioritize additional rice market access throughout the negotiating process and we look forward to working with our Japanese counterparts on the implementation of the agreement.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has represented Louisiana’s fourth district since 2016.

“I was with President Trump in the Oval tonight as he negotiated this historic deal!” Johnson posted to X. “This deal with Japan will bring a $550 billion investment in America, hundreds of thousands of jobs, and a huge increase in trade between our two countries.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, has represented New York since 1998.

“Like most of his ‘deals,’ it was big on promises, short on detail, and provided zero relief for American families and small businesses,” Schumer said on X. “The Trump tariff taxes keep going up, not down. That means one thing: higher costs for American families.”

Australia

Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins

USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins issued a statement congratulating President Trump on the Australia announcement.

“American farmers and ranchers produce the safest, healthiest beef in the world,” she said. “It’s absurd that non-scientific trade barriers prevented our beef from being sold to consumers in Australia for the last 20 years. Gone are the days of putting American farmers on the sidelines. This is yet another example of the kind of market access the president negotiates to bring America into a new golden age of prosperity, with American agriculture leading the way.”

National Cattlemen’s Beef Association

The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association (NCBA) has represented America's cattle producers since 1898 and is the largest association of cattle producers in the United States.

“For 20 years, U.S. beef was denied access to Australia while Australia exported $29 billion of beef to U.S. consumers. The lack of two-way, science-based trade has been a sticking point for many years, and we are pleased that President Trump has successfully opened the Australian market to American beef,” NCBA President and Nebraska cattleman Buck Wehrbein said. “NCBA has spent decades working to correct this trade imbalance and we are proud to have a president who is willing to fight for American farmers and ranchers, expand export markets, and fix unfair trade agreements across the world.”

“The United States is the gold standard for safe and delicious beef, and we have some of the highest animal health and food safety standards in the world,” NCBA Executive Director of Government Affairs Kent Bacus added. “Opening the Australian market to American beef will benefit our producers at home, while also offering Australian consumers the opportunity to enjoy our high-quality beef.”",https://www.agriculture.com/thmb/_3RtjRl50BwpdwUPUR-lJGXoZ3A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/anthony-mucci-glo_zQOnXf4-unsplash-001344dbf396434c8b185a1e184d6498.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 14:56:18.008212

While 45Z primarily benefits fuel producers, the recent updates offer new clarity and opportunities for U.S. farmers — if challenges can be addressed in time.

The 45Z credit applies to clean fuels produced after December 31, 2024, and was originally set to expire in 2027. Under OBBBA, it’s now extended through 2029, giving biofuel producers more time to invest in clean fuel technology.

But the real impact for agriculture lies in how carbon intensity is calculated and which feedstocks qualify. Using the Department of Energy’s 45ZCF-GREET model, emissions are assessed from field to fuel tank. The lower the CI score, the higher the credit — ranging from 20 cents to $1 per gallon.

Key changes under OBBBA include:

Exclusion of indirect land use change from GREET calculations

Feedstocks must be sourced from North America

Fuels must be produced by U.S.-controlled firms

Elimination of extra premiums for sustainable aviation fuel

Increased credits for small producers

These updates aim to reward clean practices while cracking down on credit abuse, such as imported used cooking oil misclassified for higher payouts.

Farm-Level Impacts: New Demand, More Strings

Even though farmers don’t directly receive 45Z credits, demand for corn, soybeans, crop residues, and other feedstocks is expected to rise. USDA projects 35% of U.S. corn in 2025 will go to ethanol, while over 50% of soybean oil will be used in biofuels.

But there’s a catch: feedstocks must come from low-carbon farming practices — like no-till, cover crops, and nutrient-efficient fertilizers — to help fuel producers lower their CI scores and qualify for higher credits.

“Traditionally produced corn, with a standard CI score of 29.1, wouldn’t qualify,” explain Samantha Ayoub and Faith Parum, American Farm Bureau Federation economists. “However, incorporating conservation practices can improve CI scores and unlock eligibility.”

This creates potential for premium contracts between fuel producers and farmers. Still, these arrangements may include costly certification requirements and limit a farmer’s flexibility. As Ayoub and Parum note, “These contracts may also come with burdensome and costly certification requirements… locking farmers into specific production practices.”

Challenges in implementation

While the intent of 45Z is clear, implementation is not. The Department of Treasury and IRS must still issue new guidance, and USDA is finalizing which conservation practices qualify.

Currently, adoption of these practices is still low:

Cover crops: ~5% of cropland

Reduced tillage: ~25%

No-till: ~28%

Even if fuel producers are eager to offer contracts, Ayoub and Parum warn, “Without guarantees that their investments will be returned through crop premiums or credit passthroughs, it will likely be slow going to grow eligible feedstock acres.”

OBBBA’s changes to 45Z open the door for more demand for domestic feedstocks and provide a framework that favors U.S. farmers — if policies and compensation mechanisms fall into place quickly.",https://www.agdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/shutterstock_1218071932.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 13:56:27.970911

The growth potential of the SAF market is immense, as it currently accounts for less than 0.5% of all aviation fuel use.","The aviation sector stands out as one of the most challenging industries to decarbonize. Despite these challenges, aviation plays a critical role in the global fight against climate change, currently accounting for 3% of total greenhouse gas emissions. This impact is set to grow in the coming decades. According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), global air travel demand is expected to surge, with passenger traffic projected to reach 19.5 billion by 2042—more than double the volume recorded in 2024.

Addressing aviation emissions has become increasingly urgent in the global effort to meet climate targets. In response, the aviation industry has made an international commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. According to a study by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the most viable pathway to reaching this goal is through the widespread adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAFs are renewable or waste-derived fuels that meet strict sustainability criteria and are designed to serve as drop-in replacements for conventional jet fuels. Unlike more capital-intensive solutions—such as retrofitting existing aircraft or developing entirely new technologies—SAFs require minimal changes to current aircraft and infrastructure. This makes them one of the most practical and promising tools for decarbonizing aviation in the near to mid-term.

SAF can be produced from a diverse array of feedstocks, including ethanol, used cooking oils and greases, and agricultural or forestry residues. Compared to conventional jet fuel, SAF offers a significant reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions—by as much as 80%. To date, 11 production pathways have been certified for SAF, with the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) process, which converts ethanol into jet fuel, emerging as one of the most promising and scalable options.

Brazil is already a global leader in the use of biofuels for ground transportation and is now advancing efforts to produce SAF. These initiatives include not only SAF derived from ethanol but also from biomethane, which is obtained through the purification of biogas. Biogas represents a new frontier in renewable energy, generated from by-products of ethanol and sugar production—such as vinasse and filter cake—making the process both sustainable and circular.

Furthermore, a recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) identified Brazil as the Latin American country with the greatest potential to produce SAF at the largest scale and lowest cost (ranging from $1.11 to $1.77/liter). This positions Brazil not only to meet regional demand but also to contribute significantly to global supply.

The growth potential of the SAF market is immense, as it currently accounts for less than 0.5% of all aviation fuel use. However, several challenges must be overcome to unlock its full potential in decarbonizing the sector and phasing out fossil fuels. According to a report by the World Economic Forum, the primary obstacles to aviation decarbonization are the limited availability and high cost of SAF. Addressing these challenges will require strong public policy frameworks and substantial investment. ICAO estimates that approximately $3.2 trillion in investment will be required to scale up cleaner aviation fuel production and achieve its goal of net-zero emissions from international aviation by 2050.

A coordinated global effort is essential to establish stable policy frameworks that foster long-term markets, attract investment, and drive technological innovation in SAF. The upcoming COP30 in Belém presents a pivotal opportunity for governments, industry, and civil society to come together and help to build the financial and regulatory foundation SAF needs to scale. By aligning investment, public policy, and international cooperation, the world can lay the groundwork for SAF to become a cornerstone of decarbonized aviation—and take a decisive step toward a more sustainable, low-carbon future.",https://www.sugarcane.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SAF.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 16:56:26.854828

The airline became the world’s first to integrate solar fuel, developed by the clean-tech company Synhelion, in its regular flight operations. It marks a pivotal step towards reducing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.

Clean Fuel From the Sun

Synhelion produces sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from sunlight. The process reportedly harnesses concentrated solar heat to create syngas (synthesis gas), which is then synthesized into kerosene through industrial methods. Synhelion calls it “sun-to-liquid” fuel, saying it closes the carbon cycle. According to the company, its combustion only releases CO2 that was absorbed during the manufacturing process.

Synhelion delivered a 190-liter barrel of synthetic crude oil derived from solar energy. The company transported it to a refinery in Northern Germany, where it was processed into certified Jet-A-1 aviation fuel. SWISS “seamlessly” integrated the fuel into its operational infrastructure at Hamburg Airport in Germany.

The smooth integration of the solar fuel confirmed that the technology is ready for broader applications.

“This first delivery of Synhelion’s solar fuel marks a genuine milestone in our long-standing partnership,” said SWISS CEO Jens Fehlinger. “We have intentionally invested in a Swiss start-up, and we are delighted to celebrate this landmark achievement together.”

Fehlinger noted that this is the first time solar fuel has been used in civil aviation. “We are truly proud to be playing such a pioneering role, in partnership with Synhelion, in driving and developing this vital new technology for a more sustainable aviation sector,” the CEO added.

Philipp Furler, co-founder and co-CEO of Synhelion, emphasized the fuel’s potential to secure a sustainable future for the aviation industry.

“This milestone brings us one step closer to globally scaling up our solar fuel technology,” he said. “And we’re very grateful to have such invaluable support from our partners at SWISS and the Lufthansa Group as we continue on this journey.”

As the two companies focus on the future, they realize how important sustainable fuels like Synhelion’s solar fuel will be for the aviation sector. Specifically, to meet ambitious carbon reduction goals. Looking ahead, the companies must develop factories for continuous production and scaling capacities. They believe the fuel will hit the commercial market in 2027.

However, the next immediate step is getting both the production process and the fuel sustainably certified.",https://www.tomorrowsworldtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/swiss-solar-fuel.png,N,,2025-07-25 12:56:23.232029

Boom Supersonic has attracted 130 orders, “pre-orders” and options from American Airlines, United and Japan Airlines.
Earlier this year the Colorado company’s supersonic test bed, known as XB1, became the first independently-funded jet to break the sound barrier.
Nostalgia for the supersonic flight has been particularly notable this week – 25 years after the Concorde Air France crash.
“Sustainable supersonic travel unlocks new possibilities for business relationships, prospects for vacation and opportunities for human connection.”","“Our ultimate goal is to bring the benefits of supersonic flight to everyone” – so says Blake Scholl, founder and chief executive of Boom Supersonic.

His company, based in Denver, is at the forefront of the race to find a successor to Concorde. The chosen name: Overture.

“Flights onboard Overture will cut travel times in half, ushering in the next era of faster travel,” the firm says. Boom Supersonic has attracted 130 orders, “pre-orders” and options from American Airlines, United and Japan Airlines.

Earlier this year the Colorado company’s supersonic test bed, known as XB1, became the first independently-funded jet to break the sound barrier.

Boom Supersonic says its production plane, known as Overture, will fly at 60,000 feet, the same as Concorde. The speed, Mach 1.7, is one-sixth slower – but still twice as fast as subsonic aircraft. It claims London-New York will take three hours 45 minutes, comparable with Concorde’s historic schedule.

Nostalgia for the supersonic flight has been particularly notable this week – 25 years after the Concorde Air France crash.

But had Concorde not been taken out of service on commercial grounds, it would surely by now have been grounded because of the environmental damage. On a London-New York trip, it would deafen bystanders at either end of the route and burn through 100 tons of aviation fuel; a Boeing 787 carries three times as many passengers for half as much fuel.

Boom Supersonic can fly on 100 per cent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), though critics question the claimed benefits of this scarce substance.

A clue to a noisier environmental problem lies in the name: Boom. Concorde was unable to fly faster than the speed of sound overland because of the shockwave that supersonic aircraft create – which is experienced as a thunder-like boom by a person who is on the ground.

Boom Supersonic believes it has come up with a solution: reducing the aircraft’s speed while flying over land to about Mach 1.2. “By flying at a sufficiently high altitude at an appropriate speed for current atmospheric conditions, Overture’s sonic boom never reaches the ground,” the firm says.

“When in Boomless Cruise, speeds are 40-50 per cent faster than conventional airliners. This means a flight from New York to Los Angeles can be up to 90 minutes shorter.

“At top speeds of Mach 1.7, flight times are twice as fast and sonic booms are only created over water.”

The range will be 4,890 miles – only about one-sixth more than Concorde’s maximum, but opening up many more potential routes such as London to Miami, Los Angeles to Lima and Brisbane to Tokyo. Boom Supersonic says potentially there are more than 600 “profitable routes” worldwide.

While Concorde fares were typically about 20 per cent higher than subsonic first class, Boom Supersonic says it expects airlines operating Overture will profitable with fares at business to first class levels.

One of Boom’s advisory council is Captain Mike Bannister, former Concorde chief pilot. He says: “I’ve been waiting over 20 years for an environmentally friendly successor to Concorde and XB-1’s supersonic flight is a major landmark towards my dreams being realised.

“When I last flew Concorde in 2003 I knew that this day would come.”

But senior aviation executive Jonathan Hinkles believes the ways of the travel world have changed dramatically over the past 22 years – and that Zoom could pose problems for Boom.

He told The Independent’s daily travel podcast: “If you look at what Concorde did, it was a way of being able to leave London at 7pm, arrive in New York at 5.50pm, so you'd be basically travelling through time to arrive in New York before the flight had left London in local time.

“But of course, today we've got Zoom, we've got Teams. A lot of business meetings that were the bedrock of why people flew on Concorde don't actually require people to fly anymore.

“The market that supported Concorde through its life has moved on fundamentally. I just can't see that there's an economic case for a successor. For the foreseeable future we're going to be very much confined to flying around at 550mph.”

Lyn Hughes, founding editor of Wanderlust magazine, concurs: “I think the public are less concerned now with the speed of the flights than they are with other factors: safety, convenience, reliability, value for money and comfort.

“The real revolution now would be a better experience at the airport pre and post the flight, and a comfortable experience on it – and, of course, for a more sustainable, carbon-free flight.”

But Blake Scholl, CEO of Boom Supersonic, is convinced speed will prevail: “We believe in a world where more people can go to more places more often.

The new reality is sobering: feedstock constraints, unresolved technology challenges and fragmented global policies are stalling progress.

Today, SAF still accounts for only 0.3% of jet fuel use globally and industry experts warn it could take 15 years or more before production scales sufficiently ‒ and costs drop low enough ‒ for SAF to be viable without heavy government subsidies. Current trajectories suggest SAF might address just 20% of aviation fuel needs by 2050. Without a dramatic acceleration in production and supportive policy shifts ‒ even low-hanging fruit such as SAF-specific carbon accounting or “book and claim” mechanisms under the GHG Protocol ‒ the dream of SAF delivering the lion’s share of emissions reductions is slipping away.

Unless the industry confronts the economics head-on and policymakers step in to close the gap, SAF contribution to net zero will be considerably less ‒ it’ll be a luxury fuel with a green premium.

Market-based measures like carbon offsets function in aviation as they do across industries ‒ enabling the purchase of verified carbon reductions through projects such as reforestation or carbon capture. Typically considered a last resort after all other decarbonization strategies are deployed (see Exhibit 2), offsets can be voluntarily bought by airlines, consumers or corporations. Regulatory programs like the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and CORSIA may soon require mandatory offset purchases if emissions targets are not met. Despite their role, these market-based solutions will always carry a green premium.

Despite growing climate awareness, only a small fraction of consumers is willing to pay extra to shrink their carbon footprint. Who ultimately bears the cost of green premiums will hinge on regulatory mandates, market pressure and how much companies ‒ and their stakeholders ‒ are prepared to absorb or shift those costs downstream. A carbon price may nudge the balance, but it won’t erase the fundamental economic reality: green still costs more, and someone has to pay.

Operational and infrastructure upgrades can unlock “green discounts” by cutting fuel use, lowering emissions and optimizing flight operations. These range from reduced taxiing times and smarter routing between airports to continuous climb/descent and weather-optimized flight paths. Programs like NextGen in the US and SESAR in Europe aim to deliver such efficiencies. However, legacy systems, budget constraints and the complexity of change management mean emissions reductions from these efforts may likely meet ‒ but not exceed ‒ current projections. While critical for safety and capacity amid growing demand, their role in reaching net zero will be limited.

For technology improvements to make a substantially larger contribution to achieving net zero, industry would need to overcome at least three impediments that are intertwined.

Technology readiness and integration

Aviation needs transformative breakthroughs ‒ revolutionary aircraft architectures like blended wing bodies and truss-braced wings offer up to 50% fuel burn reduction through dramatic aerodynamic gains. But realizing their potential comes with steep integration challenges: cabin layout, pressurization, emergency egress and regulatory certification remain unresolved. When paired with innovations in conventional propulsion (e.g., geared turbofans, open rotors) or alternative power systems (e.g., hybrid-electric, hydrogen combustion, fuel cells), next-generation materials (e.g., advanced composites, 3D printing, morphing surfaces) and digital/autonomous systems, the pathway to step-change efficiency becomes viable. Yet, several of these technologies remain largely immature today. The industry must break away from multidecade innovation cycles and embrace faster, bolder development, validation and commercialization pathways.

Development and certification duration

Today’s aircraft development timeline ‒ often 10 years or more from launch to entry into service ‒ is too slow for the scale of transformation needed. Model-based engineering, digital twins and AI-assisted design enable faster iterations and smarter trade-offs. These tools can drastically reduce the time required to design, simulate, test and certify new aircraft. If harnessed effectively, they could enable more frequent introductions of clean-sheet designs and faster replacement of legacy fleets.

Business case viability

The current business model in the industry is rooted in a 40+ year aircraft program lifecycle. Given the high development cost, manufacturers in most aircraft subsystem segments depend on the lucrative aftermarket – which starts around 7+ years and peaks 15+ years post-entry into service of a new program. Unfortunately, this also exacerbates the challenges that systems providers take on, which can reduce the appetite for the risk inherent in a radically new (and potentially more sustainable) design.

Profit pools are unevenly distributed across the value chain ‒ systems providers and component manufacturers often capture more economic profit than airframers or airlines. Airframers desire to capture a larger portion of the value created, while systems OEMs would like to lower risk and improve timing of value realization and payback. Airlines prefer a low acquisition cost of aircraft but also want less ambiguity in lifecycle cost, which is intensified by new technologies and increasing operations in a harsher environment. This confluence of profitability, risk and uncertainty-related challenges across the value chain could open the door for more equitable or disruptive business models with implications.

If airframers were to capture a larger portion of program value and economic profit, they could increase the frequency of new aircraft model introductions with higher fuel efficiency. In which case, systems providers, particularly propulsion system providers, would have to contend with a shorter lifecycle, requiring their business model to rely on initial sale instead of aftermarket revenue. The total cost of ownership would need to remain comparable to current models, while increased upfront cost would be offset by lower fuel and maintenance costs for airlines. The initial sale profitability could balance out the significant long-term risk of the existing model.

Airlines would, of course, benefit from the lower operational costs related to fuel but will likely seek alternate options to address the higher acquisition cost for propulsion and other major aircraft systems. Financial sponsors may leverage their balance sheet strength to offer availability-based models, providing flexibility for airlines to make operational and capacity decisions.

A question remains of whether airframers and systems providers can remain profitable with a shorter program run, where new technology introductions trigger planes to retire at 20 years rather than 30 years. We have seen this play out effectively in business aviation. Can this transfer to commercial aviation? Achieving net zero may rely on it.",https://www.ey.com/content/dam/ey-unified-site/ey-com/en-us/insights/aerospace-defense/images/ey-an-engineer-focuses-on-complex-aircraft-designs-displayed-across-multiple-screens.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 15:56:24.085342

Whereas OBBBA did not outright cancel the Section 45V clean hydrogen production tax credits as earlier feared, it did accelerate the deadline for projects to begin construction to be eligible for the credit, bringing the deadline forward to December 31, 2027 from January 1, 2033 as originally envisioned in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022.

Losing 45V tax credits is likely to seriously erode the economic viability of many hydrogen projects in the country, with Louisiana set to feel the heat the most.

Louisiana is home to some of the biggest hydrogen projects in the United States, including Clean Hydrogen Works' $7.5 billion ammonia and blue hydrogen projects as well as Air Products (NYSE:APD)' $4.5 billion blue hydrogen plant.

However, OBBBA is not solely to blame for the stalling hydrogen sector, with dozens of green hydrogen developers across the globe scaling back investments or scrapping them altogether thanks to weak demand for the low-carbon fuel coupled with soaring production costs.

Last year, U.S. startup Hy Stor Energy canceled its reservation for over 1 gigawatt of electrolyzer capacity with Nel, a Norwegian electrolyzer manufacturer, for its Mississippi Clean Hydrogen Hub project. The company said the move was due to market headwinds and delays in bringing the project to fruition, making it financially unfeasible to make upcoming capacity reservation payments. However, Hy Stor said it was not canceling the hydrogen hub itself.

Back in February, Allentown, Pennsylvania-based Air Products announced plans to cancel several green hydrogen projects in the U.S., including a $500 million facility in New York and a sustainable aviation fuel project in California. These decisions are part of the company’s broader $3.1 billion write-down and are driven by challenging commercial and regulatory factors, including the need to strengthen the company's focus on projects that deliver value for shareholders.

Not even Europe’s energy heavyweights have been spared the carnage.

Last year, we reported that Shell Plc. (NYSE:SHEL) had scrapped plans to build a low-carbon hydrogen plant in Norway citing lack of demand, days before Norway’s NOC Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) announced similar plans, ""We haven't seen the market for blue hydrogen materialize and decided not to progress the project,"" a Shell spokesperson has told Reuters.

BP Plc. (NYSE:BP) said in April that it was abandoning its hydrogen ambitions in favor of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for transport. This week, BP announced that it will exit the $36-billion green hydrogen production facility planned in Australia. BP has informed its Australian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) partners that it will leave its role as the project’s operator and equity holder.

Last year, Spain’s Iberdrola (OTCPK:IBDRY)(OTCPK:IBDSF), Europe's largest utility, said it would scale back its green hydrogen investments by almost two thirds due to funding delays for some projects. The company cut its 2030 production target to ~120,000 tons of green hydrogen a year, down from its previous goal of 350,000 tons.

Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal S.A. (NYSE:MT) has abandoned plans to convert two of its steel plants in Germany to hydrogen, despite the steelmaker being offered 1.3 billion euros in public subsidies for the 2.5 billion euro ($2.9 billion) project.

Meanwhile, back in February, Spain's Repsol (OTCQX: REPYY) scaled back its 2030 green hydrogen production target, cutting it by as much as 63%. The company's new target is between 0.7 and 1.2 gigawatts (GW) of electrolyzer capacity, down from a previous goal of 1.9 GW. Repsol cited challenges in market development, regulatory uncertainties, and the high cost of green hydrogen production, particularly without subsidies.

The Australian market has been hard hit, too. In September 2024, Woodside Energy (NYSE:WDS), the country’s largest independent oil and gas producer, shelved plans to build two green hydrogen projects in Australia and New Zealand.

In March this year, giant oil and commodities trader Trafigura, ditched plans to build a green hydrogen plant at the company’s Port Pirie lead smelter in South Australia for A$750 million ($491.5 million).

Meanwhile, the Queensland state government pulled the plug on plans to fund a A$12.5 billion green hydrogen plant by 2028, with the massive project slated to become one of Australia’s largest and most advanced green hydrogen projects.

Finally, Japan's Kawasaki Heavy Industries announced it will not go ahead with its coal-to-hydrogen project in Latrobe, Australia, citing time and cost pressures.

The mounting cancellations suggest a sector still searching for viable economics, not just policy certainty. While OBBBA’s accelerated tax credit deadline has undoubtedly raised the stakes for U.S. developers, the global pullback points to deeper market fractures: low offtake demand, high capital costs, and insufficient infrastructure. With major players in the U.S., Europe, and Australia walking away or scaling back, the once-hyped green hydrogen boom is looking more like a trickle. For now.

ATC Charges Cut and effect in Cost-Cutting of Passenger Fare Price

All it knows is that it is going to cut air traffic control charges massively and is going to reform the existing air tax system. This amendment is one of many steps to enhance the connectivity and lower the costs of travel in the industry and keep Germany competitive as a leading aerotransport hub in Europe. The changes are also aimed at better reflecting environmental goals established by the EU Green Deal.

At present, Germany has some of the highest air passenger taxes in Europe, which many airlines and tourism boards believe acts as a deterrent to flying and the economic recovery of the travel industry. In reconsidering these taxes, the federal government hopes to help both the aviation sector and travelers.

Key Measures and Timeline

Cuts to the aviation taxes will come into effect in January 2026 subject to approval and legislative process. This comes after discussions with industry, including airlines, airport operators, and consumer groups. The proposed adjustments include:

Reducing the existing tiered air passenger tax

Introduction of incentives for the use of low-emission or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)

Lowering charges on short-haul flights within the EU area

Increasing subsidies for regional airports

The measures are designed to deliver short-term relief to passengers while promoting more sustainable aviation in the long-run.

Impact on Travelers and Airlines

Travelers will benefit in the form of cheaper ticket prices, particularly on domestic and intra-European routes, as a result of the lower air taxes. Winged wallets and holiday-makers on a budget are likely to be the biggest winners from the reform, which could prompt a renewed wave of short- and medium-haul bookings from as early as 2026.

Carriers in Germany, especially those with low-cost business models, should benefit from increased demand. Some carriers such as Eurowings, Lufthansa Group units and Ryanair have lobbied for years against Germany’s high aviation fees, saying they stifle growth and push operations out of the country to neighbors.

The reform should help take away the financial incentive for airlines to run their operations from abroad, and to develop the major airports in Germany such as Frankfurt, Munich and Berlin.

Competitive Edge in European Aviation Industry

The new approach is also in response to what other countries in the vicinity of the UK are doing in relation to aviation taxation. For example, Spain recently declared a freeze in air passenger duty and France made available grants for green travel. Germany has been liberalising to try to level the playing field and boost the competitiveness of its airports across Europe.

Germany experienced a 14.2 per cent rise in air passengers during 2024 over the previous year, figures from the country’s federal statistical office Destatis show. Analysts think the policy change could spur more growth, particularly if consumers are cost-conscious in an age of rapidly rising inflation and travel demand.

Support for Environmental Sustainability

Affordability is the end all, be all of the tax cut, but the environment is still a major focus. The government has confirmed that airlines that fly using sustainable aviation fuels, or that operate newer fuel-efficient planes, will also get more of a benefit in the new scheme. It also fits into the EU’s broader decarbonization ambitions for transport and aviation.

Under the “Fit for 55” package of legislative proposals, the EU aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. The reform of the German aviation tax is supposed to be a set up that ensures that it pays off for airlines to act sustainably.

Industry Response of the Advent of Cost- Effective Airlines

Airlines are broadly supportive of the notice. The German Aviation Association (BDL) said the reform would be a welcome relief for carriers operating in a cutthroat European market. Leaders in the travel industry also emphasized the prospects of more inbound tourism and improved regional linkages.

Consumer advocates, meanwhile, are cautiously optimistic. Equally, they welcome lower operating costs for travel, but demand transparency over how these cost-savings will be passed on to the consumer and the need for continued investment in sustainability.

Looking Ahead for the development of German Airline Industry

The plans are part of a long-term vision by Germany to deliver a more equal spread of economic growth, consumer welfare and environmental responsibility in the country’s aviation industry. By lates 2025, when legislative frameworks are expected to be put in place, stakeholders will be watching carefully to see how the prices of air tickets, the volume of flights, and carbon reduction targets are affected by the new policies.

Projects in Hydrogen Allocation Round 1 (HAR1) span the UK and involve producing hydrogen for a range of industries, including mining, aviation and transportation.

The projects are expected to create more than 700 jobs during construction and operation including jobs for apprentices, graduates, and engineers.

HAR1 projects will have access to £2bn (US$2.7bn) of support over 15 years from the Hydrogen Production Business Model, and more than £90m in capital expenditure from the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund. A further £400m of private investment has been committed to these projects.

Clare Jackson, the CEO of trade body Hydrogen UK said: “Signing these contracts demonstrates the confidence and commitment of both the government and industry in building a sustainable hydrogen sector.”

Regional projects

The projects were first picked up by the government in December of last year before being agreed on by the Low Carbon Contracts Company – a government body tasked with securing private investment for green energy projects in the UK. It also leads the Contracts for Difference scheme.

The projects in HAR1 includes the Langage green hydrogen project in Plymouth, operated by renewable energy firm Carlton Power. The project intends to develop a green hydrogen plant with an initial capacity of 10 MW, to supply hydrogen to industrial facilities in the region. Carlton Power says that the hydrogen produced by the initial 10 MW plant will reduce CO2 emissions in Plymouth by more than 7,000 t annually.

EDF and its hydrogen subsidiary Hynamics is developing the Tees Green hydrogen project in Redcar, Teesside. Hydrogen will be produced from electricity generated from the Teesside Offshore Wind Farm – which has a capacity of 62 MW – and used to produce sustainable aviation fuel.

Another is the HyMarnham project in Newark, jointly backed byGeoPura and animal food waste processor JG Pears. The project involves the development of a hydrogen production facility situated at a former coal fired power station and powered by 43 MW of solar power and 8 MW of electrolysers. GeoPura will use the hydrogen to supply their remote power generation units, whereas JG Pears will use it to power its waste disposal operations.

Alistair Collins, director of HyMarnham Power, said: “As one of the first HAR1 projects now commissioning electrolyser systems, we’re proud to demonstrate what government support can unlock.”

The government expect HAR1 projects to be online between 2025 and April 2028. It has also shortlisted 27 projects for HAR2, with the confirmed projects to be announced next year.",https://www.thechemicalengineer.com/media/22780/hydrogen.jpg?width=960,N,,2025-07-25 11:56:14.546274

Sweden has taken such an advanced step all thanks to Heart Aerospace, a Swedish startup in the aerospace industry. The startup’s hybrid-electric aircraft, the ES-30 utilizes the perfect fuel to enable it to takeoff and this is a fuel that beats hydrogen and electricity. Being used in the ES-30 is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a type of clean-burning fuel that allows aircrafts to fly without being plagued by the guilt of having caused harm to the climate. Swedish engineering is behind this incredible SAF.

Understanding SAF and what it means for flights?

All thanks to Swedish development, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has offered an alternative fuel option, and this fuel is created using cooking oil, algae, as well as agricultural waste. CO₂ emissions are fully reduced by 80% making the fuel one of the best alternatives for carbon.

SAF is seen as the most desirable fuel as it is compatible with aircraft infrastructure in that are already in existence. This fuel source can be effortlessly blended with traditional jet fuel and can be adapted to modern jet engines without requiring any adjustments.

This new SAF fuel by Swedish engineers works well with extended-range propulsion systems and it becomes evident in the ES-30 aircraft which can fly to about 800 kilometers when utilizing SAF in reserve generators. In battery-only mode, the aircraft can merely fly to about 200 kilometers. Only the best technologies have been combined.

The hybrid-electric combination

Sweden made its mark in terms of ensuring cleaner cities, but Sweden is now establishing itself as a leader in the aerospace industry that is also moving towards a cleaner climate agenda. The Gothenburg-based company, Heart Aerospace surely is making its mark by engineering the ES-30 which is a 30-seat hybrid-electric aircraft more geared towards short haul flights.

The Heart X1 was revealed in 2024, and it was the model meant specifically for ground testing. The full electric test flight will take place in 2025, and the idea is for hybrid-electric flights to follow shortly thereafter in 2026. Thus, the ES-30 will result in takeoffs leaving behind no emissions. The ES-30 will be greater for shorter routes.

This overall design makes it possible for aircrafts like the ES-30 to takeoff from smaller airports and this has increased the need for new regional airports. Since innovative agency, Vinnova, supports the ES-30, this ES-30 boasts some locally developed technologies that will improve lifting and lead to noise reductions.

600 kW to soar the skies offering a cleaner than hydrogen alternative that is more powerful than conventional fuels, ZeroAvia, too, is taking the cleaner fuel agenda to the skies and Sweden surely is following suit.

Sweden’s newer aviation motive: global and local benefits

Sweden is occupied with not only creating a future pathway for the global aviation industry but seems to be testing and utilizing such cleaner agenda at home. SAS, Swedavia, and Braathens Regional Airlines are contributing to such operational trials. Hybrid-electric flights is perhaps a dream come true and not just a dream far out of reach.

On the global front, AirAsia, Southeast Asia’s low-cost airline, has joined forces with Heart Aerospace’s Industry Advisory Board securing 250 firm orders for the ES-30, and it looks as if the 250-order amount is soon to increase to 500.

Sustainable flying- not only an option for Sweden

SAF spells better reliability and range while electric propulsion seems best for the short haul. Sweden is offering passengers the chance to fly without the worry of harming the climate in any way when they fly. The ES-30 is not at all merely a plane, it is setting the way forward for sustainable air travel options and Sweden is establishing its mark at the finish line.",https://www.ecoticias.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/22-7-2025_214226_heartaerospace.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 11:56:17.799789

The funding from TRaCE has been boosted by industry partners to total AUD$4.2 million (USD$2.76 million), with the aim of achieving a critical breakthrough in the reduction of emissions in aviation.

The electrolyzer converts carbon dioxide and water into precursors that can then ultimately be turned into green fuel for aircraft.

The UNSW-led project, involving Rahman Daiyan, Scientia Professor Rose Amal and adjunct Professor Jimmy Yun will work in association with Australian partner Tjindu Power and Chuangqi Times (Qingdao) Technology Co., a clean-tech developer based in China.

The team has already developed a carbon-dioxide electrolyzer system using low-cost transition metal and carbon catalysts, which can be integrated with the well-established Fischer-Tropsch process to produce sustainable aviation fuel.

Decarbonizing aviation is one of the toughest challenges in the race to net zero.

Unlike cars or homes, planes can’t easily switch to be electrified and the fuels they burn release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

Globally, aviation accounts for about 2 percent to 3 percent of emissions, but it’s a fast-growing sector with limited alternatives.

Many emerging clean-energy technologies aim to replace fossil-fuel production with sustainable aviation fuels and eFuels but these solutions are still expensive, energy-intensive and not yet ready for mass deployment.

“Our goal is to revolutionize how we produce clean fuels for aviation, using renewable energy to transform CO2 into usable fuels without requiring costly infrastructure changes,” said Daiyan, a Scientia fellow in the School of Mineral and Energy Resources Engineering and lead chief investigator at UNSW. “This technology could be the key to decarbonizing aviation, one of the world’s most challenging sectors.”

Amal, from the School of Chemical Engineering, added, “This breakthrough proves that with smart catalyst design and integrated system thinking, we can transform waste CO2 into the very fuels that drive our economy. It’s the kind of scalable innovation we need to tackle hard-to-abate sectors and achieve net zero.”

The grant from TRaCE will help to move the technology from technology-readiness level (TRL) 4, which is proof-of-concept in the lab, to TRL 6 (validated prototype in a relevant environment).

A spin-out company, Gurung Fuel, led by the industry partners has been created to lead commercialization, stakeholder engagement and capital raising.

“This partnership is a major step towards scaling the cutting-edge electrolyzer technology. We're not just developing a solution, we are creating a game-changer for the aviation industry, with the potential to make a global impact,” Yun said.

The research project is a strategic opportunity for Australia, which is facing a critical challenge in its fuel security.

“We've also added a nitrogen-reduction offer that pays an additional $4 per acre.” The Bayer Carbon Program contract is for five years.
Inset programs The Soil and Water Outcomes Fund (SWOF) is an inset program that works with public and private organizations to achieve sustainability goals.
So do inset programs such as SWOF and others, which pay farmers for improving water quality.","Ever wish you could be paid for the way you farm?

These days, you certainly can.

Payment for carbon and sequestering or squelching greenhouse gases to produce low-carbon fuels spurred by Section 45Z and accompanying tax credits may soon be reality. They join “offset” and “inset” programs that firms currently offer to farmers.

Offset programs pay farmers using practices such as cover crops that “offset” greenhouse gases that companies produce in manufacturing products. Inset programs occur when a firm works with its own supply chain or that of other companies to reduce a carbon footprint.

The Bayer Carbon Program has both inset and offset customers, says Alyssa Cho, Bayer sustainable agriculture field team lead. It pays farmers for sustainable practices they are already using on their own farm, such as reduced tillage or cover crops.

“We pay $6 per practice per year dating back to the fall of 2019,” Cho says. “We've also added a nitrogen-reduction offer that pays an additional $4 per acre.”

The Bayer Carbon Program contract is for five years. If a grower decides to sign up again at the end of the contract, Bayer offers another $6-per-acre bonus. Either Bayer or the farmer can exit the program before the contract expires.

Inset programs

The Soil and Water Outcomes Fund (SWOF) is an inset program that works with public and private organizations to achieve sustainability goals. It pays farmers who have implemented or expanded conservation to achieve environmental outcomes such as carbon sequestration, emission reductions and water-quality improvement.

It offers one-year contracts for practices such as:

Its average annual payout in 2024 was $33 per acre for participating farmers.

VARIETY OF PAYMENTS: Farmers can be paid for a variety of practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as reduced tillage or cover crops.

Carbon intensification scoring

What direction payments may take from Section 45Z federal tax credits hinges on regulations issued by the Treasury Department. It has not issued such regulations.

“The ethanol [biofuel] company is going to capture a lot of that value, perhaps the majority of it,” says Sean McMahon, head of U.S. sustainability for FarmersEdge. “But there's still substantial value there for farmers. There’s a premium for low-carbon grain, and that value is going to exceed carbon offsets or carbon insets based on the voluntary carbon market today.”

The tax credit’s worth is based on a carbon intensification (CI) score that tracks the biofuel supply chain’s carbon footprint. The more greenhouse gas-cutting practices a farmer adopts, the more he or she could potentially glean in payments from the tax credit passed on by the biofuel producer.

“What I love about CI scoring is it represents a snapshot of a particular crop in a particular field for a specific year,” McMahon says. He says existing carbon programs have more rigor and parameters. Some programs also nix payments to farmers who have installed previous conservation practices, he adds.

It remains to be determined what this payment plan has upon programs such as the Soil and Water Outcomes Fund, says Adam Kiel, SWOF managing director.

“Although some are saying that 45Z is locked in, we still don’t know if in-field climate-smart ag practices are eligible to count toward a fuel producer's score,” he says. “That decision is still with the U.S. Treasury Department.”

Hybrid program

Indigo Ag is already offering 45Z programs through several partnerships using interim guidance provided by USDA, says Chris Malone, vice president for Indigo Ag’s biofuels and market development.

NITROGEN MANAGEMENT: Payments also can be garnered for practices that optimize nitrogen management. (Tom J. Bechman)

“At Indigo Ag, we see 45Z as a complement to other sustainability programs, not a competitor,” he says.

Its FieldFlex program allows farmers to move eligible fields between 45Z and other programs as crop rotations and opportunities change, he says. This allows farmers flexibility to capture the best value from sustainability programs each year, Malone adds. It also allows agribusinesses and farmers the ability to monetize sustainability attributes, even if they can't take advantage of 45Z every year, he says.

Malone adds that Indigo Ag currently offers a guaranteed payment if Treasury does not implement 45Z.

No double dipping

Farmers cannot double dip payments between programs for which they are paid to slash greenhouse gas emissions in the same year, McMahon says.

However, he sees an opportunity for biodiversity payments — such as for improving water quality — to be stacked on top of payments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Farm bill components — such as the Regional Conservation Partnership Program — allow for this, McMahon says. So do inset programs such as SWOF and others, which pay farmers for improving water quality.

“You could stack a water-quality credit that pays farmers for reducing nitrate leaching on top of a Section 45Z payment for reducing nitrous oxide emissions,” he says.

Although this market is slower to develop than programs that slash greenhouse gases, interest exists, McMahon adds.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt6b1cec6ab39592f3/68824f90ffb8a05bb4b2f86d/0721F3-1623A-1800x1012-Recovered.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-07-25 12:56:41.060749

Payments shared between biofuel plants, farmers, grain merchandisers and others of $100 to $400 per acre have been batted around in recent years.
Still, it’s likely farmers will obtain something, says Monte Shaw, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association executive director.
“It’s going to be very expensive [for SAF] to break into the sustainable aviation market,” Shaw adds.
And if long-term projections for aviation industry de-carbonization hold, Shaw says SAF demand for corn ethanol could grow to a point where U.S. corn farmers — who currently grow about 15 billion bushels annually — would have difficulty meeting it.","So, how much money could farmers reap from Section 45Z tax credits gleaned by biofuel producers?

Payments shared between biofuel plants, farmers, grain merchandisers and others of $100 to $400 per acre have been batted around in recent years. Current legislation is silent about biofuel manufacturers sharing any money they garner from Section 45Z. Still, it’s likely farmers will obtain something, says Monte Shaw, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association executive director.

For example, say an ethanol plant lowers its carbon intensification (CI) score by 30 points via processing low-carbon corn and gleans 2 cents per CI point in tax credits. This tallies 60 cents per gallon, or $1.80 per bushel of corn, if the plant uses three bushels to make each gallon of ethanol.

“No one can sit here today and tell you what portion of that $1.80 [per bushel] will find its way back to the farmer,” Shaw says. “But I can say with a basis in history that we’ve never added $1.80 [per bushel] to the value of a commodity like corn where the farmer didn’t get some [additional value].”

Massive SAF market

Still, Shaw believes the most value from Section 45Z tax credits will come from using ethanol in the aviation industry’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“I think we’re missing the forest by seeing just the trees,” he says.

Over the last 40 years, average U.S. corn production has annually increased 210 million bushels, Shaw says. “That means that in 20 years, we will need a forest to chew up the [additional] 5 billion bushels of corn,” he adds.

Shaw thinks SAF could chew up this increase and more.

The airline currently accounts for 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050, says Meg Whitty, vice president of corporate affairs and marketing for LanzaJet, a sustainable fuels technology company. It’s estimated that SAF — a share of which comes from corn ethanol — could contribute about 65% of the emission reductions needed by the aviation industry to reach net-zero emissions by 2025, according to an analysis by the International Air Transport Association.

Growth potential is excellent, as SAF in 2024 represented only 340 million gallons out of a 100 billion-gallon jet fuel global market, Whitty says.

“The opportunity is massive,” she adds.

Facing hurdles

SAF fared poorly in current 45Z legislation, as Congress clipped its tax credit from a maximum of $1.75 to $1 per gallon.

“This is going to hinder the ability to turn ethanol into sustainable aviation fuel under the current version of 45Z,” says Mitchell Hora, a Washington, Iowa, farmer and founder and CEO of the software company Continuum Ag.

“It’s going to be very expensive [for SAF] to break into the sustainable aviation market,” Shaw adds. He says it will take the majority of the 45Z tax credit for SAF producers to document farm practices, increase plant operational efficiencies and replace natural gas — used in SAF manufacturing — with renewable natural gas.

ETHANOL OPPORTUNITY: New opportunities for ethanol produced in plants such as this Lincolnway Energy facility in Nevada, Iowa, could result from new markets. (Iowa Renewable Fuels Association)

However, hope exists. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, has moved to amend SAF’s tax treatment. And if long-term projections for aviation industry de-carbonization hold, Shaw says SAF demand for corn ethanol could grow to a point where U.S. corn farmers — who currently grow about 15 billion bushels annually — would have difficulty meeting it.

“When was the last time American famers had a market that wanted everything they could responsibly grow?” Shaw says. “I’m not saying that will happen, but that’s the potential size of this market.”

Politics

Still, biofuel growth is subject to political whims, says Owen Wagner, vice president of grains and an oilseeds analyst with Rabobank. “Fifteen to 20 years ago, when we were talking about grain markets, it would have been fundamentals,” he says. “Now, the growth and relative importance of biofuels requires a totally different way of analyzing markets.

“All this also has a strong political component in that it’s dictated by agricultural policy,” he adds. “We could have a future administration that shifts emphasis back to [vehicle] electrification rather than liquid fuels.”

If so, this could negatively alter the outlook for biofuels. “It all depends on what the energy priorities are coming out of D.C.,” Wagner says.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt98edeccfef4a13bb/68824a090a6c351ebcbc69a6/0721F2-1622A-1800x1012.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-07-25 11:56:26.393077

Efforts include cleaner energy, less flying, and remote work.

Formula 1 has made strong progress in cutting its carbon emissions, reaching a 26% drop by the end of 2024 compared to levels in 2018. It puts the sport more than halfway toward its goal of cutting emissions in half by 2030, with plans to offset any remaining emissions after that.

The progress was made possible through joint efforts between F1 teams, event promoters, partners, and the FIA. The changes come during a time of rapid growth for the sport, with the race calendar expanding from 21 events in 2018 to 24 in recent years. Attendance also jumped from 4 million to 6.5 million, and the global fan-base has grown to over 826 million.

According to the organisation’s latest sustainability update [PDF], if Formula 1 had not changed the way it operates, emissions would have risen by around 10% since 2018. Instead, they’ve gone down – with the 2024 carbon footprint measured at 168,720 tonnes of CO2 equivalent, down from 228,793 tonnes in 2018.

That 2018 figure was updated from a previous estimate to better reflect improved data from suppliers and align with international reporting standards. The update helps ensure that the reduction reflects actual improvements and not just changes in how emissions are counted.

Stefano Domenicali, President and CEO of Formula 1, said: “We are strongly committed to achieving Net Zero by 2030. It is a concrete goal, already visible in the significant reduction of our sport’s carbon footprint… We will continue to pursue our projects and next year we will introduce new actions, like the use of advanced sustainable fuels in all Formula 1 cars…”

Where the emissions cuts came from

Several key changes helped lower emissions in the sport:

Factories and offices: Emissions dropped by 59%, or over 34,000 tonnes, thanks to a switch to renewable energy at F1 team sites.

Travel: Emissions from air travel fell by about 20,000 tonnes, a 25% cut. The was made possible by using more remote broadcasting and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Freight and logistics: Emissions dropped by 6,438 tonnes, or 9%, by switching to newer freight containers, using more fuel-efficient planes, and running trucks on biofuels in Europe.

Race events: Emissions per race went down by 12%, as many venues began using solar power, biofuels, and greener energy sources. Total emissions for all races rose slightly due to the addition of more events.

Ellen Jones, Head of ESG at Formula 1, said: “All areas have been tasked with operating more sustainably, and it is through this sport-wide engagement and delivery that we are able to achieve such significant emissions reductions.” She added that upcoming changes to the race calendar starting in 2026 will further support this effort.

What’s next for Formula 1?

Formula 1 plans to keep investing in lower-carbon options, including:

Using more sustainable aviation fuel and expanding sea freight to cut air travel.

Creating regional hubs so equipment doesn’t need to travel as far.

Developing a 100% sustainable fuel that can also be used in regular cars, with full use expected by 2026.

Reducing the need to move large teams and gear by increasing remote production.

More than 80% of race promoters are now using some form of cleaner energy at events. Partners like Aggreko have also introduced lower-carbon systems using fuels like HVO, solar panels, and battery storage. These systems will be used at all European races from 2025.

Biofueled trucks now carry F1 equipment around Europe, cutting emissions by an average of 83%. The number of races held closer together by region has also gone up, cutting down on long-distance freight travel. In 2024, races in Japan, Singapore, and the Middle East were grouped more closely. From 2026, the Canadian Grand Prix will move to May and Monaco to June to better align with the European race season.

Other steps include:

All F2 and F3 cars now run on fully sustainable fuel, ahead of F1’s switch in 2026.

F1 medical and safety cars are already using a 40% sustainable fuel blend.

All tyres used in the 2024 season were made with rubber certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), and after races, the tyres are recycled into new materials.

The group consisted of representatives from refineries and airlines interested in SAF production, raw material procurement officials, investors and government advisors from academia.

The development of SAF technology is a priority for the South Korean government due to the rapid introduction and influence of similar policies in the European Union, Japan, the U.S. and elsewhere. The government is seeking to mandate airline fuel be blended with one percent SAF by 2027 and shows interest in corn ethanol-based ATJ technology based on abundant raw materials.

“Currently, hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) technology is the preferred method of SAF production, but ATJ’s wider range of raw materials like corn ethanol will make it a more appealing option as technology advances,” said Haksoo Kim, USGC director in South Korea.

Participants arrived in Chicago to meet with USGC SAF Consultant Mark Ingebretson and Dr. Steffen Mueller, associate director of bioenergy at the University of Illinois-Chicago, for an overview of U.S. and global SAF policy trends and life cycle modeling of ethanol-based transportation fuels. The team also visited LanzaJet, the first company to produce ATJ SAF, to discuss the opportunities and obstacles for ATJ SAF.

The delegation then traveled to Atlanta to meet with officials from major transportation players including Delta Air Lines, FedEx, Aerovida Bio, Argus and Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport to share information and exchange views on the U.S. SAF policy and industry readiness for SAF blending.

The program concluded in Sioux Falls, SD, with visits to several corn farms, ethanol plants and ATJ production technology provider Gevo to demonstrate how corn production and ethanol processing can reduce carbon. They also learned how ATJ technology, using corn-based ethanol, could surpass HEFA technology in the future.

Some offset programs contain additionality clauses, which nix payment for prior practices farmers use to slash greenhouse gas emissions.
Others contain permanence clauses that pay farmers for greenhouse gas-reducing practices for a certain duration.
Unlike current carbon programs, there’s no contract to sign, nor are farmers who have installed prior greenhouse gas-sapping practices excluded.
“This is an opportunity to pay farmers for practices they have been doing for a while,” he says.","Late in 2022, Mitchell Hora found an obscure spark that could ignite new revenues for farmers tucked inside the massive Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

“It was a light-bulb moment for me,” says Hora, a Washington, Iowa, farmer and founder and CEO of the software company Continuum Ag. While perusing the IRA, he found Section 45Z, which grants federal tax credits to biofuel manufacturers who make low-carbon fuels.

The tax credit’s worth is based on a carbon intensification (CI) score that tracks the biofuel supply chain’s carbon footprint. This includes greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane that can fuel climate change.

The fewer emissions used to produce a gallon of biofuel, such as ethanol or biodiesel, the more tax credits — and money — biofuel companies glean. Farmers play a part in reducing these emissions since the answer is literally under their feet. Soil health practices they implement — such as cover crops, reduced tillage and efficient fertilizer use — also can reduce or sequester greenhouse gas emissions.

Currently, nothing in Section 45Z states that biofuel producers must share the money from tax credits with anyone. Still, Hora thinks they will share it with farmers, grain merchandisers, third-party verifiers and others. He estimates tax credits potentially could be worth more than $100 per acre in sharable value.

“[Section 45 Z] could be absolutely game-changing for my family's farm and other family farms across the country,” he says. “I think it’s going to have a ripple effect that changes global agriculture.”

How so?

Voluntary programs that pay farmers to adopt practices to sequester or reduce greenhouse gases gained momentum in the late 2010s. One type — offset programs — pays farmers for soil health strategies to offset greenhouse gases emitted by companies making their products.

It’s not that simple, though. Some offset programs contain additionality clauses, which nix payment for prior practices farmers use to slash greenhouse gas emissions.

“If a producer switched from conventional tillage to no-till 20 years ago and picked up cover crops a decade ago, they're actually precluded from participating in a lot of these carbon markets,” says Sean McMahon, U.S. sustainability manager for FarmersEdge, a Canadian firm that provides agribusinesses and crop insurers technology services.

Others contain permanence clauses that pay farmers for greenhouse gas-reducing practices for a certain duration. A farmer who converted to greenhouse gas-sequestering no-till would void a contract if they switched to tillage, according to a University of Wisconsin Extension analysis.

“Some of these programs in a voluntary carbon [offset] market have a lot of red tape and hurdles,” Hora says.

That’s not so with potential Section 45Z payments. Unlike current carbon programs, there’s no contract to sign, nor are farmers who have installed prior greenhouse gas-sapping practices excluded.

Instead, potential payments are tied to the carbon footprint of each bushel a farmer grows, Hora says. The lower a farmer’s CI score, the higher the payments.

This appeals to Josh Nelson, who farms near Belmond, Iowa.

“This is an opportunity to pay farmers for practices they have been doing for a while,” he says. “Under [Section] 45Z, you could potentially get a payment for soil health practices that improve your CI score.”

All this ties into hungry global demand for low-carbon fuels, says Monte Shaw, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association executive director.

“Almost every major market that we see requires low-carbon ethanol,” he says. “The aviation industry wants it. Marine vessel fleets want it. The railroad industry wants locomotives that can generate electricity from low-carbon ethanol instead of diesel fuel.”

Biofuel win

Section 45Z was a winner in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed on July 4. Provisions include:

an extension of biofuel tax credits through 2029 (Initially, they were set to expire in 2027.)

a mandate that tax credits apply only to North American feedstocks such as corn and soybeans (It excludes foreign feedstocks, such as those used to make Chinese cooking oil.)

tax credit transferability (This allows biofuel producers to sell credits they can't directly use.)

ADDITIONAL REVENUE: Although corn prices are depressed due to a monster crop on the way, carbon intensification scoring under Section 45Z may unlock new revenue opportunities for farmers.

Congress also eliminated a part of the full life-cycle analysis within Section 45Z called indirect land use change (ILUC). This modeling method calculates how potential changes in economic demand for a crop affects global land use, says Karen Boyd, World Energy director of product sustainability. She says it’s important to remember that ILUC is just an economic model based on possible changes in future demand and cannot be directly measured or affected by an individual.

“If you grow soybeans, [45Z-induced production] may create additional demand for soybean oil due to it being utilized to produce fuel,” Boyd says.

ILUC modeling shows how this potential fuel use may impact land use for other soybean uses. It may mean land demand to grow soybeans for food and other purposes could come from areas such as a Brazilian rain forest converted into new farmland, she says.

CI scoring specifics

CI scoring works on a sliding scale for fuel, grain and oilseeds. Average CI scores include:

gasoline: 100

ethanol: 55

corn: 29.1

Biofuels companies could earn a 2-cent-per-CI-point reduction per gallon under the Section 45Z tax credit, Shaw says.

Nixing the ILUC alone will reduce the CI score for a typical Midwestern ethanol plant from 55 to 45, Shaw says. If combined with a 10-cent-per-gallon tax credit, an ethanol plant that annually produces 100 million gallons of ethanol could glean $10 million. Plants could use this money to pay farmers and others, upgrade capacity or make plant improvements.

“With these changes, I think the vast majority of ethanol plants are going to be able to qualify for the tax credits,” Shaw says.

Meanwhile, corn producers can lower their 29.1 CI score through various greenhouse gas-slashing practices. Nelson has lowered his CI score for corn to 5 by:

planting cover crops on a share of his acres

strip-tilling and no-tilling corn

implementing a three-crop rotation including corn, soybeans and small grains (oats/rye)

reducing nitrogen application to approximately 0.6 pounds per bushel for corn

applying hog manure as a nutrient source

improving fertilizer management using soil tests such as one for pre-sidedressed soil nitrate

Unknowns

Still, many unknowns exist, as Section 45Z now goes to the Treasury Department’s Internal Revenue Service to write regulations. The Treasury Department may consult with USDA and the Department of Energy, which were previously involved with Section 45Z provisions. Since it’s a tax issue, however, the Treasury Department has final say.

“Without final Treasury regulations, it’s difficult to predict exactly how farmers will benefit,” Shaw says.

Shaw believes the Treasury Department will create a pathway for farmers to receive individualized CI scores for low-carbon practices. Questions remain about what practices will be included and what model will be used to track these.

“USDA [under the Biden administration] didn’t recognize manure, and that’s one of the biggest [low-carbon] practices you can do,” Shaw says.

Monetization by farmers also remains uncertain. Much depends on how the Treasury Department tracks CI credits, Shaw says. The current draft uses mass balance, which links bushels and low-carbon credits for delivery to a biofuel producer.

“We have said from the beginning that mass balance is a mistake,” Shaw says. “It lumps corn [and other crops] together. Unless you’re selling directly to the plant, it is very limiting.”

The book-and-claim tracking system, which separates bushels and low-carbon credit certification, is better, Shaw says. It would enable farmers to separately sell their environmental attributes from their own CI scores from their grain and oilseed bushels.

CARBON SEQUESTRATION. Deep-rich soils hold the answer for sequestering greenhouse gases.

“If I'm 400 miles away from the nearest ethanol plant but can raise low-carbon corn, I could sell that credit to the ethanol plant,” Shaw says. “Book-and-claim would give every farmer a chance to participate and enlarge the ability to produce low-carbon ethanol.”

Other concerns

Extending the 45Z tax credit from 2027 to 2029 also was a win, Shaw says. Still, it dashed hopes for a 2031 extension. “This credit [through 2029] is not long enough for a plant to finance, build and operationalize major projects,” Shaw says.

Unless the credit is extended past 2029, biofuel plant managers will closely scrutinize and may pass on major investments, he adds.

ILEC also hasn’t gone away completely, Boyd says.

“It’s still part of other CI calculations that fuel producers’ value, such as California's [low-carbon fuel standard] or [Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation],” Boyd says. “Depending on the policy that is used to value the fuel, [ILUC] still is applicable.”

What to do

Hora hopes book-and-claim tracking will prevail. For now, though, he advises farmers, biofuel producers, grain merchandisers, elevators and other supply chain members to ready themselves for linked data and crop under mass balance tracking. This requires knowing the CI scores of the grain and verifying bushels at every point of aggregation.

“Every single step along the chain will undergo an audit,” Hora says.

If you want to know your CI score, Continuum Ag offers CI scoring. Iowa State University also offers a CI score calculator.

Knowing their CI score can help farmers decide which future low-carbon opportunities to pursue, says Eric Gibson, farm input and crop production sustainability analyst for Rabobank.

“You can only improve what you can measure,” he says.

Be careful. “Practices like cover crops are not inexpensive to implement,” says Tim Laatsch, North America director of agronomy for Koch Agronomic Services. “They carry some benefits, but they take time to materialize. They come with a learning curve, and some yield penalty if you aren't managing at a high level.”

Long term, however, Nelson sees the movement toward carbon intensification and low-carbon grains and oilseeds as a lasting trend. “You see Nestle, Unilever and European companies interested in paying farmers for their data to meet their [environmental, social and governance] goals,” he says. “Companies in Asia are also looking at their own ESG models. The idea of climate change or carbon removal is kind of off limits right now politically [in the U.S.], but I don't think it's going away globally.”

POTENTIAL BOOMING MARKET: Corn might be part of a future booming market due to its use in sustainable aviation fuel. However, reaching this market first will require leaping a few hurdles.

So, how much money could farmers reap from Section 45Z tax credits gleaned by biofuel producers?

Payments shared between biofuel plants, farmers, grain merchandisers and others of $100 to $400 per acre have been batted around in recent years. Current legislation is silent about biofuel manufacturers sharing any money they garner from Section 45Z. Still, it’s likely farmers will obtain something, says Monte Shaw, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association executive director.

For example, say an ethanol plant lowers its carbon intensification (CI) score by 30 points via processing low-carbon corn and gleans 2 cents per CI point in tax credits. This tallies 60 cents per gallon, or $1.80 per bushel of corn, if the plant uses three bushels to make each gallon of ethanol.

“No one can sit here today and tell you what portion of that $1.80 [per bushel] will find its way back to the farmer,” Shaw says. “But I can say with a basis in history that we’ve never added $1.80 [per bushel] to the value of a commodity like corn where the farmer didn’t get some [additional value].”

Massive SAF market

Still, Shaw believes the most value from Section 45Z tax credits will come from using ethanol in the aviation industry’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“I think we’re missing the forest by seeing just the trees,” he says.

Over the last 40 years, average U.S. corn production has annually increased 210 million bushels, Shaw says. “That means that in 20 years, we will need a forest to chew up the [additional] 5 billion bushels of corn,” he adds.

Shaw thinks SAF could chew up this increase and more.

The airline currently accounts for 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050, says Meg Whitty, vice president of corporate affairs and marketing for LanzaJet, a sustainable fuels technology company. It’s estimated that SAF — a share of which comes from corn ethanol — could contribute about 65% of the emission reductions needed by the aviation industry to reach net-zero emissions by 2025, according to an analysis by the International Air Transport Association.

Growth potential is excellent, as SAF in 2024 represented only 340 million gallons out of a 100 billion-gallon jet fuel global market, Whitty says.

“The opportunity is massive,” she adds.

Facing hurdles

SAF fared poorly in current 45Z legislation, as Congress clipped its tax credit from a maximum of $1.75 to $1 per gallon.

“This is going to hinder the ability to turn ethanol into sustainable aviation fuel under the current version of 45Z,” says Mitchell Hora, a Washington, Iowa, farmer and founder and CEO of the software company Continuum Ag.

“It’s going to be very expensive [for SAF] to break into the sustainable aviation market,” Shaw adds. He says it will take the majority of the 45Z tax credit for SAF producers to document farm practices, increase plant operational efficiencies and replace natural gas — used in SAF manufacturing — with renewable natural gas.

ETHANOL OPPORTUNITY: New opportunities for ethanol produced in plants such as this Lincolnway Energy facility in Nevada, Iowa, could result from new markets. (Iowa Renewable Fuels Association)

However, hope exists. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, has moved to amend SAF’s tax treatment. And if long-term projections for aviation industry de-carbonization hold, Shaw says SAF demand for corn ethanol could grow to a point where U.S. corn farmers — who currently grow about 15 billion bushels annually — would have difficulty meeting it.

“When was the last time American famers had a market that wanted everything they could responsibly grow?” Shaw says. “I’m not saying that will happen, but that’s the potential size of this market.”

Politics

Still, biofuel growth is subject to political whims, says Owen Wagner, vice president of grains and an oilseeds analyst with Rabobank. “Fifteen to 20 years ago, when we were talking about grain markets, it would have been fundamentals,” he says. “Now, the growth and relative importance of biofuels requires a totally different way of analyzing markets.

“All this also has a strong political component in that it’s dictated by agricultural policy,” he adds. “We could have a future administration that shifts emphasis back to [vehicle] electrification rather than liquid fuels.”

If so, this could negatively alter the outlook for biofuels. “It all depends on what the energy priorities are coming out of D.C.,” Wagner says.

SOIL-SMART PAYMENTS: These days, farmers can glean more payments for crops such as corn through payments for practices that sequester or slash greenhouse gases.

Ever wish you could be paid for the way you farm?

These days, you certainly can.

Payment for carbon and sequestering or squelching greenhouse gases to produce low-carbon fuels spurred by Section 45Z and accompanying tax credits may soon be reality. They join “offset” and “inset” programs that firms currently offer to farmers.

Offset programs pay farmers using practices such as cover crops that “offset” greenhouse gases that companies produce in manufacturing products. Inset programs occur when a firm works with its own supply chain or that of other companies to reduce a carbon footprint.

The Bayer Carbon Program has both inset and offset customers, says Alyssa Cho, Bayer sustainable agriculture field team lead. It pays farmers for sustainable practices they are already using on their own farm, such as reduced tillage or cover crops.

“We pay $6 per practice per year dating back to the fall of 2019,” Cho says. “We've also added a nitrogen-reduction offer that pays an additional $4 per acre.”

The Bayer Carbon Program contract is for five years. If a grower decides to sign up again at the end of the contract, Bayer offers another $6-per-acre bonus. Either Bayer or the farmer can exit the program before the contract expires.

Inset programs

The Soil and Water Outcomes Fund (SWOF) is an inset program that works with public and private organizations to achieve sustainability goals. It pays farmers who have implemented or expanded conservation to achieve environmental outcomes such as carbon sequestration, emission reductions and water-quality improvement.

It offers one-year contracts for practices such as:

reduced till and no-till

extended crop rotations

cover crops

Its average annual payout in 2024 was $33 per acre for participating farmers.

VARIETY OF PAYMENTS: Farmers can be paid for a variety of practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as reduced tillage or cover crops.

Carbon intensification scoring

What direction payments may take from Section 45Z federal tax credits hinges on regulations issued by the Treasury Department. It has not issued such regulations.

“The ethanol [biofuel] company is going to capture a lot of that value, perhaps the majority of it,” says Sean McMahon, head of U.S. sustainability for FarmersEdge. “But there's still substantial value there for farmers. There’s a premium for low-carbon grain, and that value is going to exceed carbon offsets or carbon insets based on the voluntary carbon market today.”

The tax credit’s worth is based on a carbon intensification (CI) score that tracks the biofuel supply chain’s carbon footprint. The more greenhouse gas-cutting practices a farmer adopts, the more he or she could potentially glean in payments from the tax credit passed on by the biofuel producer.

“What I love about CI scoring is it represents a snapshot of a particular crop in a particular field for a specific year,” McMahon says. He says existing carbon programs have more rigor and parameters. Some programs also nix payments to farmers who have installed previous conservation practices, he adds.

It remains to be determined what this payment plan has upon programs such as the Soil and Water Outcomes Fund, says Adam Kiel, SWOF managing director.

“Although some are saying that 45Z is locked in, we still don’t know if in-field climate-smart ag practices are eligible to count toward a fuel producer's score,” he says. “That decision is still with the U.S. Treasury Department.”

Hybrid program

Indigo Ag is already offering 45Z programs through several partnerships using interim guidance provided by USDA, says Chris Malone, vice president for Indigo Ag’s biofuels and market development.

NITROGEN MANAGEMENT: Payments also can be garnered for practices that optimize nitrogen management. (Tom J. Bechman)

“At Indigo Ag, we see 45Z as a complement to other sustainability programs, not a competitor,” he says.

Its FieldFlex program allows farmers to move eligible fields between 45Z and other programs as crop rotations and opportunities change, he says. This allows farmers flexibility to capture the best value from sustainability programs each year, Malone adds. It also allows agribusinesses and farmers the ability to monetize sustainability attributes, even if they can't take advantage of 45Z every year, he says.

Malone adds that Indigo Ag currently offers a guaranteed payment if Treasury does not implement 45Z.

No double dipping

Farmers cannot double dip payments between programs for which they are paid to slash greenhouse gas emissions in the same year, McMahon says.

However, he sees an opportunity for biodiversity payments — such as for improving water quality — to be stacked on top of payments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Farm bill components — such as the Regional Conservation Partnership Program — allow for this, McMahon says. So do inset programs such as SWOF and others, which pay farmers for improving water quality.

“You could stack a water-quality credit that pays farmers for reducing nitrate leaching on top of a Section 45Z payment for reducing nitrous oxide emissions,” he says.

Although this market is slower to develop than programs that slash greenhouse gases, interest exists, McMahon adds.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/bltf6c509b0025215bf/68824a0affb8a0266cb2f817/0721F1-1621A-1800x1012.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-07-25 09:56:13.115442

The initiative also aims to attract investment for new SAF plants and boost the UK’s cleaner fuel supply to the aviation sector.

International Collaboration to Deliver NextGen-SAF

The project, titled NextGen-SAF, will be delivered by a consortium including:

Fuel Cell Energy (US)

Green Lizard Technologies (UK)

Drax Power (UK)

IMI Vivo (Italy)

Gardner Consulting (UK)

Leeds Bradford Airport (UK)

It has received letters of support from Airbus, Boeing, City of Doncaster Council, and Qatar Airways.

New Production Pathway: Power to Liquid (PtL)

Unlike traditional SAF production, which relies on bio or waste feedstocks, Sheffield’s technology removes this dependency. The new method, known as Power to Liquid (PtL), combines:

Renewable electricity to generate hydrogen

Carbon dioxide captured from the air or industrial processes

The hydrogen and CO₂ are then synthesised into hydrocarbons, which are refined into sustainable aviation fuel. This process not only decarbonises fuel production but could also support industrial applications.

Demonstration Plant to Combine World-First Technologies

The NextGen-SAF project will build a world-first demonstration plant integrating:

A Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) — to produce hydrogen and capture carbon dioxide

An Advanced Fischer-Tropsch (AFT) reactor — to convert the gases into hydrocarbons

The goal is to showcase the system’s reliability and operability, proving its potential for large-scale SAF production.

A Major Step for UK’s Green Fuel Capabilities

Professor Koen Lamberts, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sheffield, said:

“We are proud to lead this project, made possible by this vital funding, to develop a new and innovative SAF production pathway.

Sustainable aviation fuel is essential to reducing emissions from the aviation industry, and through this project we are taking a major step toward scaling up SAF production right here in the UK.”

Government Backs Innovation and Green Jobs

During his announcement of £63 million in SAF project funding across 17 initiatives, Aviation Minister Mike Kane said:

“This £63 million is lift-off for Britain's green aviation revolution.

From the labs of Sheffield to the runways of the future – this is how we kickstart economic growth, secure energy independence, and make Britain a clean energy superpower.”

Recent figures show that IAG, the parent company of British Airways, made substantial progress in using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), outpacing all U.S. passenger airlines combined. In 2024, this company reported an impressive consumption of 55 million gallons of this environmentally friendly jet fuel, derived from lower-emission sources, including repurposed cooking oils.

The Push Towards Sustainability

As >airlines strive to reduce their carbon footprints, the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel has become a crucial component of their emission-reduction strategies. This transition not only aims to meet regulatory requirements but also responds to growing consumer demand for environmentally responsible practices. Even so, many airlines face a slew of challenges, including high costs and limited availability of SAF.

Current Developments in the Aviation Sector

The aviation industry finds itself in a critical juncture where innovation meets necessity. Airlines worldwide are seeking greener alternatives to traditional fossil fuels, steering towards sustainable options amidst rising awareness of climate change. Despite these advances, the complexities surrounding SAF utilization present obstacles that companies must navigate.

Challenges in SAF Implementation

Although many airlines have publicly committed to sustainability, the reality often doesn’t match the vision. The production of SAF is currently lower than needed, meaning airlines can’t fully depend on it to meet their sustainability goals. Additionally, the economic implications of switching fuels can be daunting, as SAF typically costs more than conventional jet fuel. This financial barrier can affect operational budgets and pricing strategies across the board.

Cost and Infrastructure Hurdles

The fallout from transitioning to SAF also extends to logistics. The aviation sector’s reliance on traditional fuels impacts the entire transport logistics chain, and finding ways to integrate SAF effectively while maintaining efficiency is no small feat. Investments in infrastructure to accommodate SAF and ensure quality control amplify these logistics complexities.

The large-scale commercialization of SAF is widely recognized as a cornerstone in the global effort to de-fossilize air transportation. The industry, political bodies, and the scientific community are all committed to accelerating the development and widespread adoption of these crucial fuels. Tim Böltken, Founder and Managing Director of INERATEC, emphasized the dynamic nature of this field. ""This is a fast-developing field. The start-up of ERA ONE early June 2025 is an important signal from INERATEC and we aim to stay a key player in the growing e-SAF market,"" Böltken stated. He further added, ""Having an experienced partner like Sasol Chemicals is a hugely important aspect for our ambitions.""

The foundation of Sasol’s benchmark catalysts lies in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, a process discovered and patented a century ago in 1925 by German chemical scientists Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch. Sasol has been at the forefront of developing this process as a proprietary technology since the 1950s, establishing itself as a world leader in the field.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-25 09:56:32.941589

Looking ahead to Q3, Valero expects ethanol production to remain steady at 4.6 million gallons per day.
For the full year 2025, sales from the renewable diesel segment are projected to reach around 1.1 billion gallons.","Valero Energy Corp. released its financial results for the second quarter on July 24, reflecting mixed outcomes across its Renewable Energy segments. While the ethanol business remained profitable, earnings saw a significant decline compared to the same period last year. Meanwhile, the renewable diesel segment reported a notable loss. On a positive note, the company’s new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) unit is now fully operational and performing effectively.

The ethanol segment posted an operating income of $54 million for Q2 2025, marking a steep drop from $105 million recorded in Q2 2024. Ethanol production levels held steady, averaging 4.6 million gallons per day. Despite the reduced earnings, this segment continues to generate profits and remains a stable contributor to Valero’s overall business.

Conversely, the renewable diesel segment, operated through the Diamond Green Diesel (DGD) joint venture, reported an operating loss of $79 million in the second quarter. This represents a sharp downturn from the $112 million operating income reported during the same quarter last year. Sales volumes for renewable diesel averaged approximately 2.7 million gallons per day, indicating a dip in both output and financial returns.

DGD’s latest SAF initiative at its Port Arthur facility in Texas became fully functional in January 2025. This project allows for the conversion of up to 50% of the plant’s current annual production capacity of 470 million gallons into SAF. According to Eric Fischer, Valero’s Senior Vice President of Product Supply, Trading, and Wholesale, the SAF unit is operating efficiently. He highlighted that both logistics and the blending of SAF with jet fuel have been smooth, and the integration into Valero’s Jet Fuel infrastructure has proven successful.

However, Fischer acknowledged a slower-than-anticipated market uptake for SAF, especially among airlines. He suggested that industry players are still evaluating the market dynamics. Nevertheless, Fischer remains optimistic, predicting that demand may increase in the latter half of the year, particularly in response to SAF mandates coming into effect across Europe.

Looking ahead to Q3, Valero expects ethanol production to remain steady at 4.6 million gallons per day. For the full year 2025, sales from the renewable diesel segment are projected to reach around 1.1 billion gallons. This projection reflects a conservative estimate, taking into account lower production driven by current economic conditions.

Despite challenges in certain segments, Valero reported a net income attributable to its shareholders of $714 million, or $2.28 per share, for Q2 2025. This is down from $880 million, or $2.71 per share, recorded in the same quarter last year, indicating an overall decline in earnings.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-25 09:56:46.893371

USDA will vacate and return to the General Services Administration the South Building, Braddock Place, and the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, and revisit utilization and functions in the USDA Whitten Building, Yates Building, and the National Agricultural Library.","U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins today announced the reorganization of the USDA, refocusing its core operations to better align with its founding mission of supporting American farming, ranching, and forestry.

Over the last four years, USDA’s workforce grew by 8%, and employees’ salaries increased by 14.5% - including hiring thousands of employees with no sustainable way to pay them. This all occurred without any tangible increase in service to USDA’s core constituencies across the agricultural sector. USDA’s footprint in the National Capital Region (NCR) is underutilized and redundant, plagued by rampant overspending and decades of mismanagement and costly deferred maintenance. President Trump has made it clear government needs to be scrutinized, and after this thorough review of USDA, the results show a bloated, expensive, and unsustainable organization.

To be clear, all critical functions of the Department will continue uninterrupted. For example, we are at the height of fire season, and to date, have not only exceeded hiring goals, but have preserved the ability to continue to hire. Earlier this year, Secretary Rollins issued a Secretarial Memorandum exempting National Security and Public Safety positions from the federal hiring freeze. These 52 position classifications carry out functions that are critical to the safety and security of the American people, our national forests, and the inspection and safety of the Nation’s agriculture and food supply system. These positions will not be eliminated. However, employees may be subject to relocation.

“American agriculture feeds, clothes, and fuels this nation and the world, and it is long past time the Department better serve the great and patriotic farmers, ranchers, and producers we are mandated to support. President Trump was elected to make real change in Washington, and we are doing just that by moving our key services outside the beltway and into great American cities across the country,” said Secretary Rollins. “We will do so through a transparent and common-sense process that preserves USDA’s critical health and public safety services the American public relies on. We will do right by the great American people who we serve and with respect to the thousands of hardworking USDA employees who so nobly serve their country.”

The reorganization consists of four pillars:

Ensure the size of USDA’s workforce aligns with available financial resources and agricultural priorities

Bring USDA closer to its customers

Eliminate management layers and bureaucracy

Consolidate redundant support functions

To bring USDA closer to the people it serves while also providing a more affordable cost of living for USDA employees, USDA has developed a phased plan to relocate much of its Agency headquarters and NCR staff out of the Washington, D.C. area to five hub locations. The Department currently has approximately 4,600 employees within the National Capital Region (NCR). This Region has one of the highest costs of living in the country, with a federal salary locality rate of 33.94%. In selecting its hub locations, USDA considered where existing concentrations of USDA employees are located and factored in the cost of living. Washington, D.C. will still hold functions for every mission area of USDA at the conclusion of this reorganization, but USDA expects no more than 2,000 employees will remain in the NCR.

USDA will vacate and return to the General Services Administration the South Building, Braddock Place, and the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, and revisit utilization and functions in the USDA Whitten Building, Yates Building, and the National Agricultural Library. The George Washington Carver Center will also be utilized until space optimization activities are completed. These buildings have a backlog of costly deferred maintenance and currently are occupied below the minimum set by law. For example, the South Building has approximately $1.3 billion in deferred maintenance and has an average daily occupancy of less than 1,900 individuals for a building that can house over 6,000 employees.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/USDA_July25_ab31c1341a.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 00:56:12.881972

Laying the groundwork for future aircraft Neumann mentioned that many customers and operators engaged with Deutsche Aircraft at the Paris Air Show.","Although the aerospace industry often focuses on big names such as Boeing and Airbus, quieter developments are happening in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany, home to aircraft manufacturer Deutsche Aircraft.

The company is gaining media attention with its D328eco aircraft, a new-generation turboprop designed for fuel efficiency and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) capability. Beyond sustainability, the aircraft targets a strategic niche, namely replacing aging regional turboprop fleets and addressing connectivity gaps between smaller cities and major hubs.

According to Eurostat data extracted in June 2025, intra-EU and domestic transport shares in 2024 were 36.3% and 14.3%, respectively. This underscores the ongoing demand for regional turboprop connectivity – a market that Deutsche Aircraft intends to tap with the D328eco and its future models.

At the Paris Air Show 2025, AeroTime sat down with Deutsche Aircraft CEO Nico Neumann to discuss the German manufacturer’s plans to make an impact on the regional aviation market.

What sets D328eco apart

Neumann explained that the D328eco turboprop builds upon the original Dornier 328 design, incorporating significant upgrades. The fuselage has been extended by 2.1 meters to accommodate 40 passengers, up from 33 in the original model. It is powered by a new Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127XT engine and features the latest Garmin G5000 avionics suite. Neumann noted that these modifications make the aircraft “unique”.

The decision to develop the D328eco with 40-seat capacity was chosen based on market research targeting the replacement of aging 30- to 36-seat aircraft, aligning with current demand.

“No one wants to downsize when replacing an aircraft, but we also looked at how we don’t get too big that we are in competition,” Neumann said. “To serve that market, using 40 seats was the ideal solution.”

Neumann noted that some markets are more suitable for the aircraft. He said that while he wouldn’t limit its use to any specific area, the D328eco is especially well-suited for places with underdeveloped infrastructure, such as northern Canada, Australia, and some parts of Africa.

“We have a global team and 46 nationalities on board. We have a global supply chain, and we like to deliver a global product, so we are not limited to any market,” he said.

Three market pillars behind D328eco

Neumann pointed out that, to his knowledge, there is currently no other turboprop program being developed specifically for the regional turboprop market targeting 40-seat aircraft, making this market niche unique at present.

He categorized the industry into three main pillars. The first pillar is the replacement market. Neumann noted that many older aircraft in this category, such as the Saab 340 and Dornier 328, are now over 30 years old and are in need of replacement.

He highlighted that the D328eco distinguishes itself from these older models by being more cost-efficient, offering better fuel efficiency, providing greater passenger comfort, and ensuring higher operational flexibility.

The second pillar focuses on the growth market, with India being a key example. With ongoing airport expansions in India, there is a demand for aircraft that can connect smaller airports to major hubs. Neumann suggested that the D328eco’s size and capabilities make it a “perfect fit” for this purpose.

The third pillar is influenced by current geopolitical demands and involves multi-mission applications, such as search and rescue, border control, troop transport, and paratrooper deployment. The company is actively developing solutions to meet the needs of this segment as well.

How practical is SAF in turboprop aviation?

According to Neumann, once the D328eco receives certification, it will be allowed to run on anything from 100% standard kerosene to 100% SAF. This indicates that various fuel mixtures are feasible – for instance, the aircraft could be operated with 50% or 70% SAF.

However, sustainability wasn’t the sole factor for the German turboprop manufacturer in selecting the D328eco for development. Neumann explained that the aircraft is primarily designed to be economical, consuming less fuel, which is cost-effective and environmentally friendly.

“The first target of our engineers is always to reduce the fuel flow, to get it as efficient as possible, and then combine it with new technologies which are available on the fuel side,” he said.

Neumann also pointed out that the necessary infrastructure and industrial capacity to generate sufficient SAF have not yet been established. However, the company is considering future fuel options that will be significant in the next 50 years.

“I believe that, as an industry, we view SAF as the most promising solution based on power-to-liquid processes without aromatics, which will have the greatest positive impact on the climate while balancing cost efficiency with practicality,” he said.

Countdown to certification and airline entry

In discussing the major milestones leading up to the D328eco’s readiness for airline operations, Neumann highlighted several parallel steps in the process.

On May 28, 2025, Deutsche Aircraft unveiled the test prototype of the D328eco, known as ‘TAC1’. Neumann stated that preparations for ground testing are currently underway as the company prepares to launch its flight test campaign, scheduled for 2026.

A second test aircraft is expected to join the program that year, and Neumann mentioned that a third aircraft may also be included. He noted that the third aircraft will be produced on the final assembly line by the end of 2025.

Starting in 2026, the company aims to begin production of the first aircraft from that line, which will serve as the third test aircraft. This aircraft will participate in the flight test campaign, with the objective of achieving certification in 2027 and entering service by the end of that year, at which point airlines will start receiving it.

Laying the groundwork for future aircraft

Neumann mentioned that many customers and operators engaged with Deutsche Aircraft at the Paris Air Show. He added that the manufacturer “received very good feedback” and its order book is “filling up quite positively”.

In concluding the interview, he emphasized that the company does not intend to become a single-product Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).

“As a normal business, we look at the future. We are building up a lot of skills and competences, and it would be a shame to lose them after one product,” he said. “I have a small team working on the concept of our next aircraft.”",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/07/Deutsche-Aircraft-CEO-Nico-Neumann-2-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 00:56:17.088216

The investment will be awarded to 17 UK companies developing SAF, and the government states that this will help position the UK as “the world leader in homegrown SAF production”.

Globally, production has failed to ramp up sufficiently, with SAF sometimes transported from its place of production to where it is then used. IATA’s director-general Willie Walsh was quoted by Reuters as saying: “The idea that you’re buying sustainable fuel and then transporting it to use in Europe isn’t the right way to do it because you’re clearly increasing the carbon footprint of that fuel as a result of the transportation costs.”

The new investment by the UK government is also linked to the recent government “greenlighting of multiple airport expansion schemes to kickstart economic growth” as part of its Plan for Change.

The companies are part of the Advanced Fuel Fund (AFF) competition which provides grant funding to first-of-a-kind commercial and demonstration-scale projects in the UK at development stages up to construction starting.

The AFF winners include a range of companies spread across the country including OXCCU Tech, which is developing a demonstration plant at Oxford Airport, as well as LanzaJet, which is building a commercial-scale plant in Teesside.

The investment means that the government has provided £198 million to date through the AFF to scale up cleaner aviation technologies. The government says that low carbon fuel production could contribute £5 billion to the economy by 2050, positioning the UK as a global hub for SAF production and enabling it to go further and faster with expansion plans.

The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) and International Air Transport Association (IATA) have both been clear about the need to quickly expand SAF production, as previously reported by Business Traveller.

Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, commented:

“This £63 million is lift off for Britain’s green aviation revolution. We’re not just backing brilliant British innovation, we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market.”

The government has introduced a SAF bill which provides the legal framework for a ‘revenue certainty mechanism’ to support the production of SAF in the UK. This helps to reduce the uncertainty around production and encourage the development and deployment of SAF.

Additionally, it supports the SAF mandate introduced in January 2025, which requires aviation fuel suppliers to blend increasing amounts of SAF into the total aviation mix. The mandate started at 2% this year, rising to 10% in 2030.

The announcement of the new funding was made at the University of Sheffield’s Energy Innovation Centre – which received £1.5 million as part of the programme.

Professor Mohamed Pourkashanian, managing director of the University of Sheffield’s Energy Innovation Centre, who is leading the project, said:

“It is fantastic to see the University of Sheffield playing a leading role in the development of sustainable aviation fuel and supporting the aviation industry in its efforts to reduce its emissions. At Sheffield, we have some of the most advanced SAF research facilities in Europe and are excited to work with partners from the industry to help them test and develop new fuels and next generation clean energy technologies.”

Andrew Symes, CEO and co-founder of OXCCU, said:

“Support from the Advanced Fuels Fund is a key step in scaling our technology. This funding enables the detailed design and construction of OX2, our demonstration plant launching in 2026, and builds on the successful delivery of OX1. It brings us closer to producing lower-cost, lower-carbon aviation fuel and supports the UK’s ambition to become a global leader in SAF production.”

Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet, said:

Solutions to diversify and strengthen global energy and fuel systems Today’s global energy mix remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels.
Renewable energy sources, like solar, wind, hydropower and biomass, are growing but not fast enough to offset the rising demand for energy.
Long-term strategies for diversifying energy sources and building resilience Long-term strategies for diversifying energy sources and building resilience To build a resilient and secure energy future, diversification must be embedded in long-term national and regional strategies.
These initiatives are not only diversifying energy sources, they’re helping redefine what resilience means in the energy sector.","The global energy transition is facing a critical challenge, balancing energy security, affordability and sustainability. In a world shaped by multiple overlapping crises, the question we must ask ourselves is: How do we create energy security and resilience through energy and fuel diversification?

The new energy reality calls for diversification

Supply disruptions, price volatility and geopolitical uncertainty are some of the critical issues the energy sector faces globally. At the same time, energy demand is set to grow significantly. There’s no quick fix or one-size-fits-all solution, but one mitigation approach is essential: fuel and energy diversification.

When energy systems depend on limited sources or suppliers, they become highly vulnerable to shocks and disruptions. Extreme weather events and geopolitical conflicts can cut off supply suddenly and send prices soaring - something the world has already experienced.

Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Europe reduced its dependency on Russian gas – cutting the share of the EU’s total energy imports from 40 percent in 2021 to 10 percent in 2024 (IEA WEO 2024). Turning to the US for imports, an outage at a single LNG terminal in Texas drove EU wholesale gas prices up more than 10 percent in 2022 (IEA WEO 2023).

Dependencies can quickly turn into vulnerabilities. The global energy crisis has shown us how fast that can happen. While some of the immediate effects began to recede in 2023, significant risk of disruption remains.

A diverse mix of energy and fuel sources and suppliers is vital for:

Security & price stability. Concentration of energy sources exposes economies to supply shocks and price swings.

Geopolitical risk mitigation. Relying on a few geographies for imports creates exposure to geopolitical risks and potential supply chain disruptions. Spreading imports across regions and investing in localized production strengthens resilience.

Climate resilience. Extreme weather threatens single-source systems. Diversified, distributed generation is inherently more robust (UNDP). IEA partly credits extreme weather for the notably faster growth-rate of energy demand in 2024.

Affordability. Over-reliance on one fuel or supplier reduces competition and amplifies price risk.

Bottom line: A diversified portfolio of energy and fuel sources, technologies and suppliers is an insurance policy in an uncertain world.

Solutions to diversify and strengthen global energy and fuel systems

Today’s global energy mix remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels. Oil, coal and natural gas still make up around 80% of energy consumption (IEA WEO 2024). Renewable energy sources, like solar, wind, hydropower and biomass, are growing but not fast enough to offset the rising demand for energy.

Looking at the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions (NZE) scenario, the energy landscape is radically different in 2050. Clean energy meets 90 percent of global energy demand, around one-third of the remaining fossil fuel demand is fully abated, around half is used as a feedstock or in other non-energy use, and the remainder is offset by direct air capture, negative emissions from bioenergy, or other forms of carbon removal technologies.

This paves the way for a system that is more sustainable, resilient and secure – and the solutions to diversify are already available and proven:

E-fuels, such as e-methanol, green ammonia and sustainable aviation fuel (e-SAF), offer alternative fuel solutions and can lower emissions for energy-intensive industries like aviation and shipping in existing infrastructure.

Renewable fuels, produced from feedstocks such as waste oils, enable emissions reductions through drop-in replacements for diesel and jet fuel.

Low-carbon fuels, such as low-carbon hydrogen and low-carbon ammonia – also known as blue hydrogen and blue ammonia - are essential transition solutions, leveraging carbon capture to reduce emissions from conventional fuel production. These aren’t just alternatives; they are viable, scalable pathways to a secure, future-ready energy mix.

But deployment is lagging. Policy uncertainty and limited access to financing are holding back progress. Despite global ambition, growth is not yet on track. Accelerating the shift will require aligning technology, policy and investment at scale.

Long-term strategies for diversifying energy sources and building resilience

Long-term strategies for diversifying energy sources and building resilience

To build a resilient and secure energy future, diversification must be embedded in long-term national and regional strategies. This means not only increasing the supply of clean power and fuels but also ensuring that energy systems can withstand shocks – from market disruptions to extreme weather. With energy demand projected to grow up to 18 percent by 2050 (McKinsey), the need for infrastructure that is scalable and sustainable is clear.

Just like a solid investment strategy, diversification is about spreading risk. That means:

Fuel variety, from different feedstock such as renewable electricity and sustainable biomass, and different fuels such as e-fuels, renewable fuels and transitional fuels with carbon capture.

Geographic diversity, through domestic generation of renewable electricity, localized fuel production and diversified import routes.

Technological breadth, including wind, solar, electrolyzers, energy storage, carbon removal technology and more.

Supply chain resilience, achieved through dual sourcing, localized production and circular materials.

However, closing the gap between today and tomorrow’s energy system will require coordinated action across government, industry and financiers. It requires robust, long-term policy to create demand certainty and lower capital risk, and it requires massive investment - estimated at ~$150 trillion by 2050 (IRENA).

Topsoe's role in energy diversification

We’re taking part in shaping a low-carbon economy through partnerships and projects that expand and diversify the fuel landscape.

By developing technologies and solutions to produce a diverse range of fuels – from e-fuels to renewable fuels to low-carbon fuels - we take a leading role in the transition toward a more resilient fuel mix.

Our collaboration with Montana Renewables is one of our many projects producing low-carbon fuels globally. Montana Renewables is leading North America’s SAF industry using our HydroFlex™ technology to produce 30 million gallons per year - with plans to scale up to 300 MGY.

We’re helping scale high-efficiency electrolysis with our SOEC manufacturing facility in Herning, Denmark, while our supply chain partnerships help localize critical clean-tech production.

We’re providing technology and engineering support for producing e-methanol for shipping and chemical industries at commercial scale in Spain. Foresta del Atlántico’s Triskelion project is expected in 2027 to start production with annual capacity of 40,000 tons of e-methanol, also known as green methanol, while capturing and using c. 56,000 tons of CO2.

Together with our partner Sasol we’ll provide G2L™ e-fuels technology for the initial built-up of the German Aerospace Center’s Technology Platform Power-to-Liquid Fuels at the Leuna Chemical Complex in Germany. It’s expected to be commissioned in late 2027 and to produce 2500 tons of e-fuels per year, mainly e-SAF, for research purposes. With €130 million of funding secured from the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV), the plant will be the largest facility for production of e-fuels for research.

We’re helping fuel Brazil’s first commercial-scale SAF plant through our HydroFlex™ and H2bridge™ technologies. Refinaria Riograndense is expected to be operational in the first half of 2028 and aims to produce 16,000 barrels of renewable diesel and SAF per day.

These initiatives are not only diversifying energy sources, they’re helping redefine what resilience means in the energy sector.

From cutting deadly air pollution near airports to boosting long-term decarbonization, two complementary policy tools offer a clear path forward for cleaner skies.

Addressing climate and air pollution from global aviation has never been more urgent. If aviation were a country, it would be one of the world’s top 10 sources of climate pollution – and demand for air travel is growing. Fortunately, two strategies – one focused on strengthening international aviation’s carbon price signal and broadening its scope, and the other on cleaning up jet fuel itself – offer powerful, complementary paths forward.

Smarter jet fuel policies and carbon markets can power cleaner aviation Share on X

The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation and targeted jet fuel regulation can work hand-in-hand to deliver near-term air quality improvements while driving long-term climate progress. With smart policy design, both approaches could be game changers.

This is the thesis of two EDF articles published last month in the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Environment Report, an agenda-setting publication that’s only issued every three years by the ICAO Secretariat. It’s an opportunity for aviation industry, advocates and other stakeholders to showcase the most pressing environmental issues.Below is a summary of EDF’s articles, but if you’d like to dive deeper you can read the full versions here and here.

CORSIA: A global framework that needs integrity to deliver

CORSIA, established by ICAO in 2016, is the world’s first sector-specific global carbon offset program. It caps emissions from international flights and requires participating airlines to offset any growth above 2019 levels using either high-quality carbon credits or low-carbon jet fuels certified as “CORSIA Eligible Fuels.”

As it enters its first operational phase (2024–2026), CORSIA has the potential to prevent up to 1.5 billion tons of CO₂ emissions by 2035. But to fulfill this promise, its integrity must be safeguarded. That means ensuring that every offset credit and alternative fuel delivers genuine, verifiable climate benefits — and that emissions aren’t “double counted” by both airlines and national governments under the Paris Agreement.

The risks of weak rules are real. If the market is flooded with low-integrity offsets or if sustainable aviation fuel claims are made without proper tracking, the environmental value of CORSIA could be undermined. Improved monitoring, reporting, and verification systems, coupled with formal government attestations to avoid double claiming of eligible fuels, could significantly enhance transparency and trust in the system.

Crucially, CORSIA must evolve beyond its current carbon-only focus. Non-CO2 effects from aviation — including contrail-induced global warming — are significant and require policy attention. Non-CO2 effects could be as great, or even twice as great, as those from CO2 alone when expressed in terms of effective radiative forcing. In the long term, CORSIA should help create meaningful price signals for the full range of aviation climate impacts, incentivizing innovation across aircraft design, operations and sustainable fuel production.

Jet fuel regulation: An immediate opportunity for health and climate

While CORSIA lays the groundwork for long-term decarbonization, a separate opportunity could deliver big wins today: regulating the aromatic and sulfur content of jet fuel.

Current jet fuels contain up to 25% aromatic hydrocarbons and significant levels of sulfur. These ingredients generate fine particulate matter (PM2.5) during combustion — pollution that not only has an indirect net warming effect, but also poses serious risks to public health, including respiratory and cardiovascular problems, and even premature death. A recent EDF study found that between 5.8 million and 16 million Americans are at risk for exposure to PM 2.5 from aviation in the vicinity of airports.

Evidence shows that reducing aromatic and sulfur content in jet fuel can significantly cut PM2.5 emissions. In blended fuels with a high share of synthetic, sulfur-free components, reductions of 50–70% in particulate emissions under certain conditions. These gains are especially pronounced during takeoff, taxiing and landing — around airports.

Public health experts are increasingly concerned about aviation-attributable PM2.5. Globally, these emissions are linked to more than 21,000 premature deaths each year. A recent reevaluation of earlier studies suggests aviation’s overall air quality impacts may be substantially greater than previously estimated. And in countries with heavy air traffic, like China, the annual toll from aviation-related PM pollution could be as high as 67,000 lives.

Cleaner fuels mean less PM 2.5, fewer contrails and a smaller overall climate footprint.

The policy path is clear: ICAO could establish international standards limiting aromatic and sulfur levels in jet fuel to levels compatible with existing safety and performance standards, much as countries already regulate diesel fuel for ground transportation. While most road diesel is now “ultra-low sulfur,” aviation fuel remains largely unregulated on these dimensions. ICAO is uniquely positioned to harmonize standards globally and maximize reductions.

And the economic case is strong. Cleaner jet fuel could raise fuel costs by just 2% or less — a marginal increase that equates to less than half a percent of operating costs for airlines. Moreover, cleaner fuels offer higher energy density, which could improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions further.

A call-to-action

The window for action is now. Global aviation emissions are rising, and the decisions made in the next few years will shape the sector’s impact for decades. Smart, targeted investments in policy design, regulatory development, and high-integrity market infrastructure can help bend the curve toward cleaner skies.

Together, these steps can reduce pollution, protect lives and bring the aviation sector closer to its long-overdue climate course correction.

Funding will be crucial in supporting the green fuels and technologies of the future, so the UK can clean up its sea travel and trade.

Awarded from the sixth round of the Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition (CMDC), successful companies will be given a share of funding to support the development of clean maritime fuels and technologies such as ammonia, hydrogen, methanol, solar and electric.

Boosting economic growth with green fuels and technologies

Investment in green fuels not only supports the decarbonisation of shipping, helping cement the UK as a clean energy superpower, it also revitalises coastal communities by growing local economies and boosting jobs and skills.

CMDC has provided over £136m funding to date to 142 organisations, as part of the wider UK SHORE funding – the government’s flagship programme dedicated to decarbonising maritime – for over 300 organisations, including 250 SMEs.

Successful projects include the installation of electric chargepoint networks across ports, including at Aberdeen, the demonstration of an electric crew transfer vessel at Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm, and the demonstration of a green hydrogen shore power system at the port of Leith.

Maritime Minister Mike Kane said: “It’s so exciting to see investment in green fuels and technologies spurring on skills, innovation and manufacturing across the UK, delivering on Plan for Change missions to kickstart economic growth and become a clean energy superpower.”

High-tech innovations from industry

Minister Kane will meet with workers from the National Manufacturing Institute Scotland during his visit to Clydeport. The National Manufacturing Institute is looking to help Smart Green Shipping scale up the manufacturing of the FastRig windsail.

Built nearby in Glasgow, the FastRig is a high-tech wing sail which can be installed onto vessels, reducing fuel use and emissions by up to 40% per annum. The project received £3.3m from the third round of the CMDC and has now been successfully deployed at sea.

“Clean maritime is a vital part of a wider mission to decarbonise transport. Advanced manufacturing is critical to enable companies to scale up novel solutions that deliver emissions reductions and allow the creation of new jobs in these industries of the future,” stated Chris Courtney, CEO of the National Manufacturing Institute.

Advancing expertise in shipbuilding and manufacturing

During the Clydeport visit, the minister will meet with Peel Ports and local workers at Clydeport’s King George V Docks.

By delivering £3m of investment to support the growing demand for handling huge wind turbine components for the renewable energy sector, Clydeport is keeping Glasgow’s shipbuilding heritage and manufacturing expertise alive, equipping it to meet the modern-day needs of the sector.

“Our recent investment in road infrastructure at King George V Dock to accommodate growing demand for handling wind turbine components, and our ongoing transformative work at Hunterston PARC in Ayrshire to support the renewables sector, demonstrate our commitment to decarbonising supply chains and enabling the transition to a greener economy,” commented Jim McSporran, Port Director at Peel Ports Clydeport.

Research hub for clean maritime operations

Building on its commitment to clean up shipping and deliver on the UK’s climate ambitions, the UK is also delivering £3.85m to the Clean Maritime Research Hub.

Formed from a consortium of 13 universities across the UK, dedicated to conducting scientific research in clean maritime, the funding will enable the hub to continue its important research, and support the installation of a liquid hydrogen facility at Durham University.

Most notably, it extended the credit through 2029, providing biofuels producers with an additional two years of investment beyond the original 2027 expiration date. While the credit still has no requirements to pass through any of the credit to farmers and feedstock producers, the OBBBA clarified key provisions related to feedstock eligibility, emissions measurement and credit calculation, which are especially relevant for U.S. farmers. This Market Intel analyzes what the changes to 45Z mean for farmers.

The Evolution of 45Z

The 45Z credit was established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 to encourage domestic production of low-emission fuels. It is not tied to a specific type of fuel or production technology; it instead bases eligibility solely on a fuel’s ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional petroleum-based fuels. This credit was created to consolidate separate tax credits for biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The 45Z credit applies to fuel produced after Dec. 31, 2024, and was originally set to expire at the end of 2027. The OBBBA extended the credit to fuel sold by Dec. 31, 2029.

The 45Z tax credit is dependent on how much the eligible fuel reduces emissions and is claimed by biofuel producers. The emissions from feedstock production through fuel combustion is estimated using the U.S. Department of Energy 45ZCF-GREET (Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Technologies) Model. The GREET model consolidates all of the greenhouse gas emissions of each step of the biofuels supply chain, dependent on things like form of transportation and farming practices, into a specific emission rate for a gallon of fuel. This emission rate becomes your carbon intensity (CI) score; the lower the CI score, the higher the tax credit. To qualify, fuels must produce less than 50 kilograms of carbon dioxide per unit of energy – half of traditional petroleum products – for a base credit of 20 cents per gallon. The fuels that reduce emissions the most can earn biofuel producers up to $1 per gallon in 45Z tax credits.

GREET scores can be lowered in various ways, including on how the feedstock was produced. For example, the standard CI score for corn is 29.1. This means traditionally produced corn as a feedstock would largely not reduce emissions enough to qualify for 45Z credits. However, by utilizing conservation methods like no-till, cover cropping or high-efficiency fertilizers that affect carbon sequestration and release from soils, you can lower the CI score. While the GREET model was updated in January 2025, the OBBBA now requires the model to be adjusted again to exclude emissions from indirect land use change (ILUC)– the conversion of grassland, forestland, etc. to cropland to produce biofuels feedstock.

OBBBA also clarified that, to qualify for the 45Z credit, eligible fuels must be produced by American-controlled firms using feedstocks sourced from North America (the United States, Mexico or Canada). This change supports a broad range of agricultural feedstocks, including corn, soybeans and other biomass-based materials, expanding market opportunities for farmers while reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The amendment was designed to prevent large imports of used cooking oil (UCO), which had more favorable carbon intensity scores as it is considered a waste product with minimal lifecycle emissions. There was also increasing scrutiny over the possibility of fraud in imported feedstocks, as some UCO may be blended with virgin oils and falsely labeled as waste to qualify for higher credits.

The OBBBA also amended 45Z and Section 6426(k) to ensure that sustainable aviation fuel producers do not receive overlapping credits and removed premiums in the credit for SAF. Before passage of OBBBA, SAF could receive an extra 75 cents per unit of carbon reduced compared to other clean fuels. Lastly, the legislation increased credits for small producers to encourage blending capacity increase.

Effect on Markets

Many anticipate that the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, especially with changes made under the OBBBA, will increase demand for domestically sourced feedstocks. While the 45Z tax credit is awarded to fuel producers, not directly to farmers, it incentivizes fuel producers to increase production of eligible fuels and thus purchase additional feedstocks, creating the potential for more stable demand and stronger prices for key commodities tied to eligible fuel production.

Renewable fuels are already a major source of demand for U.S. agriculture, particularly for corn and soybeans. USDA projects that 35% of U.S. corn production will be used for ethanol in 2025. Additionally, corn oil can be used in biodiesel production. At the same time, more than 50% of domestically produced soybean oil is expected to go into biofuels, including biodiesel and renewable diesel.

45Z Challenges

With the changes to 45Z in the OBBBA, the Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) must now rewrite the regulations and guidance for qualifying fuels. This also requires USDA to finalize (or change) the interim technical guideline for “climate-smart” practices that lower CI scores for biofuels feedstocks. USDA has largely turned away from labeling conservation practices as “climate-smart.” In January, the Office of the Chief Economist at USDA released a list of 24 possible conservation practices or combinations of practices that could lower GREET scores for biofuels. Notably, they removed the previous requirements for 40B SAF tax credits that required farmers to conduct “bundles”, set combinations, of conservation practices, which added to the complexity of qualifying for biofuels credits and vastly limiting the eligible feedstocks. However, there is still time for the USDA to alter the eligible emissions-reducing practices.

It is also important to reiterate that there is no requirement for biofuels producers to pass any of their earnings from 45Z on to the farmers who produced their feedstocks. With rising global row crop production and low-profit margins creating uncertain market conditions for farmers, additional premiums from eligible biofuel feedstock sales can make or break farm balance sheets. However, the conservation practices required to sell crops as feedstock require significant upfront financial investments if farmers are not already utilizing them. Many factors impact what conservation practices are feasible in different regions and cropping systems. Cover crops are used on less than 5% of cropland, while, reduced tillage and no-till are used on 25% and 28% of cropland, respectively. The percent of land using a combination of any is likely also lower. And in the current down crop economy, it is difficult for crop farmers to invest in new machinery and inputs that would allow more cropland to use these needed feedstock conservation practices. If biofuels producers hope farmers continue to utilize and grow these practices on farms, they must provide significant premiums for feedstocks. Without guarantees that their investments will be returned through crop premiums or credit passthroughs, it will likely be slow going to grow eligible feedstock acres, particularly with only four years before 45Z faces expiration again.

Conclusion

Even with the OBBBA changes to 45Z eligibility, there are still many needed clarifications before the credit can be used. In addition, the uncertainty on whether farmers will be compensated for lowering emissions of feedstocks and downstream biofuels may make it difficult to truly maximize the growth of biofuels, as the 45Z credit was created to do.

Regardless, biofuels producers will likely begin planning how to take advantage of this extended tax credit. If federal agencies quickly provide workable guidance for 45Z, farmers can plan for future crop years to take advantage of the expanding markets for biofuels. When bumper crops are pushing down crop prices, increasing market demand is crucial for supporting crop prices and farm income. 45Z and biofuels production, particularly with the OBBBA investments in domestic feedstocks, represents a step forward in encouraging demand for major American crops. But without clear implementation and a fair path for farmers to benefit, the full potential of the credit may fall short.",https://www.fb.org/imgz/Analysis/MarketIntel/MI-Graphics/_socialwFacebook/242960/MI_45Z_16x9.jpg,N,,2025-07-24 12:56:21.467656

The aviation fuel additives market has been well constructed, as it helps to improve the performance, efficiency, and safety of the aviation fuel by avoiding the possible issues of icing, corrosion, and microbial proliferation. Due to the persistent growth in activities related to air travel and transportation of goods, there is an increase in the need for high-quality fuel additives all around the globe. The factors that influence the market are the rising aircraft manufacturing, strict emission guidelines, and rising fuel system protection demand. Innovation in additive formulation is also leading to better friction and combustion and minimal wear of the engine. This market will also be characterized by stable growth because organizations in the aviation industry are interested in investing in cheap and long-lasting fuel solutions.

COVID-19 IMPACT

Aviation Fuel Additives Industry Had a Negative Effect Due to Market surge during COVID-19 Pandemic

The global COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented and staggering, with the market experiencing lower-than-anticipated demand across all regions compared to pre-pandemic levels. The sudden market growth reflected by the rise in CAGR is attributable to the market’s growth and demand returning to pre-pandemic levels.

The overall effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the aviation fuel additives market was greatly adverse, and this was mostly because of the plunge in air travel worldwide and the stall of fleets. Due to airline operations partially being halted, consumption of fuel drastically dropped, and as such, this directly affected the popularity of fuel additives. There were also the supply chain failures and labor crunch that hampered production activities. The pace of development of aviation fuel had slowed down as companies were busy trying to survive rather than develop. In sum, there was a very drastic shrinkage in the market during the pandemic period.

LATEST TRENDS

Multifunctional additive systems drive market growth

In the previous year, the following are some of the key trends that have defined the market for aviation fuel additives, such as the increased popularity of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)-friendly additives, technological advancement with respect to formulation, and the emergence of Asia-Pacific as a causal power. The most important of these is the trend toward multifunctional additive systems—high-end formulas that incorporate thermal stability, lubricity, anti-static, and microbial protection into one package. Such multipurpose packages make the logistics and dosing easier for airlines and facilitate the maintaining of a compatible fuel quality throughout the operating conditions and become progressively adapted to regular fuels as well as to SAF blend combinations, requiring discrete compatibility.

AVIATION FUEL ADDITIVES MARKET SEGMENTATION

By Type

Based on Type, the global market can be categorized into Deposit Control Additives, Cetane Improvers, Lubricity Improvers, Antioxidants, Cold Flow Improvers, Anti-icing, Dyes & Markers, Corrosion Inhibitors, and Octane Improvers

Deposit Control Additions: Deposit control additives aid in making sure that carbon and varnish deposits will not come into being in the fuel systems, in the injectors, or in the combustion chambers. They increase fuel consumption and continue to ensure that the engine is functioning at an optimum level by keeping the parts clean. This fraction is necessary in the aspect of lowering maintenance costs and also in order to increase the life of the engine in planes.

Cetane Improvers: Cetane improvers enhance the speed of fuel ignition, thereby leading to increased fuel efficiency in combustion and smooth engine operation. While they have been more widespread in diesel fuels, they are growing in interest in the aviation industry too, where they might find use in specialized military or hybrid engines. Their application enhances cold starting and reduces emissions.

Lubricity Improvers: Components of jet fuels contain lower sulfur levels; therefore, lubricity improvers are added to prevent wearing of components of the fuel system. The additives establish a protective cover on the metal surfaces; they reduce friction and prolong component life. In the contemporary aircraft, they play a crucial role when it comes to ensuring that the integrity of the pumps and injectors is intact.

Antioxidants: Aviation fuels are treated with antioxidants to avoid oxidation in case it causes the development of gums and other undesired residues. They prolong the life of fuel storage and keep combustion stable. This component is imperative in maintaining the quality of fuel in long-term storage and transportation.

Cold Flow Improvers: Cold flow improvers make aviation fuels more operable at low temperatures by inhibiting the formation of wax crystals. These are must-have additives in aircraft that fly in cold regions to avoid blockage along the fuel lines. They provide reliability and constant fuel delivery in freezing climates.

Anti-icing: Anti-icing chemicals are added to reduce the freezing point of water in aviation fuel to less than -40°C, which prevents the formation of ice crystals that are capable of clogging the filters and fuel lines. Their presence is instrumental to flight safety, and particularly so in cold weather flying. This makes them put in place to provide a continual fuel supply to the engine.

Dyes & Markers: Markers and dyes are applied to make the different grades of fuels in aviation have different colours so as to avoid fuel fraud. Such additives assist in fuel traceability, quality control, and regulatory compliance. They have an exorbitant significance in controlling safety and stock in the military and commercial aviation.

Corrosion Inhibitors: The corrosion inhibitors prevent rust and corrosion of the metallic parts in the fuel system. They play important roles in ensuring that fuel tanks, pipelines, and injectors are structurally sound in the long run. The segment sustains the durability and integrity of plane fuel systems.

Octane Improvers: Octane improvers enhance the knock of aviation gasoline so that it can be pushed a lot further in engine performance and can burn without pre-detonation. They are mainly applicable in piston-engine aircraft but serve the important purpose of using up the most fuel-effective and engine-saving. This segment serves the high-performance aviation and military sectors.

By Application

Based on Application, the global market can be categorized into Civil Aviation and Military

Civil Aviation: Fuel additives have become very common in the civil aviation industry; this is to increase the efficiency of the fuel, increase engine cleanliness, and abide by environmental stipulations that are stringent. Deposit control additives, anti-icing, and antioxidants are key to safe flight in changing altitudes and climatic conditions. The production of commercial air transportation and sustainable aviation fuel prompts the need for modern and multifaceted additives.

Discover more about renewable fuels in our article Can cost-effective renewable fuel come with feedstock flexibility and minimized emissions?","Fast forward to 2050, the energy landscape will look different than it does today. Energy demand is rising (McKinsey) and globally, the energy sector grapples with supply disruptions, price volatility and geopolitical uncertainty. This requires a transition toward a more diverse, resilient and sustainable energy system. For energy-intensive industries and long-distance transportation that means demand for a wide range of fuels.

In a resilient and sustainable energy system, hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, renewable fuels and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) will play a vital role.

Currently, the world relies heavily on fossil fuels, with oil, coal and natural gas accounting for approximately 80% of energy consumption (IEA WEO 2024). In the International Energy Agency’s Net Zero Emissions (NZE) scenario, by 2050, clean energy meets 90% of global energy demand, around one-third of the remaining fossil fuel demand is fully abated, around half is used as a feedstock or in other non-energy use, and the remainder is offset by direct air capture, negative emissions from bioenergy, or other forms of carbon removal technologies.

Hydrogen: The cornerstone of clean energy

Hydrogen and its derivatives, particularly low-carbon and green, stands out as a pivotal solution for the energy transition. Low-carbon hydrogen, also known as blue hydrogen, is produced from natural gas with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, while green hydrogen is generated through electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources. Hydrogen derivatives, such as ammonia and methanol, can be utilized across various sectors, including transportation, industry and power generation.

For a deeper dive into hydrogen's potential, read our article on Why green hydrogen could play a major role in powering our sustainable future and explore our hydrogen solutions.

(NASDAQ: GEVO) expands in the carbon market by selling its first carbon removal credits. A global financial and tech company purchased Puro.earth-certified CO₂ Removal Certificates (CORCs) to offset corporate travel emissions and is ready to retire immediately. These CORCs promise real and permanent CO₂ removal from the atmosphere. They also help buyers achieve their climate goals with measurable and trustworthy results.

The company’s innovative technology makes it a pioneer in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable gasoline, chemicals, and materials with low-carbon methods. Notably, it operates one of the largest dairy-based Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) facilities in the U.S. These efforts support a clean energy future and also benefit farming communities.

Gevo: Pioneering Carbon Removals with Verified Results

The press release highlights that Gevo’s CORCs provide genuine carbon abatement. Each credit corresponds to actual tons of CO₂ removed through Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). With these credits ready for retirement, buyers can claim climate benefits right away.

This sale addresses the growing demand for reliable, verifiable carbon removals. As companies want to reduce their carbon footprints, Gevo’s CORCs will provide a strong method to offset emissions, particularly from hard-to-reduce sources like travel.

The next-generation energy company is focused on renewable fuels and chemicals. Its mission has three main goals: energy security, carbon reduction, and rural economic growth.

Significantly, in Q1, Gevo recorded over 100,000 metric tons of carbon abatement, now viewed as a marketable product. This includes captured and sequestered carbon, plus emissions avoided from using low-carbon fuels.

Alex Clayton, Chief Business Development Officer for Gevo, says,

“These are real sales of credits for carbon dioxide removal that are being generated right now. Customers should feel confident in the CORCs we provide due to the rigor Gevo and Puro.earth are putting into every step of the process. We previously said that after our purchase of Gevo North Dakota that we would be selling carbon and that’s what we’re doing.”

North Dakota Ethanol Facility: A Hub for Clean Energy and Carbon Capture

Gevo’s North Dakota ethanol production facility plays a crucial role in capturing and storing CO₂. This plant produces 65 million gallons of low-carbon ethanol annually from 500 acres. Its clean fuels meet demand in areas with strict emissions targets, like Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Alberta.

Besides ethanol, the facility generates over 200,000 tons annually of co-products, such as distillers’ grains and vegetable oils, supporting a circular economy.

Permanent CO₂ Storage with Massive Potential

Gevo North Dakota has a Class VI CCS well and lease rights for 5,800 acres in the Broom Creek geological formation. This formation can store up to 1 million metric tons of CO₂ each year. Currently, it sequesters about 180,000 metric tons per year, but Gevo aims to significantly increase this amount.

The geology allows carbon to stay underground for over 1,000 years, meeting top permanence standards in the carbon removal market. With ample pore space and wellhead capacity, the facility offers long-term growth for sequestered carbon-based credits.

As already mentioned, these CORCs are certified under Puro.earth’s strict standards, ensuring they meet key criteria for permanence, additionality, and traceability. The credits are available now and can be retired immediately for verified decarbonization today—not decades from now.

Fueling the Future with Renewable Products

Gevo’s North Dakota ethanol facility is part of a bigger vision. Ethanol serves as the feedstock for many of Gevo’s downstream products, including alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) fuels and renewable chemicals. These drop-in fuels fit directly into existing infrastructure, speeding up the shift to clean energy.

By producing renewable fuel from regeneratively grown crops, Gevo seeks to change agricultural practices while enhancing the global food supply. The company supports low-carbon farming methods, sourcing feedstocks from sustainable farmers.

Instead of choosing between food or fuel, Gevo uses a “nutrition-first approach”—extracting proteins for food and using starch for fuel. This system maximizes crop value and supports health for both people and the environment.

A Systems Approach to Sustainability

Gevo’s strategy stands out due to its “systems thinking” model. Everything—from feedstock sourcing to production and carbon tracking—is designed for efficiency and transparency. It provides end-to-end monitoring through its Verity subsidiary. This ensures accurate measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) of sustainability attributes across the supply chain.

This focus on carbon intensity and life cycle impact gives the SAF giant a competitive edge in renewable energy. It also bolsters rural economies by creating jobs, enhancing infrastructure, and attracting long-term investments.

Gevo Leads the Shift: Carbon Capture as a Market Opportunity

The first sale of CORCs is a big step for Gevo. However, it’s just the beginning. The company aims to grow its CCS operations and increase carbon abatement. With strong geological resources, modern infrastructure, and proven technology, it is set to lead in carbon removal and clean fuels.

Traditionally, CO₂ has been seen as waste or used in industries like enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Gevo captures biogenic CO₂ from its operations and then stores the gas underground, keeping it safe and harmless. This method prevents emissions and turns carbon into a valuable asset through CORCs.

As per industry reports, right now, North America and Europe lead the world in CCS development. Together, they make up about 80% of all upcoming capture and storage capacity. However, other regions are beginning to catch up.

And Gevo is now helping companies offset emissions by monetizing permanent CO₂ removal. This creates a practical market solution and supports clean energy production in the U.S.

In conclusion, Gevo’s entry into the carbon removal market with CORCs underscores its commitment to decarbonization and innovation. By linking renewable fuels with certified carbon capture, Gevo delivers a reliable solution that supports both climate goals and community growth.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2342984919.jpg,N,,2025-07-24 11:56:37.619441

The facility is expected to start production by year-end with a capacity of about 61 million gallons a year, the three companies said in a joint statement.

Houston, Texas-based Par Pacific and Japanese companies Mitsubishi and ENEOS will form a joint venture called Hawaii Renewables LLC for the project.

ENEOS and Mitsubishi will create Alohi Renewable Energy LLC, which will buy a 36.5 percent stake in Hawaii Renewables for $100 million in cash. Par Pacific will retain majority ownership and lead the project’s execution and operation.

“Once fully operational, Hawaii Renewables will be the state’s largest renewable fuels manufacturing facility and is expected to produce approximately 61 million gallons per year of renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, renewable naphtha and low-carbon liquified petroleum gases”, the companies said.

The plant will initially produce up to 60 percent SAF with flexibility to process different feedstocks and “shift yields to RD based on market conditions”, they said.

“The project’s attractive capital cost, along with its operating and distribution cost advantages, are key differentiators”, the companies said.

“Hawaii Renewables will leverage Par Pacific's existing refining and logistics infrastructure and Lutros LLC’s new and advantaged pretreatment technology”.

Par Pacific says it owns and operates 219,000 barrels per day of refining capacity across four sites in Hawaii, the Pacific Northwest and the Rockies. It also has 13 million barrels of storage capacity, as well as marine, rail, rack and pipeline assets.

The Hawaii renewable fuels plant will have access to Mitsubishi’s Petro-Diamond Inc. Terminal in Long Beach, California.

“As Japan's leading energy company, ENEOS will strengthen the partnership by leveraging its historical success in fuel refining and trading across Asia-Pacific and North America”, the statement said.

Par Pacific president and chief executive Will Monteleone said, “Creating the Hawaii Renewables joint venture brings together the best of our three organizations and yields additional scale and expertise across feedstock origination, commercial optimization, and market access throughout the Pacific Basin”.

The establishment of the joint venture requires regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, the companies said.

The Hawaii project is one of two SAF projects that the United States Energy Information Administration expects to come onstream in the country this year, the other being the New Rise Reno plant in Nevada.

The Reno plant started operation early 2025 with a nameplate capacity of 38 million gallons a year.

The owner, which rebranded to XCF Global Inc. after merging with Focus Impact BH3 Acquisition Co., announced earlier this month an investment plan of nearly $1 billion over the next three years to build a global SAF production portfolio.

Four of the projects under the plan are in the U.S., including the Reno plant. The three projects still to be built is planned to each have a capacity of 40 million gallons per annum.

New Rise Reno 2 is planned to be completed 2027. Another project in Ft. Myers, Florida, will be built on a site with access to port infrastructure and is expected to be completed 2028. The third, also targeted for start-up 2028, will rise in Wilson, North Carolina, eyeing East Coast markets.

Microsoft Corp. is partnering with Sublime Systems to reduce its indirect greenhouse gas emissions through a first-of-a-kind deal to buy low-carbon cement products from the startup.

Under the contract, Microsoft can purchase up to 622,500 metric tons of Sublime’s cement over a period of six to nine years. Microsoft can claim the carbon reductions associated with that cement in its own emissions accounting, even if it doesn’t use the material itself. If Microsoft passes on buying the product, the Somerville, Massachusetts-based Sublime can sell it to local buyers but the software giant still gets to claim the carbon savings.

Sublime uses an electrochemical process that eliminates limestone, which is cement’s main ingredient and releases carbon dioxide when it’s heated up and broken down.

Microsoft’s push to build more data centers supporting artificial intelligence has driven the company further away from its goal of becoming carbon-negative by 2030. That AI expansion has helped boost the tech giant’s emissions by 30% since 2020. More than 96% of the company’s emissions are Scope 3, or indirect, and materials like cement used in data center construction make up a big share of them.

It’s Microsoft’s first time doing a deal like this for building materials, though the company and others have used the same approach for sustainable aviation fuel and renewable energy. Called an environmental attribute certificate, it allows the purchasing company to make a sustainability claim based on environmentally friendly goods – like clean jet fuel, renewable electricity or low-carbon cement – that it didn’t use directly. But these certificates often promise more than they deliver, research shows.

“Our priority, first and foremost, is always buying and installing low-carbon materials physically that are already on the market today,” said Katie Ross, Microsoft’s director of carbon reduction strategy and market development. “But the challenge is they don’t exist at the scale or in all of the locations that we need to procure today.”

The companies declined to say how much the deal is worth.

The challenges of green cement

It’s not just a Microsoft problem. Although cement accounts for about 8% of global emissions, it’s hard to decarbonize partly because construction is a risk-averse industry with thin margins and high safety standards, according to Nik Sawe, a senior policy analyst in the industry program at Energy Innovation Policy and Technology LLC, an energy and climate think tank. That means construction companies have been reluctant to take up cement alternatives developed by startups, which are cleaner but also currently more expensive and untested in the real world.

At its 250-ton-per-year pilot plant in Somerville, Sublime has reduced emissions by 90% compared to traditional cement, according to Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder Leah Ellis. Sublime will start delivering on its deal with Microsoft when its first 30,000-ton commercial plant is operational. It’s slated to be completed in 2027.

Cement is heavy, and transporting it over long distances doesn’t make sense economically, Ellis said. The deal allows Microsoft to support the scale-up of Sublime’s technology even if it doesn’t have a construction project near the startup’s plant, she added.

Do environmental attribute certificates work?

In the past, some of these certificates have supported renewable projects that would have been developed anyway, meaning they didn’t help bring additional wind and solar online as promised, studies show. Microsoft has said it plans to phase out its use of unbundled renewable energy certificates in future years.

If deals like the one the company signed with Sublime proliferate, the clean cement industry will need to prove that the certificates it is offering are verifiable and avoid carbon emissions that manufacturers would have generated otherwise, according to a 2024 report on structuring demand for lower-carbon materials co-published by RMI and Microsoft. That includes ensuring that the products’ environmental benefits aren’t double-counted, or claimed by multiple entities as a reduction on their emissions ledger.

“Checks must be in place along the way to increase confidence that every purchase of a certificate will deliver its expected outcome,” the report’s authors wrote.

For this deal with Microsoft, other customers who buy Sublime’s cement won’t be able to lay claim to its environmental benefits, Ellis said.

Analysts had expected 302.5 million euros on average in a company-provided consensus

""Our sustainable aviation fuel sales increased close to 80% quarter on quarter, benefiting from additional SAF production capacity at our renewables refinery in Rotterdam,"" CEO Heikki Malinen said in a statement.

The rise in SAF sales drove the sales volume in Neste's renewable products unit to a new quarterly record of 1,096 thousand tonnes. The unit's sales volume margin fell 5% to $361 per ton, but exceeded analysts' forecast of $329 per tonne.

""We saw positive developments in the biofuel regulation both in the US and EU, largely supporting long-term renewables demand,"" Malinen, who joined the company last year, said.

Neste shares were up 15% as of 1000GMT. RBC analysts said in a research note that the second quarter was a ""key litmus test"" for Neste's new management, adding the results boded well for investor sentiment.

However, Malinen warned that the market environment was volatile and headwinds from global trade tensions were expected to continue.

Neste has been battling an excess supply in the renewable fuels market, pressuring its sales volumes and leading to a reduction of around 510 jobs globally earlier in 2025.

Although the group said it still expected its annual sales volumes to improve from 2024, it also forecast continuing oversupply in the renewable fuels market for the year.

Malinen told Reuters that he expects the oversupply to continue in 2026 or even beyond that, depending among others on the regulation process in the European Union.

Combined with weak demand and high input costs, oversupply had made Neste cut its forecast for the renewables sales margin three times in 2024.

Operation Northern Phoenix used the former Loring Air Force Base’s runways for the first run of its five-year aviation training effort.
The two aviation companies, whose names the authority is not yet releasing, would boost the authority’s plan to bring more aerospace jobs onto the former base.
“Due to the added attention that Operation Northern Phoenix has brought to Loring, there are two national aerospace companies that are looking at Loring as a potential home for their operations,” LDA President and CEO Jonathan Judkins said.
The Loring Air Museum and the LDA last year were at odds over the hangar’s future.","Thanks to a military training program that launched in May, two national aerospace companies could be coming to northern Maine.

Operation Northern Phoenix used the former Loring Air Force Base’s runways for the first run of its five-year aviation training effort. Word of that event spread in aviation circles, and the businesses reached out to the Loring Commerce Centre.

The Loring Development Authority works to attract business, housing and jobs to Loring’s 3,800 acres. Occupants have included Brunswick-based Green 4 Maine and, most recently, the Taste of Maine Potato Chip Co. The two aviation companies, whose names the authority is not yet releasing, would boost the authority’s plan to bring more aerospace jobs onto the former base. They would also ensure a future for its airport infrastructure, including its famed arch hangar.

“Due to the added attention that Operation Northern Phoenix has brought to Loring, there are two national aerospace companies that are looking at Loring as a potential home for their operations,” LDA President and CEO Jonathan Judkins said. “One of them would use the arch hangar, and the other would use the former tactical alert hangar.”

Northern Phoenix is a collaboration of the U.S. Air Force and New Hampshire Air National Guard, Judkins said. This year, multiple C-130 aircraft used the runways for test runs in a program that will grow over the next four years to include Black Hawk helicopters and possibly B-52s.

Next year’s training is slated in June. The events will see the addition of a mobile tower and lighting system to the runway that will remain at Loring, he said. When the five years is up, the Air Force will decide whether to continue training on-site.

Besides the return of a military mission, the training acquainted many more people with Loring, Judkins said. As a result, the commerce center has drawn interest from both public and private entities, which could bring good news on the job-creation front.

“For Loring, the most important thing about this is the jobs they will bring. That’s the LDA’s primary goal, creating jobs in Aroostook,” he said.

In the last couple of years, the authority has announced plans for a quantum research facility and a $4 billion sustainable aviation fuel production plant. Combined, they are projected to add more than 2,000 construction jobs and nearly 700 production jobs.

If the two aerospace companies decide to move in, it’s unclear how many jobs they would bring, but reuse of the base’s existing infrastructure also means that taxpayer assets will be preserved, rather than left to deteriorate, Judkins said.

Built in the late 1940s, the historic arch hangar is one of only two of its kind, according to Maine author Arend Thibodeau. The double-cantilever structure was designed to house the B-36 Peacemaker.

The Loring Air Museum and the LDA last year were at odds over the hangar’s future. The museum wanted it preserved as a historical artifact, while developers said it should be used for aerospace development.

While some have said the hangar is crumbling, Judkins said it is in reasonable shape. It has a new heating system and working electricity. Renovations would be mainly cosmetic, such as cleaning, painting, repairing doors and refinishing the roof.

The concrete roof has an insulation layer topped off with a membrane, he said. The membrane is peeling and there is a hole in the insulation, but the concrete is intact. The LDA plans to adhere a waterproof resin to the concrete and insulate inside the building.

Little used since the base closed in 1994, Loring’s airport has seen a flurry of activity in recent months.

Last fall, the Federal Aviation Administration reclassified Loring as a public airport. The Department of Defense also granted the LDA a $1 million Defense Community Infrastructure Program grant. The authority will use $750,000 of that to create an airport master plan, Judkins said. The remainder will pay for an electrical assessment and planning for grid stability in case of a catastrophic event.

The authority is also pursuing acceptance into the Federal Aviation Administration’s National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems, he said. That would make Loring part of the Military Airport Program, which could bring funds to improve other infrastructure and add additional aircraft hangars.

The document explains how Syzygy’s NovaSAF™ platform provides a scalable, policy-compatible, and economically feasible solution to help decarbonize the aviation sector, according to the press release.

Trevor Best, Syzygy Plasmonics’ CEO, emphasized that NovaSAF™ is more than just a product—it acts as a catalyst for policy advancement. He noted that the white paper demonstrates how technological innovation can assist regulators and industry players in achieving climate targets while also opening up new economic prospects.

With global regulators stepping up efforts to cut aviation emissions, the demand for SAF is projected to surpass 200 million metric tons per year by 2050. Yet, current production falls short by over 120 million metric tons. NovaSAF™ aims to close this gap by transforming biogenic methane and carbon dioxide into ASTM-certified SAF through the use of light-driven catalysts and renewable electricity. This process lowers equipment expenses, utilizes abundant feedstocks, and yields strong financial returns. In many cases, it competes favorably with the cost of HEFA and, under certain conditions, can even match Jet-A fuel prices.

Importantly, NovaSAF™ complies with both SAF and eSAF (electrofuels) standards under the EU’s RED III directive and the UK’s Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO). A single NovaSAF facility produces fuel that qualifies under two separate categories: a portion as an Advanced Biofuel and the remainder as a Renewable Fuel of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO). This dual certification grants access to premium SAF markets and helps ensure the financial sustainability of investments.

The white paper also highlights Syzygy’s Rigel reactor technology, which runs on renewable electricity and avoids fossil fuel combustion. This technology, combined with the established Fischer-Tropsch process, converts biogas into a liquid that can then be hydrotreated into SAF. Syzygy’s innovation lies in integrating these technologies into a modular system that supports distributed, site-specific production.

The paper features Syzygy’s inaugural commercial project, NovaSAF 1, based in Uruguay. This plant will convert manure from 14,000 cows into 400,000 gallons (1,100 tons) of SAF annually, powered by a national grid that is more than 90% renewable. The project serves as a proof of concept for the platform’s scalability and its potential to reduce methane and aviation emissions simultaneously.

Syzygy’s approach centers on expanding SAF production through replicable projects and technology licensing, aiming to fulfill the increasing demand for low-carbon aviation fuels over the next quarter-century.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-7.png,N,,2025-07-24 14:56:30.489392

The agreement includes more than $550 billion in new investment by Japan into core American industries. The agreement also includes Japan purchasing $8 billion in U.S. goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol and sustainable aviation fuel. Japan will also immediately increase imports of U.S. rice by 75%, with a major expansion of import quotas.

“We just completed a massive trade deal with Japan,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Japan will open its country to trade on items like cars, trucks, rice, and other agricultural products.” The president also said Japan will invest $550 billion in the U.S. “at my discretion.” He added that the U.S. would receive 90 percent of any profits, although he didn’t provide further details. The White House later on Wednesday released a fact sheet outlining some of the details: https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-secures-unprecedented-u-s-japan-strategic-trade-and-investment-agreement/

Many agriculture groups in the U.S. have started to share their reaction to the news of a trade deal with Japan. “We appreciate the work that the administration has dedicated to brokering a deal with Japan, worth $2.7 billion, and we welcome today’s announcement,” says National Corn Growers Association President Kenneth Hartman Jr. “Japan is the second largest market for U.S. corn exports, and we support any effort to expand the purchase of corn and corn products, like ethanol. U.S. corn growers produce an abundant crop year in and year out, and NCGA has long advocated for increased access to foreign markets, which will support American farmers and rural economies.”

In a statement, U.S. Grains Council President and CEO Ryan LeGrand said “The U.S. Grains Council applauds the Trump Administration on this agreement with our second largest trading partner – Japan. In the 2023-24 marketing year, Japan was the second largest importer of U.S. corn; the third largest importer of U.S. sorghum; the fourth largest importer of U.S. barley; and the 9th largest importer of U.S. distillers dried grains with solubles, totaling 14 million metric tons in corn-equivalent exports or $5.95 billion. This deal is an embodiment of our countries’ longstanding partnership and includes ethanol and SAF that fits into Japan’s policies of increasing the use of renewable fuels, that include U.S. ethanol. The Council looks forward to nurturing the important trade relationship for many more years to come.”

U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) President and CEO Dan Halstrom issued the following statement as well saying that “USMEF greatly appreciates the Trump administration’s agreement with Japan, reassuring and expanding opportunities in the #2 export destination for U.S. beef and pork. In President Trump’s first term, the critical U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement was reached, returning U.S. red meat to a level playing field in Japan and restoring its position as an extremely reliable market. According to the information released by the White House, the new agreement focuses on reinforcing the long-term economic partnership between the U.S. and Japan, which for decades has delivered tremendous benefits for the U.S. livestock and meat industries and for Japanese consumers, importers and customers. USMEF looks forward to continued growth and mutual benefits, and we thank the team at USTR and the Trump administration for another agreement reached in the critical Asia Pacific region.”

Growth Energy, the nation’s largest biofuel trade association, applauded the White House and President Trump as well following the announcement of this week’s trade deals with not only Japan, but also with Indonesia, that would open new markets for American biofuels and other agricultural co-products. The trade deal with Indonesia is expected to eliminate up to 99 percent of the tariff barriers on U.S. goods – including the 30 percent tariff currently imposed on U.S. ethanol exports. As part of the deal with Japan, the White House secured a commitment to purchase $8 billion in U.S. agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, ethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.

“Ethanol exports set a record in 2024, and President Trump’s latest deals will help to ensure that American farmers and biofuel producers continue to benefit from new and growing markets in Asia,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “We commend President Trump for following through on his commitment to unleash American energy dominance and tear down unfair barriers to exports from rural America.

In each case, it found that lobbyists representing fossil fuel actors that stood to lose billions from progressive climate regulations were able to influence the Conservative government’s policy without scrutiny.

While InfluenceMap’s report looks at policies relating to the UK’s net-zero ambitions, its findings on the way the UK’s lax laws allow lobbying to be conducted in secret can be applied across sectors. The think tank is calling for reforms to address this and close the “major transparency gap”.

The secrecy around lobbying, which has been at the heart of many government scandals in recent years, is a major driver of the disillusionment in British politics.

Three-quarters of the public believe the government is “rigged to serve the rich and influential”, according to polling conducted by More in Common and University College London’s Policy Lab last year.

InfluenceMap’s findings illustrate “how inadequate and opaque lobbying rules undermine effective policymaking”, said Alastair McCapra, the CEO of the UK lobbying industry body.

He added:

“Business engagement should help to build sounder policy with better outcomes for the public, but unaccountable lobbying breeds public mistrust. This important report removes the guesswork needed to piece together what kind of lobbying is taking place.”

Weak lobbying laws

openDemocracy has previously reported extensively on the ways that the UK’s weak lobbying laws allow corporate influence to secretly shape policy.

Our investigations have now been backed up by InfluenceMap, which has found a huge gap exists between the lobbying that takes place and that which is disclosed. This means the British public often has no way of knowing who is swaying policy.

Comparing transparency rules in the UK, the European Parliament, the US, Canada and France, InfluenceMap found that the UK has by far the worst system.

Of the five, only the UK exempts lobbyists who work in-house for a company, rather than for an agency or consultancy, from registering with a statutory lobbying watchdog. Less than 15% of lobbyists working in the UK need to register because of this rule.

The firms on the register must publish a list of clients on whose behalf they have lobbied each quarter. But they do not have to publish any details about the lobbying, including whether it involved written correspondence or a meeting and what legislation or policy was discussed.

Registered lobbyists also only need to declare clients for whom they lobbied government ministers and senior officials. There is no requirement to name clients when they approached other MPs and peers, including those on select committees, or influential government advisers.

The Committee for Standards in Public Life, an independent public body that advises the prime minister on lobbying and other aspects of public office, has consistently recommended the government publish a single, searchable database of all meetings with lobbyists.

Its recommendations would expand the scope of the current register considerably, requiring lobbyists to disclose the specific policies or legislation they discussed at meetings with government ministers and special advisers.

InfluenceMap has also called on the government to take up this recommendation and address the fundamental flaws in the lobbying act by including in-house lobbyists and publishing all responses to government policy consultants as standard.

Susan Hawley, executive director of Spotlight on Corruption, said the report “starkly demonstrates how major transparency gaps in the UK’s lobbying regime are undermining the development of good climate policy.”

“We fully support their recommendations to make lobbying much more transparent and bring the UK in line with international best practice. These reforms would support more participatory and open decision-making to help rebuild public trust and ensure better decision-making, widening the evidence base for policy making and reducing risks of policy capture by vested interests,” she said.

Oil and gas licensing

In 2022, the UK government quietly dropped two criteria from its ‘Climate Compatibility Checkpoint’ after lobbying from the fossil fuel industry. The checkpoint is used to assess whether proposed oil and gas licenses align with the UK’s climate change goals.

Oil giants BP and Shell and their industry association, Offshore Energies UK (OEUK), responded to a consultation on the checkpoint by objecting to the inclusion of two key metrics for measuring the impact of fossil fuels, according to InfluenceMap’s analysis of consultation responses obtained via Freedom of Information requests.

The measures they opposed would have required the government to consider ‘Scope 3 emissions’ and the ‘global production gap’ when issuing new oil and gas licences.

Scope 3 emissions are produced during end-use and contribute the largest share of all emissions from oil and gas production, while the production gap tracks the discrepancy between planned fossil fuel production and what’s needed to limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C.

The government dropped both criteria from the final checkpoint, which instead focuses solely on operational emissions, which represent only a fraction of total emissions from oil and gas projects.

This outcome, InfluenceMap’s report notes, strongly aligns with the positions advocated for by BP, Shell, and OEUK, suggesting their lobbying efforts were successful.

The following year, the government approved 100 new North Sea oil and gas licences, which had a potential emissions footprint equivalent to Denmark’s annual output.

InfluenceMap’s report also highlights the issues around government consultations on proposed policies, pointing out that, as in this case, lobbyists typically use these to suggest amendments in favour of their clients, but their responses are not published as standard.

Similarly, unlike in the other four Parliaments InfluenceMap looked at, corporations in the UK are not required to declare their engagement on policies, how much they spend on lobbying, or which legislation or decisions they are targeting.

It highlights that this can lead to a situation in which companies make voluntary corporate disclosures that fail to capture the true extent of this advocacy. In this case, InfluenceMap found BP published a summary of its response to the checkpoint that omitted key lines of its opposition, which were only revealed later through Freedom of Information requests.

Rachel Davies, advocacy director at Transparency International UK, said:

“This report highlights, yet again, the glaring gaps in our lobbying transparency regime and the potential risks of favouring a small group of vested interests at the public’s expense.

“The UK needs to catch up to other comparable democracies and act swiftly to introduce a comprehensive lobbying register with meaningful disclosures.”

Domestic hydrogen

It is broadly agreed that, in the UK, hydrogen is not a viable solution for decarbonising domestic heating and is an especially bad alternative to heat pumps. Much of our hydrogen comes from burning gas or coal and it cannot be transported through our existing pipelines without massive and costly infrastructure changes.

This reality has been set out by different independent bodies advising the UK government.

In 2021, the Climate Change Committee warned that hydrogen had “not yet been proven at scale and should not be a cause to delay other options” such as the roll-out of heat pumps or low-carbon heat networks. Two years later, the National Infrastructure Commission said the government “should not support the roll-out of hydrogen heating” because there is “no public policy case” for its use.

As InfluenceMap’s report notes, this has not prevented the gas industry from waging a successful lobbying campaign in a bid to shore up its market position – with a clear impact on government policy.

The think tank found the industry pursued its cause in a number of ways, including setting up Hello Hydrogen, a campaign fronted by TV star Rachel Riley, to make the case for using hydrogen in homes to the public in 2022. While the campaign did not declare its funders, its director was also a director of Cadent Gas, the UK’s largest gas distribution network.

Cadent is one of the funders of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Hydrogen, which has publicly called for hydrogen to play a part in domestic heating. The APPG’s other funders include Equinor, Shell and the Energy and Utilities Alliance, a lobbying body run by Mike Foster, the former Labour MP for Worcester (home to Worcester Bosch, a major manufacturer of gas boilers).

Other fossil fuel firms and industry lobbying bodies have also consistently pushed for the use of hydrogen in domestic heating in letters to parliamentary select committees and responses to government consultations.

Ahead of last year’s general election, Centrica (formerly British Gas) wrote to the Public Accounts Committee, which examines the value for money of government projects, to call for further public investment in hydrogen for home heating. The firm had written to the Energy Security and Net Zero Committee in support of the technology less than 12 months earlier.

This industry lobbying has led to indecision and disruption on government plans. A February 2023 report by the House of Lords Committee blamed mixed messages on the effectiveness of hydrogen from the government and industry for the poor uptake of a publicly subsidised scheme for heat pumps, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create many jobs.

The lords’ report concluded:

“Hydrogen is not a serious option for home heating for the short to medium-term and misleading messages, including from the government, are negatively affecting take-up of established low-carbon home heating technologies like heat pumps.”

The UK’s heat pump roll-outs have lagged behind those of its neighbours. Just 55,000 heat pumps were installed in the UK in 2019, compared to 600,000 in France, according to a study cited in the InfluenceMap report.

In the UK, this reportedly created around 2,000 jobs and reduced emissions of CO₂ by 0.08 million tonnes (MT); in France 30,000 jobs were created and 0.84 MT of CO₂ emissions avoided.

‘Sustainable’ aviation fuel

InfluenceMap also uncovered how industry significantly influenced the government’s so-called ‘Jet Zero’ strategy for cutting emissions in the UK’s aviation industry, which is heavily reliant on fossil fuels.

Biofuels, largely made up of used cooking oils, are often suggested as an option for producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), although they are generally accepted to be worse in terms of scalability than other, more advanced fuels, and much worse than just reducing the number of flights.

The government initially proposed limiting the use of used cooking oil for SAF to alleviate competition on the resource – which is increasingly in demand for other uses, such as producing biodiesel for cars – and to encourage investment in new technologies for the aviation industry.

The proposals included two options; either banning the use of used cooking oil for SAF altogether, or rapidly phasing down its use so that it would make up just 8.5% of total sustainable aviation fuel by 2040.

But the government’s final SAF policy was more closely aligned with industry preferences than scientific warnings, InfluenceMap found. It allows used cooking oil to make up 100% of SAF uptake in 2025 and 2026, 71% in 2030, and 35% in 2040.

InfluenceMap’s analysis reveals the weakened SAF mandate came after pressure from Shell, BP, the International Airlines Group (which owns several airlines), Airlines UK (the trade body for UK-registered airlines) and Virgin Atlantic airline.

It also found that business interests were overrepresented in parliamentary meetings on SAF while the policy was being shaped.

This can be seen in the make-up of Parliament’s Jet Zero Council, “a partnership between industry academia and government”, which was run by Heathrow’s chief operating officer, while the International Airlines Group chaired the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Delivery Group.

The council comprised 24 members from industry, three from academia and one from civil society. Ministers were also directly involved with the council, with then-prime minister Boris Johnson attending the group’s first meeting along with four ministers.

Transparency failures again played a key role. Not a single ministerial meeting on SAF referenced the weakening of the cooking oil cap in official records, and industry responses to consultations were only obtained through Freedom of Information.

The action marks a milestone for both partners on the journey to more sustainable aviation. Alternative fuels such as Synhelion’s solar fuel are crucial to the industry’s endeavors to achieve its ambitious carbon reduction objectives.

Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) has become the first airline in the world to integrate the solar fuel manufactured by the Swiss-based Synhelion clean-tech company into its regular flight operations. Synhelion delivered a first 190-liter barrel of synthetic crude oil from its DAWN production facility to a refinery in Northern Germany, where the oil, which had been manufactured using solar energy, was processed into certified Jet-A-1 aviation fuel. The fuel was then fed into SWISS’s flight operations infrastructure via the fuel supply system at Hamburg Airport.

The fuel supplied are some seven percent of the fuel required for a Hamburg-Zurich flight – a symbolic start, but a hugely significant one. It may sound little, but it’s a landmark for the aviation sector, confirming that Synhelion’s technology works and is ready for the next steps ahead. Its seamless integration into existing refinery processes is crucial to securing the swift global scalability of Synhelion’s technology.

“This first delivery of Synhelion’s solar fuel marks a genuine milestone in our long-standing partnership,” confirms SWISS CEO Jens Fehlinger. “We have intentionally invested in a Swiss start-up; and we are delighted to celebrate this landmark achievement together. This is the first time that solar fuel has been used in civil aviation. And we are truly proud to be playing such a pioneering role, in partnership with Synhelion, in driving and developing this vital new technology for a more sustainable aviation sector.”

“Sustainable fuels are a key lever in reducing air transport’s reliance on fossil fuels,” adds Synhelion co-founder and co-CEO Philipp Furler. “Our delivery of this first barrel to SWISS may be a symbolic action. But it’s a concrete one, too, towards a more sustainable aviation sector. This milestone brings us one step closer to globally scaling up our solar fuel technology. And we’re very grateful to have such invaluable support from our partners at SWISS and the Lufthansa Group as we continue on this journey.”

Next steps: certification and scale-up. Sustainable fuels such as Synhelion’s solar fuel are key if the aviation sector is to achieve its ambitious carbon reduction objectives. This is why it is so vital that all the parties involved play their full part and join other airlines, business and industry, the political world, the research field and consumers in driving and promoting the adoption of such fuels with all possible speed. SWISS has been serving as a strategic partner to Synhelion since 2020 to support the commercialization of the company’s pioneering technologies. SWISS has also been an investor in Synhelion since 2022.

Further steps remain before solar fuel can be more extensively used in the aviation sector. The facilities required to ensure continuous production of the fuel and adequate production capacities are now being developed to permit a commercial market entry from 2027. The EU Renewable Energy Directive stipulates that sustainable synthetic fuels must achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 70 percent compared to fossil kerosene. The life cycle assessment carried out by an independent institution confirms that the fuels from the DAWN production facility can significantly exceed this target. As a next step, Synhelion and SWISS are now jointly driving forward the sustainability certification of the production process and the fuel in accordance with the requirements of the EU directive.

Lufthansa Group: a long-standing commitment to sustainable fuels. As part of the Lufthansa Group, SWISS can both draw and build on decades of experience in the sustainable aviation fuel field. The Lufthansa Group is involved in research and pilot projects, is an active member of various industrywide alliances and offers numerous innovative sustainable aviation fuel products and incentives for both corporate and private customers. It has also concluded a number of long-term fuel procurement agreements which send a strong signal to the global fuel markets and help further drive and shape the industry’s transformation.

This included an initial trial using sustainable aviation fuel, designed to assess system compatibility. This achievement marks a pivotal step in the partnership, established in September 2023, which aims to deliver a fuel system designed to meet high-performance standards and reduce environmental impact. Volker Fuchs, owner and group chief executive officer of TEST-FUCHS, praised the progress:

“Seeing our prototype components enter the initial testing phase is a proud moment for our team. From the outset, our focus has been on delivering a fuel system that not only meets the highest safety and efficiency standards but also supports the use of SAF from day one.”

Importance of Fuel System

Nico Neumann, chief executive officer at Deutsche Aircraft, also commented on this achievement and its importance to the aircraft. Neumann said:

“This milestone reflects the strength of our valued partnership with TEST-FUCHS and our shared commitment to sustainable aviation.”

The fuel system plays a key role in the future of the D328eco. It stores, manages, and delivers fuel to the engines under all flight conditions. To ensure efficiency and reliability, it must maintain correct pressure, flow rate, and temperature.

The D328eco is designed to be fully compatible with 100% sustainable aviation fuel, including emerging power-to-liquid fuels. This means it requires a highly specialised fuel system that is capable of handling the different chemical properties of SAF compared to conventional Jet A-1 fuel, such as viscosity, temperature behaviour, and material compatibility. Failures in the fuel system might lead to risks such as engine shutdown, fire, and fuel starvation.",https://i0.wp.com/travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cropped-142341008_3736125383109174_8967045553856800325_n.png?fit=32%2C32&ssl=1,N,,2025-07-24 06:58:29.470908

Neste’s comparable quarterly earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose 42% from a year earlier to 341 million euros ($401 million).

Analysts in a company-provided consensus had expected 302.5 million euros on average.

“Our sustainable aviation fuel sales increased close to 80% quarter on quarter, benefiting from additional SAF production capacity at our renewables refinery in Rotterdam,” CEO Heikki Malinen said in a statement.

The rise in SAF sales drove the sales volume in Neste’s renewable products unit to a new quarterly record of 1,096 thousand tonnes. The unit’s sales volume margin fell 5% to $361 per tonne, but exceeded analysts’ forecast of $329 per tonne.

“We saw positive developments in the biofuel regulation both in the US and EU, largely supporting long-term renewables demand,” Malinen, who joined the company last year, said.

RBC analysts said in a research note that the second quarter was a “key litmus test” for Neste’s new management, adding the results boded well for the investor sentiment.

However, Malinen warned that the market environment was volatile and headwinds from global trade tensions were expected to continue.

Neste has been battling an excess supply in the renewable fuels market, pressuring its sales volumes and leading to a reduction of around 510 jobs globally earlier in 2025.

Alhough the group said it still expected its annual sales volumes to improve from 2024, it also forecast persisting oversupply in the renewable fuels market for the year.

The industry says that achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 depends on expanding SAF availability and affordability — and fast.

Backed by the European Green Deal and the Paris Agreement, the sector reiterates its full commitment to decarbonising air travel.

“SAF is no longer a distant solution, it is a reality that must scale now,” the statement said. “It presents the opportunity to improve the EU’s energy security, strengthen its economic prosperity and bolster climate innovation.”

The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation has already played a key role, prompting SAF production to grow from almost zero to 1.2 million tonnes by 2024.

But with €61 billion needed annually to decarbonise aviation, the industry warns that high costs, regulatory complexity, and a lack of investment instruments are holding back progress.

The 10-point action plan for 2025–2026 calls for extended SAF allowances under the EU Emissions Trading System, targeted funding for e-SAF and bio-SAF projects and risk-reducing financial products from the European Investment Bank.

It also urges a revenue certainty mechanism — such as contracts for difference — to de-risk production investment and create a thriving SAF market.

Additional actions include simplifying regulation, increasing access to renewable electricity and eligible biomass, and supporting the testing and certification of new e-SAF technologies.

The aviation ecosystem emphasises the need for collaboration across Member States, EU bodies and private investors to meet 2030 targets.

“ReFuelEU Aviation is the backbone of Europe’s SAF strategy but its success relies on swift, coordinated action to resolve the remaining investment and implementation barriers,” the group concluded.

SWISS has become the first airline in the world to integrate the solar fuel manufactured by Swiss-based clean-tech pioneer Synhelion into its flight operations. The action marks a milestone for both partners on the journey to more sustainable aviation. Alternative fuels such as Synhelion’s solar fuel are crucial to the industry’s endeavors to achieve its ambitious carbon reduction objectives.

Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) has become the first airline in the world to integrate the solar fuel manufactured by the Swiss-based Synhelion clean-tech company into its regular flight operations. Synhelion delivered a first 190-liter barrel of synthetic crude oil from its DAWN production facility to a refinery in Northern Germany, where the oil, which had been manufactured using solar energy, was processed into certified Jet-A-1 aviation fuel. The fuel was then fed into SWISS’s flight operations infrastructure via the fuel supply system at Hamburg Airport.

The fuel supplied are some seven percent of the fuel required for a Hamburg-Zurich flight – a symbolic start, but a hugely significant one. It may sound little, but it’s a landmark for the aviation sector, confirming that Synhelion’s technology works and is ready for the next steps ahead. Its seamless integration into existing refinery processes is crucial to securing the swift global scalability of Synhelion’s technology.

“This first delivery of Synhelion’s solar fuel marks a genuine milestone in our long-standing partnership,” confirms SWISS CEO Jens Fehlinger. “We have intentionally invested in a Swiss start-up; and we are delighted to celebrate this landmark achievement together. This is the first time that solar fuel has been used in civil aviation. And we are truly proud to be playing such a pioneering role, in partnership with Synhelion, in driving and developing this vital new technology for a more sustainable aviation sector.”

“Sustainable fuels are a key lever in reducing air transport’s reliance on fossil fuels,” adds Synhelion co-founder and co-CEO Philipp Furler. “Our delivery of this first barrel to SWISS may be a symbolic action. But it’s a concrete one, too, towards a more sustainable aviation sector. This milestone brings us one step closer to globally scaling up our solar fuel technology. And we’re very grateful to have such invaluable support from our partners at SWISS and the Lufthansa Group as we continue on this journey.”

Next steps: certification and scale-up

Sustainable fuels such as Synhelion’s solar fuel are key if the aviation sector is to achieve its ambitious carbon reduction objectives. This is why it is so vital that all the parties involved play their full part and join other airlines, business and industry, the political world, the research field and consumers in driving and promoting the adoption of such fuels with all possible speed. SWISS has been serving as a strategic partner to Synhelion since 2020 to support the commercialization of the company’s pioneering technologies. SWISS has also been an investor in Synhelion since 2022.

Further steps remain before solar fuel can be more extensively used in the aviation sector. The facilities required to ensure continuous production of the fuel and adequate production capacities are now being developed to permit a commercial market entry from 2027. The EU Renewable Energy Directive stipulates that sustainable synthetic fuels must achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 70 percent compared to fossil kerosene. The life cycle assessment carried out by an independent institution confirms that the fuels from the DAWN production facility can significantly exceed this target. As a next step, Synhelion and SWISS are now jointly driving forward the sustainability certification of the production process and the fuel in accordance with the requirements of the EU directive.

Lufthansa Group: a long-standing commitment to sustainable fuels

As part of the Lufthansa Group, SWISS can both draw and build on decades of experience in the sustainable aviation fuel field. The Lufthansa Group is involved in research and pilot projects, is an active member of various industrywide alliances and offers numerous innovative sustainable aviation fuel products and incentives for both corporate and private customers. It has also concluded a number of long-term fuel procurement agreements which send a strong signal to the global fuel markets and help further drive and shape the industry’s transformation.

Conclusion Neste's pivot to SAF is more than a strategic repositioning—it's a masterclass in leveraging industry challenges to build long-term resilience.","In the rapidly evolving renewable fuels landscape, Neste has emerged as a trailblazer, transforming margin pressures into a formidable competitive advantage through its aggressive expansion in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) sector. As the global aviation industry grapples with decarbonization mandates and investor demands for greener operations, Neste's strategic pivot to SAF is not just a response to market forces—it's a calculated move to dominate a sector poised for exponential growth.

A Production Powerhouse in the Making

Neste's recent upgrades to its Rotterdam refinery have positioned it as a global leader in SAF production. By 2025, the company has already increased its SAF capacity to 1.5 million tons per annum, with the Rotterdam facility alone set to produce 500,000 tons annually. When fully operational by 2027, this site will become the world's largest production hub for SAF and renewable diesel, giving Neste unmatched scalability to meet surging demand.

This expansion is not merely about scale. Neste's ability to flexibly shift production between road and aviation fuels allows it to capitalize on market volatility. For instance, in Q2 2025, SAF sales surged by 80% compared to the previous quarter, underscoring the effectiveness of this strategy. By aligning production with demand fluctuations, Neste mitigates margin pressures that plague competitors with fixed-output models.

Strategic Partnerships and Regulatory Alignment

Neste's dominance in SAF is further solidified by its partnerships with industry giants. A landmark 2025 deal with Amazon Air to supply 7,500 metric tons of neat SAF for cargo operations at two U.S. airports exemplifies this. The logistics are equally innovative: SAF is delivered via existing pipelines in California and trucked using renewable diesel-powered vehicles, minimizing carbon footprints while optimizing costs.

These partnerships are not isolated successes. Neste has secured contracts with FedEx and other major airlines, aligning itself with the sector's urgent need to meet net-zero targets. Regulatory tailwinds are equally strong. The company's proactive alignment with the EU's ReFuelEU Aviation initiative and RED III mandates ensures it remains ahead of compliance curves, a critical factor in markets where policy uncertainty often stifles growth.

Operational Efficiency as a Differentiator

Neste's cost management strategies are equally impressive. By sourcing feedstocks like used cooking oil and animal fat waste—materials that are both abundant and low-cost—the company reduces raw material expenses. Third-party audits ensure these materials meet sustainability standards, a non-negotiable requirement for SAF certifications.

The supply chain innovation is another standout. For example, the use of Diesel Direct for truck deliveries to Ontario International Airport not only streamlines operations but also leverages Neste's renewable diesel to cut emissions. This closed-loop system—where SAF distribution further reduces carbon footprints—creates a unique value proposition for customers and investors alike.

Investment Implications

For investors, Neste's SAF strategy represents a rare confluence of market leadership, regulatory alignment, and operational agility. The company's ability to convert margin pressures into competitive advantages is evident in its 80% Q2 sales growth and its position as the world's largest SAF producer. With the Rotterdam expansion nearing completion and RED III implementation on the horizon, Neste is poised to capture a significant share of a market projected to grow by over 30% annually through 2030.

However, risks remain. Feedstock supply chain disruptions and the high capital intensity of SAF production could test Neste's margins. Yet, the company's diversified sourcing strategy and partnerships with logistics providers like Diesel Direct provide a buffer.

Conclusion

Neste's pivot to SAF is more than a strategic repositioning—it's a masterclass in leveraging industry challenges to build long-term resilience. By combining cutting-edge production capabilities, regulatory foresight, and operational efficiency, the company is not just surviving in a margin-pressed market; it's thriving. For investors seeking exposure to the decarbonization megatrend, Neste offers a compelling case: a leader in a high-growth sector with the infrastructure, partnerships, and innovation to outpace competitors.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-24 06:59:11.050035

Formula 1 is trying to change that.

Often referred to as “the pinnacle of motorsport,” the racecar organization, which hosts an annual championship featuring the best drivers in the world, has seen its carbon emissions drop 26% since 2018. At the end of the 2024 season, the sport’s carbon footprint fell to 168,720 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent from 228,793.

F1 said in a statement on Wednesday that it’s halfway toward achieving its minimum 50% reduction target, as set out in its “net zero by 2030” commitment.

“It’s a key milestone and the culmination of a lot of work,” said Ellen Jones, head of environmental, social and governance at F1, in an interview. “We’ve changed the way we operate, changed the way we work” with the racing teams and promoters, as well Formula 1’s management and regulator, she said.

A major factor in the reductions has been a years-long shift to renewable energy, Jones said. Investment in sustainable aviation fuel for travel and freight use, and other alternative energy sources, including solar and biofuels, contributed to the decline. Next year, F1 has set a target for the cars to have new hybrid engines and be powered entirely by advanced sustainable fuel.

“We’re not only changing what we’re doing materially, we’re also changing the technologies,” Jones said.

The sport has achieved carbon reductions across the four major categories that it tracks: factories and facilities, down 59% since 2018; logistics, down 9%; event operations, down 12% on a per-race basis; and travel, down 25%.

An increase in using remote operations and changes to the race schedule also have resulted in lower greenhouse gas emissions. Having remote broadcast operations has allowed about 140 personnel to avoid having to travel to the race location each weekend. And changing the date of the Japanese Grand Prix to align with other races last year in the Asia-Pacific region also contributed to lower emissions. In 2026, the date of the Monaco Grand Prix will be moved to align with other European events and eliminate an additional transatlantic crossing.

F1 said its climate commitment is “set in accordance with the science” from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and aligns with the panel's definition of net zero emissions. The racing series’ goal is to reduce absolute emissions by a minimum of 50% from a 2018 baseline, which was calculated using guidance set by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.

F1 has faced criticism from activists who say the sport is harmful to the environment. In 2022, demonstrators with Just Stop Oil sat on the track during the 2022 British Grand Prix, disrupting the race. The construction of Madrid's Grand Prix street circuit also has prompted backlash.

We also thank the teams at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the U.S. Department of Agriculture for their tireless work to deliver these trade deals and removing trade barriers for U.S. ethanol.” The U.S. Grains Council is also commending the agreements.
This deal is an embodiment of our countries’ longstanding partnership and includes ethanol and SAF that fits into Japan’s policies of increasing the use of renewable fuels, that include U.S. ethanol.","President Donald Trump on July 22 announced new trade framework agreements with Indonesia and Japan. Both agreements are expected to benefit the U.S. agriculture industry, including farmers and ethanol producers.

The trade deal with Indonesia includes provisions eliminating tariff barriers, on a preferential basis, on over 99% of U.S. products exported to Indonesia across all sectors, including for all agricultural products, health products, seafood, information and communications technology, automotive products, and chemicals.

The Japanese trade deal includes a provision specifically targeting ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). According to the White House, Japan will purchase $8 billion in U.S. goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol, and SAF.

The Renewable Fuels Association has spoken out in support of both trade agreements. “We’re grateful to President Trump and his team for ensuring U.S. agriculture and renewable fuels are prominently included in these framework agreements,” said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the RFA. “These deals will ultimately help open important Asian markets and allow greater access for American farm products, renewable fuels, and co-products like distillers grains. This administration clearly understands the leading role American farmers and renewable fuel producers can play when it comes to feeding and fueling the world, and we salute President Trump’s efforts to secure fair and reciprocal agreements around the globe. Breaking down barriers to fair trade strengthens our rural economy and the United States as a whole.”

Growth Energy applauded the agreements. “Ethanol exports set a record in 2024, and President Trump’s latest deals will help to ensure that American farmers and biofuel producers continue to benefit from new and growing markets in Asia,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “We commend President Trump for following through on his commitment to unleash American energy dominance and tear down unfair barriers to exports from rural America. We also thank the teams at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the U.S. Department of Agriculture for their tireless work to deliver these trade deals and removing trade barriers for U.S. ethanol.”

The U.S. Grains Council is also commending the agreements. “The U.S. Grains Council commends the Trump Administration on its historic trade deal with Indonesia, that will enhance trade for both countries and places a zero tariff on the products the Council represents,” said Ryan LeGrand, president and CEO of the USGC. “In the 2023-24 marketing year, Indonesia was the fourth largest importer for U.S. distillers dried grains with solubles at 1,024,000 metric tons. That translates into a nearly $299 million market, and we hope the deal announced today will not only help see those numbers increase but open doors wider to the full range of products we have to offer.”

“The U.S. Grains Council applauds the Trump Administration on this agreement with our second largest trading partner – Japan,” LeGrand added. In the 2023-24 marketing year, Japan was the second largest importer of U.S. corn; the third largest importer of U.S. sorghum; the fourth largest importer of U.S. barley; and the 9th largest importer of U.S. distillers dried grains with solubles, totaling 14 million metric tons in corn-equivalent exports or $5.95 billion. This deal is an embodiment of our countries’ longstanding partnership and includes ethanol and SAF that fits into Japan’s policies of increasing the use of renewable fuels, that include U.S. ethanol.

The final bill mirrors some last-minute changes the Senate made to the tax provisions in the sprawling budget bill—reviving long-expired biofuel subsidies in addition to expanding eligibility and extending expiration for another major biofuels tax credit.

The final bill extends the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit by two years and greatly expands its eligibility. 45Z, originally created by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), is designed to subsidize production of transportation fuels with low or no greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This credit came into effect at the beginning of 2025 and was intended to replace a suite of recently expired biofuel tax credits (Section 40, 40A, 40B, 6426, and 6427). 45Z was scheduled to expire in 2027 under the IRA but will now expire at the end of 2029 under OBBBA—two years shorter than the House-passed bill and the Senate Finance Committee draft, but still a two-year bonus for eligible producers.

The final OBBBA stayed the same course as previous House and Senate proposals and preserves a controversial carveout that eliminates penalties for converting forests or grasslands into farmland for biofuels production. This essentially weakens the definition of “clean” fuel and significantly broadens eligibility for the credit, effectively allowing first-generation, food-based biofuels like corn ethanol and soy biodiesel to qualify. Corn ethanol and soy-based biodiesel—already mandated under the Renewable Fuel Standard and subsidized since the Carter era—could once again dominate the biofuels subsidy stream.

OBBBA establishes parity between Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other transportation fuels under 45Z. SAF was previously eligible for a maximum credit of $1.75 per gallon (if prevailing wage and apprenticeship (PW&A) requirements are met), whereas other non-SAF fuels were only eligible for a maximum credit of $1.00 per gallon (if PW&A requirements are met). Under OBBBA, all fuels are eligible for the same $1.00 per gallon a maximum credit. Additionally, the bill eliminates potential double-dipping of 45Z and the SAF excise tax credit under Section 6426(k).

Mirroring the last-minute changes made by the Senate Budget Committee, the final bill also tacked on a provision that resurrects and increases the biodiesel tax credit (Section 40A), which had previously expired at the end of 2024, but only for small agri-biodiesel producers (Section 40A(b)(4)). The credit now runs from mid-2025 through the end of 2026. OBBBA doubles the credit amount from $0.10 per gallon to $0.20 per gallon for fuels sold after June 30, 2025. The small agri-biodiesel credit can now be transferred to an unrelated third party and be stacked on top of 45Z. In effect, some producers could double dip 40A and 45Z for the same gallon of fuel.

The final bill imposes new “foreign entity of concern” (FEOC) restrictions for the suite of tax credits that are not terminated, including 45Z. No specified foreign entities can claim 45Z after OBBBA’s enactment. No foreign-influenced entities (an FEOC category of lesser degree) can claim 45Z two years after the bill’s enactment. Additionally, the bill restricts eligibility for both 45Z and the small agri-biodiesel producer credit to feedstocks grown in the U.S., Canada, or Mexico for fuels produced after 2025.",https://www.taxpayer.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/engin-akyurt-nipgFe8mWB8-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-24 06:59:43.197001

UK names SAF and e-SAF projects to share £63mn funding

London, 22 July (Argus) — The UK government has named 17 sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and e-fuels projects to share £63mn ($85mn) grant funding in the third round of its advanced fuels fund (AFF). The projects range in size from trials to commercial scale, and propose to use technologies incuding alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) or synthesis of CO2 and renewable hydrogen to make e-SAF ( see table ). The UK gave the largest sum, £10mn, to US firm LanzaJet for its 80,000 t/yr SAF plant targeting 2028 start, which will exclusively supply to British Airways. London granted £8mn to Riyadh-headquartered Alfanar for its Lighthouse Green Fuels project that aims to make more than 125,000 t/yr of SAF. Alfanar won £11mn and £8.7mn in the first and second rounds, respectively. Its start date has slipped to 2029 and costs have risen to £2bn from £1.5bn, the firm said last month. Some projects could make SAF and e-SAF, such as Essar's project at Stanlow, which aims to use a combined 550,000 t/yr of e-methanol and biomethanol to make 200,000 t/yr of SAF products. It will use the funds for a pre-front-end engineering design (Feed) study and it plans a final investment decision in 2027, it said. Nine grant winners will make at least some proportion of e-SAF, either directly from hydrogen or by converting e-methanol. This route is sometimes called power-to-liquid in the UK. Of the e-SAF projects, the largest award went to UK start-up Carbon Neutral Fuels, which won £6mn for a project that aims to make 25,000 t/yr of e-SAF starting from 2031. The firm is starting Feed for the plant, it said. The UK has now granted nearly £200mn to projects through the AFF scheme, with the third round building on the £80mn first round and £53mn second round . The third-round grants can go towards engineering, procurement and construction, Feed studies, and pre-feed studies, but not to feasibility studies. The UK is separately developing a revenue certainty subsidy scheme for novel SAF and e-SAF production. At least one UK-focused SAF project could stall having missed out on funding. The Gramm Consortium is considering ""last-minute options"" to keep a proposed 250,000 t/yr SAF plant in the UK and may re-locate to the US, the project's lead Alexander Peschkoff said. With an increasing number of world governments setting SAF quotas, pressure is mounting to add more production pathways to avoid shortages. The UK and EU have gone furthest in this respect by adding separate e-SAF quotas to spur novel production routes. But there is much uncertainty about the best technologies to use. The UK is fast approaching the 2028 start for its e-SAF quota, while the EU's is due to start in 2030.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), particularly hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) derived from waste cooking oil (WCO), is the most viable pathway to realize the target of “Fly Net Zero” for the aviation industry. To develop reaction mechanisms of SAF suitable for combustor simulations, two different SAFs (named SAF1 and SAF2) synthesized from WCO and certificated by Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) were investigated. The detailed compositional analyses of these two SAFs were executed via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique, and the results were used to construct surrogate models. The pyrolysis and oxidation experiments were performed in a flow reactor at 1000 K and an atmospheric pressure to obtain the speciation data for the two SAFs. The Hybrid Chemistry (HyChem) approach was employed to develop reaction mechanisms of the two SAFs. A multi-objective genetic algorithm, NSGA-II, was utilized to determine the three Arrhenius coefficients of the seven lumped reactions. Both HyChem models were successfully validated by the experimental data. The speciation data and global combustion parameters were accurately predicted by HyChem models for these two SAFs. Finally, sensitivity analysis revealed the similar effects of the seven lumped reactions on ignition delay time (IDT) for the two SAFs. R2 (fuel + H), R4 (fuel + OH), and R5 (fuel + O2) play important roles in the system reactivity, while R6 (fuel + HO2) and R7 (fuel + O) have negligible influence on IDT predictions for all tested conditions.",https://cdn.ssrn.com/ssrn-global-header/11589acb53bc518aa22929bf19add113.svg,N,,2025-07-24 02:00:31.663306

As part of this initiative, Illinois engineers have been hard at work creating the critical nanocatalysts for converting biocrude oil from food waste such as salad dressing into sustainable aviation fuel.

A side of salad dressing, that is.

In 2020, the United States federal government committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. An important step toward carbon neutrality is embracing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), an alternative to conventional jet fuel that is made from renewable feedstocks. As part of this initiative, Illinois engineers have been hard at work creating the critical nanocatalysts for converting biocrude oil from food waste such as salad dressing into sustainable aviation fuel.

Hong Yang, a professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering in the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences, and Yuanhui Zhang, a professor of agricultural and biological engineering in the Grainger College of Engineering, joined forces to tackle this problem.

Their findings, published in Science Advances, present a low-cost, scalable, and reusable catalyst to produce an alternative to traditional jet fuel, demonstrating the first production of SAF from food waste-derived biocrude using non-noble metal carbide catalysts.

“There is already an industry effort for SAF production in North America, but primarily in competition with food supply such as soybean oil,” said Zhang. “Currently, the United States consumes about 40 million tons of jet fuel annually which only includes about 1% of SAF. We could increase that number to 10-20% from biowaste alone.”

Unlike traditional jet fuels derived from fossil crude oil, SAF is made from renewable resources such as biomass, energy crops, food waste, sewage sludge, and algal bloom. For nearly three decades, Zhang’s lab has been working to produce biocrude oil via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of organic waste streams. HTL mimics the natural process of fossil crude formation but accelerates the conversion timeline from millions of years to half an hour.

Yang and Zhang thought that by simultaneously addressing carbon emissions and food waste they could kill two birds with one stone.

After collecting food waste from the Kraft food plant in Champaign, Illinois, the researchers used HTL to convert the waste into a biocrude oil. This biocrude was upgraded using non-precious metal carbide catalysts developed by Yang’s lab.

“Molybdenum carbide is an attractive option for a catalyst that aids this process because its outer shell electrons interact with biocrude molecules to remove oxygen,” Yang said.

For their specific food waste of choice, the team quickly zeroed in on salad dressing because it is preprocessed, homogenous, and high in energy. Through a catalytic conversion process, scientists can remove unwanted oxygen in these biocrudes, turning them into hydrocarbon fuels.

“We also have to fine tune the catalysts by adding iron atoms and other species to produce fuel molecules with molecular weights that resemble the fuel composition” said Siying Yu, a chemical and biomolecular engineering graduate student and the first author of the paper.

Going forward, Zhang and Yang will continue collaborating with the goal of enhancing their catalyst design to better convert biocrude made from other biowaste to meet SAF criteria. Specifically, they’d like their catalyst to work for a variety of bio feedstocks such as algae and sewage. The metal carbide nanocatalysts they developed could also be appliable in studying SAF production from oleochemical-based fermentation products and crop-based feedstocks.

“There is no good substitute for aviation fuel for long-haul air transportation, so the research on SAF products is very much needed.” Yang said. “I’m optimistic because our students love this research topic. They want to work on something that will change the world.”

The proposal is to produce sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, a lower-emission alternative to conventional jet fuel, and ship it by boat to distributors and airlines.

The project would include two components in Guysborough County — a joint wind and solar farm in St. Mary's and a plant in the community of Goldboro. The plant would use the wind and solar energy, as well as wood chips, to power hydrogen production. The hydrogen, in turn, would power the production of SAF.

Michael Galvin has been working on the idea for four years and said he's eager to make the project's first submission to the province. He expects the application for environmental assessment for the Goldboro plant will be made in early September.

""It's really significant and it's also really significant for our investors to see that we have reached this milestone,"" he said in an interview.

The project began with Irish firm Simply Blue Group, but changed hands this year. Galvin was chief operating officer at Simply Blue and moved, along with the project, to Octopus Energy Generation, which is now backing the project.

A local entity, Nova Sustainable Fuels, was created to manage the project.

Interest in sustainable aviation fuel has been growing in recent years, particularly in Europe where some governments have set mandates and created subsidies for its use. Galvin said that means the list of proposed SAF projects — and competitors — got very long. But he said that's begun to change.

""A lot of the hype has started to die down. And now you're seeing the really serious players and really serious investors have now stepped forward, and I think you're seeing the strongest projects and the most likely projects to run to completion.""

Galvin said completion for his project is still at least five years away, assuming it receives all the necessary approvals and raises enough capital. He wouldn't put an exact number on it, but said the cost will be in the billions of dollars.

""It's costing more than I wish it was going to cost. These are big numbers and big infrastructure projects,"" he said.

This is not the only major industrial project proposed for Guysborough County. Other companies are eyeing the remote eastern corner of mainland Nova Scotia for wind farms to power hydrogen production, a commercial spaceport and a gold mine.

Paul Long, warden of the District of the Municipality of Guysborough, said the local government is hungry for economic development.

Tough by Nature

Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is a perennial warm-season grass native to North America. It thrives on marginal land, tolerates drought and heat, and requires minimal fertilizer or irrigation — making it a strong candidate for sustainable biomass production.

High Energy Return

It produces six times more energy than is required to grow and harvest it. That energy ratio, combined with its ability to grow in regions unsuitable for food crops, gives it an edge in the bioenergy landscape.

Not Just Ethanol

Switchgrass isn’t just a source of traditional ethanol. It’s being considered for advanced biofuels like isobutanol and even sustainable aviation fuel via alcohol-to-jet pathways.

Drought Dilemma

When grown in drought conditions, switchgrass produces higher levels of compounds like saponins, which inhibit fermentation. That’s why researchers like Trey Sato are digging into how stress conditions affect downstream conversion.

Feedstock of the Future?

As climate change intensifies and the aviation sector looks to decarbonize, switchgrass may become a key player in next-generation fuel production — but only if its biological bottlenecks can be understood and addressed.",https://seedworld.com/cdn/wp-content/uploads/20250723145246/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-23-2025-02_50_56-PM.png,N,,2025-07-23 16:57:12.485428

Additionally, the aircraft will have an advanced cabin temperature control system utilizing the engines liquid cooling to ensure a comfortable flight experience in diverse conditions.

“The market has been heard, loud and clear regarding the need for a reliable, cost-effective, heavy fuel, multi-engine training platform,” said John Calcagno, President and CEO of Piper Aircraft, Inc. “The new Seminole DX fills that market void perfectly. Based on interest received since our MOU announcement last year, we anticipate global market demand for the Seminole DX to be between 25 to 40 aircraft per year over the next 10 years. The DeltaHawk team has been a pleasure to work with over the past 16 months as they epitomize quality and customer focus. Future collaborations are in process as well.”

A 20-year Long Term Supply Agreement (LTSA) designates DeltaHawk as the exclusive heavy fuel, piston engine supplier for the Piper Seminole. Certification flight testing begins in November 2025, with FAA certification expected in Q3 2026, followed by certifications from Transport Canada, EASA, and India’s DGCA. Deliveries of 2027 model year Seminole DX aircraft are anticipated to begin in late 2026 or early 2027.

“The installation of our certified DHK engine in the legendary Piper Seminole is a perfect match with our industry-unique features to provide the lowest cost of ownership and the simplest and safest multi-engine training platform ever,” said Christopher Ruud, Chief Executive Officer of DeltaHawk Engines. “Just as important, we see this new 20-year agreement not just in terms of engines, but also as a wonderful step by Piper, utilizing DeltaHawk’s powerful innovation, while creating environmental sustainability for general aviation worldwide.”

The Seminole DX offers significant performance enhancements* over the current PA-44 Seminole, including a 35% reduction in fuel burn, a 32% increase in single-engine climb rate, and a 70% higher single-engine absolute ceiling.

Piper and DeltaHawk are exploring further engine applications for both the PA-28 Archer and PA-46 M-Class platforms, strengthening their partnership for future innovations.",https://assets.skiesmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Seminole-DX-%E2%80%94-Piper-Aircraft.jpg,N,,2025-07-23 21:56:15.540815

The manufactured fuel will be supplied to aviation companies in Northern Europe and exported to other markets around the world.

NorSAF will be the largest SAF production plant in Northern Europe producing approximately 100,000 tons of SAF annually once operations begin in 2030. The scope of the project is estimated at 500-600 million euros, depending on the selected technological solution. As this project will have to compete on a global scale, its successful implementation depends on the aid and support it receives from the European Union, institutional investors and local authorities.

Often referred to the future of aviation, SAF generates significantly less greenhouse gas emissions than conventional jet fuel. Starting this year, the European Union has implemented a requirement that at least 2% of all fuel consumed at larger airports must be SAF. This mandate will gradually increase, reaching 6% by 2030, 20% by 2035, and 70% by 2050.

Jonas Janukenas, CEO of the Group, emphasizes that the development of the aviation industry itself is now directly linked to new sustainability standards.

""The number of SAF production projects currently planned will likely be insufficient to meet the growing demand for sustainable aviation fuels in the coming years. EU regulations are mandating the increasing use of SAF, which will only ramp up year after year. Once complete, NorSAF will play a crucial role in ensuring that there is enough SAF available to the aviation industry,"" he says.

The ambitious project is the Group's first foray into the field of aviation fuel production. The Group’s subsidiary Baltic Ground Services was chosen to implement the technological part of the project because of their extensive experience with SAF supply and distribution.

The new facility in Latvia will use PureSAF technology, developed by Swedish Biofuels AB and exclusively licensed via the US engineering firm KBR. This technology has been proven to reduce GHG emissions by up to 93% compared to conventional jet fuels.

""It's important to understand that by 2030, there will be another important condition – 1.2% of all supplied SAF will have to be synthetic. This type of fuel is produced without the use biological components. Instead, green energy is used to produce hydrogen, which is then mixed with carbon dioxide. This mandate will also gradually increase, and by 2050, half of all SAF fuel will have to be synthetic. So, changes in the aviation sector are already happening at full speed,"" says Vytautas Cekanavicius, CEO of Baltic Ground Services and Board Member of NorSAF.

Using PureSAF technology, NorSAF will be able to produce both SAF and eSAF (a synthetic fuel derived from renewable energy) from bioethanol, hydrogen, and captured CO2. A complete green energy cycle will be a key feature of the completed project. Green electricity will power electrolysis for green hydrogen production, which will then be combined with captured CO₂ and ethanol to create both SAF and eSAF. The use of extracted CO2 in the production of the fuel will be particularly beneficial to the environment.

KBR is undertaking the feasibility study, which is expected to be completed by the second half of 2025. Work on the project is expected to commence shortly after that.

""A large part of the infrastructure we require is already present at the Liepaja Free Economic Zone. It has gas pipelines and railway lines, ethanol transshipment is already taking place here, and there are plans for a green hydrogen plant. Currently, negotiations are also underway with one large company from which we would purchase carbon dioxide and use part of it for synthetic SAF production,"" explains Vytautas Cekanavicius, Board Member of NorSAF.

Janis Kisiels, Board Member of NorSAF, is confident that the results of the feasibility study done by KBR will enable the start of work on the project this year, with the aim of being operational by 2030.

""This plant is a very good example of how companies from the region, working together, can implement large and truly ambitious projects contributing to aviation’s green transition. We aim to produce much more SAF fuel than will be needed for the entire Baltic countries' market, so we intend to export the majority of our produced SAF,"" he says.

It is estimated that the new Liepaja plant will produce 100,000 tons of SAF annually.

In Asia, SAF policies have started to be announced and proposed across the region, although the development remains uneven.","Article Summary

The demand for air travel, and therefore jet fuel, is growing year on year due to growth in emerging markets, increased air cargo traffic, and changing travel habits. Demand is already equating to pre-pandemic levels this year and will continue growing until at least 2050.

Many governments are turning to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable or waste-derived aviation fuels that meet the sustainability criteria under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), to help mitigate the resulting greenhouse gases. Globally, 28 SAF policies are in place or under development.

It is one of the most viable and scalable options for decarbonising aviation, with the potential to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% (Source: IATA). What makes the fuel more attractive is that it can be blended with conventional jet fuel without the need to change operating equipment, making it ideal for immediate use.

The World Economic Forum (WEF) predicts more than 17 million tonnes of SAF will be required by 2030. It can be made from renewable sources or waste products such as cooking oil or agricultural waste, and technologies are being developed to produce it from CO₂ and hydrogen. Despite this progress, a gap is expected to remain between the demand for SAF and global production capacity.

What is driving SAF demand?

One of the most influential policies when it comes to SAF uptake is the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive III (RED III). This mandates that greenhouse gas emissions from transport fuels should be reduced by 65%, rising to 70% for non-biological renewable transport fuels from January 2021. To support this, EU airports should use jet fuel with 2% SAF. This increases incrementally until 2050, when 63% of aviation fuel used by EU airports should be made up of SAF.

Further mandates and incentives have been put in place by the EU, such as the European Hydrogen Bank’s €3 billion support fund for hydrogen projects, including e-SAF.

Other regions have taken similar approaches. For example, the UK’s Jet Zero Strategy mandates that at least 10% of jet fuel must be made from sustainable sources by 2030. This strategy is accompanied by the £165 million Advanced Fuels Fund to kickstart the UK’s SAF industry.

The US government has taken an incentive-led approach, focusing on funding for research and tax credits. This includes $300 million of grants for research and development. In addition, until 2025, any sale of a qualified SAF mixture used and produced by a US taxpayer qualifies for a tax credit per gallon. This has the potential to increase depending on the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. The Biden administration introduced a number of initiatives to support the growth of the domestic SAF market, particularly tax credits and subsidies. However, red states favouring biofuels are likely to remain under the new government.

In Asia, SAF policies have started to be announced and proposed across the region, although the development remains uneven. Singapore, Japan, and China have announced SAF targets, while others are in various stages of proposal. While the policy environment is less advanced for SAF in Asia, policies are starting to develop across the region.

On a global scale, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aims to complement other carbon reduction schemes through CORSIA, which helps define the criteria and carbon intensity of sustainable aviation fuels.

SAF industry challenges: creating uncertainty

Developers in the SAF industry are facing a range of challenges. There is concern about tariffs, as well as the limited availability of feedstocks. Additionally, the industry is experiencing a widespread skills shortage.

One major challenge involves maturing technologies. Although hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) technologies have reached a high Technology Readiness Level (TRL), other SAF technologies are still developing at a commercial scale. These technologies have been proven at the concept and pilot plant stages, but still come with risks of performance and reliability at scale.

Feedstock availability is another factor. The suitability of a given technology and production scale often depends on feedstock access. Global locations offer a variety of feedstocks, but also pose challenges related to logistics, quality, and quantity. Existing local infrastructure is also a significant factor in feedstock logistics.

Local policies play an essential role. As SAF policies continue to be adopted globally, supportive local regulations will be needed to help launch and sustain the industry.

Higher capital expenditure (Capex) is also a concern. Based on KBR’s recent project experience, the cost of building new SAF production facilities is relatively high. Some projects have struggled to move into the construction phase due to difficulties securing loans. However, several key measures are recommended for new SAF developers: • Selecting appropriate technologies and feedstocks.

• Utilising existing infrastructure, including integration with refineries or storage terminals and product/feed logistics.

• Choosing plant locations with good logistics.

• Seeking lenders offering green funding at lower interest rates.

Choosing the right technology and construction method for each project is another important consideration.

As more countries move to mandate a minimum share of SAF in jet fuel, helping to meet this demand presents a significant business opportunity.

A range of SAF production pathways

There are multiple ways to create SAF, generally dependent on the feedstock used, with 11 conversion processes and 49 feedstocks currently widely accepted by organisations such as ASTM International. The ICAO goes one step further, requiring SAF to meet sustainability criteria to be eligible for CORSIA. The major conversion processes are explained below. Many of the processes are well known but are not yet widely used for SAF production.

Fischer-Tropsch hydroprocessed synthesised paraffinic kerosene (FT-SPK) uses a diverse range of feedstocks such as natural gas or biomass. The carbon intensity of this process is lower when powered by renewable energy sources. It also has a lower sulphur and aromatic content, which reduces the impact on aircraft engines. However, the production costs and hydrogen consumption are high, making it unviable.

Synthesised paraffinic kerosene from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) is fed by bio-oils, animal fat, or recycled oils. The used nature of the feedstock and low operating costs are appealing, but this is balanced by the low availability of feedstock and high start-up costs.",,N,,2025-07-23 17:56:57.628694

Carbon Neutral Fuels, a London-headquartered decarbonisation business, will receive a £6m grant from the Advanced Fuels Fund to take forward plans for a production plant in Workington.

CNF wants to develop a commercial scale plant that uses solid oxide electrolysis and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis technology to convert low carbon electricity and CO2 from direct air capture and biogenic sources into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

This is the third grant window opened by the Department for Transport. The government’s target is that by 2040, 22% of total jet fuel demand must be SAF, up from 2% today.

Company co-founder Alasdair Lumsden said: “This support comes as we enter FEED for our ASAP-DAC project in Cumbria. The facility will produce sustainable aviation fuel using power-to-liquid and direct air capture technologies, at commercial scale. It’s a first for the UK.”

Local MP Josh MacAlister said: “Over 2,000 jobs would be created during construction and over 50 direct full time jobs during operation. Located near the Port of Workington, the plant would produce 25,000 tonnes of green jet fuel per year, with an 89% reduction in emissions across the lifecycle of the fuel compared to current fossil jet fuel.

BOOK NOW: Energy & Power 2025

“The £6m government funding boost announced today is a real vote of confidence in our area and it will help to fast-track the project to a final investment decision. So, it isn’t 100% nailed down just yet, but we’re very close and I’ll keep working hard to make it happen in the weeks ahead.”

At Essar Energy Transition’s Stanlow hub, where a variety of projects are being progressed within the orbit of the oil refinery, £2.5m is pledged to take forward plans for a production facility converting methanol into SAF.

This methanol-to-jet hub could, said Essar, be capable of producing 200,000 tonnes per year of advanced SAF, using 550,000 tonnes per year of renewable e-methanol and bio-methanol sourced domestically in the UK and internationally, including from sister company Essar Future Energies, which is developing an e-methanol project in Gujarat.

A feasibility study has been completed this year, and the receipt of this grant from the AFF programme will enable Essar to advance to the pre-front-end engineering design stage.

Essar is targeting completion of this stage by March next year, with full front-end design taking place next summer ahead of a final investment decision by the end of 2027.

The MtJ production hub’s location at Stanlow, close to Ellesmere Port, will look to leverage the terminal’s existing import infrastructure, enabling access to the most competitive, low cost and low carbon intensity methanol feedstocks.

The existing refinery processing facilities, combined with low-carbon power, hydrogen and carbon capture facilities under development, also offer unique integration opportunities to create one of the lowest CI SAF production facilities in the UK, Essar said.

In January this year, Essar appointed Turkish contractor ENKA to deliver a low-carbon hydrogen production plant at Stanlow, a key part of the HyNet project. A £360m carbon capture plant is also in the works.

Essar Energy Transition’s established UK jet export infrastructure includes the Manchester Jet, Midlands, and UKOP oil pipeline systems, as well as existing road and marine distribution routes, allowing supply to regions across the UK. This infrastructure already supplies 10 UK airports including nearby Manchester International Airport.

The hub will be the most direct SAF supply point to the UK aviation sector, the firm said.

Tony Fountain, managing director at Essar Energy Transition, said: “We welcome the UK government’s support, which enables us to carry out a detailed pre-front-end engineering design process and accelerate this flagship UK advanced sustainable aviation fuels project towards final investment decision.

“At Stanlow, we have major decarbonisation ambitions, aiming to become a leading energy transition hub and home to the world’s first low-carbon process refinery. Domestic advanced SAF production is central to our long-term vision and a key catalyst for decarbonising aviation. With SAF still making up only a tiny fraction of global jet fuel use, our MtJ plant will play a critical role in closing that gap and helping the UK meet its Jet Zero targets.”",https://www.placenorthwest.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/essar-stanlow-overview-c-eet.jpg,N,,2025-07-23 11:57:22.606985

In a move that could punch well above its weight, French Polynesia is embracing zero-emission technology in aviation, thanks to a new collaboration between ATOBA Energy and local airline Air Moana.

Pioneering SAF in One of the World’s Most Remote Places

On July 22, 2025, ATOBA and Air Moana inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), laying the groundwork for a 10-year SAF partnership. This isn’t just a symbolic handshake; it’s a serious, long-term bet on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) transforming inter-island travel in Tahiti and the surrounding archipelago. The plan includes a mix of good old-fashioned physical fuel deliveries and a more modern twist: a “book and claim” system that helps bridge infrastructure gaps.

Out here, where hopping on a plane is more necessity than luxury, this is a big deal. With over 100 islands sprinkled across the sea, aviation is often the only way people, goods, and services move around. But all those flights come at an environmental cost—especially when the fuel powering them travels thousands of kilometers. That’s where SAF comes into play.

What’s SAF, and How Does ‘Book and Claim’ Help?

Sustainable aviation fuel is made from renewable sources—think waste oils, agricultural byproducts, and other biomass. Depending on how it’s produced, SAF can cut lifecycle emissions by as much as 80%. Even better, it works in existing aircraft with no modifications needed. Air Moana’s choice of ATR 72-600 aircraft, which are already pretty efficient, means every drop of SAF counts even more.

Now, let’s talk about that ‘book and claim’ model. It’s kind of like green energy certificates for aviation. The airline buys SAF credits, confirming the fuel was produced and injected into the system—even if it wasn’t pumped into their own planes. It’s a smart way to kickstart cleaner skies while the actual delivery infrastructure catches up in remote places like this.

This Is What a Long Game Looks Like

This isn’t a quick PR play or a one-off trial flight. With a bold 10-year offtake agreement, Air Moana becomes the first airline in the South Pacific to lock in SAF for the long haul. That kind of commitment sends a clear message to fuel producers and investors: there’s real momentum building here. And with early conversations already happening around setting up local production in Tahiti, this deal could pave the way for new infrastructure—and new jobs—down the line.

For ATOBA, the partnership also reflects a shift in strategy. They’re leaning into delivering SAF where it’s needed most but hardest to implement. With expertise spanning technology evaluation, market analysis, and negotiating the long-term deals that make everything tick, the France-based energy firm is helping level the playing field for small, remote airlines trying to do the right thing.

Beyond Emissions: Building Local Resilience

This isn’t just about reducing emissions—it’s also about rewriting the economic script. A healthy SAF market in the Pacific could eventually support homegrown refining, creating local jobs, encouraging skills development, and diversifying economies that rely heavily on tourism and fisheries. And in a place that’s already feeling the impacts of rising seas and changing weather patterns, that kind of green resilience isn’t just nice to have—it’s vital.

Of course, no road is without bumps. SAF still costs more than traditional fuel. And some folks aren’t sold on the certificate system, arguing that emissions cuts should happen where they’re claimed. Valid points. This makes transparency, smart governance, and a steady move toward actual fuel deliveries all the more important to keep the trust and momentum going.

Zooming Out: A Global Movement with Local Flavor

Big headlines about green hydrogen and SAF adoption often come from places like Europe or California—where policy tools, funding, and infrastructure make things easier. But many remote regions lag not because of a lack of vision, but simply because they don’t have the same resources. That’s why this partnership stands out. It’s a homegrown solution, with both eyes on the long term, in one of the most challenging—and crucial—settings for sustainable energy transitions.

A new Deloitte analysis of the European Union’s ReFuelEU Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandate suggests that the climate-centric rule could unintentionally deter travelers from using European carriers and hubs, potentially adding cost and complexity to trips that originate, connect, or terminate in Brussels and other EU cities.

What the ReFuelEU mandate asks of airlines

Under ReFuelEU, airlines operating from European airports must steadily increase the proportion of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blended into every gallon of jet fuel they load. The regulation is a cornerstone of the bloc’s plan to decarbonize aviation, yet still accommodate the millions of people who rely on air travel for work and leisure. Unlike carbon offset programs, the SAF rule directly targets aircraft emissions by substituting a portion of fossil-based kerosene with bio- or synthetic alternatives.

Deloitte’s study, prepared for industry trade group Airlines for Europe, contends the mandate could prove more disruptive than policymakers anticipate. The research team modeled ticket prices on long-haul flights, comparing European carriers bound by the SAF quota to competitors operating from hubs in Istanbul, Dubai, and Doha. Those non-EU airlines face no comparable requirement and can therefore buy traditional jet fuel at today’s lower market price.

A potential 15 percent difference by 2030

The price gap is not trivial. “Cost disparities could rise by up to 15 percent on key EU–Asia routes by 2030,” Deloitte wrote in the study. In a statement, the company said. For a family of four planning a European summer vacation in Southeast Asia, the differential might translate into hundreds of euros, enough to make a one-stop itinerary via Istanbul or Dubai look far more attractive than a direct flight on a European flag carrier.

Why travelers could feel the pinch

Airlines typically pass additional operating costs on to passengers. If meeting the SAF requirement adds several euros to every long-haul ticket, price-sensitive travelers may book through non-EU hubs or even shift their vacation entirely outside the bloc, the report warns. Such “carbon and business leakage” undermines the EU’s climate goals because the flight happens anyway—just with tanks full of cheaper, more polluting fuel loaded elsewhere.

Besides higher fares, European passengers might confront reduced nonstop options. As ticket sales migrate to non-EU carriers, European airlines could trim or cancel marginal routes, forcing travelers onto less convenient schedules or multiple connections.

SAF-BAM: An accounting fix on the table

To preserve environmental ambition while leveling the commercial playing field, Deloitte proposes a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Book and Claim Accounting Mechanism, or SAF-BAM. The concept is similar to renewable energy certificates in the power sector.

Airlines purchase SAF where it is most readily available—perhaps at a U.S. refinery or a Nordic biofuel complex—and earn digital certificates that represent the environmental benefits.

Those certificates can be claimed against any flight, even if the physical fuel uplift takes place elsewhere.

Revenue from buying certificates would be channeled into additional green aviation projects across Europe.

Because the mechanism decouples where SAF is burned from who pays, it reduces the incentive to exploit non-EU hubs solely to escape higher fuel costs. Deloitte argues the approach also avoids the legal hurdles of extending the EU’s existing Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)—currently applied to steel, cement, and other goods—to the aviation sector.

What this means for your next trip

For now, the numbers in the Deloitte model are projections, not hard-wired increases. Airlines typically hedge fuel purchases months in advance, and some have long-term SAF supply agreements that could buffer initial price shocks. Still, frequent flyers and vacation planners should watch how major European carriers respond in the run-up to 2030.

Tips for Travelers

Compare hubs: When shopping for long-haul tickets, check fares via EU airports such as Brussels, Frankfurt, or Paris against similar routings through Istanbul or Dubai. A small detour could save money, although it may add to the travel time.

Monitor fuel surcharges: Airlines often break out a “carrier-imposed surcharge” on your fare. Rising SAF costs may appear first here.

Leverage loyalty programs: If European airlines raise cash prices, redeeming frequent-flyer miles may offer better value than spending euros.

Watch for SAF opt-in programs: Some carriers already let passengers pay a bit extra to guarantee a portion of SAF on their flight. Participation could become mandatory later; locking in voluntary rates now may be more cost-effective.

Consider the carbon math: Even if a non-EU routing is cheaper, remember that extra connecting flights generally increase total emissions and travel time.

The bottom line for flyers

Europe is serious about decarbonizing aviation, but good intentions can collide with market realities. Unless policymakers fine-tune ReFuelEU—or adopt a SAF-BAM system—travelers may find themselves weighing higher prices for direct flights against longer, cheaper itineraries outside the bloc. Either way, understanding the forces reshaping the fare you pay will help you book smarter, greener trips in the years ahead.",https://jetsetterguide.com/sites/default/files/2024-02/AdobeStock_311641578.jpeg,N,,2025-07-23 12:56:20.088337

The paper details how Syzygy's NovaSAF™ platform offers a scalable, policy-aligned, and economically viable pathway to decarbonize aviation.

""NovaSAF™ is more than a product—it's a policy enabler,"" said Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics. ""This white paper shows how technology innovation can help regulators and industry meet climate goals while unlocking new economic opportunities.""

As global regulators accelerate efforts to reduce aviation emissions, SAF demand is expected to exceed 200 million metric tons annually by 2050. However, current supply falls short by more than 120 million metric tons. NovaSAF™ addresses this gap by converting biogenic methane and carbon dioxide into ASTM-certified SAF using light-activated catalysts and renewable electricity. This process reduces equipment costs, leverages widely available feedstocks, and delivers strong project returns. Altogether, this pathway is generally at or lower cost than HEFA and can even achieve Jet-A parity in the right scenarios.

Crucially, NovaSAF™ meets both SAF and eSAF (electrofuels) requirements under the EU's RED III directive and the UK's Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO). A NovaSAF plant will create SAF with two separate qualifications, a portion of the volume produced will qualify as an Advanced Biofuel, and the remaining portion will qualify as a Renewable Fuel of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO). This dual compliance enables access to premium SAF markets and supports long-term investment viability.

The paper highlights how NovaSAF is enabled by Syzygy's Rigel reactor technology, which is powered by renewable electricity and eliminates the need to combust fossil fuels. This critical piece is then combined with the well-established Fischer-Tropsch technology to turn the biogas into a liquid that can then be hydrotreated to create SAF. A final critical element are Syzygy's innovations around these technologies together into a modular system, which enables distributed, site-adaptable production.

It also features Syzygy's first commercial project, NovaSAF 1, located in Uruguay. This facility will convert manure from 14,000 cows into 400,000 gallons (1,100 tons) of SAF annually, powered by a national grid that is over 90 percent renewable. The project demonstrates the platform's scalability and its potential to reduce both methane and aviation-related emissions.

Syzygy's strategy focuses on scaling SAF production through repeatable project execution and technology licensing, aiming to meet the growing demand for low-carbon aviation fuels over the next 25 years.

Proposals will be assessed for their ability to achieve “reduction of sustainability-related risks and improvement of sustainability of markets” and “securing of market average return”.

A GPIF spokesperson told Responsible Investor that allocation size will depend on the RFP results.

The Luxembourg Finance Labelling Agency (LuxFLAG) has clarified to RI that changes to its ESG label’s eligibility criteria do not mean that European funds will no longer need to comply with the EU’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) to qualify for the label. In its updated guidance, LuxFLAG had stated that being classified as Article 8 or 9 under the regime is “no longer a prerequisite” for being eligible to the ESG label. “This adjustment supports LuxFLAG’s global outreach,” the agency said. However, LuxFLAG has clarified that this only refers to funds outside the scope of SFDR. “So far, our footprint is mostly European with few non-eligible requests because of the product jurisdiction,” a spokesperson said. “This criteria update will unlock these possibilities and will make eligible non-EU products from existing product manufacturers based outside the EU.”

Regarding the upcoming SFDR review, the spokesperson said LuxFLAG remains aligned with the framework “but believe a more inclusive and international approach is necessary to address the growing interest in credible, third-party sustainability labels”. They added that LuxFLAG is “highly likely” to adapt accordingly, should SFDR be reviewed.

Several changes have been made to LuxFLAG’s criteria “in line with evolving market practices and stakeholder expectations”. These include requiring asset managers of labelled products to be signatories of a “recognised” responsible investment framework and for ESG due diligence to be systematically integrated into the investment process for 100 percent of portfolio holdings, as well as refinements to the terminology for exclusions and engagement. The updates aim to ensure continued robustness, international alignment and improved accessibility for a broader range of financial products, LuxFLAG said.

The Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI) has urged the Japanese government to address its dependence on fossil fuel imports by accelerating its national transition strategy – called the Green Transformation (GX) strategy. A briefing from CBI warned that the reliance on hydrocarbons, particularly on natural gas, “has become a critical vulnerability amid escalating geopolitical instability” and is inconsistent with Japan’s 2050 net-zero target. The NGO also noted that the construction of new gas plants with the assumption that carbon capture, ammonia and hydrogen could be used to replace gas in the future is predicated on “transition pathways [that] are currently unproven and uncertain”.

European residential real estate companies are facing manageable transition risks up to 2030, although tighter environmental policies could increase debt “materially”, according to new analysis by S&P Global Ratings. The ratings agency said the passthrough of utility costs and diversification of asset portfolios have helped shield companies in the sample against the credit impact of climate transition risks over the past few years, but that more stringent regulation could result in a one-notch lower rating for 10 of the 15 firms assessed.

Europe’s success in decarbonising its energy sector is being offset by rising emissions from aviation, according to new analysis by Barclays. A note published by the bank found that aviation emits more CO2 than the power sectors of both France and Portugal, as the aviation industry refocuses its decarbonisation pathway from electric and hydrogen powered aircraft towards sustainable aviation fuel and offsets. “The fresh political and environmental situation that has arisen from the new US administration has seen European airlines question the lack of a level playing field between European airlines and global competitors,” the analysts said, noting industry scepticism over the energy sector’s ability to support the production of sufficient sustainable aviation fuel.",https://media.responsible-investor.com/uploads/2024/07/admin-ajax.jpeg,N,,2025-07-23 11:57:42.939308

This sentiment underscores the potential of this new white paper showing how technological advancements can align regulatory frameworks with industry needs, further supporting climate action and creating economic possibilities.

The Demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

With global regulators intensifying commitments to cut aviation emissions, the demand for SAF is projected to soar. By 2050, forecasts suggest a need exceeding 200 million metric tons of SAF annually. However, the currently available supply falls significantly short, with a gap of over 120 million metric tons. The NovaSAF™ initiative aims to address this critical shortfall. It converts biogenic methane and carbon dioxide into ASTM-certified SAF, utilizing innovative light-activated catalysts and renewable electricity. Such a method not only diminishes overall equipment costs but also takes advantage of widely accessible feedstocks and yields strong returns on projects.

A Cost-Effective Approach to SAF Production

One of the standout features of the NovaSAF™ process is its ability to deliver SAF at costs comparable to or below traditional hydrogenated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) technologies. This opens doors for potential scenarios where it can achieve cost parity with conventional jet fuels, such as Jet-A.

Regulatory Compliance and Market Access

NovaSAF™ successfully meets both SAF and eSAF (electrofuels) requirements as outlined by the European Union's RED III directive and the UK's Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO). The production from a NovaSAF plant will yield SAF with two separate classifications: an Advanced Biofuel and a Renewable Fuel of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO). This dual compliance grants access to premium SAF markets and strengthens the long-term viability of investments in sustainable fuel technology.

Powering NovaSAF™ with Renewable Energy

Central to the NovaSAF™ technology is Syzygy's Rigel reactor, which leverages renewable energy to eliminate fossil fuel combustion in the production process. This advancement pairs seamlessly with established Fischer-Tropsch technology, which transforms biogas into liquid fuels suitable for further processing into SAF. Notably, the integration of these technologies into a modular system enhances the adaptability of production sites, making them capable of delivering localized solutions.

First Commercial Project and Future Prospects

Highlighting the practical applications of NovaSAF™, the paper discusses Syzygy's inaugural commercial project, NovaSAF 1. This innovative facility, situated in a region with over 90 percent renewable energy, will transform manure produced by 14,000 cows into 400,000 gallons (1,100 tons) of SAF annually. This project not only demonstrates the scalability of the NovaSAF™ platform but also promises to mitigate both methane emissions and those associated with aviation.

Syzygy's strategic commitment centers on increasing the production of SAF through consistent project execution and technology licensing. The company aims to meet the burgeoning demand for low-carbon aviation fuels over the forthcoming 25 years, ensuring that its sustainable solutions are both economically and environmentally sound.

The updates aimed to reduce the carbon intensity of the state’s transportation fuel by 30% by 2030 and by 90% by 2045, the 8 July report said.
“Implementing the 1 July effective date for the LCFS provides critical certainty to industry, as well as the LCFS credit market,” said CARB Board Chair Liane Randolph.
CARB said the amendments would reduce GHG emissions by 558M tonnes between 2025 and 2045.

The updates aimed to reduce the carbon intensity of the state’s transportation fuel by 30% by 2030 and by 90% by 2045, the 8 July report said.

Other changes to the LCFS programme included a requirement for fuel producers to track crop-based and forestry-based feedstocks to their point of origin; independent feedstock certification to ensure biomass-based diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstocks are not undermining natural carbon stocks; a halt to palm-derived fuels receiving credits; and a cap on the use of soyabean oil, canola oil and sunflower oil in the production of LCFS-compliant biodiesel diesel fuels, Biodiesel magazine wrote.

The amended regulation focuses public and private sector investment towards increasing cleaner fuel and transportation options for Californians, accelerating the deployment of zero-emission infrastructure and helping the state achieve legally mandated air quality and climate targets, CARB said on 27 June.

“Implementing the 1 July effective date for the LCFS provides critical certainty to industry, as well as the LCFS credit market,” said CARB Board Chair Liane Randolph.

“But often lost in the noise around this programme are our primary reasons for approving it: better health for Californians, our economy and the environment, as well as achieving required state and federal air quality standards.”

The LCFS reduces air pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by setting a declining target for the carbon in transportation fuels used in California; producers that do not meet established benchmarks buy credits from others that do.

CARB said the amendments would reduce GHG emissions by 558M tonnes between 2025 and 2045.

Since its introduction, the LCFS had reduced the carbon in California’s fuel mix by almost 13% and replaced 75% of the diesel used in the state with cleaner alternatives, displacing 320M tonnes of CO2 since 2011, the board added.

California consumes most of the renewable diesel produced in the USA, with the fuel making up nearly 65% of its transportation distillate consumption in the third quarter of 2024, according to US Energy Information Administration (EIA) data.

In November 2024, renewable diesel production on the US West Coast (including California, Oregon and Washington) exceeded 90,000 barrels/day, nearly four times the volume in 2023, with refiners such as Marathon Martinez and Phillips 66 Rodel significantly expanding capacity, Mansfield Energy wrote on 3 March.",https://www.ofimagazine.com/content-images/news/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/Biofuel-Adobe-Stock-sized-23-Sept.jpg?mtime=1723017510,N,,2025-07-23 11:57:54.183622

This year, there are a record number of thermal biomass projects, ranging from support for existing and new small wood pellet plants making pellets for domestic heating, expansion of firewood businesses, larger biomass thermal heating plants, etc. Of the $80 million, at least $12 million went to more than 30 projects in 19 states that involved thermal biomass applications. In addition, quite a few projects include biomass to electricity.

""Firewood, pellets and wood chips - these are domestic renewable energy sources that America needs for heating our homes, institutions and businesses,"" said John Ackerly, President of the Alliance for Green Heat. ""They help take strain off of our electric grids, they are affordable for rural communities and sustainable.""

The Alliance for Green Heat was not eligible for funding for firewood bank assistance through this grant process but has been advocating for an extension of the funding established through a Congressional earmark.

The program was founded in 2015, under President Obama, in part to mitigate the impacts of climate change, as wildfires began to increase. It also sought to assist using low grade wood as an energy source. Overall, it has supported the forestry industry in many ways, but from its founding in 2015 until 2021, the budget was relatively small, around $8 million. As of 2022, as wildfire risks became even greater, and with funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, funding began to climb rapidly and reached $74 million last year.

The $80 million announced July 17 includes grants under three programs:

The Wood Innovations Grant Program supports projects that expand the use of wood products, including firewood and pellets

The Community Wood Grant Program helps fund ready-to-go, local projects that use wood for heat and energy.

The Wood Products Infrastructure Assistance Program funds facilities that purchase and process byproducts from forest restoration projects from federal or tribal lands.

Stefano Domenicali, President and CEO of Formula 1, said in the report: “We are strongly committed to achieving net zero by 2030.
The sport’s global fanbase has grown to more than 826 million and race attendance has reached more than six million.
How can you look at the solutions that work in Formula 1, at mass events with hundreds of thousands of people, globally?
Alongside this, Ellen feels that F1 is uniquely set up to support the development and amplification of new technologies.","Formula 1’s Sustainability Update 2025 says that the organisation is on track to reach its goal of net zero by 2030.

It has achieved a 26% reduction in carbon emissions at the end of 2024 compared to its 2018 baseline.

Over the same period, race attendance has grown from four million to 6.5 million and F1’s global fanbase is now more than 826 million.

If no changes had been made to operations, F1 estimates that there would have been a 10% increase in its carbon footprint.

Stefano Domenicali, President and CEO of Formula 1, said in the report: “We are strongly committed to achieving net zero by 2030. It is a concrete goal, already visible in the significant reduction of our sport’s carbon footprint.

“Formula 1 has always been synonymous with innovation and the desire to improve.

“Once again, this mentality has allowed us to make important progress, not only for those who work in this world, but also for society as a whole.”

Driving sustainability at Formula 1

Ellen Jones, Head of ESG at Formula 1, leads the business’ sustainability strategy.

She joined the business in 2022 with previous experience from Pret A Manger and Accenture.

Ellen earned a BA in Architecture from Yale University and an MS in Sustainable Environmental Design from the Architectural Association School of Architecture.

“Not only do I get to work in the wonderful four walls of Formula 1 management, looking at broadcast and logistics, but I also get to work across our sport with F1 teams, our race promoters who are event hosts and our broadcasters,” Ellen tells Sustainability Magazine.

“What we have tried to do as a sport is ask how we can take climate action now and explore how we can do so much more together, whether that's through partnerships or through shared solutions.

“It's a real balance of individual activity within the organisations that make up our sport, as well as shared activity across the stakeholders who all love the races.”

Behind F1’s 2030 net zero goal

By 2030, F1 aims to reach net zero against a 2018 baseline with a minimum 50% emissions reduction target.

“Being Formula 1, we want to beat that number,” Ellen says.

“When we do exhaust the reductions phase, we will look at what are credible offsets at that time.”

She explains: “In our sustainability strategy, you have things that are different from a normal bricks and mortar because it's about the relationships that we have across the sport.

“We also look to make a unique contribution as Formula 1 by developing road relevant solutions. You see that in our cars with hybrid engines and you'll see that in our cars in 2026 with advanced sustainable fuel.

“How those two cross pollinate is what I find fascinating. How we innovate on track and how that culture, mindset and knowledge of the technical innovation space helps us innovate off track.”

Influencing global sustainability

Formula 1’s unique position in sustainability also extends to its influence and fans.

The sport’s global fanbase has grown to more than 826 million and race attendance has reached more than six million.

“From our side, we have two different conversations when you talk about the platform,” Ellen explains.

“One is a B2C conversation with our fans about being part of something bigger and supporting change by being at a Formula 1 race. You're part of this progression that's able to happen.

“The second is a B2B conversation. How do we talk to businesses about what solutions you can integrate today? How can you look at the solutions that work in Formula 1, at mass events with hundreds of thousands of people, globally?

“If we can do that across those contexts and give case studies of what works, then hopefully it can inspire other businesses to say ‘if this works for Formula 1, it can work for us’.”

Challenges and opportunities for sustainability in F1

Reducing emissions by 26% brings F1 more than halfway to its goal of reducing emissions 50%, but more needs to be done yet.

Ellen explains that F1, like many businesses, faces challenges in changing mindsets on sustainability.

However, with a history tied to burning race fuel and shredding rubber, perceptions in motorsport could be harder to change.

“Sustainability and performance are better delivered together and we have those examples within F1 every day showing that when you build sustainability from the front into your strategy, you're not making compromises on what is delivered,” she says.

Despite an increase in both number of events and attendance, F1 has achieved a 12% reduction in its average per-event energy emissions showing that growth and emissions can be decoupled.

Alongside this, Ellen feels that F1 is uniquely set up to support the development and amplification of new technologies.

“You have to look at if it can scale, making sure it’s available in different markets and marking sure customers and auditors understand that technology and how it’s implemented,” Ellen explains.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/45e209580b4c1a8bab87753e64facfb5:5242e14c99471e02aefb71c8b25b43b1/ellen-jones-head-of-esg-at-formula-1.webp.jpg,N,,2025-07-23 11:58:03.831913

Integration with other Essar Energy Transition businesses—EET Fuels, EET Hydrogen, and EET Hydrogen Power—will further support Stanlow’s evolution into a leading energy transition complex.
The mandate sets phased targets, requiring 22% of aviation fuel to come from SAF by 2040—up from just 2% today.","Essar Energy Transition (EET), a key player in the UK's decarbonisation landscape, has secured £2.5 million in funding from the UK Government’s Department for Transport (DfT) under its Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF). This financial backing is designated to advance EET's vision of creating one of the UK’s largest advanced Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production hubs at Stanlow, Cheshire. The facility is a core element of EET’s strategy to transform Stanlow into the world’s first low-carbon process refinery.

The project will centre around the development of a Methanol-to-Jet (MtJ) SAF production hub, which is expected to produce up to 200,000 tonnes of advanced SAF annually. The plant will rely on approximately 550,000 tonnes of renewable e-methanol and bio-methanol each year, sourced both from within the UK and internationally. A portion of this methanol will be supplied by Essar Future Energies, a sister company currently developing a renewable methanol project in Gujarat, India.

With a feasibility study successfully completed earlier in 2025, the new grant will allow the project to progress to the Pre-Front-End Engineering Design (pre-FEED) stage. This phase is scheduled for completion by March 2026, followed by the start of the full Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) in Q2 2026. Essar anticipates reaching a Final Investment Decision (FID) by the end of 2027.

Stanlow’s strategic location offers several advantages, including the presence of existing import infrastructure at Stanlow Terminals. This enables access to competitively priced, low-carbon-intensity methanol feedstocks. The site also benefits from existing refining capabilities, along with upcoming low-carbon power, hydrogen production, and carbon capture infrastructure, allowing for a fully integrated low-emission SAF facility.

The SAF produced at this hub will be distributed through Essar’s extensive jet fuel logistics network, which includes the Manchester Jet Line, Midlands and UKOP pipelines, as well as road and marine routes. This system currently supplies fuel to 10 UK airports, including Manchester International, positioning the facility as a key direct supplier to the UK aviation industry. SAF will be blended on-site with existing jet fuel supplies to ensure seamless integration into the current distribution network.

Moreover, the Stanlow hub is designed with scalability in mind. As SAF demand increases in the coming decades, the site offers potential for significant expansion. Integration with other Essar Energy Transition businesses—EET Fuels, EET Hydrogen, and EET Hydrogen Power—will further support Stanlow’s evolution into a leading energy transition complex.

EET Managing Director Tony Fountain expressed strong support for the government’s role in enabling this transition, stating that domestic SAF production is crucial for aviation decarbonisation and national Jet Zero goals. The MtJ hub will be instrumental in closing the gap in global SAF supply, which remains a small fraction of total jet fuel use.

The initiative aligns with the UK’s SAF Mandate, which came into effect in January 2025. The mandate sets phased targets, requiring 22% of aviation fuel to come from SAF by 2040—up from just 2% today. This MtJ project will help EET meet its own SAF obligations under the mandate by 2035. The £2.5m grant is part of a broader £63 million AFF allocation for SAF projects between July 2025 and March 2026, with further government incentives and policy support expected to follow.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-23 11:58:43.634858

Work published in the journal ACS Sustainable Resource Management examines a hypothetical biomass-to-sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) process to demonstrate how GHG accounting requirements drive estimates of biofuel CI and to explore potential CI and financial implications of scenario-specific life cycle assessment (LCA).

The CI of hypothetical SAF produced from miscanthus via the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) pathway was calculated according to specifications from three low-carbon fuel policies (U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), Canada Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR), and California Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), and the 45Z tax credit.

These were compared against modeling results tailored to specific feedstock-to-fuel scenarios (scenario-specific LCA) defined by feedstock and facility siting and feedstock split ratio (the proportion of miscanthus allocated to fuel production vs. electricity).

GHG accounting using the CFR/LCFS can reasonably account for distinct levels of net electricity production by a biorefinery, but only the CFR yields similar CI sensitivity to spatially explicit factors as scenario-specific LCA. Most GHG accounting frameworks do not capture CI variation across candidate sites in the United States.

This work demonstrates the importance of LCA methodological specifications in low-carbon fuel policies and tax credits and illustrates that policies that enable scenario-specific CI calculations could enhance crediting accuracy and more effectively support the implementation of low-emission practices.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/aviation.jpg,N,,2025-07-23 11:58:50.771785

This funding is designated to support the advancement of LanzaTech’s pivotal DRAGON 1 and DRAGON 2 projects—two initiatives aimed at transforming the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) landscape in the UK. The DRAGON initiative, which stands for Decarbonizing and Reimagining Aviation for the Goal Of Netzero, is central to the UK’s goal of achieving a cleaner and more sustainable aviation sector.

The DRAGON 1 project is LanzaTech’s existing SAF development located in Port Talbot, South Wales. This facility converts recycled carbon fuel ethanol—some of which is produced through LanzaTech’s proprietary gas fermentation technology—into advanced sustainable aviation fuel using the LanzaJet® Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) process. This ethanol-to-SAF pathway is gaining recognition as one of the most effective and scalable solutions for decarbonizing air travel.

DRAGON 2 represents the next step in LanzaTech’s SAF ambitions. It will be a Power-to-Liquid (PtL) facility that synthesizes ethanol from captured carbon dioxide and green hydrogen. This ethanol will then be processed into SAF at a neighboring site using the same LanzaJet® AtJ technology. The specific location for DRAGON 2 is yet to be finalized and will be determined during the course of this grant-funded phase.

What sets these projects apart is the integration of LanzaTech’s carbon recycling platform with LanzaJet’s conversion technology. By utilizing locally sourced waste carbon and renewable hydrogen, the combined approach delivers SAF with a significantly lower Carbon Intensity (CI). This not only supports the UK’s SAF Mandate but also promotes industrial revitalization, job creation, and regional economic growth.

Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech, emphasized the significance of this funding: “The future of aviation fuel lies in ethanol-to-SAF solutions, and LanzaTech is leading this transition. The UK government’s backing reinforces our pioneering role and strengthens our mission to create a circular carbon economy for aviation. DRAGON 1 and 2 demonstrate how bold, innovative projects can drive global progress in SAF.”

The government’s financial support underscores confidence in LanzaTech’s technology and the broader potential for waste-based SAF production. This vote of confidence comes in tandem with recognition for Project Speedbird, another LanzaJet-led initiative in which LanzaTech holds a 36% stake. Project Speedbird received £10 million in AFF funding, further highlighting the UK’s strong alignment with LanzaTech and LanzaJet’s strategies.

In 2024, LanzaTech and LanzaJet jointly launched CirculAir™, a comprehensive SAF platform that converts various forms of waste carbon—including CO2, municipal solid waste, and agricultural residues—into jet fuel. This collaboration expands the potential of SAF globally and offers a scalable, waste-based solution to the aviation industry's climate challenges.

With this latest round of funding, total investments from the AFF have reached £198 million, showcasing the UK’s robust support for clean aviation innovations. The funding spans multiple SAF pathways and feedstocks, reflecting a diversified and inclusive approach toward achieving net-zero emissions.

On Monday 21 July, Aviation Minister Mike Kane MP visited the university to announce the funding. Sheffield will lead a £1.5 million initiative aimed at commercialising its novel SAF technology and encouraging investment in future production facilities to boost the availability of the cleaner fuel.

The scheme, known as NextGen-SAF, brings together a partnership of international and UK-based organisations, including Fuel Cell Energy (USA), Green Lizard Technologies (UK), Drax Power (UK), IMI Vivo (Italy), Gardner Consulting (UK), and Leeds Bradford Airport (UK). The project has also garnered backing from major players such as Airbus, Boeing, Qatar Airways, and the City of Doncaster Council.

While SAF is often made from organic or waste materials, concerns remain over whether those resources can be scaled to meet demand. The University of Sheffield’s new method bypasses these limitations by using renewable energy in tandem with advanced carbon capture systems to create fuel.

This innovative approach, known as Power to Liquid (PtL), involves producing hydrogen through renewable electricity and capturing carbon dioxide from industrial sources or the atmosphere. These are combined to form synthetic hydrocarbons, which are then refined into usable aviation fuel.

Not only could this technique make SAF more cost-effective, but it also allows greater flexibility and the potential to cut emissions across industrial sectors.

NextGen-SAF will create a pioneering demonstration plant that integrates two core technologies: a Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) and an Advanced Fischer-Tropsch (AFT) reactor. Together, these systems will generate hydrogen, capture CO2, and synthesise hydrocarbons, offering a fully integrated route to SAF production. The goal is to prove the system’s efficiency, stability, and scalability.

“We are proud to lead this project, made possible by this vital funding, to develop a new and innovative SAF production pathway. Sustainable Aviation Fuel is essential to reducing emissions from the aviation industry, and through this project we are taking a major step toward scaling up SAF production right here in the UK. This initiative not only advances the UK’s goals around SAF but also strengthens the nation’s fuel production capabilities and will deliver lasting economic benefits.”

Professor Koen Lamberts, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sheffield.

The Sheffield project is one of 17 receiving a share of £63 million in government funding to speed up SAF development.

“This £63 million is lift-off for Britain’s green aviation revolution. We’re not just backing brilliant British innovation; we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market.

From the labs of Sheffield to the runways of the future – this is how we kickstart economic growth, secure energy independence, and make Britain a clean energy superpower.”

Mike Kane, Aviation Minister.

Sheffield has earned a global reputation for its SAF research, hosting some of Europe’s top clean energy facilities at its Energy Innovation Centre. These include pilot-scale systems designed to support industry and academic partnerships in trialling cutting-edge low-carbon technologies.

The University is also home to the UK SAF Clearing House, one of only two such centres worldwide, which helps fuel developers meet the strict certification standards required for aviation use.

Sheffield’s expertise was also instrumental in the world’s first transatlantic flight powered by SAF, during which its researchers measured the impact of the fuel on emissions and contrail formation. Their analysis revealed emission cuts of up to 70 per cent.

“It is fantastic to see the University of Sheffield playing a leading role in the development of sustainable aviation fuel and supporting the aviation industry in its efforts to reduce its emissions. At Sheffield we have some of the most advanced SAF research facilities in Europe and are excited to work with partners from the industry to help them test and develop new fuels and next generation clean energy technologies.”

Fuels giant Essar Energy Transition (EET) is to develop one of the UK’s largest sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production hubs close to the River Mersey.

EET operates the second-largest oil refinery in the UK at Stanlow in Ellesmere Port. It already supplies conventional jet fuel via either road or pipeline to 10 UK airports including Liverpool and Manchester.

SAF is jet fuel produced from a variety of sources including household waste, used cooking oil as well as forestry and agricultural waste. Because it is a ‘drop-in fuel’ it means it can be blended with conventional jet fuel without any modifications.

Powering aircraft is one of the big conundrums of the push towards cutting CO2 emissions. A commercial airliner requires significant power to take off and travel long distances.

There have been trials using both batteries and hydrogen but so far these have proven challenging. SAF is currently seen as the best way to keep flying but reduce emissions.

It is claimed SAF can reduce emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel although critics say it simply shifts some of those emissions to other parts of the supply chain. SAF is also more expensive.

EET has secured £2.5m from the Government to establish an SAF hub at Stanlow. It plans to use methanol-to-jet technology to convert renewable e-methanol and bio-methanol into SAF. Stanlow is also the nerve centre for the multi-billion pound HyNet hydrogen project.

Leveraging Stanlow Terminals existing import infrastructure enables access to low carbon intensity methanol feedstocks. SAF will be blended on-site with EET Fuels’ existing jet fuel production to directly supply UK airports.

This hub will have the capacity to produce 200,000 tonnes a year if SAF, using 550,000 tonnes of renewable e-methanol and bio-methanol sourced domestically in the UK and from its sister company – Essar Future Energies – in Gujarat, India.

The Department for Transport has offered the funding from its £63m Advanced Fuels Fund. EET can now advance to the pre-front-end engineering design (pre-FEED) stage. It is targeting completion of pre-FEED by March 2026, with full FEED commencing in Q2 2026 and final investment decision by the end of 2027.

The plant will be located in the Liepāja Special Economic Zone (LSEZ), Latvia, through the newly formed joint venture NorSAF, in collaboration with local partners.

The NorSAF facility is expected to begin operations in 2030, delivering up to 100,000 tonnes of SAF annually.

Estimated investment in the project ranges between €500 million and €600 million, with financial backing sought from EU funds, institutional investors, and public sector stakeholders.

The plant will serve both regional airlines and global markets, supporting the growing demand for low-emission aviation solutions.

The EU mandates that SAF must make up at least 2% of jet fuel usage at airports in 2025, increasing to 6% by 2030, 20% by 2035, and reaching 70% by 2050. This regulation reflects the urgent need for cleaner fuel sources in aviation, an industry under increasing pressure to meet stringent emissions targets.

Gediminas Ziemelis, Chairman of Avia Solutions Group, stressed the strategic importance of the project: “The current global supply of sustainable aviation fuel is far from sufficient to meet the regulatory and commercial demand anticipated in the coming years. Our new facility in Liepāja will be vital in securing supply chains for the future of green aviation.”

The plant will utilise PureSAF technology, developed by Swedish Biofuels and licensed exclusively to US engineering company KBR.

This technology has demonstrated greenhouse gas emissions reductions of up to 93% compared to fossil-based jet fuel. Importantly, it also allows for the production of eSAF, a synthetic version of SAF made using renewable electricity, green hydrogen, and captured carbon dioxide.

By 2030, EU regulations will require 1.2% of all SAF supplied to be synthetic, a share that will increase to 50% by 2050. The NorSAF plant’s integrated production model will meet both bio-based and synthetic SAF targets by combining bioethanol, green hydrogen generated via electrolysis and captured CO₂.

Vytautas Cekanavičius, CEO of Baltic Ground Services and NorSAF board member, noted: “We are developing a full green energy cycle – powering electrolysis with renewable electricity to generate hydrogen, then combining it with bioethanol and recycled CO₂ to produce SAF and eSAF. This makes our approach both sustainable and scalable.”

The site was selected for its strategic advantages, including existing infrastructure such as gas pipelines, railway access, ethanol handling facilities and plans for a nearby green hydrogen plant. Discussions are ongoing with potential suppliers of CO₂ to support the synthetic fuel production process.

A feasibility study conducted by KBR is due to be completed in late 2025, with construction expected to commence by 2027. According to Jānis Kisiels, board member at NorSAF, project timelines are on track:

“We are working closely with investors, suppliers and EU institutions to begin construction within two years. This facility positions Latvia at the forefront of the SAF industry while contributing to energy independence and green growth.”

Currently, the Baltic States consume approximately 400,000 tonnes of aviation fuel annually. Under the EU’s current 2% SAF mandate, the regional demand stands at just 8,000 tonnes. With its planned capacity, the Liepāja plant will not only meet local needs but also provide surplus SAF for export, making it a critical hub in Europe’s green aviation network.",https://tankterminals.com/wp-content/themes/tankterminals/src/img/favicon/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-07-23 06:57:49.151731

Europe stands at a critical juncture in its journey toward a net zero aviation future. A recent unified appeal from stakeholders across the aviation and fuel industries signals both an opportunity and a challenge. The call is simple but urgent: policy makers must strengthen and accelerate support for the deployment of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, to meet the region’s climate ambitions.

While SAF remains a key lever for reducing the carbon footprint of air transport, its market development is still in its infancy. The only commercially viable option today—HEFA-based fuels—continues to face stiff cost competition from conventional kerosene. Meanwhile, next-generation options such as e-SAF and advanced biofuels are struggling to move from concept to investment reality.

Why the Industry Is Coming Together Now

Aviation associations, fuel suppliers, airports, and cargo operators have coalesced to issue a ten-point policy action plan aimed at catalysing the SAF market. Their message is clear: while the regulatory architecture exists in the form of the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, it is insufficient by itself. Legal mandates provide the structure, but financial and market support mechanisms are needed to provide the necessary scale and cost-efficiency.

The upcoming Sustainable Transport Investment Plan from the European Commission, due this autumn, is seen as a crucial moment to integrate these support mechanisms and align institutional strategy with commercial and environmental urgency.

The Cost Conundrum and Investment Gap

Even as the aviation sector commits to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, SAF developers face significant hurdles in securing long-term financing. In particular, the high upfront risk and capital requirements of SAF production technologies such as e-SAF make final investment decisions elusive.

The challenge is two-fold:

Bridging the cost gap between SAF and fossil-based kerosene.

Unlocking investment in infrastructure and technology at a pace fast enough to meet regulatory milestones.

Without market certainty and reliable demand signals, developers of innovative fuel technologies are unlikely to make the leap from pilot to plant.

Ten Actions for a Stronger SAF Ecosystem

The action plan presented to EU officials outlines a mix of regulatory, financial, and market-based measures to correct early-mover disadvantages and catalyse broader SAF uptake. Highlights include:

Extending SAF eligibility under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme in both volume and duration.

Launching dedicated funding calls for SAF innovation under existing EU instruments, including the Innovation Fund and the European Investment Bank.

Introducing a revenue certainty tool to mitigate offtake risks and encourage production commitments.

Developing a virtual ticketing mechanism to support SAF attribute trading, enhancing market liquidity and price transparency.

Reducing administrative burdens for smaller SAF producers and startups to help level the playing field.

These actions aim not just to address existing challenges, but to engineer a self-sustaining SAF value chain that balances investment risk with environmental reward.

Ensuring Equity and Regional Balance

A particularly compelling dimension of the industry’s call is the emphasis on equitable SAF access across European regions. As Montserrat Barriga of the European Regions Airline Association noted, uneven SAF distribution may skew public perception and exacerbate reputational disparities between operators.

Policy measures, therefore, must consider not only scale and cost but also inclusiveness—ensuring that regional carriers and less-developed airports are not left behind in the transition.

From Regulation to Strategy

The sentiment from industry is that SAF deployment cannot be addressed in isolation. It must be integrated into a holistic aviation strategy that spans aircraft innovation, air traffic management modernisation, and carbon removals. By broadening the lens, Europe can move from fragmented support to cohesive leadership in sustainable aviation.

The call for action represents more than an industry wish list—it is a roadmap for systemic change.

Conclusion: Why This Moment Matters

The aviation sector is not merely asking for policy favours. It is offering a vision where regulation, finance, and innovation align to create a high-growth, low-carbon fuel economy. This vision rests on the understanding that climate goals must be achieved in tandem with economic resilience and connectivity across Europe.

For stakeholders committed to sustainable mobility, this is the moment to watch. The coming months will likely determine whether Europe leads the SAF transition or lags behind global competitors.

As the conversation unfolds, it is important for all sectors—from technology to transport—to stay engaged and proactive. Cross-industry collaboration will be essential to turn policy frameworks into scalable solutions that redefine the future of flight.

Be part of the global conversation on decarbonising flight.

“Nebraska remains a national leader in biofuel production and is a driving global leader in advancing the bioeconomy,” Flood said. “SAF represents just one of many promising ways to grow the biofuels sector and boost our rural communities. Our straightforward, commonsense bill requires the EIA to include SAF in its published data, giving industry leaders and stakeholders better insight into production trends. I’m grateful to my colleague for partnering with me once again to support the growth of the SAF industry.”

“Without coordinated action between government and industry, greenhouse gas emissions will continue to increase as more people and goods fly through our skies,” Carter added. “Sustainable aviation fuel is an exciting, new green fuel that’s creating jobs in Louisiana. I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation to ensure America is on track to meet the growing demand for cleaner transportation and healthier communities.”

Supporters of the SAF Information Act include the Advanced Biofuels Association, American Farm Bureau Federation, American Soybean Association, American Sugar Cane League, Greater New Orleans Inc., Growth Energy, Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation, National Corn Growers Association, National Oilseed Producers Association, Nebraska Corn Growers Association, Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation, Nebraska Soybean Association, Renewable Fuels Association, Renewable Fuels Nebraska, and the SAF Coalition.

“As we work to speed up the development and deployment of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), real-time production and supply updates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration will offer crucial insights,” said Alison Graab, executive director for the SAF Coalition. These updates will play a key role in effectively scaling up SAF across the country.”

“Transparent and timely market data are critically important to help the nascent SAF industry get off the ground, said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the RFA. “This legislation would ensure SAF producers and users have the information they need to make informed decisions and smart investments. The Renewable Fuels Association thanks Reps. Flood and Carter for their leadership on this issue and we strongly support their legislation,”

""America's farmers and biofuel producers will only be able to lead in global markets for clean fuels if we have reliable data to help guide investment decisions and measure our progress,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “Rep. Flood's bill is common sense and will lay the groundwork for new jobs and new investments, while giving the U.S. a way to track its path toward becoming the world leader in SAF production.”

“The Advanced Biofuels Association is proud to endorse the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Information Act and to play an important part in our nation’s energy dominance agenda,” said Michael McAdams, President of the Advanced Biofuels Association. “Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), also known as synthetic aviation fuel, is an in-demand U.S. energy export that is the latest in a long tradition of American renewable fuel innovations. This legislation will improve data streams from the U.S. Energy Information Administration that help our domestic farmers and biorefiners make informed decisions to increase SAF production levels.”

A new study by Deloitte for airlines for Europe, published recently on Green Air News, raised concerns that the ReFuelEU mandate, which requires increasing the use of sustainable aviation fuel, may drive passengers toward non-EU carriers and destinations that are not bound by the same environmental regulations.

The report warned that this could result in carbon and business leakage, undermining both climate goals and market fairness.

Deloitte estimated that ReFuelEU could increase cost disparities by up to 15 per cent on key EU–Asia routes by 2030.

As a solution, the study proposes a SAF Book and Claim Accounting Mechanism, which it said could help maintain a level playing field without raising overall prices for consumers.

The report identified the main types of leakage caused by the current policy framework including passengers choosing non-EU hubs like Istanbul or Dubai over EU hubs such as Paris or Frankfurt to avoid SAF costs; travelers opting for indirect routes outside the EU, since ReFuelEU applies only to the first flight segment departing from the EU; and EU travelers selecting non-EU holiday spots to avoid EU ETS costs, and non-EU residents bypassing EU destinations altogether.

While the EU already has a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism to price the carbon content of imports like cement and steel from countries with weaker climate rules, discussions are underway to possibly extend CBAM to aviation.

However, a 2024 analysis by Ishka notes this is complicated by the upcoming 2026 review of ICAO’s CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), which will assess whether the scheme aligns with the Paris Agreement targets.

The Deloitte report argued that applying CBAM to aviation is “neither legally nor practically feasible,” and called for a tailored solution for international air travel emissions.

The proposed SAF-BAM system, it said, should be established through EU legislation and enforced by national authorities.

It was added that the mechanism would rely on integrating passenger data with flight operations data to calculate SAF use per passenger and per flight segment.

“Revenue generated from the sale of SAF-BAM certificates could be dedicated to further support the aviation sector, including green transition projects,” the report added.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/15001652/European-Union-.jpg,N,,2025-07-23 01:18:32.319956

These regulations set ambitious targets to be fulfilled by aviation fuel suppliers; but given the expected high cost of SAF and the immature state of the industry, it is far from certain that sufficient fuel production capacity will be developed in time to hit near-term targets. It is anyway likely that there will be political pressure to reduce long-term targets.

Complementary policies have been developed to provide financial support to SAF on a ‘per litre’ basis, with the aim of facilitating uptake and/or production. The EU’s reimbursement scheme mitigates the cost to airlines for each unit of alternative fuel they consume by reimbursing some fraction of the cost difference compared to fossil kerosene. The UK’s guaranteed strike price (GSP), on the other hand, offers a Government-backed mechanism to shield SAF producers from variability in market prices, thereby establishing certainty over revenues and de-risking investment. The GSP seeks to provide reassurance to investors in early-stage commercial projects, facilitating finance availability in a way that is hoped to be effective in jump-starting production and reducing the cost of capital.

This report examines the SAF policy frameworks in the two regions and reviews their strengths and weaknesses. It finds that while the EU’s and the UK’s frameworks are currently the strongest incentives for SAF deployment in the world, both face challenges and the structure and targeting of their complementary support mechanisms will deliver diverging outcomes. We anticipate that the EU’s reimbursement scheme will primarily benefit airlines and reduce the costs to flyers, it will do little to provide a durable price signal to motivate more challenging second-generation fuel producers to enter the market; in contrast the UK’s GSP delivers clear and stable price certainty to fuel producers and is more likely to stimulate investment in the SAF industry.",https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_1465494506-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-23 01:18:36.111357

“Nebraska remains a national leader in biofuel production and is a driving global leader in advancing the bioeconomy,” Flood said. “SAF represents just one of many promising ways to grow the biofuels sector and boost our rural communities. Our straightforward, commonsense bill requires the EIA to include SAF in its published data, giving industry leaders and stakeholders better insight into production trends. I’m grateful to my colleague for partnering with me once again to support the growth of the SAF industry.”

“Without coordinated action between government and industry, greenhouse gas emissions will continue to increase as more people and goods fly through our skies,” Carter added. “Sustainable aviation fuel is an exciting, new green fuel that’s creating jobs in Louisiana. I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation to ensure America is on track to meet the growing demand for cleaner transportation and healthier communities.”

Supporters of the SAF Information Act include the Advanced Biofuels Association, American Farm Bureau Federation, American Soybean Association, American Sugar Cane League, Greater New Orleans Inc., Growth Energy, Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation, National Corn Growers Association, National Oilseed Producers Association, Nebraska Corn Growers Association, Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation, Nebraska Soybean Association, Renewable Fuels Association, Renewable Fuels Nebraska, and the SAF Coalition.

“As we work to speed up the development and deployment of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), real-time production and supply updates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration will offer crucial insights,” said Alison Graab, executive director for the SAF Coalition. These updates will play a key role in effectively scaling up SAF across the country.”

“Transparent and timely market data are critically important to help the nascent SAF industry get off the ground, said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the RFA. “This legislation would ensure SAF producers and users have the information they need to make informed decisions and smart investments. The Renewable Fuels Association thanks Reps. Flood and Carter for their leadership on this issue and we strongly support their legislation,”

""America's farmers and biofuel producers will only be able to lead in global markets for clean fuels if we have reliable data to help guide investment decisions and measure our progress,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “Rep. Flood's bill is common sense and will lay the groundwork for new jobs and new investments, while giving the U.S. a way to track its path toward becoming the world leader in SAF production.”

“The Advanced Biofuels Association is proud to endorse the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Information Act and to play an important part in our nation’s energy dominance agenda,” said Michael McAdams, President of the Advanced Biofuels Association. “Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), also known as synthetic aviation fuel, is an in-demand U.S. energy export that is the latest in a long tradition of American renewable fuel innovations. This legislation will improve data streams from the U.S. Energy Information Administration that help our domestic farmers and biorefiners make informed decisions to increase SAF production levels.”

17 UK companies developing sustainable aviation fuel to receive share of new £63 million funding boost, supporting around 1,400 jobs

latest investment builds on this year’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) drive, which will help position the UK as the world leader in homegrown sustainable aviation fuel production

latest investment supports greenlighting of multiple airport expansion schemes to kickstart economic growth and deliver on our Plan for Change

Passengers are a step closer to greener flights as the Aviation Minister today (22 July 2025) announced the 17 cutting-edge UK companies that will share £63 million to accelerate sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

The boost will support around 1,400 jobs and secure Britain’s position as the global leader in the green aviation market – critical to provide the clean fuel that’s essential to realise sustainable growth in the aviation sector.

Today’s investment means government has provided £198 million to date through the Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF) to scale up cleaner aviation technologies. Creating a clean aviation ecosystem will help power the next generation of airport infrastructure and capacity scale up, kickstarting economic growth and delivering the UK’s clean energy superpower ambitions to deliver on the Plan for Change.

Low carbon fuel production could add up to £5 billion to the economy by 2050, position the UK as a global hub for SAF production and enable the UK to go further and faster with expansion plans.

Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, said:

This £63 million is lift off for Britain’s green aviation revolution.

We’re not just backing brilliant British innovation, we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market.

From the labs of Sheffield to the runways of the future – this is how we kickstart economic growth, secure energy independence and make Britain a clean energy superpower.

SAF is an alternative to fossil jet fuel which reduces greenhouse gas emissions on average by 70% on a lifecycle basis, from feedstock to biofuel, making it the key technology that will allow UK aviation to grow capacity while achieving net zero commitments.

The SAF Bill will help secure the future of the aviation sector by boosting green fuel production in the UK and delivering cleaner flights. This bill will give investors the confidence to back sustainable aviation fuel production. It will help grow the sector, providing good green jobs and enabling the delivery of carbon savings.

Announcing the new funding at the University of Sheffield’s Energy Innovation Centre – which just received £1.5 million in this latest round – the Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, saw firsthand the groundbreaking work on aircraft engine testbeds and revolutionary aviation fuels.

Professor Mohamed Pourkashanian, Managing Director of the University of Sheffield’s Energy Innovation Centre, who is leading the project, said:

It is fantastic to see the University of Sheffield playing a leading role in the development of sustainable aviation fuel and supporting the aviation industry in its efforts to reduce its emissions.

At Sheffield, we have some of the most advanced SAF research facilities in Europe and are excited to work with partners from the industry to help them test and develop new fuels and next generation clean energy technologies.

The AFF winners include a range of companies and are spread across the country, such as OXCCU Tech, which is developing a demonstration plant at Oxford Airport, to LanzaJet, which is building a commercial-scale plant in Teesside.

Andrew Symes, CEO and Co-Founder of OXCCU, said:

Support from the Advanced Fuels Fund is a key step in scaling our technology.

This funding enables the detailed design and construction of OX2, our demonstration plant launching in 2026, and builds on the successful delivery of OX1. It brings us closer to producing lower-cost, lower-carbon aviation fuel and supports the UK’s ambition to become a global leader in SAF production.

Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet, said:

We’re proud that Project Speedbird, developed in partnership with British Airways, has been recognised by the Department for Transport as part of its continued commitment to advancing SAF in the UK.

This support demonstrates confidence in LanzaJet’s technology and the critical role ethanol-to-SAF can play in delivering economic growth, creating jobs and decarbonising air travel. Project Speedbird is vital to building a national SAF industry in the UK and to unlocking opportunity and innovation in the region.

We thank DfT for its leadership and vision in accelerating the transition to net-zero aviation.

However, rigid carbon intensity (CI) accounting procedures in current policies may limit CI responsiveness across candidate sites and facilities. This work examines a hypothetical biomass-to-sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) process to demonstrate how GHG accounting requirements drive estimates of biofuel CI and to explore potential CI and financial implications of scenario-specific life cycle assessment (LCA).

The CI of hypothetical SAF produced from miscanthus via the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) pathway was calculated according to specifications from three low carbon fuel policies (U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), Canada Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR), and California Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS)) and the 45Z tax credit. These were compared against modeling results tailored to specific feedstock-to-fuel scenarios (scenario-specific LCA) defined by feedstock and facility siting and feedstock split ratio (the proportion of miscanthus allocated to fuel production vs. electricity).

GHG accounting using the CFR/LCFS can reasonably account for distinct levels of net electricity production by a biorefinery, but only the CFR yields similar CI sensitivity to spatially explicit factors as scenario-specific LCA. Most GHG accounting frameworks do not capture CI variation across candidate sites in the United States.

This work demonstrates the importance of LCA methodological specifications in low carbon fuel policies and tax credits and illustrates that policies that enable scenario-specific CI calculations could enhance crediting accuracy and more effectively support implementation of low-emission practices.
