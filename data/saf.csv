Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) and Swiss cleantech company Synhelion have signed a long-term offtake agreement for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). From 2027, SWISS will purchase at least 200 tons of solar jet fuel from Synhelion annually, pioneering the use of this innovative fuel in civil aviation. The agreement marks an important milestone on the road to more sustainable aviation.

SWISS is the first airline to sign a binding five-year SAF offtake agreement with Synhelion. This marks a pioneering step toward defossilizing aviation. From 2027, Synhelion will produce renewable synthetic crude oil, known as “syncrude”, at its first commercial plant. The syncrude will be processed in an existing refinery together with fossil crude oil and refined into certified Jet-A-1 fuel. Thus, Synhelion directly replaces fossil crude oil with sustainable syncrude, without the need for any adjustments to the existing infrastructure. The fuel will be delivered to the airport via the regular logistics chain and fed into the fuel supply system. Synhelion’s synthetic jet fuel is based on renewable energy and sustainable feedstocks.

A strong signal for sustainable aviation

“The partnership with Synhelion is a significant step for SWISS on the path to decarbonizing our flight operations,” says Jens Fehlinger, CEO of SWISS. “Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are a core element of our sustainability strategy. The offtake agreement with Synhelion sends a strong signal for innovation and responsibility in aviation.”

With this offtake agreement, SWISS is actively supporting the scaling of Synhelion’s technology for the production of renewable synthetic fuels as a customer, investor, and strategic partner. This long-term planning certainty enables targeted expansion of production capacity and helps reduce costs over time.

Pioneering partnership

Synhelion also emphasizes the significance of the agreement: “The fact that SWISS, a leading airline, has committed early on to adopt our fuels demonstrates confidence in the market readiness of our technology,” says Philipp Furler, Co-CEO and Co-Founder of Synhelion. “This partnership is a milestone for the commercial market launch of our fuels – and sets a powerful example to other airlines worldwide.”

Expanding the partnership with Kuehne+Nagel

Part of the renewable jet fuel produced by Synhelion will be resold by SWISS to the logistics service provider Kuehne+Nagel. The company will use the sustainable fuel for air freight transportation with Swiss WorldCargo, offering its customers a tangible solution to reduce their carbon footprint in global logistics.

First delivery already completed

In July 2025, SWISS became the first airline in the world to use solar fuel from Synhelion in regular flight operations. Synhelion delivered its first barrel of syncrude from its DAWN plant to a refinery in northern Germany, where the syncrude was processed into certified jet fuel (Jet-A-1) and subsequently fed into the fuel supply system via Hamburg Airport.

“And this is SAF,” Haas says, holding up another sealed bottle filled with crystal-clear liquid.
“It’s jet fuel – though most people wouldn’t guess it, since it looks just like water.
And a key part of his job is to accelerate SAF adoption at Cathay Pacific.
SAF attributes are the environmental benefits that result from a specified amount of SAF used to replace conventional jet fuel.","“Do you know what this is, or what this might be – the dirty-looking one?” asks Oliver Haas, the head of sustainability – commercial and innovation at Cathay Pacific, holding up a laboratory bottle filled with dark, murky liquid. The bottle contains used cooking oil, Haas explains, which is one of the raw materials most widely used for producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“And this is SAF,” Haas says, holding up another sealed bottle filled with crystal-clear liquid. “It’s jet fuel – though most people wouldn’t guess it, since it looks just like water. But it’s incredibly refined and packed with high-performance chemistry.”

“The magic of SAF is that basically you can turn this into this,” Haas says, holding the two bottles side by side. “You can turn a waste product into jet-grade fuel.”

Having been obsessed – in his words – with aircraft since he was five years old, Haas now sits in an office filled with models of them. And a key part of his job is to accelerate SAF adoption at Cathay Pacific.

In addition to used cooking oil, raw materials used to produce SAF include municipal waste, agricultural residue and even carbon dioxide. The chemical properties of SAF are almost identical to those of conventional jet fuel, and both types can be safely combined for use in aircraft.

“The benefit of SAF is that it is a so-called ‘drop-in fuel’,” Haas says. “Today, it has to be blended by up to 50 per cent with jet fuel, and there are various tests happening in the industry to allow 100 per cent of it to be used. But fundamentally, it can be dropped into an existing aircraft.”

While there are other options for powering an aircraft in a more sustainable way, including hydrogen and electricity, “the big challenge in aviation is that it is very difficult to find alternatives that can compete with jet fuel,” Haas says.

While small electric aircraft are under development, Haas points out they are more suited for regional, short-haul routes in markets such as Europe, the United States and Australia. And though hydrogen can fuel larger aircraft, the challenge lies in producing it cleanly and at a scale that makes it viable.

According to technical analysis conducted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a United Nations agency, SAF has the greatest potential to reduce carbon emissions produced by air travel.

Haas cites a typical flight from Sydney to Hong Kong as an example: “That is a nine-hour flight, which Cathay Pacific currently flies with aircraft that carry more than 300 passengers. There simply aren’t many options to move that many people over that distance in that time, other than by using liquid fuels.”

While SAF is, for now, the most viable option for airlines to reduce their carbon emissions while maintaining current numbers of flights, it also comes with significant challenges, such as high production costs. And SAF supply is still limited – in 2024, it made up just 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade body with 350 member airlines. At these levels, costs will remain high at all points of the SAF supply chain.

Cathay Pacific has launched a new platform that allows passengers to estimate the carbon emissions generated by their flights and make a voluntary contribution to buy SAF attributes. SAF attributes are the environmental benefits that result from a specified amount of SAF used to replace conventional jet fuel.

Each contribution made is used to purchase SAF that is in addition to the airline’s mandated requirement of the percentage of SAF to be mixed into conventional jet fuel. Some countries and trading blocs have now mandated a minimum usage requirement for SAF. The United Kingdom, for instance, has set a SAF usage target of 10 per cent by 2030, while the European Union has set a minimum mandate of 2 per cent this year, to be increased to 70 per cent by 2050.

Eligible members of the Cathay membership programme can earn one Asia Mile for every HK$1 contribution they make to the SAF programme – a special rate offered to passengers to encourage them to take meaningful action and contribute to scaling up the use of SAF.

However, the use of SAF continues to remain a mystery to many people. Haas explains that unlike an electric car, which feels different in the way it sounds, drives and accelerates, SAF is effectively invisible to passengers.

“Even if I put SAF in the aircraft you are sitting in, you don’t have an emotional relationship with that. You can’t touch it. You can’t smell it. You can’t feel it. The whole point of SAF is that it is made to be as close to an equivalent of conventional jet fuel as possible,” he says.

With this in mind, Haas and his team are working on ways to make SAF more relatable to passengers, with most ideas still in their early stages.

No airline can do this alone, and Cathay Pacific’s approach to scaling SAF also includes the Corporate SAF Programme, established in 2022 for its corporate customers. It allows them to purchase SAF attributes with the airline and supports companies in reducing indirect emissions from business trips, while helping the airline to scale SAF usage.

Recently, the airline also announced its participation – as a founding investor – in a new fund, alongside several Oneworld alliance members and Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV), an investment firm founded by Bill Gates that funds climate technology. The Oneworld BEV Fund will address difficulties around the production and cost of SAF, and invest in new technology to that end. Cathay Pacific also announced a joint investment agreement with Airbus, valued at HK$545 million (US$70 million), to drive the development of SAF production globally.

And at its home base, Cathay Pacific has co-initiated the Hong Kong Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition, working with partners to support policy and infrastructure development that will facilitate the use of SAF at Hong Kong International Airport.

However, it is the need to increase general awareness of SAF that Haas says keeps him awake at night and gets him up in the morning.

“Aviation connects people, culture and ideas, and I want to see more of that happen,” he says. “And as individual fliers, we carry a responsibility when we fly. The future of aviation is about continuing to make global travel possible, not just for ourselves, but for others and other generations too.”

In a wide-ranging interview, 4Air founder and CEO Kennedy Ricci discussed why the changing winds in Washington, D.C., are not affecting the business aviation segment’s leadership in reducing emissions.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration announced rollbacks for auto fuel emissions standards.

President Donald J. Trump said at the time, “We’re officially terminating Joe Biden’s ridiculously burdensome, horrible, actually, CAFE standards that impose expensive restrictions.”

Global Industry

However, the global nature of private jet activity means private aviation suppliers from OEMs to MROs and end users are still highly focused on sustainability, Ricci tells Private Jet Card Comparisons.

Ricci notes, “A lot of our industry is international.”

He continues, “Even if you’re based in the U.S. and, if you’re flying overseas, Europe’s obviously a big destination point, (sustainability regulations) matters to you as a U.S. operator.”

Ricci notes, “We’ve seen the rest of the world continue to march ahead.”

Beyond Europe, there are more than a dozen mandates for sustainable aviation fuel.

The United Arab Emirates is the most recent country to introduce a SAF mandate.

Other mandates come from China, Korea, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Turkey, Australia, Brazil, “pretty broadly across the world.”

Even in the U.S., Ricci says, despite the rhetoric in Washington D.C., “what we’ve really seen is things went back to the state level. So we already have a mix of federal and state incentives.”

The net effect for private jet operators, both commercial and private, is that compliance has become more intensive.

“It’s kind of increased the complexity of what you have to look at,” he says.

For example, California’s latest disclosure requirements apply to companies with over $500 million in revenue that do business in the state.

While 4Air launched in 2020, focused on helping source carbon credits, the web of regulations and incentives means “how do we support (customers)…knowing the requirements (and complying).”

Ricci says that failing to take the measures seriously, comply, and report can be costly.

“If you don’t, you get an angry letter at the end of the year that says, ‘Hey, you didn’t comply, and here’s what you owe, plus 100% penalty.'”

4Air also helps identify and obtain incentives to use SAF and reward decarbonization efforts.

Increasing Disclosures

Over the past five years, Ricci says the percentage of large companies disclosing their emissions has increased.

The 2025 State of Corporate Sustainability Disclosure Report, published by the UCLA Anderson Center for Impact, reports a “notable uptick” in emissions and climate risk reporting.

The UCLA Report adds:

‘Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG-emission-disclosure rates remain high at over 88% for S&P 500 companies, while Scope 3 disclosures have improved to 69.5%. Net-zero and carbon-neutrality commitments are becoming increasingly common, with almost 57% of S&P 500 companies having announced such goals. Companies are also beginning to lay important groundwork for climate transition planning: 24.4% of firms have publicly disclosed a transition plan outlining their intended pathways toward decarbonization.’

Ricci says, “A lot of our work of 4Air has actually been building reports for our customers’ customers of what their emissions were? How much did they fly? How much fuel did they consume? What was their carbon impact?”

While 4Air does work directly with UHNWs in some cases, it primarily serves end users through their aircraft management companies, corporate flight departments, and charter and fractional operators.

Private Aviation Sustainability

While anti-private jet groups have called into question the industry’s sustainability initiatives from SAF to carbon credits and eVTOLs as being a mix of greenwashing and pie in the sky, Ricci takes a more measured view.

He points to 4Air’s work identifying and reducing non-carbon emissions, which can have twice the warming effect as carbon emissions.

4Air has been leading several studies about how future flight planning can reduce those contrails.

Those studies will first be proven out using private aviation, he says.

In fact, Ricci notes that business aviation is the incubator for fuel-saving and emissions-reducing technology that is later applied to wider air travel.

Think of those winglets – they were born in private aviation.

Ricci says it will be the same story with both SAF and eVTOLs.

While acknowledging questions about the validity of some carbon offset programs, he sees the criticism as an opportunity to put projects under a microscope and better communicate how and over what period they deliver the desired impact.

Ricci says, “We are taking those higher integrity kind of diligence processes into mind.

We’re very thoughtful about the project types that we’re working with.”

He adds that in the area of future fuel, the industry is investing in everything from new SAF sources to alternatives such as hydrogen.

Ban Private Jets

While aviation, private aviation, and even the broader travel industry are often the target of climate campaigners, Ricci says, “The atmosphere doesn’t care that it came from aviation or that it came from shipping or that it came from forestry. We need to identify reductions and align the types of incentives and willingness to pay with the actual solutions.”

Studies show aviation accounts for about 2% of all global carbon emissions.

Private jets are just 2% of that 2%.

Thinking about groups that are focused on banning private jets, Ricci says, “I’d want to communicate that our desire to decarbonize is genuine.”

Ricci adds, “We want to find good solutions that are meaningful and impactful. We want to make sure we’re thoughtful about the types of programs we’re working on. We want truly sustainable innovations. So the interest we have is genuine.”

To those groups, he says, “If there are ways that you can help us make sure that what we’re doing is actually driving impact, then we’re all for that.”

Next Generation Flyers

What’s more, private jet flight providers will also have to consider the next wave of new customers.

According to recent research among Private Jet Card Comparisons subscribers, 42.3% of respondents who are not flying privately yet but are considering it say sustainability programs will be important in choosing a flight provider.

Partnership advances book and claim models to scale sustainable aviation fuel use beyond physical trade lane constraints

Agreement supports DHL Group’s target to reach 30 percent sustainable aviation fuel use by 2030

DHL Global Forwarding and Air France KLM Martinair Cargo have expanded their partnership with a new framework agreement aimed at accelerating decarbonization across the air freight sector, shifting the focus from transactional fuel purchases to structured, verifiable emission reduction rights.

The agreement builds on a collaboration launched in 2022 and introduces a clearer commercial and governance framework for emission reduction claims. Central to the deal is the development of market ready book and claim models designed to scale sustainable aviation fuel adoption while providing transparency and credibility for corporate climate reporting.

Moving Beyond Transactional SAF Procurement

Under the new framework, DHL Global Forwarding has signed a work order covering 35,000 metric tons of well to wheel CO2e emission reduction rights. The approach reflects a broader shift in how large logistics players are addressing aviation emissions, particularly in a market where physical access to sustainable aviation fuels remains uneven across routes and regions.

Rather than tying emission reductions solely to where fuel is physically uplifted, book and claim mechanisms allow environmental benefits to be allocated independently of specific flights. This structure is increasingly viewed as essential for scaling SAF in the near term, especially for multinational shippers with complex global networks.

“This framework agreement shows what collaborative decarbonization in air freight can look like,” said Henk Venema, Executive Vice President of Global Air Freight at DHL Global Forwarding. “Emission Reduction Rights provide predictability, scalability, and transparency, three critical factors for sustainable aviation fuels to make a real impact within the market. Together with AFKLMP, we are establishing a foundation that can serve as a model for the entire industry.”

A Strategic Carrier Relationship

Air France KLM Martinair Cargo has been one of DHL Global Forwarding’s leading carriers for the past five years and a top performer in DHL’s GoGreen Carrier Evaluation Program. The airline group has also been an active participant in industry initiatives, conferences, and working groups focused on transparency, standard setting, and practical pathways for reducing air freight emissions.

The renewed agreement formalizes a long term collaboration that extends beyond fuel sourcing to include digital verification processes and standardized emissions accounting. For DHL, this strengthens its position as a provider of emission reduced air freight products for customers facing rising regulatory and investor scrutiny of Scope 3 emissions.

“We are proud to renew this partnership with DHL Global Forwarding, a clear sign of leadership,” said GertJan Roelands, SVP Commercial at Air France KLM Martinair Cargo. “Our shared ambition and continued collaboration on SAF are fundamental to scaling the solutions needed to reduce the carbon footprint of the air freight industry. This new agreement reflects mutual trust, operational commitment, and a firm belief that only through close cooperation can we drive meaningful change across the air freight value chain.”

Governance, Reporting, And Scope 3 Pressures

The agreement comes as companies face growing pressure to demonstrate credible progress on indirect emissions, particularly from transportation and logistics. Book and claim systems are gaining attention from regulators, standards bodies, and corporate buyers as a pragmatic interim solution while global SAF supply ramps up.

DHL’s GoGreen Plus products sit at the center of this strategy. The offering enables true value chain decarbonization by replacing fossil fuels with sustainable fuels within DHL’s network and allocating the resulting environmental benefits to customers, even when shipments are not physically moved on low carbon assets.

This allows DHL customers to reduce reported Scope 3 emissions from upstream and downstream transportation and distribution, while supporting voluntary greenhouse gas reporting and progress tracking against decarbonization targets.

Implications For The Global Air Freight Market

The DHL AFKLMP framework agreement aligns with DHL Group’s broader goal to raise sustainable aviation fuel use to 30 percent by 2030. By anchoring SAF deployment in long term contracts and standardized emission reduction rights, the partnership aims to provide the scale and predictability needed to attract further investment into low carbon aviation fuels.

The agreement was formally marked at a ceremony in Amsterdam attended by senior executives from both companies, including Venema and Patrick Bongers, Head of AFR Growth at DHL Global Forwarding.

For the wider air freight industry, the deal reflects a shift toward collaborative, system level solutions that address both physical fuel constraints and the governance challenges of emissions accounting. As regulators and customers demand clearer evidence of climate impact, frameworks that combine operational commitment with credible verification are likely to play a growing role in how aviation decarbonization is financed and delivered globally.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DHL-Air-France-KLM-Cargo-Expand-Emissions-Reduction-Framework-For-Air-Freight.jpeg,N,,2025-12-19 02:58:07.203735

OMB review marks a final stage before a proposed rule is released for public comment.

According to information released by the OMB, the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) includes guidance regarding 45Z implementation, including the calculation of emissions factors for transportation fuel, the determination of clean fuel production credits, and producer registration.

The 45Z tax credit was first established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, providing a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transportation fuels. The original version of the credit started at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit was up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. Under the IRA, the 45Z credit was available for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

The 45Z credit was updated and extended as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed by President Trump in July 2025. Under the OBBBA updates, the “special rate” for SAF will is eliminated beginning in 2026, effectively capping the value of the credit at $1 per gallon for all fuels, including SAF. The OBBBA also extended 45Z for two additional years, through the of 2029. Legislative efforts are currently underway to reinstate the “special rate” for SAF and further extend the credit.

Although the 45Z credit was created in 2023 and entered into force in 2025, Treasury and IRS have failed to release full guidance. Guidance delays have been particularly harmful to the biobased diesel industry, with domestic production down significantly when compared to last year.

Treasury and the IRS in January 2025 issued a notice of intent to propose regulations addressing the clean fuel production credit. A companion notice, also issued in January 2025, included initial guidance on emissions rates under the 45Z credit, including an initial table that sets forth emissions rates for similar categories and types of fuel.

Also in January 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy released the 45ZCF-GREET model, which is designed specifically to evaluate life cycle GHG emissions to meet the requirements of section 45Z.

The DOE in July 2025 issued a notice soliciting public comments on a preliminary plan for determining provisional emissions rates (PER) for the purposes of the 45Z clean fuel production credit. A PER must be determined for any fuel not addressed in the emissions rate tables.

According to information published by the OMB, the upcoming NPRM is expected to address public comments gathered by Treasury and the IRS in response to the January 2025 notices. “These notices were published in early 2025 to meet the statutory deadline of January 1, 2025, however the rules need to be further formalized in an NPRM and then finalized,” according to the OMB’s summary of the NPRM.

One of the things that I think I love the most about Formula One is the sheer amount of innovation and research and development that comes from this space, then find themselves applied in other industries. When we got to our carbon footprint, we realised about 1/3 of it comes from the fact that we are a global business. We fly around the world both things cars, garage equipment and people. Kernels are committed to major investments in sustainable aviation fuel funding 1,000,000 US gallons of sustainable aviation fuel certificates to cover all of its business flight travel. This helped them achieve. The 23% reduction in emissions per race back in 2024 versus 2023. In the US, 12% of transportation emissions is from aviation. And so this gives us a chance to really make an impact in an area that enables us to reach our net zero goal as a world, but also through the work that we're doing together in our respective industries. And on top of that, cutting Rd. freight emissions by 48%. So large scale demands from companies like McLaren absolutely help scale. These markets like the sustainable aviation fuel market, absolutely it's about creating demand signals to create an early market. We need to have partnerships like this that can drive the volume we need to see to really make this really a business valuable endeavor.

The European-backed project is expected to cost between $4B and $6B

A proposal for an industrial plant on Nova Scotia’s Eastern Shore that would produce a low-carbon alternative to traditional jet fuel has passed its first regulatory hurdle, acquiring environmental approval from the province.

In a news release, Nova Sustainable Fuels – a company backed by European energy giant Octopus Energy Generation – called it “one of Eastern Canada’s most ambitious energy projects,” and said the approval is an important step forward.

The plan is to use solar and wind farms as well as biomass to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable methanol. The company describes the products as “two critical low-carbon fuels for decarbonizing the transportation sector.”

Nova Scotia Environment Minister Tim Halman signed off on the project Thursday, with some conditions.

Halman’s conditions include that the project has to get underway within two years (although it can apply for extensions), the company has to submit additional information to support conservation and it has to develop a plan for engaging with the Mi’kmaq.

The approval deals with the first phase of Nova Sustainable Fuels’ plans: a production facility near the mouth of Isaacs Harbour, N.S.

The second phase of Nova Sustainable Fuels’ plan is to build wind and solar farms that would connect to the plant. That will require another environmental assessment, which the company said it plans to submit in 2027.

The facility would require 60 truckloads of biomass – that is, woody byproducts from the forestry industry – per day and 586 cubic metres of fresh water per hour. The plan is to pull the water from two nearby lakes, Meadow Lake and Ocean Lake, through pipelines.

The project will require industrial approval and water withdrawal approval before it can proceed.

The company has estimated the project will cost between $4 billion to $6 billion to launch. It’s expected to take about three years to construct and have a 50-year lifespan.",https://www.cbc.ca/lite/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-18 16:57:34.037726

The company will need a second environmental assessment approval for its second phase – a proposed wind energy and solar farm and a transmission line to supply renewable energy for fuel production.

The company expects the project will create about 1,000 jobs during the construction phase, up to 80 jobs during its operation (expected to end in 2081) and direct and indirect economic benefits for local businesses, communities and residents.

The project must comply with 34 stringent terms and conditions in its environmental assessment approval that are designed to protect the environment and human health. The project will also require an industrial approval and a water withdrawal approval.

Quick Facts:

the company would create a new market for Nova Scotia’s oversupply of biomass from forestry activity, including wood chips and bark that are the byproduct of silviculture, harvesting and sawmilling

the Minister of Environment and Climate Change – the province's environmental regulator – uses the Environment Act and is guided by science and evidence when reviewing environmental assessment requests

if a project is approved, the regulator typically includes terms and conditions which are designed to ensure the environment and people remain protected throughout the life of the project, while also allowing viable, safe and responsible development to take place

the Department's inspection, compliance and enforcement staff ensure companies comply with the terms and conditions of their various approvals; in 2024, they conducted about 6,400 inspections to ensure companies were complying with Nova Scotia’s environmental rules and laws

In China, the price of waste cooking oil, often called “gutter oil”, has risen around fourfold in two years, said Feng Yu, president of aerospace conglomerate Honeywell China.
China’s gutter oil problem first came to prominence in 1998, when Southern Metropolis Daily published a series of reports on the illegal processing of waste grease from sewers and restaurant drains back into cooking oil.
In 2010, reportedly in response to media investigations, regulators issued an emergency notice to block gutter oil from entering the catering sector, noted China News.
After tighter enforcement, waste cooking oil has increasingly been instead redirected into regulated industrial uses such as biodiesel and, more recently, SAF.","The global demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is rapidly driving up feedstock prices. In China, the price of waste cooking oil, often called “gutter oil”, has risen around fourfold in two years, said Feng Yu, president of aerospace conglomerate Honeywell China.

Speaking at a roundtable in Beijing, Feng pointed to the “severe shortage” for this resource worldwide, reported Caixin. Waste oil is a key feedstock for hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), a hydrogenation and refining process that is currently the most commercially mature method of producing SAF.

China’s gutter oil problem first came to prominence in 1998, when Southern Metropolis Daily published a series of reports on the illegal processing of waste grease from sewers and restaurant drains back into cooking oil. In 2010, reportedly in response to media investigations, regulators issued an emergency notice to block gutter oil from entering the catering sector, noted China News. After tighter enforcement, waste cooking oil has increasingly been instead redirected into regulated industrial uses such as biodiesel and, more recently, SAF.

In recent years, SAF has gained strong momentum as a near-term option to reduce aviation emissions, being able to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%. Cost, however, is a problem. SAF trades at two to five times the price of fossil jet fuel in several markets, and according to the International Air Transport Association’s estimates, this price gap could add USD 3.6 billion to airline cost burdens in 2025, noted S&P Global.

Even so, production capacity is growing. Chinese companies that have or are in the process of obtaining airworthiness certification for their SAF have over one million tonnes of production capacity per year, Caixin reported. Additionally, a new facility was inaugurated earlier this month by Honeywell and Jia’ao Environmental Protection that uses proprietary technology to turn about 500,000 tonnes of waste oil into SAF daily, the outlet noted.

Global policies, such as that of the EU, have been a major driver of the SAF push. The bloc has set targets requiring 2% SAF use by 2025 and 70% by 2050. China has no mandatory blending rule, but plans to have consumed 50,000 tonnes of SAF between 2021 and 2025.

Critics remain unconvinced. The co-author of a 2024 report by the Washington-based Institute of Policy Studies called SAF a “huge greenwashing exercise” by the aviation industry, arguing it cannot scale fast enough to replace fossil jet fuel, noted The Guardian. Heavy reliance on bio-based feedstocks could also bring serious risks, including pressure on food supply, damage to natural carbon sinks, and higher pollution from land-use change, the outlet reported.",https://dialogue.earth/content/uploads/2024/04/China-news-digest_THUMBNAIL_Alamy_2EKJEG3.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 11:57:12.699245

This latest contract follows SAMSUNG E&A’s successful acquisition of a KRW 1.4 trillion SAF project in Malaysia late last year, confirming its formal entry into the global SAF market.","SAMSUNG E&A, a comprehensive solutions provider serving the global energy sector, has taken a significant step forward in its clean energy expansion by securing a Front End Engineering Design (FEED) contract for a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production facility in the United States. This achievement represents the company’s full-scale entry into the rapidly growing global clean energy and SAF markets, reinforcing its strategic focus on energy transition technologies.

The company announced on the 15th that it formally signed an agreement on the 12th with DG Fuels, a U.S.-based developer specializing in sustainable aviation fuel projects. Under this agreement, SAMSUNG E&A will carry out the FEED scope for the Louisiana SAF Production Project, a major clean energy initiative planned for the southern United States. The contract covers one of two primary design packages, with SAMSUNG E&A responsible for the clean hydrogen production package. The value of the FEED contract is approximately KRW 23 billion (around USD 15.7 million), and the engineering phase is expected to take roughly 10 months to complete.

Upon successful delivery of the basic engineering work, SAMSUNG E&A plans to pursue a follow-on contract for the project’s main execution phase. The total investment size of the overall project is estimated at nearly USD 3 billion (approximately KRW 4.5 trillion), underscoring the scale and strategic importance of the development. Securing the FEED contract positions SAMSUNG E&A favorably to participate in subsequent engineering, procurement, and construction stages.

The SAF facility will be constructed in St. James Parish, Louisiana, and is designed to produce approximately 600,000 tons of sustainable aviation fuel per year. The plant will utilize regionally abundant waste-based feedstocks, including agricultural residues and woody biomass, supporting both carbon reduction and local resource utilization. This approach aligns with global efforts to decarbonize the aviation sector by replacing conventional fossil-based jet fuel with bio-derived alternatives.

As part of its scope, SAMSUNG E&A will oversee advanced blue hydrogen infrastructure, including facilities such as Air Separation Units (ASU), Auto Thermal Reformers (ATR), and carbon dioxide capture systems. In addition, the company will deliver green hydrogen facilities based on water electrolysis technology, enabling the project to integrate both blue and green hydrogen pathways to support low-carbon fuel production.

This latest contract follows SAMSUNG E&A’s successful acquisition of a KRW 1.4 trillion SAF project in Malaysia late last year, confirming its formal entry into the global SAF market. Sustainable aviation fuel is increasingly viewed as a critical solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in air transport, and global mandates requiring SAF blending are expected to drive consistent market growth in the coming years.

SAMSUNG E&A’s progress is anchored in its future-oriented E&Able strategy, which focuses on securing and deploying key energy transition technologies such as SAF, carbon capture, hydrogen, ammonia, and LNG. Through targeted investments and strategic collaborations, the company has already delivered concrete results, including SAF facilities in Malaysia, a biodegradable plastics plant in the UAE, eco-friendly LNG projects in Indonesia and North America, and a low-carbon ammonia plant in the United States.

Commenting on the achievement, Hong Namkoong, President and CEO of SAMSUNG E&A, stated that the company will strive to secure additional orders by successfully completing the FEED phase. He emphasized that the project will strengthen SAMSUNG E&A’s foothold in North America while expanding its role in next-generation energy transition sectors such as SAF, hydrogen, and carbon capture.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-18 11:57:17.611397

The EU-backed research effort, coordinated by Austria’s Graz University of Technology (TU Graz), reportedly aims to develop a waste-free, climate-neutral biorefinery.
Called ToFuel, the four-year, innovative project aims to convert tomato processing residues into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) while also producing valuable by-products such as fertilizer, animal feed, and nutritional oil.
HEFA is a well-established method for producing sustainable aviation fuel from vegetable, animal, or recycled fats and oils that meets international aviation fuel standards.
“Our clear goal is to produce sustainable aviation fuel based on tomato waste at a competitive sales price,” Kienberger stated in a statement.","Scientists in Europe have launched an initiative to turn residual tomato waste into sustainable jet fuel in a bid to cut carbon emissions and tackle one of aviation’s toughest challenges.

The EU-backed research effort, coordinated by Austria’s Graz University of Technology (TU Graz), reportedly aims to develop a waste-free, climate-neutral biorefinery.

Called ToFuel, the four-year, innovative project aims to convert tomato processing residues into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) while also producing valuable by-products such as fertilizer, animal feed, and nutritional oil.

“According to estimates, around three per cent of the sustainable aviation fuels required in Europe by 2030 could be covered from the amount of tomato pomace produced throughout the EU, i.e., the residues from tomato processing,” Marlene Kienberger, PhD, a professor at TU Graz and project manager, explained.

Powering jets with tomatoes

According to the research team, the approach could support Europe’s efforts to reduce aviation emissions while creating economic value from agricultural waste that is currently discarded or burned.

Meanwhile, tomatoes are the second-most-consumed vegetable in the world, after potatoes. The EU produces around 17 megatons annually, resulting in large volumes of residual biomass.

This includes materials like leaves, stems, peels, seeds, and unripe or spoiled fruit, most of which are considered low-value waste despite being rich in energy-dense compounds that can be converted into fuel.

To achieve this, the researchers are exploring two advanced processing routes. The first uses extrusion, in which the biomass is heated and pressurized before undergoing rapid decompression.

This breaks down plant cell structures and prepares the material for fermentation. Microorganisms then convert it into lipid-rich oils suitable for fuel production.

The second approach uses hydrothermal liquefaction to convert wet biomass into bio-oil and biochar under high temperatures and pressures. The resulting bio-oil is then purified to remove nitrogen-containing compounds that would otherwise interfere with fuel synthesis.

Decarbonizing air travel

The purification and fractionation steps are being developed jointly by scientists from TU Graz, the University of Zagreb in Croatia, and Portugal’s national energy laboratory (LNEG).

The lipids and bio-oil are then converted into a fuel that fulfils the international quality standards for sustainable aviation fuel using the HEFA (Hydrogenated Esters and Fatty Acids) process at the Technical University of Leoben in Austria.

HEFA is a well-established method for producing sustainable aviation fuel from vegetable, animal, or recycled fats and oils that meets international aviation fuel standards.

“Our clear goal is to produce sustainable aviation fuel based on tomato waste at a competitive sales price,” Kienberger stated in a statement. “Ultimately, sustainable aviation fuels simply have to be economically viable.

During the project, the two technologies will be scaled up toward pre-industrial demonstration as researchers evaluate their environmental, economic, and social impacts. The utilization of tomato residues also creates new sources of income for food processing companies.

Officially launching on January 1, 2026, the ToFuel project will bring together 11 partners from seven European countries. It will operate with a budget of USD 4.1 million (EUR 3.5 million).",https://cms.interestingengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/A1_bf9fd9.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 11:57:28.030706

This year, we're counting them down from Dec. 18 to Dec. 31. On Jan. 1 and Jan. 2, we will look at some of the runners-up for this year. Today, we begin the countdown with No. 10: How biofuels court cases and government policies drove continued change in the market for biofuels.

**

LINCOLN, Neb. (DTN) -- From a Supreme Court ruling in favor of biofuels groups, to a new Renewable Fuel Standard volumes proposal and more debate on small-refinery exemptions, biofuels news this year was highly consequential and starts our Top 10 Ag Stories of 2025 countdown.

As President Donald Trump took office for a second term, the year started with the U.S. Supreme Court hearing oral arguments from biofuels and petroleum industry groups on the proper court to hear court challenges to small-refinery exemptions to the RFS. (https://www.dtnpf.com/…)

The Supreme Court ruled later in the year that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was indeed the proper venue. It was considered a win for biofuels because it is expected to bring consistency to future cases.

Unlike the first go-round with the Trump administration that saw the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant numerous SREs without considering how it affected the RFS, the second Trump administration decided to take a different approach.

The administration released proposed RFS volumes for 2026 and 2027 that gave a significant boost to renewable diesel volumes. (https://www.dtnpf.com/…) That proposal sparked a jump in the soybean futures price.

In August 2025, the Trump administration granted full exemptions on 63 small-refinery exemption petitions, partial exemptions for 77 and denied 28 others. (https://www.dtnpf.com/…)

The following month, the EPA proposed several options to reallocate biofuels gallons lost through SREs to other obligated parties including petroleum companies, also announcing the RFS volumes proposal could be further delayed because of the SRE issue. (https://www.dtnpf.com/…)

The first Trump administration took a lot of heat for granting more than 80 SREs without trying to reallocate biofuels gallons lost -- by some estimates at 4 billion gallons.

Also in September, the California Senate voted unanimously on a bill to sell E15 in the state for the first time. The legislation was later signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The move opened a 600- to 800-million-gallon market for ethanol. (https://www.dtnpf.com/…)

E15 in California was welcomed news in a year that passed without federal lawmakers addressing national E15 legislatively.

Despite repeated calls from biofuels groups, the Trump administration did not provide additional tax guidance on the 45Z Clean Fuels Production tax credit as companies continued to wait for certainty on their investments in sustainable aviation fuel. (https://www.dtnpf.com/…)

Even with a lack of 45Z certainty, companies like Summit Carbon Solutions continued to move on to next steps in building a carbon pipeline to connect to nearly 50 ethanol plants across the Midwest.

Summit not only announced that it hired Joe Griffin as a new chief executive officer, but Griffin then launched a campaign to improve relationships with landowners along the future path of the pipeline. The pipeline is considered an important avenue to help ethanol companies lower their carbon footprint enough for ethanol to be considered a good feedstock for SAF production.

Indirect benefits include the procurement of local raw materials, the involvement of Egyptian construction firms, and the creation of thousands of direct jobs for Egyptian workers.

“The land for the Al Mana Holding project… is granted to the company under the usufruct system, as is customary with the authority’s other investment contracts, without ceding any part of it,” the SCZone stated.

The authority also clarified that tax and customs exemptions granted to the project are standard investment incentives provided under the SCZone law for special economic zones, rather than specific concessions for a single investor.

Regarding the project’s commercial viability, the statement noted that Al Mana had secured an agreement with Shell to supply its entire production output prior to signing the contract with the SCZone. This arrangement was based on extensive financial studies to ensure marketing and return on investment.

The SCZone highlighted that Sokhna was selected due to the integration between the industrial zone and the port—recently recognised by Guinness World Records as the world’s deepest man-made port basin.

Located in the Ain Sokhna Integrated Zone, the project will be built on a 100,000-sq-metre site, apart from having an annual production capacity of 200,000 tonnes, according to a post on the official account of the Egyptian Cabinet Presidency.

The facility will produce SAF and related by-products, including bio-propane and bio-naphtha, using refined used cooking oil. Al Mana Holding has also secured a long-term supply agreement with global energy giant Shell for the project’s full output, with deliveries of sustainable aviation fuel expected to begin by the end of 2027.

The project aligns with Egypt’s national plans to support the North African country’s aviation sector in line with environmental sustainability standards, amid strong global growth expectations for cleaner aviation fuels.

“This project is a new addition that enhances the capabilities of the economic zone in keeping pace with the global trend toward relying on renewable energy sources, especially in supporting the promising aviation sector,” Egypt’s Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said during the signing ceremony.

He added that the signing of the contract, which coincided with the “Egyptian-Qatari Business Forum” in Cairo, reflected recent improvements in bilateral relations and the desire of both countries’ leaderships to translate political cooperation into increased investment and trade.

Waleid Gamal El-Dein, Chairman of the SCZONE, said environmental sustainability is a core pillar of the zone’s strategy.

He added, “The project will lead to a reduction in harmful emissions by rates ranging between 50% to 80% compared to conventional fuel.”

According to El-Dein, securing a long-term offtake agreement with Shell would help boost exports from projects within the SCZONE, apart from supporting Egypt’s broader plans to increase exports and reduce imports.

“The total number of companies established in the SCZONE has reached 457, including 296 formed since the start of the 2022/2023 fiscal year, with total issued capital of USD 785 million from investors across multiple countries,” he noted.",https://globalbusinessoutlook.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/global-business-outlook-logo-m.png,N,,2025-12-18 12:57:22.745053

Neste deploys global SAF production and airport fuel system access to enable immediate emissions reductions without aircraft or infrastructure changes

Agreement highlights how airlines are using long-term SAF supply partnerships to manage decarbonization risk amid tightening global aviation climate policy

A multi-region SAF rollout for a global airline network

Cathay Group has entered into an agreement with Neste to supply sustainable aviation fuel across three of the world’s most strategically important aviation markets, marking a step change in how large international carriers are scaling SAF use beyond single-airport pilots.

Under the agreement, Neste supplies Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel™ for Cathay Group’s aviation operations in Europe, the United States, and Asia-Pacific. The fuel is already being delivered in blended form into airport fuel systems, allowing it to be used directly on scheduled flights without operational disruption.

In Europe, blended SAF is being supplied for Cathay Pacific flights departing from Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. In the United States, Neste has been delivering SAF for Cathay Pacific operations at Los Angeles International Airport. In Asia-Pacific, the fuel is supplied into Singapore Changi Airport’s fuel facilities for flights operated by Air Hong Kong, the Cathay Group-owned all-cargo airline.

By convincing multiple airports and fuel systems to support SAF blending for its operations, Cathay is moving beyond symbolic adoption and into repeatable, scalable use across its long-haul network.

Why SAF remains the airline industry’s primary lever

For aviation, where near-term electrification remains unviable for long-haul routes, SAF is widely viewed as the most practical solution available today for cutting lifecycle emissions. Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel™ can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 percent over the fuel’s life cycle compared with conventional fossil-based jet fuel.

Neste’s SAF is produced from renewable waste and residue raw materials, including used cooking oil and animal fat waste. It is certified for commercial use and can be blended up to 50 percent with conventional jet fuel. Crucially for airlines under cost and operational pressure, it works with existing aircraft engines and fueling infrastructure.

This compatibility allows airlines to decarbonize incrementally while avoiding capital-intensive fleet or infrastructure overhauls, a key consideration as regulatory pressure rises in Europe, North America, and parts of Asia.

Corporate commitments meet fuel supply reality

For Cathay Group, the agreement reflects a strategy focused on embedding SAF into daily operations rather than relying on limited-volume showcase flights.

“Partnering with Neste marks a significant step toward our shared vision of decarbonizing air travel. This collaboration is among our multifaceted strategy in accelerating the adoption of SAF within our extensive network, which reinforces our commitment to innovation and sustainability, ensuring we deliver meaningful impact for our customers and the air transport industry. SAF continues to play an important role in our decarbonization journey as the most viable solution today for addressing emissions associated with flying,” said Kristof Van Passel, Head of Procurement Operations & Sustainability at Cathay Pacific.

From Neste’s perspective, the agreement demonstrates how global SAF production capacity can be translated into real-world airline usage across continents.

“Neste is proud to support Cathay Group in its journey to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by supplying Neste MY SAF. Our global SAF production and supply capabilities offer international airlines, such as Cathay, a viable option to scale up usage of SAF, which is a key lever to reduce aviation related emissions. At the same time it enables Cathay’s customers to reduce the GHG emissions of their air travel and transport activities,” said Mario Mifsud, Vice President Renewable Fuels Sales & Trading EMEA & APAC at Neste.

Supply scale and policy alignment

Neste’s global SAF production capacity currently stands at 1.5 million tons per annum and is expected to increase to 2.2 million tons by 2027. That scale is becoming increasingly relevant as governments introduce blending mandates and emissions reporting requirements for aviation fuel.

In Europe, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation sets binding SAF blending targets for airlines operating in the region. Similar policy discussions are underway in the US and Asia-Pacific, creating both compliance risk and strategic opportunity for carriers able to secure reliable SAF supply early.

For investors and airline executives, the Cathay-Neste agreement illustrates how fuel procurement is becoming a core climate governance issue. Long-term SAF access is no longer a branding exercise but a hedge against regulatory tightening, carbon pricing exposure, and future fuel scarcity.

As aviation faces intensifying scrutiny over its climate footprint, multi-region SAF supply agreements like this one are emerging as a defining feature of credible airline decarbonization strategies.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Neste-Supplies-SAF-To-Cathay-Group-Across-Europe-US-And-Asia-Pacific.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 14:57:50.627904

”We are deeply proud that the sustainability initiatives of the World Athletics Championships Tokyo 2025 have been highly recognised by World Athletics, achieving the highest platinum level under the Athletics for a Better World Standard,” said Mitsugi Ogata, President of the WCH Tokyo 25 local organising committee.
All cars, compact shuttles and motorcycles from the official vehicle fleet provided by World Athletics Partner Honda were either electric, hybrid or fuel cell (green-powered hydrogen) powered, another first for a World Athletics Championships.
A mandatory minimum achievement against the ABW Standard will be a contractual requirement for most World Athletics Series events from 2026.","The World Athletics Championships Tokyo 25 earned platinum level recognition against the Athletics for a Better World (ABW) Standard, the tiered evaluation system implemented by World Athletics that measures an event’s achievements in sustainable delivery.

The recognition came after a comprehensive evaluation by a team of international sustainability experts of the local organising committee’s efforts to reduce the event’s environmental impacts and maximise their social and local economic benefits.

The WCH Tokyo 25 was only the third event to achieve the top level of the evaluation system since it was implemented in 2024, and the first edition of a World Athletics Championships to do so.

“From the outset, the local organising committee made reducing the environmental impact of these championships and maximising their social impact a top priority,” World Athletics President Sebastian Coe said. “They did so by having a strong vision and clear objective to create a sustainability template that all sporting events, not just athletics, can follow. The Tokyo team has set a high bar for future World Championships.""

The local organising committee of the WCH Tokyo 25 were the first outdoor World Athletics Championships host to fully adopt the ABW Standard and its 55 action areas. The WCH Tokyo 25 sustainability plan, created in alignment with the standard, charted a path towards platinum level certification, and with it, the creation of what organisers have dubbed ‘The Tokyo Model’, a new global benchmark for delivering an environmentally and socially responsible international sports event.

”We are deeply proud that the sustainability initiatives of the World Athletics Championships Tokyo 2025 have been highly recognised by World Athletics, achieving the highest platinum level under the Athletics for a Better World Standard,” said Mitsugi Ogata, President of the WCH Tokyo 25 local organising committee. “This achievement is the result of close collaboration among the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, the Japan Association of Athletics Federations, sponsors, and all those who contributed to delivering a sustainable event.”

A focus on renewable energy sources and biofuels

Biofuels powered 100% of the temporary generators used to provide power for broadcasters, a first for a World Athletics Championships. Additionally, all electricity purchased for the championships was either supplied from renewable energy sources or guaranteed through certified energy certificates.

All cars, compact shuttles and motorcycles from the official vehicle fleet provided by World Athletics Partner Honda were either electric, hybrid or fuel cell (green-powered hydrogen) powered, another first for a World Athletics Championships. Biofuels also powered the temporary power generators at the training venues and some of the transportation fleet used to transport athletes. That too was a first.

Almost all of the spectators used public transportation to reach the National Stadium, further reducing the event’s carbon footprint.

Innovation on show, sharing sustainability stories

Organisers used the event to showcase locally-developed sustainable innovation, initiatives that also contributed to the championships’ sustainability legacy.

The hub of that activity was the LOC tent in the Stadium park, which featured displays explaining and sharing the event’s sustainability programme. Nearly 20,000 spectators visited the tent over the course of the championships.

The area was used to demonstrate practical applications of Next-Generation Solar Cells, a solar power technology developed in Japan. The cells are 20 times thinner than regular solar panels and can be plastered over stadiums, airports and office buildings, enabling mass adoption to solar power across large parts of the country. Lights, powered by the cells, were installed along the spectator route from the train station to the stadium and remained in place after the championships.

Another popular draw were the sustainability quizzes and giveaways hosted by athletes and athletics legends. More than 1000 spectators attended those seven activations.

Organisers communicated their sustainability initiatives widely through campaigns targeting specific themes and through a looped video shown on dozens of screens throughout the stadium.

Sustainable aviation fuel awareness and supply chain campaign

In alignment with its ‘Zero Emissions Tokyo by 2050’ targets, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government launched a used cooking oil collection project in 2023 that encourages businesses and communities to help build a supply chain for domestically produced Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a type of biofuel usually made from food and feed crops, waste oils and fats. When more widely implemented, use of SAF can ultimately reduce the carbon emissions of aviation fuel by up to 80% over its lifecycle.

The mascot RikuOne and Haruka Kitaguchi, the 2023 world javelin champion, helped promote the campaign.

Local sourcing and waste reduction

A dedicated sustainable procurement policy was developed, with World Athletics guidance, to inform all sourcing decisions, prioritising environmentally responsible products when available. Some highlights:

• 450,000 single-used plastic bottles, more than 10 tonnes, were recycled through a circular ‘Bottle to Bottle’ recycling system, developed in cooperation with event sponsor Otsuka Pharmaceuticals

• 81% of the products used at the event were sourced within 100km

• All catered meals at VIP areas and in the team hotels featured vegan and vegetarian options, focusing on locally and regionally-sourced food

• Food loss was reduced through the rigorous assessment and optimisation of the number of meals provided, as well as through measures such as the composting of discarded food materials

The policy also included reuse and repurposing initiatives that engaged with various community and regional groups.

Other initiatives included a plogging event organised by event sponsor Morinaga, several Kids Athletics activations in the build-up to the event, training and announcements related to sustainability for the LOC staff and volunteers and cultural sensitivity training for the event's 3000 volunteers, and athletics participation programmes that reached thousands of local elementary school students.

A comprehensive sustainability report, providing insight and analysis of the LOC's sustainability impact, will be published soon.

Ogata added: ""The strong message of integrating sports and sustainability conveyed during this championship will remain a significant legacy of the event. Initiatives such as SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), next-generation solar cells ‘Air Solar’, the use of biofuels and low-emission vehicles, as well as bottle-to-bottle recycling and plogging, are believed to serve as a model for future sporting events. Encouraged by this recognition, we are committed to carrying this legacy forward into the future.”

About the Athletics for a Better World Standard

The centenary year is not a time for looking back but for pushing forward with its net zero targets. The airline has made progress on electrifying its ground operations, improved fuel efficiency and reduced waste across its operations.

The Atlanta-based carrier surpassed its near-term fuel savings goal, delivering more than 55 million gallons of jet fuel savings from operational improvements in the first quarter alone. This achievement not only saves Delta more than US$125m but also advances its pursuit of net zero emissions.

A key part of this success comes from Delta's cross-enterprise Carbon Council, which implements measures including on-board weight reduction, optimised aircraft speed and new landing procedures.

Compared to current regional aircraft designs, Maeve's aircraft aims to cut fuel consumption and emissions by up to 40% using conventional jet fuel. Further lifecycle emissions reductions could be possible when using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“As we work toward the next generation of aircraft, we look to partners like Maeve who embody the forward-thinking innovation we champion at Delta – solutions that advance aircraft design, enhance operational efficiency, elevate employee and customer experiences and cut emissions,” says Kristen Bojko, Vice President of Fleet at Delta Air Lines.

Earlier in the year, Delta also partnered with aerospace startup JetZero. The airline is providing operational expertise through its Sustainable Skies Lab to support the development of a blended wing-body (BWB) aircraft.

This futuristic-looking plane is expected to be up to 50% more fuel efficient than the average aircraft in operation today.

Innovative technology and efficiency gains

Delta's focus on innovation extends beyond new aircraft models. Delta renews its collaboration with Airbus to test fello'fly, a flying technique inspired by migrating geese. By pairing flights so one aircraft can benefit from the uplift created by another, the practice could reduce fuel consumption by 5% on long-haul flights, according to Airbus.

The airline also added MicroTau, an Australian aerospace technology company, to its Sustainable Skies Lab. MicroTau creates an external cladding for planes that mimics shark skin to reduce drag and save fuel. The startup estimates the technology, which can be applied to a plane’s fuselage, wings and tail, may improve fuel efficiency by up to 4%.

Further initiatives include the testing of finlets on the rear fuselage to reshape airflow and reduce drag. Delta also finalised the modification of the split-scimitar winglet upgrade on its 737-800 fleet this year, marking the completion of adding advanced winglet technology to all existing fleets that can be modified.

Scaling SAF and electrifying ground operations

While new aircraft and technologies mature, Delta continued to focus on measures within its immediate control. The airline says it is on track to increase its usage of SAF by 50% compared to last year.

In 2025, a collaboration with Shell Aviation, Montana Renewables and the Port of Portland saw the first-ever commercial-scale delivery of SAF to Portland International Airport. According to Airbus, SAF can reduce an airline’s emissions by up to 80%.

On the ground, Delta partnered with Green Taxi Aerospace to explore electric taxiing technology. This innovation aims to reduce fuel use, operating costs, taxi time and carbon emissions during the ground phase of flight operations.

The year also saw the airline replace plastic cups with paper alternatives across its entire operation and open new facilities at Seattle-Tacoma International with sustainability in mind, featuring smart windows and all-electric energy with motion-sensing lights.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/535c1631ecc9f90b593e8eede5b4306b:36f6d59fbd9edb96884780e4d467d2bc/gettyimages-1294131568.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 09:58:56.264730

The list includes Miami, New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston, and yet to be named destinations in the Bay Area, with Napa Valley and the Caribbean also being considered for seasonal services.

As is the case of other premium-only operators, Magnifica Air’s fleet will also be available for VIP charters and curated experiential trips, catering, for example, to air cruise operators.

When it comes to the passenger experience, Magnifica Air has named its inflight product “Private Class” and, in tune with the sense of exclusivity it aims to project, it is also planning to launch a private membership community called “The Seven Club”. Its members will get priority access, fixed-rate pricing, and exclusive invitations to curated experiences and cultural and sports events such as Art Basel or The Masters.

Since Magnifica Air aims to fill the market gap between private jet travel and the first class product offered by commercial airlines it is also focused on delivering an executive experience on the ground.

Passengers will be able to arrive at the airport up to 30 minutes before departure and use private terminals with white-glove baggage handling and dedicated TSA-approved screening. Upon arrival at their destination, passengers will have their baggage delivered within 10–15 minutes and chauffeur-driven to their final destination.

Magnifica Air has also shared details of its sustainability program. The carrier plans to uplift some seven million gallons of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) annually, will run an emissions offset program and its lounges will be solar powered. The startup carrier has also noted that among its backers is CIG Companies, which runs a $150 million renewable energy fund.",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/12/Magnifica-Air-.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 14:57:55.896197

(NYSE:JOBY), a company developing electric air taxis for commercial passenger service, today announced its support for the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) National Strategy, as well as its intent to immediately engage on key recommendations. The Strategy provides a clear policy roadmap for AAM deployment and integration across workforce, infrastructure, safety and data sharing.

“This strategy is tangible proof that the U.S. government recognizes the value of the AAM industry, and it comes as we’re preparing for early air taxi operations in U.S. cities through the eIPP program, created by an Executive Order this summer. It’s a powerful signal that our federal government, in coordination with state, local and tribal communities, is prepared to usher in the next generation of U.S. leadership in aviation,” said JoeBen Bevirt, founder and CEO of Joby.

Congress passed the “Advanced Air Mobility and Coordination Act” in 2022 to ensure federal agencies work in coordination on investments necessary for the maturation of the AAM ecosystem in the United States. The DOT, under Secretary Duffy’s leadership, subsequently brought together at least 19 federal agencies and departments to develop and publish this Strategy. The Strategy fosters innovation, ensures safety, and promotes cohesion across the federal government to shape the future of air transportation in the United States.

It also comes as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and DOT look to execute the Electric Vertical Take Off and Landing (eVTOL) Integration Pilot Program (eIPP) starting in 2026. eIPP supports eVTOL use cases across the country ahead of FAA Type Certification, such as proving routes for operations. The eIPP’s near-term operations and the Strategy’s policy recommendations empower regulators, communities and industry alike to move forward in lockstep.

Joby’s advanced progress towards certification and operational maturity uniquely positions the company to immediately engage on the Strategy’s core recommendations:

Leverage Existing or Repurposed Infrastructure: Joby’s operational strategy has always focused on using a blend of existing and new infrastructure to deploy its air taxi services. The Strategy’s emphasis on facilitating the use of “existing or repurposed infrastructure for near- and medium-term AAM operations” directly aligns with Joby’s plan to initiate commercial services without requiring significant upfront investment in infrastructure.

Data Sharing with Respective Government Agencies: Joby has led the industry’s regulatory path, becoming the first eVTOL company to finalize its certification blueprint (G-1) with the FAA, and is now entering the final stages of validating all necessary design, flight and manufacturing data. Combined with flying over 50,000 miles - including 850 flights in 2025 and operating test flights within the National Airspace System - means Joby has a significant amount of data needed for the Strategy.

Building the Workforce: Careers in aviation unlock opportunities for economic mobility and Joby has been actively engaged in building a skilled AAM workforce here in the United States. The company employs more than 2,000 people globally, including through Joby’s apprenticeship program. Joby’s manufacturing workforce continues to grow at the company’s scaled production site in Dayton, Ohio and its pilot production line in Marina, California. Through its aviation academy, the company is also building a talent pipeline of pilots and aircraft mechanics. The Strategy’s focus on developing workforce pipelines, including leveraging military experience, supports Joby’s integrated manufacturing and operating strategy, as well as its development of dual-use technologies for U.S. defense.

Autonomy & Safety: The commitment to developing an aviation autonomy roadmap aligns with work already underway at Joby. Joby’s Superpilot™ autonomous flight technology, validated over thousands of flight miles, provides critical operational data to advance the Strategy’s goals for increasingly autonomous and scaled operations. In addition, Joby has participated in two simulations with the FAA and NASA to validate integration of eVTOL operations using existing air traffic control procedures into the National Airspace System around Los Angeles International Airport, Dallas Love Field and DFW airports.

The Administration’s roadmap comes at a moment of unprecedented validation for Joby. In 2025, Joby’s flight test program spanned three countries, including operations at the World Expo in Osaka, Japan, extreme-environment testing in the United Arab Emirates, and public airport-to-airport missions in California. With its aircraft now advancing into the final stage of FAA certification, and pre-certification demonstration programs launching next year, 2026 is set to be an inflection point.",https://www.asdnews.com/NewsImages/b/95206/103141_O.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 10:57:23.299837

The analysis also underscores Latin America, where abundant biomass resources, consolidated agro-industrial systems, and emerging SAF research initiatives create favorable conditions for future development and deployment.

1. Introduction

Air transport plays a fundamental role in the global economy by facilitating connectivity between regions, international trade, and tourism. However, its exponential growth has raised increasing concerns about its environmental impact, particularly due to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and other compounds that contribute to climate change [1]. Aviation is responsible for approximately 2–3% of global CO2 emissions, but its impact on global warming is greater due to the release of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and the formation of contrails, which amplify radiative forcing [2,3]. In this context, the transition to Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) has emerged as one of the most promising strategies to reduce the sector’s carbon footprint [4].

Recent assessments by the International Energy Agency (IEA) provide more detailed insight into aviation’s climate impact. In short-haul flights, aircraft emit approximately 0.25 kg of CO2 per passenger-kilometer, while long-haul flights emit around 0.20 kg due to improved operational efficiency over longer distances [5]. Beyond CO2, high-altitude emissions of NOx, water vapor, and particulate matter enhance radiative forcing, significantly increasing the warming effect associated with aviation activities [3].

When compared to other modes of transport, aviation remains considerably more carbon intensive. Private vehicles typically generate 0.12 to 0.20 kg of CO2 per passenger-kilometer, while buses emit between 0.05 and 0.10 kg. Maritime transport, which moves a large portion of global freight, exhibits much lower emissions per tonne-kilometer, generally ranging from 0.03 to 0.04 kg of CO2 [6]. These differences highlight the disproportionate climate impact of aviation and have intensified concerns regarding the decarbonization of the sector in the context of global climate commitments such as the Paris Agreement [2,7].

SAF includes various technologies and feedstocks, ranging from second and third-generation biofuels to synthetic fuels produced through carbon capture and water electrolysis. Despite significant advances in research and development, large-scale adoption of these fuels faces technical, economic, and regulatory challenges [8]. SAF production continues to be more expensive than conventional fossil fuels, and availability is limited by infrastructure constraints and the absence of a unified international regulatory framework [9].

To be used in commercial aviation, biofuels must comply with strict quality and safety standards established by international organizations. The primary certification for SAF is ASTM D7566, developed by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), which defines specification requirements and certification processes before SAF can be blended with conventional Jet A or Jet A-1 fuel. This standard ensures chemical equivalence with current aviation fuels and enables their use without modifications to aircraft engines or fuel handling systems. In addition, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) [10,11] and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) [12] have established guidelines to ensure the sustainability and verified carbon reduction in SAF throughout their life cycle.

Although research on SAF has expanded in recent years, much of the existing literature remains distributed among studies that analyze isolated topics such as specific conversion pathways, environmental assessments, or policy frameworks [13,14]. This dispersion highlights the value of consolidating these elements from a chemical engineering perspective. At the same time, growing interest in low-carbon fuels across Latin America, combined with the region’s abundant biomass resources and established agro-industrial infrastructure, presents a strategic opportunity for the expansion of SAF production. Recent initiatives, such as Ecopetrol’s efforts to produce SAF at the Cartagena Refinery using recycled oils, including used cooking oil and palm-oil-derived feedstocks supplied by Ecodiesel and other Colombian small and medium-sized enterprises [15], demonstrate the region’s potential to position Latin America as an emerging contributor to the global SAF landscape.

Latin America also offers a significant advantage due to its extensive biomass availability, agricultural capacity, and expanding research activity. Regional assessments indicate that Latin America could sustainably generate approximately 19.9 EJ (exajoules) of biomass annually, a quantity that corresponds to more than 3 billion barrels of oil in energy terms [16,17]. This potential aligns with global research trends that show increasing regional participation in SAF-related studies, especially in countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, where interest in alternative aviation fuels has grown alongside broader sustainability objectives.

In addition to resource potential, the region has implemented concrete initiatives that demonstrate early industrial readiness. Brazil has advanced research and pilot-scale projects involving technologies such as ATJ and Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) using sugarcane ethanol, soybean oil, and other agro-industrial residues [18]. Paraguay’s Omega Green project, which is the first commercial-scale SAF and hydrotreated vegetable oil plant in South America, illustrates the feasibility of exporting sustainable fuels derived from regional feedstocks [19]. Colombia has also completed successful test flights with SAF blends and is exploring the development of a dedicated production facility supported by private-sector interest in expanding HEFA-SPK capacity [20]. These initiatives underscore Latin America’s emerging role in the global transition toward SAF and reveal opportunities to leverage regional feedstocks, infrastructure, and public–private collaboration.

Therefore, this study aims to analyze SAF production technologies through a bibliometric approach, consolidating scattered information and identifying trends, technological developments, and existing challenges from a chemical engineering perspective. The analysis highlights the most promising conversion routes, evaluates their technical feasibility, and examines factors influencing their adoption at a global level. It also considers regional opportunities, with particular emphasis on Latin America’s emerging role in SAF production. Ultimately, the findings may support the development of strategies to optimize SAF production and facilitate their integration into the aviation sector, contributing to a more sustainable air transport model.

2. Materials and Methods

As mentioned, the bibliometric analysis revealed five distinct thematic clusters that represent key research areas within the field of SAF. These clusters highlight the diverse approaches explored by researchers, ranging from first-generation biofuels to advanced conversion technologies. Each cluster is characterized by specific keywords that indicate the predominant research focus in that area. The following sections provide a detailed overview of each cluster, outlining the main topics and trends observed in the scientific literature.

3.2. Classification of Technologies for Sustainable Aviation Fuels

Table 1 provides a structured classification of SAF technologies based on their production method, feedstock, development stage, application in aviation, life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, and emission reduction relative to Jet A1. Conventional Jet A1 fuel, derived from fossil-based crude oil, is included as a reference point with life cycle emissions of 89 g CO2eq/MJ [22]. In contrast, alternative SAF technologies exhibit significantly lower emissions and varied levels of technological maturity.

Fischer–Tropsch (FT) and FT-SPK pathways are classified as commercial technologies, reflecting their established deployment and integration into current fuel supply chains. HEFA also appears as a fully commercial route, supported by its compatibility with existing infrastructure and a consistent supply of lipid-based feedstocks [23,24]. The ATJ and Catalytic Hydrothermolysis Jet (CHJ) processes are at commercial or pilot/commercial stages, indicating active efforts in scale-up and early market penetration, particularly with biomass-derived ethanol and used cooking oil as feedstocks.

In contrast, technologies such as Dimethylcyclooctane (DMCO), Power-to-Liquid (PtL), and Direct Air Capture (DAC)-based routes remain at the pilot or research/demonstration stages. These pathways, while showing high emission reduction potential (up to ~90%), face current limitations related to feedstock processing, CO2 capture, renewable hydrogen supply, and economic feasibility. SAF from microalgae is likewise in early development due to ongoing challenges in biomass productivity and conversion efficiency [14,25].

Overall, Table 1 highlights the diversity of SAF production pathways not only in terms of feedstock and conversion technologies but also in their environmental performance and technological readiness. This comparative view underscores the coexistence of mature, commercially viable options alongside emerging routes with high potential but requiring further research, demonstration, and policy support to reach large-scale implementation.

3.3. Opportunities and Challenges in Biofuel Technologies

Lau et al. (2024) reported that the assessment of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) is a valuable tool to classify the maturity of each technological pathway for SAF production [26]. TRL is a standardized scale ranging from 1 to 9, where TRL 1 refers to the observation of basic principles, and TRL 9 corresponds to a technology that has been proven in an operational environment. Among the reviewed technologies shown in Table 2, HEFA stands out with a TRL of 9, indicating full commercial maturity and certification by ASTM International, under standards such as ASTM D7566. FT-SPK fuels are also highly mature (TRL 6–8), with ongoing commercial use [26].

In contrast, technologies like CHJ (TRL 4–6), DMCO (TRL ~4), and microalgae-derived SAF (TRL 3–4) remain in early development stages, with limited demonstration and significant technical barriers [22]. The ATJ pathway (TRL 7–8) is approaching full deployment but still faces scale-up limitations. Finally, emerging concepts such as PtL and DAC integrated into SAF processes are estimated to range between TRL 4 and 6, depending on the specific configuration [27]. This classification provides a clear understanding of both current technological progress and the remaining challenges to achieve widespread implementation of SAF technologies.

The ASTM D7566 [28] standard is the primary international specification that governs the quality requirements for aviation turbine fuels containing synthesized hydrocarbons. These include several types of SAF produced through alternative pathways. The standard outlines the performance and compositional criteria that SAF must meet to ensure compatibility with existing aircraft engines and fuel systems.

Each approved SAF production pathway is included as a separate annex within ASTM D7566. For example, Annex A1 covers FT-SPK, Annex A2 covers HEFA-SPK, Annex A5 covers Alcohol-to-Jet Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (ATJ-SPK), and Annex A6 covers CHJ. These annexes provide detailed technical specifications for the respective fuels, including blending limits, compositional requirements, and performance parameters.

Once a SAF is blended within the limits defined by ASTM D7566 and meets all required specifications, it can be reclassified as conventional jet fuel under ASTM D1655, the standard specification for Jet A and Jet A-1 fuels. This reclassification allows SAF to be used interchangeably with fossil-based jet fuel in commercial aviation without requiring modifications to aircraft engines or infrastructure.

This ability to reclassify SAF as conventional jet fuel under ASTM D1655 highlights one of the key attributes of certain SAF technologies: their drop-in nature. A drop-in fuel is defined as a synthetic or bio-based fuel that is chemically and physically compatible with petroleum-derived jet fuels, allowing it to be used in existing aircraft engines and fuel infrastructure without any technical modifications. Drop-in SAF can be blended with fossil-based Jet A or Jet A-1 fuels up to specific limits (typically 10% to 50%, depending on the certified pathway), while maintaining compliance with operational and safety standards. This compatibility significantly reduces logistical and regulatory barriers to SAF adoption, enabling gradual integration into the aviation fuel supply chain [29]. Technologies such as HEFA-SPK, FT-SPK, and ATJ-SPK are considered drop-in fuels under ASTM D7566 due to their demonstrated performance, blending behavior, and combustion properties within commercial aviation systems [23,30,31].

3.4. Trends in Biofuel Technologies: Emerging Innovations vs. Established Solutions

With the support of AI-based bibliometric analysis, Table 3 provides an overview of the most studied SAF technologies over the last decade. It includes both technologies that have already been implemented in the aviation sector and those that remain under development or exploration. Each entry in the table summarizes the production method, key countries or institutions leading research or deployment, the level of aviation implementation potential, as well as the main technical advantages and limitations associated with each pathway. Prominent technologies such as HEFA-SPK and FT-SPK stand out due to their ASTM certification and commercial deployment, while others like DSHC, SIP, and CH are still facing technical, economic, or regulatory barriers. This comparative synthesis serves as a strategic reference point for evaluating the maturity and scalability of SAF technologies in support of the aviation sector’s decarbonization efforts.

This comparative framework is particularly relevant when combined with the TRL classification presented in Table 1 and Table 2, as it enables the identification of technologies that, despite having a high technological readiness level, may still face practical or economic barriers to widespread adoption. For instance, FT-SPK and ATJ-SPK exhibit TRLs between 6 and 8 and are already ASTM-certified (Annexes A1 and A5 of ASTM D7566), yet their high capital cost, complex gasification processes (FT), and limited energy density (ATJ) continue to constrain large-scale deployment [30,31,37]. Conversely, some pathways at lower TRLs, such as CHJ or DSHC, demonstrate notable advantages in terms of feedstock flexibility, the use of wet biomass or sugar-derived intermediates, and potential for carbon circularity, but remain at early development stages (TRL 4–6) with limited industrial demonstration and no current ASTM approval [26]. These contrasting cases illustrate how the integration of technical maturity metrics with broader performance characteristics offers a more nuanced understanding of the opportunities and limitations across SAF pathways, as reflected in Table 2 and Table 3.

In reviewing the technological landscape presented in Table 3, it is evident that SAF research and deployment are currently concentrated in a few leading regions, notably the United States, European Union countries, and China. These regions host key institutions such as Gevo, Neste, Velocys, Sunfire, and Synfuels China, which are actively advancing both industrial implementation and technological innovation in pathways such as HEFA-SPK, FT-SPK, and PtL [26,31]. National and regional policies, coupled with strong research infrastructures and targeted investments, have significantly accelerated SAF development in these areas [30].

In contrast, Latin America remains underrepresented in terms of scientific publications and pilot-scale SAF initiatives, despite its favorable conditions, such as vast biomass availability, robust agricultural sectors, and growing interest in renewable energy. Countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico possess significant potential to develop and implement SAF technologies, particularly those based on bioethanol (e.g., ATJ) and lipid-based feedstocks (e.g., HEFA). However, the current lack of technological infrastructure, dedicated funding, and policy alignment limits the region’s contribution to global SAF innovation [13]. This gap underscores the need for greater regional collaboration, investment in R&D, and integration into international SAF initiatives to fully harness Latin America’s strategic bioresource advantages in the transition to sustainable aviation.

To complement the comparative insights offered in Table 3, Figure 8 provides a visual synthesis of SAF production pathways, beginning with categorized feedstocks and tracing their respective conversion routes through to potential aviation applications. Each connection reflects the specific type of conversion process, thermochemical, biological, hybrid, or electrochemical, applied to a given feedstock-technology pairing. Technologies that have achieved ASTM certification are linked to defined SAF blend limits (e.g., 50% or 10%), while those still in pilot or research phases are indicated as “Potential SAF” to denote their pre-commercial status. This integrated mapping highlights the diversity and interdependence of technological pathways and biomass sources, emphasizing how feedstock properties influence the conversion method and ultimate deployment viability. In doing so, Figure 8 serves as a strategic visual reference for understanding the alignment between resource availability, technological maturity, and SAF implementation potential.

3.5. Unlocking Regional Resources: SAF Production Opportunities in Latin America

Latin America represents a region of growing strategic importance in the development of SAF. Its favorable combination of agricultural productivity, biodiversity, and increasing environmental commitments offers a unique opportunity to position the region as a significant SAF producer. Several countries are currently advancing concrete projects that integrate local feedstocks, public–private partnerships, and emerging conversion technologies to accelerate SAF deployment.

In Panama, one of the most ambitious initiatives is the Golden City Biorefinery, led by SGP BioEnergy in collaboration with government stakeholders. Announced in 2022 and expected to begin operations by 2025, this facility is designed to become the world’s largest advanced biorefinery for SAF and renewable diesel. With an estimated production capacity of up to 180,000 barrels per day, the project aims to process multiple feedstocks, including waste oils and agricultural biomass, using HEFA and Fischer–Tropsch routes [39,40].

Brazil has consolidated its leadership in biofuel development by expanding into SAF production. National research institutes, such as FAPESP, have launched studies to enable ATJ and HEFA technologies using sugarcane ethanol, soybean oil, and animal fats. The country has conducted feasibility assessments for deploying SAF at scale, with technical validation aligned to international standards. Brazilian participation in multilateral initiatives like the Global Framework for SAF Deployment reflects both political and industrial readiness [41,42].

In Paraguay, the Omega Green project, led by ECB Group, constitutes South America’s first commercial-scale plant exclusively dedicated to SAF and HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) production. Located in Villeta and supported by a free trade zone agreement, the facility secured over USD 1.5 billion in investment. Construction has advanced since the agreement with the government, and the plant will process soybean oil, used cooking oil, and animal fats to serve European and North American markets. It is expected to begin operations in the short term [43,44].

Colombia has also made significant progress. In 2024, Ecopetrol successfully completed a test flight using SAF, marking a national milestone in sustainable aviation. The company announced plans to invest up to USD 700 million to develop a dedicated SAF production facility, expected to start operations by 2025 [43,44]. Additionally, private initiatives such as BioD are actively planning and constructing SAF plants that will utilize waste oils and fats through HEFA-SPK processes. These projects aim to contribute to national fuel mandates and position Colombia as a regional SAF supplier by 2030 [45,46].

Furthermore, several studies have assessed the potential for SAF deployment in Colombia. In particular, López Gómez et al. [20] performed a PESTEL based diagnosis that identified the main political, economic, technological, and environmental challenges, while highlighting sugarcane, palm oil, corn, and coffee residues as key feedstocks. Their recommendations stress the importance of coordinated research and development investment and supply-chain development to enable large-scale production and secure Colombia’s competitiveness in international markets.

These national initiatives reflect broader regional trends identified by international organizations such as IATA, which emphasize the role of Latin America in scaling up SAF production through second-generation feedstocks and flexible technology platforms. In combination with supportive policy frameworks and global demand for low-carbon fuels, these developments position the region as a strategic supplier for international aviation. However, to fully unlock its potential, Latin America must address challenges related to regulatory harmonization, infrastructure readiness, and financing mechanisms [47,48,49].

4. Conclusions

This study provides a comprehensive and integrated overview of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), highlighting the importance of adopting a multidisciplinary approach rooted in chemical engineering principles to accelerate their development and large-scale implementation. The bibliometric analysis conducted in this work shows that research on SAF has expanded considerably during the last decade, with a clear transition from general assessments to studies focused on advanced biofuels, catalyst improvement, process intensification, and system optimization. This shift reflects both the growing maturity of the field and the urgency to reduce emissions from the aviation sector in accordance with global climate commitments.

Within the technological landscape, HEFA-SPK and FT-SPK stand out as the most mature and widely studied routes. Both have achieved ASTM certification and demonstrate a level of technological readiness that enables commercial application. In contrast, pathways such as ATJ, SIP, and DSHC remain in earlier stages of development due to operational, catalytic, and economic limitations. Even so, these emerging routes possess long-term potential to diversify feedstocks, reduce environmental impacts, and expand SAF production capacity once their technical and economic barriers are addressed.

Chemical engineering plays a central role in optimizing SAF production. Advances in reaction engineering, thermochemical conversion, bioprocess integration, feedstock pretreatment, and heat and mass transfer can significantly enhance conversion efficiencies and reduce production costs. Complementing these advances with robust life-cycle and techno-economic assessment will be essential for guiding investment decisions and designing more sustainable and efficient fuel production systems.

The study also emphasizes the importance of regional strategies for SAF development. Latin America demonstrates considerable potential due to its abundant biomass resources, consolidated agro-industrial infrastructure, and growing research activity. Countries such as Brazil and Colombia illustrate how coordinated public and private initiatives can encourage pilot projects, certified test flights, and the establishment of early production capabilities. These experiences highlight the relevance of tailoring SAF strategies to regional feedstock availability, logistical conditions, and technological capacity.

In conclusion, the transition toward a low-carbon aviation sector depends not only on technological innovation but also on coordinated and sustained collaboration among academia, industry, and policy makers. Overcoming the current barriers to SAF adoption will require stable regulatory frameworks, economic incentives, investment in research and development, and the creation of reliable and sustainable supply chains. Advancing SAF from promising alternatives to widely accessible commercial fuels will depend on building integrated solutions that are technically feasible, economically competitive, and environmentally responsible.

This is the first Qatari investment in the Suez Canal Economic Zone, and it aligns with Egypt's green energy production ambitions.
It also highlights the growing economic and investment ties between Cairo and Doha, which economists say are warming at a critical time.
The sustainable jet fuel produced by the new factory is expected to reduce harmful emissions by 50-80% compared with conventional jet fuel, according to Egyptian officials.
It also aligns with global aviation decarbonisation efforts and Egypt's push for export-oriented renewable fuel production, particularly from renewable sources, environmentalists said.","Egypt and Qatar are expanding their economic and investment partnership through a series of joint projects, the latest of which is a first-in-Egypt production facility for sustainable aviation fuel.

Announced on 14 December, in the presence of the Egyptian prime minister, the new venture will include a new factory in the Suez Canal Economic Zone, Egypt's international investment magnet along the Suez Canal, the shortest link between Asia and Europe.

To be established by Qatar-based Al Mana Holding, a diversified conglomerate with interests across energy, automotive, and real estate, the new factory will cover more than 100,000 square metres.

The Qatari conglomerate will invest $200 million in the first phase of the project, with subsequent phases expected to reach $500 million.

Upon completion, the new factory is expected to be operational by the end of 2027 and produce 600,000 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel, utilising used cooking oil in its production.

Al Mana Holding has already secured a long-term deal with a major international energy company to purchase the factory's entire output, which will be exported to global markets.

This is the first Qatari investment in the Suez Canal Economic Zone, and it aligns with Egypt's green energy production ambitions.

It also highlights the growing economic and investment ties between Cairo and Doha, which economists say are warming at a critical time.

An ambitious plan

The new project could move Egypt a step closer to its goal of becoming an international hub for green energy production, according to experts.

The sustainable jet fuel produced by the new factory is expected to reduce harmful emissions by 50-80% compared with conventional jet fuel, according to Egyptian officials.

It also aligns with global aviation decarbonisation efforts and Egypt's push for export-oriented renewable fuel production, particularly from renewable sources, environmentalists said.

""Egypt has taken a series of measures in the past years to become an international green energy production hub,"" environmentalist Osama Abu Qura told The New Arab.

""The new factory contributes to these efforts, capitalising on what Egypt already has, including the human capital, production requirements and the ease to export output to foreign markets,"" he added.

Egypt plans to increase the share of renewables in power generation to 42% by 2030 and 60% by 2040, a significant jump from the current 12% share. Cairo's goal is to raise this share to 20% in 2025/2026.

Egypt also launched its National Strategy for Low-Carbon Hydrogen in 2024, aiming to become a global leader in green hydrogen production and export, targeting 5-8% of the tradable market by 2040.

Progress toward achieving those goals has been slower than expected due to grid and financing constraints, as well as past energy shortages. Nevertheless, international partnerships are accelerating implementation.

The factory will be established in the Integrated Sokhna Zone at Ain Sokhna on the Red Sea, an ideal location for the project due to its strategic, logistical, infrastructure, and policy advantages.

The zone is a prime logistics and export hub, located along the Suez Canal, which accounts for an average of 12% of global trade. The site also directly connects its industrial area to Sokhna Port, enabling easy import of feedstocks, particularly used cooking oil, which will be utilised to produce sustainable jet fuel and then exported to the international market.

Growing partnership

The new deal is part of billions of dollars in investment pledges from Doha to Cairo over the past months, reflecting a strengthening partnership.

These new investments build on broader economic cooperation between the two capitals, with total existing Qatari investments in Egypt reaching around $3.2 billion across a wide range of sectors, including finance, industry and tourism.

In April this year, Qatar pledged $7.5 billion in direct investments to Egypt during a visit to Doha by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

In November, Qatari Diar signed a deal to establish a luxury development in the Semla and Alam al-Roum areas on Egypt's Mediterranean coast, including residential areas, hotels, golf courses, marinas, and schools.

With a total value of $29.7 billion, the deal includes a $3.5 billion cash payment to the Egyptian government by the end of this December.

This avalanche of Qatari investments, observers said, reflects improving relations between Egypt and Qatar, a development that serves the best interests of both states.

""Such projects are very important for the [Egyptian] economy because they create jobs, bring in foreign currency and stimulate production,"" leading Egyptian economist Khaled al-Shafie said to TNA, citing ""remarkable"" investment opportunities in Egypt.

""Egypt stands at the crossroads of important markets in Africa and Asia,"" al-Shafie said. ""In the past decade, it also revolutionised its infrastructure, turning into a suitable environment for businesses of all types.""

""The two countries are developing a win-win model where Qatari money fuels Egypt's development,"" al-Shafie added.

He noted that, in return, Qatari companies benefit from Egypt's investment incentives and gain access to multiple markets through the preferential deals Egypt has signed with these markets.

""Egypt also possesses the largest market in the region, where a huge consumer base brings in assured profits for investors,"" he said.

The same investments come as Egypt struggles to overcome the toll that regional and international geopolitical developments are having on its economy.

Israel's war on Gaza and instability in the Red Sea have cost the Egyptian economy dearly, including the loss of revenues for the Suez Canal and tourism, amounting to over $13 billion during the two years of Israel's genocidal war.

Beyond economic cooperation, Cairo and Doha are also cooperating on many regional issues, including Gaza, where the two capitals partnered with the US to hammer out a ceasefire, albeit apparently one-sided, that took effect in mid-October between Hamas and Israel.

They are also cooperating with Washington to develop the controversial ""stabilisation force"" that will take over Gaza during the second phase of the deal.

This cooperation, Qatari political analysts say, is part of a changing regional landscape in which regional powers are finding ways to move beyond their differences and leverage their newfound amity to bolster regional stability and advance their own development interests.

""The regional landscape is undergoing swift change, the close Qatari-Egyptian cooperation being one of the most remarkable features of this change,"" Qatari political analyst Gaber Al Harami said.

Close political and diplomatic coordination between the two countries, he told TNA, also contributes to regional stability.",https://www.newarab.com/sites/default/files/styles/new_arab_overlay_medium_16_9/public/2216988426.jpeg?itok=uf7nMkqJ,N,,2025-12-18 07:56:43.391663

The US airline made progress in 2025 against its sustainability targets, through a series of strategic procurement decisions and supplier partnerships, aimed at improving efficiency and developing next-generation aircraft.

The carrier surpassed its near-term fuel savings goal, delivering more than 55 million gallons of jet fuel savings from operational improvements in the first quarter alone.

This achievement resulted in cost savings of over US$125m contributing to its net zero ambitions. These savings were a result of Delta's cross-enterprise Carbon Council, which implemented measures including onboard weight reduction, new landing procedures and drag-reduction technologies.

Strategic sourcing and efficiency measures

Delta's Carbon Council was instrumental in the fuel savings realised in 2025.

The council focused on several key operational areas, such as optimising aircraft speed and routing and using technology to track and minimise Auxiliary Power Unit usage between flights.

While the individual impact of these initiatives could be viewed as small, their collective effect has made a notable contribution to reducing Delta’s emissions.

To foster a culture of efficiency, the airline also introduced a “Green Station of the Year” programme. This initiative encourages employees to contribute to fuel-saving behaviours in their daily work, creating competition among frontline teams to identify and implement sustainability improvements.

Partnering for next-generation aircraft

A key part of Delta’s strategy involves investing in the future of aircraft design.

In March, the airline announced a partnership with aerospace start-up JetZero to support the development of its blended wing-body (BWB) aircraft.

This design is expected to be up to 50% more fuel efficient than many aircraft currently in operation. Through its Sustainable Skies Lab, Delta is providing operational expertise to help bring the BWB aircraft closer to commercial viability.

In September, a partnership was formed with Maeve Aerospace to expedite the development of hybrid-electric aircraft for regional flights. Maeve's aircraft aims to cut fuel consumption and emissions by up to 40% using conventional jet fuel.

“As we work toward the next generation of aircraft we look to partners like Maeve who embody the forward-thinking innovation we champion at Delta – solutions that advance aircraft design enhance operational efficiency elevate employee and customer experiences and cut emissions,” says Kristen Bojko, Vice President of Fleet at Delta Air Lines.

Delta also deepened its relationship with Airbus, testing a technique called fello'fly, where two aircraft fly in formation to improve fuel efficiency. According to Airbus, the practice can reduce fuel consumption by 5% on long-haul flights.

Innovative materials and SAF investment

Delta is also exploring novel technologies through its Sustainable Skies Lab.

The airline has added MicroTau, an Australian company that has created an external aircraft cladding that mimics shark skin to reduce drag.

MicroTau estimates the technology which can be applied to an aircraft's fuselage wings and tail may improve fuel efficiency by up to 4%.

Regarding fuel, Delta is on track to increase its use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 50% compared to last year.

In a 2025 project with Shell Aviation, Montana Renewables and the Port of Portland, the airline participated in the first-ever commercial-scale delivery of SAF to Portland International Airport.

According to Airbus, SAF can reduce an airline’s emissions by up to 80%. Acknowledging the current supply constraints, investments from airlines like Delta are crucial for scaling SAF production.

The airline’s focus this year has also been on procuring more than 35 sustainable aircraft, which on average are over 25% more fuel efficient per seat mile than the aircraft it has retired since 2019.

On the ground, Delta has switched to paper cups across its entire operation and opened new facilities at Seattle-Tacoma International, designed with sustainability in mind.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/b9353d940f88d4abc637cedac4d8a49a:31f953c6fba549c6d858c596f7907842/delta-s-centennial-year-saw-the-airline-make-some-progress-against-its-net-zero-targets.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 07:56:47.558340

Before the extracted bio-oil can be refined into aviation fuel, it must be purified of mainly nitrogen-containing interfering ions.
These unwanted ions would otherwise have a negative impact on the subsequent conversion into a sustainable aviation fuel.
Consortium leader Kienberger Marlene emphasises: “Our clear goal is to produce sustainable aviation fuel based on tomato waste at a competitive sales price.
The official project start date for “ToFuel: An integrated biorefinery for sustainable aviation fuel production from tomato residues” is 1 January 2026.","Waste from tomato processing will serve to power aircraft. Under the leadership of Graz University of Technology (TU Graz), the EU project ToFuel is developing a new biorefinery concept that will convert tomato residues into sustainable aviation fuel as well as into fertiliser, animal feed and nutritional oil. The research team is aiming for a waste-free and climate-neutral process that is also economically competitive and thus makes an important contribution to the defossilization of air transport

Tomatoes are the second most consumed vegetable in the world after potatoes. The EU is the third largest producer with around 17 megatonnes of tomatoes harvested. However, tomato production produces large quantities of residual biomass – plant material such as flowers, leaves and stems, peel, seeds and tomatoes of inadequate quality. Most of these residues are incinerated as agricultural waste or disposed of at high cost. At the same time, the goal of European climate neutrality and the associated reduction of CO₂ emissions in the aviation sector is largely dependent on the production of competitive and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) from renewable raw materials.

“According to estimates, around three per cent of the sustainable aviation fuels required in Europe by 2030 could be covered from the amount of tomato pomace produced throughout the EU, i.e. the residues from tomato processing,” explains project manager Kienberger Marlene from the Institute of Chemical Engineering and Environmental Technology at TU Graz.

In order to turn tomato waste into a high-quality fuel, the biomass must first be processed so that microorganisms can utilise it efficiently. ToFuel is investigating two modern fractionation technologies. During extrusion, the biomass is treated under heat and pressure and then broken down into its cellular components by an abrupt drop in pressure. This creates an optimally digested biomass for the subsequent fermentation process, in which microorganisms produce lipids that are later processed into aviation fuel. In the second fractionation technology, hydrothermal liquefaction, the biomass is converted into bio-oil and biochar under high pressure and at high temperatures. Before the extracted bio-oil can be refined into aviation fuel, it must be purified of mainly nitrogen-containing interfering ions. These unwanted ions would otherwise have a negative impact on the subsequent conversion into a sustainable aviation fuel. The corresponding fractionation, biotechnological and purification processes are being developed by the Laboratório Nacional de Energia e Geologia ( LNEG - Laboratorio de Energia ) in Lisbon, TU Graz and the University of Zagreb / Sveučilište u Zagrebu in close cooperation.

The processes developed in the project are gradually being scaled up to a pre-industrial scale and comprehensively tested. Consortium leader Kienberger Marlene emphasises: “Our clear goal is to produce sustainable aviation fuel based on tomato waste at a competitive sales price. Ultimately, sustainable aviation fuels simply have to be economically viable.”The project team is also analysing the ecological, economic and social impact of the technologies. The utilisation of tomato residues also creates new sources of income for food processing companies.

The official project start date for “ToFuel: An integrated biorefinery for sustainable aviation fuel production from tomato residues” is 1 January 2026. A total of eleven partners from seven European countries are working on ToFuel. In addition to TU Graz, these include the Portuguese research institute LNEG - Laboratorio de Energia , the University of Zagreb / Sveučilište u Zagrebu , Technische Universität Wien , LUT University in Finland, University of Leoben and the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft . Industry partners Mutti and Podravka will provide tomato residues and contribute their many years of expertise in processing plant-based raw materials. The research will be accompanied by a comprehensive commercialisation and publication strategy, which will be developed by the project partners ESEIA - European Sustainable Energy Innovation Alliance and Energy Efficiency in Industrial Processes - EEIP . At least six PhDs, twelve master’s and 15 bachelor’s students are to be trained as part of the project.

Egypt has entered into a USD 200 million partnership with Qatar’s Al Mana Holding to establish a large-scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production facility in Ain Sokhna, within the Suez Canal Economic Zone on the Red Sea coast. The project underscores Egypt’s accelerating shift toward renewable energy, industrial sustainability, and export-oriented green manufacturing.

Developed over three phases on 100,000 square metres in the Integrated Sokhna industrial zone, the facility will convert used cooking oil into aviation fuel. The first phase alone is expected to produce 200,000 tonnes of SAF annually, positioning the project as one of the most ambitious clean aviation fuel initiatives on the African continent.

The agreement marks the first industrial investment by a Qatari company in the Suez Canal Economic Zone, highlighting deepening economic ties between Cairo and Doha. Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly described the project as evidence of renewed momentum in bilateral relations, driven by political alignment and expanding economic cooperation. It follows Qatar’s recent announcement of USD 29.7 billion in investments in Egypt’s tourism and real estate sectors—the largest since diplomatic relations were restored after the 2017–2021 Gulf rift.

Beyond its bilateral significance, the SAF project places Egypt at the forefront of clean aviation fuel development in Africa. While countries such as Kenya, Ethiopia, and South Africa remain largely at pilot or feasibility stages—often focused on road-transport biofuels—Egypt is moving directly into commercial-scale production with defined capacity targets and strong international backing. Morocco, despite its advanced renewable energy base, remains more focused on green hydrogen than aviation fuel.

Egypt’s choice of the Suez Canal Economic Zone provides a decisive strategic advantage. Located along one of the world’s busiest maritime corridors and close to major international airports, the zone offers efficient logistics for exporting SAF to Europe, the Middle East, and across Africa. Comparable logistics ecosystems are largely absent elsewhere on the continent, where regulatory uncertainty or limited industrial infrastructure often constrains green fuel exports.

The project also reflects Egypt’s distinctive financing model. Rather than relying primarily on Western development banks or multilateral institutions, Egypt is increasingly leveraging Gulf capital from partners such as Qatar, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia—allowing for faster capital deployment and fewer policy conditionalities than those faced by many African peers.

Egypt’s ongoing economic pressures, including rising external debt and fiscal constraints, have further accelerated reforms and openness to large-scale foreign investment. In this context, the SAF initiative aligns economic necessity with climate objectives, a balance that many African economies are still struggling to achieve at scale.

Taken together, the SAF agreement and parallel Qatari investments illustrate how Egypt is using energy, infrastructure, and industrial projects as tools of economic recovery and regional diplomacy. Compared with other African nations still laying the groundwork for energy transition, Egypt is already executing—positioning itself as a continental hub for sustainable aviation fuel and a leader in green industrial development.

Aviation Fuel Production from Tomato Residues: TU Graz Coordinates Visionary EU project

Susanne Filzwieser Kommunikation und Marketing

Technische Universität Graz

Residual biomass from tomato production is turned into climate-friendly aviation fuel. The aim of the EU ToFuel project is to develop a waste-free and CO₂-neutral biorefinery concept that produces sustainable and economically competitive aviation fuel.

Waste from tomato processing will serve to power aircraft. Under the leadership of Graz University of Technology (TU Graz), the EU project ToFuel is developing a new biorefinery concept that will convert tomato residues into sustainable aviation fuel as well as into fertiliser, animal feed and nutritional oil. The research team is aiming for a waste-free and climate-neutral process that is also economically competitive and thus makes an important contribution to the defossilization of air transport.

Residual material as a valuable resource

Tomatoes are the second most consumed vegetable in the world after potatoes. The EU is the third largest producer with around 17 megatonnes of tomatoes harvested. However, tomato production produces large quantities of residual biomass – plant material such as flowers, leaves and stems, peel, seeds and tomatoes of inadequate quality. Most of these residues are incinerated as agricultural waste or disposed of at high cost.

At the same time, the goal of European climate neutrality and the associated reduction of CO₂ emissions in the aviation sector is largely dependent on the production of competitive and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) from renewable raw materials. “According to estimates, around three per cent of the sustainable aviation fuels required in Europe by 2030 could be covered from the amount of tomato pomace produced throughout the EU, i.e. the residues from tomato processing,” explains project manager Marlene Kienberger from the Institute of Chemical Engineering and Environmental Technology at TU Graz.

From plant to oil to aviation fuel

In order to turn tomato waste into a high-quality fuel, the biomass must first be processed so that microorganisms can utilise it efficiently. ToFuel is investigating two modern fractionation technologies. During extrusion, the biomass is treated under heat and pressure and then broken down into its cellular components by an abrupt drop in pressure. This creates an optimally digested biomass for the subsequent fermentation process, in which microorganisms produce lipids that are later processed into aviation fuel. In the second fractionation technology, hydrothermal liquefaction, the biomass is converted into bio-oil and biochar under high pressure and at high temperatures.

Before the extracted bio-oil can be refined into aviation fuel, it must be purified of mainly nitrogen-containing interfering ions. These unwanted ions would otherwise have a negative impact on the subsequent conversion into a sustainable aviation fuel. The corresponding fractionation, biotechnological and purification processes are being developed by the Laboratório Nacional de Energia e Geologia (LNEG) in Lisbon, TU Graz and the University of Zagreb in close cooperation.

The lipids and bio-oil are then converted into a fuel that fulfils the international quality standards for sustainable aviation fuel using the HEFA process at the University of Leoben. HEFA stands for “hydrogenated esters and fatty acids” and is a process for producing sustainable aviation fuel from vegetable, animal or recycled fats and oils.

The processes developed in the project are gradually being scaled up to a pre-industrial scale and comprehensively tested. Consortium leader Marlene Kienberger emphasises: “Our clear goal is to produce sustainable aviation fuel based on tomato waste at a competitive sales price. Ultimately, sustainable aviation fuels simply have to be economically viable.” The project team is also analysing the ecological, economic and social impact of the technologies. The utilisation of tomato residues also creates new sources of income for food processing companies.

The official project start date for “ToFuel: An integrated biorefinery for sustainable aviation fuel production from tomato residues” is 1 January 2026. A total of eleven partners from seven European countries are working on ToFuel. In addition to TU Graz, these include the Portuguese research institute LNEG, the University of Zagreb, Vienna University of Technology, Lappeenranta University of Technology in Finland, University of Leoben and the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. Industry partners Mutti and Podravka will provide tomato residues and contribute their many years of expertise in processing plant-based raw materials. The research will be accompanied by a comprehensive commercialisation and publication strategy, which will be developed by the project partners ESEIA and EEIP. At least six PhDs, twelve master’s and 15 bachelor’s students are to be trained as part of the project. The project budget amounts to 3.5 million euros over four years, one million of which will go to the consortium leader TU Graz.

The collaboration would seek to increase long-term SAF supply across multiple production pathways while advancing the transparency and commercialization of environmental attributes.
Carl Stanton, chairman of DevvStream, said, ""Integrating environmental assets directly into the fuel value chain is essential to accelerating SAF deployment.
Potential multi-pathway SAF collaboration and offtake framework The parties intend to explore a long-term offtake framework under which XCF could purchase SAF which will eventually be produced by Southern, subject to mutual agreement on commercial terms, in order to capitalize on long-term global demand for SAF.
Exploration of New Rise Louisiana SAF facility The parties plan to assess the potential development of New Rise Louisiana, a proposed HEFA SAF facility.","XCF Global Inc., Southern Energy Renewables Inc., and DevvStream Corp. on Dec. 12 announced a non-binding tripartite memorandum of understanding (MOU) to jointly explore the potential development of a next-generation low-carbon fuels platform designed to accelerate SAF adoption, expand domestic capacity, and integrate environmental-attribute monetization into a unified customer offering.

By 2030, the U.S. SAF market is projected to reach nearly $7 billion, while global demand is expected to exceed 5.5 billion gallons, supporting a global market of more than $25 billion. By that time, approximately 4 billion people are expected to live in countries that utilize SAF for air transportation. Looking ahead to 2050, the global SAF market could exceed $250 billion. This collaboration is intended to position the parties around a unified platform that directly supports this long-term growth.

The collaboration would seek to increase long-term SAF supply across multiple production pathways while advancing the transparency and commercialization of environmental attributes. As part of the negotiation of a binding agreement, the parties expect to evaluate the commercial viability of developing a HEFA-based SAF facility in Louisiana.

Potential unified commercial platform and strategic integration

The parties intend to negotiate a definitive collaboration agreement which, if executed, would create a collaborative venture that intends to develop a unified commercial platform that enables customers to procure fuel, logistics services, and environmental-attribute value through a single integrated offering. If developed, this structure would be expected to simplify procurement, improve pricing efficiency, and enhance long-term customer retention across the aviation and industrial markets.

Chris Cooper, CEO of XCF Global, said, ""This collaboration has the potential to create the foundation for a first-of-its-kind, fully integrated low-carbon fuels platform - linking production, logistics, and environmental-attribute systems into a seamless value chain. If we succeed in combining Southern's developmental stage biomass-to-methanol-to-jet technology, DevvStream's environmental-attribute and digital MRV capabilities, and XCF's HEFA production and commercial infrastructure, we see the potential to build a revolutionary end-to-end system that unlocks new value for customers and potentially accelerate the scaling of SAF in a disciplined, capital-efficient way.

""Our goal is to modernize how low-carbon fuels are produced, certified, and delivered - not as isolated components, but as an integrated solution aligned with the needs of global aviation and corporate sustainability programs.""

Potential environmental-attribute monetization and digital infrastructure

A core component of the potential collaboration is expected to be the integration of environmental-attribute capabilities, including voluntary and compliance carbon credits, CORSIA units, renewable energy certificates, digital MRV solutions, and tokenized environmental-attribute tracking systems. Under the MOU, DevvStream is expected to lead the generation, verification, and monetization of environmental assets associated with the potential platform's low-carbon fuels.

The parties plan to work towards jointly evaluating solutions to help customers capture, verify, and monetize environmental attributes, including LCFS credits, RINs, and benefits under 45Z/45Q. The parties also plan to evaluate lifecycle analysis (""LCA"") methodologies and carbon-intensity optimization systems which may strengthen project economics and support high-integrity SAF development.

Carl Stanton, chairman of DevvStream, said, ""Integrating environmental assets directly into the fuel value chain is essential to accelerating SAF deployment. This collaboration has the potential to bring together three distinct strengths - XCF's production expertise, Southern's developing advanced biomass platform, and DevvStream's environmental-asset monetization capabilities - to help improve project economics while giving airlines confidence in the integrity of their SAF purchases.""

Potential multi-pathway SAF collaboration and offtake framework

The parties intend to explore a long-term offtake framework under which XCF could purchase SAF which will eventually be produced by Southern, subject to mutual agreement on commercial terms, in order to capitalize on long-term global demand for SAF.

A key anchor for the potential collaboration is Southern's planned biomass-to-fuel facility in Louisiana, expected to produce approximately 28 million gallons of SAF and 220 kilotons of methanol per year, supported by an estimated $1.4 billion total project investment, according to Southern.

The parties further intend to explore multiple SAF production pathways with the goal of accelerating the adoption of SAF worldwide to address the forecasted industry demand noted above, including:

Southern's in-development, next-generation biomass-to-methanol-to-jet SAF platform;

XCF's HEFA-based SAF platform; and

Joint carbon-intensity and co-product optimization strategies

Jay Patel, CEO of Southern, added, ""We believe partnering with XCF and DevvStream would strengthen our ability to scale a multi-pathway SAF strategy grounded in real production capacity and real climate benefit. We are eager to work together to further develop our experimental $SAF token on Solana with DevvStream. Further, we believe Louisiana has the workforce, infrastructure, and feedstock resources to become a national leader in low-carbon fuels, and we see this potential collaboration as a major step toward that future.""

Exploration of New Rise Louisiana SAF facility

The parties plan to assess the potential development of New Rise Louisiana, a proposed HEFA SAF facility. The evaluation process is expected to include engineering, permitting, feedstock integration, logistics, and financing strategies.

XCF and Southern also plan to evaluate municipal financing pathways in Louisiana, following recent momentum from the Louisiana Community Development Authority, which authorized up to $402 million in potential revenue bonds for Southern's biomass-to-fuel project, subject to additional approvals, documentation, and market conditions. While not representing committed capital and there can be no assurance that any such bonds will ultimately be issued or that any particular amount of funding will be available, the authorization underscores Louisiana's growing role as a U.S. clean-energy manufacturing hub. Any XCF participation in Louisiana municipal financing strategies would be separate from and in addition to Southern's existing authorization. There can be no assurance that XCF will be able to secure any Louisiana municipal financing.

Cooper added, ""We believe Louisiana offers a compelling combination of infrastructure, talent, and policy support. We expect our evaluation of New Rise Louisiana will allow us to determine whether our modular HEFA platform can complement Southern's developing biomass capabilities while fitting squarely within our disciplined, capital-efficient growth model.""

The MOU reflects a shared intent to collaborate on SAF and other low-carbon fuel opportunities. Any specific offtake arrangements, investments, or project development activities described in this release remain subject to confirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, internal corporate approvals, and any required regulatory or permitting approvals.

I. GLOBAL

Conference of the Parties 30th annual meeting (COP30) plan to further global investment in climate action

From November 10 to November 21, 2025, nearly 200 countries participated in the United Nation’s (UN) 30th annual climate meeting, COP30 held in Belém, Brazil. For the first time since its convening in 1995, the United States was absent from the COP. Leaders from each country in attendance agreed on a few notable climate action initiatives, such as the Mutirão Decision and the Gender Action Plan, as reflected in the final outcomes report. The Mutirão Decision addresses financing and investment in climate-based initiatives, including calling for the tripling of adaptation finance by 2030 compared to 2025 levels. Two key provisions of this decision are the Global Implementation Accelerator, which aims to help countries implement adaptation plans, and the Belém Mission to 1.5, which is a platform designed to “foster enhanced ambition and international cooperation across mitigation, adaptation, and investment.” The Mutirão Decision also addresses the role of trade in climate action by calling for a dialogue with the World Trade Organisation, United Nations Trade and Development, and International Trade Centre to consider the “opportunities, challenges and barriers in relation to enhancing international cooperation related to the role of trade.” The Gender Action Plan contains provisions meant to address the ways in which climate change, as the UN Women organization states, “is not gender neutral.” This document aims to serve as a tool for governments, policymakers, and private parties that provide climate finance and anticipates that these parties will consider the unique risks women and girls experience from climate change and advance “gender-responsive climate policies,” including in the following areas: capacity-building and knowledge sharing, participation and leadership, implementation, and monitoring and reporting. Notably, criticism of COP30 was that while discussed, no agreement on the transition away from fossil fuels or halting of deforestation was adopted in the final text.

Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (ISS) and Glass Lewis & Co. (Glass Lewis) publish updated proxy voting guidelines

On November 25, 2025, ISS published its 2026 U.S. Benchmark Policy Changes, which are effective for meetings on or after February 1, 2026. ISS made several changes related to executive compensation, non-employee director compensation, capital structures, and environmental and social shareholder proposals, among others. In particular, ISS’s U.S. policy updates include a change in approach to shareholder proposals: rather than generally recommending votes “for” certain environmental and social shareholder proposals, ISS will now make recommendations on a case-by-case basis. This change applies to proposals requesting disclosure of climate change-related risks; greenhouse gas emissions; diversity policies, initiatives, or workforce data; supplier or human rights policies; and political contributions and trade association policies and activities. The 2026 updates also make certain changes to the factors that ISS will consider when determining its voting recommendations for these proposals. As rationale for these changes, ISS cited feedback from clients, declining shareholder support, the changing regulatory landscape, changes in company practices, and improvement in company disclosures in the past few years. ISS’s global approach to these proposals has been and continues to be to generally recommend votes on a case-by-case basis considering a variety of factors focusing on whether “implementation of the proposal is likely to enhance or protect shareholder value.”

Glass Lewis recently published its 2026 Benchmark Policy Guidelines (GL 2026 Guidelines). The GL 2026 Guidelines include updates regarding pay-for-performance methodology, mandatory arbitration provisions in governing documents, amendments to a company’s governing documents, and shareholder proposals. With regard to shareholder proposals specifically, the GL 2026 Guidelines removed language indicating that Glass Lewis may “in certain very limited circumstances” recommend votes against members of a company’s governance committee if Glass Lewis believes that the company has omitted a shareholder proposal via the Rule 14a-8 no-action request process in such a way that exclusion “is detrimental to shareholders.” Instead, the GL 2026 Guidelines refer to recent changes in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) changed approach to shareholder proposals and note that Glass Lewis is monitoring the “SEC’s ongoing changes and their ramifications” and may update its voting guidelines “prior to or during the 2026 proxy season should its approach to these matters change or regulatory developments warrant such an update,” while noting that the “basic premise” of Glass Lewis’s policy is that “shareholders should be afforded the opportunity to vote on matters of material importance.” The GL 2026 Guidelines also removed discussion related to oversight of environmental and social issues, including language that indicated Glass Lewis would recommend votes against members of the board, in favor of shareholder proposals, and/or against management proposals if companies “have not provided for explicit, board-level oversight of environmental and social matters and/or when a substantial environmental or social risk has been ignored or inadequately addressed.”

The GL 2026 Guidelines have retained Glass Lewis’s policy regarding board diversity, including a reference to its March 2025 “Supplemental Statement on Diversity Considerations at U.S. Companies.” As described in our March 2025 ESG Update, while Glass Lewis’s policy expects diversity on companies’ boards (generally expecting 30% gender diversity and at least one director from an underrepresented community) and disclosure of individual or aggregate demographic information for directors, when recommending votes against a director related to diversity, Glass Lewis will offer clients two recommendations: “one that applies [the] Benchmark Policy approach as articulated in [the] 2025 Benchmark Policy Guidelines for the US Market, and one that does not consider gender or underrepresented community diversity as part of the recommendation.” However, this approach may evolve in light of the Executive Order discussed below.

II. UNITED KINGDOM

The Transition Finance Council launches its second public consultation

On November 3, 2025, the Transition Finance Council published new drafts of (i) the Transition Finance Guidelines (Guidelines); and (ii) the Implementation Handbook. It also published a Consultation Question and Update and launched a corresponding second public consultation on the drafts. This follows a first consultation that closed last September, as a result of which the drafts were updated to revise the universal factors so they are more streamlined and better capable of assessment, map the guidelines to the Net Zero Investment Framework, and clarify the relationship between entity-level transition finance consistent with the Guidelines and green and sustainability-linked bonds and loans, amongst others. The consultation is open until January 30, 2026 and welcomes feedback from a range of stakeholders, including corporate entities and asset owners and managers.

The UK Government publishes amendments to the draft packaging waste regulations

On November 3, 2025, the UK Government published the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging and Packaging Waste) (Amendment) Regulations 2025 (Amended pEPR Regulations). The pEPR Regulations require businesses that supply packaging or packaged goods to cover the costs of managing household packaging waste and providing disposal information, intended to ensure that a portion of packaging is recycled and verified. The Amended pEPR Regulations will enable the appointment of a producer responsibility organisation (PRO) to take on key operational functions, allow producers to offset food-grade plastic packaging waste against their disposal cost obligations in certain circumstances, and aim to remove loopholes and improve clarity. Such amendments are due to come into force on January 1, 2026.

Other highlights:

On November 5, 2025, HM Treasury published its new financial inclusion strategy, setting out a national plan across six pillars to remove barriers to financial participation and build financial resilience. The strategy covers digital inclusion, access to banking, savings, insurance, and credit, tackling problem debt, and financial education, with review after two years. On November 28, 2025, the House of Commons Treasury Committee launched an inquiry into HM Treasury’s financial inclusion strategy and issued a call for evidence. Submissions are due by January 12, 2026.

On December 1, 2025, the Financial Conduct Authority published CP25/34 consulting on proposed regulation of ESG ratings providers, including requirements on transparency, governance and systems and controls, conflicts of interest, and stakeholder engagement. Responses are due by March 31, 2026, with final rules expected in the fourth quarter of 2026 and regulation applying from June 29, 2028.

On December 3, 2025, the Prudential Regulation Authority published PS25/25 confirming updates to its climate-related risks supervisory expectations, replacing SS3/19 with SS4/25. Changes include clarifying proportionality, recognizing litigation risk, clarifying the six-month review period, allowing integration into existing governance and risk registers, and a proportionate approach to climate scenario analysis.

III. EUROPE

Omnibus update: Omnibus trilogue in full swing as European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) revisions and reporting reliefs advance

Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD): After trilogue negotiations began on November 18, 2025, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU have now reached a political agreement on key elements of the Omnibus Simplification Package. The Council and the European Parliament have already confirmed the compromise. The final text still needs to be approved by the Council of the EU and will enter into force twenty days after its publication in the Official Journal. For further details please see our client alert.

Meanwhile, the European Commission’s “quick fix” Delegated Regulation (EU) 2025/1416 was published, providing transitional relief for Wave 1 companies. The regulation postpones certain ESRS disclosure requirements for the 2025 and 2026 financial years and extends phase-in provisions for complex topical standards such as biodiversity and social disclosures. This will allow Wave 1 companies to refrain from expanding their sustainability disclosures while the Omnibus Simplification Package is still under negotiations.

ESRS: On December 3, 2025, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) submitted its final technical advice on its draft of simplified ESRS to the European Commission, building on the Exposure Draft published on July 31, 2025 and the EFRAG Sustainability Reporting Board’s internal vote in late November 2025. The new ESRS aim to, among other things, simplify the materiality assessment, provide a stronger emphasis on usefulness of information, significantly reduce data points, and increase interoperability with the International Sustainability Standards Board. For further details, please see our latest client alert on this topic.

The European Commission indicated that it intends to review the draft and prepare its delegated act revising the original ESRS in the first half of 2026, with the applicability date of the new ESRS to be confirmed in the delegated act. The introductory wording in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2025/1416 seems to suggest that the revised standards will only start to apply for the reporting period of financial year 2027.

EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) update: European Parliament adopts proposal to postpone and simplify the EUDR

Following a provisional political agreement between the Council of the EU and the European Parliament on December 4, 2025, the European Parliament adopted the agreed upon amendments on December 17, 2025, which include, among other things, the following:

All businesses will have one additional year to comply with the EUDR. Large operators and traders will be in scope starting December 30, 2026, and small operators starting June 30, 2027.

The EUDR’s due diligence requirements will be simplified, obliging only businesses who first introduce the relevant product into the EU market, and reducing obligations for micro and small primary operators which would now only have to submit a one-off simplified declaration.

Next, the text must be endorsed by the Council and published in the Official Journal of the EU. For the amendments to enter into force as intended, the final text must be published before the end of 2025. If not, the current EUDR deadlines will continue to apply.

In this context, a recent joint industry letter should also be noted, which expressed concerns about reopening or delaying the EUDR, emphasizing that many companies have already invested substantially in compliance preparation and warning that a postponement could undermine regulatory certainty and the EUDR’s environmental objectives.

Decision of Regional Court Berlin on climate neutral claims

In line with a recent decision from the German Federal Court of Justice, the Regional Court Berlin similarly held in a decision dated October 16, 2025 that a company’s climate neutral claims were misleading, as they were lacking disclosure of the extent of reductions and offsetting. Simply referring to offsetting measures was considered insufficient. Further, the court held that it is necessary that companies communicate about the scope, nature, and effect of their reduction measures. The ruling is not binding yet.

European Commission proposes new product categories and lighter disclosures under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)

On November 20, 2025, the European Commission released its proposal to amend the SFDR. The proposal aims to improve the identification and analysis of sustainability-focused investment products after a comprehensive review of the SFDR by the European Commission showed that, among other things, the current framework produces overly long and complex disclosures and increases the risks of greenwashing and mis-selling.

To address these issues, the proposal introduces three new categories for funds based on their sustainability or transition characteristics: Sustainable, Transition, or ESG Basic. The new categories are defined by the industries and activities a financial product must exclude from its portfolio and by its positive contribution, with at least 70% of the portfolio required to follow an ESG strategy aligned with the product’s category. Furthermore, the European Commission plans to reduce disclosure obligations for financial market participants, particularly streamlining product-level disclosures, by focusing on available, comparable, and meaningful data tied to the new fund categories.

Other highlights:

The EU Ombudsman has identified a series of shortcomings in the European Commission’s process to launch its “Omnibus” initiative, pointing to “maladministration” by the European Commission and criticizing, among other things, the lack of public consultation.

The European Parliament and the Council of the EU have reached a provisional agreement to introduce a new binding target in the European Climate Law to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040.

Currently, 18 of the 30 EU Member and EEA States have transposed the “Stop-the-Clock” Directive into national law, including Finland, Sweden, and Denmark. An overview of the current transposition status of the CSRD into national laws and the “Stop-the-Clock” process under the Omnibus Simplification Package can be found here.

U.S. officials and enforcers scrutinize proxy advisory firms’ influence over shareholder voting

On December 11, 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing the SEC, Federal Trade Commission, and Department of Labor to take various actions “to end the outsized influence of proxy advisors that prioritize radical political agendas over investor returns.” The Executive Order specifically calls out ISS and Glass Lewis and alleges that that they “control more than 90 percent of the proxy advisor market.” While having no immediate impact on ISS and Glass Lewis, the Executive Order heightens the regulatory scrutiny of and pressure on proxy advisory firms’ practices and on the actions of their clients. For more information, see our client alert.

On November 12, 2025, media reports indicated that the Federal Trade Commission has opened a civil antitrust investigation into ISS and Glass Lewis, focusing on whether the firms’ practices constitute unfair methods of competition and how their recommendations impact shareholder votes, including on environmental and social shareholder proposals. The investigation reportedly examines the firms’ market position and competitive conduct in providing research, analysis, and voting advice to institutional investors.

On November 20, 2025, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier filed a complaint against ISS and Glass Lewis, alleging violations of state consumer protection and antitrust laws. According to the filing, the two firms “constitut[e] up to 97 percent of the market for proxy voting advice,” giving them “an astronomical impact on the American economy and corporate culture.” The complaint asserts that ISS and Glass Lewis have “used this enormous influence to push their own dogmatic agenda” and “controversial ideological mandates” rather than prioritize shareholder value. The filing also alleges coordinated conduct between ISS and Glass Lewis, asserting that the firms “agreed to move in lockstep, preventing competition and ensuring that neither will face competitive pressure.” The Attorney General seeks injunctive relief, damages, civil penalties, and other relief.

SEC Commissioner signals continued focus on “materiality only” in sustainability reporting

On November 21, 2025, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda delivered remarks at the U.S.–Japan Symposium organized by Harvard Law School’s Program on International Financial Systems. He stressed that sustainability or ESG-related disclosures should be required only when they are “financially material,” stating that non-financial policy metrics such as environmental policy issues should be reserved for environmental regulators, not financial regulators. Commissioner Uyeda reiterated that under the current U.S. disclosure framework, issuers must report climate or sustainability information only if it materially affects their business, financial condition, or operating results. He cautioned that imposing broader ESG mandates on corporate disclosure or stewardship regimes risks turning disclosure obligations into instruments for advancing “policy aspirations” and that doing so could blur the line between investor-relevant information and broader regulatory or political goals. The Commissioner’s remarks are consistent with prior comments, including those summarized in our May 2025 update.

Federal agencies advance deregulatory actions across water, wildlife, offshore leasing, and clean energy programs

Various federal agencies have continued to advance deregulatory actions, including the following:

On November 17, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps proposed a rule that would limit federal authority over wetlands and streams under the Clean Water Act by redefining key terms that affect the definition of “waters of the United States.” The proposed rule is intended to “cut red tape and provide predictability, consistency, and clarity for American industry, energy producers, the technology sector, farmers, ranchers, developers, businesses, and landowners for permitting under the Clean Water Act.” If finalized, the rule could significantly reduce the number of wetlands and bodies of water subject to federal permitting. The proposal is open for public comment until January 5, 2026.

On November 19, 2025, the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced four proposed rules that would reduce Endangered Species Act protections by reinstating aspects of the regulatory framework as they existed in 2019 and 2020. As summarized in the DOI’s announcement, the proposed rules revise “procedures and criteria used for listing, reclassifying, and delisting species on the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants and designating critical habitat,” reinstate prior definitions and processes related to interagency cooperation, eliminate the “blanket rule” in favor of species-specific protections for threatened species, and return to the 2020 approach to “consideration of the economic impact, the impact on national security, and any other relevant impact of designating any particular area as critical habitat.” The proposed rules are open for public comment until December 22, 2025.

On November 20, 2025, the DOI announced a proposal for a new offshore leasing program that would authorize as many as 34 lease sales across approximately 1.27 billion acres of federal waters in Alaska, the Gulf of America, and the Pacific coast. The DOI announcement stated that the plan aims to “open new opportunities for offshore investment and job creation, reinforce America’s role as a global energy leader, and help ensure a stable and secure energy supply well into the future.” The proposal is open for public comment until January 23, 2026.

On November 20, 2025, the Department of Energy announced an organizational realignment that eliminates the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations and the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and replaces them with a new entity called the Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation. The realignment aims to reflect the “priorities of expanding American energy production, accelerating scientific and technological leadership, and ensuring the continued safety and readiness of the Nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile.”

Other highlights:

On November 25, 2025, Senator Ted Cruz introduced the Stop TSP ESG Act to “prevent professional asset managers who manage federal employee retirement funds from using those taxpayer dollars to push Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies through corporate shareholder votes.” The announcement clarifies that the bill is concerned primarily with proxy voting by BlackRock Capital Advisers and State Street Global Advisors.

On November 27, 2025, the Canadian federal government and the province of Alberta signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to “strengthen energy collaboration and build a stronger, more competitive, and more sustainable economy.” The MOU suspends the planned federal oil and gas emissions cap and exempts Alberta from the federal Clean Electricity Regulations and instead commits Alberta to advancing the development of a bitumen pipeline, negotiating a new carbon pricing agreement, and supporting development of “the world’s largest” carbon capture and storage project.

On November 18, 2025, Canadian Minister of Finance and National Revenue François-Philippe Champagne introduced Bill C-15 to the Canadian House of Commons for first reading. Among other things, if enacted, the bill would amend the greenwashing provisions under the Competition Act by removing “the requirement that the substantiation of representations about the environmental benefits of businesses or business activities must be done in accordance with internationally recognized methodology.”

On November 18, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit enjoined California’s new climate-related risk reporting law pending an appeal by a coalition of leading business organizations challenging its constitutionality in the ongoing legal proceeding, and on December 1, 2025, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) responded to the injunction by posting an enforcement advisory stating it would not enforce the law “against covered entities for failing to post and submit reports by the January 1, 2026, statutory deadline.” For more details, see our blog post here.

On December 9, 2025, CARB published its first proposed regulations for California Senate Bills 261 (on climate-related risk reporting) and 253 (on greenhouse gas emissions reporting) and issued a Staff Report explaining their proposed approach. A 45-day comment period will open December 26, 2025 and end February 9, 2026. This will be followed by a public hearing on February 26, 2026 at 9 a.m. PT to consider approving the regulations.

On November 18, 2025, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance announced that it will not respond to most Rule 14a-8 no-action requests or express any views on companies’ intended reliance on any basis for excluding shareholder proposals under Rule 14a-8 for the 2025–2026 proxy season. For more details, see our client alert.

On December 3, 2025, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released a prepublication of its proposed new corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards for light-duty vehicles for model years 2022 through 2031. The proposal also includes several significant revisions to the CAFE program. For more details, see our client alert.

Taiwan aligns sustainable bond framework with global standards

From November 24, 2025, Taiwan’s sustainable bond regime fully incorporates blue and biodiversity bonds under its green bond framework, aligning with the 2025 ICMA Green Bond Principles. Eligible categories include marine conservation, biodiversity protection, water resource conservation, waste recycling or reuse, development of renewable energy and energy technology, and other climate change adaptation projects or projects approved by the Taipei Exchange (TPEx), with several successful issuances already in the market. TPEx is actively encouraging issuers to explore these instruments as demand for nature-linked financing grows ahead of COP30 in Brazil.

Hong Kong issues record HKD 10 billion multi-currency digital green bonds with tokenized central bank money

On November 11, 2025, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government announced that it successfully priced its third batch of digital green bonds (HKD, RMB, USD, and EUR) under the Government Sustainable Bond Program, raising around HKD 10 billion (~USD $1.28 million), marking the world’s largest digital bond offering to date and the first digital bond offering that integrates tokenized central bank money (e‑HKD and e‑CNY) as a settlement option. The four tranches were priced on November 10 as follows: HKD2.5 billion (2-year, 2.5%), RMB2.5 billion (5-year, 1.9%), USD $300 million (3-year, 3.633%), and EUR300 million (4-year, 2.512%). The subscriptions across four currency tranches exceeded HKD130 billion from a broad base of global institutional investors. Proceeds will be used to finance or refinance projects under the HKSAR Government’s Green Bond Framework, reinforcing Hong Kong’s strategy to scale green and sustainable finance and position itself as a leading digital assets hub.

Key ESG initiatives unveiled at Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Capital Markets Forum

On November 6, 2025, the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum (ACMF), a high-level grouping of capital markets regulators from 11 ASEAN jurisdictions, introduced several key ESG-related initiatives, including an updated version of the ASEAN Simplified ESG Disclosure Guide for Small and Medium Enterprises, which has been refined to provide guidance to SMEs in preparing ESG disclosures, a roadmap for the development of interoperable, high-integrity carbon credit markets in the region, and an updated version of the ASEAN Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, which serves as a reference point to guide capital and funding toward activities that help promote sustainability in the region.

The carrier plans a $500 million capital raise by early 2026 to expand its fleet and diversify operations.

Allan Kilavuka has stepped down as Chief Executive Officer of Kenya Airways. The airline appointed Captain George Kamal, its current Chief Operating Officer, as interim CEO to lead a transition period that will culminate in the appointment of a permanent successor. Management said Kilavuka took end-of-term leave ahead of the official expiration of his contract.

Kilavuka joined the helm of the national carrier in 2019 and led the airline through one of the most difficult periods in its history. During his tenure, Kenya Airways confronted the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and implemented cost-cutting measures and strategic initiatives aimed at preserving operational viability. This restructuring phase coincided with growth in revenue, passenger traffic and cargo volumes.

In 2024, the airline, which had long struggled with heavy debt and relied on support from the Kenyan state, returned to profitability for the first time in more than a decade. The company said a 10% increase in capacity supported a 4% rise in traffic, bringing total passengers carried during the year to 5.23 million.

George Kamal, who brings more than 29 years of leadership experience in the aviation sector across the Middle East and Africa, now takes charge in an environment still shaped by structural challenges. A key priority remains the return to sustainable financial balance. Despite the recovery recorded in 2024, Kenya Airways posted a pre-tax loss of 12.17 billion Kenyan shillings, or about $94.5 million, in the first half of 2025.

At the same time, the airline continues to pursue expansion and diversification. Management announced plans to raise $500 million by the first quarter of 2026 to strengthen the fleet, with the aim of increasing aircraft numbers from 34 to 53 over the next five years.

Investment enables SAF production for more sustainable future flying, diversifies Hawaii’s fuels industry, strengthens energy independence, and supports agriculture

HONOLULU, Dec. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines today announced it has joined Par Hawaii to invest in pioneering the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in Hawaiʻi using locally grown agriculture feedstock to reduce aviation carbon emissions.

This initiative will enable SAF production for more sustainable future flying and deliver economic benefits through the creation of a new energy sector and fuel supply chain in Hawai’i, while bringing new opportunities for local agriculture.

Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines, which together provide the most flights to, from and within Hawai’i, and Par Hawaii, the largest producer of energy products in the islands, are partnering with Pono Pacific, through its Pono Energy, Inc. subsidiary, to study Camelina sativa (camelina) as a multi-purpose crop that can be used as SAF feedstock and to support agriculture.

The combined airlines also will become Par Hawaii’s launch SAF customer, with plans to take delivery of Hawaiʻi’s first locally produced SAF in the first quarter of 2026.

SAF, a safe drop-in fuel made from sustainable feedstock such as plant-based oils or used cooking oil, can cut lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. Pono Pacific’s crop trials drew the attention of Alaska Star Ventures, the venture capital arm of Alaska Air Group that invests in technologies to drive aviation efficiency, performance and innovation.

“As Hawaiʻi’s airline, we have a responsibility to reduce our environmental impact while continuing to provide essential air service that connects our communities and strengthens our economy,” said Alanna James, sustainability innovation director at Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines. “Our company has a long-term strategy to reach net zero carbon emissions, and sustainable aviation fuel is essential for us to get there. We are grateful to have partners like Par Hawaii and Pono Pacific who share our commitment to making our operations more sustainable while creating a new fuel industry and strengthening Hawaiʻi’s energy independence.”

“We value the efforts of our airline partners as we work together to find long-term solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase our energy security, while meeting Hawai’i’s transportation needs,” said Ed Sniffen, director of the Hawai’i State Department of Transportation. “We applaud Hawaiian and Alaska airlines, Par Hawaii, and Pono Pacific for taking this important step to establish a locally based, lower-emissions supply chain for aviation fuel that supports our state’s clean energy goals.”

Pono Pacific, the state’s largest private resource company, will launch Pono Energy, Inc. in early 2026 to accelerate its work on camelina, a high-yield, pest-resistant cover crop that can be grown in rotation with food crops, reaching maturity in just eight to nine weeks. Its oil seeds can be crushed to produce renewable fuels, including SAF, while the remaining seedcake can be turned into government-approved, nutrient-rich feed for cattle and chickens. This revenue-generating cover crop will deliver more economic opportunity for Hawai’i by creating jobs, supporting farmers and decreasing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.

“Camelina represents a rare opportunity for Hawai’i to build a true circular-economy model around renewable fuels,” said Chris Bennett, Pono Pacific’s vice president of sustainable energy solutions.

“By growing this crop locally, we strengthen our agricultural sector, keep more dollars circulating within the state, and reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels. Camelina can be refined into sustainable aviation fuel while the remaining seedcake becomes a valuable, locally produced animal feed that supports Hawai’i’s ranchers and livestock industry. We will explore food crops that can be grown alongside camelina to increase food security as well. It’s a win for our economy, a win for local agriculture, and a win for the environment — an example of how Hawai’i can lead the way in innovative, homegrown climate solutions.”

Alaska Star Ventures has made a new investment that builds on Par Hawaii’s earlier support of Pono Pacific, which collaborated with the Hawaiʻi Agriculture Research Center to begin cultivating 50 non-GMO camelina varieties in 2023 to identify those best suited to Hawaiʻi’s year-round temperate climate.

The initial investment allowed Pono Pacific to conduct crop trials on four islands, in partnership with Aloun Farms, Mahi Pono and Meadow Gold Dairy. Pono Pacific identified suitable agricultural lands across the state and engaged Hawai’i’s cattle and livestock industry to explore the use of camelina seedcake as animal feed.

As Pono Pacific advances the agricultural foundation for camelina, Par Hawaii, the state largest fuels manufacturer, is preparing to deliver SAF in the first quarter of 2026. Earlier this year, Par Pacific, parent company of Par Hawaii, formed Hawai’i Renewables, and partnered with Alohi Renewable Energy, LLC, a joint venture between Mitsubishi Corporation and ENEOS Corporation, following a $100 million investment to convert and upgrade one of the refinery’s processing units into a renewable hydrotreater capable of processing plant-based and waste oils.

“In 2022, when we formed an agreement with Hawaiian Airlines to jointly study the commercial viability of locally produced sustainable aviation fuels, we didn’t think we would be able to progress so quickly,” said Par Hawaii President Eric Wright. “With renewable fuel production coming online in early 2026, it’s exciting to see the results of our team’s hard work. These fuels will have up to 80 percent lower carbon emissions compared to conventional fuels. This would not have been possible without a shared vision for our islands and our great teamwork.”

“We are thrilled to be the first customer to receive SAF from Par Hawaii next year,” added James. “This is an important milestone for our company and Hawai’i, but there is still more work to do. While SAF is the best option to reduce aviation emissions, it is two to three times more expensive than regular jet fuel and supply is limited. We will need strong collaboration across airlines, fuel and feedstock producers, investors, including business partners seeking to offset their scope 3 emissions, and government, along with supportive policies, to grow the SAF industry and reach our decarbonization goals.”

Represented on a line graph, fossil fuels evoke the lower jaw of a crocodile’s open mouth sinking downward, with economic growth represented by the upper jaw rising. Said differently, it’s another way to think about decoupling economic growth from fossil fuel use and emissions.

The “Crocodile Economy” has already taken form in 49 countries, mostly concentrated in Europe and Oceania, the region represented by Australia and surrounding nations, according to a study published last year in the journal Nature. In new research out last week, the nonprofit Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit estimates that countries representing 92 percent of the global economy have decoupled their emissions from economic growth in the 10 years since the Paris Climate Agreement.

Emerging economies will accelerate the pace of change by going directly to renewables as their energy needs grow, the business climate group Exponential Roadmap Initiative projects. “Emerging economies can skip carbon-intensive development altogether by leveraging today’s affordable clean technologies,” Katarina Wangler Björk, chief impact officer of Exponential Roadmap, and Owen Gaffney, co-founder of the climate-focused researcher coalition Future Earth Media Lab, wrote on the World Economic Forum.

“Even in the United States, energy-related CO2 emissions are ~20 percent lower than in 2005, while GDP has continued to rise,” Exponential Roadmap wrote in its October report, citing the U.S. government’s own data. Jonathan Watts of The Guardian added: “Donald Trump has tried to move the U.S. in the opposite direction, but his first term as president caused only a brief uptick in emissions. For most of the past two decades, U.S. emissions have been falling.”

Leading the pack in the U.S., the state of California demonstrates that decoupling emissions from growth is a matter of political will, not lack of technology. Due to the state’s longstanding pollution control efforts, California continues to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at rates faster than almost any other state while growing its economy.

“In California, we know that a healthy, clean climate and thriving economy aren’t zero-sum games. We can excel at both,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement this fall. The state cut greenhouse gas emissions by 21 percent since 2000 while its economy grew 81 percent,, according to the governor’s office.

Most sustainability investors commit to stepping up the pace

Regardless of federal energy policy, the U.S. financial sector is “already behaving as if a fossil fuel phase-out is underway,” Ingmar Rentzhog, CEO and founder of the influential climate action organization We Don’t Have Time, wrote in Forbes over the weekend.

“Not through headlines or pledges, but through mandates, risk models, and capital allocation decisions that quietly reroute money away from assets with declining transition credibility,” Retzhog wrote, citing a new Morgan Stanley survey of sustainability-oriented institutional investors.

The survey included more than 900 investors that practice sustainable investing, or plan to do so. “Regionally, more than 90 percent of North American asset owners surveyed said they expect to increase the proportion of their assets in sustainable strategies in the next two years, slightly ahead of investors in Europe (82 percent) and APAC (85 percent),” Morgan Stanley found.

While the Morgan Stanley report did not distinguish between Canadian and U.S. investors, other surveys indicate a strong commitment to sustainability by U.S. investors and businesses in particular. Pitchbook’s Sixth Annual Sustainable Investment Survey published this fall, for example, showed strong interest in sustainable investment practices among U.S. fund managers, investment consultants and other financial professionals.

.“Among respondents, 72 percent say they currently incorporate ESG factors into their investment evaluation and management process,” Anikka Sophia Villegas, senior analyst of fund strategies and sustainable investing at PitchBook, wrote of the research for Morningstar. “Just 5 percent indicated that they used to, but no longer do.”

While those who responded to the survey remain engaged in sustainable investing, Pitchbook saw the number of survey responses drop sharply this year as business leaders are reluctant to articulate ESG (environmental, social and governance) principles in public. Skittishness over the “ESG” acronym predates this year. Companies began responding to a growing surge in anti-ESG backlash during the Joe Biden administration, a trend that has intensified in 2025.

Over the summer, EcoVadis published the results of a survey of 400 executives representing U.S. companies with more than $1 billion in revenue. While fewer companies are talking openly about ESG, 87 percent of executives told EcoVadis they maintained or increased their sustainability investments this year. “Technology remained a key focus area for investment, according to the survey, with 89 percent of respondents planning further ESG tech investments over the next 12 months,” reported Mark Segal, founder of the news organization ESG Today.

The inevitable rise of the Crocodile Economy

President Donald Trump declared an “energy emergency” upon taking office with the intention of supporting oil, gas and coal producers in the U.S. However, the new White House policy also explicitly supports several forms of renewable energy. The president tapped hydropower and biomass for support in his emergency declaration on Jan. 20, and Energy Secretary Chris Wright added geothermal energy in his first Secretarial Order issued in February.

In addition, the Energy Department has continued to support the development of new, long-duration energy storage systems and new marine energy devices that harvest electricity from the movement of waves, tides and currents.

While none of these renewables offer the present-day scalability demonstrated by wind turbines and solar panels, all of them have the potential to help accelerate the renewable transition in the near future. In particular, the geothermal industry is already deploying new drilling technologies to extend into new, previously untapped regions of the U.S.

The biomass sector also shows signs of scaling as activity in the domestic SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) industry ramps up. “Momentum is building fast,” the leading domestic SAF producer XCF Global noted in November. “Under the U.S. SAF Grand Challenge, federal targets call for 3 billion gallons of annual production by 2030 — scaling to 35 billion gallons by 2050 to meet 100 percent of domestic demand.”

That may seem somewhat optimistic, considering that SAF only accounted for about 1 percent of the global supply of jet fuel last year. Nevertheless, XCF Global is planning to expand its existing 40 million gallons-per-year SAF facility in Nevada to approximately 80 million gallons. The company has also partnered with the bio-waste gasification specialist Southern Energy Renewables and the carbon management firm DevvStream to evaluate the potential for an SAF facility in Louisiana to produce about 40 million gallons per year.

XCF is just one example among many as more U.S. states, cities and businesses follow California’s lead and join other nations around the world in decoupling economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions.",https://triplepundit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/cropped-3P-Icon-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-17 15:57:16.994860

Reaching the original climate targets by the previously communicated very ambitious target years would have required significant investments that are currently not realistic. Neste continues to drive growth in renewable fuels, providing alternatives to fossil fuels to mitigate climate change.

Neste sets a carbon footprint target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in its own operations (Scope 1 & 2) by 80% by 2040, replacing the target of reaching carbon neutral production by 2035.

The timeline for the related interim target of 50% emission reduction is extended from 2030 to 2035.

With these changes Neste focuses solely on absolute emission reductions in its own operations and removes the option of using emission compensation from its climate target setting.

Two of Neste’s climate targets remain unchanged: the carbon footprint target to reduce the use-phase emission intensity of sold products by 50% by 2040, and the carbon handprint target to help customers reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 20 Mt annually by 2030. The respective reference years 2019 and 2020 have not been changed.

“The company's original targets to reduce its carbon footprint were based on a plan to transform Neste’s Porvoo refinery into a renewable and circular solutions refining hub by 2035. Since we announced the delay of Porvoo refinery transformation earlier this year, we have conducted a careful assessment of our climate targets to ensure they are ambitious but realistic,” said Neste’s CEO Heikki Malinen.

In the short term, Neste’s climate footprint mitigation actions focus on energy efficiency and operational excellence measures as well as evaluating alternatives to fossil hydrogen.

“Neste continues to provide its customers and consumers alternatives to fossil fuels, and our continuing investment in the world’s largest renewable fuels refinery in Rotterdam underlines our commitment to this,” added Malinen.",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Neste-revises-pic-Biofuel-17-12.png,N,,2025-12-17 13:57:16.023384

Investment enables SAF production for more sustainable future flying, diversifies Hawaii's fuels industry, strengthens energy independence, and supports agriculture

HONOLULU, Dec. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines today announced it has joined Par Hawaii to invest in pioneering the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in Hawaiʻi using locally grown agriculture feedstock to reduce aviation carbon emissions.

This initiative will enable SAF production for more sustainable future flying and deliver economic benefits through the creation of a new energy sector and fuel supply chain in Hawai'i, while bringing new opportunities for local agriculture.

Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines, which together provide the most flights to, from and within Hawai'i, and Par Hawaii, the largest producer of energy products in the islands, are partnering with Pono Pacific, through its Pono Energy, Inc. subsidiary, to study Camelina sativa (camelina) as a multi-purpose crop that can be used as SAF feedstock and to support agriculture.

The combined airlines also will become Par Hawaii's launch SAF customer, with plans to take delivery of Hawaiʻi's first locally produced SAF in the first quarter of 2026.

SAF, a safe drop-in fuel made from sustainable feedstock such as plant-based oils or used cooking oil, can cut lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. Pono Pacific's crop trials drew the attention of Alaska Star Ventures, the venture capital arm of Alaska Air Group that invests in technologies to drive aviation efficiency, performance and innovation.

""As Hawaiʻi's airline, we have a responsibility to reduce our environmental impact while continuing to provide essential air service that connects our communities and strengthens our economy,"" said Alanna James, sustainability innovation director at Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines. ""Our company has a long-term strategy to reach net zero carbon emissions, and sustainable aviation fuel is essential for us to get there. We are grateful to have partners like Par Hawaii and Pono Pacific who share our commitment to making our operations more sustainable while creating a new fuel industry and strengthening Hawaiʻi's energy independence.""

""We value the efforts of our airline partners as we work together to find long-term solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase our energy security, while meeting Hawai'i's transportation needs,"" said Ed Sniffen, director of the Hawai'i State Department of Transportation. ""We applaud Hawaiian and Alaska airlines, Par Hawaii, and Pono Pacific for taking this important step to establish a locally based, lower-emissions supply chain for aviation fuel that supports our state's clean energy goals.""

Pono Pacific, the state's largest private resource company, will launch Pono Energy, Inc. in early 2026 to accelerate its work on camelina, a high-yield, pest-resistant cover crop that can be grown in rotation with food crops, reaching maturity in just eight to nine weeks. Its oil seeds can be crushed to produce renewable fuels, including SAF, while the remaining seedcake can be turned into government-approved, nutrient-rich feed for cattle and chickens. This revenue-generating cover crop will deliver more economic opportunity for Hawai'i by creating jobs, supporting farmers and decreasing the aviation industry's carbon footprint.

""Camelina represents a rare opportunity for Hawai'i to build a true circular-economy model around renewable fuels,"" said Chris Bennett, Pono Pacific's vice president of sustainable energy solutions.

""By growing this crop locally, we strengthen our agricultural sector, keep more dollars circulating within the state, and reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels. Camelina can be refined into sustainable aviation fuel while the remaining seedcake becomes a valuable, locally produced animal feed that supports Hawai'i's ranchers and livestock industry. We will explore food crops that can be grown alongside camelina to increase food security as well. It's a win for our economy, a win for local agriculture, and a win for the environment — an example of how Hawai'i can lead the way in innovative, homegrown climate solutions.""

Alaska Star Ventures has made a new investment that builds on Par Hawaii's earlier support of Pono Pacific, which collaborated with the Hawaiʻi Agriculture Research Center to begin cultivating 50 non-GMO camelina varieties in 2023 to identify those best suited to Hawaiʻi's year-round temperate climate.

The initial investment allowed Pono Pacific to conduct crop trials on four islands, in partnership with Aloun Farms, Mahi Pono and Meadow Gold Dairy. Pono Pacific identified suitable agricultural lands across the state and engaged Hawai'i's cattle and livestock industry to explore the use of camelina seedcake as animal feed.

As Pono Pacific advances the agricultural foundation for camelina, Par Hawaii, the state largest fuels manufacturer, is preparing to deliver SAF in the first quarter of 2026. Earlier this year, Par Pacific, parent company of Par Hawaii, formed Hawai'i Renewables, and partnered with Alohi Renewable Energy, LLC, a joint venture between Mitsubishi Corporation and ENEOS Corporation, following a $100 million investment to convert and upgrade one of the refinery's processing units into a renewable hydrotreater capable of processing plant-based and waste oils.

""In 2022, when we formed an agreement with Hawaiian Airlines to jointly study the commercial viability of locally produced sustainable aviation fuels, we didn't think we would be able to progress so quickly,"" said Par Hawaii President Eric Wright. ""With renewable fuel production coming online in early 2026, it's exciting to see the results of our team's hard work. These fuels will have up to 80 percent lower carbon emissions compared to conventional fuels. This would not have been possible without a shared vision for our islands and our great teamwork.""

""We are thrilled to be the first customer to receive SAF from Par Hawaii next year,"" added James. ""This is an important milestone for our company and Hawai'i, but there is still more work to do. While SAF is the best option to reduce aviation emissions, it is two to three times more expensive than regular jet fuel and supply is limited. We will need strong collaboration across airlines, fuel and feedstock producers, investors, including business partners seeking to offset their scope 3 emissions, and government, along with supportive policies, to grow the SAF industry and reach our decarbonization goals.""

At the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, we know that understanding the atmosphere has never mattered more. As 2025 draws to a close, we’ve been looking back at our science stories from this year. This article highlights some of the contributions our community of staff have made towards atmospheric science.

January – Discovering disparity in England’s air pollution emissions

At the start of the year, we reported that minoritised ethnic groups, often living in urban centres or near major roads, face disproportionately high levels of harmful emissions of air pollutants.

Air quality researchers combined census data on socioeconomic deprivation and detailed information on population ethnicity at fine scales with air pollution emissions data in England. They identified that all 24 minoritised ethnic groups studied experienced higher than average air pollution emissions than socio-economically matched populations in the majority ‘White: English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British‘ ethnic group.

February – Identifying critical climate tipping points

In February, two teams set out to measure and model climate tippings points – where rapid and abrupt changes are irreversible on societal timescales.

Scientists are especially concerned about the rapid melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet and the collapse of the North Atlantic subpolar gyre. Both could lead to huge disruptions worldwide, such as drastic weather changes in Europe and rising sea levels globally.

The GAMB2LE project will build a pioneering automated and mobile polar observatory, which will focus on collecting continuous high-resolution data about the atmosphere-ice interface on the Greenland Ice Sheet.

The PROMOTE project will create a new generation of Earth System models to generate simulations of plausible tipping points, and provide recommendations for targeted observational networks. The models will be improved to better represent ice sheets and freshwater export from ice sheets into the ocean, as well as ocean eddies and mixing of water masses.

March – Understanding mountainous terrains to improve the accuracy of weather forecasts

Mountains have a big impact on local weather, regional weather patterns, and airflow in the lower and upper atmosphere.

In the spring, the NCAS-led part of the TEAMx programme set out to address the shortage of mountain weather data. Their focus over the year would be the Alps, a mountain range that stretches across 8 countries in Europe.

Joining an international team of 100+ fieldwork scientists, they began to develop and deploy bespoke research-grade instrumentation into the alpine environment – launching paired radiosondes, installing a new X-band weather radar on a mountain crest, and operating our research aircraft.

April – Integrating satellite and in-situ observations with model data

In April, we introduced VISION – a cutting-edge tool which is revolutionising atmospheric science by seamlessly integrating satellite and in-situ observations with model data, enabling researchers to create a digital twin of the FAAM Airborne Laboratory’s research aircraft, enhance model accuracy, and drive climate insights with unprecedented precision.

VISION will have real-world benefits both to the science produced by the FAAM Airborne Laboratory, but also to the carbon emissions and flight costs involved with collecting data.

May – UK’s first sustainable aviation fuel emissions “chase” experiment

In May, we investigated how pollutants from aircraft could be reduced by using sustainable aviation fuel.

Our FAAM Airborne Laboratory’s atmospheric research aircraft “chased” Cranfield University’s National Flying Laboratory Centre research aircraft to measure the emissions it produces during flight. With one trailing the other to sample its emissions, the scientists were able to compare the pollutants produced by sustainable aviation fuel and traditional jet fuel. This is a major step forward in understanding how different aviation fuels change the impact of flying on air quality and the climate.

June – Weather and climate forecasting for renewable energy

This summer we highlighted how researchers are using weather and climate forecasting to help renewable energy in East Africa.

As East Africa transitions toward a low-carbon future, renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydropower are playing an increasingly critical role in national development strategies. These sources of energy are inherently weather-dependent, making power systems vulnerable to climate variability, low winds, increased cloud cover, and droughts.

A new collaborative research initiative, known as POWER-Kenya, is investigating how sub-seasonal weather forecasts (typically 2 to 4 weeks ahead) can inform Kenya’s strategy for a resilient renewable energy supply.

July – From clean air to a warming planet

In July, a new international study, co-authored by the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, found that recent monumental efforts to reduce air pollution in East Asia may have inadvertently contributed to a noticeable acceleration in global warming since 2010.

For decades, air pollution – particularly sulfate aerosols from burning fossil fuels – has helped cool the Earth’s surface by reflecting sunlight back into space. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated in 2021 that aerosols had a net cooling effect of about 0.4°C globally.

But, starting in the early 2010s, East Asia began implementing strict air quality policies that are vital for human health. China, where air pollution is responsible for approximately one million premature deaths each year, has led the change. These efforts have resulted in a dramatic 75% reduction in sulphur dioxide emissions over the past 15 years.

The relatively quick clean-up of air pollution in East Asia, although it reduces the cooling mask, is both necessary and long overdue to protect human health. And as aerosol levels stabilise, the pace of warming is expected to return to the longer-term trend driven by greenhouse gases.

August – Low emission hydrogen engines could cut air pollution from construction

In August, we reported on a promising innovation that could offer a practical and impactful route to reducing air pollution from the construction industry, and improving air quality in cities.

The hydrogen internal combustion engine, also known as H2ICE, can be used in heavy-duty and off-grid environments. Emissions of nitrogen oxides from a 4-cylinder 55kW spark ignition hydrogen engine using lean-burn combustion were found to be 40 – 500 times lower than those from state-of-the-art diesel engines.

H2ICE may be particularly beneficial for densely populated urban areas and major infrastructure sites where air quality effects are considered as part of planning approvals.

September – Forecasting monsoon rainfall in a changing climate

At the end of summer and prompted by the disastrous monsoon season in South Asia, we highlighted how researchers are using forecast-based attribution to provide insights into how climate change may have influenced rainfall patterns over Pakistan.

Three years ago, Pakistan experienced devastating floods caused by abnormally heavy monsoon rainfall from June to August. The 2022 disaster affected millions of people, left thousands homeless, and tragically claimed more than 1,500 lives. Over two million acres of crops were destroyed, and more than 700,000 livestock were lost, creating long-lasting humanitarian and economic impacts.

Months before the floods began, seasonal forecasts from several weather models had indicated a heightened risk of unusually heavy rainfall across Pakistan. This raised the possibility of using forecasts not just to predict events, but also to assess the impact of climate change on them.

The results of the forecast-based attribution were not straightforward, but they show that climate change is one piece of the puzzle.

October – Weather radar reveal patterns in UK insect populations

In the autumn, an insect monitoring study using weather radar data was in the spotlight. Traditionally used to track rainfall and storms, weather radar have been used to help researchers monitor the daily movements and long-term abundance of flying and floating insects.

Despite growing concern about insect declines due to climate change, land use, and light pollution, it’s been difficult to track large-scale trends – until now.

The team repurposed data from the UK’s network of weather surveillance radars. By measuring how radar signals bounce off airborne objects and using dual-polarisation technology to tell insects apart from raindrops, the scientists were able to estimate the number of insects flying between 500 and 700 metres above ground.

Their results show an average of 11.2 trillion insects in the air during daytime hours and just over 5 trillion at night during the main flying seasons. Insect abundance was higher in areas with woodlands, grasslands, and even urban areas – but dropped in intensively farmed regions and where artificial lighting was high. And while daytime insect numbers remain relatively stable or even increased in southern regions, the researchers found that nighttime-airborne insects have declined overall – especially in the far north.

November – Major drop in sulfur emissions from ships

In November, we confirmed that recent global regulations have significantly reduced sulfur emissions from ships, helping to improve air quality in coastal regions.

Using aircraft-based measurements for the first time, alongside ground-based instruments, the research team measured sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emitted by ships in the North-East Atlantic and European coastal waters.

The team found that the average sulfur content in ship fuel dropped nearly tenfold in open ocean areas following the International Maritime Organization’s 2020 regulation.

December – High levels of air pollution in homes

At the end of the year, we shared an important study that discovered harmful levels of indoor air pollution in homes, during one of the largest and most detailed indoor air quality investigations to take place in the UK – led by the INGENIOUS project team.

High concentrations of fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, were found in some of the homes of 309 families participating in the long-term Born in Bradford health study – with recommended World Health Organisation guidelines exceeded on 41% of all monitored days. Families from deprived areas and ethnic minority backgrounds were found to be facing the highest levels of exposure.

Atmospheric Science in 2026

As 2025 comes to an end, we’re looking forward to 2026 and continuing our research to understand our atmosphere, how it is changing, and how it impacts our global environment, our health, and our prosperity.

While electrification and hydrogen-powered aircraft are long-term possibilities, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) offers an immediate and scalable solution that can be used in existing aircraft engines and airport infrastructure. However, SAF production is still limited, and the industry needs more, and increasingly sustainable, solutions to further decarbonise the aviation.

Fjord PtX addresses this challenge by producing eSAF through a locally integrated system that couples renewable energy, carbon capture and district heating. Located in Aalborg, the project builds on strong municipal partnerships to create a circular and integrated energy system. The CO₂ will be sourced from Nordværk’s waste-to-energy operations, turning local emissions into a valuable feedstock.

Aalborg Forsyning, Aalborg Municipality’s utility company, will provide both land and technical water, in turn receiving surplus heat from the plant, feeding directly into the district heating network. This level of sector coupling, linking waste, energy, heating and transport, is essential to making SAF production both sustainable and scalable.

By 2030, Fjord PtX will produce up to 90,000 tonnes of eSAF annually, enough to cover either approx. 15% of the projected European demand for eSAF or unlock Danish ambitions of fully renewable domestic aviation. The production will utilize up to 330,000 tonnes of CO2 annually and is expected to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 90%, compared to fossil jet fuel. The project will support European and Danish climate ambitions, while also creating local jobs.

The score places ATR at the “management” level, indicating established governance, risk management, and performance tracking related to climate impacts.

CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, is widely regarded as a benchmark for corporate climate disclosure. Its annual assessments evaluate the quality and completeness of companies’ climate data, how organizations manage climate-related risks and opportunities, and whether decarbonization strategies are aligned with long-term global climate goals. A “B” score signals that a company has moved beyond basic disclosure and is implementing coordinated, organization-wide actions to reduce environmental impact.

Consistency in Climate Governance

Maintaining a CDP “B” score over multiple years is notable in an aviation sector facing increasing scrutiny over emissions, fuel use, and lifecycle impacts. ATR’s repeated performance suggests continuity in governance structures, internal accountability, and long-term planning rather than one-off improvements tied to a single reporting cycle.

The company’s approach centers on annual environmental disclosure to CDP, which enables year-over-year tracking of emissions performance and climate-related risks. This consistency supports comparability for investors, customers, and regulators seeking insight into how aircraft manufacturers are responding to tightening climate expectations.

SBTi-Validated Decarbonization Targets

A key driver behind ATR’s CDP performance is its decarbonization pathway, validated in 2023 by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The pathway aligns with the Paris Agreement and reflects ATR’s stated ambition to contribute to net-zero aviation by 2050.

ATR’s targets include:

A 50.4% reduction in absolute greenhouse gas emissions from operations and energy use (Scopes 1 and 2) by 2030

A 30% reduction in absolute greenhouse gas emissions from its in-service aircraft fleet (Scope 3, use of sold products) by 2030

Both targets use 2018 as the baseline year, placing emphasis on absolute reductions rather than intensity-only improvements.

Aircraft Efficiency and SAF Deployment

Beyond target setting, ATR continues to focus on improving aircraft efficiency, positioning its turboprop aircraft as among the lowest-emission options in the regional aviation market. Turboprops typically consume less fuel on short-haul routes compared to regional jets, making efficiency gains particularly relevant as airlines face rising fuel costs and carbon constraints.

The OEM is also supporting the deployment of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which remains one of the primary near-term levers for reducing aviation emissions. While SAF availability and cost remain challenges globally, aircraft compatibility and manufacturer support are considered essential to scaling adoption.

Transparency as a Strategic Signal

In a statement accompanying the CDP score, the company emphasized the role of disclosure in driving accountability and progress. “By disclosing our environmental data annually to CDP, we reaffirm our commitment to transparency, accountability and continuous progress in limiting the environmental and climate-related impact of our activities,” the press release stated. It added that the score “highlights the strength and reliability of our strategy and reinforces our determination to support customers in transitioning toward lower-emission operations worldwide.”",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251216-135216-5ac-ATR%2072-500%20MSN%20703%20in%2040%20years%20of%20making%20a%20difference%20livery%20%20run-up%20point%20at%20Francazal%20airport.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 11:58:04.370970

Electrolytic hydrogen production remains expensive, with costs significantly higher than early estimates.

Build back industrial decarbonisation funding, including hydrogen funding streams, and ensure timely delivery of public funds that minimise regional competition.","The UK has long been regarded as a climate leader and has achieved clear progress to back it up. It has cut its greenhouse gas emissions by more than 50 percent since 1990 and was the first major economy to legislate for net zero and set legally binding carbon budgets.

Part of this attempt has been its leadership on hydrogen. Since releasing its low-carbon hydrogen strategy in 2021, the UK has taken meaningful steps to build out a hydrogen economy, including setting time-bound production targets, formulating a pragmatic low-carbon hydrogen standard (LCHS) for accounting emissions reductions, and establishing its Hydrogen Production Business Model. It has also created critical funding streams like the Hydrogen Allocation Rounds (HAR) and Cluster Sequencing processes, which support the development of hydrogen projects within carbon capture and storage (CCS) networks.

With a Hydrogen Strategy update expected imminently, this is a timely opportunity to reflect on what the UK has got right and where there are opportunities for course correction to ensure hydrogen is deployed in the sectors that need the clean molecule most.

These questions were central to the CATF-E3G event held earlier this month in London, which examined how and where the UK should deploy clean hydrogen to best decarbonise its economy as part of a pragmatic decarbonisation portfolio. Below are some key takeaways from that discussion.

Hydrogen will play a critical but not extensive role in UK decarbonisation

While it is too early to define every end use, low-carbon hydrogen will be most critical for industry and long-distance transport. The clearest cases for hydrogen in the UK are in energy-intensive industries, such as chemicals and fuels production, that cannot decarbonise without a clean molecule, and which can also take advantage of shared industry cluster infrastructure. Hydrogen-derived fuels will be required for the UK’s aviation and maritime sectors, with demand expected to grow into the 2040s.

Electrification, however, should remain the default decarbonisation choice, with hydrogen reserved for applications that are genuinely hard-to-electrify or the only option available. The UK government, therefore, must consider how its hydrogen strategy is more closely integrated into broader industrial decarbonisation and electrification endeavours.

Some hydrogen transport and storage (T&S) may be needed at the national level, but the location, scale, and function of such infrastructure require further assessment. For example, long-distance hydrogen transport through the gas network is becoming increasingly unrealistic and lacks strategic purpose, and T&S will be more beneficial when deployed around critical demand centres.

Addressing misalignment across national hydrogen policy and funding is critical

Despite early leadership on low-carbon hydrogen, inconsistent policy frameworks and delayed implementation are now creating barriers to investment and deployment.

Funding frameworks across hydrogen-related schemes are misaligned in approach. Some allow developers to apply for funds from multiple schemes whereas others restrict support to just one pot. For example, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) and Department for Transport (DfT) each have their own hydrogen-derived fuels schemes and a producer supported under the DESNZ scheme is not eligible for support under the DfT scheme.

Frameworks also apply regional competition inconsistently. The cluster sequencing and infrastructure allocations require regions to compete for funding, whereas HAR does not. The UK Government should instead plan decarbonisation strategically at the national level, prioritising infrastructure in the most critical locations. NESO’s Strategic Spatial Energy Plan due in 2027 should support this approach. This will mean making difficult but necessary decisions to ensure best value of public funds and enable projects to move from planning to operation.

Furthermore, hydrogen standards cross-government are not fully aligned. A clear standout is the DfT Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandate, which does not align with DESNZ hydrogen rules as CCS-enabled hydrogen is currently ineligible as a feedstock for aviation fuels production limiting domestic feedstock production potential.

These policy inconsistences across government departments and quasi-government bodies like the National Energy System Operator (NESO) undermine business cases and delay investment decisions in first-of-a-kind hydrogen projects. And this is not just applicable to hydrogen, as cross-governmental policy coordination and support on industrial decarbonisation is also needed.

The planning and governance process would also benefit from broader stakeholder representation, particularly NGO perspectives and those of public interest. NGO perspectives would be particularly welcome under initiatives such as the Hydrogen Delivery Council, where viewpoints are limited to only government and industry, which may lead to unrealistic decisions/outcomes.

The UK has been a frontrunner on hydrogen, but it must follow through on commitments

The UK’s twin-track approach to electrolytic and CCS-enabled hydrogen production has enabled effective optionality for project developers, supported by dedicated funding streams for each pathway. However, the transition from planning to real-world progress has been slower than anticipated.

Electrolytic hydrogen production remains expensive, with costs significantly higher than early estimates. Early projects have faced high costs, and a clear pathway to economies of scale is needed to help bring costs down. Policy is also needed to tackle high energy prices faced by industry.

Delays to awarding HAR 2 projects have reduced investor confidence and slowed the speed of deployment, yet the existing policy framework does not reflect these realities. The private sector cannot price policy uncertainty on its own, and a widening “valley of death” that developers face now threatens the viability of the next wave of projects.

Without action, decarbonisation risks turning into deindustrialisation

Slow government support has already had consequences. The shutdown of the UK ammonia industry and the need for last-minute intervention to prevent Tata Steel’s exit from the domestic market illustrate how delays and uncertainty have real world consequences for energy-intensive industries. Whether these industries remain in the UK is closely linked to the pace and clarity of decarbonisation policy and availability of public support mechanisms, including hydrogen.

A path forward for the UK’s hydrogen strategy

To get hydrogen efforts back on track, the UK should:

Update its national hydrogen strategy to better reflect sectoral demand and interlink more clearly with industrial decarbonisation priorities.

Align and coordinate low-carbon hydrogen and fuels policy across Government bodies to ensure uniform and fair application.

Bring more holistic voices into decision-making processes for more pragmatic planning.

Build back industrial decarbonisation funding, including hydrogen funding streams, and ensure timely delivery of public funds that minimise regional competition.

Hydrogen can be an important part of the UK’s net zero transition, but only if deployed where it is most needed and underpinned by a coherent, predictable, and coordinated policy environment. The upcoming national strategy update offers a key opportunity for the UK to reaffirm its leadership and build a hydrogen sector that strengthens both climate ambition and industrial competitiveness.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/04065528/UK-AERIAL-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 10:56:48.154402

The proposed collaboration aims to boost the availability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the US, expand production capacity, and incorporate environmental-attribute monetisation into a single customer solution.

The companies will evaluate the feasibility of building a “Gen 1” SAF facility in Louisiana using hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA). This would complement Southern Energy Renewables’ previously announced biomass-based “Gen 2” SAF gasification plant.

This evaluation is part of ongoing negotiations towards a binding agreement that could see the creation of a commercial platform allowing customers to access fuel, logistics, and environmental attributes through one integrated offering.

DevvStream chairman Carl Stanton said: “Integrating environmental assets directly into the fuel value chain is essential to accelerating SAF deployment.

“This collaboration has the potential to bring together three distinct strengths – XCF’s production expertise, Southern’s developing advanced biomass platform, and DevvStream’s environmental-asset monetisation capabilities – to help improve project economics while giving airlines confidence in the integrity of their SAF purchases.”

According to the parties, the US market for SAF is projected to reach nearly $7bn by the end of this decade, with global demand forecasted to surpass 5.5 billion gallons and a total market value exceeding $25bn.

Projections for 2050 suggest the global SAF market could surpass $250bn.

The collaboration is intended to support this expected sector growth by increasing long-term supply across various production pathways and advancing the commercialisation and transparency of environmental attributes.

Environmental-attribute integration is expected to play a significant role in the potential collaboration. DevvStream is anticipated to oversee the creation, validation, and commercialisation of environmental assets tied to the platform’s potential low-carbon fuels.

These assets may include compliance and voluntary carbon credits, CORSIA units, renewable energy certificates, digital measurement, reporting, verification (MRV) tools, and tokenised tracking systems.

The companies also intend to jointly assess solutions for helping customers capture, verify, and monetise attributes such as low-carbon fuel standard (LCFS) credits, renewable identification numbers (RINs), and incentives under regulations such as 45Z/45Q.

Further evaluation will cover lifecycle analysis methodologies and carbon-intensity optimisation systems designed to improve project economics and uphold standards in SAF development.

Southern Energy Renewables CEO Jay Patel said: “We believe partnering with XCF and DevvStream would strengthen our ability to scale a multi-pathway SAF strategy grounded in real production capacity and real climate benefit.”

According to statements from the three companies, the MoU indicates an intention to pursue opportunities in sustainable aviation fuel and related low-carbon fuels.

The europe aircraft MRO market size was valued at USD 21.29 billion in 2024 and is anticipated to reach USD 22.34 billion in 2025 from USD 33.92 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 5.36% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2033.

Aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) is a critical backbone of the continent’s aviation ecosystem ensuring airworthiness operational continuity and regulatory compliance across commercial business and defense fleets. Unlike transactional service sectors aircraft MRO is governed by stringent oversight from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency which mandates recurring inspections component replacements and airframe checks based on flight hours and calendar intervals. According to Eurocontrol, European airlines operated a combined fleet exceeding 3,200 commercial aircraft in 2024, which is reflecting a 12% increase from pre‑pandemic levels and amplifying scheduled maintenance demand. Furthermore, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) reports that the average age of narrow‑body aircraft in Western Europe reached 11.4 years in 2024, elevating the need for structural inspections and system retrofits. The region hosts over 180 EASA Part 145 certified MRO facilities, with major hubs in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Spain, leveraging engineering expertise and OEM partnerships. Beyond commercial aviation, Europe’s defense sector maintains over 1,600 fixed‑wing military aircraft, as documented by the European Defence Agency (EDA), necessitating specialized depot‑level maintenance. This intricate interplay of regulatory rigor, fleet dynamics, and technological evolution defines the contemporary European aircraft MRO landscape, as it adapts to sustainability mandates and digital transformation.

MARKET DRIVERS

Aging Commercial Fleet Intensifies Structural and System Overhaul Requirements

The progressive aging of Europe’s commercial aircraft fleet has emerged as a primary driver of MRO demand due to mandatory airframe inspections component fatigue assessments and avionics modernization cycles, which is majorly driving the European aircraft MRO market growth. As per IATA (2024), the average age of narrow body aircraft operated by European carriers reached 11.4 years while wide body fleets averaged 13.7 years, which is signalling entry into high maintenance phases. Aircraft exceeding 10 years require comprehensive D checks every 6–10 years involving complete disassembly corrosion treatment and structural reinforcement. Lufthansa Technik reported conducting 42 heavy maintenance checks in 2023 alone on Airbus A320ceo and Boeing 737 Classic variants all exceeding 12 years of service. According to EASA, repetitive eddy current inspections on wing spars and fuselage lap joints are mandated after 30,000 flight cycles, a threshold increasingly met by legacy fleets. Replacement of obsolete components such as hydraulic actuators and analogue flight displays further compounds workload. As per Cirium (2024), 68% of European narrow bodies are projected to surpass the 12-year mark by 2027. This demographic pressure ensures sustained demand for deep maintenance regardless of short-term traffic fluctuations.

Regulatory Mandates for Avionics Modernization and Emissions Compliance Accelerate Retrofit Demand

European aviation authorities have enacted progressive regulatory frameworks compelling airlines to upgrade aircraft systems for safety communication and environmental performance, thereby fuelling MRO activity and the regional market expansion. According to the European Commission, all aircraft operating in EU airspace must be equipped with Performance Based Navigation and Controller Pilot Data Link Communication capabilities by 2026. This mandate has triggered a wave of avionics retrofits with over 1,400 European registered aircraft undergoing cockpit upgrades in 2023 as per Eurocontrol. Simultaneously the EU Emissions Trading System now fully integrates aviation requiring precise fuel monitoring and data reporting which necessitates installation of advanced fuel flow sensors and flight data recorders. Airbus estimates that 75% of its in service A320 fleet in Europe requires supplemental data acquisition units to comply. Additionally, noise abatement regulations around major airports such as Heathrow and Frankfurt enforce Stage IV noise compliance pushing operators to retrofit hush kits or replace engines. Rolls Royce reported servicing 210 Trent 700 engines in 2024 for noise and emissions enhancements under these rules. These overlapping regulatory imperatives transform MRO from reactive upkeep into a strategic compliance function.

MARKET RESTRAINTS

Persistent Shortage of Certified Aviation Technicians Constrains Capacity Utilization

The Europe aircraft MRO market faces a critical workforce bottleneck due to an acute shortage of licensed aviation maintenance engineers which directly limits shop capacity and turnaround efficiency. According to EASA, over 12,000 new technician certifications are needed annually across the EU to meet current demand yet training institutions produce fewer than 8,000 qualified graduates each year. This gap has widened since 2022 as experienced personnel retired in record numbers with the German Aerospace Industries Association estimating that 35% of its maintenance workforce is over 55 years old. Airlines such as Air France and easyJet have reported MRO slot delays of up to 21 days in 2024 due to staffing shortages at third party facilities. The issue is exacerbated by uneven geographic distribution with Eastern European MRO centers lacking sufficient certified personnel despite available infrastructure. EASA’s strict certification requirements under Part 66 prohibit task delegation to non-licensed personnel for critical inspections further tightening bottlenecks. While virtual reality training and modular certification programs are emerging, the pipeline remains insufficient to support projected fleet growth. This human capital deficit represents a structural ceiling on MRO throughput regardless of capital investment.

Volatility in Aircraft on Ground Periods Disrupts Maintenance Scheduling and Resource Allocation

Unpredictable aircraft utilization patterns driven by operational disruptions and ad hoc route changes have significantly destabilized MRO planning across Europe, which is further impeding the regional market growth. According to the European Cockpit Association (2024), over 28% of short haul flights experienced last minute cancellations or aircraft swaps due to crew shortages and air traffic control constraints. Such volatility forces airlines to defer scheduled maintenance leading to compressed heavy check windows and cascading delays. Lufthansa Technik disclosed that 17% of its planned C checks in Q1 2024 were rescheduled due to unplanned aircraft grounding from technical faults or crew unavailability. This unpredictability complicates inventory management for rotable components and reduces workforce productivity as technicians shift between tasks. Moreover, MRO contracts increasingly include strict turnaround time penalties with non-compliance fees averaging €45,000 per delayed day as per Oliver Wyman industry benchmarks. Facilities operating at 90% capacity cannot absorb these shocks without overtime or subcontracting both of which inflate costs. Until airlines achieve stable flying schedules through improved crew planning and airspace modernization MRO providers will contend with inefficient resource deployment.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

Expansion of Digital Twin and Predictive Maintenance Platforms Creates High Value Service Offerings

The integration of digital twin technology and data driven predictive maintenance is unlocking new revenue streams and operational efficiencies for European aircraft MRO market. By creating virtual replicas of aircraft systems fed by real time sensor data from engines APUs and landing gear MRO firms can forecast component failures before they occur. As per Airbus (2024), nearly 900 of its aircraft in European service now transmit live health data through the Skywise platform enabling predictive interventions. Lufthansa Technik’s AVIATAR system processed over 2.3 billion data points in 2024 to optimize component life and reduce unscheduled removals by 18%. This shift from fixed interval to condition-based maintenance extends asset life and minimizes aircraft on ground time. European regulators including EASA have endorsed these models by updating maintenance approval procedures to accept data driven deferrals. Furthermore, digital twins facilitate virtual troubleshooting allowing engineers to simulate repairs before physical work begins cutting workshop time by up to 30% as demonstrated in trials by Satair. Airlines such as Finnair have signed multi-year digital MRO contracts valuing data analytics on par with traditional labor. This transformation positions MRO providers as integrated data partners rather than reactive service vendors.

Growth in Sustainable Aviation Fuel Compatibility Testing Drives Specialized Engine MRO Demand

The accelerating adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel across Europe is generating novel MRO requirements centred on engine compatibility certification and material degradation analysis, which is another promising opportunity for the European aircraft MRO market. The European Commission mandates that 6% of all aviation fuel supplied in the EU must be sustainable by 2030 under the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative. Airlines are blending up to 50% SAF in current operations. However, prolonged exposure to certain bio derived fuel components can accelerate seal wear and deposit formation in high pressure turbine sections. Rolls Royce has conducted over 200 engine teardowns since 2022 specifically to assess SAF induced wear with findings integrated into revised maintenance protocols. In 2024 Safran and Air France launched a joint program to monitor CFM56 engines on SAF rich routes with enhanced borescope inspections every 500 flight hours. EASA has issued new service bulletins requiring fuel system material verification for aircraft operating above 30% SAF blends. This regulatory and operational shift compels MRO providers to develop specialized inspection checklists trained personnel and material compatibility databases. As SAF usage expands from niche demonstrations to mainstream operations these tailored engine MRO services will become standard across European maintenance networks.

MARKET CHALLENGES

Fragmented Regulatory Oversight Across Non-EU European States Complicates Cross Border MRO Certification

The absence of harmonized aviation maintenance regulations in non-EU European countries creates significant compliance complexity for pan regional MRO providers, which is a major challenge to the European market growth. While EASA Part 145 certification is recognized across the European Union nations such as Serbia Ukraine and Moldova maintain independent airworthiness authorities with divergent approval processes. According to the European Business Aviation Association, operators in the Western Balkans face an average of 45 additional days to validate MRO work performed in EU facilities due to bilateral agreement delays. This fragmentation forces MRO companies to maintain duplicate documentation systems and pursue country specific approvals inflating administrative costs by an estimated 12% as reported by the European Regions Airline Association. Moreover, components repaired in an EASA certified shop may require re inspection before installation on aircraft registered in non-aligned states disrupting just in time logistics. During the 2024 Balkan airspace recovery following regional disruptions several carriers reported aircraft grounded for over 3 weeks awaiting paperwork validation. Until the European Common Aviation Area fully integrates oversight standards this jurisdictional patchwork will impede seamless MRO service delivery across the continent.

Rising Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities in Connected MRO Ecosystems Threaten Operational Integrity

The digitalization of aircraft maintenance systems has introduced significant cybersecurity risks that threaten data integrity workshop safety and regulatory compliance across Europe, which is further challenging the aircraft MRO market growth in Europe. Modern MRO operations rely on interconnected platforms for technical logbooks component tracking and remote diagnostics yet 63% of European MRO providers reported at least one cyber incident in 2024 according to ENISA. Attack vectors include compromised electronic flight bags falsified service records and malware injected through third party software updates. In one 2023 case a major European MRO facility had to suspend all work for 72 hours after ransomware encrypted its component traceability database delaying over 30 aircraft releases. EASA has since issued cybersecurity guidelines for maintenance organizations but implementation remains voluntary and uneven. The integration of OEM proprietary systems such as Boeing’s AnalytX and Airbus’s Airspace further fragments security protocols. Without standardized encryption access controls and incident response frameworks the industry remains exposed to disruptions that could cascade through the aviation supply chain. This emerging threat dimension necessitates dedicated cyber resilience investments beyond traditional workshop safety paradigms.

Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty welcomed the pace of bilateral engagement during a telephone call with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, noting that sustained political coordination has created a framework for deeper economic and investment cooperation between the two countries.

According to Foreign Ministry spokesman Tamim Khallaf, Abdelatty said Egypt is seeking to convene the fifth round of the ministerial-level Strategic Dialogue and the joint committee meeting to advance cooperation across multiple domains, as both sides prepare to mark 70 years of diplomatic relations next year.

The foreign minister pointed to the role of Chinese companies in major infrastructure projects in Egypt, including the Light Rail Transit project and the Central Business District in the New Administrative Capital. These projects are seen as strengthening urban transport capacity, connectivity and logistics efficiency, alongside cooperation in renewable energy and desalination.

Ain Sokhna’s logistics positioning has also been reinforced by recent developments at the port, where Deputy Prime Minister for Industrial Development and Minister of Industry and Transport Kamel El-Wazir received a Guinness World Records certificate recognising Ain Sokhna as the deepest man-made port basin constructed on land, with a depth of 19 metres. The port’s development forms part of a national plan to enhance Egypt’s role in international trade and position Sokhna as a logistics and transit hub on the Red Sea, supporting large vessels, higher cargo volumes and port-centric supply chains.

The logistics role of Ain Sokhna has also been expanded through new industrial investments linked directly to port operations. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Dr Mostafa Madbouly witnessed the signing of a contract for a sustainable aviation fuel production project by Qatari Al-Mana Holding Company in the Sokhna Integrated Zone of the Suez Canal Economic Zone. The project marks the first Qatari industrial investment within the Suez Canal economy and involves the establishment of SAf Fly Limited, a dedicated production entity located across both the industrial zone and the port area, integrating manufacturing and maritime logistics functions.

With an investment of $200 million, the project is being developed on a total area of 100,000 square metres, including 30,000 square metres inside Ain Sokhna port, enabling direct access to export infrastructure. The facility is designed to produce 200,000 tonnes annually of sustainable aviation fuel, bio-propane and bio-naphtha, derived from used edible oils. Al-Mana Holding has signed a long-term supply agreement with Shell to purchase the full output, with fuel deliveries scheduled to begin by the end of 2027, reinforcing Sokhna’s role in global energy and aviation fuel supply chains.

Abdelatty also highlighted investment opportunities linked to Egypt’s strategy to localise industry and transfer technology, with an emphasis on attracting Chinese investment in artificial intelligence and digitalisation, areas that support modern logistics, industrial automation and supply chain management.

The discussions come as Egypt continues to position economic zones and transport corridors as platforms for foreign investment tied to manufacturing, logistics and trade flows, supported by large-scale infrastructure development.

The cooperation has been formalised through a memorandum of understanding and aims to support the market entry of solar-based synthetic fuels developed by Swiss clean energy company Synhelion, reports STAT Trade Times.

A key element of the agreement is a long-term commitment to purchase sustainable aviation fuel, which is expected to give Synhelion the certainty needed to move its technology to industrial-scale production. Synhelion produces renewable synthetic fuels by using solar energy to create liquid hydrocarbons, including solar jet fuel, which can significantly cut emissions over their life cycle without requiring changes to existing aircraft or airport infrastructure.

Under the arrangement, Kuehne+Nagel, SWISS and Swiss WorldCargo will work together to support the adoption of Synhelion’s fuel. By signalling reliable demand, the partners aim to help attract further investment and enable production to scale up. From 2027, Kuehne+Nagel plans to buy Synhelion’s sustainable aviation fuel from SWISS for a period of five years and apply it to its air cargo shipments transported by Swiss WorldCargo. This will support Kuehne+Nagel’s wider efforts to reduce emissions and allow customers to lower the carbon footprint of their air freight.

Kuehne+Nagel said expanding the supply of synthetic sustainable aviation fuel is essential for the aviation sector to meet its climate goals, and partnerships such as this are needed to bring new technologies to commercial viability. The company added that the agreement will help customers take part in reducing emissions through the use of alternative fuels.

SWISS said cooperation across the industry is crucial to address the limited availability and high cost of sustainable aviation fuel. The airline noted that working with logistics partners on long-term fuel purchases is an important step toward making cleaner fuels more widely available and supporting the first commercial use of Synhelion’s product.

The partnership highlights a broader trend in the aviation and logistics sectors, where long-term fuel purchase agreements are increasingly being used to reduce risks for new technologies and help move them from pilot projects to full commercial deployment.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-17.png,N,,2025-12-17 09:59:12.153971

Aviation accounts for around 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions. In addition to CO₂, flying generates other emissions that can contribute to global warming, especially at high altitudes.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is an alternative to fossil kerosene that potentially helps reduce the industry’s reliance on fossil fuels. Produced from non-fossil resources, such as used cooking oil, SAF has a significantly lower carbon impact than fossil-based kerosene when assessed over its entire life cycle.

During combustion, SAF emits similar CO₂ levels as fossil jet fuel. However, while fossil fuels add to the overall level of CO₂ in the atmosphere by releasing carbon that has been locked underground for millions of years, SAF recycles CO₂ that was absorbed during the growth of the biomass used in its feedstock.

Although SAF is a positive step forward, its use in aviation remains limited due to high costs and low availability. As a result, its current impact on the aviation sector’s carbon footprint is still modest. That is why scaling up the use and production of SAF is a shared goal for everyone working to reduce aviation’s dependency on fossil fuels.

Contribute to SAF while booking your flights

When booking your next flight on our website or through the app, you have the possibility to contribute to SAF. The contribution amount is €3–15 per passenger per direction. It's predefined and based on the travel class and the length of the Finnair-operated flights in your booking.

Finnair only purchases SAF made from raw materials that do not compete with food production or harm biodiversity. All the SAF we use meets the strict sustainability criteria set by the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED) or CORSIA. For example, biofuels that comply with EU regulations must reduce CO₂ emissions by at least 65%.

While each individual contribution has a modest impact, we believe that every step matters in advancing the use and production of SAF.

Finnair for Business and Finnair Cargo customers can also participate:

Follow the progress

We are committed to increasing our SAF usage. The share of SAF in our fuel mix will grow through both regulatory mandates and voluntary actions.

Until 2024, our SAF usage was primarily voluntary. As of 2025,

5%. This includes the mandated SAF, contributions from individual customers and voluntary SAF purchases funded by Finnair and our corporate partners. As we fuel our aircraft also outside the EU, the percentage reflects the share of SAF in relation to our global fuel consumption.

Since November 2024, customers have been able to contribute to SAF purchases when booking their flights online. A year later, at the end of October 2025, the total number of contributions was around 70,600. One contribution includes the SAF purchase for a one-way flight.

We invest our customers’ contributions in SAF twice a year and report on the progress in the same time frame. As the service was launched in November 2024, our first reporting period covers contributions from the start of the service until the end of June 2025.

These contributions enabled us to purchase 122 tonnes of SAF, replacing fossil fuel equivalent to the amount needed for approximately 40 flights between Helsinki and Rovaniemi. The fuel was delivered to our home hub, Helsinki Airport, between 17 and 23 September 2025.

Finnair for Business and Cargo customers can contribute to SAF purchases through separate services. Their contributions are not included in the above purchase.

SAF funded by public authorities

Finnair applies for allowances to cover part of the price difference between fossil kerosene and the eligible sustainable aviation fuels. The allowances are issued by The Finnish Trasport and Communication Agency (Traficom).

In September 2025, Finnair was issued around 6,000 allowances of its usage of sustainable aviation fuels according to the Emissions Trading Act and the Emissions Trading Directive. The allowances were based on the SAF usage in 2024, when we used a total of 4,685 metric tonnes (MT) of SAF. Of this volume, 769.47 MT were attributed to flight routes falling within the EU ETS scope.",https://cms.finnair.com/resource/blob/3670042/9e9340e4264f2598f77b506aaf38a3e1/saf-hero-image-data.png,N,,2025-12-17 04:57:08.493361

Egypt’s new $200 million agreement with Qatar to convert used cooking oil into aviation fuel signals a surprising shift from fossil fuel dependency to circular economy innovation in a region historically dominated by petroleum politics.

The Unexpected Alliance

The partnership between Egypt and Qatar represents more than a simple business transaction—it marks a notable diplomatic and economic realignment in the Middle East. Following years of regional tensions and the 2017-2021 diplomatic crisis that saw Qatar isolated by several Arab states including Egypt, this deal demonstrates how environmental innovation can serve as a bridge for renewed cooperation. The agreement positions both nations at the forefront of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in a region where oil has traditionally been extracted from the ground, not recycled from restaurant fryers.

A New Recipe for Energy Security

The $200 million investment taps into an underutilized resource stream that could revolutionize how Middle Eastern nations approach energy production. Egypt, with its population of over 100 million and thriving food service industry, generates substantial quantities of used cooking oil that typically ends up as waste or, worse, illegally recycled back into the food chain. By transforming this waste into aviation fuel, Egypt addresses multiple challenges simultaneously: reducing environmental pollution, creating new revenue streams, and decreasing dependence on traditional petroleum imports for its growing aviation sector.

Qatar’s involvement is equally strategic. As the nation prepares to maintain its position as a global aviation hub post-World Cup, securing sustainable fuel sources aligns with both its environmental commitments and its ambition to remain competitive in an increasingly climate-conscious aviation industry. The partnership could produce up to 200,000 tons of sustainable aviation fuel annually, potentially reducing carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

Beyond the Environmental Benefits

This deal reflects a broader transformation in Middle Eastern economic thinking. For decades, the region’s wealth and geopolitical influence stemmed from vast underground petroleum reserves. Now, nations are discovering value in what sits above ground—even in their garbage. The cooking oil-to-fuel model could be replicated across the region, where similar waste streams exist in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and other populous nations with large food service sectors.

The initiative also addresses youth employment, a critical challenge across the Arab world. Creating collection networks for used cooking oil, establishing processing facilities, and developing the technical expertise for SAF production could generate thousands of jobs in an entirely new green economy sector. This represents a departure from the traditional petroleum industry’s capital-intensive but employment-light model.

Challenges on the Horizon

However, significant obstacles remain. Establishing efficient collection systems for used cooking oil across Egypt’s diverse geography—from Cairo’s dense urban restaurants to rural food establishments along the Nile—will require substantial infrastructure investment and behavioral change. The technology for converting cooking oil to aviation fuel, while proven, remains costly compared to conventional fuel production. Success will depend on continued government support, international carbon pricing mechanisms that favor sustainable fuels, and the aviation industry’s willingness to pay premium prices for greener alternatives.

As Egypt and Qatar embark on this innovative partnership, they raise a compelling question for the entire region: Can the Middle East transform from being the world’s gas station to becoming its recycling pioneer, finding new prosperity not in extracting resources but in reimagining waste?",https://middleeast24.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cropped-8dfa8ba6-6f57-4664-a56d-e20e0fac3ed3-1-150x150.png,N,,2025-12-17 04:57:16.245454

Egypt’s new partnership with Qatar to transform used cooking oil into aviation fuel represents a bold pivot from petro-dependence to circular economy innovation in a region historically defined by fossil fuel wealth.

The Middle East’s Unlikely Green Revolution

The $200 million agreement between Egypt and Qatar marks a significant departure from traditional energy partnerships in the Middle East. While the region has long been synonymous with oil production and export, this deal signals a growing recognition that the future of energy—even in petroleum-rich nations—may lie in unexpected places. The project aims to establish facilities that will collect and process used cooking oil from restaurants, hotels, and food processing plants, converting what was once considered waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

This initiative comes at a crucial time for Egypt, which faces mounting economic pressures and energy security concerns. With a population exceeding 100 million and growing aviation sector demands, the country has been actively seeking ways to reduce its dependence on imported fuel while meeting international commitments to reduce carbon emissions. The partnership with Qatar, a nation with substantial expertise in energy infrastructure and deep pockets for investment, provides both the technical know-how and financial backing necessary to make this ambitious project viable.

Beyond Environmental Benefits: Economic and Geopolitical Implications

The ramifications of this deal extend far beyond environmental considerations. For Egypt, the project represents an opportunity to create a new value chain that could generate thousands of jobs in collection, processing, and distribution networks. Urban centers like Cairo and Alexandria, which produce millions of gallons of used cooking oil annually, could see the emergence of entirely new economic ecosystems built around waste collection and processing.

From a geopolitical perspective, the partnership demonstrates Qatar’s strategic pivot toward sustainable investments following years of diplomatic isolation and economic diversification efforts. By investing in green energy projects across the region, Qatar is positioning itself as a leader in the Middle East’s energy transition, potentially softening its image and building new alliances beyond traditional fossil fuel partnerships.

The Aviation Industry’s Desperate Search for Solutions

The global aviation industry faces immense pressure to decarbonize, with international agreements mandating significant emissions reductions by 2050. Sustainable aviation fuel represents one of the few viable pathways to achieving these targets without completely revolutionizing aircraft technology. However, current SAF production meets less than 0.1% of global jet fuel demand, making projects like the Egypt-Qatar initiative critical for scaling up production capacity.

The choice of used cooking oil as a feedstock is particularly strategic. Unlike other biofuel sources that compete with food production or require dedicated agricultural land, used cooking oil represents a true waste product that would otherwise contribute to environmental pollution. In a region where food security remains a critical concern, this approach avoids the ethical dilemmas associated with first-generation biofuels.

Challenges and Skepticism

Despite the promise, significant challenges remain. Establishing efficient collection networks for used cooking oil in a region with varying levels of infrastructure development will require substantial coordination and investment. Questions also arise about the scalability of the technology and whether the $200 million investment will yield sufficient fuel quantities to make a meaningful impact on Egypt’s aviation fuel needs.

Moreover, the project must navigate complex regulatory frameworks and ensure that the produced fuel meets stringent international aviation standards. The success of this initiative could set a precedent for similar projects across the Middle East and North Africa, but failure could discourage future investments in sustainable aviation fuel production in the region.

As the world watches Egypt and Qatar embark on this unconventional energy partnership, one question looms large: Will this project prove that even the most oil-rich regions can successfully transition to a circular economy, or will it serve as a cautionary tale about the limits of turning yesterday’s waste into tomorrow’s fuel?",https://middleeast24.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cropped-8dfa8ba6-6f57-4664-a56d-e20e0fac3ed3-1-150x150.png,N,,2025-12-17 01:56:19.697148

The association’s May 20 White Plains Regional Forum will be held at HPN, the same location as last year’s event.

The association has had to shift the date for the forum because of newly planned construction work on the airport’s primary runway during the second quarter of 2026. The Westchester County Airport Authority has informed NBAA that the construction work at HPN will not be disruptive to the forum.

“We look forward to hosting what has become an essential event, bringing together aircraft, exhibitors, networking opportunities and important conversations with industry’s most knowledgeable professionals all in one place,” said NBAA President and CEO Ed Bolen.

“Our thanks to the airport officials who worked with NBAA to update our plans for the forum and ensure that it will proceed in a smooth and coordinated manner. We also look forward to continuing our longstanding relationship with the team at Million Air’s White Plains FBO facility, and we appreciate their flexibility in working with us to produce the forum on the event’s new date.”

NBAA’s Regional Forums convene thousands of attendees, hundreds of exhibitors, an aircraft showcase and a lineup of expert-led discussions about the industry’s hottest topics for a single-day event. Participants highly value the forums’ peerless opportunities for in-person networking, business planning and professional development.

DevvStream Corp. (Nasdaq: DEVS) (“DevvStream”), Southern Energy Renewables Inc. (“Southern”), and XCF Global, Inc. (“XCF”) (Nasdaq: SAFX) today announced a non-binding tripartite memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) to jointly explore the potential development of a next-generation low-carbon fuels platform designed to accelerate sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”) adoption, expand domestic capacity, and integrate environmental-attribute monetization into a unified customer offering.

By 2030, the U.S. SAF market is projected to reach nearly $7 billion, while global demand is expected to exceed 5.5 billion gallons, with ~4 billion people living in countries that utilize SAF for air transportation, driving the global market past ~$25 billion. Looking ahead to 2050, the global SAF market could exceed ~$250 billion. This collaboration is intended to position the parties with a unified platform that directly supports this long-term growth.

The goal of the collaboration is to increase long-term SAF supply across multiple production pathways, and to advance the transparency and commercialization of environmental attributes. As part of the negotiation of a binding agreement, the parties expect to evaluate the commercial viability of developing a HEFA-based “Gen 1” SAF facility in Louisiana alongside Southern’s previously announced biomass-based “Gen 2” SAF gasification facility.

Potential Unified Commercial Platform & Strategic Integration

The parties intend to negotiate a definitive collaboration agreement which, if executed, would create a collaborative venture that intends to develop a unified commercial platform that enables customers to procure fuel, logistics services, and environmental-attribute value through a single integrated offering. If developed, this structure would be expected to simplify procurement, improve pricing efficiency, and enhance long-term customer retention across the aviation and industrial markets.

Potential Environmental-Attribute Monetization and Digital Infrastructure

A core component of the potential collaboration is expected to be the integration of environmental-attribute capabilities, including voluntary and compliance carbon credits, CORSIA units, renewable energy certificates, digital MRV solutions, and tokenized environmental-attribute tracking systems. Under the MOU, DevvStream is expected to lead the generation, verification, and monetization of environmental assets associated with the potential platform’s low-carbon fuels.

The parties plan to work towards jointly evaluating solutions to help customers capture, verify, and monetize environmental attributes, including LCFS credits, RINs, and benefits under 45Z/45Q. The parties also plan to evaluate lifecycle analysis (“LCA”) methodologies and carbon-intensity optimization systems which may strengthen project economics and support high-integrity SAF development.

“This collaboration has the potential to create the foundation for a first-of-its-kind, fully integrated low-carbon fuels platform, linking production, logistics, and environmental-attribute systems into a seamless value chain,” said Chris Cooper, CEO of XCF. “If we succeed in combining Southern’s developmental stage biomass-to-methanol-to-jet technology, DevvStream’s environmental-attribute and digital MRV capabilities, and XCF’s HEFA production and commercial infrastructure, we see the potential to build a revolutionary end-to-end system that unlocks new value for customers and potentially accelerate the scaling of SAF in a disciplined, capital-efficient way.”

“Integrating environmental assets directly into the fuel value chain is essential to accelerating SAF deployment,” said Carl Stanton, Chairman of DevvStream. “This collaboration has the potential to bring together three distinct strengths—XCF’s production expertise, Southern’s developing advanced biomass platform, and DevvStream’s environmental-asset monetization capabilities—to help improve project economics while giving airlines confidence in the integrity of their SAF purchases.”

“We believe partnering with XCF and DevvStream would strengthen our ability to scale a multi-pathway SAF strategy grounded in real production capacity and real climate benefit,” said Jay Patel, CEO of Southern. “We are eager to work together to further develop our experimental $SAF token on Solana with DevvStream. Further, we believe Louisiana has the workforce, infrastructure, and feedstock resources to become a national leader in low-carbon fuels, and we see this potential collaboration as a major step toward that future.”

The MOU reflects a shared intent to collaborate on SAF and other low-carbon fuel opportunities. Any specific offtake arrangements, investments, or project development activities described in this release remain subject to confirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, internal corporate approvals, and any required regulatory or permitting approvals. Accordingly, the MOU does not commit any party to proceed with any particular transaction or project.

The figure below shows how growing imports have supported U.S. BBD consumption.
The gap was filled by more imports of vegetable oil, fat oil, and grease.
Greater demand for vegetable oil will increase its price, likely around 12% based on a previous analysis of the relationship between biodiesel demand and global vegetable oil prices.
This is perhaps unsurprising, as current growth in vegetable oil production is concentrated in Brazil and Indonesia, where agricultural expansion often relies on high carbon-stock forested land.","In the last 20 years, the U.S. transportation fuel landscape has transformed: electric vehicles emerged as a clear path to zero-emissions road transport while growth in domestic oil production eliminated U.S. dependence on imported oil. Yet the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a 2005 law requiring the use of biofuels in transport, remains stuck in an era when biofuels seemed like the only option to reduce transportation greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and U.S. dependence on foreign oil. The latest proposal from EPA doubles down on this outdated vision. It would raise food and fuel costs for consumers by increasing the amount of biomass-based diesel (BBD) mandated under the program without delivering meaningful GHG emission benefits.

EPA’s proposal increases renewable volume obligations (RVOs), the mandatory volumes that specify how much biofuel must be supplied. It also halves the compliance value of imported fuel or fuel produced from imported feedstocks by reducing the generation of renewable identification numbers (RINs)—credits used for compliance with renewable fuel blending mandates. For every gallon of biofuel produced from imported feedstock, twice as much fuel must be supplied to meet RFS obligations. Fuels like biodiesel produced from imported used cooking oil now generate half the compliance value of a domestic fuel, such as soy-derived biodiesel.

EPA justifies these changes by emphasizing the economic and energy security benefits of domestic feedstocks. However, overall U.S. consumption of fats and oils for fuel and other purposes such as cooking and animal feed already exceeds total domestic production. Instead of supporting domestic feedstock producers, the proposal would increase U.S. reliance on imported fats and oils.

The figure below shows how growing imports have supported U.S. BBD consumption. In 2019, domestic fat and oil production met 84% of demand. By 2024, this had fallen to 68%. The gap was filled by more imports of vegetable oil, fat oil, and grease. The United States turned from a net exporter of 0.6 million tonnes in 2019 to a net importer of 3.1 million tonnes in 2024.

As illustrated by the figure, U.S. fat and oil imports would dramatically increase under the proposal; net vegetable oil imports are projected to surge by around 5 million tonnes (from 6.1 to 11.0 MMT). Greater demand for vegetable oil will increase its price, likely around 12% based on a previous analysis of the relationship between biodiesel demand and global vegetable oil prices.

However, a more dramatic price spike is possible. As described in EPA’s Draft Regulatory Impact Assessment, the 2020–2022 vegetable oil price shock that increased global prices from $700 to $1,800 per metric ton was likely caused by biofuel-driven demand and weather-related supply disruptions. The projected 5 million tonne net increase in U.S. vegetable oil imports is equivalent to 6% of the current global vegetable oil trade, creating a risk of short-term price spikes as global oilseed production responds to the additional demand.

According to EPA analysis, this huge increase in BBD consumption will not even meaningfully reduce U.S. GHG emissions, with savings equivalent to less than 1% of road sector emissions at best. One EPA model even suggests that the use of crop-based BBD fuels would increase GHGs. This is perhaps unsurprising, as current growth in vegetable oil production is concentrated in Brazil and Indonesia, where agricultural expansion often relies on high carbon-stock forested land. Indeed, groundbreaking work from Chen et al. has found that that global demand for BBD between 2002 and 2018 drove the conversion of approximately 1.7 million hectares of forest to oil palm. This means continued market-mediated oil crop expansion could very well offset any emissions reductions from additional BBD use in the United States.

Finally, the proposal’s claims of energy security benefits are unconvincing. Will energy security really be improved by replacing a domestic energy source (petroleum) with one we have to import? And while EPA assumes that the United States will remain the preferred destination for BBD feedstocks globally, this isn’t guaranteed. Changing policies in China have dramatically reduced used cooking oil exports to the United States, and sustainable aviation fuel mandates in the European Union and United Kingdom will heighten competition for feedstock.

Overall, EPA projects its current proposal will saddle consumers with $6.8 billion in extra fuel costs and $2.4 billion in higher food prices each year, all without meaningful emissions cuts or improved U.S. energy independence. Twenty years in, we need a wholesale reconsideration of the Renewable Fuel Standard— the inconsistencies of EPA’s proposal show exactly why reform is needed.",https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/iStock-1412869394.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 13:56:17.052504

“Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are a core element of our sustainability strategy.","From 2027, Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) will purchase at least 200 tons of solar jet fuel from Synhelion annually, pioneering the use of this innovative fuel in civil aviation. The agreement marks an important milestone on the road to more sustainable aviation.

Synhelion will produce renewable synthetic crude oil, known as “syncrude”, at its first commercial plant. The syncrude will be processed in anexisting refinery together with fossil crude oil and refined into certified Jet-A-1 fuel. Thus, Synhelion directly replaces fossil crude oil with sustainable syncrude, without the need for any adjustments to the existing infrastructure. The fuel will be delivered to the airport via the regular logistics chain and fed into the fuel supply system. Synhelion’s synthetic jet fuel is based on renewable energy and sustainable feedstocks.

“The partnership with Synhelion is a significant step for SWISS on the path to decarbonizing our flight operations,” says Jens Fehlinger, CEO of SWISS. “Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are a core element of our sustainability strategy. The offtake agreement with Synhelion sends a strong signal for innovation and responsibility in aviation.”

Synhelion also emphasizes the significance of the agreement: “The fact that SWISS, a leading airline, has committed early on to adopt our fuels demonstrates confidence in the market readiness of ourtechnology,” says Philipp Furler, Co-CEO and Co-Founder of Synhelion. “This partnership is a milestone for the commercial market launch of our fuels – and sets a powerful example to other airlines worldwide.”

(ChiniMandi) India is likely to shift to ethanol-blended aviation fuel by mid-2027, gradually ramping it up in phases, with the addition of more than two dozen distilleries supported by federal biofuel incentives, an official familiar with the details said on Sunday, reported Hindustan Times.

The country, which has the world’s third-largest aviation market, is aiming to introduce 1% ethanol blending in jet fuel by 2027, raise it to 2% in 2028 and further to 5% by 2030. Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation Murlidhar Mohol had shared these targets in Parliament earlier this month.

India has already carried out trial flights using cleaner aviation fuel. In March 2023, Air Vistara, which has since merged with Air India, operated a long-haul Boeing 787 flight from the United States to India using fuel blended. In the same year, Air Asia flew the country’s first commercial domestic flight between Pune and Delhi with a fuel blend.

According to the news report, a long-pending policy on sustainable aviation fuel is likely to be released for public consultations next month, the official said, requesting anonymity.

International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has adopted Carbon Offsetting & Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) as a global market-based measure to reduce emissions from international aviation which require offsetting of emissions above a baseline value. Airlines can either use SAF or offset their emissions by purchasing carbon credits from ICAO approved Emissions Unit Programmes. SAF offers a direct pathway to emission reduction by lowering the lifecycle carbon footprint of aviation fuel. When airlines adopt CORSIA Eligible SAF (CORSIA Eligible Fuel) certified against ICAO’s sustainability standards and verified through Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV), they can claim these reductions as substitutes for carbon credits, thereby decreasing their offsetting obligations under the scheme.

The Centre is supporting biofuel projects through the Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana, which provides financial assistance for setting up plants, including those producing aviation fuel.

Under the scheme, the government offers interest support for five years, including a one-year repayment break, on loans taken to set up new ethanol distilleries. The support covers interest up to 6% per year or half of the bank’s lending rate, whichever is lower.",https://advancedbiofuelsusa.info/assets/images/Advanced-Biofuels-Logo.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 14:56:20.419191

This ‘stop-the-clock’ measure, part of the Omnibus VI simplification package, delays requirements for relabeling, formatting, advertising, and online sales, which were originally set for mid-2026 and early 2027. The move aims to reduce regulatory burdens, especially for SMEs, while maintaining safety standards. The adopted regulation will be now published in the Official Journal and enter into force 20 days later.

Omnibus I: Sustainable Reporting Requirements

On November 13, the European Parliament adopted its position on amendments to the scope of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. Under its current position, reporting would apply only to large firms with over 1,750 employees and over €450 million net annual turnover, with fewer qualitative details required to be submitted. Sector-specific reporting would become a voluntary process. Due diligence duties would cover very large corporations to include those with over 5,000 employees and an annual net turnover of more than €1.5 billion, using a risk-based approach and relying on existing data. Transition plans would no longer be required, and liability would be at national level. Institutional negotiations are expected to take place and remains unclear if further amendments will be set out.

EU Climate Law Amendment

On November 13, the European Parliament adopted its position on amending the EU Climate Law. The amendment sets out a binding target to cut net GHG emissions by 90% by 2040, compared to 1990 levels. From 2036, up to five percentage points of reductions could come from high-quality international carbon credits, subject to strict safeguards following concerns from the European Commission. MEPs also backed postponing ETS2, covering CO₂ emissions from buildings and road transport, by one year to 2028. This target is set to be reviewed biennially. The European Parliament will now begin negotiations with Member States on the final law.

Legislative Package on One Substance, One Assessment Adopted

On November 13, the Council of the EU adopted the ‘One Substance, One Assessment’ (OSOA) legislative package to streamline chemical safety evaluations across the EU. The new rules aim to speed up regulatory action on chemical risks, improving health and leading to better and faster environmental protection. OSOA also aims to enhance consistency and efficiency in assessments for sectors such as food, toys, pesticides and medical devices. It introduces a common data platform, integrating information from over 70 EU laws and including a database of safer alternatives. The package also clarifies EU agency responsibilities and strengthens institutional cooperation. The adopted acts will be now published in the Official Journal and enter into force 20 days later.

Revision of the New Legislative Framework

On November 12, the European Commission opened a consultation on revising the New Legislative Framework (NFL). The NFL underpins EU product safety rules, CE marking, and market access. The proposed changes aim to simplify requirements, reduce administrative burdens, and improve coherence across sectors, ensuring products remain safe and compliant while supporting sustainability and fair competition. Potential changes include introducing a digital product passport, aiming to support the EU’s circular economy objectives.

Sustainability Reporting Standards Postponed

On November 10, the Quick Fix Delegated Regulation was published, providing targeted relief postponing certain sustainability reporting requirements under the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) framework. This Regulation provides reporting relief to first wave businesses subject to ESRS, allowing businesses to omit certain disclosures, such as anticipated financial effects of sustainability risks until FY2027. Also, businesses with 750 employees or more will also benefit from the same phase-in provisions that apply to businesses with 750 employees or less.

Taxonomy Delegated Acts

On November 7, the European Commission launched calls for evidence on proposed amendments to the Taxonomy Climate Act and the Environmental Delegated Act. These Acts set technical screening criteria for activities aligned with six EU environmental objectives. The planned changes aim to improve clarity, usability, and legal certainty by simplifying criteria and reducing complexity. Feedback will inform targeted revisions to enhance cost-effectiveness and coherence of the EU Taxonomy framework. The feedback period closed on December 5.

UK

Autumn Budget Announcement

On November 26, the Government announced their Autumn Budget. As part of the budget, the Government put forward a range of sustainability-related measures. The key announcements include:

capital infrastructure will be invested in to support, among other things, greater energy security across the country, with additional investment being announced for “major growth projects”

confirmation the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) would be introduced under the Finance Bill 2025-2026. Indirect emissions within scope of CBAM will be delayed until 2029. The Government is considering including refined products in CBAM in future

confirmation the standard and lower rates of landfill tax would not be merged into a single rate

confirmation the UK Plastic Packaging Tax (PPT) rate for 2026 to 2027 will increase in line with CPI inflation

confirmation a consultation would be launched on the introduction of mandatory certification for mechanically recycled plastic packaging for businesses to claim an exemption from PPT

Planning and Infrastructure Bill

On November 24, the Planning and Infrastructure Bill cleared the House of Lords. The Bill has now returned to the House of Commons, where it will consider the amendments made. Key amendments made by the House of Lords include:

enhanced protections for chalk streams

prioritisation to redevelop of brownfield sites

proposal that the Government publish an assessment of the impact of existing regulations on low-hazard reservoirs and, within six months of the Bill’s enactment, set out proposals for their deregulation

The Bill is sat with the House of Commons, who will review the amendments on December 8.

Employment Rights Bill

On November 15, the House of Commons rejected several House of Lords’ amendments to the Employment Rights Bill. The Bill now returns to the House of Lords to review the government’s stated reasons for rejecting the amendments. These include:

protection from unfair dismissal should apply from the first day of employment

workers who meet the qualifying criteria should automatically receive a guaranteed hours offer, rather than having to request one

the requirement that industrial action is only valid if at least 50% of eligible voters participate in the ballot should be removed

FRC issues ISSA (UK) 5000

On November 12, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) issued International Standard on Sustainability Assurance (ISSA) (UK) 5000, “General Requirements for Sustainability Assurance Engagements”, providing UK companies, investors and assurance providers with internationally aligned voluntary assurance standards. This UK adaptation of the global IAASB standard provides requirements for both limited and reasonable assurance engagements. Designed for voluntary use, it aims to enhance the credibility of sustainability reporting, support informed investment decisions. The standard reflects FRC’s commitment to internationally aligned frameworks, promoting consistent assurance practices and reliable information for investors.

Draft Amendment to the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging and Packaging Waste) (Amendment) Regulations 2025

On November 3, draft regulations amending the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging and Packaging Waste) Regulations 2025 were published. The changes, effective from January 1, 2026, allow deductions for recycled food-grade plastics collected in closed-loop systems, and clarify producer obligations. The amendments aim to close loopholes and simplify compliance for in-scope businesses.

US

Endangered Species Act Regulations

On November 19, 2025, the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed four rules under the Endangered Species Act regulations, to require economic impacts to play a greater role in listing decisions and critical habitat designations, narrow the effects that must be considered under Section 7 consultation, and to remove the “blanket rule” that applied the same protections for “threatened” species as those that apply to “endangered” species.

Waters of the United States Rule

On November 17, 2025, the EPA and US Army Corps of Engineers issued a proposed rule to revise the definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act. The stated purpose of the rule is to conform the definition with the US Supreme Court’s decision Sackett v. EPA. Among other things, the proposed rule provides jurisdiction over only tributaries connection to traditional navigable waters, provides definitions for “continuous surface connection” and “relatively permanent,” eliminates “interstate waters” from the definition of WOTUS, and revises exclusions for ditches, waste treatment systems, prior converted cropland, and groundwater.

EPA Proposes Amendments to PFAS Reporting

On November 11, 2025 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced plans to amend requirements for businesses to report PFAS use under the Toxic Substances Control Act. The original rule, finalized in 2023, mandated reporting on PFAS usage between 2011 and 2022, related to exposure and any existing environmental and health effects. The proposal introduces exemptions for PFAS in concentrations of 0.1% or lower, imported articles, certain byproducts, impurities, research chemicals, and non-isolated intermediates. Public comments on the revisions will be accepted for 45 days before final rules are issued.

In this category, there are currently more ammonia-ready vessels than methanol-ready vessels, but the orderbook shows methanol leading the charge.
Hanna Campbell, market development director at the Michigan Soybean Committee and managing director for the Michigan Advanced Biofuels Coalition, sees a unique challenge in the maritime industry.
For many years, they have been trialing biodiesel and testing the waters on different decarbonization options.” Even with the consensus for biofuels, Carr raises a critical question.
Number one on the IMO’s list of priorities is creating a level playing field for the maritime industry while maintaining safety and efficiency standards across the globe.","In mid-October, the International Maritime Organization’s Marine Environment Protection Committee convened for its second extraordinary session to discuss the potential adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework.

With more than 80% of global trade and 40% of U.S. imports and exports moving through the maritime sector, it’s no surprise that decarbonization efforts are increasingly focused on ships operating in both brown waters—navigable inland or coastal routes—and blue, or international deep-sea, waters. And for good reason, according to Ed Carr, partner at Energy & Environmental Research Associates. “If ships were a country, they would be somewhere around Mexico or Japan in terms of their greenhouse gas emissions,” Carr notes. “It’s approximately 2.9 or 3 percent of global emissions, but a small percentage of a very large number is still a pretty big number.

“The marine sector is not one sector, [and] not all ships are created equal,” Carr continues. “Within shipping, you’ve got dozens of different sectors that operate differently because of their needs. The IMO estimates have [the maritime industry’s fuel demand] at 300 to 330 million metric tons (mmt) of residual or HFO-equivalent fuels per year.”

Pete Probst, president and cofounder of Indigenous Energy, notes the steep environmental cost of not decarbonizing the maritime sector. “When you look at CO2 on a life-cycle basis, for every five years that we wait to reduce the carbon emissions, there’s an additional 13 times more carbon carbon accumulated, which we then have to get rid of.”

The benefits of decarbonizing outweigh the upfront costs. That does not mean, however, that the costs are easy to balance.

Reeling in Emissions

While there is no shortage of alternative fuels being used to decarbonize the maritime sector—methanol, ammonia, hydrogen, LNG and biofuels—the move to net-zero emissions is easier said than done. “There are currently more vessels that can fire using methanol than ammonia,” Carr explains. “But the industry is investing in vessels that currently use conventional fuels, but are designed to be able to use alternative fuels with some retrofits. In this category, there are currently more ammonia-ready vessels than methanol-ready vessels, but the orderbook shows methanol leading the charge. The problem is that most are not actually firing on methanol or ammonia right now. Most of the methanol-capable ones may be using some methanol in their firing, but many of them will be predominantly on conventional fuels.

“The energy density of methanol and ammonia is less than half the energy density, both volumetrically and on a mass basis, of conventional bunkers,” Carr continues. “This means that to go the same distance, you need to carry twice as much [fuel], or you can only go half as far,” he continues. “In those situations, you either need to give up cargo space on your vessel in order to carry more fuel, or you need to retool the way that your operations are working and think about refueling more frequently.” The largest container ships can store up to 4.5 million gallons of fuel onboard; giving up cargo space for more fuel or increasing stops could lead to further hurdles.

Hanna Campbell, market development director at the Michigan Soybean Committee and managing director for the Michigan Advanced Biofuels Coalition, sees a unique challenge in the maritime industry. “The [maritime] fueling system is a little bit different as to how vessels get fuel,” she says. “There aren’t as many players in the game; it's not like an over-the-road truck stopping at any truck stop or gas station along the way. Fueling on the Great Lakes is more of a closed system. It’s easier to speak with the different players because there aren’t as many.”

Regardless of the challenges involved in decarbonizing the industry, Campbell, Probst and Carr all agree on what must come next. “If any of this is going to decarbonize, something’s got to fill the gap, which is where biofuels come in,” Carr says, adding that biofuels made from renewable feedstocks like soybean oil are readily available and proven solutions to decarbonize vessels today.

Probst and Campbell both note the easier transition to biodiesel compared to other alternative fuels like methanol and ammonia.

“[Biodiesel] has been around for a long time,” Probst explains. “The technical specs have been ironed out, so there are no issues with runningbiodiesel at all different blends in any type of diesel applications, including marine vessels. You can do that with pre-existing equipment. You don’t have to change anything on the dock in terms of fueling; you don’t have to change anything, really, in the engine or on the vessels. You can use biodiesel just like you would your petroleum diesel.”

Campbell explains the push toward biodiesel in the U.S. Great Lakes maritime system has been spurred by recent domestic triggers, but our northern neighbors are well-versed. “For a lot of companies, specifically on the Canadian side, biodiesel is nothing new. For many years, they have been trialing biodiesel and testing the waters on different decarbonization options.”

Even with the consensus for biofuels, Carr raises a critical question. “All of this stuff comes with a cost premium, right? [Unless] you have a carrier who’s willing to pay that cost premium [or] you’ve got a client who’s willing to say, ‘Yeah, move my goods with lower carbon intensity,’ … why would anybody be willing to take on that investment when their competitors don’t have to?”

In the Wake

This imbalance in capital and other resources is where the value of the IMO lies. Number one on the IMO’s list of priorities is creating a level playing field for the maritime industry while maintaining safety and efficiency standards across the globe. For this reason, the significance of the MEPC’s work in October cannot be understated.

“Decarbonizing ships is comparatively hard to decarbonizing land-based electricity,” Carr says. “Going into [the MEPC extraordinary session], a lot of countries were thinking very positively, and a lot of industry was talking very positively [because] it provided a sense of certainty that these folks would now be able to tailor and operate their businesses … within that framework.”

“Prior IMO policy required a switch to low-sulfur fuel, so the shipping industry is already looking for cleaner, available fuels,” adds Paul Winters, director of public affairs and federal communications at Clean Fuels Alliance America. This opens pathways for alternative fuels. And while each fuel has its role, biofuels—namely, biodiesel and renewable iesel (RD)—are operation-ready today.

The IMO Net-Zero Framework, which was approved by MEPC 83 held in April this year, comprised of new international regulations aligning with the IMO’s 2023 GHG Strategy, including two specific changes: a global fuel standard, and a global GHG emissions pricing mechanism. “The framework was designed not to say you must use methanol or ammonia or hydrogen or biofuels; it was designed to say that the carbon intensity of your fuel starts here, and over time has to get lower. It didn’t put a cap on emissions in total. It just said the carbon intensity of the fuel has to come down,” Carr explains.

“Some folks did not like what was being proposed at the IMO and worked hard to oppose what was going on …Ultimately, they punted a year down the road,” he says. “And some of the arguments were legitimate. There was a big question mark about how the IMO’s financial framework fit with Europe’s financial framework. That was not cleanly addressed in the regulations that were written, and it was an issue that was picked upon by some folks … and there were some other things that were left as guidelines or other things that need to be sorted out.”

With the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework decision pushed to next October, on approval, the start date for the framework has been delayed to 2028. More concerning, the lack of set guidelines marks a time of increased uncertainty in the international sector.

This does not mean, however, that the industry has found itself stalled. In the U.S., the bipartisan Renewable Fuel for Ocean-Going Vessels Act has seen success in the Senate. Introduced to both the Senate and House by Sens. Pete Ricketts (R-NE) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-IA), John Garamendi (D-CA) and six others, respectively, the legislation would revise the Renewable Fuel Standard to support farmers providing fuel to the maritime sector.

“Right now, the RFS requires biofuel producers to retire RINs from gallons of fuels used in ocean-going vessels. This includes ships operating in the Great Lakes, since they are in international waters,” Winters says. “The Renewable Fuels for Ocean-Going Vessels Act would make a simple change to allow fuel producers to keep the RINs and their value. It has bipartisan, bicameral support. It recently received a hearing in the U.S. Senate, so it can move forward toward adoption in the current Congress.”

Seizing the Seas

An additional area of special interest in the IMO Net-Zero Mandate, Carr says, is regarding whether the application of crop-based biofuels will be allowed. The FuelEU Maritime regulation—the law of the EU maritime land as of January this year—incentivizes lower-carbon alternative fuels; but just like its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) counterpart, ReFuelEU, FuelEU Maritime currently bars crop-based biofuels from eligibility in European markets. “[The crop-based biofuels ban] means that the U.S. markets don’t have access to European markets on that front,” Carr notes. “From a U.S. perspective, that makes a big difference in terms of what’s going out there, and it makes a big difference globally, too, in terms of how much feedstock there’s going to be.”

Until the October 2026 reconvening of the MEPC and further industry guidance, stateside movement toward renewables incentives in the maritime sector remain promising for biodiesel and RD producers. And for some, the policy changes are following behind their own initiatives. Campbell points to the Port of Detroit, which in April 2024 released its Decarbonization and Air Quality Improvement Plan to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2040. “[The Port of Detroit] is very committed to particulate matter emissions and things like that specifically for the benefit of the communities around the port,” she says. “That commitment helps spur on folks at the terminals and ships coming through.”

Under current RFS guidelines, Winters says, U.S. biodiesel and RD producers are discouraged from supplying to the maritime sector. “They’re missing an opportunity to serve a multibillion-gallon fuel market,” he adds. “Since biodiesel and renewable diesel production represents 10% of the value of all domestically grown soybeans, expansion of the market would directly benefit U.S. farmers and feedstock providers.”

Those benefits, Campbell notes, would include opportunities for biodiesel producers to sell more of their product locally. “There are two biodiesel producers in Michigan, and traditionally a lot of their biodiesel tends to leave the state,” she says. “The maritime market is a big opportunity to keep that circular biodiesel ecosystem here.”

Despite the delay in international guidelines, Carr says the first steps have been made. “Shipping was poised and really on the edge of the first global GHG standard, which is a big deal. It didn’t end up happening—yet. Hopefully it will, but just the fact that an industry that moves in the way that shipping does—historically having taken its time to ensure that things are safe and not going to be a hazard to operate—and was willing to engage in that, I think that says a lot about what’s happening now.”

The syncrude will be processed in an existing refinery together with fossil crude oil and refined into certified Jet-A-1 fuel. Thus, Synhelion directly replaces fossil crude oil with sustainable syncrude, without the need for any adjustments to the existing infrastructure. The fuel will be delivered to the airport via the regular logistics chain and fed into the fuel supply system. Synhelion’s synthetic jet fuel is based on renewable energy and sustainable feedstocks.

A strong signal for sustainable aviation

“The partnership with Synhelion is a significant step for SWISS on the path to decarbonizing our flight operations,” says Jens Fehlinger, CEO of SWISS. “Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are a core element of our sustainability strategy. The offtake agreement with Synhelion sends a strong signal for innovation and responsibility in aviation.”

With this offtake agreement, SWISS is actively supporting the scaling of Synhelion’s technology for the production of renewable synthetic fuels as a customer, investor, and strategic partner. This long-term planning certainty enables targeted expansion of production capacity and helps reduce costs over time.

Pioneering partnership

Synhelion also emphasizes the significance of the agreement: “The fact that SWISS, a leading airline, has committed early on to adopt our fuels demonstrates confidence in the market readiness of our technology,” says Philipp Furler, Co-CEO and Co-Founder of Synhelion. “This partnership is a milestone for the commercial market launch of our fuels – and sets a powerful example to other airlines worldwide.”

Expanding the partnership with Kuehne+Nagel

Part of the renewable jet fuel produced by Synhelion will be resold by SWISS to the logistics service provider Kuehne+Nagel. The company will use the sustainable fuel for air freight transportation with Swiss WorldCargo, offering its customers a tangible solution to reduce their carbon footprint in global logistics.

First delivery already completed

In July 2025, SWISS became the first airline in the world to use solar fuel from Synhelion in regular flight operations. Synhelion delivered its first barrel of syncrude from its DAWN plant to a refinery in northern Germany, where the syncrude was processed into certified jet fuel (Jet-A-1) and subsequently fed into the fuel supply system via Hamburg Airport.

A recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that carbon capture and storage remains among the least effective and most expensive emissions solutions when compared with renewable energy.

Airco takes a different approach. Instead of burying CO2, the company converts it into new products. It began with small consumer items, such as vodka and perfume, to prove out its chemistry.

With stable, predictable policy, we can unlock the next wave of SAF supply and help aviation deliver the climate transition this decade demands.","2025 will be remembered as the year sustainable aviation fuel finally began to scale. After a decade of pilot schemes and policy debate, the global aviation sector has entered a new phase, one driven by firm regulation, clear ambition from airlines, and the rapid build-out of SAF projects across multiple pathways.

For those of us working to bring new production online, the momentum is real. But there are risks as well. Events this year suggest that, despite unprecedented progress, political uncertainty still plays a notable role in shaping SAF investment.

Regulation Is Moving in the Right Direction, and Fast

The past 18 months have seen the most supportive policy signals the SAF industry has ever received.

The UK has led from the front, putting its SAF mandate into law and giving the market a timetable that matters: 2% in 2025, 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040. The UK’s decision to pair this mandate with a revenue certainty mechanism is unique globally: a recognition that early-stage industries need predictable conditions, not just aspirations.

Europe has also stepped up, with ReFuelEU Aviation now live. A binding 6% SAF requirement by 2030 and a trajectory to 70% by 2050 is already reshaping demand curves for airlines and suppliers.

And globally, airlines themselves have set a tone of ambition that often surpasses government expectation. Many now have 10% SAF targets for 2030, and several have signed multi-year offtake agreements that would have been unthinkable five years ago. Engine manufacturers and OEMs are certifying fleets for 100% SAF. Infrastructure owners are preparing for higher blends.

The direction of travel is no longer in doubt: aviation is preparing for a SAF-powered future.

A Wave of Projects Is Taking Shape from the US to the UK

This policy foundation is enabling real deployment. Across North America and Europe, dozens of first-of-a-kind and next-of-a-kind facilities have entered the final stages of engineering, financing or construction. The diversity of technologies and feedstocks coming forward mirrors exactly what the sector needs: Fischer–Tropsch, alcohol-to-jet, gasification routes, and advanced pyrolysis all now have commercial backers and blue-chip customers.

Natural State Renewables is proud to be part of this next chapter. Our flagship project in Arkansas will convert waste wood residues into high quality SAF, with a delivery horizon aligned to the UK’s 2030 mandate. We’ve spent years building a robust feedstock position and a pathway designed to meet the world’s most stringent sustainability standards. It is exactly the kind of project mandates were designed to enable.

As a U.S. producer, we see a tremendous opportunity to work with partners across the UK and Europe to help meet early mandate requirements while domestic capacity scales. Our goal is to complement — not compete with — the region’s growing SAF ecosystem by providing reliable, certified volumes that support near-term demand and strengthen supply-chain resilience as new plants come online.

Across the sector, the progress is striking. Capital is flowing. Technical risk is falling. Producers, airlines and suppliers are collaborating in ways that would have once seemed impossible.

But Momentum Does Not Guarantee Deployment

Political uncertainty has become a significant consideration for SAF investment. Behind the headlines and policy announcements, producers face a common reality: SAF facilities are large, capital-intensive projects that depend on long-term confidence in the regulatory environment.

And right now, that confidence remains fragile.

Across multiple jurisdictions, including those most committed to SAF, there is still uncertainty on future incentives, programme design, and the longevity of support. Changes in government, budget pressures, and shifting political narratives all add risk premiums to project finance.

Investors tell us the same thing: the technology risk is manageable; the market risk is understood; but the political and policy risks remain material.

Without long-term clarity on sustainability criteria, revenue support, accounting rules, and mandate enforcement, producers cannot reach final investment decision at the pace the sector demands. The result is delayed projects, higher capital costs, and slower emissions reductions for aviation.

In short: the key challenge for SAF today is less about engineering and more about policy consistency.

A Strong 2025, But the Market Must Now Move Faster

The good news is that these risks are solvable. Governments have already shown they are willing to take bold, industry-shaping decisions. The UK mandate, in particular, demonstrates that political leadership can give investors exactly what they need: a predictable, rules-based environment where long-term capital can move with confidence.

What comes next is simple but urgent:

clearer long-term signals on revenue support

stability in sustainability and feedstock rules

alignment across jurisdictions to reduce compliance friction

political consistency across electoral cycles

If governments can deliver that certainty, the industry will deliver the rest. We have the feedstocks. We have the pathways. We have the airline demand. What we need now is a policy environment that stays stable for the lifespan of an SAF plant.

Conclusion: A Once-in-a-Generation Opportunity, If We Seize It

2025 has been a turning point. Mandates are in place. Demand is locked in. SAF projects are reaching maturity. The sector has never been more aligned or more ambitious.

But to translate that ambition into tangible decarbonization — steel in the ground, supply into airports, emissions reductions at scale — we must turn momentum into permanence. That means long-term political certainty and globally coherent policy frameworks.

The UK has taken major steps in the right direction, and that leadership matters. If other jurisdictions follow suit, global SAF deployment will accelerate dramatically.

For producers like Natural State Renewables, the message is clear: the opportunity is enormous, the technology is ready, but investment decisions depend on confidence. With stable, predictable policy, we can unlock the next wave of SAF supply and help aviation deliver the climate transition this decade demands.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/64941dbb608c8d7e0842c57f/65b3bcc050e1d25d78e56a64/693fe57091d6583479ab86d7/1765874828063/4.png?format=1500w,N,,2025-12-16 10:57:41.546494

Kuehne+Nagel, a global leader in logistics, and Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS), Switzerland’s flagship carrier, have announced an expansion of their strategic partnership aimed at accelerating sustainable aviation initiatives. The two companies have formalized their collaboration through a memorandum of understanding (MoU) that focuses on leveraging innovative technologies to improve operational efficiency while reducing environmental impact.

Commitment to Sustainable Aviation Fuel

At the heart of this partnership lies a shared commitment to the development and use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced by Synhelion, a Swiss clean technology firm. Synhelion employs a proprietary process that harnesses concentrated sunlight to convert biogenic and recycled carbon into renewable synthetic fuels, including solar jet fuel. By supporting this cutting-edge technology, Kuehne+Nagel and SWISS seek to contribute meaningfully to the long-term decarbonisation of the aviation sector.

To facilitate the scaling of production and foster further innovation, Kuehne+Nagel, SWISS, and its air freight division Swiss WorldCargo have entered into a long-term SAF off-take agreement. This arrangement provides Synhelion with the necessary planning security to expand its production capacity and advance its technology. Such commitments are considered essential for nurturing emerging SAF producers and encouraging wider adoption of sustainable fuels across the industry.

Starting in 2027, Kuehne+Nagel will purchase SAF produced by Synhelion from SWISS under a five-year contract, specifically for use in cargo shipments operated by Swiss WorldCargo. This agreement highlights Kuehne+Nagel’s dedication to decarbonising global logistics and offers its customers a tangible means to reduce the carbon footprint of their air freight operations.

Challenges and Industry Implications

Despite the promising outlook, the transition to sustainable aviation faces significant challenges. Both Kuehne+Nagel and SWISS must navigate potential regulatory obstacles, the complexities of establishing reliable SAF supply chains, and the substantial investments required for new infrastructure. While the partnership is likely to be well received by sustainability-focused investors, some skepticism remains regarding the feasibility and timeline for achieving the ambitious environmental targets set forth.

The announcement is expected to prompt competitive responses within the logistics and airline sectors, with other companies likely to increase their investments in sustainable practices to maintain market relevance. This dynamic could accelerate industry-wide efforts toward sustainability, driving further innovation and the adoption of cleaner technologies.

Kuehne+Nagel and SWISS present their collaboration as a practical example of how airlines and logistics providers can work together to support innovative solutions and expedite the transition to more sustainable aviation. SWISS CEO Jens Fehlinger emphasized the importance of such partnerships, stating, “Sustainable aviation fuels are a key building block for making air travel more sustainable.

To move past abstract assessments and guesswork, global consultancy firm dss+ has developed a practical, stepwise framework that quantifies financial exposure into a clear ‘Value at Risk’ framework.

With the global climate crisis enacting high economic tolls around the world, climate risk is no longer seen as just an abstract sustainability issue related with compliance. It is a real business risk and companies are increasingly aware of the need to take concrete action.

For executive teams, the primary challenge is identifying precisely where climate change affects operations, assets, and long-term growth. They must then determine the most cost-effective path to adaptation.

This approach narrows the focus to actions that matter most, giving leadership a solid basis for prioritization, investment, and accountability. This framework is designed to provide a defensible calculation of financial exposure and consists of ten distinct steps, summarized in the dss+ ‘Road to climate resilience’ workflow.

Source: dss+

Step 0: Organizational Maturity Assessment

Before taking concrete action, it is vital to understand an organization’s current maturity in managing physical climate risks. dss+ uses the Bradley Curve to evaluate this maturity. This scale ranges from a reactive state – driven by compliance – to an interdependent state, where climate resilience is embedded across all functions.

This assessment highlights the gap between the current state and what is required to reduce climate risk to as low as reasonably possible.

Step 1: Identify climate hazards

The process begins by identifying climate hazards, such as temperature extremes, wildfire risk, and tropical storms that could impact operations or the supply chain. Hazards should be shortlisted by focusing on those expected to change significantly over time, using data such as historic incidence, insurance data, and academic research. To maintain a practical analysis, the number of hazards should be limited to no more than ten.

Step 2: Review and shortlist receptors

After climate hazards have been identified, the next step is to understand how they can impact systems or components, referred to as receptors. This review is conducted at the site or operations level and must cover all locations in the value chain.

The approach includes reviewing peer annual reports, examining literature on common receptor vulnerabilities, and analyzing existing site assessments. Targeted reviews and site visits of critical components also help to map key system elements and product flow paths.

Step 3: Potential vulnerability

Next is to synthesize climate hazards and receptors into a Vulnerability Matrix to assess how each hazard could impact critical systems, operations, and the value chain. An initial analysis identifies known vulnerabilities, such as increased temperature driving higher cooling demand, for example.

This analysis is then validated through site visits and engagement with experts, such as maintenance engineers and facility managers. Preliminary hotspots are flagged based on potential infrastructure damage, increased maintenance, production losses, and risks to personnel safety.

Step 4: Quantify Value at Risk

With various vulnerabilities now identified, they are now translated into financial terms by developing damage functions. These mathematical models can estimate potential losses for each receptor-hazard combination under specific climate scenarios.

The outcome is a clear visualization of the Value at Risk (VAR) across the value chain, which enables the identification of financial hotspots and guides cost-effective adaptation strategies. These climate risk assessments should also factor asset condition and maintenance into damage functions for VAR calculations to be as accurate as possible.

Step 5: Estimate probability and financial impact

The most significant risks are identified using a simple five-by-five risk matrix that combines probability and impact. Probability ranges from ‘possible to occur’ to ‘multiple events at the site’, while impact spans from negligible to catastrophic.

Each vulnerability is scored, and multiplying the risk rating by its VAR provides a clear view of financial exposure across the value chain. Climate-driven changes should also be taken into account for an updated profile on operational risks that threaten staff. This ensures decisions reflect both financial and human exposure.

Step 6: Identify adaptation options

This step focuses on developing a comprehensive portfolio of adaptation measures – structural, nature-based, policy, and behavioral – targeting the highest VAR first. Organizations should start with quick wins, such as early warning systems and emergency response plans, before progressing to capital-intensive solutions like infrastructure upgrades and flood defenses. The goal is to create a full ‘wish list’ of potential actions, regardless of initial cost or complexity.

Step 7: Marginal adaptation cost curve

The Marginal Adaptation Cost Curve (MACC) ranks adaptation measures based on their cost-effectiveness in reducing VAR. Each option is plotted according to its implementation cost and the degree to which it lowers financial exposure, providing a clear visual for prioritization.

The MACC considers the entire value chain and accounts for multiple options addressing the same vulnerability. This tool identifies the most cost-effective interventions that deliver the greatest risk reduction.

Step 8: Build an integration roadmap

To minimize VAR within operational and capital constraints, the analysis is translated into a practical, prioritized adaptation roadmap. Multi-criteria decision analysis is used to weigh technical feasibility, cost, social impacts, and institutional capacity, setting clear implementation milestones.

The roadmap must be technically robust but also realistic for an organization to execute. It should align with capital allocation processes and integrate into day-to-day operations and long-term planning.

Step 9: Financing climate risk reduction

Financing determines the pace and scale at which climate risks can be reduced. The quantified VAR, MACC, and roadmap provide the foundation for investment decisions, enabling companies to prioritize the highest-impact, lowest-cost interventions. Companies can either opt to self-fund these initiatives, or look to climate finance, which leverages external funding sources like concessional loans, grants, and resilience bonds.

Step 10: Climate risk program management

Climate risk management is not a one-time exercise but a continuous improvement program designed to maintain momentum in reducing VAR. Success requires embedding resilience into the organization through mindset, governance structures, management processes, capabilities, and enabling technologies.

Companies that succeed establish a cross-functional project management office to monitor progress and lift roadblocks, ensuring organizational success factors are implemented in parallel with technical solutions. Automation is critical to ensure efficient reassessment aligned with annual budget cycles and updates to global climate models.

“This is not just about compliance – it is about safeguarding assets, operations and growth in a changing climate,” said Gerhard Bolt, principal at dss+. “Organizations that adopt this structured approach will not only reduce risk but also unlock competitive advantage through resilience, cost efficiency and stakeholder confidence.”",https://www.consultancy.eu/illustrations/news/spotlight/2025-12-16-092454619-Mastering_climate_risk_dss__framework_sets_out_a_10-step_approach_2.jpg?webp,N,,2025-12-16 10:58:13.859475

This came during the ninth edition of Al-Ahram’s Energy Conference, where he gave the breakdown of the figure, noting that Italy’s energy giant Eni will invest $8 bn, the UK-based bp will inject $5 bn, and the remaining $3.7 billion will be provided by ARCIUS Energy (a joint venture between bp and ADNOC’s subsidiary XRG).

The minister boasted the fact that the petroleum sector has shifted from a period of decline to a phase of stability, with natural gas production increasing gradually for the first time in four years, and the crude oil output is projected to achieve self-sufficiency within five years.

The petroleum ministry has implemented a series of measures to stimulate upstream activity, including paying nearly $1 billion of arrears to IOCs, introducing new investment incentives, and revising production-sharing agreements to include the R-Factor system.

These reforms have encouraged foreign investors to expand their operations, leading to multiple discoveries across Egypt, the most recent of which are: North El-Basant 1 exploratory well, which contains initial reserves of 15–25 billion cubic feet (bcf) and the Northeast Ramadan Crystal (NER-1X) well, with output estimated at 8 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscf/d) in the Nile Delta region.

The ministry launched a Red Sea international bid round via Egypt Upstream Gateway (EUG), available until Sunday 3rd of May 2026 at 12:00 PM. This is in addition to plans to drill 480 exploration wells over the next five years, alongside expanding seismic surveys covering 100,000 square kilometers onshore the Western Desert in addition to 95,000 square kilometers offshore the Eastern Mediterranean using Ocean Bottom Node (OBN) technology.

During the conference, Badawi highlighted the ministry’s plan to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and boost investment opportunities in green energy projects, including Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), green ammonia, and bioethanol

In December, Qatar committed $200 million to build a SAF production facility in the Ain Sokhna Integrated Zone, the first Qatari industrial investment in the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE), which will convert cooking oils into 200,000 tons per year (t/y) of hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), biopropane, and bionaphtha.

The strategy emphasises clean cooking, cross-border energy trading, energy efficiency, innovation, and capacity development, setting the foundation for multi-billion-dollar investments across African countries, according to a statement the pan African bloc seen by APA on Tuesday.

The strategy was launched at the African Energy Efficiency Conference (AfEEC) that was concluded over late last week following the adoption of a communique requiring a collective commitment of AU member states to advancing energy efficiency initiatives across the electricity, industry, buildings, transport, agriculture and household appliances sub-sectors.

The conference highlighted that Africa’s target set out in the AfEES to increase the continent’s energy productivity by 50 percent by 2050 and 70 percent by 2063 as part of the global pledge to double energy efficiency improvements by 2030.

Speaking at the event, AU Commission Chairperson Mahmoud Ali Youssouf emphasised the deep energy paradox for resource-rich Africa, where 600 million people lack electricity and 900 million still rely on biomass.

Energy efficiency is Africa’s first line of defense against energy poverty, capable of boosting productivity and cutting energy costs, Youssouf said, calling for urgent action to overcome the triple dilemma of energy security, affordability, and regional connectivity.

“Every kilowatt-hour wasted is a school not electrified, a vaccine not safely stored, a business not powered, or a job not created. Energy efficiency is an economic shield, an environmental safeguard, and a strategic pathway to securing Africa’s energy future,” said Chairperson Youssouf.

The chairperson further underscored a unified political will to build a reliable, interconnected, and future-ready energy system for all Africans.

2025 Reflections

Policy: 2025 was a pivotal year for the mandatory SAF compliance market in Europe. The blending targets under the UK SAF Mandate and EU's ReFuelEU came into effect, imposing (for the first time) a minimum 2% SAF blending requirement on aviation fuel suppliers with penalties for failing to meet the mandatory threshold.

Supply and demand: Regulation has therefore clearly boosted SAF demand in 2025. The market has largely been supplied by existing production of HEFA-derived SAF (i.e. first generation biofuels derived from used cooking oils, animal fats and vegetable oils). Notwithstanding this, the UK national average blending was still trending below the 2% requirement and the surging SAF price seen towards the latter half of the year (by more than 50% in recent weeks) signals that suppliers are scrambling to obtain available supply on the spot market to avoid a shortfall against the mandatory requirements.

Ongoing challenges: However, despite the implementation of the SAF blending mandates, announcements of construction of new SAF plants has been sluggish. The perception that HEFA-based SAF will be oversupplied through the rest of the decade may have resulted in delayed procurement. In the short term, this may have proved unwise and will lead to a change of behaviour as obligations mount. In addition, there have been other core challenges faced by SAF producers in securing third-party investment and getting their projects to FID.

Lack of FIDs: Such challenges include the funding of large upfront DevEx costs (often without a clear line of sight on FID), securing long-term offtake arrangements, the price delta between cost of production and the price offtakers/airlines are willing and able to pay (essentially the fossil fuel cost plus a limited green premium) and stable supply of eligible feedstocks. In particular, significant additional investment is needed to ensure increased SAF supply from PtL/e-SAF, noting the e-fuel sub-mandates that will take effect from 2028 in the UK and 2030 in the EU.

First steps government financial support to industry in Europe: The UK government's intention to implement a revenue certainty mechanism to support long-term SAF offtake at a guaranteed price commenced the legislative process with the introduction of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill into the House of Commons in May 2025. A summary of the proposed bill, its legislative readings and key points arising from Parliamentary debates was published in August 2025 and is available here. The Bill is expected to be passed by the end of 2026. The UK's Advanced Fuel Fund also awarded £63 million across 17 SAF projects in 2025 in an effort to assist with high upfront development costs and accelerate SAF production. In the EU, the European Commission published its Sustainable Transport Investment Plan in November 2025 (STIP) which promised increased capital for grant funding for SAF projects and signposted plans to launch an EU-wide double-sided auction for second and third generation SAFs. A summary of proposed measures can be read here. In November 2025, the EU's Innovation Fund also announced €2.9 billion in grant funding to 61 net-zero technology projects. Four of the winning projects are for e-SAF production. Both the UK and EU have therefore shown strong regulatory commitment to the acceleration of SAF production.

Book and claim: The voluntary SAF market also continued to grow alongside the compliance market, with airlines, airports and corporate travellers committing to their own decarbonisation goals, pushing demand in excess of the mandatory requirements. Book and claim models (which decouple the physical fuel from its environmental benefits) emerge on the voluntary market as corporations seek to obtain the environmental attributes of SAF (without purchasing the physical fuel itself). The launch of the IATA SAF Registry was a critical logistical milestone for the industry, providing the essential Book & Claim transparency framework needed for global corporate offtakers and to reduce double-counting risks. Book & Claim is seen as a key near-term mechanism to overcome infrastructure bottlenecks by enabling greater SAF production in the most efficient locations, the environmental benefits of which can be claimed in locations where SAF production/access is less feasible.

2026 Outlook

Project FIDs: To meet mandated 2030 demand targets, an estimated 5.8 Mt of additional capacity must secure Final Investment Decision (FID) in 2026 and 2027. It is essential that the pathfinder projects awarded grant funding the EU and the UK start to take steps towards FID, in order to come online in time for the ramping-up of the blending mandates in 2030. Lack of scalable alternative SAF production by the end of the decade threatens to make the mandates for e-SAF impossible to achieve and add penalty costs to suppliers.

Supply and demand: Expect HEFA to meet market demand for 2026.

Regulatory: The European Commission is required to review and assess the effectiveness of the EU ETS in 2026. It is anticipated that, as part of this review, the EC will extend the allocation of free SAF allowances to continue to support the scale-up of the SAF industry. The UK Revenue Certainty Mechanism will be progressed and we expect advancements to be made on support measures identified in the STIP.

Airlines, suppliers, producers and lenders grapple with new offtake models: Traditional offtake structures which have underpinned the financing of large power and fuels projects previously will be re-moulded to adapt to the market dynamics of the jet fuel supply industry. A certain level of market risk may be borne by projects which will impact on the debt capacity of those projects and ultimately the production cost of SAF.

Technological evolution: Spurred by strong regulatory support and a tightening of feedstock supply for HEFA, expect investment to continue to come into technologies to lower costs to unlock scalable feedstocks such as agricultural waste, forestry residues and municipal solid waste as well as PtL/e-SAF, without which the mandates will be challenging to meet.

As leading players in their fields, the airline and the logistics concern both support the development and commercialization of the synthetic aviation fuels manufactured by the Swiss-based Synhelion clean-tech company. One key pillar in this support is the two partners’ long-term commitment to purchase such fuels, which gives Synhelion a sound planning foundation to scale up its synthetic fuel production.

Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS), which is Switzerland’s premium air carrier, and Kuehne+Nagel, which is one of the world’s leading logistics service providers, are to deepen their strategic partnership to make air transportation more sustainable. The partners have signed a Memorandum of Understanding under which they will join forces on various sustainability projects, with a particular focus on new technologies that will bring greater efficiency and sustainability to the transportation sector.

At the heart of the collaboration is the partners’ shared commitment to the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) which is being developed by Synhelion, the Swiss-based clean-tech pioneer. SWISS, its Swiss WorldCargo airfreight division and Kuehne+Nagel will be jointly supporting the scaling up of this fuel technology. A first milestone has already been achieved here in the partners’ long-term undertaking to procure SAF, which gives fuel manufacturers such as Synhelion the planning foundation they need to scale up their SAF production and further develop their technologies.

Through their use of SAF, SWISS and Kuehne+Nagel will also be making a direct contribution to bringing greater sustainability to the transportation sector. SWISS will procure at least 200 tonnes of Synhelion SAF a year under their new commitment and resell a portion thereof to Kuehne+Nagel.

Partnerships promote SAF development

“Sustainable aviation fuels are a key element in our endeavors to make air transportation more sustainable,” stresses SWISS CEO Jens Fehlinger. “These fuels are still expensive and in short supply, however, which is why we need strong partners to help further their development. We’re delighted that, together with Kuehne+Nagel, we can now initiate the first commercial supplies of Synhelion’s synthetic fuel. This is a major step forward, and a clear confirmation of the active role that SWISS aims to play in this vital area.”

Under the new commitment, Kuehne+Nagel will use Synhelion’s SAF for its airfreight transports with Swiss WorldCargo for a five-year period from 2027 onwards. In doing so, Kuehne+Nagel will continue its consistent endeavors to help decarbonize the logistics sector, and will also enable its airfreight customers to sustainably reduce their own carbon footprint.

“To meet the aviation industry’s climate targets, we must scale the production of synthetic SAF. At Kuehne+Nagel, we are taking the lead by partnering with SWISS and Synhelion to accelerate these technologies, making them economically viable,” explains Yngve Ruud, Member of the Management Board responsible for Air Logistics. “With it, we can offer our customers the opportunity to reduce their environmental footprint with this innovative technology.”

SWISS continues to pursue a range of measures to reduce the carbon dioxide produced through its flight operations. Along with investments in advanced and fuel-efficient aircraft, sustainable aviation fuels are a key lever in lowering the air transport industry’s carbon emissions. SWISS has been working for many years now with the Lufthansa Group, further partners and its customers to promote the development of such fuels and the scaling up of their production.",https://content.presspage.com/uploads/3111/6ad41e57-c06f-4d31-bea3-fe4c9620b89b/cf1920_synhelion_swiss.jpg?43674,N,,2025-12-16 06:58:55.024588

A 200 Million USD Agreement

According to the Egyptian government, a contract has been signed with the Qatari conglomerate Al Mana Holding for an initial investment of $200 million dedicated to the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at Ain Sokhna, on the Red Sea. This is the first phase of an industrial project that will be rolled out in three stages across a total area of 100,000 m² within the Suez Canal Economic Zone.

A flagship project in Ain Sokhna

The plant will be located in the Sokhna Integrated Zone, with some of the facilities directly connected to the port to facilitate exports. Ultimately, the site will include a 70,000 m² industrial zone and a 30,000 m² port area, making it one of the region’s leading hubs for sustainable fuels.

Green fuel from used cooking oil

The project aims to produce sustainable aviation fuel from used cooking oil, following a circular economy model and promoting waste recovery. The first phase is announced with an annual capacity of approximately 200,000 tons, including SAF (Suez Fuzzy Air), but also co-products such as bio-propane and bio-nafta derived from the refining of these oils.

Egypt positions itself in SAF

This partnership with Al Mana Holding comes as Egypt is multiplying its initiatives to develop a local SAF industry, notably through a first sustainable aviation fuel project in Alexandria led by the Egyptian Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company and using Honeywell UOP technology. The country hopes to thus comply with new international regulations that mandate a gradual increase in the share of sustainable fuels in aviation, while also addressing its CO₂ emissions.

A lever for Egypt-Qatar relations

For Cairo, this investment marks the first Qatari industrial presence in the Suez Canal Economic Zone and symbolizes a new dynamism in the bilateral relationship following the diplomatic reconciliation of the 2017-2021 period. The project comes on top of other major announcements, including a vast Qatari program of nearly $30 billion in real estate and tourism on the Egyptian Mediterranean coast, confirming the strong return of Gulf capital to the country’s economy.",https://capmad.lon1.digitaloceanspaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Qatar-Egypt_-200-Million-USD-for-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-1080x1080-minia_blog_square_web-en.webp,N,,2025-12-16 06:59:16.697826
