It’s a compelling example of how aviation innovation can extend far beyond air travel and directly serve planet-positive business goals.","Aviation is under pressure to clean up its act, and fast. The industry’s flagship climate tool, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), is already faltering. A new report has revealed that only one project has issued carbon credits eligible under CORSIA rules. That’s a startling supply crunch for a scheme meant to help airlines hit emissions targets by purchasing offsets, especially as international flights ramp back up post-pandemic. With the voluntary carbon market (VCM) unable to keep pace, airlines could be flying into a serious climate credibility gap.

CORSIA was never meant to be the entire solution. But this shortfall underscores a deeper truth: Aviation can’t offset its way out to sustainability. Airlines and aircraft manufacturers need viable, scalable ways to reduce emissions at the source.

And while policy lags and viable jet fuel alternatives remain limited, the innovation pipeline tells a more hopeful story: A surge of new technologies is reimagining a sustainable future for aviation. Many are still early stage, but they point to a future where the need for offsets shrinks, not grows.

Here are five standout solutions helping aviation cut emissions. Each one tackles the problem from a different angle – and together, they offer a glimpse of what cleaner flight could look like.

Ceramic fuel cells powered by liquid sodium could unlock electric flight

Image credit: Gretchen Ertl

A team at MIT has developed a liquid sodium metal fuel cell designed to overcome one of electric aviation’s biggest hurdles: battery weight.

Instead of using traditional, rechargeable batteries, this system runs on inexpensive liquid sodium and could deliver more than three times the energy density of current lithium-ion tech. The goal? Make electric aircraft feasible for commercial use, without the heavy baggage of today’s battery limitations.

How it works

The system is built around a solid ceramic electrolyte that separates liquid sodium fuel from ambient air. Oxygen from the air reacts with sodium ions that pass through the membrane, producing electricity in the process. Unlike batteries, there’s no need for recharging – just refuel with more sodium. That makes the setup not only lighter and more energy-dense, but also safer, since the two reactive components are separated and one of them (air) is non-combustible. The prototype is currently small, but scalable, and is being further developed by a startup called Propel Aero based at The Engine – MIT’s innovation hub.

Why climate-conscious brands should care

Aviation consumed around 99 billion gallons of fossil fuel in 2024 alone and remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. If this technology scales, it could help phase out fossil jet fuel entirely for short- and medium-haul flights. That’s a major opportunity for climate-focused companies – whether it’s greening business travel, decarbonizing supply chains, or investing in breakthrough tech. It’s not just a fuel cell; it’s a potential route to net-zero aviation.

Turning waste polystyrene into a critical SAF ingredient

Image credit: Fred Zwicky

Researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have developed a method to convert waste polystyrene – the kind found in packaging and containers – into ethylbenzene, a key aromatic hydrocarbon used in aviation fuel.

Aromatics make up 8-25 percent of jet fuel and are essential for ensuring proper combustion and sealing within fuel systems. Sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) often lack sufficient aromatics, limiting their use. This breakthrough could help unlock safer, more scalable SAF blends.

How it works

The process relies on thermal pyrolysis, where polystyrene is heated and broken down into a styrene-rich liquid. The team then adds hydrogen to the mix, producing crude ethylbenzene. After distillation, the result is a product that’s 90 percent pure and performs just as well as fossil-derived alternatives when blended with SAF.

Even more impressively, a lifecycle analysis shows a 50-60 percent reduction in emissions compared to petroleum-based ethylbenzene. It’s also cheaper to make.

Yes, it’s still at the lab stage; but the team is aiming to scale to continuous pilot operations and is building partnerships for waste-stream sourcing and sorting to ensure a steady supply of low-cost feedstock.

Why climate-conscious brands should care

This innovation checks multiple boxes: waste reduction, emissions savings and better SAF performance. For companies relying on air freight or business travel, it offers a real pathway to lower-carbon aviation. And for brands working toward circularity goals, it’s a powerful reminder that today’s trash could fuel tomorrow’s transport, literally.

Scaling up next-gen SAFs with ‘Aerobrew’

Image credit: Metafuels

Swiss startup Metafuels is pioneering a new process to produce synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (e-SAF) at scale, using a system it calls ‘Aerobrew.’ While SAF has long been recognized as a key to decarbonizing aviation, high costs and low production volumes have held it back. Metafuels’ approach aims to deliver a higher-yield, lower-cost alternative that could replace fossil jet fuel without modifications to existing aircraft.

How it works

The Aerobrew process begins by combining green hydrogen – produced through renewably powered electrolysis – with captured CO₂, sourced from technologies such as direct air capture. These inputs are used to synthesize green methanol, which is then converted into SAF. Unlike other SAF production methods, Aerobrew maximizes conversion efficiency from methanol to jet fuel, which significantly boosts yield and reduces production costs.

The result is a drop-in fuel that works across all aircraft types, with no need for changes to engines or infrastructure. Backed by $22 million in funding, including a recent $5 million grant from the Swiss Government, Metafuels is now moving toward commercial scale. A newly announced facility in Denmark, built in partnership with European Energy, is expected to produce 12,000 litres of e-SAF per day.

Why climate-conscious brands should care

Aviation emissions are rising fast, and SAF remains one of the most promising tools to counter them. But scalability is the sticking point. Metafuels offers a real-world path to volume production of SAF, powered by renewables and carbon capture. For brands with global operations, freight logistics or ambitious climate targets, this innovation could enable cleaner skies without waiting decades for electric or hydrogen planes to arrive.

Using AI flight planning to stop planet-warming contrails

Image credit: chamillewhite

Contrails – those familiar white streaks trailing behind jets – are a surprisingly potent climate threat. They trap heat in the atmosphere and are responsible for up to 60 percent of aviation’s climate impact. Until recently, avoiding them was considered too complex. But UK-based climate tech startup Satavia is proving otherwise. Its DECISIONX platform uses AI to help airlines plan flight paths that avoid contrail formation – cutting emissions without requiring new fuels or hardware.

How it works

Satavia’s system draws on high-resolution weather forecasting, aircraft performance data and atmospheric modeling to predict where and when contrails are likely to form. Built on its 5-DX digital twin of the atmosphere, DECISIONX lets airlines reroute or adjust altitude just slightly – sometimes by as little as a few hundred feet – to avoid the narrow atmospheric bands where contrails form. These minor tweaks can prevent warming.

Importantly, the platform also quantifies the climate impact of these changes – allowing airlines to validate and monetize contrail avoidance by converting it into future carbon-equivalent units, tradable on the VCM. It’s already in use: Etihad Airways has signed a multi-year contract to embed the tech into daily operations.

Why climate-conscious brands should care

This is climate mitigation without compromise – no new aircraft, no major costs; just smarter routing. For companies concerned with Scope 3 emissions from business travel or air freight, supporting contrail prevention could offer measurable reductions in climate impact. It also opens the door to carbon credits backed by science, rather than sometimes-questionable offsets.

Solar-powered, autonomous aircraft for continuous, zero-emission monitoring

Image credit: Radical

US startup Radical has developed a high-altitude, autonomous aircraft designed to fly for months at a time without landing – powered by nothing but sunlight. While conventional aviation emits vast amounts of CO₂, this ultra-lightweight aircraft offers an emissions-free alternative with powerful potential across multiple sectors – from climate monitoring to communications.

How it works

The aircraft is powered by solar panels that charge on-board batteries – enabling autonomous, sustained flight at high altitudes. Unlike satellites, these aircraft can hover over precise areas for extended periods – providing real-time, high-resolution data and coverage. Potential applications include monitoring wildfires, weather systems and illegal activity at sea; as well as acting as a low-orbit platform for mobile and internet connectivity, delivering broadband directly to devices.

Radical’s innovation is not just theoretical. After testing a small prototype in October 2023, the company has raised $4.5 million in seed funding from investors including Scout Ventures and Y Combinator. The next step: a full-scale test flight within the year to validate long-duration performance.

Why climate-conscious brands should care

This isn’t about transporting passengers; it’s about enabling smarter, climate-positive infrastructure. For companies involved in agriculture, conservation, telecoms or ESG reporting, these aircraft could offer persistent, zero-emissions solutions for data gathering and connectivity, at lower cost and higher resolution than traditional satellite systems. It’s a compelling example of how aviation innovation can extend far beyond air travel and directly serve planet-positive business goals.",https://sb-web-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/production/52506/conversions/production-asset-thumb--offsetting-wont-save-aviation-innovation-2025-07-28-82c6b9d7d9b7100ba04c0aa755b4c792-fbimg.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 16:56:33.675371

The Science Behind the Revolution

ESAF represents a breakthrough in sustainable fuel production through Power-to-Liquid (PtL) technology. This innovative process harnesses renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis, then combines the hydrogen with captured carbon dioxide to create liquid hydrocarbons. The result is a drop-in replacement fuel that requires no modifications to existing aircraft or fuel infrastructure.

The technology's appeal lies in its ability to produce fuel from abundant resources while delivering significant environmental benefits. Unlike biofuels that compete with food crops for land, ESAF production relies on atmospheric carbon dioxide and renewable energy, creating a truly sustainable fuel cycle.

Industry Giants Drive Market Expansion

The ESAF market features an impressive lineup of industry leaders working to scale production and deployment. Honeywell has emerged as a technology pioneer with its UOP eFining system, while energy giants like TotalEnergies, BP, and Shell are investing heavily in production facilities.

Market Segmentation and Applications

The ESAF market spans two primary fuel types: sustainable aviation biofuels and sustainable aviation synthetic fuels. Both categories serve critical roles in the decarbonization strategy, with synthetic fuels offering particular advantages in terms of feedstock availability and production scalability.

Application Sector Market Share Growth Driver Civil Aviation Dominant Regulatory compliance & consumer demand Military Aviation Emerging Energy security & operational requirements

Civil aviation remains the primary market driver, with commercial airlines under increasing pressure to meet ambitious carbon reduction targets. Military applications are gaining traction as defense organizations recognize the strategic value of domestically produced, sustainable fuel sources. The dual-use nature of ESAF technology creates opportunities for cross-sector collaboration and shared infrastructure development.

Overcoming Production Challenges

While the ESAF market shows tremendous promise, industry stakeholders are actively addressing production and cost challenges. The high capital requirements for PtL facilities and the need for reliable renewable energy infrastructure represent significant hurdles that companies are working to overcome through technological innovation and strategic partnerships.

Access to renewable electricity remains a critical factor in ESAF production economics. Companies are developing integrated solutions that combine renewable energy generation with fuel production facilities, creating synergies that improve overall project viability. These integrated approaches are expected to drive down production costs and increase supply chain reliability.

The Future Takes Wing

The ESAF market represents a pivotal moment in aviation's sustainability journey, with technology breakthroughs and market dynamics aligning to create unprecedented growth opportunities. As production scales up and costs continue to decline, ESAF is positioned to become a cornerstone of the aviation industry's decarbonization strategy. The convergence of regulatory support, technological advancement, and market demand creates a compelling case for continued investment and development in this transformative fuel technology.

With major industry players committing resources and governments providing policy support, the stage is set for ESAF to fundamentally reshape how the world thinks about sustainable aviation. The next decade will likely see this revolutionary fuel technology transition from niche applications to mainstream adoption, marking a new chapter in clean aviation history.",https://decarbonfuse.com/assets/favi/favicon-32x32-b1c94ae87840c662751403aefa5b6ea92417e97aab4cbce5a1b99c4e112cac36.png,N,,2025-07-28 17:56:41.443050

Pharmaceuticals comprise over 12 percent of India’s total airfreight export value, and nearly 80 percent of this volume demands some form of temperature control, according to IATA.

“The weakest link is no longer airlift—it’s cold chain consistency from shipper to consignee,” observed Bhasker A, Associate Vice President of Engineering and Projects at Sun Pharmaceutical Industries. “GDP-compliant handling and validated lanes are critical if we are to compete with hubs in Europe or Singapore.”

The concern is validated by discrepancies in airport infrastructure across Indian cities. While metro hubs such as Mumbai and Hyderabad have made progress in pharma-certified facilities, regional airports remain under-equipped to handle high-value cold chain cargo, threatening India’s ability to decentralise pharmaceutical exports.

Digital infrastructure as the invisible enabler

A quiet but profound shift is underway in India’s airfreight sector: the digitalisation of cargo processing and inter-agency coordination. Vineet Malhotra, Director at Kale Logistics, explained how Cargo Community Systems (CCS) at key airports have reduced shipment dwell times by 22 percent and streamlined customs-clearance documentation.

This effort aligns with India’s ambition to improve its ranking in the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index (LPI), where it now ranks 38th globally, a significant improvement from its 44th position in 2018.

“Interoperability between forwarders, airlines, ground handlers and customs is no longer aspirational—it’s fundamental,” Malhotra said. “A paperless ecosystem not only improves turnaround time, but reduces regulatory friction and enhances compliance traceability.”

Policy professionals monitoring digital trade facilitation will note that this evolution aligns with broader WTO efforts on Trade Facilitation Agreements (TFA), where data integration and real-time visibility are central to reducing cross-border inefficiencies.

High-Security & Precision Logistics

India’s rise as a hub for high-value, high-security cargo—ranging from banking assets to high-end electronics and jewellery—has triggered innovation in secure logistics services.

“India’s growth story in this segment is limited, not by demand but by scalable and standardised solutions,” said Rajkumar S, CEO of Sequel Logistics, a market leader in secure logistics. “We’re witnessing a strong uptick in inter-city express movement, especially among banking and bullion sectors.”

Sequel’s model, built on vault-to-vault tracking, temperature integrity, and end-to-end risk management, represents a critical edge in markets where data security, chain of custody, and audit trails are under increasing scrutiny.

Decentralisation: Beyond Metro-Centric Growth

While India’s six major metro airports account for nearly 80 percent of airfreight throughput, speakers at the panel urged policymakers to focus on capacity-building across Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, especially as Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes decentralise manufacturing.

“India’s cargo growth will be driven not just by volumes, but by regional inclusivity,” stated Himanshu Pant, Managing Director & CEO of MGH Group. “We must incentivise the development of smaller cargo terminals and multimodal linkages in the hinterland.”

The success of regional air connectivity schemes like UDAN and the viability of smaller freighter operations will depend heavily on how India integrates cargo-specific incentives into regional airport modernisation plans.

Institutional execution remains a bottleneck

Despite strong policy ambition, experts cautioned that execution gaps remain—particularly around the National Air Cargo Policy Blueprint (2019), which remains largely unimplemented. Industry professionals highlighted the need for harmonised policy across ministries, centralised stakeholder coordination, and enforceable service-level benchmarks.

“India is at the cusp of a logistics revolution—but unless we institutionalise governance, standardisation, and training, we risk squandering the opportunity,” noted moderator Ramesh Mamidala, Head of Cargo at Air India.

A framework akin to the European Union’s Single Window Environment for Customs (EU SW-CERTEX), or a cross-sector regulatory authority for cargo, could help India accelerate execution while reducing regulatory fragmentation.

Implications for Global Trade and Sustainability

India’s airfreight expansion intersects with broader global challenges—particularly supply chain resilience, decarbonisation mandates, and digital trade compliance. With the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and Fit for 55 proposals reshaping trade regulation, operators in India will need to adapt quickly to sustainability reporting, carbon footprint tracking, and green fuel adoption.

“We need visibility not just of cargo, but of carbon,” said one panel participant. “India must develop its SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) strategy in lockstep with trade policy, or risk being excluded from future air corridors with green mandates.”

In this context, India’s airfreight policy must be better integrated with its climate strategy, trade agreements, and aviation decarbonisation targets to ensure compliance and competitiveness.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Page-9-shutterstock_1936631263-1080x724.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 14:56:08.481501

As part of the agreement with Japan, Japan will increase the quota for rice imports and has committed to purchasing $8 billion worth of U.S. goods. Although details are few, the EU and United States reached a framework deal over the weekend that may lower some tariffs on agricultural goods.

Reports indicate the United States and EU will have zero-for-zero tariffs on some agricultural products. The tariff rates for wine and spirits are not yet established. The remaining tariff level will be set at 15%, up from the 10% bar reset on April 9 and in line with the other renegotiated deals in recent weeks. National Grain and Feed Association President and CEO Mike Seyfert said this is a “meaningful step forward in opening one of the world’s most restrictive markets to American producers.” Seyfert added NGFA is “encouraged by the president’s call to diversify agricultural trade with the EU, and we look forward to ongoing discussions to build on that goal.”

Japan is expected to immediately increase imports of U.S. rice by 75%, representing a major expansion of import quotas. In addition, the framework establishes Japan will purchase $8 billion in U.S. goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol and sustainable aviation fuel.

In the 2023-24 marketing year, Japan was the second largest importer of U.S. corn; the third largest importer of U.S. sorghum; the fourth largest importer of U.S. barley; and the ninth largest importer of U.S. distillers dried grains with solubles, totaling 14 million metric tons in corn-equivalent exports or $5.95 billion, the U.S. Grains Council shared. “This deal is an embodiment of our countries’ longstanding partnership and includes ethanol and SAF that fits into Japan’s policies of increasing the use of renewable fuels, that include U.S. ethanol,” said USGC President and CEO Ryan LeGrand.

USA Rice President and CEO Peter Bachmann added, “Japan is consistently among our top export markets in terms of both value and volume, but this will be the first opportunity since the 1990s to further that market access.” From 1999 to 2024, Japan imported an annual average of 326,828 MT of U.S. rice, valued at approximately $222.7 million per year (not adjusted for inflation). U.S. rice that enters Japan outside the tariff rate quota system faces a tariff of 341 yen per kilogram, which in U.S. dollars is roughly $2.33 per kg or $2,330 per MT, USA Rice reported.

The framework with Indonesia also addresses non-tariff barriers for U.S. agriculture. Specifically, Indonesia will address and prevent barriers to U.S. agricultural products in the Indonesian market, including by: (1) exempting U.S. food and agricultural products from all of Indonesia’s import licensing regimes including its commodity balance policy; (2) ensuring transparency and fairness with respect to geographical indications including meats and cheeses; (3) providing permanent Fresh Food of Plant Origin (FFPO) designation for all applicable U.S. plant products; and (4) recognizing U.S. regulatory oversight, including listing of all U.S. meat, poultry and dairy facilities and accepting certificates issued by U.S. regulatory authorities.

While U.S. soybeans and soy products already enjoyed duty-free access into the market, the framework also announced a commitment from Indonesia to purchase $4.5 billion worth of U.S. agricultural products, including soybeans and soybean meal. In marketing year 2023/2024, Indonesia imported $1.23 billion of U.S. soybean products, making the country U.S. soy’s fifth largest trading partner by volume according to USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service.

The Trump administration is preparing a list of agricultural products to be exempt from reciprocal tariffs. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has been assembling a list of raw commodities that are not produced in the states to “shape bilateral trade talks and potentially offer tariff relief for U.S. importers,” according to Agri-Pulse. If the exemptions materialize, importers could see some relief for products such as fruit, vegetables, seafood, coffee, cocoa, some seed oils and other critical inputs for food manufacturers. Some sources say the list of raw materials and agricultural goods could be incorporated into country-specific trade agreements, like those the president has made with the UK, Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines and Japan.",https://grainnet-com.s3.amazonaws.com/defaults/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/GJ_default_image_1200x630.webp?mtime=1708746861,N,,2025-07-28 14:23:29.371855

Yet, despite achieving a modest increase in revenue, the airline’s net profit for the first quarter of 2025 has suffered a sharp decline of 59%. The reasons behind this decline include lower interest income, the underperformance of its partner, Air India, and intensifying competition in the aviation sector. This financial setback carries significant implications not just for the airline itself, but for the broader tourism and travel industry in Southeast Asia and beyond.

The SIA Group reported a total revenue of S$4.79 billion, a slight rise from the previous year’s S$4.72 billion, yet its operating profit slipped by 13.8%. The steep drop in profits raises several concerns about the economic pressures faced by the aviation sector, which has seen a notable shift due to volatile market conditions and increasing competition. For tourists planning to travel across Southeast Asia, these changes are bound to affect the landscape of air travel, and by extension, tourism as a whole.

Airlines and the Future of Tourism: The Ripple Effect

The relationship between airlines and tourism is inextricable. As global tourism continues to rebound, airlines, particularly in regions like Southeast Asia, are vital in making destinations accessible to travelers. The profitability of major airlines like Singapore Airlines has direct consequences on travel pricing, availability of flights, and the overall travel experience. A decline in airline profits could signal the possibility of reduced flight frequencies, higher fares, and less competition in certain sectors.

SIA’s passenger numbers, however, paint a more optimistic picture. The group carried a record 10.27 million passengers in Q1 FY2025/26, marking a 6.9% increase from the previous year. The high demand for air travel despite the financial struggles faced by the airline reflects the resilience of Southeast Asia’s tourism sector, where travel is still booming.

However, this growth comes at a cost. SIA’s passenger yields, which represent the average fare paid per mile flown by each passenger, fell by 2.9%. This decline indicates a more competitive environment in which customers may struggle to find affordable tickets, potentially deterring tourists from traveling as frequently or to farther destinations. The concern here is not just about higher ticket prices but also the reduced availability of budget-friendly travel options that appeal to price-conscious tourists, particularly in the leisure and mid-range segments.

The Air India Factor: How Partnerships Affect Tourism

One of the most significant contributors to SIA’s profit decline is its partnership with Air India, particularly after Air India fully integrated Vistara, which was previously partially owned by SIA. The decision to account for Air India’s financial performance as part of its own balance sheet has significantly impacted SIA’s profits, largely due to Air India’s losses. This, in turn, affects the travel plans of many passengers, especially those considering routes that involve multiple airlines under the same partnership.

With the growing dominance of Air India in the South Asian market, the fall of SIA’s profits could slow the progress of joint ventures and collaborations in the region, potentially reducing the number of travel routes or destinations offered by these carriers. For tourists, especially those traveling between Southeast Asia and South Asia, this could mean fewer choices in flights, possibly leading to higher costs or less direct routes. This could affect travel itineraries, particularly for business travelers and leisure tourists heading to destinations like India, Malaysia, and Thailand, where airlines like SIA play a key role in the tourism infrastructure.

Tourism Growth Amid Financial Struggles

Despite the financial setbacks, both Singapore Airlines and its low-cost subsidiary, Scoot, achieved all-time high passenger numbers. The high load factors (the proportion of available seats filled with passengers) of 86.6% for Singapore Airlines and 91.5% for Scoot illustrate that demand for air travel remains robust, even in the face of financial uncertainty. This is particularly important for tourism, as airlines are a primary vehicle for both inbound and outbound travelers in the region.

However, the lower passenger yields paint a concerning picture for the tourism industry. These falling yields, caused by increased competition from other carriers adding more capacity, could result in higher operational costs. Airlines may respond by passing these costs onto customers, particularly tourists who are already facing rising prices for accommodations, activities, and other travel expenses.

On the other hand, the strong performance in passenger volumes provides optimism for the future. Tourists continue to flock to destinations across Asia, and Singapore remains a central hub for international travelers, offering access to key regional destinations such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The travel demand in the region is likely to continue, albeit with a cautionary note about pricing.

The Future of Air Travel and Tourism in Southeast Asia

Singapore Airlines’ strong network, including recent expansions in destinations like Iloilo in the Philippines and Vienna in Austria for Scoot, signals that the company is actively exploring new growth opportunities. This is vital not only for the airline’s recovery but also for the sustainability of tourism in the region. Expanding networks and increasing capacity to high-demand destinations help mitigate some of the potential negative impacts caused by economic fluctuations.

Moreover, the group’s partnership with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) suppliers such as Neste and World Energy demonstrates its commitment to sustainability, a critical consideration for tourists who are increasingly concerned with the environmental impact of their travels. With sustainability becoming a more prominent factor in the travel decisions of consumers, airlines that prioritize eco-friendly practices may be better positioned to maintain loyalty from environmentally-conscious travelers.

Additionally, the airline’s strategic initiatives to counterbalance market fluctuations, such as increasing capacity on Asian routes following the closure of Jetstar Asia, could help provide stability in the tourism sector. This will be particularly beneficial for tourists looking for budget-friendly travel options and for countries in the region dependent on international tourism as a key driver of their economy.

Financial Health and Resilience Amid Challenges

Despite the profit decline, the SIA Group remains in a strong financial position. The group’s balance sheet shows a solid equity base of S$15.8 billion, a reduction in debt, and a healthy cash balance of S$7.8 billion. These financial strengths provide the group with the resilience needed to weather the ongoing economic uncertainties, positioning it well for future growth.

For the tourism industry, this strong financial backing is a sign of stability. It suggests that, despite short-term financial challenges, Singapore Airlines will continue to be a major player in the Southeast Asian travel landscape. This is important for both tourists and businesses that rely on the airline’s vast network for logistics and transportation.

Conclusion: Looking Ahead to a Robust Travel Landscape

While the recent decline in Singapore Airlines’ profits raises concerns about the future of air travel and tourism in Southeast Asia, the airline’s commitment to passenger growth, sustainability, and expanding its network offers a promising outlook. The robust demand for air travel, combined with SIA’s strategic efforts to navigate economic uncertainties, ensures that the region’s tourism industry will remain resilient.

The key takeaway for travelers and industry professionals is that while challenges persist, the tourism sector in Southeast Asia remains strong. Tourists will likely continue to flock to popular destinations such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand, with airlines adapting to meet these demands. The ongoing investments in infrastructure, sustainability, and route expansions demonstrate that the tourism and travel industries are resilient and will continue to thrive, albeit with careful navigation through uncertain economic times.

The deal slashes tariffs on Japanese vehicles, opens Japanese markets to U.S. energy and agriculture, and commits a staggering $550 billion in Japanese investment into the U.S. economy.

Investors are already seeing the impact: Japanese auto stocks jumped double digits on the news. But the ripple effects go way beyond Toyota and Honda… and the smartest investors are positioning now for the next wave of winners.

Let’s break down what’s in this deal, who stands to gain, and how to play it.

What’s actually in the deal?

Here’s the quick breakdown:

Lower tariffs: Japanese autos entering the U.S. will now face a flat 15% tariff—a big drop from the ~27.5% originally threatened.

Massive Japanese investment: Japan pledged $550 billion for U.S. industries, including semiconductors, energy, shipbuilding, and AI.

Market access for U.S. agriculture and energy: Japan will expand U.S. rice imports by 75%, and buy more corn, soybeans, fertilizer, and even sustainable aviation fuel.

Technology and supply chain collaboration: The deal gives U.S. companies better access to Japan’s high-tech industries—like AI, semiconductors, and robotics—while allowing Japanese firms to take part in U.S. supply chain reshoring. It’s a two-way partnership aimed at reducing reliance on China and strengthening critical industries in both countries.

Who’s already winning (and losing)?

The biggest pop came in Japanese automakers, which suddenly got cheaper access to the U.S. market. These companies now enjoy a huge cost advantage over U.S. automakers—at least in the near term.

Toyota (TM), Honda (HMC), Nissan (NSANY), and Mazda (MZDAY) all surged within hours of the news.

Sony Group (SONY) also rallied thanks to its heavy electronics and supply chain exposure.

Unfortunately for Ford (F) and General Motors (GM), this deal makes Japanese cars more competitive in the U.S. market—right when Ford and GM are still struggling to manage EV costs and shifting supply chains.

GM and Ford now face a major disadvantage. They’ll eventually have to bring more manufacturing back to the U.S.—but that takes time and money. Until then, their margins will lag while Japanese automakers sell cheaper.

But this isn’t just about cars. The $550 billion Japanese investment package targets strategic sectors:

Semiconductors and critical minerals – bolstering supply chains and advanced manufacturing

Energy and shipbuilding – more U.S. LNG, sustainable aviation fuel, and maritime projects

AI and advanced tech – joint development and IP-sharing opportunities

U.S. agriculture – expanded rice, soybean, corn, and fertilizer exports

Think of it as a two-way street: Japanese exports (like cars and electronics) gain a smoother path to U.S. consumers… while U.S. companies get better access to Japanese demand for energy, food, and technology.

And there’s another recurring winner from deals like this: Boeing (BA).

Why? Because trade deals often use big-ticket purchases, such as airplanes, to balance deficits. Japan is expected to boost its orders of U.S.-made aircraft… which will send Boeing soaring.

The next trade deal catalysts

Japan is just the first in a series of deals coming ahead of the August 1 deadline.

Two under-the-radar countries that could become our next trade partners: Cambodia and Bangladesh.

Why does that matter? Because those countries are massive apparel exporters. If the U.S. signs favorable trade deals with them, Gap (GPS), Levi Strauss (LEVI), Ralph Lauren (RL), and PVH Corp (PVH) could see a 10–15% pop, similar to what we just saw with Japanese automakers.

So keep an eye on these future negotiations—they could trigger the next round of trade-related stock surges.

How to play it

Here’s a simple roadmap for investors:

Go long Japanese exporters: Toyota (TM), Honda (HMC), Nissan (NSANY), Mazda (MZDAY), and Sony (SONY) should continue to benefit from tariff relief and stronger U.S. demand.

Avoid Ford and GM for now: Both face cost and pricing disadvantages until they relocate more production domestically.

Own Boeing as a recurring trade-deal winner: BA often sees orders tied to major bilateral deals.

Watch apparel stocks for the next wave: Gap (GPS), Levi’s (LEVI), Ralph Lauren (RL), and PVH Corp (PVH) could surge if apparel-heavy countries sign similar deals.

The big picture

This U.S.–Japan deal is more than a tariff tweak—it’s a strategic alignment that unlocks new flows of trade and investment. It rewards companies that can pivot quickly… and punishes those stuck with outdated cost structures.

These deals create immediate pops in the companies most exposed to them. If you can position yourself early—before CNBC starts talking about it—you can ride those 10–20% surges.

And with more countries lining up to negotiate before the August deadline, there’s plenty more opportunity on the horizon.",https://www.curzioresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/us-japan-usd-jpy-800.png,N,,2025-07-28 13:56:15.328176

These reviews may be challenging due to the many variables that affect both cost estimates and real-world outcomes.","The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) plays a vital role in shaping legislation, producing hundreds of cost estimates each year. Lawmakers rely on this scorekeeper to provide impartial analysis. But what happens when those projections miss the mark? A new bill from Rep. Andy Barr (R-KY) aims to answer that question by holding the CBO more accountable when its forecasts fail to match reality.

Barr’s CBO Scoring Accountability Act (H.R.2666) would require the agency to publish follow-up analyses of major legislation after they’ve been enacted into law. This would ensure Congress and the public have a clearer picture of how well CBO estimates hold up once policies are implemented.

There’s often a disconnect between what legislation is projected to cost and what it ends up costing once implemented. CBO’s estimates are not always accurate—and there’s little formal review when reality diverges from projection. Barr’s bill aims to close that gap by requiring CBO to compare original projections to real-world outcomes—helping Congress learn from past mistakes and improve future policymaking.

CBO’s Role in the Budget Process and the Risks of Inaccurate Scores

CBO was established as a neutral budget scorekeeper by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Before this, Congress was generally dependent on the White House’s Office of Management and Budget for fiscal analysis. CBO plays a pivotal role in the development of policy, producing official cost estimates for hundreds of bills each year. In addition, members of Congress and their staff routinely consult with CBO for informal analysis while drafting legislation.

CBO’s estimates play a major role in shaping policy debates, but they are not infallible. Many factors can cause actual fiscal outcomes to diverge from projections, including unexpected economic shifts, policy implementation challenges, and incorrect assumptions. For example, CBO’s dramatic underestimation of the cost of the IRA’s clean energy tax credits and its overestimation of the revenue impact of IRS enforcement funding both illustrate how uncertainty can lead to significant discrepancies between projections and reality.

We at NTUF successfully urged CBO to better highlight uncertainty in its estimates, ensuring that lawmakers and the public have a clearer understanding of the potential range of outcomes. Instead of burying these details deep within explanatory text, CBO now summarizes key points of uncertainty more prominently in its reports, particularly in the sections presenting top-line budgetary impacts. This change helps policymakers better assess the reliability of estimates and recognize when projections might be overly optimistic or pessimistic.

However, these points of uncertainty are often overlooked, and sometimes CBO’s estimates can be significantly off the mark. Understanding that CBO’s scores are well-considered but not infallible will be crucial for having a clear view during this year’s tax debate. Taxpayers should be cautious when analyzing estimates that depend on numerous uncertainties. Here are some of the key misses from CBO in recent years.

Inflation Reduction Act Electric Vehicle Tax Credits

One of the most costly miscalculations in recent memory involves the expansion of the Electric Vehicle (EV) Tax Credit under the so-called Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The law removed a cap on the number of eligible EVs per manufacturer, massively broadening the credit’s reach.

Though originally intended to boost demand, recent research shows that 75% of the credit’s claimants likely would have bought the electric vehicle anyways, meaning the credit functions more as a subsidy than an incentive. But Congress had little idea of the potential price tag, in part because CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) dramatically underestimated the cost.

In 2022, CBO estimated that IRA’s clean vehicle credits would cost around $14 billion over the decade. Revised and follow up estimates range from around $200 billion from CBO, to around $400 billion from the Penn-Wharton Budget Model with some of the overrun tied to a Treasury Department loophole for leased vehicles.

To rein in these runaway costs, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) phases out or eliminates many of the green energy tax credits created under the IRA. This includes repealing the electric vehicle subsidy. OBBBA also rolls back production and investment tax credits for wind and solar, and eliminates credits for clean hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel, advanced manufacturing, and zero-emissions facilities. These reforms are expected to save roughly $500 billion over the next decade.

Medicaid Expansion Flop

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has faced criticism on many fronts, but one of its most costly provisions for taxpayers is the Medicaid expansion. Beginning in 2014, states were permitted to expand their Medicaid coverage to non-elderly, able-bodied adults with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level. When the ACA passed in 2010, the CBO, assuming nationwide adoption, projected sixteen million new enrollees by 2019. Yet by 2019, enrollment in expansion states had already reached fifteen million—even though only about three-fifths of states had implemented the expansion. This is also a huge contributing factor to why the program has been roughly 157% more expensive than anticipated. CBO scored Medicaid expansion repeal at around $800 billion in the ten year budget window back in 2017, which is likely far higher now that additional states have implemented the expansion.

Improving Transparency and Accuracy in Budget Scoring

Budget misses such as these undermine effective policymaking. These cost estimates of enacted laws get included in CBO’s baseline, and, when they are faulty, lead to a skewed outlook of outlays and revenues. More accurate evaluations of major legislation are essential to improving fiscal discipline and accountability.

Under the bill, CBO would assess the actual budgetary effects of such laws and compare them with its original estimates. If actual outcomes diverge from initial projections by more than 10%, CBO must notify Congress and provide an explanation of the discrepancy. The bill also requires federal agencies to cooperate with CBO by supplying data and support necessary for these analyses.

Barr’s bill would build on efforts already undertaken by CBO. For example, it already publishes a variety of recurring reports, such as its ten-year budget and economic outlook and long-term outlook, which include analyses of legislative and economic factors that lead figures to differ from what CBO had previously reported. CBO also regularly examines the accuracy of its baseline. However, these reports do not always dig into the impacts of specific laws.

Barr’s legislation would fill a critical gap by ensuring ongoing reviews of the actual costs of major legislation. These reviews may be challenging due to the many variables that affect both cost estimates and real-world outcomes. However, requiring them would help CBO learn how policies actually unfold and use those insights to improve its future scoring models.

Conclusion

Rep. Barr’s CBO Scoring Accountability Act is a commonsense reform that would strengthen the accuracy and accountability of CBO’s cost estimates—an especially important step following the enactment of sweeping legislation like the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Requiring regular updates on the real-world fiscal impact of major laws will help lawmakers assess whether a policy is working as intended or needs correction. By improving oversight of budget projections, this bill would help ensure more responsible policymaking, provide for improved estimates from CBO, and lead to better outcomes for taxpayers.",https://www.ntu.org/library/imglib/2025/03/CBO.jpeg?v=20250303031100,N,,2025-07-28 13:56:18.081870

In a moment marking the end of an era in aerospace testing, Rolls-Royce officially retired its legendary Boeing 747-200 engine testbed, N787RR, on 9 July 2025.

Stationed at Tucson International Airport, the aircraft concluded nearly two decades of ground-breaking flight trials, leaving behind a legacy that has shaped the evolution of modern jet propulsion, Vintage Aviation News reported.

From testing cutting-edge business jet engines to flying on 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), N787RR became a workhorse of engineering advancement and a symbol of ingenuity in aviation research.

From passenger carrier to flying laboratory

Originally delivered to Cathay Pacific in 1980 as VR-HIA, the aircraft went on to serve with Air Atlanta Icelandic before its transformation by Rolls-Royce began in June 2005. Re-registered as N787RR, the Boeing 747-200 was meticulously refitted into a state-of-the-art flying laboratory. Stripped of passenger seating, the aircraft was equipped with high-tech instrumentation, recording systems, and a distinctive five-engine mounting configuration—allowing it to safely carry and test experimental engines in real-time flight conditions. Its robust four-engine design made it the ideal platform, enabling engineers to evaluate new powerplants without compromising safety.

Pioneering sustainable aviation fuel

The N787RR’s contribution to aerospace went far beyond structural modifications. In October 2021, the aircraft flew a Trent 1000 engine powered entirely by 100% SAF—demonstrating the potential of greener aviation technologies. The aircraft flew from Tucson airport in Arizona, passing over New Mexico and Texas, with a Trent 1000 engine running solely on 100% SAF while the remaining three RB211 engines ran on standard jet fuel.

The three hours and 54 minutes flight, which soared to 43,000 feet, validated the real-world performance and environmental promise of alternative fuels.

Deborah Robinson, Director of Test and Experimental Engineering at Rolls-Royce, described the aircraft as “a great asset to us… we can take the opportunity to test the corners of the flight envelope and feed back into our extensive models.”

Testing the future: The Pearl 10X

Two years later, the N787RR entered another pivotal chapter as the testbed for Rolls-Royce’s Pearl 10X engine, destined for the Dassault Falcon 10X business jet. Beginning in March 2024, a series of high-altitude flights validated critical systems—ranging from fan vibration characteristics to in-flight relight capabilities. By mid-2024, at least ten test flights had been completed, with data gathered helping accelerate certification timelines and enhance engine reliability ahead of service entry.

Challenges of an ageing airframe

Despite these impressive achievements, age eventually caught up with the aircraft. Approaching 45 years of service, N787RR faced mounting maintenance and operational costs. With an average of 25 test flights per year, each sortie required increasing logistical support to maintain airworthiness.

A promising plan shelved

Rolls-Royce had once planned to replace the 747-200 with a newer 747-400 variant, registered as N747RR and acquired from Qantas in 2019. But that project was ultimately shelved in 2022 due to the global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Rolls-Royce invested £56 million ($94 million) in the acquisition and refurbishment of the aircraft. This is in addition to a £90 million investment in Testbed 80 in Derby, described by the company as “the largest and most intelligent testbed in the world.”

The 747-400 in question, once known as VH-OJU “Lord Howe Island,” had served Qantas for two decades, carrying 2.5 million passengers across more than 70 million kilometres. Upon retirement from commercial service, it was flown to AeroTEC’s flight test centre in Moses Lake, Washington, to begin a two-year conversion into a next-generation flying testbed. “This is a significant investment that will expand our world-leading test capabilities,” said Gareth Hedicker, Director of Development and Experimental Engineering at Rolls-Royce at the time. However, as engine development timelines contracted and testing demands evolved, the project was deemed surplus to requirements.

Looking ahead: A new era in testing

In the wake of N787RR’s retirement, Rolls-Royce is pivoting towards ground-based testing and new aviation frontiers. With ongoing development of its UltraFan demonstrator, ALECSys lean-burn engine, and research into hydrogen-compatible propulsion systems, the future of engine testing may increasingly rely on digital modelling and advanced ground rigs like Testbed 80 in Derby.

The end of an icon, the rise of new possibilities

Nonetheless, the gap left by N787RR will not be easily filled. It provided unmatched flexibility, accommodating everything from widebody Trent engines to business jet powerplants on a single adaptable platform. The aircraft didn’t just generate terabytes of performance data; it embodied the philosophy of innovation through rigorous in-flight testing. It made headlines, inspired engineers, and proved time and again that theory only takes flight when tested in the sky.

The 787RR bridged generations of engine technology, offering critical insights from Trent to Pearl and laying the groundwork for what comes next. It showed the aviation world that with the right vision and platform, even a decades-old airframe could remain at the cutting edge of aerospace advancement.

Au revoir, magnificent multi-tasker of the skies!

With its retirement, Rolls-Royce bids farewell to a “magnificent multi-tasker of the skies”, an aircraft that redefined what flying laboratories could achieve. Its legacy now fuels the next wave of cleaner, more efficient engines poised to power the aircraft of tomorrow.

The sun may have set on N787RR’s final mission, but its contrails of innovation continue to stretch far into aviation’s future.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image1.jpeg,N,,2025-07-28 13:56:21.382890

White House Releases Fact Sheet on the U.S.- Japan Trade Deal

On July 23, 2025 the White House published a Fact Sheet on a proposed trade and investment agreement with Japan.

As part of the agreement, imports from Japan will be subject to a baseline 15% tariff rate. On the other hand, Japan has committed to increase market access for U.S. goods on a host of products. For instance, Japan has agreed to increase imports of U.S. rice by 75%, with an expansion of import quotas and agreed to purchase $US 8 billion in U.S. goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel. Japan has committed to purchase U.S.-made commercial aircraft, including an agreement to buy 100 Boeing aircraft. The Fact Sheet states that Japan has agreed to lift “longstanding restrictions on U.S. cars and trucks” and recognize U.S. automotive standards.

Further, the Fact Sheet states that Japan will invest $US 550 billion directed by the United States to rebuild and expand core American industries in sectors such as energy, semiconductors, critical minerals, pharmaceuticals and commercial and defense shipbuilding. The United States is expected to retain 90% of the profits from all investments.

The White House and Indonesia reach a Framework Deal on Reciprocal Trade

On July 22, 2025 the Trump administration and the Indonesian government agreed to a Framework for Negotiating an Agreement on Reciprocal Trade. In exchange for an IEEPA Reciprocal tariff rate of 19% set to begin on August 1, 2025, Indonesia has agreed to purchase commitments and offered a host of tariff and non-tariff related concessions to the United States.

Indonesia has agreed to procure (i) Boeing aircraft currently valued at $US 3.2 billion, (ii) purchase agriculture products, including soybeans, soybeans meal, wheat, and cotton with an estimated total value of $US 4.5 billion and (iii) energy products, including liquefied petroleum gas, crude oil, and gasoline, with an estimated value of $US 15 billion.

According to the Joint Statement, “Indonesia will eliminate approximately 99% of tariff barriers for a full range of U.S. industrial and U.S. food and agricultural products exported to Indonesia.” It is unclear whether this means that Indonesian tariffs on a majority of U.S. origin goods will be eliminated altogether or significantly reduced. The countries have agreed to negotiate rules of origin to ensure that the benefits of the agreement are limited to the parties.

Indonesia has also agreed to address nontariff barriers on industrial and agricultural exports. These include accepting vehicles built to U.S. federal motor vehicle safety and emissions standards; accepting FDA certificates and prior marketing authorizations for medical devices and pharmaceuticals; exempting U.S. exports of cosmetics, medical devices, and other manufactured goods from certification and labeling requirements among others; exempting U.S. food and agricultural products from all import licensing regimes (including commodity balance requirements) and recognizing U.S. regulatory oversight (including listing of all U.S. meat, poultry, and dairy facilities) and accepting certificates issued by U.S. regulatory authorities. Further, Indonesia has committed to remove restriction on exports of critical minerals to the United States.

The country has also committed and address a number of other issues such as barriers to digital trade, protection and enforcement of labor rights, maintaining and enforcement of environmental laws and address global excess capacity in the steel sector by joining the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity.

As indicated above, the current agreement is a “Framework” and the United States and Indonesia are expected to continue negotiate and finalize a formal agreement in the coming weeks.

Washington, DC, July 28, 2025 – The National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) welcomed the inclusion of multiple industry-supported policies in the Fiscal Year 2026 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies (THUD) bill passed by the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee.

The Senate THUD bill includes $22.4 billion in funding for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), $13.8 billion of which is allocated for agency operations, $4 billion for facilities and equipment and $290 million for research and development. As with the THUD bill passed by the U.S. House Appropriations Committee on July 18, the Senate measure also recommends funding for the hiring of 2,500 new air traffic controllers.

These initiatives are consistent with the aims of the Modern Skies Coalition, a group of more than 50 international industry stakeholders, including NBAA, supporting a comprehensive upgrade of the nation’s ATC system that serves approximately 45,000 flights and 2.9 million passengers every day.

“We are grateful that the Senate Appropriations Committee recognized the need for swift action to approve this comprehensive funding measure that will enhance safety and reliability of ATC, in addition to many other positive steps to ensure the U.S. maintains its global leadership in aviation,” said NBAA President and CEO Ed Bolen. “We urge Congress to finalize passage of this important legislation.”

Bolen also thanked Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Susan Collins (R-ME) and Ranking Member Patty Murray (D-WA), as well as Senate THUD Committee Chair Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS) and Ranking Member Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) for their work on the measure.

In line with the House funding bill, the Senate measure also eschews calls to privatize the nation’s ATC network. “The committee does not support any efforts to transfer the FAA’s air traffic functions to a not-for-profit, independent, private corporation,” the bill reads, adding such a system would have led to funding shortfalls, ATC layoffs and significant safety risks during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The committee further cited the U.S. general aviation industry’s support for 1.3 million jobs and its $339 billion contribution to annual economic output and encouraged the DOT and FAA to support workforce development and expanded trade policies. “Collectively, aviation is the second-largest manufacturing export sector and the largest positive trade balance of any manufacturing sector,” the committee added.

Other NBAA-supported priorities in the Senate bill include recommendations for increased funding for FAA airport improvement grants and the hiring of 91 new agency safety inspectors and engineers; expansion of alternative fuels research and production of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF; and the safe implementation of expanded unmanned aircraft system (UAS) and commercial advanced air mobility (AAM) operations.

The committee also expressed support for the development of next-generation radar altimeters resistant to interference from high-strength 5G wireless communications, while also calling on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to work with the FAA on an interagency working group to identify potential spectrum impacts on aviation safety systems.

Lawmakers also called upon the FAA to look toward expanding implementation of safety management systems (SMS) to Part 145 repair facilities, parts manufacturing approval holders and supplemental type certificate holders, among other aviation operations.

Any surplus funds should be used to install radar systems in Class D airport control towers that frequently experience severe weather conditions or are located near adverse terrain, the committee added. Many of these airports are frequently used by business aviation operators.

The company, which generated revenues of $117.5 billion in the last twelve months, has maintained strong liquidity with a current ratio of 1.62. As the company continues to leverage its operational excellence and strategic positioning, investors and analysts are closely watching its performance and future prospects.

Company Overview and Recent Performance

Valero Energy, with a market capitalization of approximately $44 billion as of July 2025, has established itself as a dominant player in the refining sector. The company’s Gulf Coast-centric operations and disciplined capital allocation have been key factors in its success.

In the second quarter of 2025, Valero exceeded expectations with a strong earnings report, addressing investor concerns and showcasing its ability to capitalize on favorable market conditions. This performance has reinforced the company’s reputation for operational excellence and efficient capital management. According to InvestingPro, ten analysts have recently revised their earnings estimates upward for the upcoming period, suggesting growing confidence in the company’s prospects. InvestingPro’s analysis indicates that VLO is currently trading below its Fair Value, presenting a potential opportunity for investors.

Refining Market Dynamics

The refining sector has experienced significant volatility in recent years, with supply and demand fluctuations impacting margins. Analysts project a robust outlook for refining economics in the latter half of 2025, driven by sustained supply/demand tightness. This environment is expected to benefit Valero, given its strategic asset positioning and operational efficiency.

Crack spreads, a key indicator of refining profitability, have shown improvement, particularly after a challenging period in late 2024. Seasonal factors and industry-wide maintenance activities have contributed to a more favorable pricing environment for refiners like Valero.

Renewable Fuels and Sustainability Initiatives

Valero has been expanding its presence in the renewable fuels market, particularly through its renewable diesel segment. This diversification strategy aligns with broader industry trends towards sustainability and lower-carbon fuel options. However, analysts note that the renewable diesel segment faces near-term pressure due to low Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) and Renewable Identification Number (RIN) pricing.

The company’s growing exposure to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) presents an additional avenue for growth, although this market is still in its early stages. Valero’s investments in these areas demonstrate its commitment to adapting to changing energy landscapes and regulatory environments. With a moderate debt-to-equity ratio of 0.46 and an Altman Z-Score of 4.19, InvestingPro data shows the company maintains financial flexibility to pursue these growth initiatives while maintaining a strong balance sheet.

Capital Allocation and Shareholder Returns

Valero’s disciplined approach to capital allocation has been a cornerstone of its strategy. The company targets a payout ratio of 40-50% of cash flow from operations, balancing shareholder returns with investments in growth and sustainability initiatives. Notably, VLO has maintained dividend payments for 37 consecutive years, currently offering a dividend yield of 3.18%. The company’s free cash flow yield stands at 8%, supporting its ability to maintain these shareholder returns.

For 2025, capital spending is projected at $2 billion, with $1.6 billion allocated for sustaining operations and $400 million for growth projects. This balanced approach aims to maintain Valero’s competitive edge while positioning the company for future opportunities.

Competitive Positioning

Valero’s operational excellence and cost leadership have allowed it to capture above-average margins across market cycles. The company’s advantaged feedstocks, export market access, and relatively lower regulatory burdens compared to peers contribute to its strong competitive position.

Analysts view Valero as one of the best-positioned refiners in the industry, citing its ability to navigate macroeconomic challenges and capitalize on market opportunities. The company’s focus on operational efficiency and strategic investments is expected to support its performance in the face of long-term industry headwinds.

Bear Case

How might declining petroleum product demand impact VLO’s long-term prospects?

The refining industry faces long-term challenges from the gradual shift towards alternative energy sources and improved vehicle efficiency. As global efforts to reduce carbon emissions intensify, demand for traditional petroleum products may decline, potentially impacting Valero’s core business.

Analysts note that consensus estimates for 2026 may be overly optimistic, with potential downside risks due to these structural changes in energy consumption. Valero will need to continue adapting its business model and expanding its renewable fuel offerings to mitigate the impact of declining traditional fuel demand.

What risks does VLO face from potential regulatory changes in the refining sector?

The refining industry is subject to stringent environmental regulations, which can significantly impact operational costs and profitability. Future regulatory changes, particularly those aimed at reducing emissions or promoting alternative fuels, could pose challenges for Valero.

While the company benefits from its Gulf Coast operations, which face fewer regulatory hurdles compared to other regions, any tightening of federal or state-level environmental policies could necessitate additional investments in compliance measures. This regulatory risk remains a key consideration for Valero’s long-term strategy and financial planning.

Bull Case

How does VLO’s operational excellence position it to capture above-average margins?

Valero’s track record of operational efficiency and cost leadership has been a key driver of its success. The company’s ability to optimize its refining processes and capture advantaged feedstocks allows it to maintain profitability even in challenging market conditions.

Analysts highlight Valero’s consistent execution and disciplined approach to operations as factors that enable the company to outperform peers in terms of margin capture. This operational excellence provides a buffer against market volatility and positions Valero to capitalize on favorable market conditions when they arise.

Upgrades to the facility not only allow for improved production capabilities but also create a new avenue for soybean oil through co-processing technology.

The processing upgrades were celebrated at a ribbon cutting ceremony in July, where the CountryMark team and top Indiana ag leaders gathered to highlight the wins this will have for Indiana farmers.

Background on renewable fuel

“Renewable fuel” seems to be a catch-all phrase — at least, that is what I’ve noticed during my travels and conversations. But the truth is that these updated processing pathways create new market opportunities for farmers while supporting sustainability goals. In the case of this CountryMark expansion, new technology will allow for production of renewable diesel fuel.

Soybean oil is combined with conventional diesel to make co-processed renewable diesel fuel. Differing from biodiesel, this fuel offers more desirable characteristics, according to CountryMark President and CEO Matt Smorch.

“It is important to understand that renewable diesel differs from biodiesel in several ways,” Smorch says. “Renewable diesel meets ASTM D975 diesel specifications, is stable in long-term storage and has a low cloud point, while biodiesel does not have those characteristics.”

This expansion could mark a turning point in the renewable fuels industry, which may prove benefits to Indiana farmers. Using renewable feedstocks, the renewable diesel fuel produced at this facility alone will drive demand for up to 20 million gallons of soybean oil each year.

“This is a multi-win for farmers,” says Don Lamb, director of the Indiana State Department of Agriculture. “The farmers will benefit from the sale of the product from the farmer-owned cooperative, and they will have another purchaser in CountryMark.”

Next steps

While this expansion is a huge stride in the renewables space, there is still work to be done. It will take more refinery expansions and upgrades to match the growing output from Indiana and U.S. farmers, but this new market opportunity is a step in the right direction.

Looking ahead, another area that will need to stay top of mind is sustainable aviation fuel. And it will be important to keep these opportunities close to home.

“One area we could grow in would be within sustainable aviation fuel and encouraging the development of that technology,” Lamb adds. “We need to look for the companies who are already in Indiana and making these types of products and encourage them to create new products to increase demand for farmers and ROI for their business.”

Not only is this expansion a good move for farmers, but it also will offer a new avenue to match the need for sustainable solutions. Rather than putting that burden on the next generation, CountryMark is taking the initiative now to bring these solutions to Indiana, where both local farmers and consumers can reap the benefits.

This move comes after the company made history in 2023 by becoming the first in South Korea to export Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to Europe, reports Maeil Business Newspaper.

According to the oil refining industry on July 27, SK Energy shipped approximately 6,000 tons of HVO from its Ulsan refinery to Europe in early June. The shipment is expected to arrive in mid-August. This marks the company’s first HVO export this year and second overall, after exporting around 5,000 tons in December 2023.

HVO is a cleaner alternative to conventional diesel, produced by processing vegetable-based materials such as used cooking oil with hydrogen. It serves as a direct replacement for diesel in vehicles like trucks, buses, and passenger cars, and can be used without modifying existing engines. Compared to earlier forms of biodiesel, HVO can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90%.

Demand for HVO in Europe is growing rapidly, driven by the European Union’s stricter rules on fuel composition and carbon emissions. Under the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED), member countries must ensure that at least 29% of fuel used in transport is renewable by 2030.

Reflecting this increased demand, HVO prices in Europe recently hit a seven-month high. On June 20, prices rose to $2,216 per ton, according to industry data. An industry official said, “Europe is placing more value on eco-friendly fuels like HVO due to tighter carbon regulations. By 2026, Europe’s HVO consumption is expected to reach its highest levels yet.”

SK Energy is positioning both HVO and SAF as central to its strategy for entering the low-carbon transportation fuel market. These fuels are seen as essential to reducing reliance on fossil fuels, especially as the EU steps up its clean energy goals.

Earlier this year, SK Energy completed its first export of SAF to Europe after beginning mass production at its Ulsan refinery in 2024.

Qualifying international approved projects would have to implement solid traceability standards capturing material flows and the role of waste workers.

An EPR-funded global scheme would work in tandem with other plastics-related treaty mechanisms and private initiatives.

The international community is negotiating a new UN Plastics Treaty to end plastic pollution, with the sixth Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee session scheduled for August. A central piece of the treaty is Article 11, financial provisions that are meant to arrange how developed countries will provide financial resources, capacity-building and technology transfer to developing countries.

The stakes are high: Without adequate financing, many low-income countries simply cannot develop the waste infrastructure needed to stem plastic leakage. Yet, reaching consensus on a funding mechanism has proven difficult, and there is a real risk that finalizing the details could be pushed off to future Conferences of the Parties after the treaty is signed. Such delays would be costly.

Every year of inaction means millions more tons of plastic flowing into communities and ecosystems. The treaty’s success, therefore, hinges on finding creative ways to bridge the funding gap now, even as the formal mechanisms are still being negotiated.

Leveraging extended producer responsibility

One immediately available solution is to tap into the resources generated by Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes in high-income countries. EPR programmes make producers (e.g. brands and manufacturers) financially responsible for the post-consumer waste their products generate, often through fees or tradeable credits that fund recycling and waste management. Dozens of countries have EPR systems, from long-standing systems in Germany and Japan to newer laws in South Africa and the Philippines, usually focused on packaging and single-use plastics.

The United Kingdom’s Packaging Recovery Note and Export Note (PRN, PERN) system offers a compelling example of the scale of funding available. In the UK, producers must purchase PRNs (tradeable certificates) for every ton of plastic packaging they put on the market to meet recycling targets. In 2024 alone, the value of plastic PRNs bought by brands was around £338 million, according to the National Packaging Waste Database.

EPR fees are essentially private-sector money already being spent on compliance with recycling obligations. We propose channelling 10% of the value of these EPR credits into a dedicated fund for certified plastic waste management projects in emerging countries. In the UK’s case, such an allocation would equate to roughly £33-34 million per year directed to emerging economies’ waste infrastructure.

Importantly, this mechanism could be replicated across multiple high-income nations. France, Belgium, the Netherlands and others are piloting similar packaging EPR certificate systems. Were each group to allocate 10% of their EPR revenues to the Global South, the resulting multiplier effect would be evident.

Crucially, this idea does not require waiting for new tax legislation or the creation of a formal UN fund (which could take years). Governments can act in partnership with industry to earmark a share of existing EPR fees or credits for overseas projects. By doing so, developed nations and global brands can demonstrate their commitment to treaty goals now, jump-starting progress, instead of stalling until a complex multilateral fund is operational. It’s a proactive step that complements the treaty process.

Integrity and impact in emerging countries

Any mechanism directing funds to emerging countries must ensure the money is used effectively and transparently. Fortunately, we can draw on proven models from international climate finance. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol showed how high-income countries could invest in emissions-reducing projects in emerging nations and count the resulting credits toward their own targets.

Similarly, under a plastics-focused scheme, countries contributing a slice of EPR funds abroad could potentially count those gains (e.g. tons of waste collected and managed and/or recycled) toward their national action plans under the new treaty.

A common question is: How do we ensure that producers actually contribute and that the money reaches the communities and workers who need it most? First, governments can enforce a mandatory allocation into approved international projects, just as they currently require PERNs (Plastic Export Recycling Notes) or equivalent certificates. This makes the contribution non-optional, while still leveraging familiar systems.

To become an approved international project, traceability should be a mandatory requirement, introduced through a phased approach that supports projects in adopting it over time. Scalable technologies already exist to generate a robust digital trail from the point of plastic collection, capturing not only material flows but also the role of waste workers.

Traceability must include both material and social data to ensure accountability at every level. While a global data standard combining both does not yet exist, it is not a barrier to action. Adapting national EPR policy – focusing on pollution control in emerging economies – would rather catalyze the generation of a global data standard.

A number of organizations are already advancing this space, and the World Economic Forum’s circular innovation initiative is actively convening these efforts. Additionally, independent third-party certification, such as Verra’s Plastic Waste Reduction Standard and Zero Plastic Oceans Social Plus standard, can further ensure that only credible, results-based projects qualify for funding.

Finally, transparency can be enhanced through public registries and regular reporting by fund administrators. Projects would be required to publish annual impact reports, including how much waste was managed, how many workers were employed, and how funds were distributed.

Joining forces against plastic pollution

It’s worth emphasizing that an EPR-funded global mechanism would not exist in isolation. It complements other financial solutions under discussion and in practice. For example, the treaty negotiations can consider a “plastic polymer levy” – essentially a small fee on the production of new (virgin) plastic resin. This fee would be collected upstream from polymer producers, while EPR fees are collected downstream from product manufacturers and retailers, making the two tools naturally synergistic.

Additionally, our proposed mechanism would amplify and scale voluntary private-sector investments already underway. In recent years, alliances of companies and investors have begun dedicating funds to fill critical gaps, from corporate pledges to eliminate plastic leakage, to impact investors backing recycling start-ups.

However, these voluntary efforts, while important, remain far below what’s needed. By contrast, leveraging a fraction of mandatory EPR payments provides a sustained, significant funding stream, driven by regulation but implemented in partnership with industry. It can co-exist with other innovative financing approaches, such as the World Bank’s outcome bond, or venture funds for circular economy infrastructure. Such efforts would build a financing ecosystem where public, private and blended capital reinforce each other and decrease the risk together.

The upcoming UN negotiations offer a pivotal chance to move this idea from proposal to reality. While delegates hash out the details of Article 11’s official funding mechanism – a process that could stretch on even after the treaty’s text is agreed – they should also embrace parallel solutions that can start delivering impact immediately.

What is the World Economic Forum doing about plastic pollution?

The world produces over 430 million tonnes of plastic each year, with 19 million tonnes leaking into the environment annually. Plastic pollution fuels climate change, biodiversity loss and ocean degradation, threatening ecosystems, public health and livelihoods.

With plastic waste projected to rise dramatically by 2040, the stakes couldn’t be higher.

Since its launch in 2018, the World Economic Forum’s Global Plastic Action Partnership (GPAP) has brought together governments, businesses, and civil society to combat plastic pollution and advance a circular economy for plastics. By informing multilateral efforts at the global level and building national partnerships, GPAP translates commitments into action for a sustainable, inclusive future free from plastic pollution.

GPAP has forged partnerships with 25 countries across Latin America, Africa and Southeast Asia, making it the world’s largest initiative tackling plastic pollution.

To date, GPAP has:

Driven change for over 1.5 billion people worldwide.

Mobilized $3.17 billion to combat plastic pollution.

Improved livelihoods for 12,000 informal waste workers.

Published 10 evidence-based action roadmaps on financing, biodiversity and gender equality and social inclusion.

Amid rising expectations from regulators, customers, and investors alike, the sector is under growing pressure to develop credible environmental, social, and governance (ESG) frameworks—not as an afterthought, but as core infrastructure for trade competitiveness.

This urgency was brought into sharp focus during the Air Cargo Forum India (ACFI) Annual Conclave 2025 in a pivotal session titled “Green Corridors and Sustainable Trade Lanes – Airfreight’s ESG Imperative.” The panel, comprising airport operators, freight integrators, ground handlers, and global policy voices, explored the complex path towards a decarbonised cargo supply chain—and the institutional gaps that remain.

Gateways to market access

Sustainability, once a reputational bonus, is now becoming a gatekeeping condition for trade access—particularly with Europe and North America. The European Union’s Emissions Trading System (ETS), which from 2024 covers all intra-European flights, and ICAO’s CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), entering its first mandatory phase in 2027, will increase compliance pressure on cargo operators from non-OECD countries, including India.

“The decarbonisation of airfreight is not just about climate—it’s about staying eligible for trade,” said Glyn Hughes, Director General of The International Air Cargo Association (TIACA). “If India’s airfreight industry cannot report, reduce, and verify emissions in line with international standards, its access to premium trade lanes will diminish.”

Hughes urged the Indian government and private sector stakeholders to accelerate alignment with global reporting protocols and carbon offsetting schemes. Inaction, he warned, would amount to regulatory non-alignment—effectively creating trade barriers.

From infrastructure to climate enablers

Kadhir Kadhiravan, Deputy CEO of GMR Hyderabad Airport, highlighted the evolving role of airports as environmental intermediaries. “We are no longer just physical infrastructure—we are climate infrastructure,” he said.

Hyderabad Airport, widely recognised for its early green investments, has reduced emissions at its cargo terminal by 17 percent since 2022. This was achieved through the electrification of ground support equipment (GSE), increased solar capacity, and energy-efficient cooling systems. Yet Kadhiravan cautioned against premature celebration. “We have built the pilot projects, but scaling this across India’s cargo airports requires standardisation, policy support, and investment in SAF [sustainable aviation fuel] infrastructure.”

Notably, India’s SAF availability remains negligible. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), India produced under 50,000 tonnes of alternative aviation fuels in 2023, compared to the EU’s 1.5 million tonnes.

The sector’s emissions blind spot

While aircraft emissions attract the most regulatory scrutiny, emissions from ground operations remain largely unregulated—despite accounting for up to 30 percent of airport-related emissions, according to industry estimates.

“Handling operations are often the ‘invisible carbon’ in air logistics,” noted Anupama Kachhap, Head of Commercials at Worldwide Flight Services (WFS). “But if we are serious about ESG, they can no longer remain a blind spot.”

WFS data suggests that electrified ground handling equipment can reduce on-site emissions by 40 percent. Yet India’s adoption remains below 15 percent, mainly due to fragmented ownership models and limited access to capital.

Synhelion, a Swiss-based clean tech startup, describes the process of making solar jet fuel as a combination of affordable feedstock, cheap renewable energy, and cost-effective thermal storage.

Synhelion has benefited from support from Swiss (Swiss International Airlines) since 2020. That is when Swiss became a strategic partner. Two years later, it turned into an investor. Five years after their collaboration began, Swiss and Synhelion were able to demonstrate the use of solar fuel in civil aviation for the first time. It was a premiere for the entire aviation industry.

Although both players are based in Switzerland, the solar fuel was delivered and used in Germany. That's because it was used as part of the fuel needed for a Hamburg-Zurich flight. First, Synhelion delivered a barrel of its synthetic crude oil to a refinery in Northern Germany. Here, the oil was processed and turned into certified Jet-A-1 aviation fuel.

The crude oil used for this industry trailblazing delivery was manufactured at Synhelion's DAWN facility, using proprietary thermal energy storage system.

For the next phase, this processed fuel was integrated into the fuel supply system at Hamburg Airport, from which it was then used for Swiss flight operations. It wasn't something big, like an entire flight powered by solar fuel, but it was a first step and a symbolic start.

This first use of solar fuel wasn't about quantity, but about getting the ball rolling. Synhelion only delivered a 190-liter (50 gallons) barrel of crude oil, and the resulting jet fuel represented only around seven percent of the total fuel needed for a Hamburg-Zurich flight. The goal was to confirm that this alternative fuel can be successfully used to power airplanes via a seamless logistical process.

Could solar fuel become as popular as SAF currently is? Perhaps, but there's still a long way to go. The production infrastructure required for commercial levels is still in its infancy, and availability is poor. Synhelion has full support from the Swiss, which enables it to move down the certification and scaling-up ladder faster.

Synhelion is now looking to secure the sustainability certification for both its fuel and production process, according to the EU Renewable Energy Directive.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/solar-jet-fuel-used-for-the-first-time-in-civil-aviation-255043_1.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 09:56:09.746066

This includes producers, airlines, airports, and investors from across the globe.

In this Q&A, we speak to Michael Nau, Director of Sales and Sustainability at Lufthansa, who is leading the cost reduction programme for Lufthansa worldwide for sales.

Is it fair to say that aviation’s right to grow is predicated on its ability to grow sustainably?

It's a good question. It depends on the geographical region. In Europe, I would agree with that, because of the mandated programme by the EU, also by the UK, and because some European countries are supporting it with incentives.

In Europe, sustainability is important. Crucially, customers want it, otherwise flight shaming is a risk. And corporate travellers especially want it. B2B travellers need greener tickets with less CO2 emissions because their companies have CO2 reduction targets.

For other parts of the globe, I have my doubts. I mean when you see what's going on in the US right now, it's one step back. Drill, baby, drill. The airlines will grow because kerosene will be cheaper. We’ll see lower ticket prices and increased demand. But is it sustainable growth? No.

In Asia Pacific, sustainability is picking up. Chinese, South Korean, and Japanese companies are buying SAF from us. So Asia Pacific is slightly lagging Europe, but they're on track.

Across the MENA region, I’m seeing a big change. I can see the commitment now from local players. They’re taking it seriously. They’ve realised they have to do something for their reputation to show it matters – and that this is the future.

So, it varies. And it makes sense that Europe would be leading the way. But if European Airlines are having to pay more and ticket prices go up, then passengers will just choose to travel with other airlines who aren't subject to those mandates.

What is the boardroom appetite to embrace SAF?

For the past two years, we’ve had an executive board member responsible for sustainability. And it shows. Sustainability is now in our DNA. All our higher management have it linked to their bonus. And all our key account managers – 720 worldwide – must discuss sustainability in every single customer meeting.

We have five strategic priories. One of those is sustainability. And one pillar of that is increasing the SAF share. In five years, by 2030, we want to be down by 50 percent on CO2 emissions compared to 2019. Every year we must lower it. And that is linked to our bonus – for me as well. Sustainability has well and truly arrived. It’s not only talk.

And to achieve this reduction, [among other focus areas] 23 percent is with new airplanes, nine percent with ops/efficiency; and 19 percent with SAF. So SAF is a major pillar. It has a big focus.

Does Lufthansa have a focus on a specific SAF technology or pathway?

We’re focusing mainly on HEFA, SAF made from used cooking oil. Why? Because of the price – around 2.5x higher than fossil kerosene. We know that HEFA is not the best or the cleanest SAF, but it’s the only that is currently payable for our customers.

From 2030 on, we will look to switch to power-to-liquid (PtL) and sun-to-liquid (StL), but at the moment these are around 50 times more expensive than fossil kerosene. We’ve discussed [adopting it sooner] with some strategic global customers, and it’s interesting because it's a one hundred percent clean hydrogen, but it's too expensive. So, we have spoken to the PtL and StL companies and told them by 2030 we need this price range. If they can do it, we’ll be in the game.

What have been the other major strategic decisions to make with regards to SAF?

We had to decide whether we wanted to be a PtL/StL producer, and whether we invest in such companies. In the end, we said ‘no’ to producing.

Why? Two reasons. First, we are not experts here. Others do it better. They have the facilities. Second, their financial power is much bigger. We would need a billion-euro level investment; that’s too risky for an airline. We can’t afford to have that level of investment if it turns out to be a mistake. Our expertise is flying from A to B, and it’s better to be focused on that.

What are the major barriers to scaling SAF?

Cost is the number one. In central Europe, the willingness to pay more for a flight with SAF is there if the ticket, compared to a normal ticket without SAF, isn’t higher than ten percent – to a maximum of 15 percent, which is already a challenge.

The second challenge is sourcing SAF. Demand and supply are not in balance. One year ago we were short of SAF. We struggled to get SAF at a reasonable price on the spot market. And this is a bit of a showstopper, because there is no hedging. So you cannot plan the price.

What services or offerings are you seeing drive uptake in SAF?

We’ve developed a capability where a corporate customer can decide precisely how much SAF they want. If they want to see an 18 percent reduction in their CO2 emissions from their corporate flights in 2025, and a 21 percent reduction in 2026, we can do this in the system. Our offering is flexible to their own CO2 reduction path. It’s tailor made to each company. This product will launch in September this year. It’s really cool.

What message would you have to other airline leaders looking at SAF?

Of course, other airlines are competitors, but not on this topic. I’m happy if competitors go in the same direction. It helps the industry. We all benefit. And if they have a high demand for SAF, then producers will produce more. We don’t compete on sustainability. Our competitor Is climate change, and the time we have.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/64941dbb608c8d7e0842c57f/65b3bcc050e1d25d78e56a64/68872d525995170f17494a29/1753716836057/5.png?format=1500w,N,,2025-07-28 11:56:53.907695

In a moment marking the end of an era in aerospace testing, Rolls-Royce has officially retired its legendary Boeing 747-200 engine testbed, N787RR..

Stationed at Tucson International Airport, the aircraft concluded nearly two decades of ground-breaking flight trials, leaving behind a legacy that has shaped the evolution of modern jet propulsion.

From testing cutting-edge business jet engines to flying on 100% sustainable aviation fuel, N787RR became a workhorse of engineering advancement and a symbol of ingenuity in aviation research.

Spotter Magazine reported that the Rolls-Royce Boeing 747-200 retired on 9 June, operating one final flight before being sent to Pinal Airpark, just down the road from its home in Tucson.

N787RR: A brief history of the Rolls-Royce Boeing 747-200

Originally delivered to Cathay Pacific in 1980 as VR-HIA, the aircraft went on to serve with Air Atlanta Icelandic before its transformation by Rolls-Royce began in June 2005.

Re-registered as N787RR, the Boeing 747-200 was meticulously refitted into a state-of-the-art flying laboratory.

Stripped of passenger seating, the aircraft was equipped with high-tech instrumentation, recording systems, and a distinctive five-engine mounting configuration, allowing it to safely carry and test experimental engines in real-time flight conditions.

Its robust four-engine design made it the ideal platform, enabling engineers to evaluate new powerplants without compromising safety.

“Our FTB is a great asset to us; it is part of a wide range of test capabilities that help us ensure our engines do everything we say they will,” says Deborah Robinson, Director Test and Experimental Engineering at Rolls-Royce.

“Computers and rig tests can achieve a lot; however, in the air, we can take it a step further and perform a wide range of tests to further confirm the results of our extensive ground and rig test programmes. We can take the opportunity to test the corners of the flight envelope and feed back into our extensive models.”

Despite these impressive achievements, age eventually caught up with the aircraft. Approaching 45 years of service, N787RR faced mounting maintenance and operational costs. With an average of 25 test flights per year, each sortie required increasing logistical support to maintain airworthiness.

Plans for a new Rolls-Royce Boeing 747 were scrapped

Rolls-Royce had once planned to replace the 747-200 with a newer 747-400 variant, registered as N747RR and acquired from Qantas in 2019. But that project was ultimately shelved in 2022 due to the global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Rolls-Royce invested £56 million ($94 million) in the acquisition and refurbishment of the aircraft. This is in addition to a £90 million investment in Testbed 80 in Derby, described by the company as “the largest and most intelligent testbed in the world.”

The 747-400 in question, once known as VH-OJU “Lord Howe Island,” had served Qantas for two decades, carrying 2.5 million passengers across more than 70 million kilometres. Upon retirement from commercial service, it was flown to AeroTEC’s flight test centre in Moses Lake, Washington, to begin a two-year conversion into a next-generation flying testbed.

“This is a significant investment that will expand our world-leading test capabilities,” Gareth Hedicker, Director of Development and Experimental Engineering at Rolls-Royce, said at the time.

However, as Rolls-Royce struggled to navigate the COVID downturn, the new testbed was deemed surplus to requirements.

Rolls-Royce moves to ground-based testing

In the wake of N787RR’s retirement, Rolls-Royce is pivoting towards ground-based testing and new aviation frontiers.

With the ongoing development of its UltraFan demonstrator, ALECSys lean-burn engine, and research into hydrogen-compatible propulsion systems, the future of engine testing may increasingly rely on digital modelling and advanced ground rigs like Testbed 80 in Derby.

Nonetheless, the gap left by N787RR will not be easily filled. It provided unmatched flexibility, accommodating everything from widebody Trent engines to business jet powerplants on a single adaptable platform.

The 747-200 bridged generations of engine technology, offering critical insights from Trent to Pearl and laying the groundwork for what comes next. It showed the aviation world that with the right vision and platform, even a decades-old airframe could remain at the cutting edge of aerospace advancement.

With its retirement, Rolls-Royce bids farewell to a “magnificent multi-tasker of the skies”, an aircraft that redefined what flying laboratories could achieve. Its legacy now fuels the next wave of cleaner, more efficient engines poised to power the aircraft of tomorrow.

UK names SAF and e-SAF projects to share £63mn funding

London, 22 July (Argus) — The UK government has named 17 sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and e-fuels projects to share £63mn ($85mn) grant funding in the third round of its advanced fuels fund (AFF). The projects range in size from trials to commercial scale, and propose to use technologies incuding alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) or synthesis of CO2 and renewable hydrogen to make e-SAF ( see table ). The UK gave the largest sum, £10mn, to US firm LanzaJet for its 80,000 t/yr SAF plant targeting 2028 start, which will exclusively supply to British Airways. London granted £8mn to Riyadh-headquartered Alfanar for its Lighthouse Green Fuels project that aims to make more than 125,000 t/yr of SAF. Alfanar won £11mn and £8.7mn in the first and second rounds, respectively. Its start date has slipped to 2029 and costs have risen to £2bn from £1.5bn, the firm said last month. Some projects could make SAF and e-SAF, such as Essar's project at Stanlow, which aims to use a combined 550,000 t/yr of e-methanol and biomethanol to make 200,000 t/yr of SAF products. It will use the funds for a pre-front-end engineering design (Feed) study and it plans a final investment decision in 2027, it said. Nine grant winners will make at least some proportion of e-SAF, either directly from hydrogen or by converting e-methanol. This route is sometimes called power-to-liquid in the UK. Of the e-SAF projects, the largest award went to UK start-up Carbon Neutral Fuels, which won £6mn for a project that aims to make 25,000 t/yr of e-SAF starting from 2031. The firm is starting Feed for the plant, it said. The UK has now granted nearly £200mn to projects through the AFF scheme, with the third round building on the £80mn first round and £53mn second round . The third-round grants can go towards engineering, procurement and construction, Feed studies, and pre-feed studies, but not to feasibility studies. The UK is separately developing a revenue certainty subsidy scheme for novel SAF and e-SAF production. At least one UK-focused SAF project could stall having missed out on funding. The Gramm Consortium is considering ""last-minute options"" to keep a proposed 250,000 t/yr SAF plant in the UK and may re-locate to the US, the project's lead Alexander Peschkoff said. With an increasing number of world governments setting SAF quotas, pressure is mounting to add more production pathways to avoid shortages. The UK and EU have gone furthest in this respect by adding separate e-SAF quotas to spur novel production routes. But there is much uncertainty about the best technologies to use. The UK is fast approaching the 2028 start for its e-SAF quota, while the EU's is due to start in 2030.

Vivergo outlines hopes for UK bioethanol plant rescue

London, 21 July (Argus) — UK bioethanol producer Vivergo is proceeding with plans to close its 416mn litres/yr Saltend plant in eastern England, but has outlined ways the government could prevent this. Vivergo has said deliveries of wheat will cease at the end of July, and redundancies will begin in August, ahead of closure in September . It already said it had stopped buying wheat in June . The decision to close was made by Vivergo's parent company, food and ingredients group Associated British Foods (ABF), after a US-UK trade deal agreed in May that allowed duty-free imports of up to 1.4bn l/yr of US ethanol. ABF confirmed at the end of June that it was in talks with the government, but no timeline has been put on the process. The first stage of the talks was for UK producers, like Vivergo and Ensus, operator of the 400mn l/yr Wilton bioethanol refinery in northeast England, to submit their strategic business cases. Ensus has said it could close Wilton. Covering costs Vivergo told Argus it wants the government to cover losses of £3mn/month, or £35mn/yr, which it said have been incurred as a result of government decisions. Previously, ABF proposed a support package of £75mn/yr , for up to two years, for the entire UK sector. In the longer-term, Vivergo said there is appetite from private investors to finance future projects. It pointed to a recent initial agreement to supply ethanol for a prospective alcohol-to-jet sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant planned by hydrogen developer Meld Energy at Saltend. Meld told Argus that while the project will be ""underpinned by government support mechanisms"", the ""longer term plan is to eventually eliminate reliance on subsidy through reducing cost of production which will likely be through scale, efficiency and technology advancement"". Meld chief executive Chris Smith also told Argus that sourcing bioethanol directly from Vivergo helped ""risk management"". He said locally-produced bioethanol brings ""greater certainty of supply"" and ""reduces local infrastructure requirements."" Vivergo said failure to support the bioethanol sector would be ""shortsighted"", because in order to meet projected increases in UK SAF demand by 2035 the country would need ""seven more Vivergos"", or a more than 3.5 times increase in domestic bioethanol production. Regulation frustration Vivergo said another key way for the government to help is to tackle the eligibility of unrefined liquid dextrose ultrafiltration retentate (Uldur) for double counting under the UK's renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO). Uldur, which is classfied in the UK as a waste ethanol feedstock, makes up a significant share of the total import pool from the US. Biofuels made from certain raw materials classed as ""wastes"" and ""residues"" under the RTFO receive double the amount of renewable transport fuel certificates (RTFCs) for every litre of fuel produced. RTFCs are tradeable credits primarily generated by the sale of biofuel-blended fuels and are used to help obligated parties meet the RTFO mandate. Vivergo says Uldur-derived ethanol is a co-product of the wet milling process rather than waste, and its eligibility for double counting is inconsistent with the RTFO's decarbonisation aims. It said producers using Uldur are able to make double-counting bioethanol using a more carbon-intensive production process than the fermentation of wheat, yet crop-based ethanol produced by Vivergo is ineligible for double counting. Vivergo said producers of double counting product get an additional certificate worth around £260/t, meaning it is unable compete with the low prices of Uldur-based bioethanol importers from the US. And these will now be able to enter the UK duty free under the new US-UK trade deal. The UK government is consulting on whether to continue classing Uldur as eligible for double counting. Other changes proposed by Vivergo include increasing the ethanol mandate in road fuel, from E10 to E15 or E20. Vivergo previously said an E15 mandate could boost demand in the UK by 660mn l/yr. It also highlighted the potential for increased bioethanol use in marine and aviation sectors. Capturing the moment Another key point in the talks with the government is the capture of CO2, a by-product of bioethanol production, Vivergo said. The company said it is 6-9 months away from having carbon capture facilities ready, at which point it would be capable of meeting around a third of the UK's 600,000 t/yr CO2 demand. Ensus captures 250,000 t/yr of CO2 at its 400mn l/yr bioethanol refinery in Wilton, northeast England. Vivergo said losing this would mean increased CO2 imports, and noted its output of high-protein animal feed as a co-product of wheat-to-ethanol production, which agricultural firms would otherwise have to import at a higher environmental cost. The National Farmers Union has previously said that losing the UK bioethanol industry would be a ""huge blow"", as it currently has the ""capacity to purchase around 2mn t of wheat each year"", so without it ""farmers would lose a reliable market for their feed wheat.""

ICJ opinion could open door for more climate litigation

ICJ opinion could open door for more climate litigation

London, 28 July (Argus) — A landmark outcome from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on 23 July found that countries have an obligation to contribute to cutting emissions, and wealthy, industrialised nations should take the lead on tackling climate change. The court left the door open for further climate litigation, finding that breaching these obligations constitutes a ""wrongful act"" for which ""injured states"" could claim restitution and compensation. The ICJ's advisory opinions are not legally binding but carry significant weight and may contribute to the development of international law, non-profit the Centre for International Environmental Law says. International climate treaties — such as the 2015 Paris Agreement — ""establish stringent obligations upon states to ensure the protection of the climate system and other parts of the environment from anthropogenic GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions"", the ICJ said. Countries ""must fulfil their duty to prevent significant harm to the environment by acting with due diligence"", the ICJ said. It noted the discretion built into UN climate body the UNFCCC for nations to determine the means by which they cut emissions. But it was clear that ""this discretion cannot serve as an excuse for states to refrain from co-operating with the required level of due diligence or to present their effort as an entirely voluntary contribution which cannot be subjected to scrutiny"". The court found that countries party to the Paris Agreement have an obligation to present national climate plans that align with its primary temperature goal of limiting the global rise to 1.5°C from a pre-industrial baseline. The ICJ also focused on the primary cause of GHG emissions — burning fossil fuels. ""Failure of a state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system from GHG emissions — including through fossil fuel production, fossil fuel consumption, the granting of fossil fuel exploration licences or the provision of fossil fuel subsidies — may constitute an internationally wrongful act... attributable to that state"", it found. ""Where several states are responsible for the same internationally wrongful act, the responsibility of each state may be invoked,"" it said. Definitive legal guidance The ICJ's opinion ""will equip judges with definitive guidance that will likely shape climate cases for decades to come"", environmental organisation ClientEarth lawyer Lea Main-Klingst previously told Argus . Existing pathways could allow countries to take legal action against other nations, ""and no changes to international law are needed for it to happen"", CIEL climate and energy programme director Nikki Reisch tells Argus . Individual states could vary in how they interpret the court's findings, but the opinion was comprehensive and punctured arguments often used to push back on more stringent climate action. The ICJ noted that ""it is scientifically possible to determine each state's total contribution to global emissions, taking into account both historical and current emissions"", and that states could be found responsible if they do not regulate emissions caused by ""private actors"" under their jurisdictions. Climate litigation has risen steadily in recent years and cases including those challenging fossil fuel projects are ""more often reaching the highest courts around the world"", researchers at the London School of Economics' Grantham Research Institute say. And the damage caused by climate change is growing, increasing the pressure to define legal parameters and responsibilities. The ICJ proceedings hit several milestones. The issue drew the highest level of participation in a proceeding seen by the ICJ or its predecessor. And the court adopted the advisory opinion unanimously — just the fifth time in its 80-year history that this has happened. But it made the point that international law is just one tool in the fight against climate change. The proceedings ""concern an existential problem of planetary proportions"", the ICJ said. ""International law… has an important but ultimately limited role in resolving this problem"".

As the global energy transition accelerates, Plug Power is positioning itself as a key player in the hydrogen value chain with a combination of strategic partnerships, operational progress, and strong insider confidence. This article will analyze how insider sentiment and operational momentum are creating compelling investment opportunities in the green hydrogen space.

Insider Confidence as a Leading Indicator

Plug Power's CFO, Paul Middleton, has demonstrated extraordinary confidence in the company's future by purchasing a total of 1 million shares in Q2 2025. His most recent purchase of 650,000 shares at an average price of $1.0339 represents a 34.07% increase in his position. This level of insider buying is not merely a financial transaction - it's a strong signal of conviction in the company's long-term strategy and value creation potential.

Middleton's purchases are particularly significant given the current market environment. Plug Power's stock price has surged nearly 25% in Q2 2025, but the company still trades at a substantial discount to its intrinsic value. The insider's actions suggest that key stakeholders believe the market is underestimating the company's potential in the green hydrogen revolution.

Operational Momentum in the Green Hydrogen Value Chain

Plug Power is executing a bold strategy to vertically integrate its green hydrogen operations. The company's Woodbine, Georgia plant set a new benchmark in April 2025 by producing 300 metric tons of liquid hydrogen - a significant achievement that demonstrates the scalability of its production capabilities. With total internal production capacity now at 40 tons per day across three active plants in Louisiana, Georgia, and Tennessee, Plug Power is making progress toward its goal of reducing reliance on third-party hydrogen suppliers.

The company's strategic partnerships are further reinforcing this momentum. The landmark $5.5 billion project with Allied Green Ammonia in Uzbekistan, involving 2 gigawatts of PEM electrolyzers, represents a major expansion of Plug Power's global footprint. This follows an earlier partnership with Allied Green Ammonia for 3 gigawatts of electrolyzers in Australia. These projects position Plug Power as a key supplier of clean hydrogen for the production of sustainable aviation fuel, green urea, and green diesel.

Policy Tailwinds and Financial Strength

Plug Power is benefiting from a favorable policy environment. The passage of U.S. President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" (OBBB) Act has extended critical tax incentives through 2032, including the 30% fuel cell tax credit and green hydrogen tax credit. These incentives remove restrictive conditions that previously limited the company's flexibility.

Financially, Plug Power has secured a $1.66 billion conditional loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy, which underwrites its production network and mitigates investment risk. The company has also implemented ""Project Quantum Leap,"" a $200 million annualized cost-cutting initiative that has reduced cash burn by nearly 50% year-over-year. With $300 million in unrestricted cash on hand, Plug Power has the financial flexibility to continue its growth trajectory.

Strategic Partnerships Validating the Business Model

One of the most significant developments in Q2 2025 was the expanded partnership with Uline, a major North American logistics company. This multi-year agreement through 2030 includes a guaranteed offtake of up to 15 tons per day of liquid green hydrogen and the deployment of Plug Power's complete fuel cell ecosystem at up to 10 additional Uline distribution centers. This partnership not only provides long-term revenue visibility but also validates Plug Power's vertical integration strategy.

Investment Considerations

While Plug Power still faces challenges, including the need to achieve break-even gross margins by the end of 2025, the company's recent progress suggests it is on a path to profitability. The combination of insider confidence, operational execution, and strategic partnerships creates a compelling investment case.

Analysts remain divided, with 23 analysts covering the stock, including five ""Strong Buy"" ratings, 13 ""Hold"" ratings, and five ""Strong Sell"" ratings. The average 12-month price target of $1.32 implies approximately 26% downside from the current price of $1.79, but this appears to be a conservative estimate given the company's recent momentum.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-28 09:56:20.369113

The £5m purchase of the Hythe occurred during the first quarter of this financial year, according to a report to the Wirral Council’s policy and resources committee.

Peel L&P, now known as Peel Waters, and Wirral Council had entered into an agreement in September 2020 to help derisk the delivery of the 33,500 sq ft office block – viewed as a key part of the Wirral Waters regeneration plan. Peel had told the council it was worried the project would be unviable without this risk assurance – even with a £3m grant from Liverpool City Region Combined Authority.

Under the terms of the deal, the council was obligated to spend £5m to purchase a 250-year lease on the property should the value of the scheme be below £5m three years after it was constructed. Conversely, if the value of Hythe ever exceeded £5m during that time frame, the council could force Peel to sell it the office block for that same price.

Wirral Council had flagged that the lease option may be triggered by Peel in a report to its economy and regeneration committee last year. At the time, it noted that the past two evaluations of the building – which completed in 2021 – had come in at £3.9m in 2022 and £3.45m in 2023. The report noted that the value of the property, which has two of its three floors fully let, had diminished more than expected because of rising interest rates, economic pressures, and the war in Ukraine.

According to that 2024 council report, the £5m purchase was to be funded through borrowing at 5% over 50 years of £250,000 a year.

Regarding the deal, a Wirral Council spokesperson said: “Wirral Waters is one of the largest and most significant regeneration schemes not just in this region but nationally and its success is a vital element of the wider efforts to deliver new homes and promote growth and prosperity for our borough, and the development of the Hythe offices is integral to that.

“The council will do all it can to support progress across the Wirral Waters site and this agreement with Peel is another illustration of the commitment to attracting new inward investment and jobs to Wirral.”

Richard Mawdsley, director of development for Wirral Waters, pointed out the positives of the building – noting that is more than 70% let.

“Following the option agreement, Wirral Council have gained control of the BREEAM Excellent Grade A office building that cost over £7m to build and is income producing,” he said. “Rental and property values will undoubtedly grow over time as markets improve and the regeneration of the area continues. This will be accelerated if surrounding connectivity infrastructure comes forward in a timely fashion.”",https://www.placenorthwest.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Hythe-internal-Wirral-Waters-p.Lindsay-Colback-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 11:56:58.014992

Hitchai Energy will utilise its footprint, investments and partnerships to reserve capacity and lead industry efforts to address the global shortage in transformers, a critical component of power grid infrastructure.

The project follows the recent German government elections, in which energy prices and reliability were a key concern among voters. More than 70 percent of Germans cited rising living costs as their main concern, with energy prices at the forefront of this worry. Electricity demand in Germany is forecast to grow rapidly from 96 TWh in 2024 to 236 TWh by 2035, driven by AI, data centres and the electrification of key industries including vehicles, heat pumps and hydrogen.

Transformers are crucial to enable the efficient transmission and distribution of electricity. There is currently a major global shortage and Hitachi Energy is executing the largest investment plan in the global industry with $9 billion to scale up manufacturing capacity across the world. Germany is integral to the programme, having recently announced the expansion of its transformer factory in Bad Honnef. The company holds deep roots in Germany, employing over 2,000 people across eight locations, including three key manufacturing sites in Bad Honnef, Brilon and Roigheim.

The Bundesnetzagentur, and other German utilities and grid operators, urgently need transformers to prevent a delay in grid connections, blocks to new routing, and threats to ambitious expansion plans designed to support clean power and electrification. As part of the framework agreement with E.ON Hitachi Energy will deliver a considerable part of the transformers by reserving manufacturing capacity to support the accelerated expansion and modernisation of the German power grid.

“The growing importance of power grids demands bold investments and breakthrough innovations to shape the energy systems of the future” said Andreas Schierenbeck, CEO of Hitachi Energy. “Our expansion goes beyond business - it reflects our responsibility as a global leader to accelerate capacity and deliver the critical equipment our customers urgently need. Strategic partnerships like this one empower TSOs, utilities, and industry to build a more sustainable, secure, resilient, and affordable energy system for Germany.”

Hitachi Energy is the world leader in transformers, with over two million distribution transformers and tens of thousands of other transformers deployed worldwide. In high-voltage technology, one in every four high-voltage switchgear units in operation is from Hitachi Energy.

As the inventor and market leader in high-voltage direct current (HVDC) technology, Hitachi Energy has integrated more than 150 GW of capacity - enough to power two-thirds of Europe’s households. The company is also the top supplier for offshore wind grid systems, connecting over 54 GW to the grid through our centers of excellence in Germany and Sweden. Its grid automation solutions support 50 percent of the world’s top 250 utilities.

Eni's project involves the construction of new plants to produce hydrogenated biofuels at the Livorno refinery site, including a biogenic pre-treatment unit and a plant with the capacity to produce 500 000 metric tons per year of hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO), the company said in a news release.

Enilive, Eni’s company focused on sustainable mobility, will use its proprietary Ecofining technology to produce HVO, a biofuel made from renewable raw materials such as used cooking oil and agrifood waste, according to the release.

The Livorno biorefinery will be able to treat different types of biogenic charges, mainly waste and residues of plant origin, to produce HVO diesel, HVO naphtha and bio-LPG, Eni said, adding that it will be its third biorefinery in the region.

The conversion of the Livorno site is in line with Enilive's strategy to increase the production of biofuels in response to growing demand in Europe and Italy, in order to meet both emission reduction targets under RED III (Renewable Energy Directive) and the obligations to release pure biofuels for use as defined by Italian legislation. HVO biofuels aim to reduce transport sector emissions generated not only on roads, but also by air traffic, maritime and rail transport calculated along the entire value chain, according to the release.

Eni said there is a possibility in the future to modify the layout of the plant and have the flexibility to also produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is a key element of efforts to decarbonize aviation. This gives flexibility to the investment and brings it up to speed with the environmental priorities of the European Union, broadening its potential impact, the company stated.

EIB Vice-President Gelsomina Vigliotti said, “The EIB financing is key to delivering a project of high environmental, technological and strategic value, helping to promote the decarbonization of the transport sector. This is a concrete example of how industrial innovation can accelerate the path towards climate neutrality, while generating sustainable value for regions”.

Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi said, “The agreement with the EIB confirms Eni’s concrete and high-quality commitment in the transition towards increasingly decarbonized energy. It also underscores the validity of our approach, which is to invest and leverage all available and effective initiatives and technologies for reducing emissions. This virtuous approach is now leading us to convert a third refinery into a biorefinery in Italy, following the examples of Venice and Gela”.

This operation is part of the energy transition at the national and European level, contributing substantially to decarbonization of the transport sector and the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. It also supports the achievement of Italy’s targets for the production of pure biofuels, which under current legislation provides for a gradual increase in use from 300,000 metric tons per year in 2023 to 1 million metric tons by 2030, according to the release.

At the same time, it will significantly strengthen Latvia's export capacity and energy independence.

The project is developed in cooperation with investors from Ukraine and Riga port company SIA PARS TERMINĀLS, and it is included in the list of priority investment projects by the Latvian Investment and Development Agency (LIAA). Currently, the new plant's construction plan is under approval by the Riga city municipality's Urban Development Department. Construction will start immediately after approval.

“The new plant is a step in modernizing our existing business. Together with Ukrainian partners, we will create economic independence from foreign supplies, thereby shortening logistics chains and obtaining high value-added products that are currently only imported in the Baltics. Such a factory will directly benefit both fuel traders and the aviation sector. The plant will also ensure growth for other environmental sector companies with which we plan to cooperate to provide raw materials that meet biofuel production standards,” explains Armands Sadauskis, co-owner of SIA PARS TERMINĀLS, outlining the main benefits of the new plant.

The planned factory capacity is about 236,000 tons of base raw material per year, from which 93,000 tons of HVO and 87,000 tons of SAF are expected to be produced. It is estimated that the plant in Riga port will be able to supply 100% of the SAF needed for the Baltic market. Seventy percent of the produced SAF will be exported, increasing Latvia's exports by at least 150 million euros.

Innovative technologies will be used to produce renewable fuels, allowing the creation of ecological and competitive fuel alternatives from various natural production residues, mainly recycled vegetable oils. The planned plant is the first of its kind and unique at the Baltic level.

The renewable fuel production project is also an important step to promote Latvia's energy independence and local production development, based on locally available resources. It will contribute both directly and indirectly to the local economy, improving the competitiveness of Latvian companies, considering that biofuels will be needed not only by airlines. At the same time, cooperation with Ukrainian investors will develop economically important partnerships in today's geopolitical situation, which is especially important for both Latvia and Europe.",https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2025-07/28/TNA_cf9a3image_story.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 07:56:44.687578

While the use of insect ingredients is becoming increasingly mainstream, there is still work to be done to raise awareness and build trust.","Piotr Postepski, CCO of Protix, explains that insect ingredients are increasingly recognised as functional ingredients for animal feed capable of enhancing animal health and performance.

With a plethora of health and performance benefits, insects offer a power solution as a feed ingredient for animals and plants. Many animals naturally eat insects, because they are packed with protein and nutrients. In addition, insects occur naturally in soil, where they benefit soil health and plant growth.

Protix offers insect ingredients for a variety of feed markets, including aquaculture, pigs, poultry, calf and plant feed. Protix’s insect ingredients include several functional components such as proteins, lauric acid, and chitin. These ingredients have been proven to support gut health, strengthen the immune system, and enhance animal performance.

To learn more about Protix and its insect-based solutions, The Innovation Platform spoke to Piotr Postepski, CCO of Protix.

Can you start by briefly outlining Protix as a company, your solutions, and your goals?

Established in 2009, Protix is the leading name in functional insect ingredients. Our portfolio of seven premium products, including meal, oil, puree, larvae, frass, Flytilizer (an organic fertiliser), and eggs, delivers health and performance benefits across a wide range of applications. We serve five main markets – aquaculture feed, livestock feed (poultry, pig, calves), plant care, pet food and insect farming – with our consistently high-quality solutions, helping our partners achieve better outcomes for animals, plants, and their businesses.

Our naturally sustainable ingredients deliver proven health and performance benefits, from gut and oral health to skin health. From our inception, scientific evidence has been at the core of everything we do. Science is in our DNA, driving continual innovation and unique insights. We collaborate closely with research institutes, universities, and customers to conduct rigorous tests and trials, ensuring our solutions remain at the forefront of the market.

We’re committed to delivering superior quality, time after time, achieved through state-of-the-art processing facilities. Exceptional ingredient quality is what distinguishes Protix in the market. Our flexible feedstock approach allows us to source a wide variety of GMP+ certified feedstocks for our animals. Combined with our proprietary genetics, rigorous production controls, and comprehensive testing, this ensures every product meets the highest standards.

Why did Protix choose to focus on the black soldier fly as the feed ingredient? What are the advantages of the BSF over other novel ingredients?

At Protix, we invested a lot of time and effort into researching the best insect, and the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) emerged as our insect of choice. Insects have one big advantage over other novel proteins and alternatives such as soy: they devour waste, which is a huge problem across the world.

Other reasons to choose the black soldier fly include:

Efficient conversion: This creature excels at efficiently converting organic waste into valuable nutrients.

Highly nutritious: Black soldier flies are rich in the protein and other nutrients that are essential for animals.

Reliable yield: The black soldier fly has a very short lifecycle compared to other insects, growing from egg to adult larvae in just two weeks, which allows for a fast and stable production cycle and reliable yields.

Proven low footprint: Black soldier flies can be grown in a vertical farm and can realise a massive reduction in CO2 emissions and land and water use.

Local production: The flies can be grown close to where they are needed.

What potential do novel ingredients have to transform agriculture?

Insect ingredients have significant transformational power. They are functional ingredients, which customers can use to create feed that supports healthier and high-performing animals and plants. The agricultural markets we serve span poultry, pigs, aquafeed, and plant care. Across these sectors, our aim is to restore the natural order by bringing insects back into the food chain. This process adds nutrients that would not be available through direct consumption of the waste by livestock.

Insect ingredients also help reduce environmental impact. There is strong appetite among farmers, whether intrinsically motivated, responding to consumer demand, or meeting legislative requirements, to make products and processes more environmentally friendly. Insect ingredients have a low footprint. Research by the German Institute of Food Technologies (DIL) has shown that, compared to traditional protein sources like soy protein concentrate, Protix’s insect meal can reduce CO₂ emissions by up to 89% and significantly lower land and water use.

Finally, insect ingredients can create circular food chains with, for example, the major supermarket chains. The concept is that Protix accepts organic waste from retailers which is then fed to our flies. The insects convert this waste into valuable nutrients that are used in animal and plant feed. As fish, meat, and vegetables produced with these feeds are consumed, new organic waste is created, continuing the cycle.

What does the landscape of the insect sector look like at present and what are the key changes that need to be made?

Interest in insect ingredients is growing. We see more and more farms starting trials and reaping the benefits of insect ingredients for their animals and the planet. Increasingly, consumers are embracing insect ingredients as a tasty, nutritious option for animal feed that also shrinks the footprint. While some people are still learning about the benefits of insect ingredients, the growing scientific evidence for health claims speaks for itself.

Step by step, Protix is unlocking the full potential of insect ingredients through scientific research and further upscaling. Looking ahead, we actively welcome the opportunity to partner with forward-thinking livestock and aquaculture farmers for new on-farm trials. These trials offer farmers a chance to experience first-hand how premium insect ingredients can enhance their animals’ health and performance. Throughout each trial, the Protix scientists work closely together with the farmers, providing expert guidance and support. By collaborating in trials, new value can be unlocked for businesses, animals, and the environment.

How can government and regulatory bodies support change in the insect sector?

Government and regulatory bodies play a crucial role in accelerating progress within the insect sector. One of the most impactful ways to support growth is by permitting the use of lower-grade waste (e.g. supermarket waste streams) as feed for black soldier flies. This change would enable the sector to contribute even more effectively to sustainable waste management and circular economy goals. Another way to support the sustainable insect sector is to implement sustainability norms for feed products, in a similar manner as was done to make kerosine/air transport more sustainable (since 2025, a mandatory inclusion of 2% Sustainable Aviation Fuel in Kerosine applies pursuant to the ReFuel Aviation Regulation, increasing to 70% in 2050). The same approach could be applied for feed products – making the inclusion of sustainable protein (such as insect protein) mandatory in feed products, gradually replacing unsustainable commodities such as soy protein.

Additionally, providing access to public funds (such as the Common Agricultural Policy) and other incentives, similar to those available in other farming sectors, would drive further adoption of insect-based feed and help foster innovation and upscaling to get the right volumes in the market for livestock, aquaculture, and plant feed.

Finally, governments and regulatory bodies can also play an important role in educating the public about the benefits of insect ingredients. While the use of insect ingredients is becoming increasingly mainstream, there is still work to be done to raise awareness and build trust. Government support in promoting the industry, in line with the efforts of organisations such as the International Platform of Insects for Food and Feed (IPIFF), would be highly valuable.

By taking these steps, policymakers can help unlock the full potential of the insect sector, benefiting agriculture, the environment, and society as a whole.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/PROT01-29782-shutterstock_Ingo-Bartussek_1599451777.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 07:56:51.470462

The 45Z tax credit and Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) are central to shaping the US biomass-based diesel (BBD) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) markets, with significant changes impacting production economics and feedstock strategies.

New policies prioritize domestic production and feedstocks, creating challenges for foreign producers and intensifying competition for limited resources like soybean oil and used cooking oil.

The reduction of SAF tax credits and restrictions on imported feedstocks risk slowing SAF adoption and investment, particularly for alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) producers reliant on imported low-CI ethanol.

Trade policies, including tariffs and import restrictions, disrupt global supply chains, raising costs and complicating access to competitively priced feedstocks and biofuels.

Despite challenges, domestic-focused incentives and infrastructure investments offer opportunities for economic growth, energy security, and long-term renewable fuel development.

Executive summary

Biomass-based diesel (BBD), encompassing biodiesel (BD) and renewable diesel (RD), has become a crucial element of the US strategy to enhance domestic energy supply within the transportation sector. Alongside BBD, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) continues its emergence, planned as a key part of the decarbonization of transportation fuels. The federal policy landscape shapes the BBD and SAF markets, including key programs such as the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and the Clean Fuel Producers Credit (45Z).

New legislation and rule changes will add complexity to BBD profitability adoption, specifically regarding SAF. SAF producers currently face fragmented guidance on these intertwined policies, complicating investment decisions. However, these combined federal measures will largely determine the trajectory of the US SAF market through 2030.

Federal incentives have spurred significant growth in renewable transportation fuel production. Yet, these gains come with rising competition for limited feedstocks, such as soybean oil, used cooking oil (UCO), and tallow, specifically considering the expanding SAF industry. This competition intensifies supply chain challenges and raises concerns about feedstock sustainability, energy security, and market stability.

International trade plays a critical role in this dynamic, with the US importing substantial volumes of finished renewable fuels and feedstock to meet demand. Cross-border flows influence incentive availability, feedstock accessibility, and biofuel price volatility, all driven by the pursuit of profitability.

The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) legislation and the EPA RFS rule changes collide, complicating SAF adoption in the US. BBD and SAF producers navigate overlapping incentives and regulatory shifts impacting production economics and market access. Viewed separately, SAF and BBD producers receive only partial guidance needed for informed investment decisions. However, Fastmarkets believes the combination of these policies will collectively shape the US market for both SAF and BBD through the end of the decade.

Challenges surrounding low-carbon fuel alternatives

Biomass-based diesel (BBD) along with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), have emerged as viable, low-carbon alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. However, ongoing policy uncertainty combined with evolving feedstock constraints pose significant challenges to the long-term sustainability and scalability of these fuels. Additionally, rising domestic and global demand for biofuels intersects with volatile international trade markets, complicating supply chains and pricing stability.

Shifting federal policy

45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit:

The 45Z tax credit incentivizes BBD and SAF production and consumption within the US., However, the implementation of the 45Z credit in 2025 excluded imported BBD and SAF and domestic production from imported feedstocks, with exceptions for Canadian canola oil, Brazilian sugarcane ethanol, and tallow. These eligible feedstocks and their pathways are detailed in the 45ZCF-GREET model released in January 2025. The OBBB changes the 45Z tax credit beginning in 2026, with three key changes to investment and production.

The first key change requires feedstocks to be sourced from the US, Canada, or Mexico in order to qualify for the 45Z credit. Limiting the feedstock to be domestic-based, producers will struggle to acquire the needed amount of low-cost and low-carbon intensity (CI) feedstock to meet profitability levels. As a result, Brazilian sugarcane ethanol has been excluded from SAF, even though announced alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) capacity is expected to reach nearly one billion gallons by 2030, with many companies indicating plans to use this feedstock. Currently, no large-scale sugarcane ethanol plants operate in the US, requiring the feedstock to be imported. Unless the policy is adjusted, feedstock for the 45Z tax credit will be limited, placing specifically planned renewable diesel (RD) and SAF at risk.

The second key change is the reduction of the maximum 45Z tax credit for SAF production from $1.75 per gallon to $1.00 per gallon. While the CI score already limits the credit producers can claim, lowering the maximum cap further decreases the available incentive. This adjustment aligns the SAF tax credit with those for biodiesel (BD) and RD. As a result, hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) producers now have little financial incentive to prioritize SAF production over RD. Reduced incentives typically lead to increased caution among investors when evaluating projects, suggesting a slower pace of SAF adoption in the US.

One bright spot in the OBBB changes is the removal of the indirect land-use change (ILUC) penalty from CI calculations under the 45Z credit. Previously used to account for the environmental impact of land conversion, ILUC penalizes crop-based feedstocks like soybean oil (SBO) and canola oil. Eliminating this factor increases the credit value for fuels made from these domestic oils. This supports US farmers and allows these feedstocks to compete more directly with lower-CI feedstocks, such as used cooking oil (UCO). The updated policy makes crop-based oils financially viable, expanding the feedstock pool, reducing supply risk, and strengthening domestic supply chains, ultimately encouraging scaled production and long-term investment.

Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS):

The EPA proposed new rules in June regarding the Renewable Fuel Obligation (RVO) and RIN generation. The proposed increase in volume requirements is expected to drive up D4 RIN prices due to the interplay of supply and demand dynamics within the RIN market. As the EPA raises the RVOs for BBD, obligated parties such as refiners must acquire more D4 RINs to comply with federal mandates. This heightened demand for D4 RINs creates upward pressure on prices. Higher D4 RIN prices improve the economics for producers of D4-qualifying fuels.

However, the new rules also introduce significant changes in how RINs are generated, specifically for imported fuels and feedstocks. Under the proposed regulations, the EPA aims to tighten the criteria and reduce the number of RINs awarded for renewable fuels produced from foreign-sourced feedstocks or imported fuels. This shift is intended to prioritize and incentivize domestic production of renewable fuels, by limiting the RIN benefits available to imports.

Significant changes to the 45Z tax credit and the RFS have the highest impact on SAF. In 2025, the maximum SAF credit stands at $1.75/gallon, with imported Canadian canola and Brazilian sugarcane ethanol qualifying. By 2026, the credit drops to $1.00/gallon, with imports only from Canada and Mexico eligible. The removal of the ILUC penalty improves CI scores for domestic feedstocks, all requiring recalibration of investment decisions. Lower SAF credits and restricted eligibility for imported feedstocks place expansion plans at risk, particularly for AtJ producers reliant on high-CI ethanol. The Foreign Entity of Concern rules may further deter foreign investment, narrowing the field for joint ventures and global partnerships.

SAF: multiple policy changes challenge 2026 producers

Imported BBD and SAF movement

The expiration of the Blender’s Tax Credit (BTC) has had a significant impact on biofuel markets, particularly for imported fuels. Until 2025, the BTC provided a $1.00 per gallon tax credit for blended BD and RD, which served as a major financial incentive for both domestic producers and foreign exporters to the US market. Under the previous framework, imports were eligible to claim this credit, making the US a highly attractive destination.

However, with the transition to the 45Z, effective January 1, 2025, eligibility criteria have shifted to prioritize domestically produced fuels. Imported fuels are no longer able to claim the 45Z credit, removing a key economic advantage for foreign suppliers. According to data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), this policy change has already manifested in a sharp decline in BBD import volumes, with 2025 figures showing a significant drop compared to the previous five-year average.

This reduction underscores how tax policy changes can rapidly alter market dynamics, reshaping trade flows and affecting price competitiveness. Without the support of the BTC, many foreign producers find the US market less viable, leading to tighter domestic supply and upward pressure on prices. While domestic production will eventually scale to meet demand, an increased reliance on imported feedstocks is expected, creating additional supply chain and cost challenges.

Feedstock trade dependence and strategic risks

Under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), signed into law in 1977, the President can declare a national emergency and impose import tariffs without requiring congressional approval. The approach bypasses traditional trade statutes (like Section 301/232) and relies entirely on emergency executive authority. However, the courts rejected the sweeping tariff authority, with the US Court of International Trade ruling that IEEPA does not authorize broad tariffs. The court issued a permanent injunction, legally prohibiting enforcement of those tariffs nationwide, although an appeal suspended the order while the case proceeds.

In the meantime, beginning August 1, 2025, many countries will be subject to an increase in tariffs under the IEEPA. For example, BBD feedstocks imported from China are subject to a flat 20 percent IEEPA tariff, applied in addition to any existing duties, creating a steep surcharge intended to discourage Chinese energy-related imports. For Brazil, feedstocks face a much higher penalty, country-specific “reciprocal” tariffs announced at 50 percent, with no energy carve-out exceptions.

In the case of North American-origin feedstocks, Canada and Mexico face a layered import structure. All energy feedstocks must meet USMCA rules of origin to qualify for zero percent tariff treatment. When origin-compliant, these feedstocks continue to enter duty-free. However, if the imports do not meet origin requirements, they are subject to additional duties under IEEPA: Canadian-origin non-originating energy feedstocks incur a reduced ten percent tariff, while non-origin feedstocks from Mexico are assessed at 25 percent. Importers must closely document origin to benefit from preferential treatment; otherwise, they face the full surcharge.

Strategic outlook: policy challenges and opportunities

Challenges

BBD and SAF producers face significant uncertainty due to the absence of clear regulatory guidance. As legislation and policy proposals are developed, the critical question remains how these measures will be effectively implemented.

The 45Z and RFS restrict eligibility primarily to domestically produced fuels. This shift complicates the economic incentives for foreign producers, which in turn narrows supply sources. As a result, domestic producers face increased pressure to expand capacity quickly, straining feedstock availability and infrastructure. Global feedstock providers and foreign investors encounter new barriers, potentially stalling joint ventures and cross-border collaborations.

Trade policies further compound these challenges. Tariffs, import restrictions, and evolving international agreements disrupt established trade flows, limiting access to competitively priced feedstocks and biofuels from global markets.

Opportunities

Despite the challenges posed by recent policy shifts, several positive developments offer promising opportunities for the BBD sector.

By focusing incentives on domestically produced fuels, the US encourages significant investment in biofuel production infrastructure. The local emphasis on production is expected to stimulate economic growth, create jobs, and strengthen domestic energy security by reducing dependence on imported fuels.

In parallel, evolving trade policies offer the change to reinforce and optimize supply chains, promoting market stability and encouraging investment. By prioritizing domestic production and strategic international partnerships, the industry can support long-term investment in renewable fuels.

Conclusion: a global market with local consequences

The renewable transportation fuels transition has moved beyond its domestic focus. Trade plays a vital role in supplying the US with supply of both fuels and feedstocks to meet policy obligations. US policy approach requires a balance of domestic production with domestic and imported feedstock development, while maintaining decarbonization targets.

The evolving US policy environment demands foresight from SAF stakeholders. As RFS and OBBB reshape the incentive structure, producers must reassess feedstock strategies, investment plans, and technology pathways.

In this dynamic landscape, thought leadership and strategic clarity are more critical than ever. By understanding the nuances of policy changes and aligning operations accordingly, BBD and SAF stakeholders can not only navigate the headwinds but also harness the upsides to drive sustainable growth.",https://www.fastmarkets.com/tachyon/2024/10/Ag_Biofuels_GreenOilDrums_Getty-1442366863_Med.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 09:56:23.877633

Overall, deal activity in both venture capital and private equity declined compared to previous quarters.

However, late in the quarter, signs of recovery emerged, particularly in private equity, indicating a more optimistic outlook for the second half of the year.

Additionally, public equity markets demonstrated resilience, and deal-making in certain sectors continued to remain active.

The latest data from PitchBook’s Q2 2025 Netherlands Market Snapshot provides an in-depth view of these shifting dynamics.

Here are the key takeaways:

Maintained a steady economic growth

In Q2 2025, the Dutch economy maintained a steady growth pace, with GDP expanding by 1 per cent QoQ.

This performance was driven by exports, which saw a boost from increased manufacturing activity.

Inflation decelerated in June to 3.1 per cent, with tobacco having a negative effect on inflation due to the excise duty hike implemented in April 2024.

This increase was part of the Dutch government’s broader “National Prevention Agreement,” which aims to create a tobacco-free generation by 2040. On the contrary, flight tickets exerted downward pressure on inflation due to a year-over-year price drop.

Unemployment in the Netherlands stood at 3.8 per cent, making it one of the lowest in the EU. The euro experienced an appreciation against the US dollar, driven by a weakening dollar amid tariff negotiations.

The European Central Bank cut rates twice in Q2, while the US Federal Reserve kept its interest rates unchanged.

AEX recovers after tariff shock

Q2 was an unusual quarter for public markets, starting with global tariff announcements on “Liberation Day,” April 2.

Markets around the world fell sharply, with the AEX index dropping by as much as 13 per cent after the US announced a 20 per cent tariff on the European Union.

However, a 90-day pause in implementing the tariffs later eased market concerns, suggesting the announcement was mainly a negotiation tactic by the US.

By the end of Q2, the AEX had recovered to its Q1 levels. The impact of the potential US tariffs varied among Dutch companies.

While consumer staples like Unilever struggled to recover, tech and financial stocks such as ING, Adyen, and ASML saw their share prices increase. For more details, check out our analyst note, “The Impact of Tariffs on European PE.”

In Q2, there was only one public listing in the Netherlands: Triodos Bank, which listed on Euronext Amsterdam with a market cap of €434M.

VC investment grows but lags at exit activity

Venture capital deal value rebounded in Q2, although deal count remained slightly subdued. Expectations for improved activity in H2 remain high as market conditions stabilise.

More than half of Q2’s deal value stemmed from nontraditional investors participating in VC rounds.

For example, Toloka AI raised €64M from Jeff Bezos’s family office and Spotify’s CTO, Mikhail Parakhin. Notably, more than 50 per cent of Q2 VC deal value came from late-stage rounds.

VC exits in the Netherlands remained sparse, with just eight exits totalling under half a billion euros. Seven of those exits came from the IT sector.

On the fundraising front, VC activity stayed notably low year-to-date, with only three new funds closing. Nonetheless, venture capital AUM in the Netherlands continued to grow, expanding the dry powder available in the country.

PE deals slow but pick up late in the Quarter

Dutch private equity deal activity declined significantly in Q2, raising €6B across only 131 deals, one of the lowest quarterly counts in the last five years.

Dealmaking stalled at the start of the quarter in response to the US tariff announcement, which created considerable uncertainty.

However, according to PitchBook, the latter part of Q2 showed a clear ramp-up in activity, as documented in their Q2 2025 European PE Breakdown report.

The largest PE deal during Q2 was a €300M investment in SkyNRG by APG. Founded in 2009 by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, SkyNRG is active in the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry. This capital injection will support SkyNRG’s expansion into new SAF production facilities in the Netherlands, Sweden, and the US.

PE exit activity rebounded in Q2 from a deal count perspective, though the overall exit environment remained constrained due to macroeconomic challenges and valuation mismatches.

The largest exit year-to-date involved the sale of LBC Tank Terminals to Mitsui O.S.K. Lines for €1.6B, allowing French PE firm Ardian to exit its investment after holding its stake since 2017.

Fundraising stays low

On the fundraising front, private equity saw five new funds raise under a combined €2B in the first half of 2025.

Notably, 90 per cent of the capital raised came from buyout strategies. The standout in this category was Egeria, which raised €1.3B for its sixth fund, accounting for the bulk of capital raised in the Netherlands this year.

Despite a dip in new fundraising, the Netherlands’ PE asset under management remains healthy, with total AUM just shy of €50B. This sustained capital base provides dry powder that could help reaccelerate dealmaking as macroeconomic headwinds ease.

Amsterdam maintains dominance

The city comparison heatmap in the report highlights Amsterdam’s leading position in the Dutch private capital ecosystem.

Since 2015, Amsterdam has recorded €12.1B in venture capital (VC) deal value and €67.2B in private equity (PE) deal value, substantially surpassing other cities like Rotterdam, Utrecht, and Eindhoven.

While hubs such as Delft, Leiden, and Groningen have contributed to deal activity at lower levels, they have demonstrated significant involvement in specific sectors, especially in academia and health tech.",https://siliconcanals.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Dutch-startup-report.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 06:56:11.341372

With a vision to empower 50 crore citizens and triple the cooperative contribution to GDP, this policy presents a monumental opportunity to redefine, revitalize, and future-proof India’s cooperative movement across all sectors.

Among these, the cooperative sugar sector, which has played a pivotal role in transforming the socio-economic landscape of rural India, especially in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh, now stands both as a proud pillar and a vulnerable entity. The rise of the private sector, policy bottlenecks, financial distress, and technological stagnation have collectively put the sector under immense pressure.

As the second largest agro-based industry in India after textiles and a direct supporter of over 5 crore rural livelihoods, the sustainability of the cooperative sugar industry is not merely a sectoral concern, but a national rural development priority.

Strategic Pillars of the National Cooperative Policy 2025 & Their Relevance to the Sugar Sector

The Policy is built on six strategic pillars –

a) Strengthening the Foundation

b) Promoting Vibrancy

Scope 3: The supply chain challenge Where things get complicated is Scope 3: the emissions outside a company’s direct control.","Companies across sectors are moving sustainability into the heart of their operations—and supply chains are where much of the change is playing out.

PwC’s 2025 State of Decarbonisation report reveals how firms are not only sticking with climate commitments but using them to unlock long-term value.

Drawing on more than 4,000 corporate disclosures, the report shows rising climate ambition, with the shift to Scope 3 emissions marking a clear path to climate leadership.

From solar and wind energy expansion to rethinking supplier relationships, organisations are recognising that cutting carbon also cuts inefficiency. What’s emerging is a clearer sense that sustainability can fuel growth, not just reputation.

Smaller firms, bigger commitments

One of the clearest trends is the growing number of companies making climate-related pledges.

In 2024 alone, more than 4,000 businesses disclosed emissions targets to CDP—up nine-fold compared to five years ago. These pledges aren’t limited to the corporate giants.

The median revenue of committed companies has dropped from US$3.6bn in 2020 to US$1.3bn in 2024, a shift driven by supply chain pressure from larger organisations pushing Scope 3 responsibility down the line.

That means smaller suppliers are now on the hook for emissions reduction—and many are rising to the challenge.

According to the report, 37% of companies are raising their ambitions, compared with only 16% who have scaled them back. Climate targets, once seen as corporate window dressing, are now embedded enough to survive even CEO transitions.

In PwC’s sample, not a single set of climate targets was reversed after a leadership change.

""Sustainability is an untapped frontier of competitive advantage,"" says Pragya Jain, Partner at PwC UK. Pragya adds that reframing climate action from a threat response to a growth strategy is key to long-term success.

Scope 1 and 2 emissions, those from direct operations and purchased energy, are seeing steady progress.

In 2024, 67% of companies are on track to meet targets, up from 64% the year before. That said, the report also notes that most progress is being made through Scope 2 changes, especially the shift to renewable energy. With solar energy growth at 24.4% and wind at 13.1%, renewables have never expanded faster.

Still, this creates its own challenge. As demand for clean energy rises, supply may struggle to keep up, pushing costs higher and testing companies’ willingness to invest in deeper operational changes. That includes electrifying machinery, upgrading facilities for energy efficiency and backing alternative fuels like hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel.

""Technology alone can't solve the climate crisis, but it remains one of the most critical drivers of progress,"" says James Pincus, Corporate Finance Partner at PwC UK.

He calls for broader investment in climate technology and increased government support—especially in industries where emissions are harder to cut.

Scope 3: The supply chain challenge

Where things get complicated is Scope 3: the emissions outside a company’s direct control. That includes everything from raw materials to how products are used and disposed of. These emissions are, on average, 11 times higher than Scope 1 and 2 combined.

Yet, only 54% of companies are on track to meet their Scope 3 targets—an improvement, but still lagging.

Supply chains are both the problem and the opportunity. Reductions are currently most common in “Use of Sold Products,” especially in sectors like automotive and industrial goods. But supply chain engagement is still lacking. Only 22% of companies have mature programmes in place to manage emissions from suppliers.

That’s where deeper supplier partnerships could change the game. PwC points to the importance of smarter, more strategic engagement that looks beyond immediate Tier 1 suppliers and incorporates Scope 3 metrics into procurement decisions.

""By uncovering hidden vulnerabilities across supply chains and operations, businesses can proactively shape resilience strategies that protect value at risk, whether financial, operational or reputational,"" says Lynne Baber, Global Deputy Sustainability Leader at PwC.

Her message is clear: climate action is not just risk mitigation—it’s operational resilience.

Governance, investment and design

PwC’s report identifies four areas separating leaders from laggards. First is governance. Companies with clear responsibility frameworks and board-level involvement are more likely to hit emissions goals, particularly on Scope 1 and 2.

Second is capital. Firms plan to raise capital expenditure and operational spending on climate by 18% and 21% respectively by 2030. PwC encourages using internal carbon pricing and cost curves to guide investment decisions.

Third is stakeholder engagement. While 72% of companies involve suppliers and 67% engage customers, fewer have advanced strategies tailored to sector-specific needs. In energy and automotive, this might mean closer work with consumers. In manufacturing, it's the supply base that needs support.

Finally, product sustainability is emerging as a major area of value. Companies that build circularity, energy efficiency and low-impact materials into products can see revenue increases of between 6% and 25%.

By 2030, PwC estimates more than one-third of company revenues will be linked to climate transition.

Key growth sectors such as construction, chemicals, automotive and agri-food are expected to see more than 40% of revenue tied to decarbonisation—whether that’s electric vehicles, low-carbon cement or plant-based food products.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/0eedc1f8d7b8cec91acbe1d73708d060:92dc3b0fa6ed3a6d805046526f7cae9b/pwc.jfif.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 07:57:01.324873

Ethanol blending in gasoline is a global trend aimed at reducing reliance on fossil fuels and lowering carbon emissions.
Several countries have implemented policies to promote ethanol blending, with varying degrees of success.
This increased ethanol production could also boost the domestic sugar industry, which is a key source of feedstock for ethanol thereby boosting the agricultural sector.","Ethanol blending in India's fuel has the potential to significantly boost the country's growth by enhancing energy security, reducing reliance on imports, and promoting rural development. The increased use of ethanol, primarily derived from crops like sugarcane, has already shown positive impacts on the economy and environment.

The future of ethanol in India is intrinsically linked to the country's broader goals of energy security, environmental sustainability, and economic development. Achieving the E20 target by 2025 will require concerted efforts from all stakeholders, including the government, industry, and farmers.

To ensure the long-term viability of ethanol as a key component of India's energy mix, it is essential to address the challenges related to feedstock availability, infrastructure development, and technological innovation. Additionally, the exploration of alternative feedstocks and the adoption of advanced production technologies will be crucial in making ethanol a sustainable solution for India's growing energy needs.

As India continues on its path of rapid economic growth, the adoption of ethanol and other biofuels can play a significant role in meeting the country's energy demands while mitigating environmental impact. The future of ethanol in India is not just about reducing dependence on fossil fuels; it's about creating a cleaner, greener, and more sustainable future for generations to come.

Ethanol blending in gasoline is a global trend aimed at reducing reliance on fossil fuels and lowering carbon emissions. Several countries have implemented policies to promote ethanol blending, with varying degrees of success.

The Indian government has begun discussions to develop a post-2025 roadmap to further raise the ethanol blend in gasoline from 20%.

This increased ethanol production could also boost the domestic sugar industry, which is a key source of feedstock for ethanol thereby boosting the agricultural sector.

The minister shared notable results from the ethanol program, revealing that from 2014 to August 2024, it has led to foreign exchange savings of 1,060 billion rupees with a reduction of CO2 emissions by 54.4 million metric tons, and a crude oil substitution of 18.1 MMt.

India’s robust economic growth will account for 25% of global energy demand over the next two decades. Bioenergy will play a vital role in meeting this demand while also supporting climate goals and rural development. The country has over 750 MMt of available biomass, with about two-thirds used for domestic purposes like cattle feed and compost.

International Energy Agency forecast predicting a growth potential of 3.5-5 times for biofuels by 2050 due to net-zero targets, represents a substantial opportunity for India.

The Indian government's ambitious SAF targets, aiming for 1% blending by 2027 and 2% by 2028 have already been highlighted.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is crucial for reducing the environmental impact of air travel and achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. SAF offers significant reductions in lifecycle carbon emissions (up to 80%) compared to conventional jet fuel, and can also improve air quality by reducing harmful emissions. While SAF is more expensive and currently faces production and infrastructure limitations, its adoption is essential for a more sustainable aviation industry.

SAF is produced with a blend of conventional kerosene (fossil-based) and renewable hydrocarbons and can be produced from a variety of different renewable feedstocks. These include virgin oils, waste oils and fats, solid biomass, CO2, and water and renewable energy via green hydrogen.

The International Aviation Transport Association (IATA) estimates that we will need an annual of amount of 120 billion gallons of SAF by this year.",https://www.bizzbuzz.news/h-upload/2025/07/28/1971709-ethanol-blending-program-and-methanol-blending-program-for-transport-sector-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 08:56:43.399458

The Investor Case: Buybacks as a Value-Creation Catalyst For shareholders, Jet2's buyback program is more than a cash return—it's a strategic tool to enhance equity value.
Conclusion: A Model for Capital-Efficient Leisure Travel Jet2's dual focus on buybacks and growth investments offers a blueprint for capital-efficient value creation in the leisure travel sector.","The leisure travel sector, historically cyclical and sensitive to macroeconomic shifts, has seen a renaissance in post-pandemic demand. Against this backdrop, Jet2 plc (LSE: JET2) has emerged as a standout performer, leveraging its robust balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation to drive shareholder value. The recent announcement of a £250 million share buyback program—split into two tranches—has reignited investor interest in the UK-based leisure travel group. For capital-efficient investors, the move raises critical questions: Is Jet2's buyback strategy a prudent use of cash, or a distraction from its long-term growth ambitions?

The Buyback: A Signal of Confidence and Capital Prudence

Jet2's second tranche of its buyback program, launched on July 28, 2025, underscores its commitment to returning value to shareholders. With a maximum allocation of £125 million, the program is executed through Jefferies International Limited, operating as a “riskless principal” to ensure independence and compliance with UK market regulations. This structure minimizes governance risks and aligns with the company's broader capital management framework.

The rationale is clear: Jet2's management views its shares as attractively valued, given its strong cash-generative business model and low debt profile. As of July 2025, the company had already repurchased 7,092,805 shares for £125 million under the first tranche, averaging £16.72 per share. By canceling these shares, Jet2 reduces its equity base, thereby increasing earnings per share (EPS) and enhancing returns for remaining shareholders.

Balancing Buybacks and Growth: A Dual-Pronged Strategy

Critics may argue that large-scale buybacks divert capital from growth opportunities. However, Jet2's capital allocation strategy is a masterclass in balance. While the company is returning £250 million to shareholders, it is simultaneously investing heavily in its fleet. The order of 146 Airbus A321neo aircraft, valued at £6–7 billion at list prices, is a bet on the long-term demand for leisure travel and the need to modernize its operations.

This duality is where Jet2's strength lies. By financing growth through a mix of operating leases and internal cash flow—rather than diluting shareholders—management ensures that both short-term returns and long-term scalability are prioritized. The company's £3.6 billion cash balance (as of September 2024) provides ample liquidity to fund these initiatives without compromising its investment-grade credit profile.

Capital Efficiency in Action: Metrics That Matter

To evaluate Jet2's capital efficiency, investors must look beyond headline figures. Key metrics tell a compelling story:

- Return on Invested Capital (ROIC): Jet2's ROIC has consistently outperformed the leisure travel sector average, reflecting its disciplined reinvestment of cash flows into high-margin package holidays and flight-only services.

- Free Cash Flow Yield: At 12% as of Q2 2025, Jet2's free cash flow yield (free cash flow divided by market cap) suggests the company is generating value that could be distributed to shareholders without jeopardizing growth.

- Dividend Payout Ratio: The resumption of dividends at 14.7p per share in 2024—despite retaining a conservative 6% payout ratio—demonstrates a measured approach to shareholder returns.

Risk Mitigation and Strategic Hedging

Jet2's capital-efficient approach extends to risk management. A hedging program covering 80% of its 2025 fuel costs and 50% of 2026 expenses insulates the company from volatile oil prices. Additionally, its early adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) positions it to meet tightening environmental regulations without incurring significant retrofit costs. These proactive measures ensure that capital is deployed not just for growth, but for resilience.

The Investor Case: Buybacks as a Value-Creation Catalyst

For shareholders, Jet2's buyback program is more than a cash return—it's a strategic tool to enhance equity value. By reducing the share count, the company amplifies the impact of its earnings and free cash flow. With 14.3 million shares remaining available for repurchase, the second tranche could further boost EPS, making the stock even more attractive in a sector where margin pressures are persistent.

However, the success of this strategy hinges on execution. If the buyback is completed at prices significantly above the current £16.72 average, the cost-benefit analysis could shift. Investors should monitor quarterly disclosures for transparency on repurchase prices and volumes.

Conclusion: A Model for Capital-Efficient Leisure Travel

Jet2's dual focus on buybacks and growth investments offers a blueprint for capital-efficient value creation in the leisure travel sector. By leveraging its strong balance sheet, strategic hedging, and disciplined reinvestment, the company is positioning itself to capitalize on a rebound in demand while rewarding shareholders. For investors seeking a blend of income and capital appreciation, Jet2 presents a compelling case—provided the buyback is executed at favorable valuations and growth projects deliver on their promise.

In a market where many leisure travel firms are still recovering from pandemic-era losses, Jet2's proactive approach to capital allocation sets it apart. As the second tranche of its buyback program unfolds, the company's ability to balance shareholder returns with strategic growth will be a key determinant of its long-term success.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-28 04:56:29.022816

JFK Terminal 4 is the largest terminal at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport and is also the only privately operated terminal in the United States. The terminal houses 22 airlines, 12,000 employees and serves more than 28 million passengers and 18 million checked bags per year.

At the helm of the gateway to the Big Apple is Roel Huinink, President and CEO. Roel, who has a mechanical engineering background, felt early-on in his career that transportation, whether ports, rail or aviation, was his true interest.

Before JFKIAT, Roel spent 15 years at Royal Schiphol Group where he had many opportunities to see different sides of the business, including as Managing Director of Arlanda Schiphol Development Company, a retail management enterprise in Sweden, and as Director of Parking & Mobility Services at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the Netherlands. It is at Royal Schiphol that he homed in on his love for aviation, or “plane cocaine” as he jokingly calls it.

“When we hire staff, we tell them that either you won’t like it at all and you’ll run away, or if you’re still here after a year, you’ll probably be here forever!”

Bringing a customer-centric approach

Having pioneered the public private partnership (PPP) model in the United States, Roel believes that they are bringing a different approach at JFKIAT.

“PPP’s advantages are increased funding, faster project completion, and improved management flexibility. They have a customer-centric approach focused on streamlined decision-making processes, reducing bureaucratic hurdles, and enabling quicker responses to operational needs.. We are also backed by Schiphol, so there’s a lot of knowledge exchange and collaboration, which we benefit from.”

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is currently in the midst of a historic $19 billion transformation of JFK Airport, with the goal of transforming it into a world-class airport, including the building of two new terminals – the New Terminal One and Terminal 6.

Terminal 4 itself recently saw the completion of its expansion, adding 10 gates in the space of 14 months. Work included extending the reclaim area, renovating restrooms, upgrading the quality and feel of areas such as gate holds. In addition, JFKIAT invested heavily in technology focusing on operational excellence, including passenger flow management, turnaround management systems, and passenger facing technology, including self-service bag-drop, and a near fully-biometric passenger journey.

A T4 state of mind: A new vision

Central to Roel’s vision as JFK T4’s CEO is the new north star vision for the terminal

For those who are unfamiliar, a north star vision is a long-term guiding principle for a company that is designed to provide direction, a sense of purpose and inspiration towards a common goal. The next phase of Terminal 4’s transformation is the launch of its north star vision and experience strategy, which Roel says is crucial “because even though we are infrastructure providers, we are in a people and hospitality business.” The work consisted of aligning that vision with the stakeholders, partners and employees – all of whom are part of the T4 community, to reveal the true soul of the terminal and shape the future of our terminal experience through experience pillars (employee experience, passenger experience, airline experience, commercial experience, terminal ambiance).

JKFIAT has enlisted the help of Designit, subsidiary of WIPRO Ltd, that has been a strategic partner for JFK Terminal 4 on sustainability, digital strategy and innovation, including JFKIAT’s AI roadmap ,. This is part of an existing project which includes creating an AI-enabled data approach and supporting the business with a roadmap for carbon reduction, to meet its sustainability targets.

But why are they doing this?

“We created the north star for our teams in partnership with the T4 community to stand behind, to ensure that they feel included and aligned. Our north star says that we design customer experiences to represent the T4 state of mind through pride, community and innovation. Secondly, we empower people to come forward with good ideas and think out of the box. We want to improve our communication with the community, to really collaborate, because in aviation, if you want to get things done, you need to work together, which people say, but not a lot of people do. Thirdly, is pride. We wish for the T4 employees to take pride in working at T 4, serving our customers.”

So, why now?

“All the terminals at JFK Airport are competing with one another, and we have to make sure that our passengers and airlines actually choose us,” is Roel’s candid response.

“I believe that people make the difference. Yes, infrastructure is important, but if you don’t have the right culture, you can’t make a difference. Putting that into a vision that is tangible to people, that they can rally behind and become involved with, whether you are a direct employee, an airline, a business or commercial partner – that is what will really help to drive things forward.”

A new commercial and technology offering

Incorporating a sense of place is nothing new in airports, but New York is a special place.

The New York borough of Queens is widely recognised as the most ethnically diverse urban area on the planet, with over 47% of its residents born outside of the United States. Therefore, the passengers that travel through JFK are also very diverse, and this is what Roel wishes to reflect in their new concessions programme in the terminal.

“We want to create that sense of place, but evolve this further, translating it into several elements. For instance, if you open a Starbucks, you could open a standard Starbucks, or you could ask, how can we make this Starbucks represent Brooklyn and the people that live there?”

Those who have visited New York will know that every borough, such as Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan, the Bronx, each have a distinct vibe.

“We’ve divided the terminal into different boroughs, allowing passengers to feel those different vibes in the different areas of the terminal. We hope this innovative angle will cause passengers to say, ‘hey, this is something really new’.”

Roel acknowledges that every traveller is different and has different expectations: “Some want fast and efficient experiences, so you need high technology solutions like Hudson and Amazon Go. Yet other travellers want to sit down.” On the T4 website, it helpfully lists your food options depending on how much time you have.

“We are developing concepts that are either from New York, or represent the history of New York. We’ve also incorporated local businesses through our redevelopment programme, with more than 40% of the work allocated to minorities and women business enterprises (MWBEs). We also have the airport concessions disadvantaged business enterprise programme (ACDBE), which we’ve upped from 20% to over 30%.”

Passenger experience initiatives

Being a large international hub, T4 describes itself as ‘the terminal that never sleeps in the city that never sleeps’. This means passengers who have a lot of time to spend in an airport must be entertained. Would you expect to see life-size colouring book experience, pop-up selfie stations and automated retail concepts in an airport? These are all examples of passenger experience initiatives that have appeared at the terminal, which create those unexpected ‘wow’ moments for passengers.

These elements were all realised as part of the T4 arts and culture programme. Current installations include a holographic Bronx Zoo exhibition, a one-of-a-kind Queens-centric mural and a series of photographs captured by T4 employees who share their passion for aviation.

Sustainability progress

Roel says that being co-owned by Schiphol Group, and the topic of sustainability being hotter in Europe than the United States, has contributed to the air terminal operator’s energetic pursuit of sustainability. The operator is committed to reaching net zero carbon by 2050. Despite President Trump withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement for the second time, JFKIAT’s comprehensive sustainability programme follows, guided by the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, the Paris Climate Agreement guidelines.

In 2017, T4 became the first air terminal to earn the LEED Gold certification for existing buildings: operations and maintenance in the U.S., an achievement Roel is hugely proud of. In 2022 JFKIAT achieved T4’sLEED Platinum certification for Existing Buildings: Operations & Maintenance, making it the first and only existing airport terminal in the US to achieve that honour from the U.S. Green Building Council.

In 2024, JFKIAT invested in Green-e® certified Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), reducing their scope 2 electricity emissions to net zero and enabling a 16% reduction in the terminal facility’s carbon footprint when compared to its baseline.

RECs are one of many initiatives that JFK Airport as a whole is running. As part of the $19 billion transformation, the Port Authority is investing in electric ground service equipment and solar power projects on top of the new terminals and over a long-term parking garage at JFK. The agency currently operates the largest electric bus fleet serving any airport in the United States.

T4 has also been the recipient of the 2023 Greenest Airport Terminal Award by the Green Restaurant Association, an award which highlights how the terminal has more Certified Green Restaurants® than any other airport terminal in North America. The company also recently purchased 8,736 gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in collaboration with Delta Airlines to offset scope 3 business travel emissions and encourage other companies to use environmentally friendly jet fuel.

The above initiatives show a forward-looking approach that seeks to care for T4’s & JFK Airport employees and the wider Queens community, as well as the future of the aviation industry.

Challenges

With an uncertain time ahead for all airports, it is no wonder that Roel cites economic uncertainty as one of the challenges for the year ahead. However, he goes on to say that JKIAT is still in ‘transformation mode’. The terminal handled 27.7 million passengers in 2024, the highest number of passengers ever recorded, and they are expecting to handle even higher numbers this year – all while embarking on the north star programme and new mission statement, which means that this year will be crucial for Roel as an airport leader.

“I want to include our T4 staff more in the culture and really drive innovation – that will be the challenge with sustainability and technology implementation. The task is keeping your team focused on so many things simultaneously. The time when airports could focus on one thing is over. Airports, indeed most businesses nowadays, must focus on all the different facets of the business to be truly successful. For me as a leader, it is very important that we focus on data, facts and implementing. As a leader in aviation, you need to stand firm on these elements and really drive them in your organisation.”

With a distinguished track record in shaping strategy, driving innovation and spearheading business growth, Roel Huinink brings strong and capable stewardship to JFK T4.

Under his direction, T4 is well positioned to thrive in one of the world’s most dynamic and demanding markets. Fortunately for Roel, New York offers no shortage of inspiration and talent – a city defined by ambition, resilience, and an unrivalled work ethic and which has been the subject of many movies, novels and song lyrics – and there’s no better stage for bold leadership than the Empire State.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/Feature-interview.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 04:56:33.792894

За рубежом ""ЛУКОЙЛ"" поставляет клиентам биотопливо собственного производства первого поколения: автомобильный бензин с добавлением биоэтанола (до 10% объема) и биодизель, а также биотопливо сторонних производителей. Биотопливные смеси производятся на НПЗ и нефтебазах в Румынии, Болгарии и Нидерландах. ""Спрос на продукты остается стабильным с незначительными колебаниями год к году"", - отмечает компания.

Две структуры группы ""ЛУКОЙЛ"" в прошлом году получили сертификаты глобальной системы сертификации устойчивости продукции, которая подтверждает отсутствие ущерба окружающей среде (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification scheme, ISCC), признаваемые Международной организацией гражданской авиации (International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO1). Так, LUKOIL Aviation Bulgaria EOOD оформил сертификат ISCC EU2, подтверждающий соответствие требованиям Евросоюза к поставщикам устойчивого авиационного топлива (SAF). Нефтеперерабатывающему заводу в Болгарии выдан сертификат ISCC CORSIA3 (the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), удостоверяющий, что производство SAF путем смешения закупаемого биокомпонента с минеральным авиационным топливом соответствует установленным критериям устойчивого топлива. Первую партию SAF планируется произвести в 2025 году. Сертификация авиатоплива является обязательным условием поставки продукта на регулируемые рынки по выбросам парниковых газов от авиатранспорта, напоминает компания.

Помимо этого, НПЗ в Болгарии в 2024 году получил еще один сертификат международной системы ISCC-EU1. Он подтверждает, что процесс переработки натурального сырья, в частности POME (Palm Oil Mill Effluent) и UCO (Used Cooking Oil), через ко-процессинг в биотопливо второго поколения (биодизель) соответствует критериям устойчивого развития. Продукт частично заменит биодизель первого поколения (FAME), поставляемый на АЗС в настоящее время. Выпуск тестовой партии также планируется в 2025 году.

SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) - это биотопливо, которое может смешиваться с обычным авиационным топливом в пропорциях до 50%. Оно на 100% производится из возобновляемого сырья, отходов и остатков, например, из кулинарных масел, животных жиров и побочных продуктов переработки растительных масел. Благодаря тому, что в основе SAF не ископаемое топливо, а биогенное сырье, его использование позволяет сократить выбросы парниковых газов по всей цепочке создания стоимости. SAF не требует модификации воздушных судов или существующей инфраструктуры распределения топлива в аэропортах.

Регламент Евросоюза 2023/2405 устанавливает, что поставщики авиационного топлива должны гарантировать наличие доли биотоплива в любом реактивном топливе, предоставляемом операторам авиакомпаний в каждом аэропорту ЕС. Кроме того, доля биотоплива должна увеличиваться каждые пять лет с минимальных 2% на 1 января 2025 года до 6% к 2030 году и 70% к 2050 году.",https://www.aviaport.ru/favicon.svg,N,,2025-07-28 04:56:43.482127

The signing ceremony between Nathalie Tarnaud Laude, ATR CEO, and Lin Chi-Chung, UNI Air Chairman, also brought together senior leaders from ATR, UNI Air, EVA Air and Taiwan’s transport authorities.

The aircraft order is ATR’s largest from an airline since 2017 and underscores ATR and UNI Air’s shared vision for more accessible, efficient and sustainable air connectivity across Taiwan. This next-generation fleet will enable UNI Air to modernise and expand its domestic services, particularly to the outlying islands, including: Kinmen, Penghu and Matsu.

Lin Chi-Chung, Chairman of Uni Air, said: “UNI Air has a market share of nearly 60% on domestic routes. In addition to business and tourism travellers, UNI Air is an important means of transport for people living on the outlying islands needing to visit their families and seek medical treatment.”

UNI Air was the first airline in Taiwan to introduce ATR aircraft, and has accumulated 13 years of experience since 2012. In order to maintain a young fleet and a high dispatch rate – and to further enhance overall operational efficiency and market competitiveness – the new aircraft are scheduled to be delivered from 2027.

The new fleet of ATRs will be fully integrated by 2032, increasing UNI Air’s total fleet to 19 from 14 currently. Having five additional ATR 72-600 aircraft increases overall service capacity by more than 20%. In addition to meeting the expectations of the ‘visiting family and friends’ traffic to have convenient access and frequencies, additional flights can also be added in the event of adverse weather conditions or large-scale events in various cities in the future to meet the demand for passenger transport.

Nathalie Tarnaud-Laude, Chief Executive Officer at ATR, thanked UNI Air for its continued trust, and added: “UNI Air makes a meaningful difference for the communities it serves, providing them with the frequency, reliability and connectivity they need. We are delighted to renew our strategic partnership, supporting UNI Air with its expansion plans. UNI Air’s confidence in ATR is the strongest testament to the essential role our aircraft play in shaping efficient and sustainable regional aviation networks. This new order is a powerful affirmation of our mission: building aircraft that bring communities closer together.”

ATR 72-600 is the world’s best-selling turboprop aircraft, with more than 1,900 units sold to 200 airlines, and 1,300 airports served. The ATR 72-600 offers low maintenance costs and high operational efficiency to match the volume and frequency of domestic routes. The new aircraft is equipped with the new PW127XT engines, which improves fuel efficiency by at least 3% compared to its predecessor and reduces maintenance costs by as much as 20%, demonstrating excellent energy saving and operational efficiency. In terms of cabin design, the ATR 72-600 has been upgraded with a new air-conditioning and purification system and an ergonomic seat design, providing a more comfortable flying experience for passengers. The seating capacity has also been changed to 72 seats. The new 72-seat configuration not only maintains a spacious and comfortable travelling space, but also increases service capacity by 3% per flight.

With 16 domestic routes and more than 900 weekly flights, UNI Air is the most densely-flown domestic airline, serving as the most important bridging routes between the outlying islands and the eastern part of Taiwan. UNI Air has become a leading brand for domestic routes, providing a number of industry-first services, and has been recognised 10 times by the Civil Aviation Administration as the first-place winner of the ‘Domestic Scheduled Route Category’. In the future, UNI Air will continue to uphold the core values of ‘safety’ and ‘service’, improve the quality of flights and strive to create a more comfortable, convenient and trustworthy flying experience for passengers.

The ATR 72-600 is uniquely suited for airports with short runways, such as Matsu Nangan, where the 1,579-metre runway poses operational challenges for most conventional jets. Its ability to handle steep approaches and operate efficiently in geographically dispersed and topographically diverse regions makes it ideal for Taiwan’s regional network.",https://asianaviation.com/wp-content/uploads/2000px_A7403784-編輯.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 06:56:36.795815

Jason Gabelman has given his Hold rating due to a combination of factors that reflect both positive and challenging aspects of Neste’s current market position. The company has shown improvement in its Renewable Products segment, with a significant reduction in fixed costs and an increase in margins. These operational enhancements are expected to be more sustainable, providing a stable foundation for future performance. However, the market for renewable products remains oversupplied, which Neste itself acknowledges, creating uncertainty about future margin stability.

Despite strong quarterly results and outperforming its largest US peer, Neste’s stock has exhibited volatility, with gains often retracting shortly after earnings announcements. This pattern of volatility makes it challenging to predict future stock performance reliably. Additionally, while the company has made strides in cost reduction and operational efficiency, the oversupply in the global biofuels market and uncertain demand dynamics, particularly in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel segment, contribute to the cautious outlook. As a result, Gabelman maintains a Hold rating while adjusting the price target to reflect the improvements in cost structure.

Dalam bidang pertanian, biochar dari TKKS memiliki keunggulan yang jauh lebih efektif dibandingkan dengan TKKS segar.
Pemanfaatan Lainnya Dari TKKS yang dikonversi menjadi biochar, pemanfaatan dapat diperluas ke sektor energi dan lingkungan.
Selain potensi pendapatan dari produk biochar dan efisiensi pertanian, terdapat juga potensi bisnis dari penjualan energi, penjualan produk adsorben, hingga jual-beli kredit karbon.
Padahal di dalamnya tersimpan potensi perbaikan kesehatan tanah, penguatan efisiensi pupuk, bahan bakar energi, dan bahkan jejak karbon untuk keberlanjutan sawit dan pertanian di masa depan.","Jakarta, mediaperkebunan.id – Tandan kosong kelapa sawit (TKKS) merupakan salah satu limbah biomassa terbesar dari industri kelapa sawit Indonesia yang sangat melimpah volumenya. Untuk setiap ton TBS (Tandan Buah Segar) yang diolah di pabrik kelapa sawit (PKS), dihasilkan sekitar 22–25% TKKS, atau setara dengan 0,22–0,25 ton. Berdasarkan data FAO (2024), produksi TBS Indonesia mencapai sekitar 256 juta ton per tahun, sehingga potensi TKKS nasional diperkirakan mencapai 56–64 juta ton per tahun.

Selama ini, sebagian besar TKKS segar oleh pekebun hanya dimanfaatkan secara langsung sebagai mulsa atau penutup tanah dengan cara disebarkan di bawah tanaman belum menghasilkan (TBM) dan Tanaman menghasilkan (TM), dengan dosis sekitar 20–45 ton per hektar per tahun. Praktik ini bermanfaat, tetapi dekomposisinya lambat dan unsur haranya tidak langsung tersedia bagi tanaman, serta memerlukan logistik yang tidak efisien. Di samping itu, tersimpan bahaya tersembunyi, potensi tumpukan TKKS dapat menjadi site breeding kumbang tanduk (Oryctes rhinoceros), salah satu hama berbahaya bagi tanaman kelapa sawit.

Potensi Pemanfaatan Biochar

Kini, dengan kemajuan teknologi termal, TKKS dapat diolah menjadi biochar melalui proses pirolisis — pemanasan bahan organik pada suhu 350–600°C dalam kondisi minim oksigen. Proses ini akan menghasilkan tiga fraksi utama: padatan (biochar), cairan (bio-oil), dan gas (syngas). Dari setiap ton TKKS kering, dapat dihasilkan sekitar 200–300 kg biochar, tergantung pada kadar air dan efisiensi proses.

Teknologi ini kini tersedia dalam berbagai skala dan dapat diterapkan di sentra produksi kelapa sawit baik oleh koperasi petani, PKS, maupun pelaku industri hilir. Dengan nilai kalor sekitar 20–25 MJ/kg, biochar juga berpotensi digunakan sebagai bahan bakar padat atau briket pengganti batu bara kelas rendah.

Dalam bidang pertanian, biochar dari TKKS memiliki keunggulan yang jauh lebih efektif dibandingkan dengan TKKS segar. Struktur pori biochar mampu meningkatkan kapasitas tukar kation tanah, memperbaiki retensi air, dan mendukung aktivitas mikroba menguntungkan.

Aplikasi biochar di lahan sawit dengan dosis 5–10 ton/ha/tahun dapat memberikan manfaat agronomis setara atau bahkan lebih tinggi daripada 40 ton/ha TKKS mentah, dengan volume dan beban logistik yang jauh lebih rendah. Selain itu, biochar dapat dikombinasikan dengan kompos atau pupuk organik lain untuk meningkatkan efisiensi serapan unsur hara dan mengurangi ketergantungan pada pupuk kimia.

Pemanfaatan Lainnya

Dari TKKS yang dikonversi menjadi biochar, pemanfaatan dapat diperluas ke sektor energi dan lingkungan. Di sektor energi, biochar dapat dimanfaatkan sebagai bahan bakar biomassa padat atau pencampur bahan bakar untuk boiler (co-firing) pada industri semen, pembangkit listrik berbasis biomassa dan industri lainnya.

Di sektor lingkungan, sifat adsorptif biochar menjadikannya bahan penyaring yang efektif untuk pengolahan air limbah, remediasi logam berat, hingga penjernihan air. Dari sisi mitigasi iklim, setiap ton biochar yang dimasukkan ke tanah menyimpan sekitar 2,5–3 ton CO₂ ekuivalen, yang dapat diklaim sebagai kredit karbon dalam pasar karbon sukarela (voluntary carbon market), dengan potensi nilai ekonomi antara USD 5–30 per ton CO₂.

Jika dibandingkan dengan praktik konvensional aplikasi TKKS segar, yang nilai ekonominya terbatas pada penghematan pupuk sekitar Rp 300.000–600.000 per hektare (USD 19 – 38 per hektare), konversi TKKS menjadi biochar membuka peluang ekonomi jauh lebih besar.

Selain potensi pendapatan dari produk biochar dan efisiensi pertanian, terdapat juga potensi bisnis dari penjualan energi, penjualan produk adsorben, hingga jual-beli kredit karbon. Transformasi ini mengubah paradigma: dari sekadar limbah organik menjadi komoditas strategis yang menopang pertanian berkelanjutan, transisi energi terbarukan, dan kontribusi konkret terhadap dekarbonisasi nasional.

Selain itu, masih ada potensi lain dari pemanfaatan TKKS, yakni dikonversi menjadi Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) menggunakan teknologi Fischer-Tropsch (FT) salah satu jalur teknokogi yang diakui ASTM, yakni dengan mengubah TKKS menjadi gas sintesis dan selanjutnya bahan bakar jet (Bioavtur/SAF). Pendekatan ini akan mendukung pengurangan emisi sektor aviasi sekaligus meningkatkan nilai tambah limbah sawit.

Selama ratusan tahun, TKKS hanya dianggap sebagai limbah—ditinggalkan membusuk di bawah pohon, tak pernah benar-benar dilihat sebagai sumber kehidupan baru. Padahal di dalamnya tersimpan potensi perbaikan kesehatan tanah, penguatan efisiensi pupuk, bahan bakar energi, dan bahkan jejak karbon untuk keberlanjutan sawit dan pertanian di masa depan.

Mungkin kini saatnya kita berhenti memperlakukan limbah sebagai beban, dan mulai menjadikannya sebagai produk bernilai. Karena di balik warna biochar yang abu menghitam, ada harapan yang menyala—untuk bumi yang lebih lestari, untuk petani yang lebih sejahtera, dan untuk sawit Indonesia yang lebih bermartabat.",http://mediaperkebunan.id/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Biochar-dari-TKKS.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 02:56:55.376054

GC's plan is being considered after the company started commercial production of 6 million litres of SAF a year at its biorefinery at Map Ta Phut in Rayong earlier this year, using used cooking oil as a raw material.

SAF, which produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fuel, can be blended with jet fuel to support the aviation industry's campaign against global warming.

“The crash not only represents an immense human tragedy but also marks one of the largest single claims events in the recent Russian aviation insurance market.
Insurers will cover liability claims related to passenger fatalities, governed by Russian law and the internationally binding Montreal Convention.
As the company ceded only 56.2% of the total aviation liability GWP, this incident will push the company’s aviation business into losses.
However, the Russian aviation insurance market has been historically highly profitable, with the loss ratio remaining well below 30% in the last three years.","Following the news that, on July 24, 2025, Angara Airlines Flight 2311, an Antonov An-24RV turboprop, crashed near Tynda in Amur Oblast in eastern Russia, resulting in the tragic loss of all 48 people on board, including 42 passengers and six crew:

Chandini Sharma, Insurance Analyst at GlobalData, a data and analytics company, comments: “This catastrophic accident will cost around $20 to $25 million to the Russian aviation insurance market. Claims paid by Russian insurers for the AZAL plane crash in December 2024, and this accident will not only reduce the profitability of the Russian aviation insurance market in 2025 but also increase the reinsurance rate for Russian insurers. It signals a growing pattern of severe and frequent losses that will reshape the risk environment for both the Russian and international aviation insurance and reinsurance markets, which are already reeling under pressure from the costly Air India plane crash in June 2025.

“The crash not only represents an immense human tragedy but also marks one of the largest single claims events in the recent Russian aviation insurance market. The total loss will comprise around $10 million of aviation hull and the rest as liability claims. Insurers will cover liability claims related to passenger fatalities, governed by Russian law and the internationally binding Montreal Convention. Initial estimation of liability claims, based on applicable regulations, could go up to $9 million. However, this could further escalate based on the investigation report.

“Russian insurers will bear a major portion of the loss, as aviation insurers retain most of the risk and cede less than 60% of the gross written premiums (GWP) to reinsurers during 2020-24. In 2024, insurers ceded 32.6% of the GWP to reinsurers.

“SOGAZ JSC, the leading Russian insurer, confirmed that it holds the civil liability policy for Angara Airlines. As the company ceded only 56.2% of the total aviation liability GWP, this incident will push the company’s aviation business into losses. However, as aviation contributes only 0.6% of the company’s general insurance GWP, this will not have a significant impact on its overall performance.

“This disaster comes amid ongoing turbulence in Russia’s aviation insurance landscape, destabilised by elevated claims severity, inflation in repair costs, and disruptions linked to the Russia-Ukraine aircraft leasing dispute. However, the Russian aviation insurance market has been historically highly profitable, with the loss ratio remaining well below 30% in the last three years. The recent AZAL (based on earlier industry estimates of around $30 million) and Angara Airlines crash-related claims could go up to $50 million compared to the estimated aviation GWP of $298 million in 2025.

“With recent major aviation losses, insurance premiums and reinsurance rates are expected to increase. International reinsurers are expected to revisit their terms and conditions. Also, the ongoing investigations into the crash could result in regulatory action and trigger additional business interruption claims.”",https://asianaviation.com/wp-content/uploads/Angara_Airlines_Antonov_An-24RV_RA-47315_20220309.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 22:56:45.689044

By Dan Rivera

On July 9, 2025, Rolls-Royce officially retired its much-loved Boeing 747-200 flying testbed, registered N787RR, concluding nearly two decades of in-flight engine development and evaluation. Nestled at its base at Tucson International Airport, this aerial laboratory played a pivotal role in shaping the next generation of jet propulsion, and its legacy will endure.

Built in 1980 for Cathay Pacific, the aircraft began its life as VR-HIA before passing through Air Atlanta Icelandic and ultimately being acquired by Rolls Royce in June 2005. Re-registered as N787RR, it was refashioned into an engine testbed—stripped of passenger fittings and equipped with instrumentation, recording stations, and a custom mounting configuration to support up to five engines simultaneously. Choosing the four-engine 747-200 allowed Rolls Royce to safely mount experimental powerplants—such as the Trent 1000 or Pearl 10X—under one wing while maintaining redundancy with the remaining three certified engines. Over its operational lifespan, N787RR became synonymous with test flight innovation. In October 2023, the testbed flew a Trent 1000 engine powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), covering nearly four hours, reaching 43,000 ft, and completing a figure-eight flight path over Arizona and Texas. This demonstrated both long-duration reliability and the viability of SAF in real flight conditions. Beginning March 29, 2024, Rolls Royce used N787RR to conduct flight testing of the Pearl 10X, developed for the Dassault Falcon 10X business jet. Multiple test flights—including high-altitude trials up to 45,000 ft—validated engine performance, handling, anti-icing systems, in-flight relight capabilities, and fan vibration characteristics. By mid-2024, the engine had completed at least ten flights aboard the testbed.

Over more than 20 years in service, the airframe successfully accommodated a variety of engine types. Its unique five-engine configuration provided unparalleled flexibility for testing both commercial widebody engines and smaller business jet powerplants. Inside aviation circles, the aircraft earned affection for its mission, often spotted at Tucson International. Hobbyists noted the unique registration “N787RR” and the unusual configuration with three certified engines on one wing to counter the thrust of the test engine.

As Rolls Royce accelerates development of future engines—such as UltraFan, ALECSys, and potential hydrogen compatibility platforms—the aging 747-200 airframe has reached its operational limits. While it has flown an average of about 25 flights per year, each sortie incurs high support and maintenance costs associated with an almost 45-year-old airframe. Moreover, the company’s plan to convert a newer 747-400 (registered N747RR) into a modern flying digital testbed was shelved in 2022 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which curtailed engine development scheduling and reduced demand for an expanded flight testing fleet. With those plans canceled, Rolls Royce made the strategic decision to decommission N787RR and refocus flight testing on alternative platforms or ground-based facilities where feasible.

N787RR leaves behind a legacy of critical achievements. It pioneered real-world SAF usage, proving sustainable fuels are flight-worthy for modern turbofans. It enabled early validation of the Pearl 10X, accelerating a class-leading engine destined for the Falcon 10X. It also provided unmatched flexibility in testing multiple engine types, from Trent widebody models to business jet engines—all on one adaptable platform. Most importantly, it served as a workhorse for decades, bridging generations of Rolls Royce engine programs and elevating the company’s global test capabilities.

While N747RR—the Boeing 747-400 acquired from Qantas in late 2019—is no longer being converted and will be scrapped, Rolls Royce continues to explore its remaining testbed operations on other platforms. The company’s focus now shifts to preparing for UltraFan’s entry into flight testing once demand arises, as well as potential hydrogen fuel engine trials. In the future, data-intensive ground test rigs and flight simulators may take on larger roles. However, for the era it served, N787RR embodied the art of faithfully reproducing flight conditions in real time—and its absence will be felt in the test hall and the skies alike.

Over an operational span exceeding 18 years, metering thousands of flight hours, N787RR proved indispensable to Rolls Royce’s journey from Trent to Pearl—and toward UltraFan and beyond. Its retirement marks the end of a venerable chapter in aviation testing, but the data, engineering lessons, and innovations it delivered continue to power the future of more sustainable, efficient jet engines. As the curtains close on the Boeing 747-200 flying testbed, its contribution to modern aerospace stands as a testament to what an adaptable mid-life transformation can achieve—and what in-flight testing still offers in an ever-changing aeronautical landscape.",https://vintageaviationnews.com/wp-content/uploads/Rolls-Royce-Retires-Iconic-747-200-Engine-Testbed-N787RR_3_n-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 13:56:21.975159

A lobby group pushing for a third runway at Heathrow has been accused of distributing “incredibly misleading” leaflets to homes in west London — while receiving funding directly from the airport.

Back Heathrow recently sent out flyers suggesting that an expanded airport would be “greener,” claiming only the “cleanest and quietest” aircraft would fly from the site.

The leaflet campaign comes as Heathrow prepares to submit its long-awaited planning application by July 31 — a plan already backed by the Government, according to Sky News.

Back Heathrow describes itself as a local campaign group representing over 100,000 residents, but its newsletter does not disclose that it receives funding from Heathrow Airport. The group's website is similarly ambiguous, stating it was “initially launched with funding” from the airport and has “since grown” — without clarifying its current financial ties.

A disclaimer at the bottom of each page reads: “Back Heathrow is a group of residents, businesses and community groups who have come together to defend the jobs that rely on Heathrow and to campaign for its secure future.”

Heathrow Airport has not disclosed how much it contributes to the campaign but says it has always been transparent about funding the project.

Back Heathrow is led by former Labour MP for Gloucester Parmjit Dhanda, who also sits on the party’s National Policy Forum, which helps shape Labour policy. The group's accounts name a second director, John Braggins, a former campaign adviser to Tony Blair.

Its most recent filings show the organisation holds £243,961 in cash reserves.

In the newsletter, executive director Mr Dhanda responds to a question about sustainability.

He writes: ""We can build a cleaner, greener and smarter airport - using more sustainable aviation fuel, ensuring only the cleanest and quietest aircraft fly here, reduce stacking in our skies and modernise our airspace to cut emissions in flight.""

But campaigners have rejected Back Heathrow's environmental arguments as ""myths"".

Climate activist and aerospace engineer Finlay Asher described the emissions savings from sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as ""highly debatable"" and that usage of these fuels is ""relatively low"".

""Air traffic growth at Heathrow will wipe this out,"" he said. ""There is no policy in place which prevents older generation aircraft from being operated out of any airport.""

Regarding Back Heathrow's claims about reducing ""stacking"", where aircraft are left waiting over an airport to land, Mr Asher said: ""Adding more aircraft to the sky won't make this easier.""

Heathrow Airport announced plans earlier this month to raise its capacity by 10 million passengers a year, before a third runway is built, and to increase charges paid by passengers to finance the development.

A Heathrow spokesperson said: ""Back Heathrow represents tens of thousands of local people who want to make their views known on the importance of Heathrow to their communities and livelihoods today and into the future.

""We have always been clear that, alongside individual residents, local business groups and trade unions, we provide funding for Back Heathrow to provide a voice for local people who historically have not been heard in the debate about expanding Heathrow.""

On behalf of the campaign group, Mr Dhanda said: ""At Back Heathrow we are proud of our link to Heathrow Airport (the clue is in the name).

""We have always been open about the fact that we receive support from the airport and that they helped set the organisation up to balance the debate about expansion at a time when the voices of ordinary working people from the diverse communities around Heathrow were not being heard.""

""Back Heathrow also receives support from trade unions, local businesses and residents from amongst the 100,000 registered supporters it now has.”

In conclusion, Boeing's strategic and operational turnaround under David C. J. Ortberg presents both opportunities and risks for investors.","In the realm of global aerospace, few stories are as compelling—or as fraught with challenges—as Boeing's recent trajectory. The company, once a symbol of American industrial might, has faced a series of setbacks that have tested its resilience and redefined its strategic priorities. Under the leadership of CEO David C. J. Ortberg, who assumed the role in August 2024, Boeing is attempting to reposition itself as a company that values safety, quality, and long-term stability over short-term gains. For investors, the critical question remains: Is this recovery sustainable, and does it offer a compelling long-term investment proposition?

A Strategic Shift: From Production to Quality

Ortberg's tenure has been marked by a deliberate shift in focus from production metrics to operational excellence. This approach, while initially costly in terms of cash burn and revenue delays, reflects a recognition that Boeing's past emphasis on speed and scale contributed to its current challenges. The grounding of the 737 MAX in 2019 and the Air India 787 crash in June 2025 have reinforced the importance of restoring trust with regulators, customers, and the public.

The company has taken concrete steps to address these concerns. By mid-2025, Boeing plans to ramp up 737 MAX production to 42 units per month, supported by an agreement with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to ensure safety and quality. This gradual increase is a calculated move to avoid repeating past mistakes, as Ortberg has acknowledged that ""speed without safety is not progress.""

The decision to prioritize quality has also led to the shutdown of temporary ""shadow factories,"" a move that will free up labor for other production lines and help reduce the company's massive $87.5 billion inventory. This inventory reduction is crucial for improving cash flow, which is expected to turn positive in the second half of 2025. However, the company still anticipates a net cash outflow of $4 billion to $5 billion for the full year, underscoring the magnitude of its financial challenges.

Financial Realities and Strategic Adjustments

Boeing's financial performance in 2024 was dire, with a total loss of $11.82 billion and a cash outflow of $14.3 billion. The company managed to avoid insolvency by raising $24 billion through the sale of shares and convertible debt. These actions, while necessary, have raised concerns about the company's balance sheet and its ability to compete with financially healthier rivals like Airbus.

The integration of Spirit AeroSystems, a former subsidiary sold two decades ago, is another key strategic move. This integration, expected to be completed by mid-2025, is a complex task that could pose both financial and production challenges if not managed effectively. The success of this integration will be a critical test of Boeing's ability to execute its strategic vision.

Despite these challenges, there are signs of cautious optimism. The company's stock has shown resilience, gaining 43% from November 2024 to early 2025. This performance has been supported by a shift in investor sentiment, with some analysts upgrading the stock to ""buy"" status. However, as BofA analysts have noted, trust in Boeing remains ""extremely fragile,"" and a single misstep could trigger a significant downturn.

Sustainability and ESG Initiatives

Under Ortberg's leadership, Boeing has also placed a renewed emphasis on sustainability and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors. The company has committed to making its entire commercial airplane family 100% SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel)-capable by 2030, a move that aligns with global decarbonization goals. Boeing has also partnered with Norsk e-Fuel to develop electro-SAF, which has the potential to reduce emissions by up to 90%.

In terms of supply chain resilience, Boeing has implemented the Cascade Climate Impact Model, a tool designed to optimize decarbonization pathways and integrate environmental considerations into supply chain decisions. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to position Boeing as a leader in the next generation of sustainable aviation.

However, the company's ESG progress must be weighed against its ongoing operational and financial challenges. While Boeing's sustainability initiatives are commendable, they require significant investment and execution discipline—areas where the company has historically struggled.

The Road Ahead: Risks and Opportunities

For investors, the key consideration is whether Boeing's current trajectory can be sustained over the long term. The company faces a competitive landscape dominated by Airbus, which is viewed as more financially stable and better positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for sustainable aviation technologies. Additionally, Boeing's credit ratings remain at the edge of investment grade, adding financial pressure to its operations.

The recent Air India crash has further complicated the company's recovery, introducing new regulatory scrutiny and reputational damage. While Boeing's leadership has expressed confidence in its ability to resolve these issues, the incident highlights the fragility of the company's current position.

Despite these challenges, Boeing's long-term prospects are not without merit. The company has a $545 billion commercial aircraft backlog and remains a key player in the defense and space sectors. Its focus on safety, quality, and sustainability aligns with global regulatory trends and customer expectations. If Boeing can maintain its current strategic direction and avoid further setbacks, it may be able to regain its position as a leader in the aerospace industry.

Investment Implications

For investors, the decision to invest in Boeing must be based on a careful assessment of the company's strategic priorities, financial health, and risk profile. The company's current recovery efforts are ambitious and, if executed successfully, could lead to a sustainable turnaround. However, the path to recovery is fraught with risks, including regulatory challenges, operational setbacks, and competitive pressures.

Given the company's precarious financial position and the fragility of its current trajectory, investors should consider Boeing as a high-risk, high-reward opportunity. The company's stock is currently trading at over 20 times its 2028 forward earnings, a valuation that appears disconnected from its fundamental financial challenges. This premium reflects market optimism but also exposes investors to significant downside risk if Boeing fails to meet its stated goals.

For those willing to take on the risk, Boeing offers the potential for long-term growth, particularly if it can successfully execute its strategic initiatives and navigate its current challenges. However, a diversified investment approach that includes exposure to the broader aerospace sector may be more prudent for most investors.

In conclusion, Boeing's strategic and operational turnaround under David C. J. Ortberg presents both opportunities and risks for investors. The company's focus on safety, quality, and sustainability is a positive development, but its financial and operational challenges remain significant. Investors must carefully weigh these factors when considering Boeing as a potential investment.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-27 08:56:07.144468

In 2023, the USAF stated it was obligated to reduce emissions and targeted 2046 for net-zero emissions. Now, Trump is working to roll back Federal emissions targets across the board. At the same time, residents in Seattle are protesting the Navy’s Blue Angels for being environmentally unfriendly, so what is the DoD doing about the emissions of military aviation?

Military aircraft in an age of net-zero pledges

Ahead of the United States Navy’s Blue Angels performance at the Seafair show, The Seattle Times is reporting locals protesting with a new billboard reading “Say no to Blue Angels.” It adds the Airshow Climate Action coalition has hung up signs saying “Demilitarize Seafair.”

By 23rd July, a community organiser in Seattle, Kimberly Larson, had gathered more than 5,000 signatures calling for the end of the Blue Angels at the show.

Fox News ran a story about one disgruntled woman suing the Blue Angels for “state-sanctioned acoustic torture.”

Lauren Ann Lombardi claims the noisy F/A-18E/F Super Hornet jets terrorised her cat, Layla, in its final days. Lombardi was eventually blocked from commenting on the Blue Angel’s Instagram page.

One of her comments read “Stop with your F—— b——- you are terrorising my cat and all the other animals and wildlife.” Another message read, “Nobody gives a f— about your stupid little planes.”

The Blue Angels perform around 60-70 shows annually, attracting huge numbers of spectators, and are extremely popular across the nation.

Seafair is an annual summer festival in Seattle with various citywide celebrations. Notable events include the Torchlight Parade, the Seafair Cup hydroplane races, and an air show that normally features the Navy’s Blue Angels.

The Blue Angels include six Navy and one Marine Corps demonstration pilots. They fly Super Hornets and are supported by the C-130J Super Hercules tactical airlifter. It is the second-oldest formal aerobatic team in the world, having been formed in 1946.

The push for fuel efficiency in military aircraft

As momentum builds around the world to decarbonise transportation, from cars to ships to aircraft, how is this affecting the world’s military aviation?

In a certain sense, all air forces, along with all commercial airlines, have wanted to reduce emissions from the very beginning. For commercial airlines, it translates to lower fuel expenses, which makes a big difference to their bottom line.

In the military, more efficient aircraft (and, coincidentally, more environmentally friendly) translate to aircraft with greater ranges, greater available payloads, and smaller logistical supply chains. All very appealing attributes for defence.

The relative fuel efficiency of an aircraft is one of the paramount concerns of airlines when ordering new airliners and choosing when to retire old aircraft.

The US Air Force is going net-zero by 2046

The US Air Force’s goal is to reduce emissions by 50% from 2008 levels by 2033 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2046. Internationally, the UK’s Royal Air Force has set 2040 as its goal to achieve net-zero emissions.

In 2023, the USAF reported on its Department of the Air Force Climate Campaign Plan. It said its three overarching priorities are:

To maintain air and space dominance in the face of climate risks

To develop a climate-informed workforce whose decisions build a climate-resilient force and reduce climate risk

To optimise energy use and pursue alternative energy sources

The Air Force is building solar-powered infrastructure around its bases and is currently looking into applications for the future use of eVTOL aircraft.

Its Climate Campaign Plan form the backbone of environmental measures at USAF. The force says adapting to climate change challenges will “be critical to meet our national security obligations.”

“Our natural environment has become more dynamic due to the effects of global climate change,” the document reads. It adds that USAF bases are increasingly impacted by the effects of climate change.

“We cannot launch or recover aircraft on a flooded runway, nor can we operate from installations devastated by hurricanes and wildfires,” the USAF says.

It is unclear if the Air Force will maintain its goal to be net-zero by 2046, given the climate-sceptic Trump Administration. Trump has taken aim at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to roll back climate measures.

In July, the Columbia Law School stated, “President Trump issued an executive order aimed at dismantling many of the key actions that have been undertaken at the federal level to address climate change.”

Time will tell if this will be a permanent or long-lasting change in federal policy. Trump’s term is limited to four years, and the US Federal Government has flip-flopped on environmental protection and emission reductions with successive administrations.

What’s the US Navy doing to reduce its emissions?

In 2010, during the Obama Administration, the US Navy announced it was celebrating Earth Day by “showcasing a supersonic flight test of the ‘Green Hornet,’ an F/A-18 Super Hornet strike fighter jet powered by a 50-50 biofuel blend over the Patuxent River.”

The test attracted hundreds of onlookers, including Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, who the Navy said “has made research, development and increased use of alternative fuels a Navy priority.”

In 2016, CBS News wrote, “In 2009, Mabus committed the Navy to 50% usage of alternative fuels by the year 2020.”

It’s now 2025, and it doesn’t appear the Navy has reported on increasing its use of biofuel for more than a decade. In April 2025, the Navy announced it was rescinding the Biden Administration’s Navy Climate Action 2030 programme.

In fact, the entire US military is no longer chasing climate change targets under the current administration. According to Fox News, in April, Department of Defense (DoD) Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote,

“The Dept of Defense does not do climate change crap. We do training and warfighting.”

According to the Heartland Institute, the US military is the largest institutional user of petroleum-derived fuel in the world. It is estimated that the DoD uses 4.6 billion gallons of fuel each year, with 56% consumed by the Air Force.

Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) has integrated climate risk into its strategic planning and is exploring microgrids at northern bases exposed to cyclones. The Luftwaffe (German Air Force) participates in EU-wide military decarbonisation goals and is trialling electric tow tractors and biofuels.

In the United Kingdom, the aim is to be net-zero by 2040. Initiatives include Project MARTIN to explore hybrid aircraft and partnerships with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers in the UK.

Both the US Air Force and the Royal Air Force have conducted successful test flights using SAF. The RAF flew a Voyager powered by 100% SAF in 2022, and the USAF has used blends in tankers and transports.

The next generation of fighter jets will be even more efficient

Forthcoming 6th-generation fighter jets are expected to be significantly more fuel-efficient than their 5th-generation predecessors, but with important caveats: Efficiency improvements will stem largely from advanced propulsion systems, aerodynamic design, and systems integration, but whether this translates into lower emissions depends on how they’re used and what fuels they burn.

One of the most anticipated changes in sixth-gen fighters is the adoption of adaptive cycle engines, such as GE’s XA100 and Pratt & Whitney’s XA101, being developed under the US Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP).

The US Air Force says adaptive engines could deliver 25% better fuel efficiency, 10% more thrust, and significantly greater range.

Next-generation fighter jets, like the UK, Italian and Japanese ‘Tempest’, are being designed with an electrically intensive architecture, meaning far more of their systems—avionics, weapons, sensors, flight controls—will be powered by electricity rather than hydraulics or bleed air.

6th-gen fighters will also benefit from better aerodynamics and materials, such as blended wings, lighter composites and internal weapons bays to reduce drag.

Even with a 25% fuel efficiency improvement via the adaptive cycle engine, burning fossil fuels still contributes to the problem. Increasing the supply of SAF and certifying 6th-generation aircraft to use it will still be paramount to a meaningful decrease in emissions.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Blue-Angels-FA-18-Hornets-.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 08:56:11.030135

At the same time, cross-border trade is emerging as a key growth area for Indian SMEs. In an interview, Sandeep Juneja, Vice President – Sales and Marketing, DHL Express India, shared how the company is adapting to evolving shopper preferences, investing in automation, and supporting small businesses with digital tools and global trade partnerships. From advanced sorting facilities and RFID-enabled visibility to SME-focused programmes like GoTrade and MyGTS, DHL Express India is building the infrastructure and intelligence needed to power the next phase of logistics in a digitally connected economy.

The DHL E-Commerce Trends Report 2025 shows that 80% of Indian shoppers abandon carts due to missing preferred delivery options. How is DHL Express India responding to these rising delivery expectations in terms of speed, flexibility, and transparency?

With a network that covers over 220 countries and territories, we can connect people and improve lives with great efficiency. This can only be done with the help of our people and leveraging automation where it counts. For example, our automatic shipment sorting hub in Delhi houses the automatic sorting machines with a capacity to sort 2000 pieces per hour, delivering a 30% improvement in productivity. Our services like 'Clear-in-air' facilitate customs clearance during transit, reducing delivery times. At every touchpoint, we ensure to maintain a high service level.

Security and transparency are crucial to our operations, and we ensure that our customers continue to trust us as their first choice. The integration of RFID chips within the supply chain helps us enhance shipment visibility, accuracy, and security. With the growing reliance on technology, cybersecurity threats remain on the rise. DHL therefore runs an information security management system with data centres and a robust set of objectives, processes, and guidelines underpinning our information security policy. To enhance visibility throughout the shipping process, we offer tools like Track & Trace, which allows shippers to monitor their shipments in real time and prevent delays.

Our ‘On Demand Delivery’ service empowers shippers and recipients to customise delivery preferences, offering them flexibility and reducing the likelihood of undelivered shipments, thereby improving customer satisfaction. DHL Express India has expanded its ODD platform, allowing customers to choose from a range of flexible options, including rescheduling deliveries, changing addresses, and selecting preferred delivery time windows. This has proven particularly effective in serving the needs of the growing e-commerce segment, where convenience and control directly influence purchase decisions.

Together, these efforts reinforce DHL Express India’s commitment to meeting the evolving expectations of modern consumers, strengthening our position as a trusted logistics partner for e-commerce growth in India.

With Indian consumers increasingly prioritising sustainability, how is DHL Express innovating in areas like green logistics, carbon offsetting, or packaging — and are there any notable partnerships driving these efforts?

The most notable progress is that we are one of the few organisations worldwide and the first in logistics to take a stand in reducing our Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. We are doing what is technically feasible and commercially viable right now.

We have set milestones to focus our efforts and measure our progress, under Strategy 2030 where we have added ‘Green Logistics of Choice’ as our fourth bottom line. These transparent, time-bound targets and KPIs are integral to our strategic planning and decision-making processes, much like our financial goals. By 2030, over the base of 2021, we aim to achieve the following objectives:

Reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to <29m metric tons of carbon* by doubling down and accelerating decarbonisation measures across all operations.

Target >30% Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) blending in our Express and Global Forwarding businesses.

Electrify 66% of our last-mile delivery vehicles.

Leverage a carbon-neutral design for all new buildings.

As of 2024, we are incredibly proud to say that we have made significant headway against these targets. In 2021, GHG emissions stood at 40 million metric tons. Comparatively, in 2024, this was reduced to 33 million metric tons CO2e. In our buildings, we are expanding the use of solar power to generate electricity.

By 2024, as a Group, over half of our 66% last-mile electrification target was already achieved as 41.4% of our pickup and delivery vehicles were electrified.

We consistently advanced the decarbonization of our business activities, leveraging sustainable aviation fuel in our air transport activities. Through insetting, GoGreen Plus offers customers a measurable and certified way to reduce logistics-related emissions without relying on offsetting. The SAF used is sourced through global partnerships with suppliers like bp, Neste, Cosmo Oil Marketing and World Energy, and is produced from sustainable feedstocks such as used cooking oil and other residues. Through these strategic partnerships, we have succeeded in increasing the use of sustainable aviation fuels in our own fleet to 3.5%, despite the continued low availability of such fuels. This puts us well above the average for the logistics industry.

How are drones or autonomous vehicles being evaluated or adopted by DHL Express in the Indian mid-mile or first-mile logistics space? Could such innovations soon be viable at scale in this region?

We are always actively exploring new technology, including drones and autonomous vehicles to enhance the efficiency of our logistics operations.

DHL Express has long supported the global ambitions of Indian SMEs. With evolving trade dynamics, how are you enabling cross-border e-commerce growth for these businesses, especially in key verticals like fashion, electronics, jewellery and personal care?

DHL Express is committed to supporting the government’s active effort to make India an export-led, ‘aatmanirbhar’ (self-dependent) economy. MSME’s play a key role here as the backbone of India's economic landscape, pivotal in employment generation, entrepreneurship promotion, economic development and exports.

DHL’s GoTrade programmes specifically aims to foster international trade and promote sustainable economic growth by empowering MSMEs to engage in cross-border commerce. Leveraging our expertise in logistics, customs, and trade, the programme seeks to educate MSMEs on the strategic advantages of global trade and equip them with the necessary tools to access international markets. As a global trade facilitator with a presence in over 220 markets, our objective with GoTrade is to integrate MSMEs into the larger narrative of globalisation.

In the jewellery segment, for instance, we have signed an MoU with the Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) to enable India-crafted jewellery to be shipped globally via our time-definite international (TDI) courier services. This ensures faster, more secure deliveries with complete shipment visibility. GJEPC members benefit from exclusive pricing and educational seminars that equip them with best practices in international shipping and compliance.

We have also signed an MoU with the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) to conduct training and capacity-building workshops across 76 districts in India. These sessions focus on building capabilities in global trade processes, documentation, and e-commerce fulfilment, particularly for sectors like fashion and personal care, where branding and timely delivery are critical.

Furthermore, by partnering with the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), we have onboarded over 200 SMEs. We are providing them with post-onboarding incubation support, including help with product selection, pricing, order management, and promotions—all of which are essential for success in verticals like electronics and personal care.

Additionally, DHL Express has implemented many digital solutions that help MSMEs and startups kickstart their global sales.

A tool like My Global Trade Services (myGTS) is particularly beneficial to sellers in their business strategy development phase. As a free, online, self-service pre-shipment planner, it allows companies to identify the correct Harmonised System (HS) codes to categorise products for shipping. It also offers preliminary data on existing free trade agreements between the source and target countries. This information gives sellers a transparent understanding of the associated costs, enabling effective product pricing. When the business is prepared to make the leap, they can open a DHL account from anywhere and at any time. The setup is also accessible to startups and individual shippers lacking a credit history.

DHL Express Commerce, integrating DHL Express shipping services with numerous e-commerce platforms, aids businesses in automating shipment creation and managing the fulfilment process. This feature is particularly useful for sellers who need to ship multiple orders efficiently.

The First Time Buyer (FTB) Programme is a dedicated initiative designed to support first-time shippers, including SMEs, especially those who are new to global trade. Recognising that first-time shippers often face uncertainty and complexity, the programme provides a structured, hand-held onboarding experience to build confidence and enable success. Over a 90-day support period, we proactively monitor shipments and conduct regular check-ins, ensuring that first-time shippers feel guided every step of the way.

Through these multi-stakeholder collaborations and targeted interventions, we are not only enabling Indian SMEs to meet global standards but also ensuring they are well-equipped to seize emerging opportunities in cross-border e-commerce.

Are you seeing any shift in demand across international trade lanes due to tariff changes or trade policy uncertainty? How do these developments affect your pricing, transit strategies, or customer communication?

What we have usually noticed is that when there is trade slowdown within one trade lane, we usually see trade picking up on another trade lane. Trade is ever evolving but so are we at DHL and therefore we remain dynamic, constantly keeping an eye on our network and ensuring that we are there for our customers in an uncertain and volatile environment.

DHL Express is often associated with speed and premium service. Are there new service offerings or digital tools being introduced in India that enhance customer control, delivery customisation, or predictive tracking?

Technology helps us remain one step ahead of the curve. Leveraging innovations such as real-time tracking systems, automated sorting facilities, and advanced data analytics to name a few, DHL is streamlining processes, reducing transit times, and offering a far superior customer experience. We have numerous tools that keep our ‘big yellow machine’ moving and more importantly excelling -

Right now, a liter of conventional aviation fuel costs around £0.96 per liter in the U.K. – for sustainable aviation fuel it’s around £1.97.
They saw themselves as a crucial part of the sustainable aviation fuel puzzle, but were concerned about investing in logistics and infrastructure without guaranteed demand.
Their thinking is dominated by environmental strategy and sustainable aviation fuel regulation.
By navigating this turbulence wisely, the sustainable fuel sector can be part of a broader flight path to net zero.","As you wait in the departure lounge for your flight this summer, you may notice your airplane being pumped full of fuel ahead of takeoff. And then you may start to wonder why flying is still so dependent on fossil fuels, and whether you should have booked a holiday destination that’s accessible by a more environmentally friendly form of transport.

So what happened to plans for so-called sustainable aviation fuel? Wasn’t it supposed to be the “game changer” that would make flying a much greener travel option than it used to be?

Clearly, the move to adopt the technology is facing difficulties. One problem seems to be that there simply isn’t enough sustainable fuel to go around.

But the business side of the process is also holding back sustainable fuel uptake.

Research my colleagues and I conducted in 2021 revealed a deeply fragmented landscape at pretty much every step of sustainable fuel development. There are obstacles everywhere, blocking the paths of the producers developing these fuels, the airlines who might use them and the governmental and campaign groups pushing for change.

Everyone seems to agree that sustainable fuel matters. They just don’t all agree about how to really get it off the ground.

Our findings demonstrate that producers, for instance, were understandably focused on more research and development to improve efficient production. They were also worried that scaling up facilities could disrupt production that is already in place.

Airlines, meanwhile, are grappling with the economics of moving to sustainable fuel, which is around three to ten times more expensive than conventional fuel. Right now, a liter of conventional aviation fuel costs around £0.96 per liter in the U.K. – for sustainable aviation fuel it’s around £1.97. (Depending on the length of the journey and the size of the engine, a plane could need around 13,000 liters per hour of flying.)

They spoke about inconsistent supply (especially at major airports), and the need for clearer regulations and incentives across the industry.

“Cost is clearly the most important driver,” one airline executive told us, explaining that dealing with those costs would ultimately depend on passenger demand for greener travel – and how willing those passengers are to pay a premium for sustainable fuel.

Distribution companies that take the sustainable fuel where it needs to go, have found themselves struggling to navigate the complexities of an emerging supply chain. They spoke of the logistical challenges of transporting and storing sustainable fuel, and a lack of clear communication between producers and airlines.

They saw themselves as a crucial part of the sustainable aviation fuel puzzle, but were concerned about investing in logistics and infrastructure without guaranteed demand.

Elsewhere, politicians and climate campaigners tend to view the adoption of sustainable fuel from a broader perspective, stressing the urgency of action on climate change. Their thinking is dominated by environmental strategy and sustainable aviation fuel regulation.

But here, trust becomes an issue. Some of those involved with sustainable fuel development said they doubted government promises to support the sector over the long term. Others are cynical about whether airlines will really prioritize climate action over their very tight profit margins.

Up in the air

So sustainable fuel inspires plenty of different viewpoints and concerns. But one common thread was an overwhelming concern about cost and scale of production.

Aside from being far more expensive than fossil-based jet fuel, building enough production facilities to make more will require billions of pounds of investment.

The big question is who will foot the bill.

Some of this will need to be tax funded. For if the U.K. wants to become a leader in the use of sustainable aviation fuel, as the government says it does, it needs more than ambitious targets. It needs to start making things happen.

And our research suggests that the industry as a whole would benefit from some certainty to encourage investment right across the supply chain. Without a clear and stable regulatory framework, everyone will remain hesitant about committing significant resources to sustainable fuel.

Collaboration between the key players could also be improved, with a better dialogue between those in the industry and regulators, potentially leading to a shared vision for the future of sustainable aviation fuel.

That future is by no means doomed. Major commercial airlines like Air France-KLM, IAG (British Airways) and United Airlines in the US are working with sustainable fuel producers around the world.

But while the desire to decarbonize aviation seems clear, the path forward is not straightforward. It is a complex picture of politics, economics, trust and differing priorities.

By navigating this turbulence wisely, the sustainable fuel sector can be part of a broader flight path to net zero. But if managed poorly, targets to dramatically increase its use will remain elusive.",,N,,2025-07-27 05:56:09.652631

The group, called Back Heathrow, sent leaflets to people living near the airport, claiming expansion could be the route to a ""greener"" airport and suggesting it would mean only the ""cleanest and quietest aircraft"" fly there.

It comes as the airport prepares to submit its planning application for a third runway ahead of the 31 July deadline, following the government's statement of support for the expansion.

Its website also does not mention the current financial support and says it ""initially launched with funding from Heathrow Airport but we have since grown"".

At the bottom of every web page, the organisation says: ""Back Heathrow is a group of residents, businesses and community groups who have come together to defend the jobs that rely on Heathrow and to campaign for its secure future.""

Heathrow Airport said it had always been clear about funding Back Heathrow, but would not disclose how much it provides.

Who's behind Back Heathrow?

The group's executive director is former Labour minister Parmjit Dhanda, who was MP for Gloucester from 2001 to 2010 and sits on the National Policy Forum - the body responsible for developing Labour policy.

Latest accounts for Back Heathrow show it had five employees, including its two directors, in the financial year ending 30 June 2024. The second director is John Braggins, a former campaign adviser to Tony Blair.

The business had £243,961 in cash, the accounts show.

What are the group saying?

In the newsletter, executive director Mr Dhanda said people ask if Heathrow is sustainable. In answering the question, he appeared to suggest the airport can dictate what types of planes use Heathrow.

""We can build a cleaner, greener and smarter airport - using more sustainable aviation fuel, ensuring only the cleanest and quietest aircraft fly here, reduce stacking in our skies and modernise our airspace to cut emissions in flight,"" he wrote.

When asked by Sky News what Back Heathrow meant and what the source for the claim was, the organisation pointed to the airport's traffic light system of noise and emission measurements for the 50 largest airlines serving Heathrow.

""The scheme helps to see what areas certain airlines are excelling in and where improvements can be made,"" a spokesperson said.

But those ""cleaner and greener"" claims were dismissed as ""myths"" by one campaigner.

Finlay Asher is an aerospace engineer and co-founder of Safe Landing, a group of aviation workers and enthusiasts seeking climate improvements in the industry.

He said the emissions savings from sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) were ""highly debatable"" - but added that even if they were taken at face value, use of these fuels is ""relatively low"" and so only provides small emissions reductions.

""Air traffic growth at Heathrow will wipe this out,"" he said.

Mr Asher also disputed the claim that only the cleanest and quietest aircraft will fly at Heathrow. ""There is no policy in place which prevents older generation aircraft from being operated out of any airport,"" he said.

As for reducing ""stacking"" - where aircraft wait over an airport to land - Mr Asher said if that's the goal, ""adding more aircraft to the sky won't make this easier"".

Opposition to Back Heathrow's claims also came from Rob Barnstone, founder of the No Third Runway Coalition, which is funded by five local authorities surrounding Heathrow Airport.

He said that regardless of fuel efficiencies or new quieter engines, having the additional 260,000 flights Heathrow has said will be created with an extra runway - in addition to the airport's current cap of 480,000 - would create ""an awful lot of noise"".

""For all the best will in the world, Heathrow is a very, very, very noisy neighbour... When you're adding a quarter of a million additional flights, that's going to create an awful lot of emissions, even if they're using planes that are ever so slightly less environmentally damaging than previous planes,"" Mr Barnstone said.

Green claims

Under the heading of ""UK sustainable fuel industry for Heathrow"", Back Heathrow said ""advances in electric and hydrogen powered aircraft can ensure we meet our environmental targets"".

Elaborating on this, Back Heathrow told Sky News: ""Zero-emission electric and hydrogen aircraft are very much the end goal for civil aviation and countries like Norway have set 2040 as the year that all of their short-haul flights will be by electric planes.""

The statement was called ""incredibly misleading"" by Dr Alex Chapman, senior economist at the left-leaning think tank New Economics Foundation (NEF).

""There's just absolutely no confidence that those aircraft are going to have any meaningful impact on emissions and commercial aviation in any reasonable time frame. And, yeah, we can all speculate as to what may not happen in 50 years' time. But I think the people living around the airport should be given the information about what's actually realistic.""

Even if the technology were available, the runway may not be ready for it, Dr Chapman said.

""Perhaps more importantly, there's been no indication so far that the proposed new runway is being built to cater for those types of aircraft, because a runway that caters to electrical, hydrogen powered aircraft would be very different to one that was for conventional fuel, particularly in terms of the fuelling infrastructure around it that would be required: pipes to pipe hydrogen, massive charging power facilities.""

While work is under way to develop electric aircraft, there are currently no commercial electric flights taking place. The best-case scenario is battery-powered flights that may be suitable for short journeys.

But as a major international airport, more than 40% of Heathrow's flights are long-haul and medium-haul.

And while airlines such as easyJet have called for government funding to develop hydrogen flying suitable for short-haul flights, there are obstacles to making regular commercial flights a reality.

Providing enough hydrogen for the plane journeys from renewable sources will be challenging, as will transporting the fuel, and reworking airport infrastructure for hydrogen refuelling.

Plans for hydrogen aircraft are at least a decade away, with Airbus saying it wants to get a 100-seat hydrogen plane in the air by 2035 - although Back Heathrow's estimates for a third runway have flights taking off in 2034.

For now, rising emissions from flying are risking the UK's climate targets, according to the independent government advisers of the Climate Change Committee, who found flights contribute more greenhouse gas than the entire electricity supply sector.

Expanding at 'full capacity'

On the first page of the newsletter, Back Heathrow says ""Heathrow is at full capacity"", but the company told Sky News the airport has been ""operating at 98% capacity since 2005"".

Despite its 98% capacity, Heathrow Airport has broken passenger number records every year for the past 14 years - excluding the pandemic years of 2020 to 2023.

Dr Chapman said Heathrow is at capacity regarding the government-imposed flight cap, not at the capacity of the current runway infrastructure.

""So if the government were, for example, to lift that cap on the number of aircraft movements, it's pretty likely that they could actually fly 10% to 20% more flights out of the existing infrastructure,"" he said.

As aeroplanes have expanded to carry more passengers, the airport has welcomed more people, he added.

The airport earlier this month announced plans to increase its capacity by 10 million passengers a year, before a third runway is built, and to raise the charge paid by passengers to fund the investment.

How have the group and the airport responded?

A Heathrow spokesperson said: ""Back Heathrow represents tens of thousands of local people who want to make their views known on the importance of Heathrow to their communities and livelihoods today and into the future.

""We have always been clear that, alongside individual residents, local business groups and trade unions, we provide funding for Back Heathrow to provide a voice for local people who historically have not been heard in the debate about expanding Heathrow.""

Speaking for the campaign group, Mr Dhanda said: ""At Back Heathrow we are proud of our link to Heathrow Airport (the clue is in the name).

Il Seminole DX è nato da una proficua collaborazione tra Piper e DeltaHawk, annunciata all’inizio del 2024.

“Il motore DeltaHawk turbocompresso da 180 cavalli, raffreddato a liquido, offre turbine performance con una fuel efficiency superiore del 40% rispetto agli avgas engines, ottenendo al contempo una significativa riduzione dei costi di gestione grazie al minor numero di parti mobili. Il motore è omologato per JET A e JET A-1, in attesa dell’approvazione per Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Piper utilizzerà un Piper-owned STC per integrare i DeltaHawk firewall-forward kits nella linea di produzione del Seminole. Il kit include counter-rotating DeltaHawk engines and three-blade, full-feather propellers. Inoltre, il velivolo sarà dotato di un avanzato sistema di controllo della temperatura in cabina che utilizza il raffreddamento a liquido dei motori per garantire un’esperienza di volo confortevole in diverse condizioni”, afferma Piper.

“Il mercato ha ascoltato con forza la necessità di una reliable, cost-effective, heavy fuel, multi-engine training platform”, afferma John Calcagno, President and CEO of Piper Aircraft, Inc. “Il nuovo Seminole DX colma perfettamente questa lacuna di mercato. Sulla base dell’interesse riscontrato dall’annuncio del nostro Memorandum d’intesa lo scorso anno, prevediamo che la domanda globale per il Seminole DX si attesterà tra i 25 e i 40 velivoli all’anno nei prossimi 10 anni. È stato un piacere collaborare con il team DeltaHawk negli ultimi 16 mesi, poiché incarna la qualità e l’attenzione al cliente. Sono in corso anche future collaborazioni”.

“Un 20-year Long Term Supply Agreement (LTSA) designa DeltaHawk come esclusivo heavy fuel, piston engine supplier per il Piper Seminole. I test di volo per la certificazione inizieranno a novembre 2025, con la certificazione FAA prevista per il terzo trimestre 2026, seguita dalle certificazioni di Transport Canada, EASA e della DGCA indiana. Le consegne dei 2027 model year Seminole DX aircraft dovrebbero iniziare tra la fine del 2026 e l’inizio del 2027″, prosegue Piper.

“L’installazione del nostro motore DHK certificato sul leggendario Piper Seminole si sposa perfettamente con le nostre caratteristiche uniche nel settore, offrendo il costo di proprietà più basso e la piattaforma di addestramento multimotore più semplice e sicura di sempre”, ha dichiarato Christopher Ruud, Chief Executive Officer of DeltaHawk Engines. “Altrettanto importante, consideriamo questo nuovo accordo ventennale non solo in termini di motori, ma anche come un passo straordinario da parte di Piper, che sfrutta la potente innovazione di DeltaHawk, creando al contempo la sostenibilità ambientale per l’aviazione generale in tutto il mondo”.

“Il Seminole DX offre significativi miglioramenti delle performance rispetto all’attuale PA-44 Seminole, tra cui una riduzione del 35% del consumo di carburante, un aumento del 32% del single-engine climb rate e un single-engine absolute ceiling superiore del 70%”, conclude Piper.

Piper Aircraft ha comunicato ulteriori ordini e annunci durante l’EAA AirVenture 2025 in Oshkosh.

Piper Aircraft si aggiudica il più grande Domestic Trainer Order nella storia dell’azienda

Piper Aircraft annuncia oggi uno storico nuovo fleet agreement per un massimo di 188 velivoli, del valore di circa 155 milioni di dollari, con la University of North Dakota John D.

The electrolyser converts carbon dioxide and water into precursors that can then ultimately be turned into green fuel for aircraft.
The team have already developed a carbon dioxide electrolyser system using low-cost transition metal and carbon catalysts, which can be integrated with the well-established Fischer-Tropsch process to produce sustainable aviation fuel.
“Our goal is to revolutionise how we produce clean fuels for aviation, using renewable energy to transform CO₂ into usable fuels without requiring costly infrastructure changes.
“This partnership is a major step towards scaling the cutting-edge electrolyser technology.","UNSW researchers are set to scale up a next-generation electrolyser system that helps produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using renewable energy, thanks to a $1.2 million grant from the TRaCE Lab to Market Fund. The electrolyser converts carbon dioxide and water into precursors that can then ultimately be turned into green fuel for aircraft.

The funding from TRaCE, the Trailblazer for Recycling and Clean Energy program established by the Australian Department of Education, has been boosted by industry partners to total $4.2 million, with the aim of achieving a critical breakthrough in the reduction of emissions in aviation.

The UNSW-led project, involving Dr Rahman Daiyan, Scientia Professor Rose Amal, and adjunct Professor Jimmy Yun, will work in association with Australian partner Tjindu Power and Chuangqi Times (Qingdao) Technology Company, a clean tech developer based in China.

The team have already developed a carbon dioxide electrolyser system using low-cost transition metal and carbon catalysts, which can be integrated with the well-established Fischer-Tropsch process to produce sustainable aviation fuel.

Decarbonising aviation is one of the toughest challenges in the race to net zero. Unlike cars or homes, planes can’t easily switch to be electrified and the fuels they burn release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Globally, aviation accounts for about 2-3% of emissions, but it’s a fast-growing sector with limited alternatives. Many emerging clean energy technologies aim to replace fossil fuel production with sustainable aviation fuels and e-fuels but these solutions are still expensive, energy-intensive, and not yet ready for mass deployment.

“Our goal is to revolutionise how we produce clean fuels for aviation, using renewable energy to transform CO₂ into usable fuels without requiring costly infrastructure changes. This technology could be the key to decarbonising aviation, one of the world’s most challenging sectors,” said Dr Daiyan, a Scientia Fellow in the School of Mineral and Energy Resources Engineering, and Lead Chief Investigator at UNSW.

Scientia Prof. Amal, from the School of Chemical Engineering, added: “This breakthrough proves that with smart catalyst design and integrated system thinking, we can transform waste CO₂ into the very fuels that drive our economy. It’s the kind of scalable innovation we need to tackle hard-to-abate sectors and achieve net zero.”

The grant from TRaCE will help to move the technology from TRL 4 (proof-of-concept in the lab) to TRL 6 (validated prototype in a relevant environment).

A spin-out company, Gurung Fuel, led by the industry partners, has been created to lead commercialisation, stakeholder engagement, and capital raising.

“This partnership is a major step towards scaling the cutting-edge electrolyser technology. We’re not just developing a solution, we are creating a game-changer for the aviation industry, with the potential to make a global impact,” said Prof. Yun from Chuangqi Times (Qingdao).

The research project is a strategic opportunity for Australia, which is facing a critical challenge in its fuel security.

Currently, the nation holds only 48 days’ worth of fuel reserves – far below the 90 days required by international standards. The nation’s heavy reliance on imported fuel also makes it vulnerable to global disruptions and recent geopolitical crises have underscored the urgent need for a sustainable and self-sufficient solution.",https://asianaviation.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC_9829-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 23:56:22.022866

Společnost DSV pokračuje ve své strategii snižování emisí v dopravě a rozšiřuje využití alternativních paliv. Kromě elektrifikace své globální flotily a úspěšného nasazení vozidel na HVO (hydrogenovaný rostlinný olej) se zaměřuje také na další biopaliva, jako je SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) pro leteckou a FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Esters) pro námořní přepravu. Udržitelná logistika zůstává prioritou i ve druhé polovině roku 2025. Předpokládá se také další rozšíření využití umělé inteligence, přičemž společnost DSV zároveň klade důraz na přizpůsobení se globálním změnám v obchodních podmínkách, jako je vliv nových celních opatření, nevyjasněná situace v Rudém moři či přesouvání dodavatelských řetězců do blízkých zemí neboli nearshoring.

Společnost DSV se přizpůsobuje rostoucímu důrazu na ESG standardy (měřítka pro hodnocení a porovnávání udržitelnosti firem v oblasti životního prostředí, sociální odpovědnosti a správy). Zákazníci stále více požadují transparentní informace o environmentálním dopadu přepravy a upřednostňují nízkoemisní řešení. Jedním z nízkoemisních řešeních, které DSV Česká republika již několik měsíců provozuje, jsou velkokapacitní soupravy na HVO a plánuje rozšíření využití tohoto paliva na další trasy.

5 měsíců zkušeností s HVO

„Pokračujeme ve využívání alternativního paliva HVO na nočních hlavních distribučních linkách DSV v CZ s cílem přispět ke snížení emisí CO2 z provozu nákladních vozidel. Díky velké části zákazníků DSV, kteří nepatrnou částkou tzv. environmentálního příplatku nám pomáhají společně se podílet na šetrnějším způsobu přepravy, jsme za 5 měsíců uspořili 190 tis. kg CO2, ekvivalent této hmotnosti je cca 29 slonů. Po tuto dobu jsme společně s našimi dopravci hledali optimální řešení pro rozšíření použití HVO paliva i pro další dálkové linky DSV v ČR. Pokud nám to dovolí pomalu se zlepšující situace v oblasti přeprav, tak pro 2.polovinu roku 2025 jsme odhodlaní pokrýt až 80% tuzemských linek DSV tímto palivem. Dosáhli bychom tak měsíční úspory kolem 10 slonů (cca 66,6 tis. kg) CO2. V současné době se v DSV CZ připravujeme na provoz čistě elektrických tahačů Volvo pro provoz v dedikovaném nastavení pro významného klienta. To by mělo být dalším konkrétním přispěním DSV k modernímu pojetí příměstské a vnitrostátní logistice. Jsme přesvědčeni o správnosti přístupu využitím širší škály úsporných vozidel a alternativních pohonů, které mohou ve vhodné kombinaci posunout přepravní logistiku směrem ke skutečné dlouhodobé udržitelnosti s přímým dopadem na lepší životní prostředí nás všech,“ říká Petr Chocholatý, ředitel provozu DSV Road Česká republika.

HVO se osvědčilo jako efektivní alternativa tam, kde zatím není dostatečná infrastruktura pro elektro vozy. Česká síť čerpacích stanic s HVO se navíc rozrůstá rychleji než síť elektro stanic pro nákladní dopravu, což z něj činí realistické řešení pro každodenní využití. Na rozdíl od tradičních fosilních paliv, jako je nafta, mají udržitelná paliva podobné provozní vlastnosti, ale výrazně nižší uhlíkovou stopu. Vyrábějí se z biologicky odbouratelných nebo odpadních surovin a jejich použití snižuje nejen přímé emise CO₂, ale také celkové dopady na životní prostředí, které jsou spojeny s těžbou a zpracováním ropy.

„I když jsou provozní náklady spojené s HVO výrazně vyšší než u dieselových tahačů, palivo se v našich podmínkách osvědčilo jako spolehlivé, efektivní a ekologické řešení – zejména tam, kde zatím není možné nebo ekonomicky výhodné nasadit elektrická vozidla. Rozšíření na další trasy a podpora budování infrastruktury jsou přirozeným krokem, který nám pomáhá naplňovat naše emisní cíle,“ dodává pan Chocholatý.

Redukce emisí i u letecké a námořní dopravy

Na globální úrovni se DSV stále intenzivněji zapojuje do projektů snižování emisí také v oblasti letecké a námořní dopravy. V letectví sleduje vývoj SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel – udržitelné letecké palivo), které může snížit emise CO₂ až o 80 % oproti konvenčnímu kerosinu (standardně využívané letecké palivo). SAF se vyrábí z obnovitelných zdrojů, jako jsou biologické odpady, použité oleje nebo zemědělské zbytky, a je přímo použitelný v současných letadlech bez nutnosti technických úprav. DSV již v roce 2023 uskutečnilo iniciativu, kdy se rozhodlo absolvovat veškeré své služební lety výhradně s využitím biopaliva SAF. Podobně se v námořní dopravě otevírá prostor pro FAME – biopalivo druhé generace, jehož využití je ve fázi pilotního nasazení.

Co očekávat ve druhé polovině roku 2025

Logistický sektor bude ve druhé polovině roku 2025 čelit několika dalším klíčovým výzvám i příležitostem. Jednou z nich je stále pokračující rozvoj digitalizace a umělé inteligence v logistice. Tyto technologie se stávají klíčovými nástroji pro zvyšování efektivity. Umělá inteligence umožní nejen prediktivní modely pro optimalizaci tras a snížení nákladů, ale také sledování přepravy v reálném čase, což pomůže lépe reagovat na aktuální podmínky a optimalizovat logistické procesy. AI dokáže pomáhat i v oblasti bezpečnosti. Například pro monitoring chování řidičů, což umožní včasné upozornění na rizikové chování a přispěje k zajištění většího bezpečí na cestách. Dále bude pokračovat nasazování autonomních strojů ve skladech, které zvýší produktivitu a flexibilitu, a zároveň minimalizují lidskou chybu v náročných skladovacích procesech.

„Věříme, že nám všechny tyto kroky pomohou ke splnění globálního cíle pro rok 2025, kterým je snížení emisí z přepravních a logistických činností o 8 %. Tento cíl je součástí širší strategie postupné dekarbonizace, která zahrnuje investice do alternativních paliv, elektrifikaci vozového parku a spolupráci s partnery na ekologických řešeních napříč celým dodavatelským řetězcem. Skrze tyto dílčí kroky bychom měli do roku 2050 naplnit náš závazek k dosažení nulových emisí – a to jak v rámci vlastního provozu, tak i napříč celým hodnotovým řetězcem,“ dodává pan Chocholatý.

Situace na mezinárodní scéně

Důležité zůstává dění v Suezském průplavu, kde začátkem května došlo k uzavření příměří mezi jemenskými povstalci Húthíi a americkou vládou, která na Húthíjské jednotky podnikla od března letošního roku několik masivních útoků. Dohoda stanovuje, že strany na sebe nebudou v Rudém moři a úžině Báb Al-Mandab vzájemně útočit, což by mělo zajistit svobodu plavby a plynulou mezinárodní námořní dopravu. Příměří by se však nemělo vztahovat na útoky proti Izraeli. “V druhé polovině roku 2025 očekáváme, že tato situace přinese stabilizaci obchodních tras, ale zůstávají obavy o možné eskalace napětí v jiných částech regionu. Vliv této dohody na globální logistiku může být zásadní, zejména vzhledem k pokračujícímu napětí v širším Blízkém východě a rostoucí dynamice geopolitických vztahů, zejména mezi USA, Íránem a Izraelem. Hormuzský průliv je strategická úžina spojující Perský záliv s Arabským mořem, zůstává sice otevřený, ale je pod zvýšeným bezpečnostním dohledem a tlakem. Vzhledem k rostoucímu riziku eskalace konfliktu začínají rejdařské společnosti přehodnocovat své trasy a aktivovat krizové plány. Některé společnosti se z opatrnosti vyhýbají plavbě v Rudém moři, Perském zálivu a právě v Hormuzském průlivu. Neustále sledujeme vývoj situace a v případě nutnosti okamžitě zavádíme opatření, která zajistí co nejvyšší bezpečnost a omezí případné dopady na minimum,“ dodává Jukl.

Dalším faktorem, který bude nutné sledovat, jsou kroky americké vlády v oblasti celní politiky, jež mají za cíl chránit domácí trh. Tato nepředvídatelná a dynamická situace vytváří pro logistické společnosti a obchodníky značné výzvy, zejména kvůli nejistotě, rostoucím nákladům a administrativnímu zatížení. Nejvíce se o amerických clech diskutuje v souvislosti s Čínou, odkud dováží výrobky větší i menší mezinárodní obchodní hráči. Nejasná celní politika může vést k přesouvání dodavatelských řetězců mimo Čínu a posílení nearshoring, tedy přesun výroby blíže k evropským trhům. To by mohlo znamenat zvýšenou poptávku po logistických službách v Evropě. „Stále více našich zákazníků přesouvá výrobu blíže k evropským trhům. Nearshoring výrazně zkracuje dodací lhůty, snižuje rizika a zvyšuje flexibilitu dodavatelských řetězců,“ uvádí Jiří Moravec, ředitel oddělení Sales & Marketing, DSV Air & Sea.

In an industry where governance can make or break resilience, Singapore Airlines' transformation under Goh Swee Chen is a testament to the power of strategic oversight.","The aviation sector, long characterized by volatile market conditions and regulatory scrutiny, has seen a quiet revolution in corporate governance. At the forefront of this transformation is Singapore Airlines (SIA), a global aviation icon, which has recently restructured its board to align with evolving investor expectations. Central to this shift is the appointment of Goh Swee Chen as Lead Independent Director in 2019, a move that has catalyzed a strategic reorientation in board oversight, corporate accountability, and long-term value creation. For investors, this evolution presents a compelling case for reassessing SIA's governance framework and its implications for shareholder returns.

A Governance Overhaul: From Shell to the Skies

Goh Swee Chen's appointment was no accident. With a 16-year tenure as Chairperson of Shell Companies in Singapore and a career spanning multinational giants like Procter & Gamble and IBM, she brought a rare blend of operational rigor and cross-sector expertise. Her global experience—across markets such as China, the Netherlands, and the U.S.—provided her with a nuanced understanding of corporate governance in complex, regulated industries. This background proved invaluable for SIA, which, post-pandemic, faced the dual challenges of financial recovery and sustainability-driven transformation.

As Lead Independent Director, Ms. Goh chairs the Board Nominating Committee and sits on the Audit and Customer Experience, Technology, and Sustainability Committees. Her leadership has prioritized three pillars: board diversity, sustainability integration, and stakeholder-centric governance. For instance, under her stewardship, SIA has strengthened its ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) disclosures, a critical factor in today's ESG-driven markets.

ESG and Investor Confidence: A Data-Driven Perspective

SIA's ESG performance, as measured by S&P Global's Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA), reflects this strategic pivot. As of July 2025, SIA holds an ESG score of 51 out of 100, up from a pre-2023 score of 39. While still below the industry's top performers (which average 62), this upward trajectory is significant. The airline's 85% disclosure rate on CSA Required Public Data—a metric that evaluates transparency in ESG practices—suggests a commitment to accountability.

Ms. Goh's influence is evident in SIA's sustainability initiatives. The airline's 2024 partnership with Aether Fuels for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and its $1.1 billion Airbus A350 retrofit program are directly aligned with her committee's focus on decarbonization. These moves not only address regulatory pressures but also cater to a growing cohort of ESG-conscious investors.

Strategic Oversight and Shareholder Value

The question remains: How does this governance evolution translate to shareholder value? While SIA's stock price remains below pre-pandemic levels (trading at ~S$7.00 as of July 2025, compared to ~S$10 in 2019), the airline's capital structure tells a different story. Post-2023, SIA has prioritized conservative debt management and strategic reinvestment, with a focus on technology and customer experience. The $45 million investment in Changi Terminal 2 lounges and the AI-driven customer service overhaul (via OpenAI partnerships) signal a long-term vision to retain premium customers in a competitive market.

Moreover, Ms. Goh's emphasis on board diversity—evidenced by her role in the Council for Board Diversity—has likely enhanced decision-making quality. A 2024 study by the Singapore Institute of Directors found that companies with diverse boards outperformed peers by 12% in ROE over a five-year period. For SIA, this could mean a gradual but sustainable return to profitability as recovery gains momentum.

Risks and Considerations

Investors should not ignore the challenges. The aviation sector remains cyclical, and SIA's reliance on high-yield premium routes exposes it to geopolitical and economic shocks. Additionally, while ESG scores are improving, SIA's 31/49 score on CSA Required Public Data (a subset of the overall ESG score) indicates room for improvement in areas like carbon offsetting and labor practices.

However, Ms. Goh's track record in navigating complex transitions—such as Shell's shift to renewable energy—suggests a board capable of addressing these headwinds. Her dual roles on the Monetary Authority of Singapore's board and JTC Corporation's sustainability committees further reinforce her ability to align SIA's strategy with national economic goals.

Investment Thesis: Buy or Hold?

For long-term investors, SIA's governance renaissance under Ms. Goh's leadership offers a compelling case. The airline's focus on ESG, technological innovation, and board accountability aligns with global trends that are likely to drive institutional investor interest. While the stock's current valuation (~10x trailing earnings) reflects caution, the company's balance sheet strength and strategic clarity position it for a recovery in 2026–2027.

Recommendation: A ""Hold"" for now, with a target price of S$8.50 by mid-2026. Investors should monitor SIA's Q3 2025 ESG report and its 2026 capital allocation decisions for signs of accelerated value creation.

In an industry where governance can make or break resilience, Singapore Airlines' transformation under Goh Swee Chen is a testament to the power of strategic oversight.

Inoltre, sostiene il raggiungimento degli obiettivi nazionali per la produzione di biocarburanti in purezza, che secondo la normativa vigente prevedono un incremento progressivo dell’utilizzo, da 300.000 tonnellate annue nel 2023 fino a un milione di tonnellate entro il 2030”.","La Banca europea per gli investimenti e Eni hanno firmato un contratto di finanziamento da 500 milioni di euro a 15 anni per sostenere la conversione della raffineria Eni di Livorno in bioraffineria, conversione che ne farà uno stabilimento decisivo per la produzione di carburanti dedicati al trasporto.

“Il progetto di Eni prevede la costruzione nel sito della raffineria di Livorno di nuovi impianti per la produzione di biocarburanti idrogenati, incluso un’unità di pretrattamento delle cariche biogeniche e un impianto Ecofining da 500mila tonnellate/anno” ha infatti spiegato una nota di Eni: “Grazie alla tecnologia proprietaria Ecofining, Enilive, società di Eni per la mobilità sostenibile, produce l’Hvo (olio vegetale idrogenato), un biocarburante da materie prime rinnovabili, come ad esempio gli oli da cottura e residui dell’industria agroalimentare, che può essere sin da ora utilizzato in purezza dalle motorizzazioni validate e viene distribuito attraverso le infrastrutture già esistenti”.

Secondo Eni i biocarburanti Hvo hanno un ruolo fondamentale perché possono dare un contributo immediato alla riduzione delle emissioni (calcolate lungo l’intera catena del valore) del settore dei trasporti non solo su strada, ma anche per il trasporto aereo, marittimo e ferroviario. La conversione del sito di Livorno è in linea con la strategia di Enilive di aumentare la produzione di biocarburanti a fronte dalla crescente domanda in Europa e in Italia, sia per gli obiettivi di riduzione delle emissioni previsti dalla Red III (Renewable Energy Directive), sia per gli obblighi di immissione al consumo di biocarburanti in purezza definiti dalla normativa italiana. A livello globale, le stime prevedono che la domanda di biocarburanti idrogenati aumenterà del 65% nel periodo 2024-2028”.

La bioraffineria di Livorno sarà in grado di trattare diversi tipi di cariche biogeniche, prevalentemente scarti e residui di origine vegetale, per produrre Hvo diesel, Hvo nafta e bio-Gpl: “Tra le caratteristiche distintive del progetto, oltre all’adozione di tecnologie avanzate, vi è la possibilità futura di modificare il layout dell’impianto per avere la flessibilità di produrre anche Saf (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), un carburante sostenibile per l’aviazione che rappresenta una delle principali direttrici di decarbonizzazione del trasporto aereo. Questo elemento conferisce flessibilità all’investimento e ne rafforza la coerenza con le priorità ambientali dell’Unione europea, ampliandone l’impatto potenziale”.

La nota del cane a sei zampe precisa che “l’operazione si inserisce nel contesto della transizione energetica a livello nazionale ed europeo, contribuendo in modo significativo alla decarbonizzazione del settore dei trasporti e alla riduzione delle emissioni di CO2. Inoltre, sostiene il raggiungimento degli obiettivi nazionali per la produzione di biocarburanti in purezza, che secondo la normativa vigente prevedono un incremento progressivo dell’utilizzo, da 300.000 tonnellate annue nel 2023 fino a un milione di tonnellate entro il 2030”.

Nhiên liệu này do Synhelion – công ty công nghệ sạch tiên phong có trụ sở tại Thụy Sĩ – phát triển, đánh dấu một cột mốc quan trọng trong nỗ lực giảm phát thải và thúc đẩy nền kinh tế khử carbon trong lĩnh vực vận tải hàng không.

Cột mốc đầu tiên: 190 lít nhiên liệu mặt trời đưa vào hệ thống của SWISS

Lô nhiên liệu đầu tiên, gồm 190 lít dầu thô tổng hợp, đã được sản xuất tại cơ sở DAWN của Synhelion và chuyển đến một nhà máy lọc dầu ở miền Bắc Đức.

Tại đây, dầu thô được tinh chế thành nhiên liệu Jet-A-1 – tiêu chuẩn quốc tế cho nhiên liệu hàng không. Nhiên liệu sau đó được bơm vào hệ thống tiếp nhiên liệu của SWISS tại sân bay Hamburg.

Mặc dù lượng nhiên liệu mới chỉ đáp ứng khoảng 7% nhu cầu cho một chuyến bay Hamburg–Zurich, sự kiện này vẫn mang tính biểu tượng mạnh mẽ.

Nó chứng minh rằng công nghệ sản xuất nhiên liệu mặt trời có thể hòa nhập liền mạch với cơ sở hạ tầng và chuỗi cung ứng hiện có – yếu tố then chốt để mở rộng quy mô sản xuất toàn cầu trong tương lai.

“Đây là lần đầu tiên nhiên liệu mặt trời được sử dụng trong hàng không dân dụng. Chúng tôi rất tự hào khi đóng vai trò tiên phong cùng Synhelion trong việc biến công nghệ này thành hiện thực”, Jens Fehlinger – CEO SWISS – nhấn mạnh.

Synhelion và tham vọng tái định hình ngành năng lượng

Synhelion phát triển công nghệ sử dụng bức xạ mặt trời để sản xuất dầu thô tổng hợp, từ đó tinh chế thành nhiên liệu hàng không. Điểm nổi bật của công nghệ này là khả năng giảm mạnh lượng khí thải CO₂ so với dầu hỏa truyền thống, đồng thời tận dụng nguồn năng lượng vô tận từ mặt trời.

Đánh giá vòng đời (LCA) do tổ chức độc lập thực hiện cho thấy nhiên liệu từ cơ sở DAWN có thể giảm phát thải khí nhà kính vượt xa mức 70% theo yêu cầu của Chỉ thị Năng lượng Tái tạo của EU.

Philipp Furler, đồng sáng lập kiêm CEO Synhelion, cho biết: “Lô nhiên liệu đầu tiên chỉ mang tính biểu tượng, nhưng nó là bằng chứng rõ ràng cho thấy chúng tôi đã sẵn sàng bước sang giai đoạn mở rộng quy mô toàn cầu. Chúng tôi trân trọng sự hợp tác bền chặt với SWISS và Tập đoàn Lufthansa trong hành trình này.”

Lộ trình mở rộng: Từ thử nghiệm đến thương mại hóa năm 2027

Hiện Synhelion và SWISS đang xúc tiến chứng nhận bền vững theo tiêu chuẩn EU, đồng thời đầu tư vào cơ sở sản xuất lớn hơn. Mục tiêu là thương mại hóa nhiên liệu mặt trời vào năm 2027, đáp ứng nhu cầu ngày càng tăng của ngành hàng không.

SWISS đã trở thành đối tác chiến lược của Synhelion từ năm 2020 và chính thức đầu tư từ năm 2022. Việc đồng hành từ sớm giúp hãng bay này không chỉ tiếp cận công nghệ tiên phong mà còn đóng góp vào quá trình định hình tương lai của nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững (SAF – Sustainable Aviation Fuel).

Lufthansa và chiến lược SAF dài hạn

Với vai trò thành viên Tập đoàn Lufthansa, SWISS được thừa hưởng mạng lưới nghiên cứu và kinh nghiệm hàng chục năm trong lĩnh vực SAF. Lufthansa đã ký kết nhiều hợp đồng mua nhiên liệu dài hạn, tham gia liên minh ngành và triển khai các dự án thử nghiệm nhằm tạo động lực cho thị trường toàn cầu.

While the airline framed these cuts as part of a “finalized schedule” set 100 days in advance, the move exposed deeper vulnerabilities: a legal battle with Chicago over gate access, staffing shortages, and shifting demand patterns. For investors, this episode is not just a blip but a window into the broader challenges and opportunities facing the post-pandemic airline sector.

Operational Disruptions and Gate Wars: A Recipe for Short-Term Pain

O'Hare, one of the world's busiest airports, has long been a linchpin for American Airlines' transcontinental and international operations. The August cuts—most severe on routes to Phoenix, Detroit, and Newark—were partly attributed to a lawsuit against Chicago officials, who allegedly violated a 2018 agreement by granting United Airlines five additional gates. American's potential loss of four gates at ORD could limit its ability to scale operations during peak travel periods.

Such gate constraints, combined with staffing shortages and weather-related disruptions (storms at hubs like Dallas-Fort Worth and Chicago spiked operational issues by 36% year-over-year in Q2 2025), forced American to reduce capacity. While the airline claims these cuts were pre-announced in May, passengers and investors alike perceive them as reactive. The result? Reduced availability on key routes, higher fares for remaining flights, and a dent in customer trust.

Profitability Under Pressure: A Tale of Two Margins

American's Q2 2025 financials reveal a mixed picture. Revenue hit a record $14.4 billion, driven by strong leisure demand and premium cabin performance. Yet operating margins contracted to 8%, down from previous quarters, as operational disruptions inflated costs. Fuel prices fell to $86/barrel in 2025 (vs. $99 in 2024), but this relief was offset by $38 billion in total debt and a $29 billion net debt load.

The airline's liquidity—$12 billion in available cash and credit—offers a buffer, but its free cash flow ($791 million in Q2) pales against the $25 billion in annual fuel costs. For context, the industry's net profit margin in 2025 is projected at 3.7%, with American's 8% margin appearing robust in isolation but fragile against macroeconomic headwinds. Rising interest rates and potential rate hikes could further strain its debt-heavy balance sheet.

Broader Industry Trends: A Post-Pandemic Paradox

American's struggles mirror a sector-wide recalibration. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts $36 billion in global airline profits for 2025, up from $32.4 billion in 2024, but this growth is tempered by supply chain bottlenecks, a 17,000-aircraft backlog, and rising costs for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Meanwhile, demand remains resilient: 4.99 billion travelers are expected in 2025, but yields are declining as airlines compete for a shrinking pool of premium customers.

The August flight reductions by American, United, JetBlue, and Avelo highlight a strategic shift toward leaner networks. Airlines are prioritizing high-demand routes over low-yield corridors, a move that could stabilize margins but risks alienating business and leisure travelers accustomed to frequent departures. For investors, this signals a sector prioritizing efficiency over growth—a trend that may persist through 2026.

Investor Sentiment: Between Resilience and Skepticism

American's stock price dropped 7.85% in pre-market trading after its Q2 earnings report, despite beating EPS estimates by 21.79%. The disconnect underscores investor wariness: while revenue and liquidity are strong, operational volatility and legal disputes cast doubt on long-term stability. The airline's 16.5% increase in weekly flights at O'Hare for August—a response to added routes like Naples and Mexico City—may offset some cuts, but the broader message is clear: flexibility is now a premium commodity.

The Road Ahead: Strategic Moves in a Fragile Environment

American's bet on new destinations (e.g., Naples, Queretaro) and expanded services to popular leisure markets could drive long-term growth. Its 6.7% year-over-year increase in AAdvantage credit card spending and 7% rise in active loyalty accounts suggest a strong value proposition for premium customers. However, the airline must navigate near-term risks:

1. Gate Access: Resolving the Chicago legal dispute is critical to regaining operational flexibility at O'Hare.

2. Debt Management: With $38 billion in total debt, American must balance fleet modernization with cost control.

3. Sustainability Costs: As SAF becomes a regulatory imperative, its 4.2x price premium over jet fuel could erode margins.

Investment Thesis: A Cautious Bull Case

For investors, American Airlines represents a high-conviction opportunity in a sector transitioning from crisis to equilibrium. Its strong liquidity, strategic route additions, and focus on premium services position it to outperform peers in 2026. However, the airline's reliance on O'Hare and its debt load warrant caution. A buy recommendation is justified for those comfortable with a 12–18-month time horizon and a 15–20% margin of safety.

In the end, American's story is emblematic of the airline industry's post-pandemic journey: a mix of resilience, reinvention, and relentless adaptation to forces beyond its control. For now, the skies remain bumpy—but not without promise.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-26 14:56:45.149405

While the move reflects short-term headwinds in the renewable fuels and RIN markets, a deeper analysis reveals a compelling case for contrarian value investors to consider the stock's long-term potential. This article examines how regulatory tailwinds, strategic diversification, and undervaluation metrics could position DAR for a rebound, despite current challenges.

Short-Term Headwinds: A Cautionary Lens

The downgrade was triggered by Darling's Q2 2025 earnings shortfall ($0.08 vs. $0.30 expected) and revenue miss ($1.48B vs. $1.49B expected). Key concerns include:

- Regulatory Uncertainty: Ongoing debates over small refiner exemptions under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) have created ambiguity in the RIN market, a critical revenue driver for Darling's fuel segment.

- Margin Compression: Weakness in Renewable Identification Number (RIN) pricing and declining DGD EBITDA (a 10% drop year-over-year) have eroded near-term profitability.

- Strategic Visibility: Analysts cite limited clarity on how policy shifts and market dynamics will impact Darling's 2025 guidance.

Long-Term Strategic Positioning: A Contrarian Case

Despite these challenges, Darling's long-term fundamentals align with growing demand for sustainable solutions. Three pillars underpin its strategic resilience:

1. Renewable Fuels Leadership: Darling remains a key player in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and biodiesel production. The proposed Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO) framework and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) reforms are expected to bolster demand for low-carbon fuels, creating a tailwind for the company's core business.

2. Diversification into High-Margin Sectors: The formation of NexTata, a joint venture in the health and wellness space, targets high-growth markets like collagen and gelatin. Early results show strong repeat orders, signaling potential for recurring revenue streams.

3. Regulatory Tailwinds: Rising U.S. fat prices, driven by policy incentives and tariffs, and the anticipated resolution of SRE issues could normalize margins in the renewable fuels sector.

Valuation Metrics: A Contrarian's Edge

Darling's valuation appears attractive when viewed through a contrarian lens:

- Price-to-Book (P/B): At 1.22, the company trades at a 34% discount to its industry average of 1.99, suggesting undervaluation relative to tangible assets.

- Price-to-Cash Flow (P/CF): A ratio of 8.93, well below the industry average of 14.67, indicates strong cash flow generation despite earnings volatility.

- Analyst Consensus: A 14-analyst average price target of $48.95 implies a 39% upside from current levels, with six firms maintaining “Outperform” or “Strong Buy” ratings.

However, investors must weigh these metrics against the company's high leverage (debt-to-EBITDA of 5.04) and a beta of 1.23, reflecting above-market volatility.

Regulatory-Driven Growth: The Irrefutable Tailwind

The renewable fuels sector is on the cusp of structural growth. Policy frameworks like the RVO and LCFS are designed to reduce carbon intensity, creating a $100+ billion market for SAF and biofuels by 2030. Darling's expertise in feedstock processing and its partnerships (e.g., Diamond Green Diesel) position it to capture a significant share of this growth.

Investment Thesis: Balancing Risks and Rewards

For contrarian value investors, the Baird downgrade presents an opportunity to buy into a company with strong long-term fundamentals at a discount. Key risks include:

- Regulatory Delays: Prolonged uncertainty around RFS exemptions or LCFS adjustments could delay margin recovery.

- Market Volatility: The stock's beta of 1.23 suggests sensitivity to macroeconomic shifts, such as interest rate hikes or energy price swings.

However, the potential rewards are substantial:

- Margin Expansion: A resolution of RIN market dynamics and SRE issues could normalize margins, driving EBITDA growth.

- Strategic Diversification: NexTata's entry into the health and wellness sector offers a hedge against fuel market volatility.

Conclusion: A Calculated Bet for Long-Term Investors

While the Baird downgrade underscores near-term challenges, it also creates a compelling entry point for investors focused on long-term value. Darling's strategic alignment with regulatory trends, undervalued metrics, and diversification into high-margin sectors justify a cautious bullish stance. For those willing to endure short-term volatility, the stock offers a unique opportunity to capitalize on the renewable fuels revolution.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-26 13:56:32.264571

Parler de transition verte dans le domaine aérien peut sembler être un ""jeu réservé aux riches"", tant les coûts engagés sont élevés. Pourtant, l’aviation vietnamienne poursuit avec détermination sa trajectoire ""verte"", portée par l’esprit de ""Transformation, sacrifices et développement durable"".

Un mouvement mondial irréversible

Le monde traverse actuellement une période de transition énergétique marquée par des bouleversements et des incertitudes. Les politiques climatiques internationales ne sont pas toujours cohérentes.

À titre d’exemple, les États-Unis, sous la présidence de Donald Trump, se sont officiellement retirés de l’Accord de Paris sur le climat.

Cependant, dans un apparent paradoxe, les États-Unis ont continué de participer à des mécanismes techniques spécifiques, tels que le dispositif de compensation et de réduction des émissions de carbone pour l’aviation internationale (CORSIA) mis en place par l’Organisation de l’aviation civile internationale (OACI). Par ailleurs, les subventions à la recherche et au développement de carburants durables pour l’aviation (connus sous le nom de SAF - Sustainable Aviation Fuel) n’ont jamais cessé, ce qui démontre une orientation technologique et économique désormais difficilement réversible, transcendant les fluctuations politiques de court terme.

Dans ce contexte, le Vietnam affirme pleinement son engagement en tant que membre responsable de la communauté internationale.

L’engagement ferme du Vietnam pris dans le cadre de la 26e Conférence des Parties à la Convention-cadre des Nations unies sur les changements climatiques (COP26), qui consiste à atteindre la neutralité carbone (Net Zéro) d’ici 2050, constitue une déclaration politique décisive, permettant de redéfinir la stratégie de développement national.

Cet engagement ne se limite pas à une simple annonce, il se traduit progressivement en stratégies, plans et actions concrètes dans tous les domaines, sous la direction énergique du Parti et du gouvernement.

Plus récemment, dans son message politique émis lors du Sommet du partenariat pour la croissance verte et les objectifs mondiaux 2030 (P4G) tenu au Vietnam, le secrétaire général du Parti communiste du Vietnam, Tô Lâm, a réaffirmé la vision stratégique du pays dans la construction de trois piliers fondamentaux pour une croissance verte, que sont : des institutions vertes comme fondement, des technologies vertes comme moteur de percée, et des ressources humaines vertes comme facteur clé.

Cette vision sert de boussole pour l’ensemble du processus de transition, dans lequel le secteur de l’aviation joue un rôle important.

Vers l’objectif de 30% des émissions de carbone

Un fait méconnu est que la transition verte du secteur aérien vietnamien ne commence pas seulement avec l'apparition des termes tels que CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation - régime de compensation et de réduction de carbone pour l'aviation internationale) ou SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel - carburants d'aviation durables).

Photo : CTV/CVN

Au contraire, ce secteur a déjà connu une première phase de transition s’étalant sur plusieurs années, une démarche discrète mais extrêmement efficace en faveur de la réduction des émissions de carbone.

Le principal moteur de cette phase réside dans les choix commerciaux et l’optimisation des opérations, où les exigences de sécurité et de sûreté aérienne doivent aller de pair avec les avantages économiques et environnementaux.

Cette période a créé un ""tremplin"" de réduction des émissions important, tout en démontrant les capacités technologiques et de gestion du secteur. Cependant, le succès de cette phase ""gagnant-gagnant"" pourrait involontairement masquer les énormes défis financiers et technologiques de la phase suivante, une phase qui exigera des investissements directs et le sacrifice des bénéfices immédiats.

L'une des solutions les plus efficaces pour réduire les émissions est d'investir dans de nouvelles générations d'avions, plus économes en carburant et plus respectueux de l'environnement. Les compagnies aériennes vietnamiennes ont été très proactives à cet égard, considérant cela comme une double décision stratégique, car cela améliore leur compétitivité et leur permet d’assumer leur responsabilité environnementale.

Vietnam Airlines, en tant que compagnie aérienne nationale, a été pionnière dans l'investissement dans les dernières générations d'avions gros-porteurs.

Elle est devenue l'une des premières compagnies de la région Asie-Pacifique à exploiter simultanément les deux types d'avions modernes, le Boeing 787 Dreamliner et l'Airbus A350 XWB.

Ces avions offrent non seulement une meilleure expérience de vol aux passagers, mais ont également une consommation de carburant inférieure de 25% par rapport aux générations précédentes, réduisant directement une grande quantité d'émissions de CO2.

Pendant ce temps, Vietjet Air s'est concentrée sur l'optimisation de sa flotte d'avions monocouloirs avec l'Airbus A321neo.

Il est considéré comme l'un des modèles d'avions à couloir unique les plus efficaces au monde, capable de réduire plus de 5.000 tonnes d'émissions de CO2 par an et par avion et de réduire le bruit de 50% par rapport aux avions de l'ancienne génération.

L’adoption des moteurs GTF de Pratt & Whitney pour la flotte d’A321neo permet à la compagnie d'économiser de l’ordre de 15 - 17% de carburant, contribuant ainsi de manière significative à sa stratégie de développement durable et à l’objectif national de neutralité carbone d’ici 2050.

Parallèlement au renouvellement de la flotte, une véritable révolution dans la gestion du trafic aérien a été mise en œuvre de manière efficace, à travers une modernisation du contrôle aérien et l’optimisation des opérations aéroportuaires, conformément à la feuille de route technologique de l’OACI (Organisation de l'aviation civile mondiale).

L’application de la navigation basée sur les performances (Performance-Based Navigation - PBN) permet aux avions de suivre des trajectoires optimisées grâce aux systèmes de navigation par satellite, au lieu de suivre des itinéraires fixes basés sur des stations de navigation au sol.

Cette évolution permet de raccourcir les distances de vol, de réduire le temps de vol, et donc de diminuer la consommation de carburant et les émissions polluantes.

Consolider le réseau aérien national

Le Vietnam a élaboré une feuille de route et met actuellement en œuvre le PBN dans l’ensemble des 22 aéroports du pays, dans le but de renforcer les capacités et l’efficacité du réseau aérien national.

Par ailleurs, Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) est une plateforme numérique permettant aux différentes parties prenantes opérant dans les aéroports (exploitants aéroportuaires, services de contrôle aérien, compagnies aériennes, prestataires de services au sol) de partager les informations et de prendre des décisions en temps réel.

Photo : VNAirlines

La mise en œuvre réussie de l’A-CDM dans les deux plus grands aéroports du pays, à savoir Nôi Bài et Tân Son Nhât, a connu des résultats concrets.

Les essais à l’aéroport de Nôi Bài ont montré que le taux de ponctualité des vols (On-Time Performance - OTP) a atteint 94%, tandis que le temps de roulage en attente sur la piste a été considérablement réduit, ce qui a permis d’atténuer les embouteillages, d’économiser de carburants et de réduire directement les émissions de CO₂.

Sur la base des normes et analyses internationales en matière d’aviation, on peut estimer que la combinaison des efforts de modernisation de la flotte et d’optimisation de la gestion du trafic aérien au cours de la dernière décennie a permis à l’aviation vietnamienne de réduire d’environ 30% ses émissions de CO₂ par unité de transport.

En d’autres termes, pour transporter un passager sur une distance d’un kilomètre, la quantité de CO₂ émise a diminué d’environ 30% par rapport au scénario où les technologies des années 2000 auraient été maintenues.

Ce chiffre représente non seulement une performance environnementale remarquable, mais surtout, il illustre la capacité du secteur aérien vietnamien à bâtir une base technologique solide et une maîtrise opérationnelle durable. C’est cet acquis qui constitue un socle stratégique et un avantage compétitif essentiel, permettant au Vietnam d’aborder avec confiance la prochaine étape de la transition verte - une étape pleine de défis, mais aussi riche en opportunités.

Un nouvel horizon : le CORSIA et la révolution du carburant d’aviation durable

Si la première phase de la transition verte était principalement motivée par les impératifs de sûreté, de sécurité aérienne et de rentabilité économique interne, la phase actuelle marque un tournant fondamental : on passe d’une ""transition volontaire"" à une ""transition dictée par les normes internationales"".

L’attention du public et la pression réglementaire ne se sont véritablement intensifiées qu’avec l’émergence de deux concepts clés : le CORSIA et le SAF.

Photo : CTV/CVN

Ils constituent la partie émergée de l’iceberg, là où les engagements nationaux doivent désormais se traduire en actions concrètes et coûteuses.

Le secteur aéronautique du Vietnam et les initiatives de décarbonation

L’internalisation proactive des réglementations du Vietnam et sa participation précoce à ces mécanismes ne constituent pas une action passive, mais une démarche stratégique, démontrant une vision visant à transformer des pressions en une opportunité de restructurer l’industrie aéronautique, d’améliorer la compétitivité et d’attirer les flux financiers verts mondiaux.

Alors que le CORSIA est un mécanisme fondé sur le marché, établi par l’OACI pour aider l’industrie aéronautique mondiale à atteindre la neutralité carbone d’ici 2050, le carburant d’aviation durable (SAF) est considéré comme une ""clé d’or"" et l’outil le plus efficace pour réduire les émissions de CO₂ à long terme.

Le SAF peut être produit à partir de diverses sources renouvelables, telles que les huiles de cuisson usagées, les déchets agricoles ou encore les algues, et il a le potentiel de réduire de 60% à 80% ou 94% les émissions de gaz à effet de serre sur l’ensemble de son cycle de vie, par rapport au kérosène traditionnel (Jet A1) utilisé pour les avions.

Consciente de cette importance et de cette nécessité, l’aviation vietnamienne a pris des mesures très proactives, notamment en s’inscrivant officiellement et en obtenant la confirmation de l’OACI pour participer à la phase volontaire du CORSIA à compter du 1er janvier 2026.

Il s’agit d’une décision stratégique qui démontre à la fois son rôle de membre responsable et donne au Vietnam le temps de se préparer, de renforcer ses capacités et de bénéficier du soutien technique international avant d’entrer dans la phase de participation obligatoire à partir de 2027.

Vietnam Airlines a effectué son premier vol commercial utilisant du SAF, de Singapour à Hanoi, en mai 2024, et s’est engagée à respecter la réglementation relative à l’utilisation du SAF pour les vols au départ de l’Europe.

Vietjet Air a exploité des vols utilisant du carburant d’aviation durable (SAF) au départ de Hô Chi Minh-Ville à destination de Melbourne (Australie) et de Séoul (République de Corée), affirmant ainsi son engagement fort en faveur du développement durable.

La Société par actions de carburant d’aviation Petrolimex (Petrolimex Aviation) est devenue la première entité au Vietnam à importer et à ravitailler avec succès du carburant d’aviation durable (SAF), posant ainsi une base essentielle à la formation d’une chaîne d’approvisionnement en énergie verte dans le pays.

Au niveau national, l’Institut du pétrole du Vietnam (VPI) mène activement des recherches sur les sources de matières premières disponibles ainsi que sur les technologies de production de SAF adaptées aux conditions vietnamiennes, nourrissant l’espoir d’une autonomie partielle en approvisionnement à l’avenir.

Le plus grand défi : le poids financier

Le respect des réglementations internationales entraînera clairement des coûts d’exploitation considérables pour l’aviation vietnamienne. Concernant les dépenses liées à la participation au dispositif CORSIA, selon des estimations préliminaires, rien que pour l’achat de crédits carbone destinés à compenser les émissions durant la phase volontaire (2024-2026), une grande compagnie aérienne vietnamienne pourrait devoir débourser entre 13 millions et plus de 92 millions de dollars américains, en fonction des fluctuations des prix des crédits sur le marché mondial.

En ce qui concerne le SAF, rien que pour se conformer à la réglementation ReFuelEU de l’Union européenne, qui impose l’utilisation obligatoire de 2% de SAF pour les vols au départ de l’UE, les coûts en carburant des liaisons européennes de Vietnam Airlines pourraient augmenter d’environ 4,8 millions de dollars américains par an.

Ces surcoûts, qu’on le veuille ou non, devront inévitablement être partiellement répercutés sur le prix des billets, affectant ainsi la compétitivité des compagnies aériennes et les choix des passagers.

Dans un contexte où les grands marchés, comme l’Union européenne ont déjà légiféré sur des barrières techniques en matière environnementale, à l’instar de la politique ReFuelEU, la transition verte n’est désormais plus une option.

Si les compagnies aériennes vietnamiennes ne respectent pas les normes imposées, elles ne pourront plus exploiter les lignes vers l’Europe.

Les marchandises exportées du Vietnam perdront alors un canal de transport essentiel, exposant l’ensemble du secteur à un risque d’isolement face aux flux économiques mondiaux.

Il s’agit donc ici d’un choix stratégique fondé sur un sacrifice assumé : renoncer aux profits immédiats pour préserver l’existence, l’indépendance et l’autonomie de l’aviation vietnamienne dans un monde en pleine mutation.

Aucun besoin de modifier les infrastructures aéroportuaires ou les structures des avions et moteurs.

Cependant, le Vietnam est confronté à un déficit en matière de technologie de production de SAF à grande échelle et manque d’expérience dans l’exploitation de cette nouvelle chaîne d’approvisionnement.

Une dépendance totale aux importations, à des prix élevés, engendre de lourds risques en matière de sécurité énergétique et de coût.

Actuellement, le coût de production du SAF est de 2 à 6 fois supérieur à celui du kérosène classique Jet A-1, alors que l’offre mondiale ne couvre qu’environ 0,1% de la demande totale.

C’est là un obstacle majeur auquel l’aviation vietnamienne devra faire face.

Des efforts pour le développement durable

La révolution verte du secteur aérien n’est plus un ""terrain de jeu"" réservé aux nations riches disposant de multiples options.

Elle s’est transformée en une véritable ""arène"" où la survie stratégique est en jeu pour tous les acteurs de l’aviation mondiale.

Les coûts engagés aujourd’hui ne doivent pas être considérés comme de simples pertes, mais bien comme des investissements incontournables pour garantir la ""souveraineté économique"" et l’accès aux marchés internationaux à long terme.

Accepter de renoncer à des gains immédiats est aujourd’hui indispensable non seulement pour rester dans le jeu, mais surtout pour construire une industrie aéronautique vietnamienne solide et durable au bénéfice des générations futures.

L’histoire du Vietnam est jalonnée de sacrifices héroïques : ceux de nos aïeux, qui n’ont épargné ni leur vie ni leur jeunesse pour reconquérir l’indépendance, la liberté et l’unité nationale. Aujourd’hui, confrontés à de nouveaux enjeux, nous sommes engagés dans une lutte sans arme, mais déterminante : celle contre le changement climatique.

Une lutte qui exige un autre type de sacrifice - celui du bénéfice immédiat, le prix à payer pour bâtir un avenir pérenne, un Vietnam vert et prospère pour demain.

Ce défi ne concerne pas seulement le secteur aérien : c’est toute la nation qui se mobilise. Pour transformer cette épreuve en opportunité, l’aviation vietnamienne, sous l’impulsion du Parti et du gouvernement, avec le soutien du peuple et de la société, met en place sans tarder les fondements d’une économie verte.

Les efforts portent sur le déploiement de technologies propres, la recherche et le développement de carburants d’aviation durables (SAF), valorisant les ressources biomasses du pays, mais aussi sur la formation d’une main-d’œuvre verte, une génération de techniciens et d’ingénieurs prêts à maîtriser les innovations de demain.

La transition écologique n’est pas un coût à supporter, mais un investissement pour l’avenir. Animée par l’esprit d’autonomie, de résilience et une ferme volonté de progrès, l’aviation vietnamienne surmontera ce défi.

Elle s’élèvera, non seulement dans le ciel, mais sur la voie du développement durable, contribuant ainsi à affirmer la place du Vietnam comme nation visionnaire, responsable et influente sur la scène internationale.",https://image.lecourrier.vn/MediaUpload/Medium/2025/07/26/172802-ke.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 12:56:38.326621

Our plant health application should get us three weeks.","Soybeans have been racing along. We were gone most of last week for the last softball trip of the summer. When I checked soybean fields, I found many fields were at the R3 growth stage and ready for the plant health application.

So, that was pretty much my week, prepping for or making plant health applications. Before we left for last weekend’s travel, I scheduled the final group of corn applications to be Tuesday. Monday, I pre-loaded the mix for the plane.

Since sprayer wheel tracks closed in, I hired a drone to do a couple of the high-yield-potential irrigated fields. Data shows drones to a better job in soybeans anyway, so economically, at the worst, it is probably a push. In an effort to beat the heat, the drone came early Wednesday morning. If neighbors were awake, they saw a strange flying object with red and green flashing lights!

I sprayed with the ground rig other times throughout the week. I’ve got a couple more fields to go next week.

I am concerned that some of the soybeans are getting too tall and are prone to lodging. It’s never good when they start to go down. Sunlight to lower branches is reduced and they don’t yield as well. We’re a long way from filling those pods. Nice, gentle rains for the next month would be appreciated!

Guarding against tar spot

We’re hoping we can get by with only one fungicide application on the corn. Nobody wants to spend any extra money on this crop with depressed commodity prices. However, tar spot can take down yields quickly, and you can’t afford to lose yield, either. Our plant health application should get us three weeks. We will begin checking fields in another week or 10 days to decide whether we need to make a second application.

We caught some rain last Saturday and Sunday, then again early this morning. Amounts varied, but we will call them an inch each time. We’re in a pretty OK moisture position right now, but not more than a week from more crop stress. I’ve seen conflicting weather forecasts for August, so we will wait and see.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt070c2e5dc3677f10/68839cfeaf946d12c87116f7/Stackhouse_072525.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-07-26 11:56:12.682254

He said he’s spoken with the patrollers about the dangers of the water and rogue waves.","Last week while on a day trip, I listened to this documentary on the CBC program Storylines. It’s about the dangers of rogue waves and includes interviews with a couple of Canadians who were hit by rogue waves while swimming in the ocean during their vacations in Mexico.

Here’s the show’s description of a rogue wave: “A rogue wave is defined as being at least 2.2 times as high as the average waves which have come before. They are described as coming out of nowhere and their consequences can be deadly.”

For the show, Joan Webber, a senior producer with CBC, interviewed Tassie Notar, an artist and documentary filmmaker who previously worked as a television producer with CBC.

In December 2023, Notar and two of her friends, Pam Bertrand and Mary MacNutt, also former journalists, took a trip to Chacala, Mexico. On the first day of the trip, Notar and MacNutt went for a swim at a public beach in a small bay near the resort.

When the pair was swimming, they noticed a wave about four metres tall heading their way. They started swimming for shore, but they get caught in the wave. Notar somersaulted through the wave and landed on her feet. When she found MacNutt, a paramedic from Toronto was already performing CPR, after the wave threw MacNutt up onto the beach.

MacNutt regained consciousness but her prognosis was poor. She was airlifted to Toronto but was having trouble breathing on her own. She asked to be removed from oxygen and other life-sustaining supports.

MacNutt’s obituary is here and it tells the story of a vibrant woman filled with a sense of adventure, fun, compassion, courage, and intelligence. The obituary also mentions the “mammoth rogue wave.”

She adored swimming in the ocean and exclaimed to Tassie: ‘this is glorious’ just moments before disaster struck. Weeks later in the hospital, when Mary knew that her end was near, she admitted: ‘The wave won.’

Notar told Webber in the documentary that she didn’t know about the risk of rogue waves prior to that trip.

“I told many people about what happened to Mary. I haven’t encountered anybody who knows anything about rogue waves,” Notar said.

Just a few days before I listened to that documentary, I was on a boat heading back from Pearl Island, a protected wildlife area where puffins and other birds nest. Pearl Island is a one-hour boat ride from Peggy’s Cove, and I booked the trip with Peggy’s Cove Boat Tours.

During the return from the island, our guide Diana, whose impressive sea legs allowed her to stand on the back of the boat for most of the trip, mentioned the dangers of the waves and told us about people being swept out to sea off the slippery black rocks.

Some of the tourists on the boat had heard warnings to stay off the rocks, so at least some people are getting the message. However, it was still stressful watching the people walk on the rocks from my view on the boat on what was a calm day. Rogue waves can still happen on the calmest of days on the sea.

I took the photo above and thought about how frightening it would be to get swept in the waters and how horrifying it would be to watch it happen.

The people who work in and around Peggy’s Cove, which has a million visitors a year, know about rogue waves, which are mentioned on this tourism website here.

“Rogue waves can occur. Sudden high waves can happen even on calm and sunny days. All visitors must be mindful of the dangers of the waters of Peggy’s Cove,” the website warns.

The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has this page about rogue waves, which have long been the stuff of folklore and legend of life on the sea. From the website:

Rogues, called ‘extreme storm waves’ by scientists, are those waves which are greater than twice the size of surrounding waves, are very unpredictable, and often come unexpectedly from directions other than prevailing wind and waves.

Most reports of extreme storm waves say they look like “walls of water.” They are often steep-sided with unusually deep troughs.

Oceanographic Magazine has this article on rogue waves, including details of the largest rogue wave ever recorded. That wave, which was 58 feet tall, was recorded by MarineLabs Data Systems in the North Pacific Ocean off British Columbia in November 2020.

Paul D’Eon also knows about rogue waves and the dangers of the sea. On Tuesday, I met with D’Eon, who is the special projects director with the Lifesaving Society Nova Scotia. He’s spent the last 50 years teaching water safety, first as a lifeguard and then through various roles with the society.

“People are unaware of the power of the waves,” D’Eon said.

We hear the news stories when people are swept out from Peggy’s Cove. Zarin and Harshil Barot were visiting Peggy’s Cove in April 2022 when Harshil slipped into the water. Zarin went in to help, but Harshil drowned. Zarin was rescued and ended up in intensive care.

In April 2015, Jamie Quattrochi and his girlfriend were swept off the rocks by a rogue wave. Quattrochi drowned and his girlfriend made it out of the water.

The Quattrochi and Barot families have both spoken about the importance of preventing more deaths at the site. D’Eon has worked with Quattrochi’s mother, Caroline, on raising awareness about the dangers at Peggy’s Cove.

“We know Peggy’s Cove is where the most people drown in Nova Scotia over the last 40, 50 years,” D’Eon said.

D’Eon said fortunately no one has been swept into the waters off Peggy’s Cove in the last few months. He said that as he knocked on the top of his wooden desk. He said once someone is swept into or falls into the waters, it’s unlikely they’ll get out.

“You’re going to be a statistic. It’s very difficult to escape. You’ve got pounding waves hitting you, slippery rocks that are steep, that you can’t climb up,” D’Eon said. “You can see the shipwrecks off Sable Island. That’ll tell you the story of how powerful the North Atlantic [ocean] is. It’s not to be fooled with.”

D’Eon said that combination of factors at Peggy’s Cove strikes fear even into the best swimmers. He said he’s taken top lifeguards from around the world to Peggy’s Cove. He told me one lifeguard from Australia watched the conditions at Peggy’s Cove and said going in would be certain death.

D’Eon said the beaches of Hawaii and Australia have dangers similar to Peggy’s Cove. He said in Hawaii, there are lifeguards on jet skis who patrol just off the shore of the island’s beaches.

“That climate [at Peggy’s Cove] is not conducive to sitting a guy out there on a jet ski waiting for someone to fall in the water,” D’Eon said.

He said the goal of the Lifesaving Society Nova Scotia is to focus on prevention and stopping people from being swept in or falling into the water in the first place.

These days, there are security guards with whistles who warn people to stay away from the black rocks, or to move back when they are too close to the water. These rock patrollers, as they are called, aren’t lifeguards; they work for a private security company. They have first aid and intervention training.

D’Eon was part of a committee that decided to hire the rock patrollers. He said he’s spoken with the patrollers about the dangers of the water and rogue waves. In the first year on the job (August 2022-2023), rock patrollers issued 3,600 warnings to visitors who were on the black rocks and were too close to the water.

Another form of prevention are the signs warning visitors of the dangers of the ocean and waves. They are all over the area from the time you drive onto Peggy’s Point Road to around the lighthouse perched on the rocks. D’Eon said during a visit to Peggy’s Cove in the spring, he counted 42 signs.

There’s a bronze sign attached to one of the rocks just near the accessible platform. More recent signs are painted in bright yellow with the word “danger” and other warnings on them.

Still, D’Eon said there are other ways to prevent drowning. He said he’s been to many international conferences where ideas for prevention were presented, including a remote-controlled device called Rescue Bob that could be put into the waves. How effective they’d be at Peggy’s Cove is another story.

“I was thinking, this thing is made of plastic, about four feet long. It looks nice in this calm sea, but if a wave picks that up and slams it against a Peggy’s Cove rock, you have a plastic pollution problem,” D’Eon said.

As Yvette d’Entremont wrote in April 2023, Dalhousie University students Willem Glozanski, Zach Gould, Liam Carson, and Tanner Duplessis created a projectile device that launches a life jacket to people in the water until help can arrive.

D’Eon said other suggestions have included a loudspeaker with a message that warns visitors at the site on stormy days or on days when the waves are larger. But how many interventions are too many?

“There’s a mix to wanting it to be a peaceful, pleasant experience. I mean, we could fence it so people can’t get down [to the water], but photographers and artists and the people who want to see the natural environment don’t like that,” D’Eon said.

“A healthy respect for the distance that you stand back, sometimes that won’t even work.”

D’Eon said climate change will play a big role in water safety as storms get worse, winds get stronger, and waves on the ocean get higher. During our interview, he told me about Heather Beach outside of Amherst, the first beach he worked as a young lifeguard. It has lost 90 feet of frontage in the last five decades.

He also mentioned how in the fall of 2023, post-tropical storm Lee flooded the tunnel at Rissers Beach in Petite Rivière.

“In my lifetime, I never would have thought that was possible,” D’Eon said.

And he recalled the story of a lifeguard who was stuck in his car under eight feet of flood waters after a rogue wave washed over Lawrencetown Road. That lifeguard managed to get out of his car and to dry land.

Just as D’Eon was telling me this story, that former lifeguard, Scott Keeling, called D’Eon on his phone.

“[The water] was over my head, so I started swimming up to the teahouse [The Macdonald House] until I could touch ground again,” Keeling said over the speaker on D’Eon’s phone.

I wonder if the increase in drownings is a concern of the Houston government, which ditched the Coastal Protection Act in 2024, downloading the responsibility onto municipalities.

D’Eon said safety should always be top of mind when you’re near or in the water. That’s whether you’re at Peggy’s Cove or at a lake. He encourages people at Peggy’s Cove to tell other visitors they are too close to the slippery rocks and water.

In the meantime, D’Eon works to get the message out and to prevent drownings, including from rogue waves, at Peggy’s Cove and elsewhere. He said the society, lifeguards, and others working to prevent drownings never really know how many lives they save.

“We might think we’ve saved some. It’s the actions they don’t do that saves lives ahead of time. We don’t want to get to the point where we have to make a rescue,” D’Eon said. “Safety first.”

VIEWS

Fact checking Fillmore

You may recall in December, in a scrum with reporters, Mayor Andy Fillmore said this line: “I believe that the worst of the housing crisis in HRM is behind us.” That line was in this story I wrote, published Dec. 3, 2024.

Fillmore said that line in response to a question I asked him about encampments. The scrum took place after council voted against Fillmore’s motion to rescind the list of nine sites for potential tent encampments.

Specifically, my question was about Fillmore’s response to an independent review of the August 2021 evictions from shelters in the city.

In response to my question, Fillmore said this: “A report from Ontario about people living rough in Halifax, I strongly disagree with the findings of that report,” and that the situation in Halifax then in 2024 was “radically different” than in 2021.

Then he went on:

Let’s stay in the present. We have vacancies across the shelter system, and more and more options coming online that are supported and indoors, from the province.

I believe that the worst of the housing crisis in HRM is behind us, and it’s only going to get better. That’s the belief that I have and the work that I am doing to support that belief.

You should know that at scrums with Fillmore, reporters get one question, one follow-up question. To say we were all stunned at that response would be an understatement.

Consider this. In October 2024, Max Chauvin, Halifax Regional Municipality’s director of housing and homelessness, gave a presentation to the accessibility advisory committee. Chauvin said the number of people living outdoors is growing by 4% a month.

Also consider this article by Yvette d’Entremont in May of this year that looked at the “Everyone Counts in HRM Point-in-Time Count Report.” It was conducted in November 2024, so a month before Fillmore made his statement about the housing crisis.

That report is done by the Affordable Housing Association of Nova Scotia (AHANS), whose executive director, Michael Kabalen, said the number of people counted in the report was a minimum of 1,132 people, double the since the last count in 2022.

From d’Entremont’s story:

“First and foremost, 1,132 people is more than the population of Mahone Bay. Imagine Mahone Bay had no housing. That’s what we’re talking about,” AHANS executive director Michael Kabalen said in an interview.

“The 1,132 people that we’re talking about today are real people. These are people who have nowhere that they call home. Let’s think about that for a second.”

I remember thinking after that scrum in December that I would start a segment called Fact Checking Fillmore, in which I would correct or clarify, with help from experts and readers, some of what Fillmore says in scrums, council meetings, and media interviews.

So today, I am starting Fact Checking Fillmore, inspired by this interview Fillmore did on CBC radio’s Maritime Noon with Bob Murphy on Tuesday. The interview focused on strong mayor powers, and included Cape Breton University political scientist Tom Urbaniak as a guest as well. I interviewed Urbaniak in June about strong mayor legislation, which Urbaniak described as “Sort of like a mini-American presidency.”

Murphy asked Fillmore about his thoughts on strong mayor powers, and Fillmore said after nine months on the job he’s learned “the governance system, this older governance system, is creaking under the weight of 21st-century complexities and challenges” and that he can’t deliver his mandate.

Then he said this: “The model we have right now, the model I’ve described as being from simpler, quieter times. In fact, it’s the unelected chief administrative officer (CAO) who holds the power, and is not accountable to the electorate at all….the CAO holds the power and in our organizational chart, I report to the CAO.”

Now, here’s what it says in the Halifax Regional Municipality Charter:

34 (3) The Council shall provide direction on the administration, plans, policies and programs of the Municipality to the Chief Administrative Officer.

Council and Chief Administrative Officer relationship 34 (1) The Chief Administrative Officer is the head of the administrative branch of the government of the Municipality and is responsible to the Council for the proper administration of the affairs of the Municipality in accordance with the by-laws of the Municipality and the policies adopted by the Council.

HRM’s CAO doesn’t hold the power, as Fillmore said. The CAO reports to Halifax regional council, which includes the mayor.

Furthermore, the mayor chairs council’s executive standing committee. That’s the committee that, among other roles, provides liaison and review of the CAO. You can read more here.

This morning, Haley Ryan at CBC did her fact checking, too, and spoke with several councillors about Fillmore’s comments on Maritime Noon.

I sometimes hear that Halifax regional council is “divided” on the issue of strong mayor powers, but I don’t think that’s the case at all, and certainly not what I’ve seen and heard in council chambers.

Here’s what some councillors told Ryan about what Fillmore said on Maritime Noon:

Coun. Patty Cuttell: “I think it’s always unfortunate when people spread misinformation, particularly someone who’s supposed to be a trusted public figure.”

Coun. Janet Steele: “I think it’s really unfortunate that we’re having all this drama over this issue. And I feel like we’ve been hijacked a bit by the mayor and by the premier weighing in.”

Coun. Kathryn Morse: “Either the mayor is not understanding his job, or he’s deliberately misleading people, and either one is terrible.”

Here’s what CAO Cathie O’Toole said: “The mayor is part of regional council. The CAO reports to mayor and council, per the employment contract. The mayor does not report to the CAO. The CAO does not ‘hold the power’ — mayor and council do.”

Ryan’s story is here and also includes the organizational chart Fillmore mentions, which clearly shows the CAO reports to Halifax regional council, which includes the mayor. At the very top of the chart are the residents of Halifax Regional Municipality.

Oh, the Municipal Government Act also has a code of conduct that you can find here. Here’s a line under the section titled General Conduct:

6 (1) A council member must be truthful and forthright and not deceive or knowingly mislead Council, the CAO, staff or the public.

In another scrum earlier this month, Fillmore said he “didn’t fully understand the barriers” to the job of being mayor until he became the mayor.

It’s tough for anyone being in a new job for the first time. There’s lots to learn, but in Fillmore’s case it seems he’s unwilling or uninterested in learning the job as it is, and instead wants to rework the role as he — or Premier Tim Houston — sees fit.

In this post on his Facebook page on July 18, Fillmore is looking to hire four staff members, including a council relations and community liaison role. From the job description:

The Council Relations & Community Liaison serves as a critical connector between the Mayor’s Office, members of Regional Council, and communities across the municipality. This role helps ensure consistent, proactive communication, manages constituent inquiries, and facilitates meaningful engagement between the Mayor and the people of Halifax. It requires a relational mindset, an understanding of municipal governance, and the ability to navigate sensitive or complex dynamics with tact and integrity.

Fillmore certainly needs it.

RECENTLY IN THE HALIFAX EXAMINER:

1. ‘Safe and lovely streets’: Bike lanes and bikelash

Philip Moscovitch has this interview with Patrick Morgan, spokesperson for the Cycling Action Network in New Zealand. Why New Zealand, you wonder? Moscovitch told me that after his Morning File about car brain was posted on Mastodon, many of the comments were from people in New Zealand who ride bikes and advocate for proper and safe biking infrastructure.

Honestly, if you didn’t know this Q&A was about New Zealand, you could easily think it’s about the bikelash in Halifax.

Moscovitch and Morgan talk about the efforts to build biking infrastructure across New Zealand. I won’t share all of the interview except a couple of segments, including this one:

HE: Here in Halifax, we had almost no protected bike infrastructure, and now that the city is building this bike infrastructure, and it’s actually almost at the point of being useful because you have the different segments connecting to each other, we’re seeing bikelash: Rip out the bike lanes, they’re causing too much traffic congestion, they’re too expensive. Why are we wasting money on these things? Everyone’s driving anyway.

Are you seeing a similar pattern?

PM: This pattern is very familiar in New Zealand. Making change can be hard, and cities need to explain really carefully what they’re doing, why, how it will affect people, and what the benefits will be.

Just as your cycling network is getting built, that’s the point of maximum pain. It’s when a lot of the money costs and the construction disruption are really apparent, but maybe you’ve yet to see the full benefits of a connected network. So now is a critical time for politicians to show some backbone, and show their commitment to safe and lovely streets. It’s also critical for bike advocates to keep telling the story about the benefits of offering people more transport choices: happier people, lower health bills, lower fuel bills, less congestion, and more choice.

And then this question and answer:

HE: Is the opposition from governments really about bike lanes, or is it more of a culture-war type of argument?

PM: This is a political playbook that’s well known, which is misdirect. Politicians will always do this. It might be bike lanes now, it could be something else. This kind of politician often wants to blame someone else for the problem instead of looking at the core reasons. If they’re attacking migrants, or people of colour, or transgender communities, or people who ride bikes — they try these different strategies, and see which ones take root. And attacking cycling seems to be effective in some places. That’s why it’s really important to push back against it and make the case for safe and lovely streets. We need to push back and focus on our core values as a community. Safe streets is a really basic value that most people share, and protecting people’s lives in our streets is a strongly held value.

We’re seeing this all play out now in Halifax, of course.

The interview ends with a question from Morgan, who asked this: “Tell me Philip, Is it legal to smoke in bars in Halifax?”

HE: No, it’s not. Strictly speaking, it’s not legal to smoke almost anywhere.

PM: Forty years ago in New Zealand, when we were talking about smoke-free bars, people said the sky would fall, that businesses would close. It would be a terrible thing that can’t happen. Now that we’ve had smoke-free bars for a couple of decades, it’s just not an issue. It’s totally normalized. All the heat has gone out of the discussion. I think bike lanes is like that. We’re going through the point now where they’re being introduced at scale, and people are seeing that it’s happening. But in a decade or so, people will just accept that it is normalized, and they’ll wonder why it was ever different from this.

This is a good summary of how change is hard but also how once the change is made, it benefits everyone and people forget what life was like before the change.

I was working in bars and restaurants when smoking was banned in those establishments across Nova Scotia. A lot of people were concerned about the negative impact on businesses. But that impact didn’t happen.

In fact, for guests and staff, being in no-smoking environments made things much better and safer. I didn’t have to clean ashtrays, my clothes weren’t getting burned by cigarettes, and I wasn’t breathing in second-hand smoke for hours on end. Neither were non-smoking customers.

Twenty years later, it’s so normal to not smoke in bars we can’t imagine it being any other way.

2. Rink fries, chips, and Coke: food marketing in Canadian rec centres

Moscovitch was on a writing roll on Thursday, with this second story after he wrote Morning File.

In this piece, Moscovitch writes about food marketing in recreation centres in Canada. It’s a problem that the food being marketed in rec centres is not terribly healthy. Moscovitch spoke with Sara Kirk, a professor of health promotion at Dalhousie University.

She’s also one of the authors of a paper on food marketing in recreation centres across the country. For the paper, researchers looked at the amount and type of food marketing at 85 recreation and sport facilities (RSF) across Canada. They also looked for correlations between the amount of marketing and whether or not an RSF had food marketing policies, sponsorship agreements, or contracts.

Moscovitch writes:

“We were really interested in the food marketing frequency, and to see whether or not that frequency was in any way associated with whether they had a food sponsorship policy, agreement, or contract,” Kirk said in an interview.

Policy can be internal, or could come from government, or a non-governmental organization. Sponsorships cover everything from Timbits sports, where a fast food giant sponsors teams, to banners in arenas. Contracts are defined in the paper as “legal agreements speciﬁcally between food and beverage suppliers and the RSF to exclusively promote and/or use their products.”

Kirk said the study found that in facilities that had food sponsorship contracts, “Surprise surprise, there was more food sponsorship visible. And that’s kind of like ‘so what. that’s what you would expect.’ But I think the point of this is that unhealthy foods are ubiquitous, and they’re heavily marketed.”

What the researchers found was that food sponsorship was most often connected to junk food. Coke and Pepsi were tops in terms of the number of mentions in RSFs with sponsorship agreements.

Kirk mentions the pressure parents face too because a lot of junk food and fast food is less expensive than making something healthy at home. And rec centres have their own pressures regarding funding, so sponsorships bring in money.

3. The search for sustainable jet fuel: Nova Scotia joins the hunt

On Wednesday, Jennifer Henderson headed to Goldboro on Nova Scotia’s Eastern Shore for a meeting about “the next big thing” in the community that used to be home to gold mines and then a processing plant for natural gas for the Sable Offshore Energy Project.

Henderson writes:

A company called Nova Sustainable Fuels uses maps, charts, and videos to explain what is a complicated engineering process to produce sustainable fuel for jet airplanes, a feedstock that could also be adapted for ships.

There is no project for Goldboro and Nova Scotia yet. Literally a dozen moving pieces — including front-end engineering, environmental assessments, and consultation with the Mi’kmaq and local community — need to align first. But there is a golden marketing opportunity.

Air travel generates tonnes of carbon emissions and is a major contributor to the pace of climate change. The European Union has mandated that 2% of aviation fuel must be low-carbon by 2025, with the percentage of green fuel rising to meet a 70% renewable threshold by 2050.

That’s the brass ring Goldboro and Nova Sustainable Fuels are hoping to grasp. Andrew Parsons (born in Cape Breton and a Nova Scotia university graduate in economics and finance) is the project director. All Parsons will say about the estimated cost to develop 165,000 tonnes a year of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is that the price tag will be “in the multiple billions of dollars.”

Henderson interviewed local residents who spoke with cautious optimism about the project. Nova Scotia’s Eastern Shore has long experienced boom-and-bust cycles.

“Folks in Goldboro have learned all that glitters is not always gold,” Henderson wrote.

She also spoke with Parsons about the project. He said a decision to go ahead on the project will be made by the end of 2027.

Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, the UAE’s Smart Cities initiative, and Qatar’s push toward tourism diversification are driving investments that will ultimately enhance every aspect of the travel experience.

1. AI-Powered Travel Services: Personalizing Every Step of the Journey

Artificial intelligence (AI) has already become an integral part of the travel sector worldwide, and the Middle East is no exception. By 2025, AI-driven solutions will play an even larger role in reshaping the way travelers plan, book, and experience their trips. In the UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, several companies are integrating AI-powered tools into travel booking platforms, customer service, and real-time assistance.

One of the most notable developments in AI travel technology is the use of personalized travel recommendations. Companies like Wego (a travel metasearch engine) and Viavii (an experiential travel platform) are leveraging AI and machine learning to offer travelers tailored itineraries based on their preferences, travel history, and current trends. This level of personalization provides a much more refined travel experience, helping travelers to discover new destinations, find hidden gems, and make more informed decisions about their trips.

Airlines are also incorporating AI technology to enhance the passenger experience. For instance, Emirates Airlines has rolled out an AI-based chatbot to assist customers with bookings, check-in, and flight status updates. This is particularly useful during peak travel periods, reducing wait times and improving operational efficiency.

Furthermore, AI-driven systems are now being used for real-time updates on flight status, baggage handling, and even predicting delays or changes to itineraries. As AI becomes more integrated into the region’s travel infrastructure, travelers will benefit from smoother, more personalized journeys, allowing them to focus on enjoying their trips rather than navigating the complexities of travel logistics.

2. Smart Airports: Enhancing Efficiency and Passenger Comfort

The concept of smart airports is quickly gaining traction across the Middle East, and by 2025, most major airports in the region will incorporate digital solutions to create a seamless, efficient experience for passengers. In the UAE, the Dubai International Airport (DXB) has long been a pioneer in the use of technology to streamline the passenger journey. DXB is working to enhance its use of biometric facial recognition technology, AI-powered security systems, and real-time baggage tracking.

One of the key developments expected by 2025 is the widespread implementation of biometric systems that allow travelers to use their facial features or fingerprints to check in, pass through security, and board flights. This eliminates the need for boarding passes and reduces waiting times, making airports more efficient and accessible. Abu Dhabi International Airport is also implementing similar technologies to enhance passenger convenience and speed up the check-in process.

Additionally, airports in Saudi Arabia, including King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, are investing in digital solutions to improve passenger flow. From self-check-in kiosks to automated baggage drop-off points, these innovations are designed to reduce congestion and create a frictionless airport experience for travelers. AI-powered systems are also being used to predict potential bottlenecks at security checkpoints, allowing staff to redirect passengers to less busy areas.

Moreover, smart airports are incorporating digital signage and interactive kiosks to provide passengers with real-time information on flight status, gate changes, and other relevant updates. These systems ensure that travelers are well-informed at every stage of their journey, further enhancing convenience and customer satisfaction.

3. Autonomous Vehicles: Revolutionizing Transportation Networks

One of the most exciting developments in Middle Eastern travel technology is the rise of autonomous vehicles. The UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar are leading the way in integrating self-driving cars and buses into their transportation networks, aiming to improve efficiency, reduce congestion, and provide passengers with a new level of convenience.

In Dubai, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has partnered with WeRide, a Chinese autonomous vehicle company, to introduce robotaxi services in the city. The autonomous taxis are expected to provide a safer and more convenient mode of transport, particularly during peak hours when traffic congestion is a significant issue. The service, which is set to launch in 2025, will provide a seamless travel experience for visitors and residents alike, with passengers able to book rides using their smartphones.

Similarly, Pony.ai, another autonomous vehicle company, has also expanded its operations to the Middle East, with trials set to begin in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh. These vehicles will offer on-demand transport, allowing passengers to travel to their destinations without the need for human drivers. By 2025, autonomous vehicles are expected to play a central role in reshaping urban mobility in the region.

In addition to autonomous taxis, Saudi Arabia is investing in flying taxis or urban air mobility (UAM) solutions, with the goal of launching air taxis by 2026. These vehicles, powered by electric propulsion systems, will offer passengers a fast and environmentally friendly way to navigate congested urban areas.

4. Blockchain Technology for Secure Travel Transactions

Blockchain technology is making its mark on the Middle East travel industry in 2025. As one of the most secure and transparent technologies available, blockchain offers a solution to many of the challenges faced by travelers, including fraud prevention, secure payments, and identity verification.

Blockchain technology is being utilized to streamline the booking process, with travel platforms leveraging its secure ledger system to ensure that transactions are processed safely and efficiently. Saudi Arabia’s PIF-backed travel initiatives, including those related to digital visas, are utilizing blockchain to provide secure, tamper-proof systems for booking accommodations, flights, and car rentals.

Furthermore, blockchain can enhance travel security by allowing travelers to store their personal information in digital wallets. This eliminates the need for physical passports or paper records and allows travelers to prove their identity securely through blockchain-based certificates.

As blockchain technology becomes more widely adopted, it is expected to significantly reduce the risks of fraud and streamline payment systems, further enhancing the security and efficiency of travel transactions.

5. Sustainable Travel Technologies: Reducing Environmental Impact

Sustainability is at the forefront of travel technology developments in the Middle East. With growing concerns about climate change and environmental degradation, the region is increasingly focused on sustainable tourism solutions that minimize the carbon footprint of the travel industry.

By 2025, electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to become a common mode of transportation for tourists and residents alike. Countries like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar are implementing EV infrastructure to ensure that tourists can travel sustainably throughout their visits. The development of charging stations for electric cars in cities and key tourist attractions will encourage travelers to opt for greener transportation options.

The Middle East is also focusing on sustainable aviation, with several airlines, including Emirates Airlines, exploring the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to reduce emissions. Additionally, airports in the region are implementing eco-friendly practices, such as energy-efficient terminals, solar power systems, and waste-reduction initiatives, to promote sustainability across the travel sector.

6. Digital Health Passports and Smart Services for Pilgrims

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital health passports have become a critical component of travel in the Middle East. These digital health certificates allow travelers to store and share their vaccination records, test results, and other health-related documents in a secure, easily accessible format. Saudi Arabia, in particular, has implemented digital health passports for pilgrims traveling to Makkah and Madinah for Hajj and Umrah.

The use of digital health passports ensures that pilgrims and tourists comply with health and safety protocols, making travel safer and more efficient. In addition, smart services such as virtual reality (VR) tours of religious sites and AI-powered pilgrim assistance systems are improving the overall pilgrimage experience.

7. The Rise of Digital Travel Agencies and Booking Platforms

The traditional travel agency model is evolving in the Middle East, with digital platforms offering travelers personalized, AI-powered services. Companies like Wego and Viavii are providing travelers with customized itineraries, real-time booking options, and seamless payment solutions. These platforms use machine learning algorithms to understand individual preferences and suggest personalized travel experiences based on historical data and user input.

The shift toward digital booking platforms is expected to continue, as more travelers prefer the convenience of managing their trips through mobile apps and online services. These platforms also provide access to comprehensive information about destinations, accommodations, and activities, helping travelers make informed decisions.

8. Tourism Data and Analytics

Tourism data and analytics are becoming increasingly important for both travelers and service providers in the Middle East. Governments and tourism boards are using data analytics to predict tourist trends, identify emerging markets, and optimize travel infrastructure. By leveraging big data, the region is improving its ability to forecast tourism demand, enhance service delivery, and reduce overcrowding at popular tourist destinations.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/freepik__the-style-is-candid-image-photography-with-natural__55663-1.jpeg,N,,2025-07-26 14:56:47.577219

The global sustainable finance market has reached an inflection point. With the United Nations estimating that $4 trillion annually is required to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investing has moved from the periphery to the centre of financial decision-making. Yet fundamental challenges threaten to undermine its credibility and effectiveness.

The evolution from socially responsible investing in the 1990s through Corporate Social Responsibility in the 2000s to today’s ESG framework reflects a growing recognition that non-financial factors materially affect long-term returns. However, this progression has exposed critical structural weaknesses in how we measure and verify sustainability claims.

The most pressing issue facing sustainable finance is the absence of standardised ESG metrics. Different rating agencies routinely assign contradictory scores to the same company, creating confusion for investors and opportunities for manipulation. While quantifiable factors like carbon emissions can be measured with reasonable accuracy, subjective elements such as governance quality remain poorly defined. This inconsistency enables “rating shopping”, where companies selectively engage with agencies likely to provide favourable assessments.

The reliance on self-reported data compounds these problems. Without mandatory third-party verification, companies face few barriers to exaggerating their sustainability credentials. This has given rise to various forms of misrepresentation: greenwashing (inflated environmental claims), brownwashing (concealing harmful practices), and greenhushing (deliberately understating sustainability efforts to avoid litigation). Each undermines market integrity and investor confidence.

As an example of the perverse incentives created by ESG frameworks, consider Malaysia’s used cooking oil (UCO) market. European regulations favour sustainable aviation fuel made from waste products like UCO over virgin palm oil, creating a premium for supposedly “used” oil. The result: fresh cooking oil in Malaysia sells for approximately $0.60 per kilogram while UCO commands $1.00. This price differential has spawned an entire fraudulent ecosystem where fresh oil is passed off as used, defeating the environmental purpose while enriching intermediaries. Criminal syndicates have emerged to exploit this arbitrage, mixing subsidised fresh oil with UCO shipments. The environmental impact is precisely opposite to what regulators intended — instead of reducing waste, the system creates additional demand for palm oil production and associated deforestation.

This cooking oil fraud exemplifies a broader pattern in sustainable finance: well-intentioned regulations creating unintended consequences. When the market values the appearance of sustainability more than actual environmental impact, rational actors will supply that appearance. The UCO case demonstrates how ESG metrics, divorced from rigorous verification, become vehicles for fraud rather than instruments of change.

Current regulatory frameworks remain inadequate to address such systemic failures. The UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment, while well-intentioned, lack enforcement mechanisms. Signatories can claim adherence without meaningful implementation, reducing these principles to symbolic gestures. The European Union’s binding regulations offer a more promising model, yet as the UCO example shows, even mandatory frameworks can be subverted without proper verification systems.

Recent empirical evidence raises additional troubling questions about ESG implementation. Research on board diversity reveals that companies with female directors experience greater IPO underpricing — approximately $13 million more left unclaimed. This suggests that markets may value the appearance of ESG compliance over substantive impact, indicating that much ESG adoption remains performative rather than transformative.

The tension between fiduciary duty and sustainability goals has become increasingly apparent. BlackRock’s legal challenges exemplify this conflict, with the asset manager facing lawsuits from both ESG advocates and critics. This highlights the fundamental question: can investment strategies prioritise sustainability while maintaining competitive returns? The financial sector’s response to this question will shape the future of sustainable investing.

These challenges occur against a backdrop of declining public trust in financial institutions. Survey data indicates that confidence in finance professionals has deteriorated more rapidly than in other sectors since the mid-1990s. This erosion of trust creates additional obstacles for ESG adoption, as sceptical stakeholders question whether financial institutions can credibly champion sustainability.

Proposed technological solutions present their own paradoxes. Blockchain technology could enhance transparency in ESG reporting, but its significant energy consumption contradicts environmental objectives. Such contradictions illustrate the complexity of implementing sustainable finance solutions.

For Malaysian financial markets, these global trends carry important implications. The UCO fraud case demonstrates how local markets can be distorted by international ESG requirements. As international investors increasingly integrate ESG factors into allocation decisions, local companies and financial institutions must navigate between genuine sustainability commitments and performative compliance. The choice of regulatory approach — voluntary guidelines versus mandatory standards with robust verification — will significantly influence market development.

The path forward requires addressing fundamental weaknesses in the ESG ecosystem. Standardised metrics must replace the current patchwork of rating methodologies. Independent verification should become mandatory, not optional. Regulatory frameworks need enforcement mechanisms that ensure accountability. Companies must move beyond symbolic gestures to substantive changes in business practices.

Financial institutions face a credibility test. After decades of prioritising short-term profits, they must demonstrate that their commitment to sustainability extends beyond marketing rhetoric. This requires acknowledging trade-offs between immediate returns and long-term sustainability, rather than perpetuating the fiction that all ESG investments automatically enhance profits.

The sustainable finance sector stands at a critical juncture. The gap between its promise and current practice threatens to undermine legitimate efforts to align financial markets with environmental and social objectives. As the Malaysian UCO case illustrates, without rigorous verification and enforcement, ESG frameworks can create perverse incentives that worsen the very problems they aim to solve. Closing this gap demands rigorous standards, authentic leadership, and regulatory frameworks that distinguish genuine sustainability from performative compliance.

The $4 trillion question is not whether sustainable finance can work, but whether market participants will implement the reforms necessary to make it work. For emerging markets like Malaysia, the decisions made today will determine whether sustainable finance becomes a driver of meaningful change or another chapter in the long history of financial sector disappointments.

The company's strategic balance between conventional fuels and renewable initiatives reveals a complex interplay of operational resilience, profitability, and long-term vision. For investors, understanding this balance is critical to assessing whether Phillips 66 can sustain its position as a leading integrated downstream energy provider amid shifting global demand.

Conventional Fuels: Cost Discipline and Operational Excellence

Phillips 66's conventional fuels segment continues to anchor its financial stability. In Q3 2025, the company reported a $2.04 per share adjusted earnings from its refining operations, driven by a $8.31 per barrel realized margin and a 94% crude utilization rate. These figures, while slightly lower than Q2 2025, reflect disciplined cost management. The company's $1.4 billion run-rate savings target, achieved ahead of schedule, includes a $1 per barrel reduction in refining costs, underscoring its operational efficiency.

The Refining segment's 87% clean product yield—a 1% increase from the prior quarter—highlights progress in producing cleaner fuels, aligning with regulatory trends while maintaining profitability. Phillips 66's asset disposition strategy further bolsters its conventional fuels focus: $2.7 billion in non-core asset sales, including its Swiss retail joint venture and Midstream assets in North Dakota, have freed capital for high-return projects.

Renewable Fuels: Growth Amid Marginal Pressures

The Renewable Fuels segment, while still unprofitable, shows signs of strategic progress. In Q3 2025, the segment reported a pre-tax loss of $116 million, a narrowing from the $185 million loss in Q1 2025. This improvement stems from higher production volumes—44 million barrels per day (MBD) in Q3 2025, up from 31 MBD in Q2 2024—and realized margin improvements driven by inventory gains and tax credit adjustments.

Key projects like the Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex (RREC) are central to Phillips 66's renewable strategy. The RREC, which produces 800 million gallons annually of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), is supported by a 30.2-megawatt solar facility. This project not only reduces CO₂ emissions by 33,000 metric tons annually but also positions the company to meet growing demand for low-carbon fuels. Strategic partnerships, such as supplying SAF to United Airlines, further validate the scalability of renewable fuels.

However, the segment's profitability remains constrained. Lower realized margins, driven by volatile feedstock prices and regulatory uncertainties, continue to weigh on results. Phillips 66's proposal to convert refineries in New Jersey, Texas, and Louisiana to renewable fuels—pending approval by the U.S. Foreign-Trade Zone (FTZ) Board—could unlock cost advantages via customs duty exemptions, but execution risks persist.

Strategic Synergies: Midstream and Chemicals as Growth Levers

Phillips 66's Midstream and Chemicals segments are critical to its long-term strategy. The acquisition of EPIC's NGL business and the integration of DCP Midstream have generated $400 million in synergies, while projects like the Dos Picos II NGL fractionator aim to boost mid-cycle adjusted EBITDA by $1 billion by 2027. These investments strengthen the company's wellhead-to-market strategy, enhancing resilience by linking renewable production to robust logistics infrastructure.

The Chemicals segment, meanwhile, benefits from Phillips 66's low-cost refining platform, which supplies feedstocks at competitive prices. This vertical integration insulates the company from some of the volatility affecting standalone chemical producers, particularly as demand for petrochemicals remains resilient.

Assessing the Strategic Balance

Phillips 66's dual focus on conventional and renewable fuels reflects a calculated approach to the energy transition. On one hand, the company leverages its refining expertise to maintain profitability in a sector where it retains competitive advantages. On the other, it invests in renewable fuels to align with decarbonization mandates and capture emerging markets.

The key question for investors is whether these initiatives can coexist profitably. The Renewable Fuels segment's $133 million Q2 2025 loss—a $52 million improvement from Q1—suggests progress, but the path to breakeven remains challenging. Meanwhile, the conventional fuels business faces headwinds from refining margin compression and global demand shifts.

Investment Implications

For investors, Phillips 66 offers a compelling case study in balancing short-term profitability with long-term transformation. The company's $5.3 billion shareholder returns in 2024 and $1.1 billion return in Q4 2024 demonstrate its commitment to capital efficiency, while its $17 billion debt reduction target underscores financial discipline.

However, risks remain. The Renewable Fuels segment's reliance on government incentives and its vulnerability to feedstock price swings could delay breakeven. Additionally, refining margins are likely to remain volatile amid global economic uncertainties.

Recommendation: Investors seeking exposure to a diversified energy transition play should consider Phillips 66, but with a long-term horizon. The company's strategic balance between conventional and renewable fuels, coupled with its midstream and chemical synergies, positions it to navigate the transition while maintaining profitability. However, near-term volatility in the Renewable Fuels segment warrants caution.

In conclusion, Phillips 66's Q3 2025 results highlight a company in motion—refining its core while pivoting toward a lower-carbon future. For investors willing to tolerate short-term volatility, the rewards of this strategic balance may prove substantial.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-26 11:56:16.465211

This marks one of the first major endorsements by a consumer goods company in the UK for green hydrogen use.
This infrastructure upgrade aims to connect hydrogen producers with key consumers, such as power plants and industries, facilitating wider adoption of hydrogen energy.
Details of the 10 hydrogen projects kicking off now are below.
Hydrogen UK CEO Clare Jackson said: “Signing these contracts demonstrates the confidence and commitment of both the government and industry in building a sustainable hydrogen sector.","These projects, part of the first phase of the government’s Hydrogen Allocation Round (HAR1), aim to decarbonise heavy industry while creating skilled jobs in regions such as South Wales, Bradford, North Scotland and Teesside.

The initiatives form a crucial part of the government’s wider goal to position the UK as a clean energy leader and reduce reliance on fossil fuels in sectors like steel, glass manufacturing and heavy transport. The projects will produce hydrogen domestically through electrolysers, which use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, offering an alternative fuel source to cut industrial emissions.

One project already under construction is the HyMarnham scheme in Newark, Nottinghamshire, where the former High Marnham coal-fired power station is being converted into a green hydrogen hub serving local waste disposal operations.

Another significant development, the Cromarty Hydrogen Project in Northeast Scotland, will deploy 35MW of electrolysers to supply hydrogen to local industries, including distilleries.

Collectively, these projects are anticipated to create over 700 jobs – including apprenticeships and engineering positions – and attract more than £400M in private investment that has been committed between 2024 and 2026. The infusion of capital and expertise is expected to bolster industrial communities and foster innovation.

In a related move, Kimberly-Clark, the maker of household products such as Andrex and Kleenex, has committed £125M to HAR1 projects at its plants in Barrow-in-Furness and Northfleet, partnering with energy firms including HYRO and Carlton Power. This marks one of the first major endorsements by a consumer goods company in the UK for green hydrogen use.

The government’s hydrogen programme is supported by over £2bn in revenue funding over 15 years through the Hydrogen Production Business Model and more than £90M via the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund for capital expenditure. Work continues to finalise agreements with the last HAR1 project developer to ensure all are ready to proceed.

These developments come as the government confirmed £500M in additional funding for a pioneering hydrogen transport and storage network. This infrastructure upgrade aims to connect hydrogen producers with key consumers, such as power plants and industries, facilitating wider adoption of hydrogen energy.

Additionally, the government plans to consult soon on the possibility of blending hydrogen into the national gas transmission system. If viable, this approach could reduce costs for hydrogen production projects and potentially lower energy bills for consumers, as hydrogen is gradually integrated into supply networks for homes and businesses.

The ongoing investment and policy focus underline the UK’s ambition to transition towards a low-carbon economy, with hydrogen expected to play a central role in decarbonising sectors that have traditionally been difficult to clean up using electricity alone.

Details of the 10 hydrogen projects kicking off now are below.

Hydrogen UK CEO Clare Jackson said: “Signing these contracts demonstrates the confidence and commitment of both the government and industry in building a sustainable hydrogen sector.

“Our members are at the forefront of this transition, and their projects will play a vital role in meeting the UK’s net-zero targets while driving economic growth and job creation.”

Hydrogen Energy Association CEO Emma Guthrie said: “This announcement marks a significant and encouraging milestone for the UK’s hydrogen sector.

“The signing of contracts for 10 projects under HAR1 provides vital momentum and confidence for industry and investors alike.

“We look forward to seeing these projects move into the next phase, helping to scale up the UK’s low carbon hydrogen economy.”

Low Carbon Contracts Company (LCCC) chief executive Neil McDermott said: “LCCC is proud to have signed the UK’s first Low Carbon Hydrogen Agreements, supporting the development of projects under the Hydrogen Production Business Model.

“These agreements provide revenue stability for producers, and a clear signal that low-carbon hydrogen has a key role to play in the UK’s future energy system.

“We look forward to working closely with project developers to bring these projects into operation.”

Kimberly-Clark UK & Ireland managing director Dan Howell said: “We are delighted to be the first UK consumer goods manufacturer to really embrace green hydrogen, showing that manufacturing industries can take the lead and overcome the technical challenge and adopt green hydrogen at scale. This initiative builds on the investments and progress we’ve already made with innovative technologies for our business, our consumers and our customers.”",https://cdn.ca.emap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/07/geopura-jg-pears-HyMarnham-project-560x315.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 11:56:26.928064

This will be Eni’s third biorefinery in Italy, after those in Venice and Gela.

Among the distinctive features of the project, in addition to the use of advanced technologies, there is the possibility of adapting the plant to also produce SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) in the future.

This initiative contributes to the European Union’s decarbonisation goals, with particular reference to the transport sector, and confirms Eni’s energy transition path.

The project is part of Enilive’s strategy to reach more than five million tonnes of biorefinery capacity by 2030.

The European Investment Bank (EIB) and Eni have signed a €500 million 15-year finance contract to support the conversion of Eni’s Livorno refinery in Tuscany into a biorefinery. The agreement was signed today at Eni’s headquarters in San Donato Milanese by EIB Vice-President Gelsomina Vigliotti and Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi.

Eni’s project involves the construction of new plants to produce hydrogenated biofuels at the Livorno refinery site, including a biogenic pre-treatment unit and a 500 000-tonne/year Ecofining™ plant.

Thanks to its proprietary Ecofining™ technology, Eni’s company dedicated to sustainable mobility, Enilive, produces HVO (hydrogenated vegetable oil) – a biofuel made from renewable raw materials[1] such as used cooking oil and agrifood waste. Pure HVO can now be used in approved engines and is distributed through existing infrastructure.

EIB Vice-President Gelsomina Vigliotti said: “The EIB financing is key to delivering a project of high environmental, technological and strategic value, helping to promote the decarbonisation of the transport sector. This is a concrete example of how industrial innovation can accelerate the path towards climate neutrality, while generating sustainable value for regions.”

Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi said: “The agreement with the EIB confirms Eni’s concrete and high-quality commitment in the transition towards increasingly decarbonized energy. It also underscores the validity of our approach, which is to invest and leverage all available and effective initiatives and technologies for reducing emissions. This virtuous approach is now leading us to convert a third refinery into a biorefinery in Italy, following the examples of Venice and Gela.”

HVO biofuels play a key role because they can make an immediate contribution to reducing transport sector emissions generated not only on roads, but also by air traffic, maritime and rail transport (calculated along the entire value chain). The conversion of the Livorno site is in line with Enilive’s strategy to increase the production of biofuels in response to growing demand in Europe and Italy, in order to meet both emission reduction targets under RED III (Renewable Energy Directive) and the obligations to release pure biofuels for use as defined by Italian legislation. Worldwide, it is estimated that the demand for hydrogenated biofuels will increase by 65% over the period 2024-2028[2].

The Livorno biorefinery will be able to treat different types of biogenic charges, mainly waste and residues of plant origin, to produce HVO diesel, HVO naphtha and bio-LPG.

Among the distinctive features of the project, in addition to the adoption of advanced technologies, there is the possibility in the future of modifying the layout of the plant to have the flexibility to also produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is a key element of efforts to decarbonise aviation. This gives flexibility to the investment and brings it up to speed with the environmental priorities of the European Union, broadening the potential impact.

This operation is part of the energy transition at national and European level, contributing substantially to decarbonisation of the transport sector and the reduction of CO2 emissions. It also supports the achievement of Italy’s targets for the production of pure biofuels, which under current legislation provides for a gradual increase in use from 300 000 tonnes per year in 2023 to one million tonnes by 2030.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has raised concerns about the European Union’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandate targets. IATA is of the opinion that these targets could have big economic and environmental effects.

The organization believes the EU’s ambitious mandate might be too hard to meet particularly due to the limited scope of the current global SAF production capacity.

IATA thinks there has to have a smarter way to use Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by balancing our green goals with the cost of achieving them.

Given the present challenges, it is too big a problem to switch to sustainable aviation fuels as mandated by the EU, argued IATA.

Objections to EU’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Mandate: Key Takeaways

IATA criticizes the EU’s SAF mandate as overly ambitious.

Limited global SAF production is a significant concern.

Economic and environmental implications are at the forefront.

A balanced approach to SAF policies is necessary.

IATA advocates for a more feasible SAF blending target.

EU’s SAF Mandate and Its Requirements

The European Union has a plan to make flying greener, by drastically reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from flying. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandate plays a crucial role in this plan.

Key Components of the European Sustainable Aviation Fuel Directive

The European Sustainable Aviation Fuel Mandate sets rules for using SAF. It defines SAF, outlines how it should be made, and ensures everyone follows the rules.

This directive helps make using SAF easier by setting clear rules.

Blending Percentage Targets Through 2050

The EU has big plans for using SAF in flying. They want to use more and more SAF over time. Here’s what they plan:

Implementation Timeline for Airlines

As per the plan, airlines need to follow the EU’s SAF madate starting in 2025. They will have to use more and more SAF over time. This gives them time to get ready.

Greener Goals Behind the Mandate

The EU wants to make flying better for the planet. They aim to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions from flying by more and more of SAF in a time-bound manner and make flying cleaner.

Industry Worries Over SAF Mandate

IATA’s objections to the Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandate reflects the industry’s worries over its economic and other practical implications.

IATA’s statement and paper explain that the goal of cutting carbon emissions is good, but the rules might be too hard to follow. The position paper says the EU’s SAF goals could hurt airlines’ budgets, making flights more expensive for everyone.

Many big airlines are backing IATA’s fight against the EU’s SAF rules.They fear these rules could raise costs and mess up flights and want rules that fit the industry’s current abilities.

Big airlines like Lufthansa and British Airways support IATA’s challenge. They think the EU’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Mandate goals are too high and can’t be met on time.

The unified stance by these airlines shows their dedication to being green, but they also stress the need for realistic rules.

Economic Burden Analysis of SAF Implementation

It’s important to know how these changes are going to affect the airlines’ financial position. SAF will make flying more expensive for airlines, as it costs more than regular jet fuel and limited supply

The price difference between SAF and jet fuel could be huge. It might even double or triple what airlines pay for fuel.

Further, airlines also need to spend on new infrastructure such as updating storage, transport, and maintenance. This adds to the cost.

Passenger Fare Impact Projections

Higher costs for SAF will likely mean higher ticket prices. Fares could go up a lot. This might make people want to fly less.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, said, “We want to cut carbon, but we must do it without hurting airlines or passengers.”

“Moving to SAF is a big step for green flying. But we need to plan carefully to avoid hurting our wallets.”

Environmental Efficacy Concerns Raised by IATA

IATA has raised important environmental concerns about the EU’s SAF rules because of the limitations on SAF production capacity. They think the measures to fix the supply gaps could harm the environment.

Global SAF Production Capacity Limitations

IATA argues that the world can’t make more SAF to meet the EU’s big targets as we don’t have enough places to make SAF.

Key limitations include:

Limited production facilities

Insufficient feedstock supply

Technological constraints

Sustainability Certification and Carbon Accounting Issues

IATA is worried about how SAF is made and counted in carbon emissions. It’s important to make sure SAF is made in a green way. This helps the EU’s SAF rules work better for the planet.

Feedstock Sustainability Questions

IATA is concerned about where SAF’s ingredients come from. They want to make sure these ingredients don’t harm the environment. This includes not causing deforestation or land damage.

Life-Cycle Emissions Analysis

It’s key to know how much carbon SAF really saves. IATA wants clear methods to measure this. This way, we can really see how much SAF helps the environment.

Supply-Demand Mismatch in the SAF Market

A big problem in the aviation world is the gap between SAF supply and demand. The EU wants to use more SAF to cut down on carbon emissions. But, there’s not enough SAF being made to meet this goal.

Current Global Production Capabilities

Right now, we can’t make enough SAF to meet the needs of flying. Most places making SAF are just starting or making a little bit. Most of the SAF made is in a few areas, and it’s not enough for the planes.

EU Demand Projections vs. Available Supply

The EU has big plans for using more SAF in planes. But, there’s not enough SAF to go around. This means there’s a big gap between what’s needed and what’s available. We need to make a lot more SAF to meet the EU’s goals.

Regional Production Disparities

Some places, like the EU and North America, are working hard to make more SAF. But, other areas are not keeping up. This will be big challenge to get enough SAF for everyone.

SAF making technology is getting better. New ways to make SAF and improve existing ones are being developed. However, we need to make SAF faster enough to meet the EU’s targets.

European Commission’s Response to Industry Concerns

The European Commission has listened to IATA’s worries about the SAF mandate. They are thinking about changing the policy. This could include adjusting blending targets and timelines.

Possible Compromise Solutions and Timeline Revisions

There are a few ways to solve the problem. One idea is to let airlines use different ways to meet SAF goals. This could include buying SAF credits or investing in SAF projects.

International Coordination Efforts

Another idea is to work together globally to make more SAF. This could mean working with governments, airlines, and SAF makers to build new facilities and supply chains.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Mandate: Conclusion

The aviation industry is at a crossroads. It must cut down on carbon emissions while staying in business. The European Union wants to make flying greener with new rules on renewable jet fuel.

But, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) worries about the EU’s big plans. They think it might be too hard to meet the targets.

Finding a middle ground is key. We need to look at the cost of green fuel, its real impact, and if there’s enough of it. The EU needs to listen to the industry and find a way to make flying greener without hurting the industry too much.

Changing the timeline and setting more achievable goals could help. This way, the industry can start using cleaner technologies. It will help reduce the carbon footprint of flying.

This latest boost supports the development of clean maritime fuels and technologies, including ammonia, hydrogen, methanol, as well as electric and solar-powered systems.

Supporting innovation and local economies

The investment is a part of the UK government’s bigger push to become a clean energy superpower and meet its net-zero targets for shipping by 2050.

With maritime transport continuing to play an essential role in global trade and emissions, the CMDC is helping to drive innovation while revitalising historic shipbuilding communities.

In Glasgow, funding is supporting new technologies, such as the FastRig, a high-tech wing sail developed by Smart Green Shipping. Built locally and now successfully deployed at sea, this innovation can reduce fuel use and emissions by up to 40% annually. Efforts like this are reviving Scotland’s proud shipbuilding heritage while supporting skilled green jobs and advanced manufacturing.

The £30 million also contributes to a growing portfolio of clean maritime projects funded through UK SHORE, the government’s flagship programme for decarbonising the sector. Currently, over £136 million has been awarded through CMDC to more than 140 organisations across every UK region, with total UK SHORE funding supporting over 300 organisations, including 250 SMEs.

Diane Gilpin, Smart Green Shipping (SGS), CEO said:

“CMDC3 support enabled SGS, a Scottish based business, to demonstrate the safety and robustness of FastRig, our Clyde built wingsails, and to build out our digital decision-making platform, FastReach, which underpins our unique wind-as-a-service proposition.

“Over the last 3 years SGS has invested £7.6 million in R&D, 60% of that in Scotland. We’ve drawn upon engineering design skills in adjacent sectors like renewables and oil and gas, and digital expertise created in Scotland’s vibrant tech community.”

Green infrastructure and skills for the future

Glasgow’s King George V Docks, operated by Peel Ports Clydeport, is receiving £3 million to upgrade infrastructure to handle larger wind turbine components. This investment supports Scotland’s growing role in renewable energy supply chains and highlights how ports are transforming into green energy hubs.

In other areas, successful CMDC projects include electric charging networks at ports, green hydrogen shore power systems in Leith, and the demonstration of an electric crew transfer vessel for offshore wind farms in Aberdeen.

Advanced manufacturing is also being supported through the National Manufacturing Institute Scotland, which has worked on CMDC-funded projects to improve shipbuilding efficiency and reduce emissions. These efforts aim to reduce lead times, localise production, and integrate sustainability into the core of maritime engineering.

Research and development for long-term impact

Alongside this round of CMDC funding, UK SHORE is providing £3.85 million to the Clean Maritime Research Hub, a collaboration of 13 UK universities. The funding will help continue vital research into clean maritime technologies, including the development of a liquid hydrogen facility at Durham University. This work will support the marine sector in understanding the role of hydrogen in future fuel strategies.",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/iStock-2178141159-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 22:56:26.117400

The selection of Energy Dome’s proven and market-ready CO2 Battery technology reflects its ability to be deployed at the scale, speed and affordability required on a global basis.

The CO2 Battery is capable of continuously dispatching energy for periods of 8 to 24 hours, unlocking enough firm electricity to meet both the baseload and flexibility requirements of large energy users. The modular, site-independent product design uses off-the-shelf equipment without supply chain bottlenecks, ensuring a highly scalable solution to store massive amounts of energy efficiently and cost-effectively.

Furthermore, the mechanical components of the technology help stabilize the grid by providing natural inertia from rotating machinery. This is especially important given the concurrent ramp-up of solar and wind (which lack inertia) with the ramp-down of legacy fossil-fuel power stations, whose inertia is lost when the plants are decommissioned. The CO2 Battery thus contributes to maintaining grid resiliency by acting as a shock absorber to smooth out sudden changes in frequency.

“Google is committed to powering our operations with clean energy, and Energy Dome’s technologically proven and scalable long-duration energy storage solution can help us unlock rapid progress,” said Maud Texier, Director of EMEA Energy at Google. “But this isn’t just about Google. By helping to scale this first-of-a-kind LDES technology, we hope to help communities everywhere gain greater access to reliable, affordable electricity and support grid resilience as we integrate more renewable energy sources.”

The commercial agreement aims to develop CO2 Battery projects in all the key geographical strategic areas, including Europe, America, and the Asia-Pacific region, with the goal of scaling up deployment at a rapid pace to meet Google’s 2030 carbon-free energy goals. A pipeline of sites and projects has been identified in the partnership, which are currently in development and contracting stages.

Beyond the commercial collaboration, Google has also made an investment in Energy Dome. The investment coincides with the company entering a growth phase of commercial deployment, and multiple projects already contracted, including with Alliant Energy in the U.S., Engie in Italy, and NTPC in India.

By investing directly in the Milan-based scaleup, Google is reinforcing its long-term commitment to accelerating the commercialization of this proven technology. As a pioneer in the first generation of corporate power purchase agreements when solar and wind were in their infancy, Google brings both the customer perspective and experience to enhance the maturation and commercial scaling of CO2 Battery technology, unlocking adoption benefits for communities and economies.",https://www.renewableenergymagazine.com/ficheroenergias/fotos/energydome.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 01:56:10.802753

Conclusion China Aviation Oil is neither a guaranteed winner nor a value trap.","In the shadow of China's post-pandemic economic rebound, one company stands at the crossroads of opportunity and uncertainty: China Aviation Oil (Singapore) Corporation Ltd (SGX:G92). As the exclusive importer of bonded jet fuel into China's busiest airports and a global player in aviation fuel trading, the firm's fortunes are inextricably tied to the health of the aviation sector. But with a stock price that has underperformed despite robust fundamentals, the question lingers: Is SGX:G92 a mispriced gem or a cautionary tale?

Financial Undervaluation: A Case of Metrics vs. Sentiment

China Aviation Oil's valuation metrics scream for attention. As of July 2025, the stock trades at a trailing P/E ratio of 9.59, significantly below its 13-year median of 10.64 and the Asian Oil and Gas industry average of 11.6x. Its P/B ratio of 0.75 suggests the market values the company at 75% of its book value—a rare discount for a firm with tangible assets and a debt-free balance sheet. The company holds SGD 682.82 million in cash and equivalents, a financial cushion that amplifies its appeal in a volatile sector.

Yet, the stock's current P/E of 9.59 exceeds its estimated fair P/E of 8.7x, a discrepancy that hints at skepticism about future growth. This tension between historical value and forward-looking caution creates a compelling case for investors willing to look beyond short-term volatility.

Strategic Market Position: Monopoly Power in a Fragmented Industry

China Aviation Oil's dominance in the Chinese aviation fuel market is its most formidable asset. As the exclusive importer of bonded jet fuel to airports like Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, the company controls a critical chokepoint in the supply chain. Its 33% stake in Shanghai Pudong International Airport Aviation Fuel Supply and 26% stake in Oilhub Korea Yeosu further cement its infrastructure footprint.

The company's pivot to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) trading adds a layer of future-proofing. With global mandates for low-carbon fuels gaining momentum, CAO's early engagement in SAF positions it to capture margins from a niche market expected to grow at a 20%+ CAGR over the next decade.

Ownership structure also bolsters its strategic credibility. Backed by China National Aviation Fuel Group (CNAF) and BP Investments Asia, the company enjoys institutional support that mitigates operational and political risks. This alignment with global energy giants is a subtle but powerful endorsement.

Long-Term Growth Potential: Riding the Tailwinds of Recovery

The post-pandemic aviation recovery in China is not just a headline—it's a structural shift. While 2024 saw an oversupply of jet fuel (supply outpacing demand by 40%, per Kpler), the long-term fundamentals remain intact. IATA projects a 5.7% CAGR in China's passenger traffic over the next two decades, driven by urbanization, visa liberalization, and the rise of the middle class.

China Aviation Oil's FY2024 results underscore this potential: revenue rose 7.5% to USD 15.5 billion, with net income up 33% to USD 78.4 million. The company's net profit margin improved from 0.4% to 0.5%, a modest but meaningful step toward operational efficiency.

However, the path to growth is not without hurdles. The rise of fuel-efficient aircraft and the rise of high-speed rail alternatives could dampen demand. Additionally, the transition to SAF, while promising, requires significant infrastructure investment and regulatory clarity.

Risks and Realities: A Cautionary Note

The company's recent 8.5% stock price drop following FY2024 results highlights market skepticism. Analysts cite overcapacity in the aviation fuel sector and uncertain margins from SAF as key risks. While CAO's debt-free status is a strength, its reliance on a single market (China) exposes it to geopolitical and regulatory shifts.

Investment Thesis: A Calculated Bet

For long-term investors, China Aviation Oil presents a high-conviction, low-risk opportunity. Its undervalued metrics, strategic moats, and alignment with global decarbonization trends justify a cautious bullish stance. The stock's current discount to intrinsic value—supported by a P/B of 0.75 and strong cash reserves—offers a margin of safety.

Key catalysts to watch:

- SAF adoption rates and regulatory support in China and Asia.

- Expansion of domestic air travel as middle-class disposable income grows.

- Infrastructure investments in storage and logistics, which could unlock new revenue streams.

Investors should consider:

- Diversification to mitigate sector-specific risks.

- Monitoring CAO's capital allocation in SAF and infrastructure.

- Valuation re-rating if the market begins to price in long-term decarbonization trends.

Conclusion

China Aviation Oil is neither a guaranteed winner nor a value trap. It is a company at a crossroads, with a strong foundation and a clear path to growth—if it can navigate the turbulence of overcapacity and shifting demand. For investors with a five- to ten-year horizon, SGX:G92 offers a compelling case of undervaluation and strategic positioning. In a world where energy transitions and geopolitical shifts redefine industries, CAO's jet fuel monopoly and green ambitions could prove to be its greatest assets.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-25 22:56:33.510949
