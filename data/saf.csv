This award marked a milestone for South Korea’s flag carrier and was delivered on October 30th during the CAPA Airline Leader Summit – Asia & Awards for Excellence 2025 which took place in Singapore.

Korean Air was recognized for its exceptional leadership in innovatively transforming the aviation industry in the region. The judges on the CAPA panel specifically called the merger of Korean Air and Asiana Airlines a transformational deal and noted that it enhanced the competitive standing of Korea and the Asian region in global aviation.

Transforming South Korea’s Aviation Landscape

Korean Air’s four-year integration of Asiana Airlines stands as one of the most significant mergers in the global aviation industry. Valued at $1.3 billion, the acquisition granted Korean Air a 63.88% controlling stake in Asiana by December 2024. The merger, approved by 13 international regulators and finalized with U.S. approval, has created a powerful new global airline brand capable of serving millions of passengers more efficiently.

The integration strategy has unified Asiana’s fleet, operations, and network under one banner, while preserving service quality and brand trust. The process involved complex restructuring across aircraft liveries, information systems, crew operations, and corporate branding. Korean Air also introduced its first new logo in 41 years, marking a fresh era for the airline and setting the completion of full rebranding for early 2027.

Building a Global Mega Carrier

Korean Air’s transformation has positioned Incheon International Airport as one of Asia’s most important aviation hubs. The airline’s expanded network now connects passengers to more destinations across Asia, North America, and Europe, offering better connectivity and shorter transfer times.

For travelers, the merger means a more seamless flight experience, unified loyalty programs, and enhanced schedules that reduce layovers between major global routes. Korean Air aims to ensure that this growth translates into a higher-quality experience that reflects both the efficiency of modern aviation and the warmth of Korean hospitality.

SkyTeam Alliance and International Cooperation

Korean Air’s participation in the SkyTeam Alliance’s 25th anniversary celebrations at the CAPA Summit further reinforced its international standing. The carrier highlighted the value of global airline alliances, emphasizing how collaboration with partners such as Delta Air Lines has expanded travel options and improved flight connectivity across the trans-Pacific market.

Through the SkyTeam partnership, Korean Air and Delta now operate a successful trans-Pacific joint venture, offering coordinated flight schedules and shared customer benefits. This collaboration has made Incheon Airport the primary gateway to Asia for travelers flying from the United States, enabling smoother, faster connections to destinations across the region.

Recognition for Strategic Leadership

CAPA’s decision to award Korean Air reflects its success in combining business growth with long-term vision and operational stability. Judges praised the airline for its ability to manage the merger without major disruptions to passengers or the aviation ecosystem.

“This recognition by CAPA validates our team’s dedication to building a sustainable, top-tier global carrier,” said Taejoon Kim, Senior Vice President and Head of International Affairs and Alliances at Korean Air. “We remain focused on completing the integration successfully while delivering exceptional experiences to travelers worldwide.”

He emphasized that the company’s focus now shifts toward sustainability, customer service excellence, and digital transformation, ensuring that Korean Air continues to lead in innovation and safety.

Impact on Travelers and Tourism

The success of the merger is already shaping how tourists and business travelers move through Asia. The combined airline network offers more destinations and improved flight frequencies, reducing travel time between major business hubs like Seoul, Tokyo, Shanghai, and Los Angeles.

For passengers, the integration also enhances loyalty benefits across frequent flyer programs and provides a more cohesive experience, from booking to check-in to inflight services. With a stronger financial base, Korean Air plans to invest in fleet modernization and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) initiatives, reflecting growing demand for eco-conscious travel options.

Tourism experts predict that South Korea’s tourism industry will benefit significantly from the expanded connectivity. Easier access and increased global exposure are expected to drive more inbound visitors, boosting the hospitality, retail, and entertainment sectors.

A Sustainable Future in Aviation

Korean Air’s leadership in sustainability was also recognized by CAPA as part of its award. The airline continues to invest in reducing carbon emissions, optimizing fuel efficiency, and introducing next-generation aircraft such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350.

The company’s sustainability roadmap aims to align with South Korea’s national Net Zero 2050 plan, supporting the transition to green aviation through partnerships with international fuel providers and research institutions.

For travelers, this means an environmentally responsible flying experience that does not compromise on comfort or quality — a crucial consideration for today’s eco-aware passengers.

Reshaping the Competitive Landscape of Asian Aviation

The merger of Korean Air and Asiana Airlines is expected to influence broader trends in Asian aviation. Analysts anticipate that other regional carriers may pursue similar alliances or consolidations to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving market.

Korean Air’s leadership demonstrates how regional cooperation, digital integration, and sustainability can drive global success. The newly expanded airline is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping future passenger expectations and industry standards.

Korean Air’s Vision for Global Excellence

By January 2027, the airline intends to fully integrate Asiana and will continue to focus on providing a premium flying experience, which blends contemporary efficiency with culturally rooted genuine service.

For global travelers, receiving an award from Korean Air is more than an accolade for past efforts; it is a commitment for the future centered on the customers, innovation, and sustainability.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ko-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 12:56:17.175015

meisten angeflogenen internationalen Zielen sein.

Mit Infrastrukturentwicklungen wie dem Hongqiao Air-Rail Transfer Center und

externen Stadtterminals stärkt China Eastern Airlines das integrierte Luft-

Boden-Verkehrsnetzwerk des Jangtse-Deltas. Im Jahr 2024 beförderte die

Fluggesellschaft 8,358 Millionen internationale Transferpassagiere am Pudong

International Airport. Dies entspricht 80,9 % des Gesamtvolumens des Flughafens.

In der ersten Hälfte des Jahres 2025 stieg diese Zahl auf 4,795 Millionen und

damit um 26,8 % gegenüber dem Vorjahr. Dies unterstreicht ihre zentrale Rolle

für die Steigerung der internationalen Transferleistung von Shanghai Pudong.

This is made possible by researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in the US who developed a process that produces sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) without blending it with fossil fuels, meeting industry standards.

How did we turn food waste into an innovative sustainable fuel?

This solution tackles two major problems, mainly food waste and greenhouse gas emissions from aviation. It was led by transforming the food waste directly into biocrude oil, for which the research team used hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Then a two-fold process was adopted to achieve the SAF:

Simple impurities like moisture, ash and salt were removed. Then unwanted elements like nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur were eradicated using catalytic hydrotreating, leaving behind pure hydrocarbons.

To finally meet the industry standards of jet fuel, cobalt molybdenum was used as a catalyst to refine oil into pure hydrocarbons. Further optimisation was conducted by adjusting key variables to eventually progress the fuel to the final production stage.

How does it meet industry standards?

The resultant fuel was tested to meet the rigorous standards of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). It did not require any blending of fossil fuels or additive elements. Therefore, meeting the industry standards, successfully clearing both Tier Alpha and Beta prescreening tests.

Alongside, we are solving the major issue of ‘food waste’ as stated under the Sustainable Development Goals by the United Nations. According to the SDG report, in 2022, globally 19% of food was wasted amounting to 1.05 billion tonnes. This wasted food then adds to the global greenhouse gas emissions when it decomposes in landfills and wastewater treatment plants.

Since this wasted food could be recycled on a large-scale, it could open up opportunities for fuel production. The researchers also stated that this process can be adapted to other oils to produce SAF.

Usually innovations pose a hindrance for commercial production however, this solution has the potential to serve the market as well as create replacement for petroleum-derived compounds in plastics. How drastically can this innovation change the future of sustainability in the aviation sector? Let us know in the comments below!

Una visión que refleja tanto las ambiciones como las tensiones internas del proceso de integración en la defensa española.
En uno de sus análisis recientes, señala que “la revitalización de la defensa española sólo será sostenible si se basa en criterios estratégicos y de seguridad nacional”.
Con esa advertencia sobre la mesa, el rearme europeo se entiende también como un ejercicio de capacidades concretas.","Europa ha entrado en una nueva era de rearme. La invasión rusa de Ucrania reabrió una carrera armamentística que parecía superada, y los gobiernos del continente han vuelto a mirar a su industria de defensa con urgencia.

Este es el retrato de quién es quién en la defensa española, cuánto pesan realmente y qué papel juegan en el rearme del continente.

Oportunidades y desafíos en el rearme europeo

Un estudio elaborado por PwC para la patronal TEDAE ofrece una panorámica precisa del peso industrial que la defensa tiene hoy en España. Según ese informe, publicado en 2024, las industrias de Defensa, Seguridad, Aeronáutica y Espacio generaron 21.919 millones de euros de PIB (1,4% del PIB nacional) y 260.049 empleos entre directos, indirectos e inducidos. El documento no establece un ranking, pero sí deja claro que el ecosistema español de defensa es uno de los más diversificados de Europa.

El impulso del sector no avanza sin fricciones. En una entrevista con El País, el presidente de Indra, Ángel Escribano, reconocía que España aún carece de un gigante comparable a Rheinmetall, Thales o Leonardo. “Necesitamos una mayor dimensión”, señalaba, y añadía que el objetivo no es crear un “campeón nacional”, sino consolidar un tejido donde las empresas cooperen y compartan capacidades. Una visión que refleja tanto las ambiciones como las tensiones internas del proceso de integración en la defensa española.

La reactivación industrial no basta por sí sola para garantizar una defensa sostenible. El Real Instituto Elcano advierte de que el esfuerzo de rearme no puede medirse solo en cifras de inversión o contratos firmados. En uno de sus análisis recientes, señala que “la revitalización de la defensa española sólo será sostenible si se basa en criterios estratégicos y de seguridad nacional”. Para ello, propone reforzar la llamada “cultura estratégica”, una visión a largo plazo que trascienda la lógica industrial y que permita definir con claridad qué papel quiere desempeñar España en el entramado de seguridad europeo.

Con esa advertencia sobre la mesa, el rearme europeo se entiende también como un ejercicio de capacidades concretas. Detrás de cada contrato, de cada programa europeo, hay fábricas, ingenierías y astilleros que sostienen el esfuerzo de modernización. España no parte de cero: cuenta con una red de empresas que han crecido al calor de los grandes proyectos de la OTAN y la Unión Europea. Algunas de ellas son públicas, otras privadas, pero todas forman parte de un mismo ecosistema que hoy vuelve a cobrar protagonismo.

Los nombres que están definiendo la nueva industria de defensa en España

Navantia es el principal referente de la industria naval española y una pieza esencial en el rearme europeo. De sus astilleros en Ferrol, Cartagena y Cádiz han salido buques para la Armada española y para marinas de todo el mundo, como las fragatas F-100 o las corbetas Avante. En la actualidad, concentra esfuerzos en dos programas estratégicos: las fragatas F-110, con un contrato de 4.325 millones de euros, y los submarinos S-80. La F-111 “Bonifaz”, primera unidad de la serie F-110, fue botada el 11 de septiembre de 2025 y la entrega del primer buque está prevista para 2028. En submarinos, el S-82, la segunda unidad de las clases S-80, fue amadrinado el 3 de octubre de 2025.

Pero hay más. Con unos ingresos de 1.528 millones de euros en 2024 y más de 5.600 empleados, la compañía pública apuesta por el modelo “astillero 4.0” para modernizarse y así responder a la creciente demanda de capacidades marítimas de sus clientes.

Indra actúa como columna vertebral tecnológica de la defensa española: integra sistemas C4ISR, radares, guerra electrónica y simulación, y es el coordinador nacional en el programa FCAS para los pilares de sensores y nube de combate. Su legado en Eurofighter —con aviónica, ayudas defensivas y modernizaciones— se complementa con contratación sostenida en defensa. Indra cerró 2024 con 4.843 millones de ingresos y una cartera de 7.245 millones. A ello suma demostradores de “combat cloud” con el Ejército del Aire y del Espacio.

ITP Aero es el motor literal y figurado de la defensa española. Especializada en diseño, fabricación y mantenimiento de turbinas, forma parte de los programas más avanzados de Europa, desde el Eurofighter hasta el futuro sistema FCAS, donde lidera en España el desarrollo del motor de nueva generación. En 2024 destinó 102 millones de euros a I+D —un 55% más que el año anterior— y cerró el ejercicio con 1.612 millones de ingresos. Su expansión industrial incluye la planta de Ajalvir, con una inversión millonaria para mantenimiento de motores GTF, y el refuerzo de su centro de Zamudio. Estas inversiones consolidan su papel como proveedor estratégico de propulsión en la OTAN y la UE.

SAPA es el gran especialista español en movilidad de vehículos blindados y una de las pocas empresas europeas con capacidad propia para desarrollar transmisiones de nueva generación. Su tecnología equipa al vehículo 8×8 Dragón del Ejército de Tierra. Además, ha sido seleccionada por General Dynamics Land Systems para suministrar transmisiones a programas del Ejército de Estados Unidos vinculados al reemplazo del Bradley (XM30), un acuerdo industrial de largo recorrido valorado por la prensa en hasta 5.000 millones de euros. Con sede en Guipúzcoa, la compañía trabaja en sistemas híbridos y eléctricos para plataformas militares, en línea con las tendencias.

Escribano Mechanical & Engineering representa la cara más dinámica del nuevo tejido industrial español. Especializada en estaciones de armas remotamente controladas (RWS), optrónica y munición inteligente, la compañía ha logrado posicionarse como proveedor clave del vehículo 8×8 Dragón y de la Armada.En 2024 alcanzó una facturación de 355 millones de euros e invirtió 62 millones en I+D, reforzando su independencia tecnológica con la apertura de una nueva planta en Linares. Su crecimiento ha despertado el interés de Indra, que ha iniciado un proceso de adquisición para integrar capacidades.

GMV es uno de los grandes nombres españoles en sistemas de mando, control y ciberdefensa. Con 454 millones de euros de facturación en 2024 y una presencia internacional que supera el 75% de su negocio, la empresa combina capacidades civiles y militares en áreas clave como navegación por satélite, seguridad espacial y comunicaciones seguras. Participa en seis proyectos del Fondo Europeo de Defensa, coordinando dos de ellos —PRECISE y MYRIAD—, y mantiene contratos con la Agencia Europea del Espacio (EUSPA) para servicios de alerta y vigilancia del sistema Galileo. Su perfil dual la convierte en un socio esencial para la autonomía estratégica europea en materia de ciberseguridad y espacio.

Sener Aeroespacial, filial del grupo SENER, combina ingeniería de precisión y visión industrial en los ámbitos aeroespacial y de defensa. Participa en una veintena de proyectos financiados por el Fondo Europeo de Defensa, entre ellos el desarrollo del sistema de misiles hipersónicos HYDEF y el programa COMMANDS para convoyes autónomos. Con 710 millones de euros de ingresos en 2024 y más de 4.000 empleados, la compañía mantiene su sede en Zamudio y una red internacional que abarca espacio, guiado, control y sistemas no tripulados. Su estrategia pasa por integrar capacidades duales —civiles y militares— y reforzar su presencia en los proyectos europeos que definirán la defensa del futuro.

Tecnobit, perteneciente al Grupo Oesía, es uno de los principales proveedores españoles de aviónica, optrónica y sistemas de comunicaciones seguras. Con sede en Valdepeñas y más de 3.000 empleados en el conjunto del grupo, participa en programas como el FCAS y el Eurofighter, aportando electrónica de misión, enlaces de datos y simulación. En 2024 reforzó su posición en el mercado europeo con nuevas inversiones en sensores infrarrojos y tecnologías de visión artificial.

La defensa española encara una década decisiva. El auge del gasto y los programas europeos ofrecen una oportunidad de crecimiento sin precedentes, pero también la obligación de coordinar un ecosistema todavía fragmentado. Como señalan algunos expertos, la autonomía tecnológica europea no se logrará solo con inversión, sino con una estrategia que combine soberanía, innovación y eficiencia industrial.

Siemens Group and RIC Energy have signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly develop projects related to renewable hydrogen, green ammonia, and synthetic fuels in Spain. The agreement is part of the Compostilla Green project, located in Cubillos del Sil, which was ranked as the top initiative under the Hydrogen Valleys programme.

A cross-sector partnership structured around technology and financing

The agreement involves several Siemens Group entities, including Siemens S.A., Siemens Industry Software, Siemens Financial Services, and Siemens Innovation Strategies. The partnership covers both technical and financial aspects, with a particular focus on developing joint solutions and exploring structured financing mechanisms for the projects.

The two companies aim to improve operational efficiency, industrial decarbonisation, site safety, and the advanced digitalisation of infrastructure. These priorities form part of a long-term industrial deployment strategy supported by digital technologies and integrated financial approaches.

Large-scale projects across two Spanish industrial regions

In addition to Compostilla Green, the agreement also includes the Besaya project, located in Torrelavega in the Cantabria region. This second site is aligned with the development of sustainable industrial fuels and aims to mobilise new technological and logistical capacities in the region.

Both partners plan to implement a joint communication strategy to highlight the economic impact of these projects on the regions involved. They are also considering the establishment of vertically integrated consortiums to facilitate execution of the planned initiatives.

Strengthening industrial cooperation in alternative fuels

The leaders of both companies welcomed the formalisation of this alliance. José Luis Moya, Chief Executive Officer of RIC Energy, described the agreement as an opportunity to “accelerate the deployment of transformative projects in the field of hydrogen and its derivatives”.

Estrategia Española de Economía Circular: España Circular 2030.
Estrategia España Turismo 2030.","En el extenso lapso de tiempo que media entre enero de 2019, cuando se dieron a conocer las “Directrices Generales de la Estrategia de Turismo Sostenible de España 2030”, y la aprobación el pasado 21 de octubre de 2025 en Consejo de Ministros de la “Estrategia España Turismo 2030”, encontramos, en lo que respecta al tema que aquí se aborda, la “Estrategia Española de Economía Circular: España Circular 2030”, aprobada por el Consejo de Ministros el 2 de junio de 2020. Veamos cómo se articulan para diseñar un marco de transformación para este sector.

La “Estrategia España Turismo 2030” sitúa la economía circular como uno de los pilares fundamentales para la transformación del modelo turístico nacional. En un contexto marcado por la emergencia climática, la presión sobre los recursos naturales y la necesidad de transiciones ecológicas y digitales, el documento plantea una reconfiguración profunda del sector turístico, orientada a la sostenibilidad ambiental, social y económica. Esta estrategia no solo reconoce los impactos negativos del modelo lineal tradicional, sino que propone mecanismos para avanzar hacia un modelo circular que reduzca el consumo de recursos, prolongue la vida útil de productos y servicios, y promueva la reutilización y el reciclaje.

La economía circular aparece como una meta estratégica específica (Meta 6), lo que representa una novedad relevante en el marco de las políticas turísticas españolas. El documento afirma que “las empresas del sector contribuyen ya a la disminución de las emisiones y promueven la economía circular en toda la cadena de valor turística. Pero hay que profundizar en esta meta, pues es un paso crucial para avanzar en la senda de un turismo responsable con el medio ambiente y comprometido con la preservación de nuestro planeta” (p. 75). Esta declaración refleja el compromiso institucional con la circularidad como eje vertebrador de la sostenibilidad turística.

Entre las medidas que se proponen, destacan aquellas orientadas a la gestión eficiente de los recursos hídricos, la reducción del desperdicio alimentario, la minimización del uso de plásticos y envases, y la mejora de la eficiencia energética en los establecimientos turísticos. En relación con el agua, se señala que “es necesario avanzar en sistemas de reutilización de agua (para riego o baldeo, mediante recuperación de aguas grises en alojamientos…), en la eficiencia del uso del agua en el consumo turístico, para lo que resulta necesario medir y trazar el consumo turístico con indicadores específicos (litros por pernoctación, auditorías, reducción de fugas)” (p. 60). Esta propuesta implica una sofisticación en la medición y trazabilidad del consumo, apoyada en tecnologías digitales y soluciones basadas en la naturaleza.

En cuanto al desperdicio alimentario, la Estrategia se alinea con la Ley 1/2025 de prevención de las pérdidas y el desperdicio alimentario, promoviendo prácticas sostenibles en el sector de la restauración turística. Se reconoce que “el sector turístico tiene potencial de mejora, ya que aún hay hábitos o factores como el exceso de producción, la gestión del inventario, o los hábitos de consumo, en los que se puede incidir” (p. 60). Esta afirmación subraya la necesidad de intervenir en los procesos operativos de las empresas turísticas para reducir los excedentes y optimizar la gestión de recursos.

Respecto a los plásticos y envases, el documento recoge la normativa europea que establece metas de reducción y reciclaje, y propone la incorporación del sector turístico a la “Global Tourism Plastics Initiative”. Se destaca que “existe un potencial de colaboración por explorar entre la industria del envase y sectores como el turístico para facilitar la inversión en soluciones tecnológicas alineadas con la nueva regulación europea” (p. 61), lo que abre la puerta a alianzas intersectoriales (o simbiosis industrial) para la innovación circular.

La Estrategia también contempla la descarbonización del transporte turístico como parte de la transición hacia la circularidad. Se menciona el impulso de combustibles alternativos, como el SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), y la electrificación del parque automovilístico, así como la promoción de la movilidad urbana sostenible mediante Zonas de Bajas Emisiones. Estas medidas se articulan con el Plan Nacional Integrado de Energía y Clima (PNIEC 2021-2030) y con el Reglamento (UE) 2023/2405 sobre transporte aéreo sostenible.

Además, se propone el desarrollo de un prototipo de plan de gestión de residuos para el sector turístico, la incorporación del sector a iniciativas internacionales sobre plásticos, y la implementación de proyectos piloto en destinos y establecimientos turísticos apoyados por el Sistema de Sostenibilidad e Inteligencia Turística Integral (SSITI). Estas acciones se complementan con incentivos para que las empresas calculen su huella de carbono y la compensen a través del Registro de Huella de Carbono del MITECO.

En términos institucionales, la Estrategia asigna responsabilidades a la Secretaría de Estado de Turismo, SEGITTUR, Paradores de Turismo y otros ministerios como el de Transición Ecológica y el de Agricultura, Pesca y Alimentación. Esta articulación interministerial y público-privada refuerza la gobernanza colaborativa como condición para la implementación efectiva de la economía circular en el turismo.

Este enfoque es complementario al documento “España Circular 2030”, que establece un marco estratégico nacional para la transición hacia una economía circular en todos los sectores productivos, incluyendo explícitamente al turismo como uno de los sectores prioritarios. En dicho documento se afirma que “aunque la Estrategia Española de Economía Circular está dotada de un carácter transversal y multidisciplinar, se ha decidido realizar una planificación y un seguimiento especial de algunos sectores debido a su relevancia: […] el turismo” (España Circular 2030, p. 7). Esta inclusión refuerza la coherencia entre ambas estrategias, al reconocer que el turismo, por su peso económico y su impacto ambiental, debe ser objeto de políticas específicas de circularidad.

Desde la perspectiva académica, los trabajos de Vargas-Sánchez han anticipado y analizado críticamente muchos de estos planteamientos. En su artículo “Innovación y Economía Circular en el Turismo” (2022), se destaca que “la toma de conciencia entre los empresarios parece existir, pero se echa en falta una acción colectiva a nivel de destino que la canalice en acciones concretas articuladas en un plan”. Esta observación pone de relieve una brecha entre el reconocimiento conceptual de la circularidad y su implementación práctica en muchos destinos. Asimismo, en una publicación de 2020 sobre “Simbiosis industrial en destinos turísticos”, Vargas-Sánchez propone modelos de colaboración interempresarial que permiten cerrar ciclos de recursos a nivel local, en línea con los principios de la economía circular.

En otro trabajo, “The new face of the tourism industry under a circular economy” (2021), el autor plantea escenarios estratégicos para la transición hacia una economía circular turística, combinando enfoques de gestión estratégica y de teoría institucional. Más recientemente, en “Toward a Circular Tourism Industry: The Importance of a Start-Up Ecosystem” (2023), se analiza el papel de las startups tecnológicas como catalizadores de la circularidad en el turismo.

Estos trabajos no solo se alinean con los objetivos de las estrategias nacionales, sino que también aportan una visión territorializada y operativa que puede enriquecer su aplicación. En particular, la insistencia en la necesidad de gobernanza colaborativa, innovación organizativa y planificación estratégica a nivel de destino turístico refuerza la idea de que la circularidad no puede ser solo una aspiración normativa, sino una práctica articulada desde lo local.

En definitiva, la “Estrategia España Turismo 2030” y la “Estrategia Española de Economía Circular: España Circular 2030” se complementan en la construcción de un nuevo modelo turístico basado en la sostenibilidad y la circularidad. Ambas estrategias comparten principios, objetivos y mecanismos de implementación, y ofrecen un marco coherente para que el turismo español se transforme en un sector resiliente, competitivo y comprometido con la transición ecológica. Los aportes académicos, como los citados y muchos otros, refuerzan esta visión, al ofrecer evidencia empírica y propuestas concretas que pueden servir de guía para la acción.

He said the inclusion of the stance in the agreed statement was an example of the maturity with which Z Energy had approached the litigation.","Fuel retailer Z Energy has apologised for any confusion caused by a 2022 advertising campaign that said it was in the business of getting out of the petrol business.

Consumer NZ and two environmental groups took legal action claiming the campaign was misleading and greenwashing.

During 2022 and 2023 a large scale 'Moving With The Times' campaign was conducted through print, television, billboards and social media outlined Z Energy's commitment to alternative fuels and emission reductions.

But in 2023 Consumer NZ, Lawyers for Climate Action New Zealand, and the Environmental Law Initiative sought High Court declarations that Z Energy had misled New Zealanders with its messaging in the campaign.

All parties have now agreed to settle the action with an agreement to disagree, but with no admission of liability nor payments.

Z's chief executive, Lindis Jones, said the campaign was meant to be provocative but not misleading.

He said the company would keep selling fuel, but was working to be a lower carbon business such as extending its electric vehicle charging network.

A shared statement from each party was published in the Sunday Star Times and New Zealand Herald on Sunday.

""Z apologises for any confusion caused by parts of its campaign and to any customers who thought Z was going to stop selling petrol any time soon,"" a joint statement said.

All parties said they were concerned about greenwashing, and backed the need for accuracy of communication which consumers could rely on.

They jointly called on the government to back ""bipartisan policies and strategies to ensure that NZ's emissions reductions targets will be achieved"".

Z campaign provocative but not misleading

Z Energy chief executive Lindis Jones said he had no problem apologising for any confusion, but stood by its contention that Z was participating in energy transition.

""I don't believe any customer should be confused by anything we say now or in the future, and the fact some might have been confused was good enough for me for an apology.

""But that message was designed to be provocative, and called on customers to think of Z Energy as more than just a fuel retailer,"" Jones said.

He said the background information at the time about biofuels, Z's emissions reduction, and investment in EV charging supported its broader message of being part of the change process.

Statements increased Z Energy market share: Lawyer

Last year lawyer James Every-Palmer told the High Court in Wellington the fuel supplier touted the ownership of a biofuel plant that had actually shut down in 2022 and investment in EV charging facilities which were ""insubstantial by any measure"".

He said the company was New Zealand's second highest greenhouse gas emitter - accounting for nearly 15 percent of the country's emissions.

Apology 'sends a message': Consumer NZ

Chief executive of Consumer NZ, Jon Duffy said both sides had made compromises in accepting a settlement.

""What Z's apology does do is it sends a message to other entities that may be considering advertising - that gets close to greenwashing - and my hope is that they will think twice,"" Duffy said.

He said the settlement allowed for a statement to be made in a more timely fashion - instead of waiting until 2028 for a decision to be reached.

""That's nearly six years from when the actual advertising went out in the public. It isn't good enough, given the urgency of climate change.""

A joint call for government leadership on climate change

Duffy said an important element of the settlement was all parties jointly calling for greater leadership from the government on transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy.

""So to have a major fossil fuel emitter come out and acknowledge both that greenwashing has been underenforced and that there's a lack of leadership from government on climate change, is a pretty big deal I think,"" Duffy said.

He said the inclusion of the stance in the agreed statement was an example of the maturity with which Z Energy had approached the litigation.

Z's Jones cited sustainable aviation fuel as an area the government could lead on and ensure suitable policy settings.

""The airlines, the energy companies like Z, and the government have to work together and collaborate and not just wait for each other and that's absolutely essential to meet challenging and significant problems when it comes to climate change.""

A line in the sand

The Environmental Law Initiative's director of research and legal, Matthew Hall said the precedent set by the settlement drew an important ""line in the sand"" for corporate conduct in New Zealand.

""We saw this campaign and we wanted to call it out and the settlement that we've achieved has these components that we think are important to put corporate New Zealand on notice that if greenwashing occurs then we are prepared to scrutinise company's claims and hold them publicly to account.

""Obviously Z has not admitted liability - and doesn't think this is greenwashing - but we think that the settlement does achieve a large part of what we set out [to] at the beginning,"" Hall said.

Government provides statement

Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, Scott Simpson said the government was progressing changes to the Fair Trading Act to strengthen it's enforcement regime.

""The Fair Trading Act 1986 applies to all businesses and requires them to be truthful when it comes to all types of claims, including environmental claims.

""Any statements about environmental credentials must be truthful, backed by evidence, and not misleading, regardless of whether the business is subject to mandatory reporting requirements,"" Simpson said.

He said Commerce Commission guidelines were available to give businesses practical advice to help them comply with the Act.",https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--dTcSIZL2--/t_tohu-badge-facebook/v1643244757/4P8HWTZ_image_crop_5183?_a=BACCd2AD,N,,2025-11-02 08:56:18.346434

New York – La spinta americana verso l’energia pulita ha subito una battuta d’arresto nel 2024. Secondo un nuovo rapporto dell’Energy Information Administration (Eia), l’aumento della capacità di produzione di biocarburanti negli Stati Uniti è notevolmente rallentato, con un tasso di crescita inferiore a un terzo rispetto agli anni precedenti (2022 e 2023). Un segnale preoccupante per le ambizioni climatiche di Washington, soprattutto nel cruciale settore dei trasporti.

Il segmento più colpito da questo rallentamento è quello del diesel rinnovabile e degli “altri biocarburanti”, una categoria che include il fondamentale Sustainable Aviation Fuel (Saf), essenziale per decarbonizzare l’aviazione. Insieme, questi comparti hanno registrato un aumento di capacità di appena 391 milioni di galloni all’anno, un dato significativamente al di sotto delle proiezioni. Nell’intero anno, sono stati completati solo due grandi progetti in California, tra cui la conversione della raffineria Phillips 66 Rodeo. Tuttavia, i guadagni sono stati in parte erosi dalla chiusura di otto impianti di biodiesel in tutto il Paese, costretti a interrompere le operazioni a causa di margini operativi ridotti e della difficoltà di sostenere i costi di produzione.

Questa frenata inattesa si scontra con il forte sostegno politico e i massicci incentivi fiscali previsti dall’Inflation Reduction Act (Ira). Nonostante l’Ira sia una solida base per il supporto finanziario e i crediti d’imposta per la produzione di biocarburanti a basse emissioni, la complessità burocratica, le incertezze normative sull’uso delle materie prime e gli elevati costi di costruzione e start-up dei nuovi impianti stanno rallentando gli investimenti e la messa in opera dei progetti annunciati.

Solo il settore dell’etanolo da carburante, che costituisce il 73% della capacità totale di biocarburanti, ha mostrato un incremento, ma il surplus produttivo è destinato in gran parte alle esportazioni, dal momento che il consumo interno di etanolo si mantiene stabile. La contrazione nella crescita del diesel rinnovabile e del Saf solleva, dunque, interrogativi sulla capacità degli Stati Uniti di rispettare i propri impegni internazionali e di accelerare la transizione energetica in settori ad alta intensità carbonica.",https://www.shipmag.it/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/biofuel.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 12:00:52.358049

Email address Thank you!

One person’s trash is another person’s… jet fuel? Strange as it might sound, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign believe that they’ve figured out a process to make that unlikely scenario a reality–at least on a small scale.

Writing this week in Nature Communications, the agricultural engineers outlined a strategy for taking excess food waste, converting it into biofuel, and then “upgrading” that fuel into jet fuel that can go straight into a plane without requiring additional changes to the aircraft’s infrastructure. They compared their food-waste-derived fuel against industry benchmarks and found that it met all the necessary standards for conventional jet fuel.

Though these findings are still more of a proof of concept, they open up the exciting possibility of using food waste (which there’s certainly no shortage of) to help the aviation industry move closer to its ambitious goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions within the next three decades.

“In a linear economy, we just produce something, use it, and throw it away. In this project, we take the waste and recover the energy and materials to make a usable product. This fills a missing link in the circular paradigm,” University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang said in a statement.

Planes lag behind cars in emission reductions

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that transportation accounted for roughly 29 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in 2022 alone. Of that, about seven percent came from commercial aircraft. Modern cars have reduced emissions in recent years, in part thanks to the shift toward electric battery power. And while battery-powered airplanes are theoretically possible for some short flights, they simply don’t provide enough energy to power a passenger jet traveling across the country(jet fuel carries around 50 times more energy per kilogram than conventional lithium-ion batteries. As a result, jets have lagged behind cars in reducing emissions.

But what about so-called biomass-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)? Some estimates suggest that SAF, which largely refers to fuels derived from organic materials, could reduce emissions from flying by up to 80 percent, compared to conventional jet fuel. While ethanol and other biomass-based derivatives have been available for cars for decades, they have remained more elusive for airplanes because their chemical composition does not meet the much stricter requirements necessary for jet fuel.

Upgrading biomass to jet fuel

Meeting these requirements is where food waste comes in. In this new experiment, the team started by collecting food waste from nearby food-processing plants. They then used a chemical process called hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), which essentially mimics the way the Earth naturally creates crude oil from organic matter over millions of years, except without all the waiting. HTL kind of acts like an advanced “pressure cooker” to fast-forward nature’s timeline.

With plenty of crude oil extracted from the food scraps, the researchers then set out to convert it into jet fuel through a two-part process. The first step involved removing salt, ash, moisture, and other impurities. After that, they used a cleaning process called catalytic hydrotreating to eliminate other undesirable elements such as nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen. What remained were the specific hydrocarbons required to make jet fuel. They tested different catalysts and found that cobalt–molybdenum stood out as the most effective and commercially available metallic catalyst for driving the chemical reactions needed to refine the oil into aviation fuel.

The team took their food-waste derived aviation fuels and tested it against current fuel standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration. It passed the screening test and met industry requirements without needing to introduce any special additives. That means, the fuel would theoretically power a commercial airplane.

The findings are a first step to show aviation fuel derived from food waste is at least possible. Actually making enough of it to supply an entire passenger jet, however, is another beast altogether. Scaling up at this level requires time, resources, and deep pocket books outside of academia.

The world has been grappling with the reality that the conventional oil and gas sectors are coming to a climactic end in the near future. As demand for conventional energy production declines due to decarbonization goals and an increase in renewable energy production, Europe’s refineries have been urged by industry experts to modernize operations to integrate the renewable energy sector or face a grim future.

The world is entering a new phase that calls for aging energy infrastructure to adapt or die

The entire planet has been consumed by the calls for a more diversified energy market that can ensure a more integrated energy supply that does not rely on one specific energy generation method. For far too long, the world has relied on coal and gas to meet energy needs, which has devastated the environment.

At the Argus Global Markets Conference, delegates contemplated the best methods to modernize the European energy market, with aging refineries being the major sticking point. It has been stated by industry insiders that European refineries need to embrace biofuel and renewable energy production to remain competitive in the face of a litany of hurdles in the sector.

Since early 2024, Europe has lost around 400,000 b/d of refining capacity and has seen five refineries closed in the past two years. March saw three such closures of refineries in Europe, with Eni’s 88,400 b/d Livorno refinery in Italy being repurposed as a hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) plant.

Argus Global Markets Conference identified factors influencing the closing of European refineries

While some in the energy industry have welcomed the increased reliance on renewable energy, others in the market have lamented a future without gas and coal. Industry panelists at the Argus Global Markets Conference have noted several mitigating factors that have affected the recent closures, including but not limited to:

IMO’s Emissions Control Areas

The European Union’s ReFuelEU aviation mandate

The EU’s recast Renewable Energy Directive (RED III)

The EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)

These key factors will reduce oil product demand and weigh in on refining margins on the European continent. European energy stakeholders have made several statements that outline the issues faced by the sector.

“Refiners in Europe must adapt to this “hostile climate” for fossil fuel production by “teaching an old refinery new tricks. Co-processing biofuel feedstocks alongside crude oil is key to meeting mandates and keeping European plants competitive” – Lukasz Strupczewski, executive director of crude trading at Polish firm Orlen

As nations outside the European Union see billions of dollars of new investments coming their way, the European energy sector has been urged to heed the warnings coming from industry experts and develop innovative solutions to the potential crisis at hand.

Industry stakeholders have made several suggestions to adapt the European refineries network

One such stakeholder is Grazvydas Bajoras, director at Swiss-based aviation fuel supplier iFuel.

Honeywell has introduced a new technology designed to convert biomass into renewable fuels for the hard-to-decarbonize shipping and aviation sectors. According to Barron's, these two sectors collectively account for 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, a figure projected to rise.

Emissions from aviation have quadrupled since the 1960s, despite a doubling in energy efficiency. With only 10% of the global population currently using air travel, further emissions growth is anticipated. Maritime shipping, reliant on heavy fuel oil or bunker oil, would rank as the world's sixth-highest emitter if it were a country.

A common challenge for both sectors is the need for extremely energy-dense fuels to carry heavy loads over long ranges without frequent refueling. ""The energy density of oil-based fuels is particularly important in these sectors,"" according to Barron's. While biomass was previously not a feasible replacement due to insufficient waste oil supply, biofuels from cellulosic crops and agricultural wastes were identified as future possibilities.

Honeywell's new Biocrude Upgrading process technology is designed to run on byproducts from agriculture and forestry. The system converts this biomass into a more sustainable alternative to marine fuel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and gasoline.

""With higher energy density than many current biofuel alternatives, this renewable marine fuel can extend a vessels range without requiring costly engine upgrades,"" Honeywell stated. The ability to use the fuel without changing engine infrastructure is a key feature.

The relationship between Brazil and Mexico has entered a phase of strategic consolidation. In a telephone conversation this week, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and President Claudia Sheinbaum reinforced Brazil-Mexico cooperation aimed at expanding ethanol production. A renewable fuel that plays a central role in the energy agenda of both countries. The initiative seeks to combine Brazilian technical expertise with Mexican efforts to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and develop a domestic market for biofuels.

The dialogue also confirmed the mutual interest in transforming this partnership into a hub for regional sustainable development. expansion of agreements Bilateral agreements on biofuels, sustainable aviation, and social programs linked to energy security reflect a new stage in Latin American environmental diplomacy. The goal is to establish an integration model that combines technological innovation, sustainability, and economic strengthening between the region's two largest economies.

Brazil-Mexico Cooperation: A Strategic Energy Axis

Brazil is the world's largest producer of sugarcane and a global leader in the production of agricultural-based ethanol.

Mexico, under the leadership of Claudia Sheinbaum, intends to use this experience as a model to modernize its energy matrix.

Brazil-Mexico cooperation will allow for the transfer of technical knowledge, promote joint investments, and accelerate pilot projects for biofuels in Mexican territory.

The Declaration of Intent on Bilateral Cooperation establishes guidelines for the advancement of sustainable fuels, including ethanol and SAF (sustainable aviation fuel).

The plan also includes support for market regulation and the training of specialists in the energy sector.

This integration represents a decisive step towards expanding the regional influence of both nations in the field of clean energy.

Ethanol production as a tool for sustainable development.

Sheinbaum's request to strengthen Brazil-Mexico cooperation aims to expand local ethanol production and meet Mexico's growing domestic demand.

Biofuel is seen as a viable alternative to reduce carbon emissions and offer new economic opportunities to rural producers.

With the experience accumulated over four decades of flex-fuel automotive production and technology, Brazil emerges as a natural partner in this process.

Brazilian ethanol, internationally recognized for its energy efficiency, will serve as a basis for technology transfers and incentive programs in the neighboring country.

The exchange should include studies on agricultural productivity, soil quality, and the rational use of water.

Energy diplomacy and regional integration

The conversation between Lula and Sheinbaum reinforced not only the economic character, but also the geopolitical role of Brazil-Mexico cooperation.

Both governments consider energy integration to be fundamental to strengthening Latin America's autonomy amidst the global transition to clean energy sources.

The dialogue also addressed climate commitments and joint participation in COP30, which will be held in Belém.

Mexico will designate Minister Alicia Barcenas as its official representative at the event, while Lula reaffirmed his interest in consolidating multilateral agreements that position the continent as a protagonist in the environmental agenda.

Expectations and next steps for the partnership.

Mexican Foreign Minister Juan Ramón de La Fuente Ramírez will visit Brazil at the end of November to continue negotiations.

The expectation is to establish a new trade agreement that deepens the exchange of green technologies and boosts cooperation in industrial policies related to ethanol and decarbonization.

For the Brazilian government, this partnership represents an opportunity to project internationally the biofuel model that the country has mastered for decades.

Brazil-Mexico cooperation therefore symbolizes a joint commitment to sustainable energy solutions capable of generating growth. reduce inequalities and prepare the region for a low-carbon economy.",https://clickpetroleoegas.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Lula-e-Sheinbaum-reforcam-a-cooperacao-Brasil-Mexico-para-impulsionar-a-producao-de-etanol-ampliando-acordos-e-parcerias-energeticas-sustentaveis.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 07:56:35.110812

A new Biocrude Upgrading process technology has been introduced that converts agricultural and forestry waste into ready-to-use renewable fuels, including Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and marine fuel. This development fundamentally changes the economics of the sustainable fuel supply chain by unlocking inexpensive, abundant, non-food biomass feedstocks that were previously difficult to process. The technology is delivered in a prefabricated modular plant, which allows the initial conversion of waste to biocrude to happen directly at the feedstock collection sites, keeping transport costs low and accelerating project timelines. The resulting fuels are drop-in replacements with higher energy density than many current biofuel alternatives.

Analysis

This breakthrough is caused by a new Biocrude Upgrading process that efficiently converts complex lignocellulosic biomass into a stable, refinery-ready intermediate biocrude. The core dynamic is decentralization: instead of shipping bulky waste to a central plant, the modular unit performs the initial, volume-reducing conversion at the source. Manufacturers are expected to react by aggressively pursuing new projects, as the modular design reduces capital risk and simplifies construction.

Think of the modular plant like a decentralized pre-refinery: it converts low-value, high-volume waste into a high-value, low-volume liquid that is cheap to ship and easy to refine. This shifts the economic bottleneck from logistics to technology deployment.

Outlook

This technology implies a significant acceleration in the development of waste-to-fuel industrial clusters, particularly in regions with large forestry and agricultural sectors. The next simple thing to look for is the announcement of Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) for the first commercial-scale modular plants and new long-term offtake agreements from major airlines or shipping companies. These agreements will signal that the market trusts the new feedstock pathway and is ready to commit capital based on the promise of lower, more stable production costs.",https://news.sustainability-directory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Eucalyptus-Gum-Nut-Development-Highlighting-Plant-Reproductive-Biology-for-Sustainable-Forestry-and-Biodiversity-Conservation.jpeg,N,,2025-11-02 11:16:35.111804

Moreover, aviation and maritime shipping share a common challenge to decarbonization – they carry extremely heavy loads and have very limited opportunities for refuelling.
The result is a more sustainable alternative to marine fuel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and gasoline.
“Honeywell continues to drive innovation in the areas that our customers need most,” Ken West, president of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, was quoted by Interesting Engineering.
The Trump administration got off to a rocky start in this regard, and only time will tell how future fuel standards and trade policies will unfold.","Shipping and aviation are considered to be some of the hardest to abate sectors when it comes to decarbonization. Together, these two sectors account for a whopping 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and that figure is likely going to rise as more goods are shipped and more flights are booked each and every year. But a new biofuels breakthrough may provide a long-range fuel alternative for the heavy transport and aviation industries.

Emissions from the aviation sector have quadrupled since the 1960s, even as flying has become more than twice as energy efficient. And as incomes rise around the world and more and more people fly, emissions will continue to climb. Today, just 10% of the global population uses air travel, but that’s set to change in the near future as global economies continue to develop.

Maritime shipping, meanwhile, remains reliant on heavy fuel oil, also known as bunker oil, the second dirtiest fossil fuel in the world after coal. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, if the maritime shipping industry was a country, it would rank as the sixth-highest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world.

Moreover, aviation and maritime shipping share a common challenge to decarbonization – they carry extremely heavy loads and have very limited opportunities for refuelling. As a result, they need fuels that are extremely energy dense. As a result, “the energy density of oil-based fuels is particularly important in these sectors,” according to Barron’s.

Until now, biomass has not been a feasible option for its replacement, as “the supply of waste oil feedstock is not sufficient to meet demand.” However, Barron’s noted in its 2020 report that “biofuels from cellulosic crops and agricultural wastes are possibilities for the future.”

Well, the future is now. Honeywell, a conglomerate corporation headquartered in the United States, has unveiled a new system that can reportedly convert biomass into ready-to-use renewable fuels. The novel Biocrude Upgrading process technology is designed to run on byproducts from agriculture and forestry to divert waste into a cheap and abundant source of biomass. The result is a more sustainable alternative to marine fuel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and gasoline.

“With higher energy density than many current biofuel alternatives, this renewable marine fuel can extend a vessel’s range without requiring costly engine upgrades,” Honeywell said in a press release posted earlier this week.

The ability to pivot to biofuels without changing engine infrastructure is a critical selling point of the new product. Plus, Honeywell is sweetening the deal by reducing risk and streamlining deployment of the new technology through prefabricated modular plants. One of the things that makes shipping and aviation so hard to abate is that the infrastructure and investments that uphold the sector are “locked into high-carbon pathways for decades.” As such, alternative fuel sources, including biofuels, are needed “for disruption to break through carbon lock-in and path dependency” according to a paper published in the scientific journal Environmental Innovation and Societal Transitions in September of last year.

Making a biofuel that is easy to use and cost-effective is therefore critical to creating disruption and driving real change in the shipping and aviation industries. “Honeywell continues to drive innovation in the areas that our customers need most,” Ken West, president of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, was quoted by Interesting Engineering. “The maritime industry has a real need for renewable fuels that are immediately available and cost-effective. Our Biocrude Upgrading processing technology can be delivered in modular form, offering savings from the point of installation through to refining and use.”

The biofuels industry is coming off of several boom years in a row, but there is some concern that policy changes could put a damper on the sector. Continued free trade with Canada will be critical to the success of an endeavor like the Biocrude Updating technology, as the country is a critical source of feedstock from its agricultural and forestry sectors. The Trump administration got off to a rocky start in this regard, and only time will tell how future fuel standards and trade policies will unfold.

With the introduction of SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) mandates under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, EU airlines are required to mix conventional jet fuel with sustainable alternatives. This bold step will not only significantly reduce carbon emissions but also foster a new era of green tourism, benefiting travelers and local economies across Europe.

The ReFuelEU Aviation regulation is setting clear, progressive targets. By 2025, airlines will be required to use at least 2% SAF in their fuel blend, with the percentage rising to 6% by 2030. Looking further ahead, the European Commission aims for 70% SAF use by 2050. This ambitious plan marks a crucial milestone in Europe’s journey to decarbonize aviation and aligns with its broader climate goals.

The Mandate and Its Implication

Europe’s drive to integrate SAF into aviation fuel is not just about reducing emissions—it’s about setting a global standard. The ReFuelEU mandate creates a clear demand for SAF, encouraging investment in sustainable fuel production. With the aviation industry currently accounting for about 2-3% of global CO₂ emissions, the shift to SAF is seen as a game-changer.

However, challenges persist. The cost of SAF remains a barrier. The European Union’s cost projections show that conventional jet fuel costs around €816 per tonne, while biofuels (including SAF) cost approximately €2,768 per tonne. Synthetic SAF, or e-fuel, can cost up to €7,500 per tonne. This price disparity could increase the cost of travel for consumers, but it also presents an opportunity for sustainable tourism development in the long run.

For tourists, these price increases could be offset by an enhanced sense of responsibility and eco-conscious travel. Many travelers are increasingly seeking destinations that prioritize sustainability and environmental conservation. Europe’s leadership in this area positions it as a global tourism hub for the environmentally aware traveler.

The Role of Innovation in Achieving SAF Goals

Innovation is key to meeting the European Union’s SAF goals. While the most widely used SAF production pathway today is HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids), which uses waste oils and fats, there are several other emerging technologies. These include Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ), Fischer-Tropsch from biomass, and solar-to-liquid processes, all of which have the potential to revolutionize the industry.

The article mentions that Europe’s support for innovative SAF pathways will boost both production capacity and technological development. This aligns with the European Green Deal’s broader vision of reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050. For travelers, this means that soon, flying will not only be more sustainable but also more affordable as production scales up.

Tourism and Economic Growth: A Greener Future

For Europe’s tourism industry, the transition to SAF could provide a significant boost. As the tourism sector becomes more conscious of its carbon footprint, travelers will increasingly gravitate toward destinations and airlines that adopt greener technologies. The introduction of SAF mandates offers European tourism an opportunity to market itself as a leader in sustainability.

In addition, European airports could benefit from the SAF revolution, which may create new jobs and infrastructure to handle SAF production and storage. Local economies will experience a boost as more eco-conscious travelers flock to green destinations that promote low-emission travel options. Airlines offering SAF-blended flights could market these offerings as environmentally friendly travel choices, giving them an edge in the competitive tourism market.

The Challenges Ahead for Europe’s SAF Transition

Despite the promising outlook, there are several challenges to overcome. Feedstock availability, high capital expenditures for SAF facilities, and the scalability of production remain major obstacles. Many SAF production plants are still in the “pre-commercial” phase, meaning they have not yet reached full-scale production.

The aviation sector, along with industry groups, has expressed concerns about the fairness of the mandates, particularly in regions where SAF production is still limited. However, Europe is committed to overcoming these hurdles by encouraging further investment and collaboration with private sector innovators.

For the travel sector, this means that while SAF adoption may lead to temporary increases in costs, it also signals a long-term shift towards cleaner, greener aviation. As the supply chain matures and production increases, costs are expected to fall, making SAF a viable and accessible fuel option for airlines across Europe.

A Greener Future for European Tourism

Europe’s push for SAF adoption is a pivotal step toward a more sustainable and resilient aviation industry. With the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, Europe is not only reducing emissions but is also leading the charge toward a greener tourism future. As the tourism sector continues to recover post-pandemic, green travel initiatives like SAF will play a key role in attracting eco-conscious tourists and supporting local economies.

By 2050, the goal is for 70% of jet fuel used in European airports to come from sustainable sources. While the challenges are significant, the benefits for both the aviation industry and tourism are undeniable. Tourists will soon be able to experience the beauty of Europe with the peace of mind that their travel is contributing to a greener planet.

The key driver? Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF is a biofuel made from renewable resources that reduces carbon emissions and is integral to achieving Europe’s ambitious carbon-neutral goals. With recent regulations, such as the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate, the aviation industry is witnessing a transformative shift in fuel consumption.

What Are SAF Mandates?

Since January 2025, European airports have been mandated to blend a minimum of 2% SAF with conventional jet fuel. This percentage will increase incrementally, reaching 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. These regulations are part of the European Union’s broader strategy to decarbonize the aviation sector. ReFuelEU Aviation, an EU regulation first drafted in 2021, aims to make SAF the primary fuel for aircraft departing from European airports, bolstering sustainable aviation while fostering innovation and growth in the biofuel sector.

The Role of SAF in Decarbonization

The EU’s SAF mandate plays a critical role in achieving the aviation industry’s carbon neutrality by 2050. Aviation contributes significantly to global emissions, and while carbon offsetting strategies exist, SAF provides a tangible solution for reducing aviation’s carbon footprint. As SAF production scales, its environmental benefits will only increase, reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and helping meet global climate goals.

Challenges to SAF Production and the Need for Investment

Despite the positive impact of SAF, production in Europe is not without its hurdles. SAF is still in its early stages of development, and Europe’s capacity to produce it is far from meeting the growing demand. The cost of SAF production is high, and regulatory uncertainty remains. While countries like the US have provided financial incentives to encourage SAF production, Europe’s reliance on regulatory measures, like the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, falls short in addressing the upfront investment challenges faced by SAF producers.

Europe’s SAF Supply Chain Needs Strengthening

The current SAF supply chain in Europe is still underdeveloped. While demand is increasing, the supply remains limited, creating an imbalance in the market. Europe’s refineries are adapting to produce SAF, but with geopolitical challenges and concerns about feedstock supply chains, such as the reliance on used cooking oil, the region faces risks that may hinder long-term sustainability. To address these challenges, policymakers must focus on strengthening the SAF supply chain through incentives, clearer legislative frameworks, and better financial backing.

Aviation Leaders Push for Clearer Legislation

The aviation industry is committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but experts argue that more coordinated financial support is needed. Business aviation manufacturers and industry stakeholders have urged the EU to simplify regulations and provide stronger financial incentives. According to Kyle Martin, VP of European affairs at the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), a shift in focus towards innovation and competitiveness, rather than solely sustainability, is vital for achieving both goals.

At the same time, European authorities have expressed caution about the pace of SAF development. In February 2025, the Airports Council International (ACI) Europe warned that further EU support was necessary to meet the ambitious targets set for 2050. The alliance called for a more comprehensive SAF industrial policy, increased financing, and a reduction in the regulatory burden.

The Future of SAF in Europe: Power-to-Liquid (PtL) and Next-Generation Fuels

As Europe looks to expand its SAF production capabilities, next-generation fuels are gaining attention. Power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels, produced using green hydrogen and carbon feedstocks, offer a promising alternative to current SAF pathways. Europe is exploring these innovative solutions as part of its commitment to reducing reliance on traditional fossil fuels. While PtL fuels hold significant potential, they are still in the pilot phase, and scaling up production will require substantial investment and technological advancements.

Opportunities for Travelers: A Greener Way to Fly

For global travelers, the shift towards SAF means cleaner air travel options in the future. Major airports in Europe, including Paris Le Bourget, London Luton, and London Farnborough, are leading the way in SAF adoption. As demand grows, airports and airlines are working to ensure SAF availability for passengers. This transition not only benefits the environment but also aligns with travelers’ increasing desire for sustainable travel options.

By supporting the adoption of SAF, travelers can contribute to a greener aviation industry while enjoying the benefits of cleaner, more sustainable flights. As Europe’s aviation industry navigates these challenges and opportunities, the future of air travel looks brighter and more eco-friendly than ever.

Conclusion: Europe’s Bold Steps Towards a Sustainable Aviation Future

Europe’s commitment to sustainable aviation through SAF mandates is a significant step in the fight against climate change. While challenges remain in scaling production, the EU’s proactive approach is setting the stage for a greener future. By prioritizing SAF, Europe is not only reducing aviation emissions but also paving the way for a global shift towards sustainable travel.

With commercial aviation contributing an increasing share of global greenhouse gas emissions due to growing demand for air travel, sustainable fuel alternatives are seen as crucial for decarbonizing the sector, reported by Newsweek.

Yuanhui Zhang, a professor of agricultural and biological engineering at the university, explained that their research addresses both scientific and engineering challenges and allows the industry to take next steps.

He also stated that this technology could be applied to other types of oils to produce SAF and could even replace petroleum-based compounds used in plastics.

He described this discovery as having great potential for business opportunities and economic development.

The researcher's technology is based on hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), a thermochemical process that converts organic waste into crude oil. This ""biocrude"" is then purified and refined using hydrogen and catalysts, removing elements like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulphur to produce jet fuel, reported by Newsweek.

For the study, the team used waste from a nearby food processing plant. Every year more than 30 percent of food production worldwide is wasted, from farms, transportation, stores, and homes. When this waste ends up in landfills or water treatment systems, it emits greenhouse gases upon decomposition. Converting it into jet fuel reduces these emissions and recycles materials that would otherwise contribute to climate change.

The HTL process isn't limited to food waste; it can use a variety of feedstocks. According to the researchers, the process mimics the natural geological conditions under which fossil fuels form, compressing wet biomass under high temperature and pressure to produce biocrude.

The team's final SAF product successfully passed Tier Alpha and Beta pre-screening tests set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration and meets all standards for use in aircraft engines without any admixtures.

When discussing the versatility of their biocrude jet fuel, the team noted that the ability to use food waste as a fuel source is critical, since over 30% of the world’s food is wasted every year “at all levels” of the supply chain.
Although the food waste for experiments came from a nearby food processing facility, Summers’ team said that the HTL process can be applied to other organic waste products.
This fills a missing link in the circular paradigm.” The paper, “From food waste to sustainable aviation fuel: cobalt molybdenum catalysis of pretreated hydrothermal liquefaction biocrude,” was published in Nature Communications.","Researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (U of I) have successfully converted food waste into a form of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that they say meets industry standards without relying on fossil fuel blends.

The team suggests that their approach, which helps reduce dependence on fossil fuels for aviation applications and redirects otherwise discarded food waste from landfills where it generates more greenhouse gases, could help the aviation industry meet its “ambitious” goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

According to a statement detailing the innovative approach, the researchers utilized a process called hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), which employed a thermochemical reaction to convert ordinary food waste into a basic biocrude oil. This process is similar to how natural processes create crude oil, which is used to make a wide range of products, including automotive and aviation fuels.

“HTL basically mimics the natural formation of crude oil in the Earth,” explained the study’s lead author, Sabrina Summers, from the U of I. “It uses high heat and pressure to convert wet biomass into a biocrude oil.”

Summers, who recently graduated with a doctoral degree from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE), part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences and The Grainger College of Engineering at U. of I, said the goal of their research was to upgrade the biocrude oil generated during the HTL process into transportation fuels “that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure.”

The first step in the team’s process involved removing impurities from the biocrude oil. These unwanted contaminants included things like moisture, salt, and ash. Next, Summers and colleagues employed another process, called catalytic hydrotreating, to remove additional unwanted components of the biocrude oil, such as sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. The team stated that upon completion of these steps, the remaining biocrude was almost entirely composed of the hydrocarbons required to produce jet fuel.

The final step to make viable SAF involved catalyzing the hydrocarbons. According to the team’s statement, they tested several options before settling on cobalt molybdenum as the “most effective” catalyst to drive the needed chemical reactions. During the hydrotreatment portion, the research team also fine-tuned the catalyst and hydrogen loads, temperature, and overall retention time until they achieved the optimal conditions for producing the desired fuel.

Once the conversion process was completed, the team said they tested their final batch of SAF against the “rigorous standards” for quality and purity set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration. As hoped, the team said their sample passed “Tier Alpha and Beta prescreening tests” and successfully met “all specifications for conventional jet fuel.” Notably, the team said their fuel met these standards without the need for any additives or blending with fossil fuels.

When discussing the versatility of their biocrude jet fuel, the team noted that the ability to use food waste as a fuel source is critical, since over 30% of the world’s food is wasted every year “at all levels” of the supply chain. Although the food waste for experiments came from a nearby food processing facility, Summers’ team said that the HTL process can be applied to other organic waste products. These include otherwise discarded materials, such as biowaste, algal blooms, sewage sludge, swine manure from farming, and other forms of agricultural residue that are high in base hydrocarbons.

“To meet the aviation industry’s goals to decarbonize jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,” explained ABE professor and the study’s corresponding author, Yuanhui Zhang.

When discussing the potential applications of their research, Zhang noted that their work has helped solve the scientific and engineering problems associated with converting food waste into usable jet fuel, and it is now time for industry to “step in.”

“The process can be applied to other types of oils for SAF,” he explained. “It can also replace other materials, such as petroleum-derived compounds, for making plastics. This has huge potential for business opportunities and economic development.”

To highlight potential areas that could benefit from this type of biocrude-to-jet-fuel process, Zhang developed an index to measure circular bioeconomy, in which he said SAFs provide a valuable contribution to circularity.

“In a linear economy, we just produce something, use it, and throw it away,” he explained. “In this project, we take the waste and recover the energy and materials to make a usable product. This fills a missing link in the circular paradigm.”

On October 27, Francesco La Camera, director-general of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), called for the upcoming COP summit to adopt a global target to quadruple the production and use of sustainable fuels by 2035. He said the goal should be clearly reflected in the conference’s final declaration.

The proposal builds on recent analysis by the International Energy Agency (IEA), which estimates that global output of biofuels and synthetic fuels could reach 28 exajoules by 2035, four times today’s levels, if existing policies are fully implemented. Currently, sustainable fuels account for only 1.3 percent of global energy consumption, with nearly 80 percent derived from liquid biofuels.

Currently, sustainable fuels account for only 1.3 percent of global energy consumption, with nearly 80 percent derived from liquid biofuels.

According to the IEA, these fuels have already helped cut global oil demand by 2.5 million barrels per day in 2024. They are also seen as one of the few practical options to decarbonize sectors that are hard to electrify, such as aviation, shipping, and heavy industry, while reducing countries’ reliance on imported fossil fuels.

Brazil, host of the upcoming COP and the world’s largest bioethanol producer, intends to make the summit a launchpad for an international coalition on sustainable fuels.

High costs remain a hurdle

Despite their potential, sustainable fuels still face major economic obstacles. The IEA estimates that biofuels currently cost 2.7 to 3.8 times more than conventional fossil fuels.

Even so, the impact on consumers would be limited, given the small blending ratios and the relatively low share of energy costs in final goods. Incorporating 15 percent of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) into jet fuel, for instance, would raise ticket prices by only 5 to 7 percent, according to the agency.

The agency recommends bold policy measures combining production incentives with the integration of biofuels into carbon markets.

Meeting global production targets will also require massive investment, about $1.5 trillion between 2024 and 2035 under the IEA’s accelerated scenario. The agency recommends bold policy measures combining production incentives with the integration of biofuels into carbon markets.

Yet market signals remain mixed. Shell and BP recently scrapped bioenergy projects in Rotterdam, citing unfavorable economic conditions. For IRENA, such setbacks highlight the need for stable, coordinated international policies to attract capital and build investor confidence.

If governments can agree on a shared pathway and create supportive market conditions, biofuels could become a cornerstone of the global energy transition in hard-to-abate sectors. Without binding commitments, however, IRENA warns that the promise of sustainable fuels risks remaining symbolic.

La Camera said he hopes COP30 will mark the moment when biofuels move from rhetoric to action, driving a transition that blends technological progress with social equity.",https://www.ecofinagency.com/media/k2/items/cache/3d73084984522720ff642af4fe747b0b_S.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 13:16:35.502128

Strange as it might sound, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign believe that they’ve figured out a process to make that unlikely scenario a reality–at least on a small scale.

Writing this week in Nature Communications, the agricultural engineers outlined a strategy for taking excess food waste, converting it into biofuel, and then “upgrading” that fuel into jet fuel that can go straight into a plane without requiring additional changes to the aircraft’s infrastructure. They compared their food-waste-derived fuel against industry benchmarks and found that it met all the necessary standards for conventional jet fuel.

Though these findings are still more of a proof of concept, they open up the exciting possibility of using food waste (which there’s certainly no shortage of) to help the aviation industry move closer to its ambitious goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions within the next three decades.

“In a linear economy, we just produce something, use it, and throw it away. In this project, we take the waste and recover the energy and materials to make a usable product. This fills a missing link in the circular paradigm,” University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang said in a statement.

Planes lag behind cars in emission reductions

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that transportation accounted for roughly 29 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in 2022 alone. Of that, about seven percent came from commercial aircraft. Modern cars have reduced emissions in recent years, in part thanks to the shift toward electric battery power. And while battery-powered airplanes are theoretically possible for some short flights, they simply don’t provide enough energy to power a passenger jet traveling across the country(jet fuel carries around 50 times more energy per kilogram than conventional lithium-ion batteries. As a result, jets have lagged behind cars in reducing emissions.

But what about so-called biomass-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)? Some estimates suggest that SAF, which largely refers to fuels derived from organic materials, could reduce emissions from flying by up to 80 percent, compared to conventional jet fuel. While ethanol and other biomass-based derivatives have been available for cars for decades, they have remained more elusive for airplanes because their chemical composition does not meet the much stricter requirements necessary for jet fuel.

Upgrading biomass to jet fuel

Meeting these requirements is where food waste comes in. In this new experiment, the team started by collecting food waste from nearby food-processing plants. They then used a chemical process called hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), which essentially mimics the way the Earth naturally creates crude oil from organic matter over millions of years, except without all the waiting. HTL kind of acts like an advanced “pressure cooker” to fast-forward nature’s timeline.

With plenty of crude oil extracted from the food scraps, the researchers then set out to convert it into jet fuel through a two-part process. The first step involved removing salt, ash, moisture, and other impurities. After that, they used a cleaning process called catalytic hydrotreating to eliminate other undesirable elements such as nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen. What remained were the specific hydrocarbons required to make jet fuel. They tested different catalysts and found that cobalt–molybdenum stood out as the most effective and commercially available metallic catalyst for driving the chemical reactions needed to refine the oil into aviation fuel.

The team took their food-waste derived aviation fuels and tested it against current fuel standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration. It passed the screening test and met industry requirements without needing to introduce any special additives. That means, the fuel would theoretically power a commercial airplane.

The findings are a first step to show aviation fuel derived from food waste is at least possible. Actually making enough of it to supply an entire passenger jet, however, is another beast altogether. Scaling up at this level requires time, resources, and deep pocket books outside of academia.

(AP) — A multi-state carbon capture pipeline began operating in September, reducing emissions from Midwest ethanol plants and carrying that carbon dioxide gas to be forever buried underground in Wyoming - an achievement after years of complaints, lawsuits and legislation blocked similar efforts by other companies.

Other projects prompted intense opposition, including one that has run up $1 billion in spending with no guarantee of success, but the Tallgrass Trailblazer Pipeline is being praised. The reason: community negotiations and financial support.

“I wish all energy companies would treat communities with a lot more respect like Tallgrass did,” said Jane Kleeb, whose group Bold Nebraska has fought other carbon capture and oil pipelines.

The Tallgrass pipeline has started moving emissions from 11 ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa to a site in southeast Wyoming, where the greenhouse gas will be buried 9,000 feet underground.

The fermentation process to convert corn into fuel releases carbon dioxide. By capturing it before it’s released into the air, plants can lower their carbon intensity score, making the ethanol more attractive for refinement into so-called sustainable aviation fuel - a market some believe could climb to 50 billion gallons annually. The Midwest-based ethanol industry sees jet fuel as essential to its future, offsetting expected declines in demand for motor vehicle fuel as more drivers switch to electric vehicles.

The federal government encourages carbon capture through lucrative tax credits to pipeline operators. The Biden administration wanted to encourage a practice that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the Trump administration has let the credits continue.

“If an ethanol plant captures the carbon, it lowers their carbon index and they become a low-carbon fuel, and there’s a premium for that,” said Tom Buis, CEO of the American Carbon Alliance, a trade group. “And they can also produce sustainable aviation fuel out of it. Sustainable aviation fuel is a huge, gigantic market just waiting for someone to step forward and take it.”

At least three other companies have proposed carbon capture pipelines in the Midwest, but aside from Tallgrass, only Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions is persisting - and it hasn’t been easy.

Summit has proposed a multibillion-dollar, five-state pipeline network encompassing dozens of ethanol plants, thousands of miles and underground storage in North Dakota.

Despite strong support from agricultural groups and the ethanol industry, Summit has dealt with persistent opponents who don’t want their land taken for the pipeline and fear a hazardous pipe rupture. Landowners sued to block the pipeline and sought help from legislators. South Dakota’s legislature banned the use of eminent domain for such lines.

In response Summit has asked Iowa regulators to amend its permit so the company retains an option for a route that would avoid South Dakota.

“Our focus remains on supporting as many ethanol partners as possible and building a strong foundation that helps farmers, ethanol plants, and rural communities access the markets they’ll depend on for decades to come,” Summit said in a statement.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency oversees a rigorous process for underground carbon dioxide injection, involving permits for construction and injection and regulations to protect underground sources of drinking water, Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark said. Typically, porous rock formations similar to a sponge will store or trap the carbon dioxide more than a mile underground, she said.

Tallgrass had one big advantage at the starting point - it converted an existing natural gas line. The natural gas was put on a different pipeline as Trailblazer was retrofitted. The company built branches off the 400-mile mainline to connect to ethanol plants.

But Tallgrass also took pains to engage with communities along its route.

The company worked with people to get its project done “instead of trying to push it down our throat,” said Lee Hogan, chairman of the Adams County commission in Nebraska, whose home is a half-mile from the pipeline.

It helped that Tallgrass worked with Bold Nebraska, a citizens group, to create a community investment fund that will make annual payments to organizations related to early childhood development, Medicaid-eligible senior care and food pantries.

Tallgrass will make an initial $500,000 contribution followed by annual payments based on 10 cents per metric ton of carbon dioxide sent through the pipeline. The Nebraska Community Foundation, which will manage the fund, expects more than $7 million will be given out through 2035 across 31 counties in four states.

It’s a unique arrangement, and a possible template for future projects, said Nebraska Community Foundation leader Jeff Yost.

“I’m just really impressed that folks that could have just approached this purely as opponents have come together to find a really productive middle ground,” Yost said.

Tallgrass spokesman Steven Davidson said the investment fund is just one piece of the company’s agreement with Bold, which he said emphasizes being cooperative and transparent, such as when surveying land and valuing easements.

While lauding Tallgrass’ cooperative approach, Jack Andreasen Cavanaugh, who studies energy policy at Columbia University, said it may be hard to replicate the experience since few if any natural gas pipelines will be available for retrofitting, given increases in supply and demand for natural gas domestically and abroad. Tallgrass’ line crosses his family’s land in Nebraska.

Still, companies can do better to engage and negotiate with communities, and that includes spending money, he said.

Kyle Quackenbush, a Tallgrass vice president, said his advice to other pipeline companies is to listen.

(AP) — A multi-state carbon capture pipeline began operating in September, reducing emissions from Midwest ethanol plants and carrying that carbon dioxide gas to be forever buried underground in Wyoming — an achievement after years of complaints, lawsuits and legislation blocked similar efforts by other companies.

Other projects prompted intense opposition, including one that has run up $1 billion in spending with no guarantee of success, but the Tallgrass Trailblazer Pipeline is being praised. The reason: community negotiations and financial support.

“I wish all energy companies would treat communities with a lot more respect like Tallgrass did,” said Jane Kleeb, whose group Bold Nebraska has fought other carbon capture and oil pipelines.

Carbon capture pipelines

The Tallgrass pipeline has started moving emissions from 11 ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa to a site in southeast Wyoming, where the greenhouse gas will be buried 9,000 feet underground.

The fermentation process to convert corn into fuel releases carbon dioxide. By capturing it before it's released into the air, plants can lower their carbon intensity score, making the ethanol more attractive for refinement into so-called sustainable aviation fuel — a market some believe could climb to 50 billion gallons annually. The Midwest-based ethanol industry sees jet fuel as essential to its future, offsetting expected declines in demand for motor vehicle fuel as more drivers switch to electric vehicles.

The federal government encourages carbon capture through lucrative tax credits to pipeline operators. The Biden administration wanted to encourage a practice that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the Trump administration has let the credits continue.

Results of the Third Quarter It was the strongest quarter in terms of revenue in the history of the Lufthansa Group.
Operating profit for the first nine months amounted to 1.5 billion euros, up 300 million euros on the previous year.
Carsten Spohr, the CEO of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, described the results as a “positive turning point” for the Lufthansa.
This had the positive effect of reducing the financial burden resulting from flight irregularities by more than 200 million euros.","The Lufthansa Group has reported another robust third quarter in operating profits as it’s increased its revenue by 4% year-on-year to 11.2 billion euros (last year was 10.7 billion euros). The Lufthansa Group reaffirmed its outlook of anticipating a significant increase in earnings for the year as a whole.

Results of the Third Quarter

It was the strongest quarter in terms of revenue in the history of the Lufthansa Group. The company generated an operating profit (adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT) of 1.3 billion euros, which was similar to the previous year.

The operating margin for this period was 11.9%, lower than the previous year that was at 12.5%. Operating profit for the first nine months amounted to 1.5 billion euros, up 300 million euros on the previous year.

Carsten Spohr, the CEO of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, described the results as a “positive turning point” for the Lufthansa.

“We have had the best summer in terms of our flight operations in the last decade – with regularity of over 99 percent and a double-digit improvement in punctuality […] In combination with numerous digital innovations, upgraded services, and newly designed lounges, passenger satisfaction rose significantly in the third quarter. With employee satisfaction also reaching new highs across the Group […].”

Spohr also noted concerns about Germany’s competitive position as a business hub, saying,

“Germany as a location for business is benefiting less and less from our success, as shown by the fact that domestic flights within Germany have halved since 2019 due to regulatory cost developments.”

Improved Results in the First Nine Months

In the third quarter, the Lufthansa Group welcomed around 42 million passengers on board its passenger airlines, up from 40 million last year. Despite a 3% increase in seat capacity, load factor rose in the third quarter slightly to 87.5%.

Overall revenue for the passenger airlines grew slightly to 8.9 million euros in the third quarter, generating an operating profit of 1.2 billion euros.

For the first nine months of 2025, passenger airline revenue totalled 23 billion euros, 3% growth compared with the previous year. Adjusted EBIT improved by roughly 10% from the last year to 914 million euros.

There were some key factors for this positive development such as lower fuel cost, improved result from equity investments and the absence of the financial impact of strikes in 2024.

In addition, the Lufthansa Group also recorded an improvement in punctuality by 10% compared to last year, through the stabilisation of flight operations in the first nine months. This had the positive effect of reducing the financial burden resulting from flight irregularities by more than 200 million euros.

Employee satisfaction and outlook

The Lufthansa Group saw an improvement in employee satisfaction in its annual employee ‘involve me!’ survey, that showed the highest engagement levels within the last decade since it began. The engagement index scored an average value of 3.9 out of 5, as compared to last year, the survey recorded a 2.2 out of 5 score.

The outlook for the fourth quarter seems to indicate a more stable demand from the number of advance bookings. The current booking status for Lufthansa is on par with 2024.

With ongoing global uncertainties, the Lufthansa Group remain optimistic and confirmed its forecast for the full year and expects an operating result (adjusted EBIT) to be significantly above the previous year.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Lufthansa_Airbus_A320-214_D-AIZL_MUC_2015_01.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 13:00:36.761939

In its formal comments submitted to the EPA, the organization warned that failure to act could cost U.S. soybean farmers between $3.2 billion and $7.5 billion in crop value over the next two years, citing estimates from the World Agricultural and Economic Environmental Services (WAEES) model, reports Iowabiodiesel.org.

Grant Kimberley, Executive Director of the Iowa Biodiesel Board, said that biomass-based diesel contributes about 10 percent of the value of each bushel of soybeans grown in the U.S., adding that this support is critical as farmers face record yields amid uncertain global markets.

The IBB’s comments also highlighted the vulnerability of Iowa’s independent biodiesel producers, who lack the financial strength of larger companies to cope with extended periods of policy uncertainty. Kimberley warned that losing these producers would be a major setback for the renewable fuels industry, eliminating years of investment and removing key local markets for Iowa’s farmers at a time when they can least afford it.

The organization urged the EPA to reallocate all small refinery exemptions for 2023 through 2027, finalize Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) before the next compliance year begins, and maintain strong volume targets to ensure stability for farmers and producers.

IBB expressed appreciation for the EPA’s recognition of the expanding production capacity and feedstock investments driving growth in U.S.-made biodiesel, renewable diesel, and sustainable aviation fuel. However, the group stressed that delays in finalizing the rule leave the biomass-based diesel sector uncertain and unable to plan future investments. Kimberley noted that Iowa farmers are already preparing for the next planting season and need clarity to make informed decisions.

According to a national study commissioned by Clean Fuels Alliance America, Iowa’s biodiesel industry supports 12,000 jobs and generates $3.5 billion in economic activity each year.

The Apec AI Initiative is another step in the right direction, he said.","– As artificial intelligence (AI) evolves, governments must invest more in preparing their workers and cannot leave it to the market, said Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.

Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) economies can lead these efforts by reskilling and upskilling workers, redesigning jobs, and building trust in AI, so they are not caught on the backfoot, PM Wong said on Nov 1.

“By doing so, we can ensure that the returns from AI investments will accrue not just to the owners of capital, but also to workers, and importantly to all our people,” he said to leaders of the 21 economies around the Pacific Rim which make up the grouping.

Singapore’s focus is on the application and use of AI, he said.

As a small, compact and digitally connected city state, it cannot on its own develop leading-edge AI foundation models. But it can use them to develop and make applications with the “biggest impact” in areas like finance, logistics, healthcare and advanced manufacturing, PM Wong said.

Singapore cannot do this work alone, and is keen to cooperate and exchange best practices with other Apec economies, he added.

In a session themed Preparing For A Future-ready Asia-Pacific, PM Wong said that AI will drive the next wave of growth.

“It will uplift productivity, and transform the way we work and live,” he added, as he laid out ways to spearhead cooperation in harnessing the technology.

AI is already transforming industries in Singapore, he said on the second day of the Apec Economic Leaders’ Meeting, the highest-level meeting at the annual summit which is running from Oct 31 to Nov 1 in Gyeongju, South Korea.

Outlining what needs to be done to unlock the technology’s potential, PM Wong said Apec economies must build up the capabilities of their workforces and prepare workers.

With every new wave of technology, some jobs will disappear and new jobs will be created, and historically, the net impact has been positive – meaning more net jobs have been created.

But there is no economic law that guarantees this will automatically happen, PM Wong said.

“Just because it happened in the past doesn’t mean it will also happen in the future. We cannot leave this to the market.”

Apec economies also need to build trust in AI, he said.

That is why Singapore is playing an active role in global efforts to advance AI standards – so that there is an overall framework for innovation and users know that they are using responsibly developed systems, he added.

To do so, Singapore has set up the AI Verify Foundation to set such standards in partnership with the private sector. It now has more than 170 members including companies like Hitachi, Google and OpenAI, he noted.

The foundation was set up in 2023 to boost AI testing capabilities and assurance to meet the needs of companies and regulators globally.

Earlier in 2025, Singapore also convened leading experts to formulate the Singapore Consensus on Global AI Safety Research Priorities, a document aligning views on the development, assessment, and control of AI, he noted.

PM Wong also urged Apec economies to keep data corridors open, because data is what powers AI models.

Singapore supports the Apec Cross-Border Privacy Rules System, which facilitates the free flow of data with trust, in order to promote AI innovation, he said.

Trade pacts like

the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement

– which Singapore, Chile and New Zealand signed in 2020 – can also enable data flows.

On how Apec can take the lead on these efforts, PM Wong said the member economies have AI expertise and experience.

He commended 2025’s Apec summit host South Korea for convening the first Apec Digital and AI Ministerial Meeting.

The Apec AI Initiative is another step in the right direction, he said. It will promote greater cooperation on AI through policy exchanges and capacity-building projects, and foster investments in AI infrastructure.

“Singapore looks forward to working with Apec economies to ensure that our societies benefit from AI,” he said. “Together, we can put AI to work on the problems that matter most, so our people can prosper together.”

The informed professional has been wondering how the aviation and maritime industries can meet aggressive net-zero mandates when Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and renewable marine fuel supply is limited and significantly more expensive than conventional fuel. The core challenge has been the lack of a scalable, cost-effective feedstock and the technical difficulty of converting raw, inconsistent biomass into a high-quality, “drop-in” fuel that performs like its petroleum counterpart.

Analysis

This innovation is driven by the market need for a cost-competitive, scalable SAF solution that does not compete with food crops. The scientific discovery centers on a new chemical process that efficiently handles the complexity of raw biomass. The existing challenge involves high logistics costs for transporting bulky agricultural and forestry waste to a central refinery. This new process converts the waste into a dense, lower-carbon biocrude at the collection site.

This on-site conversion dramatically cuts transport costs and solves the technical challenge of refining the biocrude into high-quality, ready-to-use fuel. Think of this new process like a decentralized coffee grinder that turns bulky beans into a dense, shippable concentrate right at the farm, making the final brewing (refining) process simpler and cheaper at the main facility.

Outlook

This technology implies a significant shift in the sustainable fuel supply chain, moving production closer to the feedstock source. The next signal to watch for is the announcement of major commercial-scale partnerships with large agricultural producers or forestry companies, and the first deployment of the modular plants.

The Rolls-Royce UltraFan is the world’s largest technology demonstrator jet engine. It is designed to test a range of new technologies for next-generation jet engines. The UltraFan has a massive fan diameter of 3.5 meters (140 inches), larger than the world’s most powerful jet engine, the GE9X (3.4 meters, 134 inches).

The company aims to test thrust performance and propulsive efficiency over a range of 25,000 to 110,000 bf thrust. The UltraFan promises greater fuel efficiency than existing engines, lower carbon emissions, and compatibility with alternative fuels.

Redefining propulsive efficiency through the design

The propulsive efficiency of a turbofan engine depends on various factors, the most important of which is bypass ratio. It is the ratio of the airflow entering the engine core to the airflow bypassing through the secondary duct.

With the ultra-large fan and a compact core, Rolls-Royce is set to hit a home run with the demonstrator design. A unique combination of carbon/titanium fan blades and a new engine core architecture will maximise fuel burn efficiency while reducing emissions.

The UltraFan design benefits from advanced manufacturing and material technologies. Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM) techniques are used to produce major components of the engine. Such 3D techniques allow building of industrial objectives in successive layers using digital models.

Unlike traditional subtractive technologies that relied on grinding and machining of metal blocks, the ALM method reduces material waste and allows the creation of intricate designs. The technique also minimises component weight while increasing the accuracy and precision of complex parts.

The UltraFan’s Power Gearbox also holds a world record

The Ultrafan is a geared design featuring the world’s most powerful accessory gearbox, termed Power Gearbox (PGB). In 2021, UltraFan’s PGB set a world record by reaching 64 megawatts (87,000 horsepower) during a test in the company’s facility in Dahlewitz, Germany. Enough to power a small city, the Power Gearbox demonstrated sheer performance and durability – the two parameters essential for next-generation engines.

Dr. Holger Klinger, the subsystem executive of PGB at Rolls-Royce, stated,

“Reaching this record is another great achievement that showcases the performance and durability of this key component for our UltraFan programme. The power gearbox technology is central to the success of the next generation of Rolls-Royce jet engines, and I’m proud to see us pushing the engineering boundaries again.”

Apart from power, endurance, and reliability validation, the PGB demonstrated successful testing on the Altitude Rig, simulating different phases of flight.

First successful tests of the UltraFan

In November 2023, Rolls-Royce completed the first successful tests of its UltraFan demonstrator engine to maximum power. The manufacturer conducted the tests at its Testbed 80 facility in Derby, UK. The first tests were conducted using 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), demonstrating strong compatibility with alternative fuels. Rolls-Royce stated that the tests were in line with expectations and that several futuristic technologies were tested during the run.

The CEO of Rolls-Royce, Tufan Erginbilgic, states,

“Hitting full power with our UltraFan demonstrator sends a strong message that we are leading the way in the transition to more efficient and sustainable aviation. This fantastic milestone puts us in a strong position to support the plans of our customers as they develop the next generation of super-efficient aircraft.”

The Rolls-Royce UltraFan demonstrator is scalable to both widebody and narrowbody aircraft. Rolls-Royce states that commercial versions of the type may emerge in the early 2030s. The technologies built on the UltraFan enable 25% greater fuel efficiency than first-generation Trent engines, and 10% greater efficiency over the Trent XWB engine.

The forum gathered more than 1,000 participants from over 50 countries, including senior executives from international and domestic companies across the energy, agriculture, finance, pharmaceuticals, and consulting sectors.

Thirteen commercial agreements worth $3.8 billion were signed in the presence of Prime Minister Olzhas Bektenov.

Opening the forum, Bektenov said that Kazakhstan remains open and predictable for long-term investments and continues to maintain direct dialogue with investors.

“Kazakhstan remains an open and predictable country for long-term investments. Building a relationship of trust with investors is an integral part of our investment policy. I invite everyone to make full use of the opportunities available for developing business in Kazakhstan. We are ready to provide comprehensive support at every stage of project implementation,” said Bektenov.

He emphasized that the country is shifting toward a model in which the government not only supports but also initiates projects in partnership with investors. Over the first nine months of 2025, Kazakhstan’s gross domestic product grew by 6.3%, while investment in fixed capital increased by 13.5% to 13.8 trillion tenge (US$26.04 billion).

Key agreements across manufacturing, energy and agriculture

The roundtable resulted in agreements across multiple industries and regions.

Biesse said in a statement on Thursday that the partnership enables the firm to leverage sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), aiming for a 30 percent reduction in carbon emissions associated with their inbound and outbound air freight between Europe and Southeast Asia.

This translates to projected annual savings of approximately 15 tons in Well-to-Wheel (WTW) CO2e, considering estimated 50 tons emitted in 2024 for Biesse Malaysia.

“Biesse is addressing the climate reality head on and utilising solutions where they can make the most impact,” said Alessio Cadeddu, Chief Financial Officer of Biesse Asia.

“The cross-border nature of supply chains today means there is a pressing need for the decarbonization of air transport.

“SAF represents an effective and available step in this energy transition. Together with DHL Express, we can

help expand its commercial adoption and improve carbon outcomes across sectors,” he added.

Julian Neo, Managing Director of DHL Express Malaysia and Brunei, added SAF is currently one of the most promising means of reducing emissions in air transport, and requires a collaborative effort from the entire ecosystem of partners in the industry to drive progress.

“We are delighted to welcome Biesse on board our GoGreen Plus offering, as their support contributes to boosting demand, production, and uptake of SAF,

“This reflects our continued commitment to decarbonize the logistics industry by promoting SAF accessibility and affordability to more businesses,” he added.

By integrating AI across emissions detection, monitoring, and operational optimisation, ADNOC and its partners are demonstrating that cross-industry collaboration can set new benchmarks for environmental stewardship, efficiency, and digital innovation in the sector.","The oil and gas sector is shifting from exploration of digital solutions to tangible execution, with AI increasingly at the centre of operational strategy, according to insights from the second edition of ADNOC and Microsoft’s Powering Possible Report, which was released earlier this week.

Specifically, ADNOC, together with co-investors and technology partners including G42 and Microsoft, is advancing a programme to reduce methane emissions and achieve zero routine flaring across its operations by 2030.

The report highlights that these efforts leverage AI-driven platforms, IoT sensors, and advanced analytics to monitor operations in real time, optimise flare management, and support scaling carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). Cross-industry collaboration is central to progress: Microsoft’s investment in Twelve and partnership with Alaska Airlines demonstrates how captured CO₂ can be converted into sustainable aviation fuel, while engagements with low-carbon cement and near-zero emission steel producers show how AI can catalyse broader low-carbon innovation across supply chains.

The Powering Possible Report shows that while AI investment is rising, organisations are increasingly pragmatic about its deployment. Executives emphasise that aligning AI ambitions with physical infrastructure, workforce readiness, and grid capacity is critical. AI is now being deployed for predictive maintenance, operational optimisation, and emissions monitoring. ADNOC, for example, uses AI-powered flare monitoring to deliver real-time data that supports regulatory compliance and emission control strategies, reducing emissions in a cost-effective manner.

However, challenges persist and survey data in the report highlights that workforce skills gaps remain a top barrier, cited by 39% of respondents, while data quality and cybersecurity also rank highly.

Cultural factors—such as trust in AI recommendations versus traditional experience—have emerged as additional hurdles. Companies are responding by upskilling staff, providing AI literacy training, and embedding responsible AI frameworks into operations.

The report also underscores the need for supportive policies and regulatory alignment. While a loose regulatory landscape can encourage rapid development, the absence of comprehensive frameworks may hinder long-term adoption. Policy modernisation, regulatory sandboxes, and incentives for clean energy are essential to enable scalable AI deployment and sustainable energy transformation.

Along those lines, the Delta SkyMiles program has just launched such a promotion, with an interesting twist (thanks to Joe for flagging this).

New Delta Elevate Your Status promotion launches

Delta SkyMiles members have the opportunity to qualify for a higher Medallion elite status tier in 2026, with the new Elevate Your Status promotion. This opportunity is available between November 1 and December 31, 2025, and it’s intended for US-based SkyMiles members.

Specifically, eligible members can make a one-time purchase of Medallion Qualifying Dollars (MQDs) to help them reach the next elite tier. MQDs are the primary metric by which elite status in the SkyMiles program is awarded nowadays. The interesting twist here is that 100% of the proceeds (excluding processing fees) will be used to support Delta’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) program.

In order to be eligible for this promotion, you must be in one of the following categories, not too far from the next tier:

Be a SkyMiles non-elite member with between 4,500 and 4,599 MQDs (to earn Silver status)

Be a SkyMiles Silver member with between 9,000 and 9,999 MQDs (to earn Gold status)

Be a SkyMiles Gold member with between 13,500 and 14,999 MQDs (to earn Platunum status)

Be a SkyMiles Platinum member with between 25,500 and 27,999 MQDs (to earn Diamond status)

Every 100 MQDs cost $300, and Delta takes an 8.3% cut

When I first read about this promotion, I assumed that you’d basically be paying the “going rate” for MQDs. In other words, if you wanted to acquire 500 MQDs with this promotion, I assumed you’d have to spend $500 on sustainable aviation fuel. So instead of getting flights for the money you spend, you’re instead just be doing something good.

But no, it’s actually not quite that “generous.” The cost for every 100 MQDs is actually $300. So yeah, if you’re 1,000 MQDs short of qualifying for an elite tier, you could either spend $1,000 on a Delta ticket, or spend $3,000 on this venture. With that kind of a conversion rate, maybe we should call them MQPs (Medallion Qualifying Pesos)? 😉

For what it’s worth, Delta is partnering with Norway’s Choose on this program. Oh, and Delta’s “processing fee” is 8.3%.

Everyone can decide for themselves whether this offer is worth it or not. I’ll of course mention that the value of airline elite status has certainly decreased over the years, given how much tougher upgrades have become. And the SkyMiles program is particularly unrewarding in terms of upgrades, award redemption rates, etc.

Bottom line

Introduction – What is SAF?

When we think about an industry’s decarbonization potential, we typically first ask the question: “Can it be electrified?” If the answer is no, this is usually labeled a hard-to-abate industry. Aviation – representing ~3% of global greenhouse gas emissions annually, with its high energy density requirements – is one such industry. In the absence of feasible electric aviation at scale, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is the best lever we have at our disposal for airline decarbonization, with IATA estimating that 65% of aviation’s pathway to net zero will come from SAF usage.

SAF is a broad term referring to any fuel that can be “dropped in” (more accurately, blended) as a jet fuel replacement, resulting in a reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions – typically a 50–90% reduction in carbon intensity compared to conventional jet fuel. SAF supply pathways differ primarily by feedstock and production method – there are 11 ASTM-approved pathways today, including pack leader HEFA (fuel derived from used cooking oil), ATJ (fuel derived from ethanol or other alcohols), and “eSAF” (synthetic fuel generated using captured carbon and green hydrogen).

State of SAF Today

There are several advantages that SAF enjoys which make it potentially more politically resilient than our resident renewables. One of the major supply pathways is sourced from corn production (which, at least in the US, enjoys large bipartisan support), and many oil & gas refineries and logistics assets can be retrofitted to support SAF production, providing a tangible way for traditional energy companies to participate in the energy transition.

Yet despite these relative political advantages – and the weight of the aviation world on its shoulders – SAF production and consumption have been severely limited. Global production in 2024 represented only ~0.3% of jet fuel use (~350 million gallons), with this number expected to reach ~0.7% in 2025. Airlines for Europe (A4E), a lobby group, recently stated that airlines will not likely be able to meet the EU’s 6% sustainable aviation fuel mandate by 2030 because of a lack of SAF production capacity. Much of this becomes less of a mystery when we reveal the cost: SAF’s Levelized Cost of Fuel (LCOF) is typically 3–10× the cost of conventional jet fuel. In an industry notorious for paper-thin margins, this is not sustainable.

The Case for Book and Claim

How can SAF simultaneously come down the cost curve and attract outside investment or project finance without fear of stranded assets? The only realistic answer is increased bankability through longer-term offtakes. Currently, roughly 50% of signed SAF offtake agreements are one-year contracts, and 70% are under five years (DOE, Pathways to Commercial Liftoff). These are not bankable contracts that provide enough de-risking capacity for cheaper sources of financing to enter and supplement today’s largely VC-, CVC-, or balance sheet–driven capital stacks. This is where Book and Claim comes in.

Book and Claim is a custody model used in commodity industries that separates the actual physical product from its environmental attributes. Applied to SAF, this means that an airline operating entirely in Europe could purchase and claim the environmental attributes of SAF produced and consumed in Brazil. The clean fuel is still burned, providing carbon abatement compared to baseline jetfuel, while the environmental benefit is claimed by the purchasing airline. While a hot topic in aviation lately, this is not a new concept. For example, when you read the headline—“NextEra signs 500 MW clean energy deal with Meta to power new data center”—Meta is not actually receiving physical delivery of the electrons. Electrons go where physics dictates, not where the invoice says. This is the beauty of the Virtual Power Purchase Agreement (VPPA): the offtaker signs a financial contract at a fixed price for electricity from a plant that isn’t co-located with its operations. Meta locks in predictable power pricing, the developer secures a long-term offtake with a blue-chip counterparty that it can present to financiers, and the messy physical delivery is removed from the equation. While not the exact same model (VPPA’s incentive is primarily for price hedging), this procurement mindset can and should transfer to the use of Book and Claim for SAF.

As mentioned earlier, SAF production is heavily dependent on feedstock availability, which is naturally constrained to specific geographies and, for the most part, consists of perishable biogenic products that are difficult to transport. For example, the U.S. and Brazil alone are expected to hold nearly 30% of global biomass feedstock potential for SAF production by 2030 (IATA Global Feedstock Assessment). Yet airlines operate globally, with Asia and Europe leading policy mandates for fuel blending. This geographic mismatch is exactly what the Book and Claim custody model solves.",https://whartonenergyclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Wharton-Energy-Club-150x150.png,N,,2025-11-01 08:56:46.167622

While the company's shares have reacted positively to the announcement, its underlying financial fundamentals present a more complex picture. The central question for investors is whether this massive order can provide the sustained momentum needed to overcome broader industry challenges and steer the company toward lasting profitability.

A Landmark Agreement and Its Market Impact

The company has entered into a binding supply agreement with Allied Biofuels FE LLC for up to 2 gigawatts of its PEM electrolyzer systems. This contract is designated for a new facility in Uzbekistan that will focus on the production of sustainable aviation fuel and green diesel. When combined with a previous 3-gigawatt collaboration in Australia, the total contracted capacity with Allied partners reaches a substantial 5 gigawatts.

This agreement ranks among the largest electrolyzer deals announced in 2025, representing a tangible step forward in the company's strategic execution. The market's initial response was favorable, translating into notable share price gains. However, a critical hurdle remains: the final investment decision for the Uzbekistan project is not anticipated until the fourth quarter of 2026.

Financial Performance: Growth Tempered by Losses

The company's robust order intake contrasts with its mixed financial forecasts. Revenue for the current quarter is projected to be $179.14 million, which would represent a modest year-over-year increase of 3.1 percent. Looking further ahead, estimates for the current and next fiscal years stand at $707.53 million and $850.63 million, respectively, pointing to potential growth of 12.5% and 20.2%.

However, the profitability outlook reveals a more challenging path:

* The current quarter is expected to show a loss of $0.13 per share.

* The present fiscal year is forecast to conclude with a loss of $0.62 per share.

* A turnaround is not projected until the following year, with analysts predicting a profit of $0.31 per share.

Navigating a Challenging Industry Landscape

Plug Power's recent commercial successes are unfolding against a backdrop of significant sector-wide pressures. The broader hydrogen mobility segment is confronting considerable obstacles, evidenced by several major automakers scaling back their hydrogen fuel cell initiatives. General Motors and Stellantis are among those who have either halted or significantly curtailed development efforts for light-duty vehicles.

These corporations cite high costs and an underdeveloped refueling infrastructure as primary reasons for their strategic pullback. This industry-wide deceleration poses a potential threat and has already led to a marked reduction in the global demand forecast for fuel cell stacks in light vehicles throughout 2025.

The pivotal issue remains: Is this monumental contract sufficient to propel Plug Power through these industry-wide turbulences and finally pave its long-awaited path to profitability?

Airbus EVP of Commercial Aircraft Sales, Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, called the move a major endorsement of the A350F’s performance in the large freighter segment.

The A350F is currently the only all-new large freighter under development. It features the industry’s largest main deck cargo door and a fuselage optimized for standard pallets and containers.

More than 70% of the airframe is made from advanced lightweight materials, giving the aircraft a take-off weight 46 tonnes lower than comparable models.

Performance, Efficiency, and Environmental Compliance

The A350F can carry up to 111 tonnes of payload and fly up to 4,700 nautical miles (8,700 km). Powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines, it delivers up to 40% lower fuel consumption and carbon emissions compared to previous-generation freighters with similar range and capacity.

It is also the only freighter designed to meet ICAO’s enhanced CO₂ emissions standards set to take effect in 2027. This compliance positions the A350F as a key part of the global shift toward sustainable air cargo operations.

Airbus A350 Family Growth

As of September 2025, the Airbus A350 Family has accumulated 1,445 orders from 63 customers worldwide, including 65 for the A350F from 10 cargo operators and one leasing company.

For Korean Air, the updated order now includes 20 A350-1000s, seven A350Fs, and six A350-900s—two of which have already been delivered. The airline also has 39 Airbus A321neo aircraft on order, reinforcing its ongoing fleet modernization strategy across both passenger and cargo operations.

Airbus Gets Major Order from South Asian Carrier

Vietjet (VJ), Vietnam’s largest private airline, has turned its June Memorandum of Understanding into a firm purchase for 100 Airbus A321neo aircraft. The agreement reinforces Vietjet’s rapid growth plan and continued fleet modernization efforts.

With this order, Vietjet now holds commitments for 280 A321neo aircraft, further strengthening its partnership with Airbus and aligning with the carrier’s regional and global expansion strategy.

The firm order for 100 A321neo aircraft marks a pivotal step in Vietjet’s long-term growth strategy. This deal follows closely after the airline’s order of 20 A330neo widebody aircraft in May, confirming its position as a key Airbus customer in Asia.

According to Vietjet Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao, the agreement represents more than a commercial transaction—it’s a symbol of trust and shared ambition for sustainable connectivity. The deal also reflects Vietjet’s focus on cost efficiency and route flexibility, particularly in high-demand markets across Asia-Pacific.

Airbus Executive Vice President Benoît de Saint-Exupéry highlighted the operational benefits of the A321neo, noting that the aircraft’s efficiency and performance will help Vietjet achieve competitive economics and operational commonality across its fleet.

Sustainability and Performance Advantages

The Airbus A321neo is the largest model in the A320neo Family and is known for its extended range, reduced fuel burn, and lower emissions. Featuring next-generation engines and Sharklets, it cuts fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions by more than 20%, while reducing noise by 50%.

Vietjet’s decision to prioritize the A321neo supports its environmental targets, as the aircraft can operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) today, with Airbus aiming for full SAF capability by 2030.

This aligns with the industry-wide goal of reducing aviation’s carbon footprint while maintaining network flexibility and comfort for passengers.

Strengthening a Long-Term Partnership

Vietjet’s growing Airbus fleet underscores a strong and strategic partnership between the two companies.

By combining the A321neo’s narrow-body efficiency with the A330neo’s wide-body range, Vietjet is well-positioned to serve both domestic and long-haul international routes from Tan Son Nhat International Airport (SGN) and other key hubs.

As of September 2025, more than 7,100 A321neo aircraft have been ordered by nearly 100 airlines worldwide, solidifying its position as one of the most successful single-aisle aircraft programs globally.

Digital tools, AI, and data systems are key for tracking, reporting, and optimising emissions across the supply chain.

Collaboration, benchmarking, and sustainability-linked finance are increasingly shaping investment, strategy, and industry-wide alignment.

Air cargo operators, forwarders, and supply chain partners are entering a more regulated sustainability environment, driven by new disclosure frameworks, emissions reporting rules, and industry-wide decarbonisation targets. Regulatory change is moving sustainability beyond voluntary commitments, with mandatory Scope 3 emissions reporting due to expand significantly under Corporate Sustainability Reporting (CSR) rules by 2027. At the same time, governments, financiers, and customers are applying pressure for measurable progress toward the sector’s goal of net zero by 2050, increasing the focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), operational efficiency, and data transparency.

Sustainability performance is becoming integrated into commercial decision-making. “Sustainability is becoming a factor of doing business,” said Glyn Hughes, Director General of The International Air Cargo Association (Tiaca).

“Regulators, financiers, customers, and employees are all looking for evidence that organisations understand and can demonstrate their environmental and social impact.”

Chris McDermott, Chief Executive at CHAMP, said sustainability reporting is influencing how companies evaluate technology and capital investment. “We are seeing more companies appoint senior roles dedicated to sustainability,” he said. “This is now tied to strategy, not only reporting.”

SAF pathways and the Net Zero commitment

SAF is expected to deliver the largest share of the air transport sector’s decarbonisation contribution over the next three decades. The International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) Long-Term Aspirational Goal and regional policies, including the European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, position SAF as the primary route to reducing aviation emissions while maintaining global freight capacity. ReFuelEU requires SAF blending to rise from minimal use today to 70 percent by 2050, representing a structural shift in how airlines procure and manage fuel.

However, the current availability of SAF remains limited. Production capacity is constrained, and costs remain between three and five times higher than conventional aviation fuel. Feedstock supply, certification processes, and regional policy mismatches further restrict scalability. “SAF currently costs three to five times more than conventional jet fuel, and expanding production requires significant capital investment,” said Arnaud Brolly, Founder and Chief Executive of Impact, which operates a marketplace for SAF certificates.

Forwarders and shippers are increasingly seeking SAF-based services to meet their own emissions reduction commitments. Leading logistics operators have introduced programmes allowing customers to purchase SAF-linked emission reductions for individual shipments. Several airlines have also expanded SAF purchase options at booking level. This is creating new commercial models in which both airlines and forwarders act as intermediaries between SAF producers and cargo customers.

Certification has become essential to prevent double counting and ensure emissions claims are auditable. SAF certificates decouple the environmental attribute of the fuel from its physical use, allowing airlines to claim Scope 1 reductions and shippers to claim Scope 3 reductions using the same verified emission savings within established accounting rules. CHAMP, for example, has supported customer reporting needs through data-backed documentation linked to its hydroelectric-powered data centres. “Customers need audited data to report emissions accurately,” said Marjorie Guerrero, Executive Assistant to the CEO and ESG Coordinator at CHAMP.

Operational efficiency, data systems, and technology integration

With SAF supply limited in the near term, carriers and cargo handlers are pursuing operational efficiency measures to reduce emissions intensity. Flight planning optimisation, improved aircraft weight and balance systems, and ground efficiency measures are delivering incremental reductions. Aircraft models continue to improve in efficiency, but fleet renewal cycles remain constrained by supply chain lead times and capital availability. Industry reports indicate that the global commercial fleet is ageing due to extended asset lifecycles and delivery backlogs.

Digitalisation is central to both emissions reduction and reporting readiness. Automated tracking, network planning optimisation, and sensor-based fleet management are enabling more accurate fuel burn measurement and resource allocation. Scope 3 reporting, in particular, requires standardised data exchange between airlines, forwarders, and shippers. Industry surveys show that data alignment remains a primary barrier to credible sustainability reporting. “Data collection and alignment across stakeholders is one of the areas where companies struggle most,” Hughes said.

Artificial intelligence and Internet of Things tools are being integrated to support predictive resource management, real-time visibility, and continuous emissions tracking. However, the increased use of data-intensive systems introduces energy sourcing implications. McDermott highlighted that digital infrastructure planning will have to integrate renewable power availability.

“Technology is essential to efficiency gains, but energy supply for data architecture must be aligned with sustainability objectives.”

The growth of sustainability-linked finance is also changing the investment landscape. Financial institutions are increasingly applying emissions and governance criteria to lending and investment conditions. Some financing agreements require ongoing sustainability performance reporting, linking interest rates or credit access to verified outcomes. Industry advisers note that sustainability-linked finance is accelerating board-level engagement and influencing procurement decisions for IT systems, vehicles, equipment, and facilities.

Collaborative frameworks are emerging to support alignment and benchmarking. Tiaca’s BlueSky sustainability assessment programme provides companies with structured evaluation and comparison tools across multiple dimensions, including environmental, social, and governance factors. Such frameworks are being used to identify gaps, prioritise investment, and compare performance across regions and business models. “Assessment tools like BlueSky are helping companies benchmark sustainability performance and prioritise investment,” Hughes said.

The direction of policy and regulatory development indicates that sustainability reporting and fuel transition requirements will tighten further. As compliance expands, airfreight stakeholders are focusing on building resilient data systems, integrating SAF-based commercial models, and coordinating emissions strategies across supply chain partners. The sector’s decarbonisation path will require sustained investment, cross-industry collaboration, and continued development of verifiable reporting practices. “The next generation of sustainability leaders will need both technological insight and operational expertise to drive meaningful change,” McDermott said.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AdobeStock_410592669-1080x720.jpeg,N,,2025-10-31 17:01:12.777398

“Tourism, going forward, is going to be a key part of growth … becoming an even more important part of the economy in the Philippines,” he said on Friday (Oct 31).

As an archipelago of around 7,000 islands, the Philippines relies heavily on air travel to connect its many regions and communities. The domestic market accounts for about 70 per cent of Cebu Pacific’s total capacity.

“There aren’t many alternatives when it comes to public transportation. From an economic standpoint, the domestic market will remain extremely resilient,” Szucs said.

“The international market, that will be more subject because there's more discretionary spending both for incoming (tourists) and those outbound. But even so, the population growth is so big. It's such a large, addressable market.”

FLEET EXPANSION

On Friday, the budget airline announced a two-month partnership with Bulgarian national carrier Bulgaria Air to boost capacity during the holiday season.

In December and January, two Airbus A320ceo aircraft will fly four domestic routes from Manila to Cebu, Davao, Iloilo and Cagayan de Oro.

Under the arrangement, Bulgaria Air will provide the aircraft, pilots, maintenance and insurance, while Cebu Pacific will supply cabin crew.

To meet long-term growing demand, Cebu Pacific last year ordered 152 Airbus jets worth US$24 billion. The order begins in 2029 and will be delivered through 2035, Szucs told CNA.

Amid a global aircraft shortage caused by supply chain disruptions, some airlines have turned to China’s Commercial Aircraft Corporation (COMAC) as an alternative to Airbus and Boeing. Szucs said the competition is healthy for the industry.

“It's great that there is potential for another manufacturer of jets coming onto the scene. Competition improves products and also improves economics,” he said.

He added that Cebu Pacific would consider COMAC planes once they receive international certifications.

“COMAC will have to go through the certification requirements, principally with the FAA and ISSA,” he said, referring to the United States’ Federal Aviation Administration and the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) Standard Safety Assessment.

“That's clearly on their milestones, and it's clearly going to happen at some point. As soon as COMAC is available, it's something that we will consider.”

SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL

As airlines worldwide race toward net-zero emissions, Szucs said he believes sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) offers the most practical way forward.

SAF is a liquid fuel made from feedstock including waste oil and fats. It can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to traditional jet fuel.

Unlike hydrogen or electric alternatives, sustainable aviation fuel can be used immediately with existing aircraft and airport infrastructure.

Other proposed technologies would require modified or new aircraft engines, infrastructure and regulatory systems that do not yet exist at scale.

Despite its promise, the main challenge with sustainable aviation fuel is its limited availability and high cost. It accounted for just 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production in 2024, and is between two and five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel.

“All aircraft today and for the foreseeable future will need hydrocarbon fuel, and SAF is the way. Airlines need to explore ways of how we can get more SAF produced on an economic scale,” he said.

Szucs noted that unlike fossil fuels, which are concentrated in certain parts of the world, sustainable aviation fuel has one clear advantage: it can be produced locally – potentially stimulating domestic economies in the process.

FLEET MODERNISATION

The Cebu Pacific CEO said the most impactful step airlines can take today is upgrading to more fuel-efficient aircraft and engines.

Currently, about 72 per cent of the carrier’s all-Airbus fleet is fitted with advanced engine options that reduce fuel burn by around 18 per cent, Szucs said.

Beyond aircraft upgrades, another practical way to reduce the industry’s carbon footprint is electrifying ground operations and vehicles such as airport buses, pushback tractors and baggage carts, he added.

“Everyone’s got an obligation to make sure they're taking the steps on what I consider to be the low-hanging fruits. That's deliverable today. Airlines should be progressively replacing (such) equipment,” he said.","https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--nLChqtM1--/c_crop,h_444,w_790,x_0,y_0/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2025/10/31/screenshot_324.png?itok=e6VqVhfz",N,,2025-10-31 12:01:40.371251

The process begins with hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of waste feedstock, such as by-products from a nearby food-processing facility, turning organic waste into a biocrude oil. This biocrude then undergoes catalytic hydrotreating using a cobalt-molybdenum catalyst to strip out unwanted elements such as nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen. The result: a hydrocarbon blend that passes Tier Alpha and Beta pre-screening by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and meets specifications for conventional jet fuel.

The researchers emphasize that food waste is just one viable feedstock; the HTL platform can process a wide range of biowaste, including sewage sludge, algal blooms, swine manure, and agricultural residue. That flexibility helps avoid the food-versus-fuel debate, supporting a true circular bio-economy model. According to lead author Sabrina Summers, the engineering work “solves the science and engineering problems” so that industry can scale the approach.

From a design and engineering perspective, this work is significant for several reasons: it provides a drop-in solution that operates within existing jet-fuel infrastructure; it addresses the twin challenges of carbon emissions and waste management; and it creates business-model opportunities at the intersection of food processing, waste conversion, and aviation fuel supply. The path to commercial scale remains: cost control, feedstock logistics, catalyst lifetime, and refinery integration must still be addressed. For engineers involved in process design, systems integration, and sustainability road mapping, this research underlines that waste streams can become high-value inputs in high-energy domains such as aviation.

Therefore, if future air travel is to be sustainable then one key question that we must answer concerns our ability to produce aviation fuel in a sustainable manner.
In this regard, we need to address the critical challenge of scaling up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in the United States to satisfy the government’s goal of meeting 100 percent of aviation fuel demand with SAF by 2050.

Upfront payments uniquely change this pattern, enabling miscanthus production in the Midwest while switchgrass remains dominant in the Southern U.S.","It is now well known that air travel by humans has risen and that it will continue to rise in the foreseeable future. Therefore, if future air travel is to be sustainable then one key question that we must answer concerns our ability to produce aviation fuel in a sustainable manner. In this regard, we need to address the critical challenge of scaling up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in the United States to satisfy the government’s goal of meeting 100 percent of aviation fuel demand with SAF by 2050.

Since current SAF production is only a fraction of total jet fuel use, scaling up requires a shift from food-based feedstocks to high-yield, low-carbon, cellulosic biomass sources such as miscanthus, switchgrass, and corn stover. However, the problem is that miscanthus—despite its high yield and carbon sequestration potential, entails large upfront establishment costs, longer maturity periods, and greater yield uncertainty, which discourage adoption by farmers with limited credit or higher risk aversion. On the other hand, switchgrass and corn stover, while lower yielding, pose fewer financial and intertemporal risks.

New research sheds interesting light on the potential of cellulosic feedstocks — specifically perennial bioenergy crops like miscanthus and switchgrass, and the crop residue corn stover — to provide a low-carbon alternative to petroleum-based jet fuel. The point to note is that the adoption of these feedstocks, particularly high-yielding miscanthus, is hindered by significant barriers for farmers, including high upfront establishment costs, delayed returns, and risks that differ from conventional annual crops like corn and soybeans.

The research demonstrates how different farmer characteristics, i.e., risk aversion, time preferences (discount rates), and access to credit, influence the supply and mix of these feedstocks. Furthermore, it evaluates the cost-effectiveness of two alternative carbon payment designs in overcoming these barriers and incentivizing the production of feedstocks that maximize carbon mitigation.

Integrated, economic-biogeochemical modeling yields three noteworthy provoking insights. First, the characteristics of U.S. farmers affect their feedstock choice and SAF supply. Under a “Low-Constraint” scenario (meaning low risk aversion, low discount rate, and access to credit), farmers predominantly choose the high-yielding, low-carbon miscanthus at moderate biomass prices, leading to substantial SAF production. In contrast, “High-Constraint” farmers (meaning highly risk-averse, present-biased, and credit-constrained) overwhelmingly prefer the lower-yielding but less risky switchgrass, resulting in up to 48 percent lower SAF production at the same biomass price. Importantly, credit constraints are the single most significant barrier to miscanthus adoption.

Second, the design of carbon payments is pivotal. The research under discussion compares an “Annual Payment” (which is a yearly payment per ton of carbon dioxide mitigated) with an “Upfront Payment” (which is a lump sum paid in the first year for the total carbon mitigated over a 15-year crop lifespan).

For credit-constrained farmers, upfront payments are far more effective. Put differently, upfront payments are more cost-effective per dollar spent on carbon mitigation for this group. In contrast, for farmers with access to credit, annual payments are generally more cost-effective. These farmers, less burdened by initial costs, respond better to a steady income stream and choose the most efficient feedstock for carbon mitigation in their region without needing a large upfront sum.

Third, the spatial pattern of feedstock production shifts with policy and farmer characteristics. Without carbon payments, “High-Constraint” farmers avoid miscanthus even in the high-yielding Midwest. Upfront payments uniquely change this pattern, enabling miscanthus production in the Midwest while switchgrass remains dominant in the Southern U.S. This demonstrates that effective policy can alter the geographic distribution of bioenergy crops.

Policies that ignore farmer heterogeneity are likely to overestimate the potential for bioenergy crop production. One-size-fits-all policies, such as tax credits like annual payments, may fail to engage credit-constrained or risk-averse farmers. Instead, a targeted approach is necessary. Policymakers should consider hybrid incentives that include upfront cost-share components or risk-mitigating instruments like insurance, tailored to the carbon performance of different feedstocks and the financial realities of different farmers.

In sum, we learn that the successful decarbonization of aviation through SAF depends not only on feedstock agronomy and conversion technology but critically on the nuanced design of economic incentives that account for the diverse risk, time, and financial constraints of the farmers who will ultimately produce the necessary biomass.

The binding term sheet grants New Rise AU an exclusive 15-year license to use the design, layout, and configuration of XCF's New Rise Reno facility to build and operate at least three SAF facilities across Australia. XCF will receive a 12.5% equity stake, licensing fees, and one board seat in New Rise AU.

Australia is emerging as one of the world's most promising markets for renewable fuel. A Deloitte report commissioned by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation highlights a AUD$36 billion opportunity to develop a world-leading low-carbon liquid fuels (LCLF) industry capable of cutting emissions by 230 million tons by 2050 and strengthening the country's energy independence.

Australia imports ~80% of its liquid fuels, spending more than AUD$50 billion in 2023 alone, while exporting AUD$3.9 billion in potential LCLF feedstocks. With less than 50 days of fuel reserves currently held onshore, well below the International Energy Agency's recommended 90 days, the country's reliance on imports leaves it vulnerable to global disruptions.

Recognizing this imbalance, the Australian federal government has prioritized low-carbon liquid fuels under its Future Made in Australia initiative, providing access to the AUD$1.7 billion Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund to support the development of a LCLF industry, which includes SAF and renewable diesel.

With major airlines like Qantas and Virgin Australia targeting net-zero emissions by 2050, demand for locally produced SAF is expected to surge, creating strong momentum for investment and development across the region.

This milestone builds on XCF's international expansion strategy, built on capital-efficient, regionally tailored partnerships that accelerate global SAF adoption. It follows the June 2025 Memorandum of Understanding entered into with Continual Renewable Ventures Pty. Ltd., which laid the foundation for today's binding agreement.

Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global, commented, ""Our partnership with New Rise AU accelerates XCF's global expansion strategy and underscores the scalability of our modular renewable fuel platform. Australia combines strong policy momentum, growing aviation demand, and abundant feedstock resources, creating an excellent environment to develop renewable fuel facilities.

In Europe and the United States—the main production hubs—SAF is three to four times more expensive than conventional jet fuel.
“Petrobras is ready to supply renewable jet fuel (SAF) using Brazilian-developed technology as early as 2025, ahead of international requirements,” the company said, without giving a firm start date.
Latam Airlines is also monitoring domestic SAF production.
“That’s why the company supports public policies to encourage SAF production and use, ensuring a fair and affordable transition for the industry and passengers,” the statement said.","Worldwide, the aviation sector has pledged to reach net-zero CO₂ emissions by 2050. In Brazil, regulatory changes take effect in 2027, requiring airlines to cut emissions by at least 1% through the use of sustainable fuels.

According to consulting firm Bain & Company, the transportation sector accounts for 16% of global greenhouse-gas emissions—and 40% of those are considered hard to decarbonize through electrification. Aviation alone is responsible for about 2.5% of total global emissions.

In this context, sustainable fuels are viewed as the most viable short- and medium-term solution for reducing transport-sector emissions. Yet Bain estimates SAF’s share of global aviation fuel will rise only from about 1% today to 21% by 2050—based on national targets for its use, said Felipe Cammarata, a partner in Bain’s energy and natural resources practice in South America.

Brazil adopted its own targets under the Fuels of the Future Law, enacted in 2024. Under the law, airlines operating domestic flights must cut their emissions by 1% through the use of SAF starting in 2027, with the requirement gradually increasing to 10% by 2037.

Eduardo Calderon, director of operations, control, and sustainability at Gol, said the industry is concerned about the 2027 mandate, especially since Brazil still lacks domestic production of the biofuel. “Our concern is the 2027 target. Importing doesn’t make sense—and 2027 is right around the corner,” he said, noting that the higher cost of SAF is also a challenge. In Europe and the United States—the main production hubs—SAF is three to four times more expensive than conventional jet fuel.

While waiting for domestic supply to emerge, airlines are focusing on other measures to curb emissions, chiefly fleet renewal. Gol’s new Boeing 737 MAX aircraft emit 15% less CO₂ than the previous generation—a gain also achieved by other manufacturers.

In parallel, Gol is testing a pilot carbon-offset project based on the “Book & Claim” model, which allows it to buy carbon credits generated by other airlines abroad that have flown using sustainable fuel. The federal government is now debating whether to recognize this mechanism for official emissions accounting. “It’s a two-way street,” Mr. Calderon said. “Right now we offset through SAF used abroad. But once we start producing in Brazil, we won’t have to export the fuel to claim its sustainability attributes. It’s an important step while SAF isn’t physically available here.”

Several projects are under development in Brazil, with production expected to begin only after 2028. These include initiatives by Petrobras, Refinaria Riograndense, and Acelen. Petrobras is also developing renewable jet fuel using the same co-processing technology already applied to its renewable diesel. “Petrobras is ready to supply renewable jet fuel (SAF) using Brazilian-developed technology as early as 2025, ahead of international requirements,” the company said, without giving a firm start date. The earlier target had been mid-2024.

Latam Airlines is also monitoring domestic SAF production. The group has pledged to source 5% of its fuel from SAF by 2030. “Latam is committed to leading aviation’s transformation in South America and meeting the global goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 through energy efficiency, new technologies, SAF, and carbon offset via ecosystem conservation,” the company said in a statement. It described SAF as an “essential pillar” of decarbonization. Still, it acknowledged that its current cost remains a barrier. “That’s why the company supports public policies to encourage SAF production and use, ensuring a fair and affordable transition for the industry and passengers,” the statement said.

Azul also classifies SAF as a strategic issue in its operations and remains committed to the 2050 reduction goals. “To meet those goals, the use of SAF is essential,” said Filipe Alvarez, Azul’s sustainability and governance manager. “That’s why, even before the Fuels of the Future Law was approved, Azul was already working consistently to develop Brazil’s SAF supply chain, particularly through collaboration with the Brazilian Union of Biodiesel and Bio-kerosene (Ubrabio) and the National Sustainable Aviation Fuel Program (ProBioQAV) under the Ministry of Mines and Energy.”

Airports are also taking action. According to a joint survey by the Ministry of Ports and Airports (MPor) and the Association of Private Port Terminals (ATP), the Brazilian airport sector invested R$138.4 million in environmental initiatives in 2023 and 2024. Key decarbonization measures include replacing fossil-fuel systems with lower-impact alternatives such as electric ground-support equipment for aircraft.",https://s2-valorinternational.glbimg.com/kltoCoOIdRoBgOKbqPwHV69Gdkc=/1200x/smart/filters:cover():strip_icc()/i.s3.glbimg.com/v1/AUTH_63b422c2caee4269b8b34177e8876b93/internal_photos/bs/2025/3/R/0as3S9SCil6albfAPQQQ/foto30emp-101-saf-b4.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 09:56:12.726076

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) reports that Europe is on track to meet its target for adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2030. The move is good news for flying greener—but it brings travel implications as well.

What the target means

Under regulations like ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, SAF will gradually replace conventional jet fuel on flights departing from EU airports. The target calls for increasing SAF shares, making flights more sustainable. EASA says the industry is moving forward.

In 2024 EU-wide SAF supply reached about 0.6 % of aviation fuel. While small, it already cut roughly 714 000 tonnes of CO₂—roughly equal to 10 000 flights between Madrid and Paris.

What this means for you as a traveller

If you’re planning a holiday or a business trip across Europe, here’s what to consider:

You might choose flights on airlines emphasising SAF use. These carriers could market themselves as greener.

While direct flight paths remain largely unchanged, cost pressures may rise as airlines invest in SAF infrastructure. Some smaller carriers could adjust their route networks.

Airports in remote or less-served regions might face slower uptake if SAF distribution is uneven. That could affect connectivity for travel off the beaten path.

The hurdles ahead

Despite strong progress, hurdles remain. SAF currently costs roughly €2 085/tonne compared to about €734/tonne for conventional jet fuel. That price gap means scaling SAF remains challenging for many airlines.

Moreover, most SAF feedstock still comes from outside the EU: around 69 % as of recent data. Finland is Europe’s largest SAF producer, contributing about 10 % of the supply.

Travel-friendly destinations and shifting routes

For world travellers keen on exploring hidden European gems, the SAF shift presents both opportunity and caution. On the plus side: greener flights mean you can feel better about your carbon footprint when visiting scenic isles, countryside airports or cultural towns.

On the caution side: smaller airports may lag in SAF access. If airlines serving them struggle with cost or logistics, your connections could change. For example, you might land at a larger hub and transfer via ground transport rather than fly direct into lightly served airports.

Smart travel planning tips

Check if your airline has announced SAF-related sustainability efforts.

When flying to remote destinations, allow buffer time in your schedule in case carrier networks adjust.

Consider alternative transport options from major hubs—train or ferry may replace a direct regional flight.

Look for flights labelled with “lower emissions” or “eco-friendly fuel” offerings (some carriers offer them).

Why this shift matters for global travellers

The aviation sector accounts for a significant chunk of emissions. SAF is seen as one of the most effective means to bring those emissions down in the next decade. The EU estimates that SAF uptake will help reach the climate goals set for 2030 and beyond.

For you, the traveller, that means you can continue to explore Europe with more confidence in the long-term sustainability of air travel. From Lisbon to Lapland, from Mediterranean islands to Alpine valleys—you’re part of a broader move toward cleaner skies.

Looking ahead

EASA emphasises that a functioning reporting system is in place and that initial SAF deliveries are happening across Member States. The agency says the first annual technical report marks an important milestone for future efforts.

If all goes well, by 2030 airlines operating across Europe will blend significantly more SAF into their fuel mix. For your future flights this could mean slightly different aircraft, slightly different fuel sourcing, but many of the same beautiful destinations. What changes is the travel footprint you leave behind.

Final thoughts

Flying across Europe remains a seamless adventure for travellers from around the world. But as sustainability becomes integral to aviation, the experience subtly shifts. Routes may evolve, carriers may adjust, but the goal remains: to keep exploring Europe’s rich tapestry of places with less impact on the planet.

The formal signing ceremony, live on day three of the FII9 event, marked a pivotal milestone in RedCloud’s expansion into the Kingdom—aligning with Saudi Vision 2030 and the country’s strategic focus on digital transformation and supply chain modernization. The joint venture, RedCloud Arabia, will deploy RedAI’s algorithmic infrastructure to digitize and transform FMCG trade across the country.

The Company and Kayanat held joint meetings with key players within the Saudi FMCG Industry—who are believed to represent around 20% of the $61Bn market 3 —supporting a targeted launch date of December 2025.

“FII9 was a catalytic event for RedCloud, where we heard from industry leaders to heads of state who shared our concern for global trading challenges including spiraling consumer prices and the waste of critical resources,” said Justin Floyd, CEO and Founder of RedCloud. “Bloomberg built the intelligence foundation for financial markets. Google built it for the internet. Supply chains are next. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will be a pioneer and leader in solving this problem and we are delighted to work with Majid and his team on expanding RedCloud’s intelligence foundation for global trade, moving human guesswork and manual trading to algorithmic transformation.”

“For nearly 90 years, Saudi Arabia has powered the world through reliable and affordable energy supply chains. Today, that same advantage will fuel the world’s AI factories,” added Majid Alghaslan, Founder of Kayanat. “Our collaboration with RedCloud reflects Vision 2030’s ambition to transform the Kingdom into a global hub where technology, data, and intelligence redefine trade—building predictive, autonomous, and sustainable economies of the future.”

RedCloud Arabia intends to focus on localizing RedAI’s capabilities to serve Saudi distributors, retailers, and manufacturers, enabling smarter purchasing decisions and addressing inventory shortfalls. The Company believes that traditional AI and LLMs train on public internet data, while RedCloud trains its models on private b2b supply chain data that can’t be accessed by the AI incumbents. The Company’s platform has already demonstrated success in high-growth markets such as Nigeria, Brazil, and South Africa, and is now poised to bring similar impact to the Middle East.

The announcement follows significant operational momentum for RedCloud: the Company more than doubled customer numbers year-over-year in the first half of 2025, launched a new partnership strategy for payments and financial services to maximize working capital across supply chains, and expanded its technology ecosystem through the NVIDIA Connect program alongside existing partnerships with AWS and Snowflake.

FII9 convened around 600 global leaders 4 including heads of state, speakers and innovators under the theme “The Key to Prosperity: Unlocking New Frontiers of Growth.” RedCloud’s presence at the event underscored its commitment to building the intelligence foundation for the FMCG industry—from manufacturer to retailer—within Saudi Arabia, the Middle East, and beyond.

GEELONG, Australia, Oct. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Carbon Revolution plc (Nasdaq: CREV) (the “Company”), a Tier 1 OEM supplier and the leading global manufacturer of lightweight advanced technology automotive carbon fiber wheels, today announced that it has reached agreement with Orion Infrastructure Capital (“OIC”) to provide a further up to US$7 million of funding. The Company also reports the cancellation of two electric vehicle (“EV”) wheel programs, which is consistent with the weakening of demand across the broader EV market.

Further US$7 million of OIC funding

Of the up to US$7 million of OIC funding, US$5 million was released on October 31, 2025, in exchange for the issuance of additional senior secured notes. The notes will have substantially the same terms as the Company’s existing senior secured notes outstanding (the “Existing Notes”). In connection with this funding tranche, the Company will also issue to OIC penny warrants to purchase an aggregate number of shares equal to 5.0% of the Company’s shares outstanding.

The release of the second US$2 million tranche of funding is subject to the agreement of both parties, with funding to occur on a date no earlier than March 31, 2026. As part of this funding, both OIC and the holders of Existing Notes have agreed to partial payment in kind, in lieu of cash, for certain interest payments until July 2026 and a further deferral of the commencement of principal repayments to January 2027.

Program cancellations and important business update

As previously disclosed in the Company’s release of July 25, 2025, the Company has a number of new programs entering, or expected to enter, production in the near-term, however, as a result of a decline in the volume of wheels ordered or projected to be ordered by certain customers, the Company revised its revenue forecasts downward and slowed its initial short-term expansion plans.

The Company has continued to experience lower than expected demand for certain programs, especially those tied to the EV space. The weakening of the broader EV market has led to the early cancellation of two programs by a customer, which the Company had initially expected to contribute substantial wheel volumes. The Company is pursuing claims in relation to these cancelled programs.

In addition, as disclosed in the Company’s release of June 3, 2025, the Company is currently not in compliance with certain Nasdaq continued listing requirements. The Company has submitted a plan of compliance to Nasdaq where it has sought an extension in accordance with its plan and is waiting for Nasdaq’s determination. However, even if such plan is accepted, the Nasdaq staff only has the discretion to grant an exception for regaining compliance until November 26, 2025.

Notwithstanding the additional US$5 million of OIC funding announced today (and the expected release of a further US$2 million of OIC funding), the Company expects that it may need to obtain additional funding in the short term and is actively seeking other strategic alternatives to be completed within this fiscal year (ending June 30, 2026).

In order to obtain sufficient liquidity to fund its business and operations, the extent of which funding need is partially dependent upon the outcome of the customer claims being pursued by the Company mentioned above, as well as to contribute towards regaining compliance with Nasdaq continued listing requirements, the Company is exploring other potential strategic and financing options, a portion of which may need to be obtained significantly earlier than the end of the Company’s fiscal year. The Company makes no assurances that it will be able to secure any of the aforementioned on satisfactory terms, or at all.

This provides a unique opportunity to showcase Eos’ technology ahead of Frontier’s upcoming projects under Ofgem’s Cap-and-Floor program.

Frontier recently advanced 11 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of long-duration storage projects to the second round of the program, all incorporating Eos’ technology and more than double the original commitment. This milestone highlights the growing market demand for 8-hour-plus storage and reinforces confidence in the companies’ joint ability to deliver commercially viable, large-scale solutions.

“Our partnership with Eos goes beyond a single project – it’s about building a platform for long-duration storage at scale,” said Humza Malik, Frontier Chief Executive Officer. “Together, we’re demonstrating how innovative, safe, and sustainable zinc technology can support renewable growth and deliver dependable, flexible power for the grid of the future.”

Eos’ Z3™ technology builds on the company’s proven zinc-based chemistry, offering enhanced energy density, extended duration, and a safe, non-flammable solution ideal for long-life, grid-scale applications. As the partnership grows, Eos and Frontier are positioned to accelerate deployment of long-duration energy storage across key international markets, supporting renewable integration, grid stability, and global energy security.

The announcement coincides with the Company also achieving its final cash receipt milestone previously agreed upon between Eos and an affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management LP (Cerberus) as part of Cerberus’s strategic investment in the Company. No additional preferred stock or warrants will be issued to Cerberus at this time.

Geneva, Switzerland, Oct. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

SEALSQ Corp (NASDAQ: LAES) (""SEALSQ"" or ""Company""), a company that focuses on developing and selling Semiconductors, PKI, and Post-Quantum technology hardware and software products, today announced a new initiative leveraging the expertise of its subsidiary IC’Alps to develop integrated cybersecurity and functional safety solutions for the global automotive industry.

This initiative aims to position SEALSQ at the forefront of protecting next-generation autonomous and connected vehicles against emerging cybersecurity threats. Autonomous and software-defined vehicles are becoming highly interconnected digital platforms, relying on over-the-air (OTA) updates, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, and advanced sensor fusion capabilities. However, classical cryptographic systems, such as RSA and ECDSA, are vulnerable to future quantum computer attacks, which could compromise vehicle control systems, data integrity, navigation, and safety.

With autonomous vehicles becoming mission-critical systems, cybersecurity and functional safety must evolve together. SEALSQ plans to leverage its secure semiconductor technology in combination with the expertise of its subsidiary IC’Alps, a leader in custom ASIC design for safety-critical industries.

Because it is cheaper and always safer to prevent, rather than correct failure consequences, IC’Alps applies Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) as a core methodology to detect, mitigate, and prevent potential systematic failures as early as possible. As ASICs frequently power critical system functions in automotive, IC’Alps integrates DFMEA (Design FMEA) into its design strategy in full compliance with IATF 16949 and other safety-sensitive industry standards such as medical devices (ISO 13485) and aeronautics (AS 9100 / JISQ 9100 / EN 9100). This proactive approach aims to ensure reliability, quality, and long-term operational integrity.

Additionally, these processes can directly support customers targeting ISO 26262 certification and developing systems across ASIL-A to ASIL-D levels. FMEA is a cornerstone of the technical risk management process under IATF 16949, ensuring robustness in design and production by anticipating and preventing failures that could affect yield, reliability, and safety. IC’Alps has developed and continued to develop critical IP blocks and complete ASICs for demanding automotive applications for worldwide leading semiconductor players, and Tier 1 suppliers , up to ASIL certification.

With IC’Alps’ expertise in DFMEA, ASIC development rigor, and activities dealing with ISO 21434 (automotive cybersecurity), SEALSQ ensures its secure silicon meets the highest standards of both cybersecurity resilience and functional safety for the automotive industry.

Why Post-Quantum Security is Critical for Autonomous Vehicles

As vehicles evolve into fully connected, software-defined systems, cybersecurity is no longer optional, it is foundational to safety, reliability, and consumer trust. Post-quantum security represents the next frontier in protecting these intelligent platforms from emerging threats including:

Imminent quantum vulnerability: Classical encryption protecting vehicles today will be breakable by quantum computers.

Growing connectivity risks : Constant OTA and V2X interactions expand attack surfaces.

Future-proofing safety and trust: Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) implementation ensures long-term vehicle integrity and secure autonomy.

""The future of mobility must be secure by design, not only for today, but for the quantum era,"" said Carlos Moreira, Founder & CEO of SEALSQ. ""By combining SEALSQ’s post-quantum cybersecurity leadership with IC’Alps' world-class ASIC safety methodology, we aim to ensure autonomous vehicles remain protected, reliable, and trusted for decades ahead.""

About SEALSQ:

SEALSQ is a leading innovator in Post-Quantum Technology hardware and software solutions. Our technology seamlessly integrates Semiconductors, PKI (Public Key Infrastructure), and Provisioning Services, with a strategic emphasis on developing state-of-the-art Quantum Resistant Cryptography and Semiconductors designed to address the urgent security challenges posed by quantum computing. As quantum computers advance, traditional cryptographic methods like RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) are increasingly vulnerable.

SEALSQ is pioneering the development of Post-Quantum Semiconductors that provide robust, future-proof protection for sensitive data across a wide range of applications, including Multi-Factor Authentication tokens, Smart Energy, Medical and Healthcare Systems, Defense, IT Network Infrastructure, Automotive, and Industrial Automation and Control Systems.

America’s Fastest Growing Beer—American Rebel Light—and the NHRA continue to deliver a winning combination at the racetrack and on national TV, leveraging national sponsorships to transforming race-day fan passion into lifelong customer brand loyalty

Nashville, TN, Oct. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Rebel Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: AREB)—the unapologetically patriotic lifestyle brand behind American Rebel Light Beer ( www.americanrebelbeer.com ), America’s Patriotic, God-Fearing, Constitution-Loving, National Anthem-Singing, Stand Your Ground Beer —heads to Las Vegas with a full-throttle presence at the 25th Annual Dodge NHRA Nevada Nationals powered by Direct Connection , the fifth of six Countdown rounds (Oct. 30–Nov. 2). American Rebel is the primary sponsor with TSR Nitro for Matt Hagan’s Dodge//SRT Hellcat Funny Car and John Hall’s Buell Pro Stock Motorcycle, backed by national coverage on FS1 and full-weekend streaming on NHRA.TV .

For American Rebel Light Beer, NHRA weekends are more than exposure—they’re a connection with Americans who build, tune, race and drink what they love. The energy in the pits, on the track and captured on the national TV broadcast turns into real-world momentum at the shelf, accelerating distribution and fueling repeat purchase with a light lager built for clean, crisp refreshment.

“ NHRA weekends are where our brand meets America face-to-face. Teaming with TSR Nitro, John Hall and the NHRA on the sport’s biggest stages turns race day excitement into repeat purchase behavior. That’s the power of the American Rebel Brand with motorsports fans—one unmistakable combination that converts fans into lifelong customers of America’s Patriotic Beer, American Rebel Light,” said Andy Ross, CEO, American Rebel .

NHRA fans are hands-on, flag-forward, and fiercely loyal—people who keep their word and back brands that back America. That’s the American Rebel customer. When race fans pick up American Rebel Light, they’re not just reaching for another light beer; they’re choosing a beer that reflects their values and tastes—a beer that shows up where they show up, from the starting line to the checkout line. Motorsports like the NHRA + American Rebel Light Beer is the right partnership, in the right place, at exactly the right time.

Matt Hagan, Driver of the American Rebel Beer Dodge//SRT Hellcat Funny Car

Hagan rolls into The Strip at Las Vegas Motor Speedway as one of the defining forces of the Countdown— second in Funny Car, 112 points out of the lead , and on a track where he’s at his best: four Las Vegas wins and 11 career final rounds at this venue. Las Vegas marks Hagan’s 371st Funny Car start and 17th Nevada Nationals appearance —proof of a driver who knows how to channel the desert air into speed. “ Vegas is always big in the Countdown. The altitude can make power tricky, but our Dodge//SRT Hellcat has always responded here, ” Hagan said.

TSR Nitro’s two-car firepower sharpens the spear. Tony Stewart arrives sixth in Top Fuel , giving the organization a one-two punch as the championship chase tightens. Between them, the duo owns six combined wins at The Strip (Hagan with four)—and the experience to make every qualifying session count.

NHRA + American Rebel - America’s Patriotic Brand bring maximum horsepower

From Top Fuel to Funny Car to Pro Stock Motorcycle, American Rebel + NHRA is a natural fit: intense, authentic, and built for fans who show up early and stay until the last pair fires. That alignment is paying off. American Rebel Light Beer —a premium domestic light lager brewed without corn, rice, or added sweeteners —comes in at ~100 calories, 3.2g carbs, 4.3% ABV with a crisp, clean finish and lighter feel. Distribution now spans 15 states — AR, CT, FL, IN, IA, KS, KY, MN, MS, MO, NV, NC, OH, TN, VA —with chain activation growing as fast as the fanbase. The roar at the track becomes loyalty in the aisle.

It’s a formula that grows distribution, moves cases, and builds a community of lifelong fans and customers for American Rebel Light Beer.” — Andy Ross, CEO, American Rebel

John Hall and the American Rebel Pro Stock Motorcycle

John Hall brings serious momentum to Las Vegas on the American Rebel Beer Buell , with two national event victories this season—Norwalk and Reading heading into the Nevada Nationals.

Forward-Looking Statement

This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, but are not limited to, expectations regarding American Rebel Holdings, Inc.’s (“American Rebel” or the “Company”) future performance, distributor partnerships, market expansion, brand visibility, consumer demand, and shareholder value creation. Specifically, statements related to anticipated distribution growth, new market entries, potential distributor agreements, and strategic business development initiatives are forward-looking in nature.

Such statements are based on current assumptions, estimates, and projections about the Company’s business and industry, as well as management’s beliefs and expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. These risks include, but are not limited to: changes in consumer preferences and purchasing behavior; competitive pressures in the beverage industry; supply chain disruptions or production limitations; regulatory changes affecting distribution, labeling, or marketing; the Company’s ability to secure, maintain, or expand distributor and retail partnerships; the outcome and timing of contract negotiations; the success and availability of marketing and promotional activities; and the risks detailed in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2025.

Additionally, the Company appeared before a Nasdaq panel on September 30, 2025, to address its stockholder equity deficiency, which was not cured prior to the expiration of the 180-day extension in August 2025. Since June 30, 2025, the Company has initiated multiple transactions — including debt conversions, minority equity investments, and equity issuances — that were not reflected in its Q2 FY2025 Form 10-Q. Management believes these actions have collectively positioned the Company above the $2.5 million minimum stockholder equity threshold required by Nasdaq. However, the Company is currently awaiting the panel’s decision, which will be based upon both the Company’s presentation and the Nasdaq staff’s recommendations. There can be no assurance that the panel will concur with management’s position or render a favorable ruling.

Any forward-looking statement made herein speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Company to predict all of them.

The average balance of debt that finances the Company’s loan and investment portfolio for the third quarter of 2025 was $9.96 billion, as compared to $9.52 billion for the second quarter of 2025. The average cost of borrowings for the third quarter of 2025 was 7.02%, compared to 6.99% for the second quarter of 2025.

The Company completed a $1.05 billion collateralized securitization secured initially by a portfolio of real estate related assets and cash. Investment grade-rated notes totaling $933.2 million were issued, and the Company retained subordinate interests in the issuing vehicle of $116.8 million. The facility has a two and a half year asset replenishment period and an initial weighted average interest rate of 1.82% over term SOFR, excluding fees and transaction costs.

The Company issued $500.0 million of its 7.875% senior unsecured notes due July 2030 through a private offering. The Company is using the net proceeds of this offering to pay down debt and for general corporate purposes.

Researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have found an innovative way to turn everyday food waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Their new process, published in Nature Communications, could help the aviation industry achieve its net-zero emissions target by 2050.

The technique uses a method known as hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), which applies high heat and pressure to convert food waste into a thick biocrude oil—similar to how crude oil naturally forms underground. This biocrude is then cleaned and refined using hydrogen and catalysts to make it suitable for jet engines.

Dr. Sabrina Summers, lead researcher from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, explained that HTL can process various waste sources, including food scraps, animal manure, sewage sludge, and crop residues. This flexibility makes it ideal for creating renewable fuels from agricultural and industrial by-products.

After purification, the biocrude undergoes catalytic hydrotreating, which removes impurities such as nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. The team discovered that a cobalt molybdenum catalyst was the most efficient for refining the fuel. The final product passed all ASTM and FAA jet fuel standards—proving it can power aircraft without blending with fossil fuels.

Professor Yuanhui Zhang, who led the project, emphasized that the technology offers vast potential for scaling up. “Our research provides solutions to engineering challenges and opens doors for industries to commercialize sustainable aviation fuel,” Zhang said. He added that this innovation not only supports environmental goals but also strengthens economic development by turning waste into valuable resources.

This research demonstrates how circular bioeconomy principles can reshape industries by reusing waste, reducing pollution, and creating sustainable products for the future.

A revised framework would accelerate SAF deployment, strengthen competition, deliver genuine emissions reductions, and protect Europe’s essential air connectivity.","The European Regions Airline Association (ERA) has released a study, revealing that the uneven implementation of the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation is creating structural disadvantages for regional carriers and the destinations they serve.

The research shows that Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) supply is heavily concentrated at major hubs, leaving many smaller airports without access and exposing Europe’s most remote communities to rising costs, compliance burdens and reduced connectivity.

ERA’s airline CEOs stress that, while the sector is fully committed to achieving net-zero CO₂ emissions by 2050, ReFuelEU’s current rollout risks penalising smaller and regional airlines and isolating the communities they serve.

Montserrat Barriga, Director General of ERA said: “Europe’s green transition cannot come at the cost of territorial regional cohesion. If ReFuelEU continues on its current path, Europe risks seeing airlines go bankrupt and losing vital air connectivity.”

Under the Destination 2050 roadmap, SAF is expected to deliver the largest share of aviation’s emission reductions. ReFuelEU requires suppliers to blend increasing shares of SAF, starting at 2% in 2025 and rising to 70% by 2050.

However, ERA members report that early implementation is ‘fragmented and unfair’, pushing airlines to redesign their network and threatening the viability of some routes.

The order brings its total commitment for the A321neo to 280 aircraft.

Vietjet is already a large Airbus customer and A321neo operator. With its growing order book, the carrier will more than triple its fleet in the coming years. Meanwhile, Airbus continues to grow its backlog for the A320neo family, with over 7,100 A321neos ordered by nearly 100 customers as of September 30, 2025.

Vietjet Seals The Deal

The deal comes as Vietjet converted its Memorandum of Understanding with Airbus into a firm order for 100 A321neos. The MoU was signed at the Paris Air Show in June, marking a significant milestone for both companies. At the time of the agreement, Airbus reported that the carrier had options for an additional 50 aircraft. The finalization of the contract reflects Vietjet’s commitment to fleet modernization and network expansion.

The A321neo is the largest member of the A320neo family, offering longer range and more seating capacity. Airbus markets the aircraft as being 20% more fuel-efficient and 50% quieter than previous-generation single-aisle jets. As with the manufacturer’s other in-production aircraft, the A321neo is capable of operating with 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with a target to increase to 100% within the next five years. Speaking about the order, Vietjet Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao said:

“This is not merely a commercial contract, but a symbol of trust, aspiration, and a shared vision for sustainable development and global connectivity.”

Growing The Partnership With Airbus

The A321neo order follows Vietjet’s May 2025 order for 20 A330-900s. The contract doubled the airline’s firm orders for the A330neo to 40 aircraft. The new-generation widebody will allow the Vietnamese carrier to increase flights on high-capacity routes across Asia-Pacific and launch new long-haul routes to Europe. The A330-900 is the larger of the two A330neo variants.

Vietjet currently operates an Airbus-strong fleet, although it briefly leased a COMAC C909 for six months and took delivery of its first 737 MAX. Including aircraft operated by Vietjet Thailand and Vietjet Qazaqstan, the group has 121 aircraft, comprising A320-200s, A321-200s, A321neos, and A330-200s. The airline also has orders for over 400 aircraft, including the A321XLR and Boeing 737 MAX. Last month, Vietjet welcomed its latest Airbus A330, with registration VN-A820.

Vietjet flies to over 18 domestic destinations and 37 international destinations in the Asia-Pacific region. Its Airbus single-aisle jets are deployed to nearly 50 destinations, while the widebodies are deployed to seven destinations from Ho Chi Minh City. According to Cirium, an aviation analytics company, the top widebody route is from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi. The route sees up to 37 weekly flights. It is followed by Nha Trang to Hanoi with daily flights and Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh with five weekly flights. The top narrowbody route is also between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh with up to 117 weekly flights each way.

Growing The A320 Family Order Book

As of the end of September 2025, Airbus has received over 11,200 orders for the A320neo family, including 7,142 A321neos. The manufacturer has delivered 1,859 A321neos worldwide. Some of the largest customers include IndiGo and Wizz Air. Prior to the Vietjet deal, Airbus had received 289 A321neo orders in 2025, including 75 from Avolon, 55 from BOC Aviation, and 40 from United Airlines.

In total, the company has received orders for 610 aircraft and delivered 507 to 79 customers in 2025. Airbus is aiming to deliver 820 aircraft this year. The company would have to deliver an average of 104 aircraft each month for the remaining quarter to meet this target. By the end of September 2024, it had delivered 497 aircraft, while chasing a lower revised target of 770 aircraft.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_2544328827-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-31 08:56:14.147056

This report examines the transition from waste oils to next-generation fuels, assessing the scaling of renewable diesel, SAF, ethanol, and biodiesel alongside the emergence of synthetic fuels, ammonia, and methanol, and highlighting the feedstock shift toward residues and algae as the sector looks beyond 2030.

Global transport is under pressure to decarbonize, with heavy-duty vehicles, aviation, and shipping proving difficult to electrify. This report explores how alternative fuels are scaling, from today's reliance on renewable diesel, SAF, ethanol, and FAME biodiesel to tomorrow's frontier solutions, such as synthetic fuels, green and blue ammonia, and green and blue methanol.

Backed by mandates such as the EU ReFuelEU Aviation regulation and IMO's 2050 decarbonization targets, low-carbon fuels are attracting investment and corporate commitments from leaders like Maersk, Finnair, and United Airlines. Yet sustainability constraints on waste oils are driving a feedstock transition toward residues, MSW, and algae, with commercial availability still a decade away. This report offers critical insights into technology pathways, policy frameworks, and market opportunities shaping the future of low-carbon fuels.

Key Highlights

Transport emissions are projected to reach 8,019 MtCO? by 2030, with heavy truck emissions having risen at a 2.3% CAGR between 2000 and 2020, underscoring the urgency of diversifying decarbonization pathways.

Renewable diesel (RD) capacity is forecast to grow at a 16% CAGR between 2025 and 2030, with North America leading the way, followed by Europe and Asia.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is set to expand at a faster 36% CAGR over 2025-2030, supported by the EU's ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandating a 6% SAF blend by 2030 and voluntary airline commitments, such as United Airlines targeting 10% SAF by 2030.

Innovation in synthetic fuels, ammonia, and methanol is advancing, with shipping already leading methanol adoption, for example Maersk has over 25 methanol-fueled vessels on order, backed by offtake agreements with producers such as Orsted and Methanex.

The feedstock transition is underway: current reliance on waste lipids (animal fats, used cooking oil, vegetable oils) is constrained, driving investment in lignocellulosic residues, MSW-to-fuel, and algae, which offer scalability, circularity, and significant lifecycle emission reductions.

The ReFuelEU Aviation Annual Technical Report found that 0.6% of Europe’s supplied aviation fuel for 2024 was SAF. This percentage needs to increase rapidly, but nevertheless saved 714 kilotonnes of carbon emissions, the equivalent of around 10,000 flights between Madrid and Paris.

Overall, EASA believes the EU is on track to achieve its 6% blending target in the next five years. Whether the bloc hits its interim target of 2% SAF in 2025 will be assessed at the close of this calendar year.

China is Europe’s biggest supplier of biofuel

EASA’s findings also highlight the ongoing cost obstacles to SAF adoption. Currently, the average price of SAF sits at €2,085/tonne, compared to €734/tonne for conventional jet fuel. Until the cost becomes more competitive, it is difficult to see how SAF use can scale successfully. Earlier this year, Airlines for Europe (A4E) criticised the EU for imposing SAF mandates without taking action to create a viable SAF market. Nevertheless, EASA’s report affirms progress on the 6% target.

Europe’s biggest producer of SAF is currently Finland, responsible for 10% of supply. However, 69% of feedstock originates outside of the EU, with China the biggest supplier.

Maria Rueda, EASA’s safety management, sustainability and global outreach director, said:

This first annual technical report marks an important milestone and makes clear that the EU has taken important first steps.

A functioning reporting system is now in place, initial reporting compliance levels are solid, and SAF delivery is happening across multiple member states. This report sets an important benchmark for our sustainability efforts in the future.

The team converted food waste into biocrude oil through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), which can process feedstock from a wide range of biowaste, including food, sewage sludge, algal bloom, swine manure, and agricultural residue. Next, they remove impurities from the biocrude oil and then they refine it with the use of hydrogen and catalysts to turn it into aviation fuel. They said this approach can be applied to a variety of feedstocks and types of oil, potentially leading to a new direction for obtaining fuels.

The process is detailed in Nature Communications and could help the aviation industry meet its 2050 net-zero ambition.

“HTL basically mimics the natural formation of crude oil in the Earth. It uses high heat and pressure to convert wet biomass into a biocrude oil. The goal of this work is to upgrade that biocrude oil into transportation fuels that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure,” said lead author Sabrina Summers, who recently graduated with a doctoral degree from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE).

For this project, the researchers used waste from a food processing facility. Globally, over 30 per cent of food is wasted annually at all levels of the supply chain, from farm to transportation, processing, retail, food service, and households. Food decomposition in landfills and wastewater treatment plants further contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.

“To meet the aviation industry’s goals to decarbonate jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,” said ABE professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang.

To convert biocrude oil into jet fuel, the researchers first removed impurities such as moisture, ash, and salt. They then used catalytic hydrotreating to eliminate unwanted elements like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulphur, leaving behind the hydrocarbons needed for fuel.

After testing dozens of options, they identified cobalt molybdenum as the most effective commercially available catalyst to drive the necessary chemical reactions and refine the oil into sustainable aviation fuel.

To optimise the hydrotreatment process, the researchers adjusted variables such as temperature, catalyst and hydrogen loads, and retention time to identify the best conditions for producing jet fuel.

They then tested their sustainable aviation fuel against standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the US Federal Aviation Administration. Their SAF sample is said to have passed Tier Alpha and Beta pre-screening tests and met all specifications for conventional jet fuel without requiring additives or blending with fossil fuels.

The technology has the potential to be scaled up for commercial production, Zhang said.

“Our research helps solve the science and engineering problems, and then the industry can step in. The process can be applied to other types of oils for SAF. It can also replace other materials, such as petroleum-derived compounds for making plastics. This has huge potential for business opportunities and economic development,” he said",https://s44864.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sabrina20ummers.webp,N,,2025-10-31 05:56:25.902326

Air India’s progressive steps under his leadership underscore how Indian companies can responsibly innovate while contributing to national and global environmental goals.","Dr. Nilay Ranjan’s professional journey spans over two decades across government, non-profit, and corporate sectors, powered by a dedication to sustainability and social responsibility.

Since joining Air India Limited as Head of Sustainability and CSR in September 2024, he has been instrumental in driving the airline’s transition towards greener operations.

Under his leadership, Air India signed a game-changing MoU with Indian Oil Corporation in 2025 for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) supply, part of India’s ambition to achieve 5% SAF blending by 2030 and align with global net zero objectives.

“Sustainability is not a separate agenda; it’s core to future business viability,” Dr. Ranjan asserts. This piece traces his career journey, his impact at Air India, and the broader implications for India’s clean aviation future.

From Rural Development to Corporate Leadership

Before emerging as a CSR leader, Dr. Nilay Ranjan cut his teeth as a Rural Development and Convergence Expert with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), working on government flagship rural employment initiatives such as MGNREGS.

His foundational work in rural convergence and policy formulation laid the groundwork for his systemic understanding of sustainable development challenges in India. Dr. Ranjan himself notes, “My time in rural development ingrained the importance of inclusive growth and multi-stakeholder collaboration.”

With a PhD in International Relations from Jawaharlal Nehru University and executive education from the Indian School of Business, he transitioned into corporate CSR at Idea Cellular Ltd (later Vodafone Idea), where he oversaw CSR strategies for education, health, livelihood, and environmental initiatives.

His role evolved into managing ESG frameworks and a diversified grant portfolio covering over 24 NGOs before shifting to lead Education programs at Reliance Foundation. At every stage, his approach was anchored in aligning corporate goals with social impact, reflecting a balance of empathy and pragmatism.

Leading Air India’s Green Transformation

Dr. Ranjan took the helm of Air India’s Sustainability and CSR division at a time when the aviation sector faced increasing pressure for climate accountability.

His leadership crystallised in the August 2025 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Indian Oil Corporation, pioneering the supply of ISCC-certified Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) derived primarily from waste cooking oil and bio-waste at Indian Oil’s Panipat refinery.

This SAF partnership underpins India’s policy to blend 5% of sustainable fuel by 2030, positioning Air India at the forefront of India’s decarbonisation efforts and aligning with International Civil Aviation Organization’s CORSIA program to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

Complementing the fuel transition are operational efficiencies through digital tech adoption Air India has implemented SITA OptiFlight and eWAS systems, which optimise flight routing to cut fuel burn and reduce approximately 35,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.

Additionally, the airline is renewing its fleet with the acquisition of 570 new aircraft, all focused on enhancing fuel efficiency and lowering environmental impact.

Dr. Ranjan comments: “Sustainability in aviation demands an integrated approach fuel, technology, fleet, and people.” His push emphasises systematic transformation rather than isolated measures.

Multi-Stakeholder Approach for Holistic Impact

Dr. Nilay Ranjan’s unique strength lies in bridging sectors and perspectives. Air India’s CSR and sustainability thrust under his guidance includes not only fuel and tech innovation but also advocacy and community development.

Employee engagement programs foster sustainability awareness inside the organisation, while procurement policies prioritise eco-friendly vendors. Beyond the airline, Dr. Ranjan spearheads CSR projects in education, skill empowerment, and environmental stewardship inspired by his tenure at Reliance Foundation.

His philosophy is deeply systemic: “True sustainability thrives when we create shared value across environmental, social, and economic dimensions, rather than fragmented efforts.”

Air India’s inclusive sustainability narrative passionately involves government regulators, corporate partners, civil society, and local communities building a coalition for transformative, long-term impact.

The Logical Indian’s Perspective

Dr. Nilay Ranjan’s journey exemplifies the power of expertise, commitment, and ethical governance in corporate sustainability. Air India’s progressive steps under his leadership underscore how Indian companies can responsibly innovate while contributing to national and global environmental goals.

This story is a clarion call for more organisations to embed sustainability as a business imperative, not just a compliance mechanism.

The Logical Indian believes that such leadership inspires vital conversations around the intersection of economic growth and environmental preservation.

Utilisation rates compound the problem: existing plants operated at just 24% in 2024, leaving 3 million tonnes idle due to limited feedstock and weak demand.
For every tonne of fossil jet fuel replaced, another tonne will be added through expanded flying.","Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has become aviation’s favourite headline act in the race to net zero. Airlines trumpet offtake deals, airports celebrate the first SAF refuelling, and energy majors showcase refinery conversions. But behind the marketing gloss lies a sobering statistic: even under the most optimistic assumptions, SAF will replace only about 5% of global jet fuel use by 2030

Carbon Tracker’s Fuel Disclosure report shows that while global aviation emissions have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, actual production of alternative jet fuel remains negligible, just 1 million tonnes in 2024, or 0.3% of total jet fuel consumption.

Offtake commitments

Airlines have signed a wave of offtake agreements, but these commitments still cover less than 2% of potential 2030 consumption. Many of them are non-binding memoranda or letters of intent. Even if fulfilled, they will displace only a sliver of fossil jet fuel.

Carbon Tracker’s analysis of 54 million tonnes of such deals between 2020 and 2024 found that half the volume under non-binding agreements was delivered, but the rest remains uncertain.

The report describes a “chicken-and-egg” dynamic: offtakers are hesitant to sign long-term agreements, while producers are unwilling or unable to expand capacity without them.

Capacity projections fall short

Even factoring in every planned project globally, total SAF capacity is expected to reach 18 million tonnes by 2030, which is less than 5% of the anticipated jet fuel demand.

Utilisation rates compound the problem: existing plants operated at just 24% in 2024, leaving 3 million tonnes idle due to limited feedstock and weak demand.

In realistic terms, assuming 80% utilisation, all projects combined would supply about 13.5 million tonnes, meeting only 17–30% of additional fuel demand expected from traffic growth. For every tonne of fossil jet fuel replaced, another tonne will be added through expanded flying.

A price problem that won’t go away

Even as production ramps up, cost remains a formidable barrier. HEFA-based fuels, which dominate 82% of SAF output, sold for $1,800–2,780 per tonne in 2025, more than double fossil kerosene’s $715 average.

Feedstock costs account for up to 90% of production expenses, and the limited supply of used cooking oil or animal fats is pushing prices higher.

Without large-scale subsidies or carbon pricing, the premium of SAF will continue to deter adoption. Airlines with slim margins—fuel already represents about 25% of operating costs—cannot absorb these increases indefinitely.

What it means for the Middle East

Gulf carriers operate some of the world’s densest long-haul networks. These routes rely on high-energy fuels, where SAF substitution matters most but is the most challenging to achieve.

With global supply centred in Europe and North America, regional airlines face a procurement challenge. Unless local production emerges, the Middle East risks paying a premium for imported SAF or falling behind in sustainability metrics as EU and UK mandates tighten.

The region’s oil majors, including ADNOC, ENOC, and Aramco, are beginning to explore SAF refining and e-fuel ventures, but most are still at the pilot scale. The window to secure feedstock and technology partnerships is narrowing fast.

Carbon Tracker concludes that while truly sustainable alternative jet fuel will play a role in decarbonising aviation, “it may power a portion of long-haul flights but is unlikely to scale sufficiently to make a significant dent in aviation emissions.” For Middle East aviation leaders, the message is clear: investing early in synthetic fuels, hydrogen, and efficiency technologies will be crucial to hedge against a coming supply crunch.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/10/31/sean-wang-UzFwyYIB84Q-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 05:56:35.215463

Next, they remove impurities from the biocrude oil and then they refine it with the use of hydrogen and catalysts to turn it into aviation fuel. They said this approach can be applied to a variety of feedstocks and types of oil, potentially leading to a new direction for obtaining fuels.

The process is detailed in Nature Communications and could help the aviation industry meet its 2050 net-zero ambition.

“HTL basically mimics the natural formation of crude oil in the Earth. It uses high heat and pressure to convert wet biomass into a biocrude oil. The goal of this work is to upgrade that biocrude oil into transportation fuels that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure,” said lead author Sabrina Summers, who recently graduated with a doctoral degree from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE).

For this project, the researchers used waste from a food processing facility. Globally, over 30 per cent of food is wasted annually at all levels of the supply chain, from farm to transportation, processing, retail, food service, and households. Food decomposition in landfills and wastewater treatment plants further contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.

“To meet the aviation industry’s goals to decarbonate jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,” said ABE professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang.

To convert biocrude oil into jet fuel, the researchers first removed impurities such as moisture, ash, and salt. They then used catalytic hydrotreating to eliminate unwanted elements like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulphur, leaving behind the hydrocarbons needed for fuel.

After testing dozens of options, they identified cobalt molybdenum as the most effective commercially available catalyst to drive the necessary chemical reactions and refine the oil into sustainable aviation fuel.

To optimise the hydrotreatment process, the researchers adjusted variables such as temperature, catalyst and hydrogen loads, and retention time to identify the best conditions for producing jet fuel.

They then tested their sustainable aviation fuel against standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the US Federal Aviation Administration. Their SAF sample is said to have passed Tier Alpha and Beta pre-screening tests and met all specifications for conventional jet fuel without requiring additives or blending with fossil fuels.

The technology has the potential to be scaled up for commercial production, Zhang said.

“Our research helps solve the science and engineering problems, and then the industry can step in. The process can be applied to other types of oils for SAF. It can also replace other materials, such as petroleum-derived compounds for making plastics. This has huge potential for business opportunities and economic development,” he said.",https://www.theengineer.co.uk/media/3vxoowan/sabrina20ummers.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 05:56:52.943423

At the launch, Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said he looked forward to a “substantial outcome” by the next Apec Summit.

Topics to be considered under the Gepa include new environmental goods such as sustainable aviation fuel; non-physical environmental goods such as carbon credits; and trade-related climate measures.

These were recommended by officials from the three countries after several rounds of discussions, under a joint working group on trade and the green economy established in November 2024.

The aim is to set common rules and standards in these areas, said PM Wong. In doing so, the Gepa will modernise trade and investment policies to support the flows of such goods and services, lowering barriers to trade while accelerating the green transition.

It will also unlock opportunities in the green economy for companies and create good jobs, he added.

Collaborative spirit

“In the past, we have tended to see growth and sustainability as competing priorities,” said PM Wong in his speech at the launch. “But technological breakthroughs have challenged this assumption.”

Green energy sources are becoming viable alternatives to fossil fuels, and capital is flowing into low-carbon and energy-efficient solutions – showing that growth and sustainability can be mutually reinforcing, he said.

“Trade can facilitate our collective green transition, by facilitating cross-border flows of the goods, services, technologies and finance that enable it.”

New Zealand PM Christopher Luxon said that as the rapid pace of global regulatory change creates more complexity for businesses, countries must work together to help reduce the burden of compliance, with greater cooperation and coordination.

Pioneering partners

“Singapore is proud to partner Chile and New Zealand in this endeavour,” said PM Wong. “We may be three small countries, but we have a proven track record of pioneering innovative agreements together.”

He cited how the three countries and Brunei started the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership, which evolved into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.

The three countries also started the “first-of-its-kind plurilateral Digital Economy Partnership Agreement”, he added. “This continues to receive interest from other aspiring economies – a sign of the value which others see in it.”

Highlighting that the three countries are like-minded partners in sustainability efforts, Chile President Gabriel Boric flagged the value of the agreement as an example, saying: “I know other countries are looking to what we are doing.”

PM Wong encouraged the officials to be bold in developing the Gepa, and “look beyond conventional approaches, embrace new ideas, and draw on private-sector insights”.

“I am confident that by joining hands, we can turn trade into a force for good, catalysing economic growth while doing our part for the environment and global climate action.”

(“XCF”) (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”), today shared its perspective on the rapidly evolving global policy landscape shaping the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel.

The scale of the challenge – and opportunity – is immense. According to the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”), airlines will need approximately 165 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2050 to achieve net-zero emissions. In 2024, global SAF production totalled only ~330 million gallons – about 0.3% of total jet-fuel demand. Meeting 2050 decarbonization targets will require an estimated 27% compound annual growth rate in production capacity and the construction of 5,000 – 7,000 new facilities worldwide. This gap represents one of the most compelling growth opportunities in the global energy transition, with analysts projecting the SAF market could exceed ~$25 billion by 2030 and reach ~$270 billion by 2050.

Governments are responding. Across major markets, policymakers are using mandates and incentive schemes to accelerate SAF adoption. Today, more than 2 billion people globally live in countries with SAF blending mandates or strong incentives, such as tax credits – by 2030, this number is expected to grow to more than 4 billion people.

In the U.S., the SAF Grand Challenge aims to expand domestic consumption of SAF to 3 billion gallons per year by 2030 and 35 billion gallons per year by 2050.

In Europe,the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates that SAF make up 2% of all jet fuel by 2025, rising to 6% in 2030, 20% by 2035, and 70% by 2050, creating one of the largest mandated clean-fuel markets globally.

The UK has coupled mandates starting from 2% in 2025 and increasing to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040 with revenue-certainty mechanisms that help cover the price premium between SAF and conventional jet fuel.

Across Asia-Pacific, countries including Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea, and Singapore are developing frameworks that combine blending targets, tax incentives, and infrastructure funding to stimulate both production and demand.

“Global demand for SAF is shifting from ‘if’ to ‘how fast,’” said Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF. “Mandates, incentives, and procurement are converging to drive volume. These dynamics underscore the value of XCF’s early-mover advantage and modular design, which we’re now extending globally through partnerships such as with New Rise Australia, a venture that is expected to develop three SAF sites across the continent to meet Australia’s growing demand for sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.”

XCF highlighted three dynamics that will shape the next phase of growth:

Diverse toolkits, common direction. Regions may use different policy levers – mandates, subsidies, tax credits, or procurement – but they all point toward accelerating adoption.

Technology mix evolution. HEFA remains the dominant pathway in the near-term, while policy frameworks are creating headroom for emerging pathways to scale toward 2050 targets.

System reliability. Airlines and fuel suppliers need dependable volumes, transparent carbon accounting, and logistics that work across borders. Producers with operational capacity and credible expansion plans will lead.

“As SAF adoption transitions from pilot programs to long-term supply, reliability and verifiability become the new currency of trust,” Dange added. “XCF is building the backbone of that transition by advancing the infrastructure and partnerships needed to make SAF the new standard across global aviation.”

Here are my priorities for the 2026 Port of Seattle budget this year.

Strengthening pathways to workforce development programs for English Speakers of Other Language (ESOL)

I am proud of our state’s diversity and here in King County, data tells us that nearly 25% of our population are foreign-born. My staff and I learned that with this rich diversity, access to English language classes have long wait lists in order to gain the language proficiency to enter workforce development pathways for aviation and maritime industries. This is why I am supporting resources for English Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) pathways as one way to address workforce shortages reported by industry partners.

Continued support for Maritime High School operations

Maritime High School graduated its inaugural class in June. That is an exciting benchmark and testament to this innovative approach to high school education. I believe supporting Maritime provides options for young people who leave the classroom with industry credentials and ready to enter the maritime workforce upon graduation or go on to continue their education at post-secondary institutions. Whatever choice these young people make, it is an investment in them and a win for the maritime workforce.

A summit on sustainable maritime fuels convened by the Port of Seattle

The Port of Seattle is deeply committed to sustainability and climate action, detailed in our Century Agenda goal of becoming the greenest port in North America. Working with many different partners across public and private sectors, we have helped grow the conversation and ecosystem for sustainable aviation fuel. Now we are looking to do the same for sustainable maritime fuels by bringing together thought leaders across the many sectors with a summit to build pathways and relationships toward collective action.

Growing shipbuilding readiness as an economic development strategy for Washington state

Washington state has a strong shipbuilding legacy, but the industry has been shrinking for decades. The opportunity is ripe to reinvigorate the industry while also introducing advanced technologies to build low-emission and zero-emission vessels that can power trade and transport for decades to come.

Community-focused activations

With the refurbished and reactivated Seattle waterfront, we have an opportunity to say thank you to community members for their support in building a truly world-class public space, stretching from Pioneer Square to Interbay. I have requested resources to support increased activation to deepen the connection to our maritime heritage, our waterfront, and our being a port city with local residents and communities next summer, as we host the World Cup and also celebrate the 250th anniversary of our nation’s founding.

Reducing those emissions and otherwise making jet travel more sustainable is critical.

Aviation companies, both large and small, are responding with green initiatives. Understanding what they are can help you find the right partner for your next flight.

The Environmental Impact of Aviation

All forms of travel can have an impact on the environment, but flight is a major offender. Private flights, in particular, are harmful.

Researchers say private jets are 5 to 14 times more polluting than commercial planes. In one study of data from 2023, researchers found that private flights contributed at least 15.6 Mt CO2 in direct emissions.

This problem isn’t fading, as more people are using private flights. In the UK alone in 2022, private jets took off an average of once every six minutes.

Industry Commitments to Sustainability

Air transport professionals understand that their work can lead to environmental damage. They’re responding in significant ways.

For example, in 2021, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) passed a resolution committing its member airlines to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Similarly, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) was developed as a global measure that’s designed to limit carbon emissions from international flights.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

One important contribution to green aviation involves the development of new forms of fuel. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is made from feedstocks instead of fossil fuels, and it can be used to power all sorts of aircraft.

According to data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 24.5 million gallons of SAF were consumed in 2023.

United Airlines is one such customer. Less than 1% of their overall fuel consumption is SAF, but the company hopes to use more in the future.

Carbon Offset Programs

Carbon offsetting involves investing in carbon reduction projects to compensate for the carbon emissions associated with the flight. The IATA says more than 50 airlines use programs like this.

Offsets don’t reduce emissions directly. However, they can help other programs to grow, which could reduce the impact of a flight.

Innovations in Aircraft Technology

Changes in technology can also help mitigate the environmental impact of flights. Current changes include the following:

Electric- and hydrogen-powered aircraft

Lightweight materials for plane construction

Advanced aerodynamic designs for aircraft

Improved engine fuel efficiency

Optimized flight operation

Airlines Leading the Green Initiative

Major airlines are examining the data and making changes to their operations and programs. These are a few of the companies embracing green technology:

United Airlines

United Airlines has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Importantly, they’re trying to accomplish this goal without using carbon offsets.

United Airlines is using efficient aircraft, trying sustainable fuels, and collaborating with partners to help them streamline their operations.

JetBlue Airways

JetBlue Airways is working hard to achieve carbon-neutral status for all domestic flights. They’re also looking at incorporating new sustainability initiatives.

Initiatives include reusing materials, trying new fuels, and investing in sustainable aircraft startups.

Emirates

Emirates has invested in new aircraft, and the company claims to have one of the youngest fleets in the industry. All of the aircraft meet emission standards.

Emirates also uses flight-planning systems to ensure their routes are optimized and don’t need too much fuel. The company also uses alternate fuels on some flights.

Harbour Air

Harbour Air is the first carbon-neutral airline. The company uses a combination of carbon offsets, new fuels, and on-the-ground optimizations to ensure they don’t use more fuel than needed. They also partner with companies like Ostrom Climate to continue to innovate.

Charter Operators Embracing Sustainability

Jet charter companies are integrating sustainable practices into their operations. Each company is doing something a little different, but the result can include optimized flights and a reduced level of emissions.

Wheels Up

Private company Wheels Up has launched a SAF program. Customers can choose this option for their flights when booking, ensuring they take direct action against climate change.

VistaJet

Private company VistaJet has taken many steps toward sustainability. Those steps include the following:

Maximizing their fleet use

Adding new aircraft with high environmental ratings

Using carbon offsets

Advocating for SAF

JetLevel Aviation

JetLevel Aviation has committed to fleet modernization, focusing on acquiring aircraft equipped with reduced emissions technology. The company also partners with operators who prioritize eco-friendly flying.

Challenges & the Road Ahead

While airline operators are doing their part to reduce the impact of flights on the environment, more work must be done. After all, these steps just reduce emissions without eliminating them.

Companies must continue to innovate and grow, looking for new ways to use fuels that are eco-friendly. Consumers must also demand change from their operators to ensure they keep the environment in mind.

How You Can Contribute

As a consumer, it’s critical to choose partners with robust sustainability programs. If you find a company like this, be willing to pay a little more for your flights. This small increase in price could entice the company to further embrace the work.

You can also pay close attention to changes in green innovation. Instead of accepting simple carbon offsets, look for ways to support new aircraft and fuels.

(Chambana Today) — Scientists at the U of I have developed a breakthrough method to transform food waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that meets industry standards without blending fossil fuels. The new process, published in Nature Communications, could help the aviation industry achieve its goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The research team used a process called hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) to convert food waste into biocrude oil, which was then refined into jet fuel using hydrogen and catalysts.

“HTL basically mimics the natural formation of crude oil in the Earth. It uses high heat and pressure to convert wet biomass into a biocrude oil. The goal of this work is to upgrade that biocrude oil into transportation fuels that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure,” said lead author Sabrina Summers, a recent doctoral graduate in Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE).

The researchers sourced food waste from a nearby processing facility, but the process can also use sewage sludge, algal blooms, swine manure, and agricultural residue.

“To meet the aviation industry’s goals to decarbonate jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,” said ABE professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang.

After refining the biocrude oil and removing impurities, the team’s fuel passed all American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) prescreening tests for conventional jet fuel.

Zhang said the discovery could open the door to large-scale production and new economic opportunities. “Our research helps solve the science and engineering problems, and then the industry can step in. The process can be applied to other types of oils for SAF. It can also replace other materials, such as petroleum-derived compounds for making plastics. This has huge potential for business opportunities and economic development,” he said.

The project also supports a “circular bioeconomy,” Zhang added. “In a linear economy, we just produce something, use it, and throw it away. In this project, we take the waste and recover the energy and materials to make a usable product. This fills a missing link in the circular paradigm,” he said.

30 October 2025

Appoints seasoned industry leader as founding Chief Executive Officer

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has set up the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company Ltd. (SAFCo) to centrally procure sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for the Singapore air hub and support the implementation of Singapore’s national SAF policy. SAFCo is set up as a non-profit Company Limited by Guarantee wholly owned by CAAS. Mr Han Kok Juan, Director-General of CAAS, will chair SAFCo’s Board. Ms Tan Seow Hui, a seasoned leader in the energy and aviation industries, has been appointed as its founding Chief Executive Officer (see Annex A for Ms Tan’s curriculum vitae).

2 The setting up of SAFCo follows the passing of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (Amendment) Bill in Parliament on 14 October 2025, which allows for the implementation of SAF policies for air transport in Singapore and empowers CAAS to collect a SAF Levy, to set up a SAF Fund and to procure, manage and allocate SAF and SAF environmental attributes (EAs)1 or to establish and appoint a central procurement entity to carry out these functions. More details on the SAF Levy amounts will be shared later.

3 Through SAFCo, CAAS seeks to build a transparent and integrated SAF demand market that brings together airlines, corporate buyers of SAF, fuel producers, carbon market platforms2 and stakeholders across the aviation fuel chain in Singapore to aggregate demand, stimulate investment and accelerate the use of SAF:

a) SAFCo will centrally procure SAF using the SAF Fund to achieve the 1% SAF target in 2026, for flights departing Singapore. The amount of SAF procured by SAFCo will increase accordingly when the SAF target is raised to 3–5% by 2030, subject to global developments and the wider availability and adoption of SAF. SAF and SAF EAs will be sourced through a transparent competitive tender process from SAF suppliers that meet international sustainability standards like CORSIA. With predictable cashflows from the SAF Levy, SAFCo will be able to go into longer-term, competitive price agreements to secure a more stable and affordable SAF supply.

b) Beyond the regulated demand from the SAF Levy, SAFCo will also aggregate voluntary SAF demand from organisations seeking to purchase SAF to reduce their air travel or supply chain carbon footprint credibly and cost-effectively. The demand from the SAF Levy forms a scalable baseload, enabling SAFCo to negotiate attractive pricing for SAF and SAF EAs, and to anchor long-term supply agreements. Businesses that participate in SAFCo’s voluntary SAF purchases can leverage this baseload to unlock economies of scale. They can also gain access to competitively priced and verified SAF and SAF EAs through SAFCo and avoid the need to set up their own procurement systems.

4 As a new entity, SAFCo’s immediate priorities will be to establish robust governance and procurement frameworks, set up levy collection systems and processes and build manpower and procurement capability, while engaging stakeholders on the implementation, ahead of the first SAF procurement in 2026. SAFCo will also build a scalable voluntary demand programme for SAF and SAF EAs as a complement to the SAF Levy. SAFCo will reach out to businesses and airlines to encourage them to partner SAFCo and use its central procurement mechanism for voluntary SAF purchases. Conversations are ongoing; SAFCo will provide more details on the side of the Singapore Airshow in February next year. Interested businesses and airlines are encouraged to reach out to SAFCo at safcoadmin@safco.com.sg.

5 SAFCo will also support the development of the SAF supply ecosystem in Singapore and the region. With predictable and stable cashflows, SAFCo can sign longer and larger contracts with SAF suppliers, providing demand certainty in a still nascent SAF market. This approach aims to encourage investment in SAF production capacity and the development of SAF-related carbon markets in Singapore and the region.

6 Mr Han Kok Juan, Director-General, CAAS and Chairman of SAFCo said, “Singapore is taking a pragmatic, balanced and action-oriented approach to advancing sustainability in the aviation sector. The setting up of SAFCo is another concrete step forward. Through SAFCo, we want to get the best value for the SAF Levy collected and activate a SAF ecosystem which will help advance sustainable aviation and create new economic opportunities for Singapore and beyond.”

7 Ms Tan Seow Hui, Chief Executive Officer of SAFCo said, “I am honoured to lead SAFCo at this pivotal stage. My priority will be to put in place credible and scalable frameworks, partnerships and processes to ensure that SAFCo delivers on its mandate to aggregate demand, procure SAF efficiently, and manage SAF EAs transparently. By working closely with airlines, businesses and suppliers, we aim to facilitate greater SAF adoption in the region and contribute to the decarbonisation of aviation.”

1 SAF environmental attributes is a value representing the difference in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of SAF throughout its life cycle and those of the same quantity of conventional aviation fuel throughout its life cycle. SAF environmental attributes may be used by a person to meet offsetting requirements applicable to that person under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization or other similar programmes, or reported by a person as carbon emissions reduction from the use of SAF under any scheme applicable to or adopted by that person for the reporting of environmental sustainability efforts undertaken by that person to stakeholders or investors of that person or regulators of the business of that person.

2 Carbon market platforms are digital marketplaces that facilitate the trading of carbon, SAF or other sustainability credits.
