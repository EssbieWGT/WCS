2025-03-04 12:03:21+00:00,Nature,Assessing airline communication for voluntary carbon offsets - npj Sustainable Mobility and Transport,"Airlines offer voluntary carbon offsetting (VCO) programmes in response to growing climate action demands. However, these programmes face scrutiny over potential greenwashing in communication. This study uses a two-step approach to examine the communication practices of 32 airlines across Asia, Europe, and North America. The content analysis assesses accessibility, transparency, and flexibility in communications, focusing on emphasizing not just the content but also how easily travellers can find, understand, and engage with VCO information. The interpretive analysis identifies misleading practices. Findings reveal diverse practices, regional variations, and differing transparency levels. While some airlines provide detailed communication, others use misleading tactics such as vagueness and selective disclosure. Notably, a third of the airlines did not offer VCO programmes, with many shifting towards sustainable aviation fuels. The results underscore the need for standardized regulations for VCO communication to enable travellers to make informed decisions in the evolving landscape of airline environmental responsibility.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs44333-025-00027-7/MediaObjects/44333_2025_27_Fig1_HTML.png,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44333-025-00027-7,2025-03-04 12:00:03.472635

2025-03-01 03:27:28+00:00,bioRxiv,Evolution guided tolerance engineering of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 for production of the sustainable aviation fuel precursor isoprenol,"Isoprenol (3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol) is a sustainable aviation fuel precursor and commodity chemical which can be microbially synthesized from renewable carbon streams. Its production has been demonstrated in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 but its titers, rates, and yields have yet to reach commercially viable levels, potentially due to its inherent toxicity. We hypothesized that utilization of Tolerization Adaptive Laboratory Evolution (TALE) would generate P. putida hosts more tolerant to isoprenol and suitable for enhanced production phenotypes. Here, we performed a comprehensive TALE campaign using three strains, the wild-type and two strains lacking subsets of known isoprenol catabolism and transport functions in quadruplicate independently evolved lineages. Several evolved clones from each starting strain displayed robust growth (up to 0.2 h-1) at 8 g/L of isoprenol, where starting strains could not grow. Whole genome resequencing of the 12 independent strain lineages identified convergent mutations. Reverse engineering four commonly mutated regions individually ( gnuR , ttgB -PP\_1394, PP\_3024-PP\_5558, PP\_1695) each resulted in a partial recovery of the tolerance phenotypes observed in the evolved strains. Additionally, a proteomics-guided deletion of the master motility regulator, fleQ , in an evolved clone alleviated the tolerance vs. production trade-off, restoring isoprenol titers and consumption to levels observed in the starting strains. Collectively, this work demonstrated that an integrated strategy of laboratory evolution and rational engineering was effective to develop robust biofuel production hosts with minimized product toxicity.

The Australian government is investing $10.4 million in two initiatives to develop low carbon liquid fuels and biofuel production capabilities. These projects mark a significant step towards aviation industry decarbonization and achieving net zero targets. The studies will explore the feasibility of establishing a biorefinery facility using innovative biomass to biofuel technology and creating sustainable fuel infrastructure at a major airport. This investment aligns with Australia's commitment to developing domestic SAF production and supporting the transition to cleaner air travel. The projects will not only contribute to greenhouse gas reduction but also boost the country's renewable fuel alternatives sector.
