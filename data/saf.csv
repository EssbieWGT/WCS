A panel of top business aviation executives agreed that the industry’s current success and future growth will require visionaries who have an unwavering focus on the customer and appreciate the strength of professional peer networks.

That was the key message from NBAA’s Nov. 19 Thought Leadership webinar, “Pioneers of Progress — Lessons from Aviation’s Top Leaders, sponsored by NBAA Leadership Council Member, Mesinger Jet Sales.

“Success happens when you prioritize your customers,” said Michael Amalfitano, president and CEO of Embraer Executive Jets. “All of the businesses out there, you have to reflect on what you prioritize for your customer and provide a very clear vision of who you are.

“Your shareholders, your employees, need to be aligned with that culture, and if you stay true and authentic to that vision, customers will see that in your brand,” Amalfitano added.

That customer-centric approach is core to Duncan Aviation’s decades of success, noted company Chair Todd Duncan. “That’s how Duncan Aviation was founded. We built a culture and brand to deliver quality service to our customers, and that’s how we continue to thrive today.”

Tomorrow’s leaders can be inventive with how they approach this customer focus, said Avfuel President and CEO Craig Sincock, who over the past four decades has built a team of four people into a global company.

“In our early days, we figured out that we’re really not just in the fuel business, we were in the customer business,” he said. “We started looking at the things that surrounded fuel supply, like trucks, storage tanks, credit and credit card processing, insurance and we worked to surround the fuel transaction with a lot of other things that would help the customers in their business,

“That’s how we succeeded,” he added, noting, “if you’re always focusing on the customer, the business will follow.”

Emily Deaton, CEO of jetAVIA, echoed the importance of customer focus. “Leadership is about putting the customer at the center of everything you do and building up your team and committing to the brand,” she said.

But the panelists agreed that customer focus alone is not enough for future leaders to prosper. The strength of professional peer networks and industry associations is equally vital. Sincock noted that “to move ahead in this industry, you have to understand the industry, and that means learning from your peers,”

“You should also continually invest in yourself, go back to school, if needed, and remember that industry associations are a really powerful tool to connect with other industry leaders,” Duncan added.

Future leaders should also take time to consider the concept of leadership, the panelists agreed, with Amalfitano stressing that leadership “is not about one single moment; it’s about the choices you make.”

For Deaton, great leaders see their role holistically. “You have to understand what leadership isn’t,” she noted. “Sometimes, people have a misperception of leadership as just being in charge, or just building people up and celebrating them, and while those are important aspects, leadership is so much more,” she said.

Deaton added: “It’s about impact, intentional decision making, sacrifice, commitment to vision, putting the customer in the center of everything you do, building up your team and committing to the brand.”",https://nbaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MTA-Aviation-Hawker-Beechcraft-400XP-jet-rew-ramp.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 13:56:33.848609

Discomfort vs. conflict: They’re not the same Learning to tolerate discomfort doesn’t mean seeking out conflict; it means learning to manage it effectively.
Let me review my current workload and see how we can make this work.” You’re not creating conflict.
Breaking the imposter syndrome connection Here’s something crucial: when you’re constantly people-pleasing, you’re not showing up authentically.
Every time you choose discomfort over abandoning yourself, you’re building the muscle to show up as your authentic self.","If you’re a person with a chronic people-pleasing habit, you’ve probably heard all the standard advice: “Just be more assertive.” “Set better boundaries.” “Learn to say no.” And honestly? That advice has always felt incomplete to me and the thousands of clients I’ve helped over the last two decades.

Here’s what I’ve learned through my own journey and as a Master Certified Coach: you don’t need to become a jerk to stop people-pleasing at work. You just need to get better at tolerating the kind of discomfort that comes when you stop trying to manage everyone else’s emotions. Ooof….

Picture this: It’s Monday morning. You’re juggling three major projects when your colleague Sarah stops by. “Hey, I know you’re swamped, but could you help me with this presentation? You’re so good at this stuff.”

In that moment, your nervous system is scanning for threat: “What if Sarah thinks I’m not a team player? What if this affects my reputation? My raise?” Before you even process these thoughts consciously, you hear yourself saying, “Of course! I can squeeze it in tonight.”

Sound familiar?

What’s really happening when you people-please

Let’s be honest about what’s going on. Most people-pleasing at work isn’t about genuine generosity. It’s nervous system appeasement — habitual attempts to self-soothe by avoiding other people’s disappointment. This survival strategy once made sense, but now it’s exhausting you.

When you say yes to the fifth project outside your job description, when you smile through being interrupted, when you take the 7 a.m. call even though daycare doesn’t open until 7:15, it feels like you’re being collaborative. But what you’re really doing is outsourcing your self-worth to how others perceive you.

I used to be the queen of workplace people-pleasing. I’d stay late helping colleagues, take notes in every meeting even when it wasn’t my job and volunteer for committees nobody wanted. I told myself I was being helpful, building relationships. But the truth? I was terrified of being seen as difficult, excluded from the inner circle or being the one people complained about.

The psychological roots run deep. Many of us, especially women, were trained to equate being liked with being safe. “Be nice.” “Don’t rock the boat.” “Good girls don’t cause trouble.” These weren’t just social niceties – they were survival instructions. And they follow us into conference rooms and performance reviews.

The career cost of people-pleasing

Take my client Caroline, a marketing director who felt stuck despite being incredibly talented. She was constantly overwhelmed, working nights and weekends, but never getting recognition. Caroline had become the unofficial Office Mom — the one people came to for help, coverage, a sympathetic ear.

But here’s the problem: being indispensable in the wrong ways can make you invisible in the right ways. While Caroline managed everyone else’s workload and emotions, her strategic contributions got lost. She was so focused on being helpful that she wasn’t being strategic about her career.

Sometimes being too helpful signals that you’re support staff, not leadership material.

The real solution: Building discomfort tolerance

Here’s the shift I want you to make: instead of focusing on being less “nice,” focus on building your tolerance for the internal discomfort that comes when you’re not universally likable.

The reason you say yes when you want to say no isn’t because you’re too nice; it’s because you’re too polite. It’s because the discomfort of potentially disappointing someone feels unbearable. The thought of someone thinking you’re selfish triggers your nervous system’s alarm bells.

The work isn’t about becoming mean. It’s about learning to tolerate that discomfort without immediately moving to fix it.

Start here: One simple phrase

The next time someone asks you to take on something misaligned with your priorities, practice saying: “Let me think about that and get back to you.”

That’s it. You don’t need to explain why. Just buy yourself space and time.

Then breathe through the discomfort that bubbles up. Your nervous system will sound alarms, telling you you’re being rude. But that discomfort isn’t a sign you’ve done something wrong — it’s a sign you’re no longer abandoning yourself.

Build this tolerance by:

Starting small with low-stakes situations

Noticing physical sensations when the urge to people-please hits

Practicing self-compassion as you rewire decades-old patterns

Connecting with your “why” — what becomes possible when you stop managing everyone else’s emotions?

Discomfort vs. conflict: They’re not the same

Learning to tolerate discomfort doesn’t mean seeking out conflict; it means learning to manage it effectively. Conflict is external — a disagreement between people. Discomfort is internal — the feeling when you’re worried about others’ perceptions.

You can avoid unnecessary conflict while still tolerating the discomfort of not being universally liked. In fact, willingness to sit with discomfort often prevents conflict because you’re not building resentment from constantly sacrificing your needs.

When your boss asks you to take on another project but you’re at capacity, instead of immediately saying yes (and resenting it later), try: “I want to give this the attention it deserves. Let me review my current workload and see how we can make this work.”

You’re not creating conflict. You’re being professional about your capacity.

The transformation is real

I had another client, Jennifer, a project manager burning out from 60-hour weeks. She was terrified to say no, thinking it would damage her reputation. We worked on helping her tolerate the discomfort of not being the “yes” person.

Initially, she’d lie awake worrying about what people thought. But slowly, something shifted. When she said no to misaligned requests, she had more energy for projects that mattered. Her work quality improved. She contributed more strategically, rather than just agreeing with everything.

Her reputation actually improved. People saw her as more thoughtful and leadership-ready.

From compulsive to chosen

There’s a difference between helping because you genuinely want to contribute and helping because you’re afraid of what happens if you don’t. When you help from choice rather than compulsion, your contributions are more valuable.

Ask yourself:

Am I helping because I want to contribute, or because I’m afraid of not doing so?

Is this sustainable for me?

Am I helping from my strengths, or just doing whatever needs to be done?

Do I have boundaries around my helping?

Breaking the imposter syndrome connection

Here’s something crucial: when you’re constantly people-pleasing, you’re not showing up authentically. You’re showing up as the version you think others want to see. And when you’re not being authentic, it’s easy to feel like a fraud.

If you’re always saying yes when you want to say no, or always agreeing when you have different opinions, people never get to see who you really are. And if they don’t know the real you, how can you trust that they actually value you?

Breaking this cycle requires tolerating the discomfort of being seen as you really are, flaws and all. The people who matter will like the real you. The people who don’t weren’t really your people anyway.

Your discomfort isn’t a sign you’re doing something wrong. It’s a sign you’re growing, stepping outside your comfort zone, choosing courage over comfort.

What’s one small step you can take this week to practice tolerating discomfort instead of immediately people-pleasing? Start with low-stakes situations, but start somewhere.

Remember: you’re not responsible for managing other people’s emotions or making everyone comfortable. You’re only responsible for showing up authentically and treating people with respect.

Every time you choose discomfort over abandoning yourself, you’re building the muscle to show up as your authentic self. And that’s not just good for you — it’s good for everyone around you, because authenticity gives others permission to do the same.

You’re worthy of love and acceptance exactly as you are.

Sean Doyle, British Airways’ Chairman and CEO","We’re on a journey to a better BA and it’s something everyone here is committed to.

I can’t pretend that running an airline over the last few years has been without turbulence. We’ve had to dig deep to withstand the impact of the global pandemic which almost shut us down completely. Since then, our focus has been on rebuilding - putting in place solid foundations and embedding a mindset of continuous improvement. We’ve come a long way and we’ve achieved great results, but we know we have further to go.

For our teams, 2026 is about continuing to transform and innovate - unlocking the full benefits of the changes we’re making; taking everything we’ve built so far and raising the bar even higher. One of our mottos now is ‘Find it, Fix it’.

Our £7bn investment plan supports our ambition. We’ve already delivered more than 1,000 improvement projects, spanning every corner of the airline. From upgrading aircraft cabins and lounges to overhauling our operations and digital systems, the results are visible in how we’re delivering a better BA for everyone who flies with us, works with us and invests in us. The progress we’ve made means our business is now stronger, more resilient and better equipped to handle the challenges that come with running a global airline.

Transforming our operation

The foundations of a better BA enable us to be a resilient, punctual and safe operation - underpinned by high standards and technical reliability. Alongside the introduction of our Heathrow operating model, our £100m investment in technology has helped us make incredible progress in improving our on-time performance; something our customers fully deserve. The summer of 2025 was one of our most successful on record for punctuality. We’re all boosted by this achievement, and we’ll continue to build on this. We’re changing our operation for the better as we continue to modernise our systems with new technology, AI, machine learning and automation. We’ve updated and simplified a number of our most critical systems, making us more resilient and when unexpected issues occur, we recover much more quickly.

We’ve been laser-focused on improving the reliability of our aircraft to reduce delays and cancellations. The use of AI in our operation is helping deliver a significant improvement in our ability to recover from periods of weather and air traffic disruption. The technology has helped us deliver a 10% decrease in aircraft turnaround times and an estimated 10-15% reduction in cancellations on days where we have restrictions on the number of our aircraft that can take off and land at Heathrow.

We’re regularly welcoming new deliveries of modern, fuel-efficient planes into our fleet of 280+ aircraft. We’ve also grown our electric vehicle fleet as part of our airport operations and made one of the largest investments into ground service equipment in the UK to enhance the customer journey and support our sustainability goals. We’ve introduced 15 hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) powered buses, offering improved comfort and reduced emissions and supporting our BA Better World initiatives. We continue to invest in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)* and we recently celebrated four years of our BA Better World programme, with our colleagues driving the change we need to see. Thanks to the generosity of our people and customers, the BA Better World Community Fund has raised more than £8 million, supporting more than 200 UK-based charities and social enterprises - a truly remarkable achievement.

Transforming our customer experience

We’re focused on elevating the customer experience both on the ground and in the air to meet customers’ expectations, offering greater choice and competitive value. This includes our plans to introduce free, lightning-fast Starlink Wi-Fi on our aircraft from 2026 onwards. In the digital space, we’re launching a new ba.com and app to offer our customers a seamless and reliable user experience that makes travel simpler and more enjoyable.

We’re investing in our lounges and recently unveiled our bold new design concept with brand new openings in Miami and Dubai. We also completed lounge refreshes in London Gatwick, Lagos, Singapore, Seattle, and Washington Dulles.

We’re also introducing our new First seat as part of our A380 retrofit programme next year, continuing the rollout of our Club Suite (business class) and new short-haul cabins. We’re equipping our Customer Care team with new technology and connectivity to deliver a premium experience at 35,000ft, offering support for when things don’t go to plan. We’re in touch with our customers now more than ever before and have been improving our communications to offer a more seamless experience. Our Customer Relations team is rolling out WhatsApp messaging to a wider customer base following successful trials, and we’re increasing our live chat functionality to offer quicker in-the-moment solutions. Plus, we’re now offering digital vouchers at Heathrow during periods of disruption to allow customers to book hotels and buy food and drinks with greater ease.

Transforming our business

Our purpose remains to connect Britain with the world and the world with Britain, and we’ll continue to grow our network and ensure we’re competitive, while focusing on doing this sustainably. In 2026 we’re adding a further direct route between London and North America - taking the number of destinations we fly to directly in the US to 27, as we add St. Louis to our roster. In the competitive short-haul market we’ll focus on making sure we’re efficient and our costs are sustainable.

It’s important that BA is an organisation that our people are proud to work for, and I want to pay tribute to their hard work and dedication, which I see day in, day out when I’m out and about.

Our people are our biggest asset and are at the heart of our transformation. They’re crucial to our success as an organisation, and we’ll continue to enhance their experience, while embedding a change mindset and delivering a high-performance culture. This will be underpinned by strong leadership, collaboration, modern workspaces and tools. In everything we all do, every single one of us are guided by our corporate values:

Excellence – striving for world-class standards in everything we do

Caring – showing warmth, respect and genuine pride in representing BA

Open-Minded – being curious, bold and ready to embrace new ideas.

Change takes time, but I’m encouraged by the results we’re seeing and our efforts to step up the execution of all our transformation projects.

I’m grateful for your support as we continue on our journey to a better BA, and on behalf of the entire team, we’re looking forward to seeing you on board soon.

From Issue 6, 2025 of Breakbulk Magazine

(2-minute read)

Luke Mace, senior vice president, freight forwarding / project logistics, GEODIS

One of the main challenges lies in finding a balance between growth ambitions and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. There is a clear imbalance between transit times and cost efficiency versus customer expectations.

If we look at short-term and impactful actions, it’s about using the most efficient solutions available today, such as prioritizing sea or rail transport over air whenever possible, selecting the most energy-efficient aircraft or vessels (for example through GEODIS AirSmart), increasing the use of available low-carbon fuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), sustainable marine fuel (SMF) or hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), which can reduce GHG emissions by up to 80%, and ensuring space utilization so we don’t ship empty space.

GEODIS AirSmart is a great illustration. The company has recently launched this new low-carbon airfreight solution, designed to significantly reduce GHG emissions by optimizing aircraft performance and routing. By selecting the most energy-efficient aircraft and leveraging external flight data and advanced analytics, GEODIS AirSmart enables smarter routing decisions and enhances performance.

This innovation represents a major step forward in GEODIS’s journey toward decarbonization and supports customers in achieving their climate goals. With GEODIS AirSmart we can achieve up to 40% reduction in GHG emission per shipment.

Roger Strevens, director, low carbon regulation and advocacy, Methanex

In mid-October, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) held a meeting to consider the adoption of the Net Zero Framework (NZF), the regulatory package that is intended to deliver on the goals of its 2023 GHG strategy, which was unanimously supported by member states. The NZF had been approved, the first step in the regulatory process, by a large majority back in April at Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) 83.

However, due to widely reported pressure from the U.S., many member states changed their positions. The outcome was that a vote was called to adjourn the adoption meeting by a year, and it was carried 57-49.

While adjournment of the adoption meeting was disappointing to many, it is important to note the NZF has not been rejected, rather member states are not in a position to adopt it yet. Critically, there is now time to develop the NZF to a point where there is consensus for adoption.

It is important for the IMO not to lose momentum. Work continues on the supporting guidelines, and the IMO Secretariat will consult closely with member states to determine the best path forward. The consistent support from global shipping organizations highlights the industry’s readiness to advance sustainability and clean fuels. A unified global approach for a global industry is economically and environmentally preferable to fragmented regulations that are separated by national and regional borders.

For breakbulk shipping companies, the NZF deferral may temporarily pause decisions around retrofitting or ordering vessels for alternative fuels, but it also offers a window to monitor developments like the upcoming review of FuelEU Maritime. Given the long-term nature of fleet investments, it remains prudent to anticipate the growing prominence of decarbonization regulations.

In this context, methanol stands out as a compelling option for breakbulk vessels due to its favorable overall cost, lower complexity and minimal impact on cargo space. It is compatible with tramp operations due to the relatively low cost of port infrastructure needed, making it an attractive choice. Methanex is committed to supporting shipping companies as they navigate these decisions.

In summary, given that the shipping industry wants to progress and leading clean fuel producers are poised to deliver, the pace of political alignment will be crucial for future progress.

The U.S. SAF market is expected to grow more than seven-fold - from approximately $860 million in 2024 to nearly $7 billion by 2030 - representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~47%. Globally, the SAF market is projected to exceed $25 billion, with worldwide demand surpassing 5.5 billion gallons over the same period.

At the state level, momentum is accelerating in parallel. California, Oregon, Washington, and New Mexico have adopted low-carbon fuel standards that include SAF, and five additional states are advancing similar frameworks. Collectively, these states represent nearly 40% of total U.S. jet fuel consumption, creating a rapidly expanding incentive landscape for SAF deployment.

""Policy momentum is transforming aspiration into execution,"" said Chris Cooper, CEO of XCF Global. ""The U.S. is making it clear that sustainable aviation fuel is essential to the future of aviation. With supportive federal and state frameworks, airlines and energy companies can move beyond pilot programs and commit to long-term, scalable decarbonization strategies. At XCF, we're building one of America's leading SAF platforms - designed to scale production, strengthen domestic supply chains, and meet the growing demand for home-grown, low-carbon fuels.""

From inception, approximately $350 million has been invested in XCF's flagship New Rise Reno facility. The company is advancing a project pipeline of three additional sites. The second facility, New Rise Reno 2, located adjacent to the existing site, will share utilities and logistics infrastructure to maximize efficiencies. XCF expects construction to begin in 2026 and operations from 2028, following an additional $300 million investment that is expected to double production capacity to ~80 million gallons per year.

As global demand accelerates, the U.S. has an opportunity to not only meet its own decarbonization goals but also to become a leading exporter of low-carbon fuels. Expanding domestic SAF production supports the Make More in America Initiative, creates high-tech, clean-energy jobs, and strengthens the nation's competitiveness in the global energy transition.

""America's aviation industry has always thrived on innovation,"" Cooper continued. ""With clear policy alignment and accelerating demand, the U.S. has a generational opportunity to lead the world in sustainable aviation. XCF is committed to turning that opportunity into action - transforming today's policy commitments into tomorrow's progress.""

Argus, an energy and commodity market intelligence firm, has launched the aviation industry’s first calculated price indexes for electrolytic sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF). It shows the current cost of eSAF is thirteen times that of fossil-based jet fuel.

The firm aims to address the urgent need of aviation fuel suppliers, airlines, and policymakers for clear pricing as they work toward meeting industry mandates.

In a brief on the new price index, Argus notes that while Europe and the UK are advancing toward more stringent SAF requirements, there is a widening disconnect between policy ambition, cost realities and investment delays.

Argus eSAF indexes show the scale of the challenge

Argus’ newly launched weekly indexes calculate the production cost of eSAF in the Amsterdam–Rotterdam–Antwerp (ARA) region, in both €/t and $/t, and are published both including and excluding capital expenditure.

The November 2025 cost assessment shows eSAF is currently:

13× the cost of fossil jet fuel

3.5× the cost of HEFA-SPK bio-SAF

This structural price gap will persist, Argus argues, as long as hydrocarbon jet fuel prices fail to reflect their environmental cost. Governments will need to provide long-term policy support to bridge it.

SAF is the only near-term path to reducing aviation emissions

Since electric propulsion or hydrogen aircraft will require a decade or more of engine redesign and infrastructure overhaul, SAF remains the only saleable option today capable of reducing aviation emissions without modifying existing aircraft or airport systems.

Europe and the UK began their SAF mandates this year with an initial 2% requirement, ramping sharply through 2035 as part of their net-zero roadmap.

European Union – ReFuelEU Aviation

Starting at 2% SAF of the total jet-fuel supply in 2025.

Rising to 6% by 2030.

Then to 20% by 2035.

Long-term target: 70% by 2050.

There is also a sub-mandate for synthetic (PtL/eSAF) fuels: starting at 0.7% in 2030 and increasing to 35% by 2050.

United Kingdom – SAF Mandate

Mandatory SAF share begins in 2025 at 2% of total UK jet-fuel demand.

Increases to 10% by 2030.

Reaches 22% by 2040.

Additional UK sub-target for PtL SAF starting at 0.2% by 2028 and reaching up to 3.5% by 2040.

Read more: Which European airlines use the most SAF?

Airlines are not optimistic about finding an adequate, affordable SAF supply

Under pressure, the airline industry is questioning the viability of SAF mandates.

Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary has been openly sceptical. As reported by the BBC this August, he said there is “not a hope in hell” of the UK’s 10% SAF mandate being met by 2030. O’Leary also said that Ryanair would not increase its SAF use because supply “is not there,” and described SAF as “nonsense.”

IATA argues that governments must support the development of technology that would stabilise SAF supply and make it more affordable. Ahead of this year’s ICAO Assembly, IATA Director General Willie Walsh said SAF was “absolutely critical” for airlines to meet their net zero targets by 2050.

“We’re disappointed at the progress made in relation to production. It’s not where we need it to be,” he said. “The problem, as we see it, is one of supply and not one of demand.”

Policymakers, however, are holding to their targets, requiring aviation to decarbonise alongside other transport modes, while failing to address the production gap.

Argus sees SAF oversupply today, and a crisis by 2030

Argus forecasts a global oversupply of SAF until around 2030, when EU mandates become far more stringent and penalties begin to bite.

Conventional jet fuel suppliers face billions of dollars in potential fines if they fail to meet SAF quotas. At the same time, airlines must refuel with SAF-blended jet fuel at major EU airports or absorb penalties for tankering fuel from elsewhere.

Current SAF pricing discourages greater adoption. In northwest Europe, SAF prices recently surged to a two-year high—nearly $3,000 per tonne, more than 3.5 times the cost of conventional jet fuel—despite the overall oversupply.

Argus attributes this temporary tightening to factors such as plant maintenance and weak imports. Yet even as prices rise, major producers, including BP and Shell, have delayed or cancelled SAF projects, citing economic and policy uncertainty.

Argus says there is growing awareness that bio-SAF alone cannot decarbonise aviation. Feedstocks such as used cooking oil—on which HEFA production depends—are finite and structurally insufficient for the scale of demand.

eSAF mandates loom, but industry is unprepared

Hydrogen-derived eSAF will become mandatory in the EU from 2030, but Argus believes the supply chain is nowhere near ready to deliver.

To meet quotas, the region will require roughly 600,000 tonnes of eSAF annually, equivalent to about 12 commercial-scale plants. Yet of the 70 proposed UK and EU eSAF projects tracked by Argus, not a single one has reached a final investment decision (FID).

Plant construction takes three to four years, meaning FIDs must be taken within the next year for Europe to have any chance of meeting 2030 obligations. The risk of non-compliance will have serious financial consequences.

If no eSAF is available in 2030, penalties for EU fuel suppliers could total $5–10 billion, and obligations roll forward annually. According to Argus, the ongoing debate over whether the EU would enforce such penalties has further dampened investor confidence.

A SAF Catch-22 is blocking investment

Argus believes a fundamental misalignment between supply and demand hampers the financing of eSAF projects. Long-term offtake agreements are necessary to secure funding for these projects.

However, airlines, which typically operate with tight margins and favour short-term fuel contracts, are hesitant to commit tens of millions of dollars upfront for a fuel whose price might decrease as the technology evolves. This conflict is the primary factor stalling investment across the e-SAF sector.

“Long-term eSAF offtake agreements are essential to the financing of production facilities,” said Argus Media chairman and chief executive Adrian Binks. “But buyers are wary of committing tens of millions of dollars to such agreements, creating a disconnect between supply obligations and demand that has stalled investment.

“Our new modelled costs will provide important independent transparency upon which participants across the e-SAF value chain can rely to inform their long-term decision making.”

The new eSAF indexes add to Argus’ established SAF benchmarks in Northwest Europe, Asia-Pacific and the US, leveraging the organisation’s pricing and consultancy depth across biofuels, natural gas and hydrogen.

With mandates accelerating, penalties looming and investment lagging, the industry faces a narrowing window to align supply capacity with regulatory expectations. Argus expects its data will give airlines, refiners, and policymakers a clearer view of the fundamental economics of eSAF—precisely when informed decision-making is most urgent.

The agreement, signed during the Dubai Airshow, brings together the UAE’s largest airline and its main fuel supplier at a time when global aviation is under pressure to cut emissions and secure long-term access to cleaner fuels, reports Gulf News.

Under the MoU, both sides will conduct feasibility studies to determine what is required to build a dependable SAF supply chain in Dubai. The studies will look at supply infrastructure, the possibility of local production, blending needs, and the commercial factors necessary to ensure long-term sustainability. A joint steering committee will oversee the process, reflecting a coordinated effort between two major players in the UAE aviation sector.

SAF is a certified drop-in fuel that works with existing aircraft and current airport systems. It can be blended with regular jet fuel by up to 50 percent, and in its unblended form, it can reduce lifecycle emissions by as much as 80 percent. This makes it one of the most practical short-term tools available to aviation as broader decarbonisation technologies continue to evolve.

Emirates has already been involved in SAF-related work in the UAE, contributing to the General Policy for Sustainable Aviation Fuel and taking part in committees examining biofuels, hydrogen, and future aviation fuels. The policy aims to make the UAE a regional hub for cleaner fuels, with a target of producing 700 million litres of SAF annually by 2030.

The airline has carried out several SAF demonstration flights to test operational readiness. In January 2023, it operated a Boeing 777 flight using 100 percent SAF in one engine. In November 2023, it followed this with the first A380 demonstration flight using 100 percent SAF in one engine. That same month, Emirates also operated flights from Dubai International Airport using more than 315,000 gallons of blended SAF that was supplied directly through the airport’s fuel network.

During its 2024–25 financial year, Emirates obtained 7,519 tonnes of SAF at several international airports, including Amsterdam, London Heathrow, Oslo, Singapore, Paris, Lyon, and Nice.

The goal is to streamline processes across the industry to make CO2 emissions data visible and consistent for passengers at the time of booking their flights. The Flight Emissions Label stems from a regulation launched by the European Union in 2024, under the responsibility of EASA. This provides a trustworthy framework for airlines to share flight emissions data with passengers transparently. The EcoHub by IATA is a comprehensive system for airline sustainability data management, reporting, and compliance. Alongside this, IATA CO2 Connect collects airline operational data and calculates the CO2 performance of the flights, similar to the data required for the issuance of the Flight Emissions Label.

With this Memorandum of Understanding, EASA and IATA aim to explore participation in the Flight Emissions Label by aligning processes for label issuance use cases for airlines in a cost-effective way.

Florian Guillermet, Executive Director of EASA, said: “This partnership with IATA, the world’s largest airlines’ association, will make it easier for airlines to join the Flight Emissions Label. The more airlines we have on board, the better the overall information for air passengers, allowing them to make informed choices when they book their flights.”

Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA, said: “Regulatory compliance and customer demands for transparent emissions information must be met with the highest standards. Providing accurate emissions data is crucial for informed decision-making and for maintaining confidence in the sustainability of air transport. IATA’s EcoHub and our access to extensive sustainability data will give airlines an easier way to be part of the Flight Emissions Label, and confidence that the very best data will be utilized. Our collaboration with EASA will focus on enabling an efficient and harmonized exchange of data, reducing administrative burdens, and achieving long-term cost savings for all stakeholders.”

The signing took place at IATA’s Wings of Change Europe, on 18-19 November 2025, in Brussels.

Background Information

The Regulation that put the Flight Emissions Label (FEL) in place was adopted in December 2024 by the European Commission and aims to empower passengers with information on flight-related emissions, allowing them to make informed decisions when booking and comparing flights. The label will also increase accountability within the aviation sector by establishing a harmonized emissions calculation methodology, data reporting, and emissions display for all airlines in the European Union. Building on a fully digitalized process, FEL will also reduce the administrative burden for the sector.

The FEL provides a trustworthy framework for airlines to share flight emissions data with passengers. Airlines from both EU and non-EU countries, covered under the scope of Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 “ReFuelEU Aviation”, can voluntarily join the FEL. Only those airlines that have joined are allowed to display emissions to their passengers in the European Union, in accordance with Article 6(5) of the Regulation. The European Commission and EASA encourage airlines to join the FEL if they want to display flight emissions and use these estimates when, for example, offering sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) or other emissions offsets to passengers.

IATA EcoHub and CO2 Connect

IATA manages the EcoHub and IATA CO2 Connect, a carbon emissions calculator for both passenger and air cargo based on primary airline data collected from more than 90 airlines. The collaboration with EASA will explore how leveraging these tools can create efficiencies for synergies with the EU Flight Emissions Label, ensuring consistency and transparency across the industry. Airlines are continuously joining CO2 Connect, increasing its effectiveness and the quality of its data, with Kenya Airways the latest to sign up.

Residual waste is no longer just ‘trash’ in the UK – it is a strategic climate resource. This new OIES study shows why policymakers and industry leaders need to rethink where it goes. The paper compares two competing pathways: using waste in Energy-from-Waste plants with carbon capture (WECCS), which can deliver durable, net-negative emissions by capturing and permanently storing biogenic CO₂; and converting waste into Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which helps decarbonize a hard-to-abate sector by displacing fossil jet fuel. Both routes offer climate value, but not equally, and not simultaneously.

WECCS consistently delivers the larger climate payoff because it permanently removes carbon from the atmosphere, while SAF offers important but more modest benefits through fossil-fuel substitution and material recovery. With finite waste available, the UK risks policy incoherence if separate incentives push waste in opposite directions. The study advocates for treating waste as a climate asset.

“Asia Pacific is growing at a very fast pace. (The region’s) governments are determined to support this growth, because aviation plays a big part in their economies, I think we'll get there,” Menon said.

“(They) are working … with their airlines, fuel suppliers, manufacturers and airports to achieve that target. Most of these governments have got their (sustainable) fuel suppliers on the ready.”

GOVERNMENTS STEP UP ON SUSTAINABILITY

Menon noted that an increasing number of governments in the region are introducing policies and regulations aimed at supporting the industry’s sustainability targets.

They include encouraging the adoption of cleaner jet fuels to promoting technological innovation and collaboration among sectors.

Singapore, for example, implemented an SAF levy last week. Airline passengers departing from Singapore will have to pay duties ranging from S$1 (US$0.77) to S$41.60 per ticket, depending on their travel destination and travel class.

Singapore also aims for SAF to account for 1 per cent of all jet fuel next year, rising to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.

Menon said there is a need for governments to enforce policies and regulations to accelerate SAF production and adoption because high costs, limited infrastructure and market uncertainty make it difficult for the private sector to scale up on its own.

“It’s very important for governments to be proactive. Most people would say yes … to addressing emissions, but what people say and what people do sometimes differ,” he said.

“Unless there is a trigger, a call to action, people don't really act. (Singapore’s SAF) levy is (that) call to action and gives people an opportunity to participate in the greening of the planet.”

Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s most populous country, is considering a regulation to require international flights from Jakarta and Bali use a 1 per cent SAF blend from next year, gradually increasing to 5 per cent by 2035.

Malaysia is targeting a 47 per cent SAF blending mandate by 2050, and is looking to build domestic production, blending and supply of the fuel.

Japan has mandated that its refiners must supply SAF equivalent to 10 per cent of their aviation fuel sales by 2030.

EXTERNAL HEADWINDS & RESILIENT DEMAND

Most aviation experts agree that sustainable jet fuel is currently the most feasible path to greener skies as it can be used with existing aircraft and airport infrastructure.

Such fuel is made from renewable or waste-based materials instead of petroleum. It can come from biofuels derived from crops, waste-based sources like used cooking oil, or synthetic e-fuels made by combining captured carbon with hydrogen.

However, its availability remains severely limited – the commodity accounted for just 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production in 2024.

As such, Menon said advancing technology to enhance efficiency is also a crucial part of the industry’s roadmap towards net-zero emissions.

But while there have been significant gains in emissions reductions through technology, supply chain issues – including bottlenecks in aircraft, engine and component production and delivery – have slowed progress, he said.

Furthermore, tariffs – particularly those from United States President Donald Trump – are expected to spur inflation and undermine supply chain recovery, he added

Industry groups representing global aerospace companies have already warned that such duties could jeopardise air safety or trigger other unintended consequences.

“Chief among … troubling developments in the external environment … are tariffs, (which) can do a lot of damage. In spite of that, we expect that (air travel) demand will continue to grow,” Menon said.

What was once described as “revenge travel” – a buzzword coined in 2021 to capture the surge in pent-up demand for vacations after pandemic lockdowns – has now evolved into “resilient travel”, he said.

Each year since the pandemic has seen a steady rise in tourism numbers, reflecting the world’s enduring appetite for travel.

In 2024, there were 1.5 billion international arrivals globally, a 12 per cent increase from the previous year, according to the United Nations.

“Demand for air travel, both cargo and passenger, is very strong. Everybody wants to travel, whether it is for business or leisure,” Menon said.

“So, that is why you see Asia Pacific governments doing their best to support the industry's growth, even while trying to help them address the problems of sustainability.”","https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--IJ0szXXq--/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/one-cms/core/2025-06-30t133925z_1_lynxmpel5t0nn_rtroptp_3_emirates-aviation.jpg?itok=ie7M5mPe",N,,2025-11-20 05:56:30.239201

PA Consulting’s new report explores the barriers to scaling Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and how airports can lead the charge to decarbonise aviation.

Airports’ critical role in scaling SAF solutions

As aviation faces the challenge to decarbonise flight, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has emerged as the most immediate and scalable solution.

Yet despite SAF’s promise – cutting lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 70 percent compared to fossil-based jet fuel – progress remains patchy. Our research report, Cacophony to symphony: successfully scaling sustainable aviation fuel, identifies cost, misalignment, and fragmented action as the primary barriers to widespread adoption.

The research gathered views on SAF from close to 600 leaders globally across the SAF value chain, including 125 airport representatives. Across all respondents, the survey reveals strong belief in SAF’s potential:

92 percent of respondents say SAF is crucial to decarbonisation

78 percent believe it holds promise for job creation

Yet only 40 percent are optimistic about widespread SAF adoption by 2030.

Specifically, leaders from airports project SAF to rise from three percent of total aviation fuel today to seven percent by 2030 – this would be consistent with the level of the EU mandates but fall short of the UK’s 10 percent target. Even more discouragingly, two-thirds of the airports we surveyed lack a SAF strategy, and half have no net zero roadmap.

The more encouraging finding is that airports, as physical hubs and conveners of the aviation ecosystem, have a unique opportunity to lead the charge and orchestrate a whole-system response to scale SAF. So, how can airports reframe their role to help orchestrate SAF success?

Lay the foundations for policy success

To scale SAF, our research finds it’s vital that government policy actively encourages investment in, and creates confidence around, the SAF market – because a significant market shift requires market stimulation. Yet it’s also clear that key players can’t wait for government to act. Airport leaders can start driving progress in response to known conditions, and in parallel with ongoing policy developments.

In the face of wider federal uncertainty in the US, for instance, airports should be focusing on local action – partnering with state- and regional-level leaders to co-fund SAF infrastructure or offer tax incentives. These efforts lead by example and also create proof points that can shape higher-level policy. With the likes of San Francisco International Airport (SFO), we’re already seeing bold, state-based action shape the future of SAF in the US. Working with a coalition of 150 airlines, fuel providers, and other organisations, SFO successfully lobbied the California Air Resources Board to expand the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) to offer the opt-in inclusion of SAF. As a result, the LCFS offers a ~$1.25 per US gallon incentive for SAF over conventional fuel, levelling the playing field and making California ‘the world’s most competitive market for SAF’.

Beyond that, airports can start engaging with, and supporting as appropriate, national SAF policies such as the UK’s proposed revenue certainty mechanism. And by investing in SAF-compatible infrastructure, co-developing supply networks, and partnering across the value chain. Examples include Heathrow’s SAF incentive scheme and the Minnesota SAF Hub.

Act as the convenor for the SAF cost reduction mission

Our research found that cost is the single biggest barrier to SAF scale-up. SAF is projected to cost 115 percent more than conventional jet fuel by 2030.

Airports can help rebalance risk and reward by facilitating buyer coalitions, aggregating demand, and enabling longer, bankable offtake agreements. According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), 175 airports globally already offer or have offered , and this number is expected to grow as supply becomes a competitive differentiator.

Innovative procurement models – such as Book & Claim and Scope 3 attribute sales – allow airports, airlines, corporations, and others to support SAF production without physical delivery. Projects such as British Airways’ long-term contracts with Project Speedbird demonstrate how early adoption can yield cost advantages and market leadership.

Airports can act as conveners – bringing together airlines, fuel suppliers, corporates, and passengers. The aforementioned Minnesota SAF Hub, which supplies SAF to Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport, demonstrates the power of regional collaboration. Backed by Delta Air Lines, Bank of America, and the State of Minnesota, the hub aims to produce up to one billion US gallons of SAF annually, integrating feedstocks, refining, and pipeline delivery.

Future-proof with flexibility

With two-thirds of airport respondents to our survey saying they do not have a SAF strategy, and half with no net zero roadmap, inertia risks undermining public trust and investor confidence. Out of everyone in the SAF ecosystem, airports are closest to their communities and often bear the brunt of environmental scrutiny. As our report notes, “If airports aren’t seen to act, the court of public and government opinion may turn against them.”

With 75 percent of global travellers expressing a desire to travel more and 44 percent willing to pay more for SAF-powered flights, the pressure is mounting. Airports must demonstrate they are part of a regenerative future – not just by complying with mandates, but by leading the transition.

We’re seeing positive examples. The CEO of Massport, the operator of Boston Logan Airport (BOS), has set out a far-reaching plan to develop a New England SAF Hub. Yet more airports need to shift from hesitation to action. SAF-readiness assessments can identify low-cost infrastructure upgrades, depending on each airport’s unique attributes. These assessments also consider whether current models require open access legislation. At airports such as Hong Kong International Airport (HKG), any qualified supplier can supply jet aviation fuel. Airlines are free to choose their suppliers and into-plane agents based on price and service, and may also act as their own supplier.

Along the way, transparency is key. Airports should track and publish SAF uptake data to build transparency and investor confidence, linking to platforms like the IATA SAF Registry or national fuel tracking systems. These metrics and key indicators should align with global norms, such as those used by ICAO, with the option to use public-facing dashboards or open data portals for wider stakeholders to access and validate the data, as appropriate.

And as the SAF market evolves, flexibility will be key. Producers like Firefly Green Fuels and LanzaJet are developing modular facilities and diversified feedstock strategies to adapt to market forces. Airports must similarly remain agile – ready to pivot as technologies, policies, and consumer expectations shift.

Airports as proactive leaders

Almost two decades on from the first commercial SAF flight, our research is clear: no one player can scale SAF alone. We need collaboration, not fragmentation.

While our report delves into the required actions for all players across the SAF ecosystem, it’s clear that airports have a distinct and central role to play. They are uniquely positioned to convene all parts of the aviation ecosystem, together with the fuel suppliers and government actors necessary, to orchestrate the symphony of SAF scale-up.

The plant will convert about 500,000 tonnes of waste into SAF annually, using a hybrid production technique that combines renewable energy-powered electrolysis to produce green hydrogen and waste gasification, state news agency Wam reported on Thursday.

Once operational, the project is expected to serve several markets, positioning Abu Dhabi as a regional centre for SAF, it said.

The plant is expected to boost the UAE’s role in sustainable aviation, a sector deemed critical to economic development and driving the nation's decarbonisation goals, said Mohamed Al Ramahi, chief executive of Masdar.

“Masdar is committed to accelerating the global energy transformation through partnerships and delivering innovative solutions that meet customer needs,” he said.

Global airlines consider sustainable jet fuel as key to their goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Despite high demand, supply is small while the costs are high, resulting in slow progress.

SAF is typically derived from animal fats, used cooking oil and other feedstocks. It can also be produced synthetically through a process that captures carbon directly from the air.

The greener fuel – which reduces carbon dioxide emissions by up to 80 per cent – could contribute nearly 65 per cent of the reduction in emissions needed by aviation to reach net zero by 2050, according to the International Air Transport Association.

The new SAF development is also key to help decarbonise the UAE's aviation sector.

“This agreement marks a pivotal step … to unlock waste as a valuable resource with the potential to be converted to key energy resources,” said Ali Al Dhaheri, managing director and chief executive of Tadweer Group.

It is the new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) levy, and it applies to both passengers and cargo. For some flyers, this means an extra dollar. For others, it means forty. For an industry built on razor-thin margins and a nation with no domestic aviation market, the question is simple: can Singapore stay competitive while being greener?

In this week’s TransportBT, a podcast of BT Correspondents, host Derryn Wong sits down with Terence Fan from Singapore Management University to unpack whether this new levy is smart climate policy, a necessary evil, or an own goal waiting to happen.

Why listen

What SAF actually is: Cooking oil, waste products and a lot of complicated chemistry. Fan breaks down why this fuel is the aviation sector’s only realistic near-term climate solution.

Will flying get pricier: A dollar here and forty dollars there may not sound like much, but airlines with shaky finances are already sweating.

Cargo counts too: The levy hits freight, although at a level that most forwarders will barely notice. Still, the psychology of cost matters in a tight logistics market.

Singapore’s big strategic gamble: Changi stays competitive by being efficient and transparent. Will a government-set fixed price envelope for SAF keep airlines loyal, or tempt them to route through cheaper hubs?

From Europe’s evolving rules to Singapore’s own SAF ecosystem, this episode maps out what the levy really means for travellers, businesses and the aviation industry holding the republic’s economic lifeline aloft.

Singapore’s green fuel levy isn’t just another surcharge, it’s a bold statement to the world of aviation: that it's serious about playing a pivotal, pioneering role in sustainable air travel.","We all know that flying isn’t great for the planet. But what to do about it? There‘s always opting for overland travel, but not every traveller has time on their side. Short of setting annual limits for frequent flyers, adding an extra tax for air passengers is one way to help bolster decarbonisation efforts – and one Asian country is doing just that.

Starting October 2026 and applying to all tickets purchased after April 1, passengers departing from Singapore will face a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) levy, the first of its kind in the world, as part of an ambitious goal to decarbonise the sky. Don't think of it as a tax. Think of it as a eco-friendly, forward-thinking step to help air travel become more sustainable across the world.

So, what is this tax for?

According to the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), the levy is based on the volume of SAF needed to meet its one percent target for 2026, as well as SAF's projected price premium. While SAF is significantly more sustainable than conventional jet fuel (SAF is made from recycled oils and agricultural residue), it is also significantly more expensive to produce.

How much will travellers have to pay?

Thankfully, the new charges won't break the average traveller's bank. Short routes will only charge S$1 (£0.58), while passengers on long-haul economy flights will be charged S$10.40 (£6.08). Even the highest rate, S$41.60 (£24.33) for first-class or business flights, is still significantly cheaper than paying for an extra check-in bag.

The levy will apply to all tickets or services sold from April 1, 2026, including cargo shipments and business flights, for journeys taking off from October 1 onwards. This might feel like a small price to pay, but it’s part of a much bigger picture, so our planet doesn't pay the price later.

To keep payment fair, SAF charges will vary based on the distance travelled by air passengers and the cabin of travel chosen for each flight. The levy will also be categorised in four geographical bands. Group one consists of Southeast Asia. Group two includes Northeast and South Asia, Australia and Papua New Guinea. Group three consists of Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Pacific Islands and New Zealand, and group four is the Americas.

Are there any exceptions?

Not everyone flying will pick up the green tab. The levy only applies to passengers departing from Singapore to a different destination. Transit travellers passing through Changi (or Seletar) are exempt – the tax is only applied to flights originating from Singapore. Training flights, humanitarian missions and specific chartered services will also avoid the fee. The levy is also only implemented on your very next destination. For example, if you were flying to the States with a connecting flight in Hong Kong, you'd only be charged for the flight to Hong Kong.

Singapore’s green fuel levy isn’t just another surcharge, it’s a bold statement to the world of aviation: that it's serious about playing a pivotal, pioneering role in sustainable air travel. But will other destinations follow suit, or will Singapore remain ahead head of the game?

The agreement, announced at the Dubai Airshow, aims to explore the production and supply of alternative aviation fuel, commonly known as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), at Dubai’s global aviation hub. This move is not just a leap for the airline but also a powerful push for the future of aviation in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), positioning the country as a leader in sustainable aviation practices.

A Step Toward Sustainable Aviation

In an era where climate change and sustainability are top priorities worldwide, the aviation industry is under pressure to reduce its carbon footprint. Emirates’ partnership with ENOC Group is a key milestone in addressing this challenge. The agreement will focus on the local production of SAF, a fuel made from renewable resources that can drastically reduce aviation’s environmental impact.

The two companies plan to assess the supply chain, production capabilities, and commercial feasibility of SAF in Dubai. ENOC, the state-owned oil and gas company, will look into how it can contribute to the local production of this alternative fuel, helping to create a more sustainable aviation ecosystem.

The UAE government has set ambitious targets for the aviation sector, aiming for 1% of the fuel used by national airlines to come from sustainable sources by 2031. With this new deal, Emirates is playing a crucial role in helping the UAE achieve its sustainability goals.

Understanding Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Sustainable aviation fuel is a game-changer in the aviation industry. Unlike traditional jet fuel made from fossil fuels, SAF is derived from renewable sources such as plant oils, waste materials, and even carbon captured from the atmosphere. SAF reduces carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, making it an essential part of efforts to decarbonise aviation.

The development of SAF is vital for the long-term future of aviation. While aircraft manufacturers and airlines are working to build more fuel-efficient planes, the most immediate way to reduce the industry’s carbon footprint is by switching to SAF.

Emirates CEO: A Vision for the Future

Adel Al Redha, the CEO and Deputy President of Emirates, emphasised that establishing a reliable SAF supply in Dubai is a top priority for the airline. According to him, the collaboration with ENOC will help Emirates assess the most practical and effective ways to integrate SAF into its operations.

Al Redha acknowledged that there are significant challenges ahead, especially regarding supply constraints and infrastructure requirements. However, he believes that partnerships like the one with ENOC are essential in overcoming these challenges. These collaborations will pave the way for broader SAF accessibility in Dubai and, eventually, across Emirates’ extensive global network.

Strategic Importance for the UAE

This partnership is part of Emirates’ larger strategy to support the UAE’s vision of becoming a regional hub for sustainable aviation fuels. The UAE government has been proactive in advancing the country’s alternative aviation fuel ecosystem. Emirates is not just a key player in this process; it is actively involved in shaping policies and initiatives that will benefit the aviation industry as a whole.

Emirates is a member of several important committees, including the Aviation Fuels Executive Committee, convened by Dubai’s Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, and the Dubai Biofuels, Hydrogen and Sustainable Aviation Fuel Committee. These bodies are working together to create a sustainable future for aviation in the UAE.

UAE’s General Policy for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The UAE is committed to becoming a leader in sustainable aviation fuel production. The country has set ambitious goals to transform its aviation sector and has targeted 700 million litres of SAF production by 2030. This policy aims to help the UAE reduce its carbon emissions, promote green energy solutions, and establish itself as a key player in the global aviation fuel market.

Emirates, as one of the UAE’s most prominent airlines, is fully supporting this vision. The airline’s active participation in developing the General Policy for Sustainable Aviation Fuel reflects its dedication to creating a more sustainable future for aviation.

Emirates’ Global Commitment to SAF

While the new partnership with ENOC focuses on the local production of SAF, Emirates has already been procuring alternative aviation fuels from various locations across its global network. In its 2024-2025 financial year, Emirates purchased 7,519 tonnes of SAF at airports in cities like Amsterdam, London Heathrow, Oslo, Singapore, Paris, Lyon, and Nice.

This proactive approach to using SAF is part of Emirates’ broader commitment to sustainability and reducing its carbon footprint. The airline has long been a leader in sustainable aviation, and its efforts are contributing to the global push for greener air travel.

A Greener Future for Aviation

The collaboration between Emirates and ENOC is a clear sign that the future of aviation is heading towards sustainability. The development of SAF production in Dubai is just one step in a much larger movement to reduce the aviation industry’s environmental impact.

However, as Adel Al Redha pointed out, there is still much work to be done. Establishing reliable and scalable SAF production requires significant investment in infrastructure, supply chains, and research. Nevertheless, with partnerships like the one between Emirates and ENOC, the aviation industry is moving closer to achieving its sustainability goals.

The Broader Implications for the Global Aviation Industry

The UAE is positioning itself as a leader in sustainable aviation, and the Emirates-ENOC partnership is just the beginning. The success of this initiative could have far-reaching effects on the global aviation industry, encouraging other countries and airlines to follow suit in their efforts to reduce emissions and develop alternative fuel sources.

As the demand for sustainable aviation fuel grows, more partnerships between airlines, fuel providers, and governments will be crucial in meeting this demand. The global aviation industry must work together to create a future where air travel is not only efficient but also sustainable.

Emirates and Air Canada: Expanding Horizons

In addition to its commitment to SAF, Emirates has recently extended its codeshare agreement with Air Canada, which will create new gateways in Canada. This agreement, which was first established in 2022, will now run until 2032, further strengthening the ties between the two airlines.

The expanded codeshare network covers 56 routes connecting Dubai to 37 destinations in Canada and the US. This collaboration will allow passengers to enjoy seamless connections across North America and the Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.

A New Era for Sustainable Aviation in Dubai

The partnership between Emirates and ENOC is a significant milestone in the UAE’s journey towards a more sustainable aviation future. By working together to develop SAF production capabilities in Dubai, these two companies are setting the stage for a cleaner, greener aviation industry. The UAE’s ambition to become a regional hub for sustainable aviation fuels, supported by Emirates’ global commitment to SAF, marks a new era in aviation sustainability.

As the world grapples with climate change, the need for sustainable aviation practices has never been more urgent. Emirates’ proactive approach to SAF, combined with the UAE’s bold policy goals, signals that the future of aviation in Dubai and beyond is one where sustainability and innovation go hand in hand.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Emirates-25.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 19:56:09.958112

COP30 had been called the “implementation COP(link is external)” by its Brazilian Presidency, and that sense of urgency was a theme running through discussions across the event.

Closing the gap between ambition and action

While world figures gathered at the main event in Belém to discuss updated national climate pledges, ending fossil fuels(link is external) and more, global climate leaders and many of the world’s leading organizations met in São Paulo for the Climate Action Innovation Zone.

At its flagship event, the Sustainable Innovation Forum(link is external), leaders explored the private sector’s role in driving a move to a low-carbon, nature-positive economy by closing the gap between climate ambition and real-world action.

Bridging divides, unlocking collective capacity and innovation toward shared goals were high on the agenda.

Collaboration to scale clean tech

A panel session titled ‘Innovation in action: advancing scalable and transformative solutions’ delved deeper into business’ role in advancing these objectives.

Underscoring COP30’s ‘Global Mutirão(link is external)’ concept — which is derived from the Indigenous Tupi-Guarani language and means “collective efforts(link is external)”, highlighting the combined push required to respond to the climate crisis — speakers discussed the need for collaboration to catalyze decarbonization.

Strategic alliances and cross-sector co-operation will be vital, Takajiro Ishikawa, President and CEO, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) America, told the panel, which also included Eliot Whittington, Chief Systems Change Officer, Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership and Nalin Agarwal, Founding Partner, Climate Collective.

“We can’t invent or reinvent everything,” he said of MHI, which has created a program to invest in start-ups and supplement its own research and development efforts.

Describing the range of companies the initiative supports, he gave the example of Fervo. The US-based geothermal energy start-up uses technology pioneered by the oil and gas sector to tap into reservoirs of hot rock beneath the Earth’s surface and turn them into 24-7 carbon-free energy sources for heat and power generation.

MHI’s financial and technological backing, he said, helped Fervo to commercialize rapidly.

This kind of collaboration, with different companies and sectors working together to pool knowledge and expertise, will be vital to achieve the speed and scale needed for decarbonization, the panel agreed.

Rethinking innovation to advance proven solutions

Many other transformative solutions that will sit at the heart of this effort are already within reach. The panelists discussed everything from self-healing concrete that extends the material’s lifespan to using pitch tar — a byproduct of oil refinery — as a feedstock for new material for the tire industry, a process pioneered by Monolith Materials, another company in which MHI has invested.

But as organizations including the International Energy Agency (IEA) have highlighted, many of the technologies that will help take so-called ‘hard-to-abate’ sectors to net zero — including hydrogen and carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) — are not yet available on the market at the scale needed(link is external).

For Ishikawa, part of solving this problem will be reapplying, rather than reinventing, key technologies.

CCUS, he said, is a solution MHI has been working on for the past 30 years and yet it has still “not captured the demand of the whole market”. But as AI hyperscalers look to balance robust environmental commitments with the need for reliable round-the-clock power for their data centers, gas-fired power with CO₂ capture is seeing renewed demand.

“So a 30-year-old technology may be coming to center stage,” he said. “That’s another example of how innovation finally meets the road.”

Bridging the clean tech ‘valley of death’

Speakers also discussed how partnerships between innovators, investors and policymakers can help decarbonization solutions move swiftly from pilot projects to global adoption — and avoid the commercialization gap that sees many promising technologies fail to scale due to a lack of funding and support.

There is a stark funding gap between proven and emerging technologies. BloombergNEF figures(link is external) show established solutions, including renewables and energy storage, drew $1.93 trillion in investment in 2024. Emerging technologies, including hydrogen, CCUS and nuclear, reached just $155 billion.

That analysis noted the public and private sectors alike need to do more to de-risk these technologies to ensure they have a meaningful impact before the end of the decade. The panelists’ discussions underscored this issue.

Partnerships, as well as policy stability, are critical for bridging the ‘valley of death’ for clean tech start-ups, Ishikawa said.

“Although it may have been proven at pilot scale or demonstration scale, for any industry to adopt a technology as part of their mix, there needs to be somebody that has a balance sheet to stand behind it,” he argued.

He cited the example of Houston-based start-up Cemvita, which MHI has invested in, and uses synthetic biology to help decarbonize heavy industries such as chemical manufacturing.

The company has recently signed an agreement to develop a sustainable aviation fuel facility(link is external) in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil — and the project highlights the transformative power of partnerships between innovators, business and policymakers, Ishikawa said.

At COP30, Brazil announced a commitment to quadruple production and use of sustainable fuels by 2035(link is external), along with Japan, India and other nations.

“This is company, local government and the will of the entrepreneur” working to create something new, Ishikawa added on the Cemvita project. “It really has to be all of the above to really get a technology off the ground.”

Ensuring promising technology has real impact

Closing the commercialization gap will be vital, with some estimates predicting that overall clean energy investment will need to rise to $4.5 trillion a year(link is external) by 2030 if the world is to have any chance of bringing warming down toward figures stated in net zero scenarios.

Innovation alone won’t be enough, panelists concluded. Real impact, they said, will depend on aligning technology readiness, market demand and enabling policy.

In a joint declaration, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) joined with Japan, Malaysia and several aviation stakeholders to demand that the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) remain the sole authority overseeing international aviation emissions. The group says the sector can’t meet its 2050 climate targets without coordinated rules and without a robust, unified carbon market.

CORSIA in focus

At the center of the debate is CORSIA, a global offsetting framework approved by nearly every country in the ICAO system. IATA and its allies argue that the system should function as aviation’s primary compliance mechanism, channeling billions into emission-reduction projects in developing economies.

According to the coalition, airlines will purchase large volumes of carbon credits through 2035, directing money to renewable energy, sustainable development programs and technologies that poorer nations could not otherwise access.

The group is also pushing governments to activate Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which allows countries to issue certificates authorizing international carbon trades. Only one country, Guyana, has issued such a letter, leaving the carbon supply pipeline constrained and slowing the launch of new climate projects.

Industry leaders warn that governments that pursue ticket taxes or unilateral levies will raise travel costs without meaningfully cutting pollution. They say such moves drain money away from actual emissions-reduction programs while hurting regions heavily dependent on air connectivity, particularly small island nations.

What’s next

Many climate analysts argue that offsets alone won’t stabilize aviation emissions, especially as airlines are seeing a demand rebound. The International Energy Agency notes that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production must expand multiple times to meet global climate targets.

Meanwhile, the European Union is moving ahead with its own aviation climate policies, including SAF mandates and carbon pricing, raising questions about whether ICAO can remain the exclusive rule-setter. The next challenge for CORSIA will be wider participation in Article 6 markets and proof that credits fund real, verified emissions reductions, not just paperwork.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/spencer-imbrock-QL0zAklHUz8-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 16:56:42.004569

Portage Energy shared details on its capabilities in sustainable waste conversion, presenting models that could fit Ghana’s environmental and economic needs.

Addressing the delegation, the Vice President reaffirmed government’s commitment to development partnerships that genuinely support national priorities.

She stressed that Ghana’s current economic and policy direction demands a new type of collaboration, one anchored in openness, responsibility, and shared value.

“In the economic and political climate we find ourselves in today, Ghana is not looking for relationships built on slogans or promises that do not translate into real results,” she said. “What we are seeking are partnerships that are truly transparent, partnerships that respect our national priorities, and partnerships that ensure that the Ghanaian people are the ultimate beneficiaries.”

She further noted that responsible waste management is no longer optional for a growing economy like Ghana’s.

“Waste management is directly tied to public health, environmental sustainability, industrial development, and even the attractiveness of our cities,” the Vice President explained.

“Any partnership we enter must therefore strengthen our national systems and contribute meaningfully to long-term development. We want solutions that do not merely look good on paper but deliver measurable outcomes for the country.”

The start of these fuel deliveries in October marked the company’s second and third deployments of blended SAF at a major U.S. airport in six months. In May, FedEx announced its first major U.S. SAF deployment at Los Angeles International Airport.

“Each executed agreement signals to fuel producers that airlines are willing and eager collaborators to help to scale the SAF market,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, chief sustainability officer and vice president of Environmental Affairs at FedEx, in a statement. “The aviation industry still faces a mismatch between available SAF supply and carrier demand, but we are encouraged by the early signs of increased SAF production globally this calendar year.”

At O’Hare, FedEx will receive a blend to include a total of 1 million gallons of neat SAF at a minimum 30% blend from Air bp. With its first fuel delivery in October, FedEx became the first U.S. all-cargo airline to purchase and deploy SAF at Chicago-O’Hare International Airport.

At Miami International Airport, FedEx has started to take delivery of around 3 million gallons of blended SAF at a 30% blend minimum from AEG.

Under current fuel standards, neat — or unblended — SAF is mixed with traditional jet fuel before use in an engine. Blended SAF is a “drop in” fuel, meaning airlines do not need to make changes to existing aircraft engines or fueling infrastructure to use it. By 2030, FedEx aims to obtain 30% of its fuel supply from alternative sources on a blended basis.

Aircraft modernization and other fuel savings initiatives enabled FedEx to avoid the use of 140 million gallons of jet fuel in FY 2024, resulting in $400 million in savings for the company. In FY 2024, FedEx achieved its previous goal of a 30% reduction in aircraft emissions intensity from a 2005 baseline.

Reinforcing private capital mobilization in Africa through blended finance

Africa faces a critical shortfall in climate and sustainable development financing. The Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development in Seville, Spain, reaffirmed the urgency of mobilizing private capital, primarily through blended finance models tailored to local contexts. However, fragmented markets, regulatory hurdles and low investor appetite continue to challenge scale and efficiency.

The launch of the Sevilla Platform for Action and increased cross-sector collaboration signal a new era of opportunity. If adequately supported, these efforts could shift how private investment is mobilized to meet Africa’s climate and sustainable development goals.",https://spglobal.scene7.com/is/image/spglobalcom/Corp_0606_DailyUpdateTech?$responsive$,N,,2025-11-19 23:56:47.764440

During the 69th Assembly of Presidents in Bangkok, the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) reported robust performance metrics for 2025, with international passenger traffic climbing 10% and cargo demand expanding 7% through September, both outpacing global averages.

However, beneath these encouraging numbers, industry executives are grappling with an increasingly complex operating environment.

The tariff turbulence

No issue loomed larger than the resurgence of tariffs, which AAPA Director General Subhas Menon characterized as an “entirely man-made” crisis. While aircraft and engines remain exempt, the raw materials and components that feed the aviation supply chain are not, creating cost increases that ultimately impact both airlines and passengers.

“Airlines are not against cost increases, only costs that don’t serve a useful purpose,” Menon noted, highlighting the impact of tariffs on both supply chains and consumer demand through inflation.

Charting a sustainable path

During the assembly, member airlines unanimously adopted ambitious sustainability targets, committing to 5% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) utilization by 2030. Thailand emerged as a regional leader, announcing plans to supply 2% SAF by 2026 and up to 8% by 2030 – notably without mandates or additional taxes on frequent flyers.

However, frustration simmered over the industry’s heavy reliance on SAF as the primary solution.

“We are asked to rely mostly on a hard-to-get commodity,” Menon observed, advocating instead for a balanced approach that gives equal weight to breakthrough technologies in propulsion and design.

Military conflicts force airlines to reroute and respond

Beyond economic pressures, airlines are also facing unprecedented operational challenges.

Military conflicts have closed crucial airspace over 14 countries in the past year, with Russian airspace restrictions forcing costly route diversions. Adding to safety concerns, military forces have been spoofing navigation satellite systems, creating what industry leaders see as an ironic threat from those meant to protect civilian aviation.

The assembly passed resolutions addressing these challenges, calling for regulatory harmonization, enhanced regional maintenance capabilities, and improved safety protocols for lithium battery transport, a growing concern as the use of electronic devices proliferates.

Resolutions passed at the 69th AAPA Assembly

During the assembly, APAC aviation leaders unanimously adopted resolutions focused on four pressing industry priorities:

Aviation sustainability: The assembly set an ambitious collective goal of reaching 5% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use by 2030. Leaders are calling on governments to put in place the policies and regulations needed to speed up SAF production and adopt fuel criteria that meet ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) standards. The resolution also encouraged states to implement ICAO-approved systems for tracking and registering SAF while supporting affordable production methods like co-processing.

Supply chain strengthening: Member airlines pushed for targeted investment incentives and streamlined regulations to boost regional maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) and manufacturing capabilities. The resolution highlights the importance of embracing circular economy practices, including recycling and reusing serviceable aircraft materials whenever possible.

Aviation safety – Lithium batteries: A separate resolution tackled the safe transport of lithium batteries, encouraging regulators to bring their practices in line with ICAO guidance for spare lithium batteries. The resolution emphasized the need for better data sharing and clearer public information about how passengers can safely carry and use lithium batteries.

Taxes and charges: Members agreed to urge regulators to avoid imposing taxes or charges on international air transport that are not directly cost-related or don’t align with ICAO guidance. The resolution warns against measures that place unnecessary financial pressure on airlines or hold back sustainable growth in air transport.

Looking ahead: the aviation industry cannot continue to be a “cash cow”

Despite turbulent times, AAPA members remain bullish on 2026, banking on resilient Asian economies and strong underlying demand for air travel.

The focus will now be on advancing safety and sustainability while strengthening supply chain resilience through closer collaboration with regulators and suppliers.

With his trademark knack for puns, Menon concluded his address with a touch of industry humor.

“This industry has been seen as a cash cow for the economy and states,” he said, “but it cannot be a cash cow if its udders are perpetually under repair.”",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/11/AAPA-Assembly-of-Presidents-2025.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 11:57:18.614967

Researchers found that partially suppressing genes in cyanobacteria improved their growth under stressful conditions.

The CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing tool is used to alter the genetic code of bacteria and other microbes.

This research aims to accelerate the production of affordable biofuels and recyclable plastics from renewable resources.

To make beer and wine, a microscopic fungus called yeast consumes sugars in fruits or grains and converts them into ethanol (alcohol) and carbon dioxide. But the microbe yeast cannot tolerate different stressful conditions, said Carrie Eckert, leader of the Synthetic Biology Group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in a recent talk to Friends of ORNL.

One of the goals of the Center for Bioenergy Innovation (CBI) at ORNL, which is one of four Department of Energy Office of Science Bioenergy Research Centers, is to alter the natural behavior of plant cells and bacteria such as Clostridium thermocellum to enable them to tolerate the industrial processes needed to make ample amounts of affordable products, such as sustainable aviation fuel.

CBI, she said, has made small amounts of sustainable aviation fuel using engineered strains of the Clostridium thermocellum bacteria. These microbes make ethanol by breaking down the tough plant material in sustainable woody biomass from poplar trees or grassy biomass from fast-growing switchgrass.

Eckert, a recently appointed chief science officer at CBI, told the FORNL audience about recent research she performed with three researchers at the University of Colorado at Boulder using genetic engineering. By tweaking genes in certain bacteria and exposing them to temperature and light conditions different from what they prefer, the researchers found that the bacteria surprisingly improved their growth while adapting to new conditions they were not expected to tolerate.

Their research results were published in the March 21 issue of the journal, “Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.” Their experiments were performed using Synechococcus cyanobacteria, better known as blue-green algae.

This one-celled species is the world’s oldest organism to perform photosynthesis as it grows during the day in warm, carbon-rich waters in oceans, rivers and lakes. Blue-green algae, which has enriched the atmosphere with the oxygen humans need to survive, is actively being researched as a promising source for making sustainable aviation fuel.

Eckert and her colleagues found that repressing, or partially shutting down the expression of, all genes in their cyanobacteria sample so they make less protein caused its cells to grow better under two environmental stressors. They were temperatures colder than the 37 degrees Celsius they prefer and white light shone continuously on them, replacing the daily cycle of light and dark the organisms are used to.

The new knowledge could lead to the use by CBI of renewable microbes and plant cells from poplar trees and switchgrass (two non-edible plants that grow fast) for demonstrating the scaled-up industrial production of affordable biofuels and recyclable plastics with improved properties.

To change the building blocks of the bacterial cells’ genetic code, Eckert has used the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tool developed by Jennifer Doudna, an American scientist, and Emmanuelle Charpentier, a French scientist. The two women won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their innovative work based on the discovery that bacteria use this tool to protect themselves from a virus that previously attacked them.

Eckert gave a short tutorial to the FORNL audience about two types of CRISPR tools. She said that the naturally occurring defense system found in bacteria is known as CRISPR, an acronym for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats. When a virus attacks a bacterium, it captures a small piece of the virus’s DNA and stores it in its own genome, creating a genetic memory. If the same virus attacks again, the bacterium recognizes and destroys it.

To locate a specific gene to be altered, Eckert said that scientists create a guide RNA that perfectly matches the DNA code of the target. Like GPS for car drivers, the gRNA guides the Cas9 protein it’s a part of to the exact spot on the DNA molecule. That’s where the Cas9 protein uses its molecular scissors to make a precise cut, removing the undesired DNA from the gene.

Scientists can edit a problematic gene by inserting a new piece of DNA at the cut to turn the old, defective gene into a new, corrected one.

It’s sort of like cut, copy and paste in word processing. This technique has been used by medical researchers to correct genetic mutations that cause diseases like sickle cell anemia.

Eckert noted that she has used CRISPR to genetically engineer yeast and E. coli bacteria.

However, in the research she performed recently with her UC Boulder colleagues, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) was employed. This gene silencing technique uses a modified CRISPR-Cas system to repress gene expression without cutting out a piece of DNA. Instead, this tool for gene regulation knocks down, rather than completely knocks out, a gene’s activity.

The mutated Cas9 protein, which is unable to cleave the DNA, can be guided to the target gene where it interferes with the gene’s expression, silencing it.

“The altered Cas9 protein blocks the RNA polymerase from copying and transcribing the gene enough to repress its expression,” she noted. As a result, the gene makes little or no protein.

Eckert said she and her colleagues have devised a method to determine which edited genes are associated with particular traits, such as the ability to grow. The method involves repressing all the genes in the bacterial sample and exposing them to environmental stressors.

She and her colleagues used the CRISPRi gene-silencing tool and a large library of molecular guides they made to understand how photosynthetic bacteria respond to stresses such as changes in light and temperature.

“We built a library of almost 33,000 guide RNAs for targeting all the genes in the genome of our cyanobacteria samples,” Eckert said. Ten guide RNAs ping each gene, producing different levels of knockdown of gene expression.

Through sequencing of bacterial genes in the targeted cyanobacteria that survived the “high-throughput” guide RNA pinging of the genes and through computational methods, the scientists could determine which genes improve growth and which ones inhibit it.

The researchers then exposed the cyanobacteria to a lower temperature than the cells thrive on and to white light instead of the different levels of red and blue light they use for photosynthesis depending on their depth in the water. When the cyanobacteria were exposed to the lower temperature and red or blue light, “they got really sick,” Eckert said. “They fall out of the population.”

She later explained that cyanobacteria have circadian clock genes. They enable the algae to prepare for the predictable daily cycle of light and dark, scheduling photosynthesis during the day and nitrogen fixation at night.

When the scientists exposed a sample of cyanobacteria to continuous white light and colder temperatures than they prefer (22 degrees Celsius instead of 37 degrees), Eckert said they found that the bacterial growth improved.

The explanation? Because the cyanobacteria were exposed to continuous white light instead of the daily light-and-dark cycle of red and blue light they need to obtain carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide to make the sugar enabling them to grow, the circadian clock genes ceased to use the organism’s energy to make proteins, giving it extra energy to spur its growth.

In this research, they found that even partial suppression of all the genes in a genome improved the microbes’ ability to grow while adapting to environmental stresses.

""This powerful technique delivers a faster, more comprehensive way to influence microbial traits for biotechnology,” she said. “It provides more insights into gene functions than traditional genome editing. It accelerates our ability to augment microbes to produce desired fuels, chemicals and materials.”

CBI researchers plan to apply this novel technique to optimize the growth of previously identified microbes used to make biofuels and bioproducts by finding ways to help them acclimate to stressful conditions.

Eckert’s talk to FORNL was titled “The Role of Synthetic Biology in the Realization of the Bioeconomy.” She explained that research at CBI supports its goal to find ways to help create a circular bioeconomy, which will use renewable biological resources to produce large quantities of biofuels and better chemicals while minimizing waste and carbon dioxide emissions.

This approach might replace the current linear system of taking, making, and wasting materials based on finite fossil resources (e.g., using petroleum to make plastics that cannot be recycled and end up in the landfill).

In answers to questions, Eckert said fuels and chemicals that are industrially produced by microbes (often by fermentation of renewable biomass) include acetone, butanol, ethanol, insulin and 2,3-Butanediol, which has been used in printing inks, perfumes, and pharmaceuticals. But she added, while the production of these substances has been scaled up, it is often not very profitable.","https://www.oakridger.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/18/NOAK/87333295007-carrie-eckert-ornl-credit-1-copy.jpg?crop=1378,775,x0,y66&width=1378&height=775&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-19 11:57:23.897303

Founded by Luis de Ita Maubant and Reiner van Gageldonk, the Norwegian startup has developed a platform that combines big data, artificial intelligence, and geospatial analysis to predict where and when charging demand will occur. By monitoring over half a million charging stations in Europe and analysing millions of charging sessions in detail – from traffic flows to land use models, from demographic data to vehicle registrations, all the way to competing services – SurplusMap identifies the micro-markets in which chargers will reach sustainable usage levels and flags those in which this will not happen, avoiding wasted investments.

Going beyond static maps and driving toward predictive infrastructure intelligence, the platform enables operators and investors to make decisions on future implementation. ""We have created SurplusMap to make electrification work in practice, not just on paper,"" CEO Luis de Ita Maubant tells Renewable Matter. ""With unique data and artificial intelligence, we can guide the expansion of charging stations and prepare to integrate them into tomorrow's energy system.""

As increasing numbers of charging stations are installed across Europe, the problem of making the grid work economically remains. The risk is that an indiscriminate race to installation might lead to an excess of supply and loss-making infrastructure.

In Northern Europe, various charging point operators, such as supermarket chains and retailers, already use SurplusMap to optimise networks, while Berlin-Brandenburg Airport is collaborating with the startup to manage the charging of cars, taxis, and HGVs.

Supported by EIT Urban Mobility, the company sees charging hubs as assets for the energy grid, not only in the service of motorists but also as contributors to the stability of the electric system. In partnership with the city of Oslo, the startup is researching how charging models impact the grid and how hubs can become balancing instruments. A pilot project, planned for 2026, aims to prove how public charging can support both citizens and the energy system.

The agreement, finalised on the sidelines of the Dubai Airshow, links the UAE’s largest carrier with its primary fuel provider at a time when airlines worldwide are under pressure to cut emissions and secure long-term access to lower-carbon fuels.

The MoU lays out a framework for feasibility studies that will assess what it would take to establish a reliable SAF supply chain in Dubai. These studies will examine supply infrastructure, potential local production, blending requirements and the commercial conditions needed to ensure long-term viability. A joint steering committee will guide the evaluation, signalling a coordinated effort between two of the UAE’s most influential aviation players.

SAF is a certified drop-in fuel that works with existing aircraft and airport systems. It can be blended with conventional jet fuel at up to 50% and, in its unblended form, can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%. This makes it one of the most practical near-term solutions for the aviation sector as broader decarbonisation technologies continue to develop.

Emirates has been active in UAE-level SAF initiatives, contributing to the General Policy for Sustainable Aviation Fuel and participating in committees focused on biofuels, hydrogen and next-generation aviation fuels. The policy aims to position the UAE as a regional centre for alternative fuels, with a target of 700 million litres of SAF production by 2030.

The airline has been running SAF demonstration flights to test operational readiness. In January 2023, it operated a Boeing 777 flight using 100% SAF in one engine. This was followed by the first A380 demonstration flight using 100 per cent SAF in one engine in November 2023.

A decisive push in U.S. aviation decarbonization

A new multi-year supply agreement between DHL Express and Phillips 66 is set to reshape the availability of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) on the U.S. West Coast. The companies have signed a contract for more than 240,000 metric tons of SAF over three years, a scale that places the deal among the largest for any American air cargo operator.

The fuel will support DHL’s air operations through deliveries at Los Angeles International Airport, the logistics group’s main West Coast gateway, with planned expansion to San Francisco and other regional airports. DHL will use a book-and-claim system to account for emissions reductions across its global network, a mechanism increasingly adopted by aviation customers seeking verifiable decarbonization pathways.

At its core, the agreement reflects the intensifying pressure on logistics and freight companies to decarbonize hard-to-abate transport segments while keeping pace with tightening regulatory expectations. With investors, regulators and corporate customers demanding clearer Scope 3 strategies, the expansion of credible SAF supply has become a pivotal element in global freight planning.

Production anchored at a flagship renewable fuels complex

Phillips 66 will produce the SAF at its Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex in California, a facility undergoing a major conversion to manufacture renewable fuels at scale. The plant has the capacity to produce 150 million gallons of neat SAF annually, allowing the company to supply long-term commitments such as DHL’s.

RELATED ARTICLE: DHL Leads Sustainable Transport with Hydrogen Trucks in Germany

For DHL’s operations, the supply volume translates into an expected reduction of roughly 737,000 metric tons of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions over the contract period. The company has framed the agreement as a key lever in advancing its net-zero 2050 strategy, which relies heavily on securing consistent access to lower-carbon fuel.

Travis Cobb, EVP Global Operations and Aviation at DHL Express, said: “This agreement with Phillips 66 is a significant milestone for DHL Express as we work towards our sustainability goals. By securing a reliable supply of SAF, we are not only reducing our carbon emissions – and those within our customers’ supply chains – but also setting a precedent for the logistics and air cargo industries in the U.S. Our collaboration with Phillips 66 underscores our commitment to a lower-carbon future and demonstrates the importance of sustainable practices in our operations.”

Phillips 66 leadership echoed the strategic rationale. Brian Mandell, EVP Marketing and Commercial, stated: “This agreement between Phillips 66 and DHL demonstrates our shared commitment to SAF market leadership and credible action in the growing SAF industry. Through our global renewable fuel business, we are committed to supporting DHL and our customers in achieving their decarbonization goals. Our agreement with DHL showcases cross-industry collaboration, and together, we aim to drive progress toward sustainable solutions in the aviation sector.”

A growing global SAF portfolio

For DHL, the U.S. deal strengthens a portfolio of SAF partnerships secured across Europe, the Americas and Asia Pacific since 2021. The company’s GoGreen Plus service, which enables corporate customers to cut Scope 3 emissions through SAF usage, depends on sustained access to high-integrity fuel supply. As more multinational shippers begin accounting for logistics-related emissions within procurement decisions, scalable SAF access has become a differentiator for aviation-heavy supply chain providers.

The agreement also highlights the broader policy and market dynamics surrounding renewable fuels. U.S. federal and state incentives have begun accelerating SAF production, while forthcoming mandates in Europe and rising voluntary demand from corporate buyers are shaping the global competitive landscape. Producers capable of delivering consistent volumes at verifiable carbon intensity levels are positioning themselves to capture a growing share of the market.

What executives should watch

For aviation, logistics and energy executives, the DHL–Phillips 66 deal points to a tightening interplay between corporate climate commitments, regional policy incentives and the maturing economics of SAF production. It also illustrates the role of cross-sector alliances in scaling alternatives to conventional jet fuel at a pace aligned with climate targets.

As U.S. and international regulators consider stricter aviation emissions frameworks, supply agreements of this size show how major carriers are preparing for a future where lower-carbon fuel becomes a structural, rather than optional, element of fleet strategy. And as global trade continues to rely on rapid air freight capacity, the sustainability of these routes will depend on how quickly the SAF ecosystem expands beyond isolated, project-based volumes into consistent regional supply chains.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DHL-Phillips-66-to-Deliver-Major-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-Supply-for-U.S.-Cargo-Routes.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 11:58:21.349500

This regulatory backbone, combined with airport sustainability certifications from the Airport Carbon Accreditation program and corporate net zero pledges from carriers like Lufthansa and Air France, crystallised demand signals across the value chain.

MARKET DRIVERS

EU Regulatory Mandates Create Non-Discretionary Demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The European Union’s binding regulatory framework has fundamentally shifted sustainable aviation fuel from an optional mitigation tool to a compulsory input for all commercial flight operators is leveraging the growth of Europe's sustainable aviation fuel market. As per the finalised ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation adopted in 2023, fuel suppliers must ensure that 2% of all aviation fuel delivered at EU airports in 2025 consists of sustainable aviation fuel, with incremental increases to 6% by 2030 and 20% by 2035. This legal obligation applies uniformly across all 27 member states and covers over 600 commercial airports, generating a baseline of structural demand irrespective of ticket prices or passenger volumes. According to Eurostat, EU airports handled more than 8.4 billion litres of jet fuel in 2024, implying an immediate requirement for at least 168 million litres of sustainable aviation fuel in 2025 alone. The regulation also introduces a credit trading mechanism, allowing compliant suppliers to monetise over fulfilment, thereby creating financial incentives for early investment. These interlocking policies eliminate market ambiguity and compel airlines, fuel suppliers, and producers to secure long-term offtake agreements, which establish a policy-driven demand floor that anchors the entire value chain.

Corporate Air Travel Decarbonization Commitments Accelerate Offtake Agreements

The voluntary but binding corporate climate strategies are the direct procurement of sustainable aviation fuel across Europe’s business and premium travel, which is additionally expected o elevate the growth of Europe's sustainable aviation fuel market. As per the Corporate Jet Commitment launched under the World Economic Forum, over 70 European multinational corporations, including Unilever, Siemens and Novo Nordisk, have pledged to power 100% of their business air travel with sustainable aviation fuel by 2030. These commitments translate into multi-year offtake agreements that de-risk producer investments. In 2024, Scandinavian Airlines signed a 10-year deal with Neste to supply 50 million litres annually, while Lufthansa Group secured 75 million litres per year from multiple producers through 2030.

MARKET RESTRAINTS

Feedstock Scarcity and Competition from Other Renewable Sectors Limit Scalability

The limited availability of certified low-carbon feedstocks and intense competition from other bio-based industries are majorly limiting the growth of Europe's sustainable aviation fuel market. According to the European Environment Agency, the total sustainable residual oil and fat supply in the EU, including used cooking oil and animal tallow, amounted to approximately 3.2 million metric tons in 2024, equivalent to only 5 billion litres of potential fuel, far below projected demand. Simultaneously, the renewable diesel sector is driven by the EU’s Fit for 55 transport decarbonization package that consumes over 85% of these same feedstocks, as reported by the International Energy Agency. Moreover, sustainability criteria under the Renewable Energy Directive II restrict the use of crop-based feedstocks, eliminating potential alternatives like camelina or carinata at scale.

High Production Costs and Lack of Economies of Scale Impede Commercial Viability

The advanced systems are more expensive than conventional systems, primarily due to immature production technologies and the absence of large-scale dedicated facilities. The high production cost and lack of sufficient support from the government bodies are also degrading the growth of the European sustainable aviation fuel market. This four to seven-fold premium renders the fuel economically unviable without subsidies or premium offtake agreements. According to the International Council on Clean Transportation, achieving cost parity requires production scales exceeding 1 billion litres per plant, levels not yet realised in the region. The capital intensity is further exacerbated by the need for specialised hydrotreatment or Fischer-Tropsch units that cannot be easily retrofitted from existing refineries.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

Emergence of Power to Liquid Fuel Pathways Offers Long-Term Decarbonization Leverage

The power to produce liquid sustainable aviation fuel produced from green hydrogen and captured CO₂ using renewable electricity is a substantial opportunity to leverage new opportunities for the growth oof oftathe inable aviation fuel market. In 2024, the German government launched the H2Global initiative, allocating 2 billion euros to support kerosene production, while Spain’s Repsol began construction of a 100,000 litre per year pilot plant in Bilbao. The International Renewable Energy Agency estimates that power-to-liquid costs could fall below 1.50 euros per litre by 2035 with scaled electrolysis and falling renewable power prices.

Airport Infrastructure Modernisation Enables Blending and Distribution at Scale

The systematic retrofitting of European airport fueling systems through seamless integration into existing logistics is another opportunity prompting the growth of Europe's sustainable aviation fuel market. The aviation fueling operates through centralised hydrant systems that require precise compatibility and quality assurance. Amsterdam Schiphol and Oslo Gardermoen have already implemented dedicated sustainable aviation fuel hydrant lines by enabling a drop in use without aircraft modifications. These investments reduce handling complexity and transaction costs, making large-scale adoption operationally feasible. Furthermore, standardised quality protocols under ASTM D7566 ensure fuel integrity across the supply chain.

MARKET CHALLENGES

Uncertainty in International Carbon Credit Recognition Undermines Investment Certainty

The lack of global harmonisation in carbon accounting for sustainable aviation fuel creates significant financial and strategic risk for European producers and airlines, which is a challenging factor for the growth of the sustainable aviation fuel market. Under the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s CORSIA scheme, which governs international flight emissions, only fuels achieving 10% or greater lifecycle CO₂ reduction qualify for emissions offsetting credits. However, the methodology for calculating those reductions differs from the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive, leading to discrepancies in recognised carbon savings. According to the International Air Transport Association, a sustainable aviation fuel batch deemed to offer an 80% reduction under EU rules may be credited with only 60% under CORSIA due to divergent land use change and product allocation assumptions. This inconsistency complicates long-term offtake pricing and discourages cross-border investments. Moreover,non-EUU jurisdictions like the United States apply their own lifecycle models under the Inflation Reduction Act, which further fragments the global incentive landscape.

Limited Public Acceptance of Novel Feedstocks Triggers Policy and Permitting Delays

The deployment of next-generation sustainable aviation fuel pathways is frequently obstructed by public scepticism and regulatory caution regarding novel feedstocks, such as municipal solid waste or forest residues. Although the Renewable Energy Directive permits advanced feedstocks, local permitting authorities often delay or reject plant proposals due to concerns over air emissions, odour or perceived competition with waste recycling. As per the European Biomass Association, over 40% of proposed waste-to-fuel projects in France and Italy faced community opposition in 2023, resulting in average permitting delays of 18 months. Additionally, the EU’s updated Industrial Emissions Directive imposes stringent Best Available Techniques requirements that increase capital costs for gasification and pyrolysis units. These social and regulatory headwinds slow the transition from pilot to commercial scale, particularly for non-lipid pathways that are essential to meet 2035 policy targets.

REPORT COVERAGE

SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS

By Fuel Type Insights

The biofuel segment was the largest by capturing 58.3% of the European sustainable aviation fuel market share in 2024 due to its commercial readiness, regulatory acceptance,c, and compatibility with existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure. Nearly all sustainable aviation fuel consumed in Europe in 2024 was derived from lipid-based feedstock, primarily used cooking oil, animal fats and non-food vegetable oil,,s that processed via established pathways like HEFA. Airlines, such as KLM and Lufthansa, have executed more than 500,000 commercial flights using bio-derived blends since 2020 without engine modifications. The fuel’s drop in nature allows immediate integration into the current jet fuel supply chain with no capital expenditure at airports. Furthermore, the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation explicitly recognises biofuels as compliance tools from day one,whilee while pathways remain in demonstration phases.

The power to liquid segment is anticipated to grow at the fastest CAGR of 11.2% during the forecast period, with its potential for near-total decarbonization and alignment with the continent’s renewable electricity ambitions. As per the International Renewable Energy Agency, Europe installed over 20 gigawatts of new renewable capacity in 2024 alone, providing a growing surplus for fuel production. The European Commission’s Innovation Fund allocated 450 million euros in early 2024 specifically for power-to-liquid demonstration facilities, including projects by Siemens Energy and SAS. Additionally, the EU’s Net Zero Industry Act identifies electrofuels as strategic and mandates streamlined permitting for production sites.

By Technology Insights

The HEFA SPK technology segment was the largest by holding a prominent share of the European sustainable aviation fuel market in 2024 due to its commercial validation, feedstock flexibility, and certification under ASTM D7566 since 2011. This pathway converts triglycerides from waste oils and animal fats into hydrocarbons chemically identical to conventional jet fuel, enabling up to 50% blending without aircraft modifications. According to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, over 98% of sustainable aviation fuel flights operated in Europe between 2020 and 22024 utilised HEFA SPK blends. The technology benefits from repurposed hydrotreating infrastructure originally built for renewable diesel, allowing faster scale-up than novel processes. Furthermore, the European Commission’s delegated acts under ReFuelEU explicitly include HEFA SPK in the list of eligible fuels for compliance credits from 2025 onward.

The Fischer Tropsch SPK segment is swiftly emerging at the fastest CAGR owing to its ability to utilise non-lipid feedstocks such as municipal solid waste and green hydrogen-derived syngas. According to the European Biomass Association, over 250 million metric tons of recoverable municipal and industrial waste are generated annually in the EU, offering a vast untapped resource base. In 2024, Finland’s Fulcrum BioEnergy Europe partnered with British Airways to commission a 100 million litre per year FT SPK plant in the UK using household waste as feedstock. Similarly, Germany’s Sasol and LanzaJet are piloting integrated biomass gasification and FT synthesis units under Horizon Europe funding.

By End Use Insights

The large airlines segment accounted for a dominant share of the European sustainable aviation fuel market in 2024 due to their extensive route network, high fuel bburdenand public sustainability accountability. These airlines face intense scrutiny from investors, passengers, and regulators to meet the Science-Basedgets Targets initiative validated net-zero commitments. As a resuresultthey have signed the bulk of Europe’s long-term offtake agreement, including Lufthansa’s 75 million litre annual deal with Neste and Air France’s partnership with TotalEnergies for 100 million litres per year by 2026. The European Commission’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive further mandates large firms to disclose scope 3 emissions, including fuel choices, amplifying reputational stakes. Additionally, their purchasing power enables volume discounts and co-investment in production facilities, making sustainable aviation fuel economically more feasible than for smaller operators. This combination of scale compliance pressure and strategic procurement secures large airlines as the dominant end-use segment.

The non-scheduled operators segment is gaining huge traction by showcasing the fastest CAGR of 36.2% during the forecast period, with private jet charter services, cargo airlines and air ambulance providers— ree fastest growing end users of sustainable aviation fuel in Europe, driven by premium client expectations and niche operational advantages. Companies like VistaJet and NetJets have responded by mandating 30 to 100% sustainable aviation fuel blends on all European departures. Cargo operators such as DHL Express have committed to powering all intra-European freight flights with sustainable aviation fuel by 2027 under its GoGreen program. The International Air Transport Association notes that non-scheduled operators benefit from flexible scheduling and smaller fuel volumes, enabling easier logistics for premium fuel sourcing. Moreover, their ability to pass costs directly to clients avoids the fare sensitivity faced by commercial airlines.

Nestlé, Mars Urge EU: Don’t Delay the Deforestation Law

Major brands — including Nestlé, Mars Wrigley, Ferrero and others — asked EU lawmakers to avoid new delays to the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR). They warn that a ‘stop-the-clock’ or open-ended review would extend legal uncertainty, penalize early movers, and undermine the EU’s credibility with producer countries. The European Commission still plans entry into force end-2025, with a 6-month enforcement grace for large firms and SMEs covered end-2026; it also proposed simplifying reporting by focusing statements on companies that first place products on the EU market. Brands support streamlining but say some tweaks could add burdens for downstream players. They propose: only first placers file statements, while all companies must keep due-diligence systems, act on substantiated concerns, and keep supplier/buyer records. A Parliament vote on the package is next week. The EUDR covers commodities like palm oil, beef, timber, coffee, cocoa, rubber, soy (and products like leather, chocolate, tires, furniture).

‘Existential Threat’: Small Doses of Ocean Plastic Can Kill Marine Life

New research led by Ocean Conservancy warns that ocean plastics pose an “existential threat” to marine biodiversity — and that very small amounts can be fatal. Scientists analyzed 10,412 autopsies: 1,537 seabirds (57 species), 1,306 sea turtles (7 species) and 7,569 marine mammals (31 species). Plastics were present at death in 47% of turtles, ~33% of seabirds, and 12% of marine mammals. For seabirds like Atlantic puffins, <3 sugar cubes of plastic implies a 90% chance of death; for turtles (e.g., loggerheads), just over two baseballs; for marine mammals (e.g., harbor porpoises), about one football. Rubber & hard plastics are especially deadly for seabirds; soft plastics & fishing gear hit marine mammals hardest; turtles are vulnerable to both. An estimated 11 million tonnes of plastic enter the ocean each year — roughly a truckload a minute. Authors say these thresholds can guide science-based targets and policy.

Irish Direct Air Capture (DAC) company, NEG8 Carbon, has signed a contract for Phase 1 of a major project in the UK to develop large-scale Sustainable Aviation Fuel (eSAF) production using a low-carbon energy source. This paves the way for economic production of eSAF at scale, which is critical for decarbonisation of the aviation industry.

The CO₂ provided via DAC will be combined with green hydrogen and nuclear-generated electricity to create eSAF in a specialised process. The eSAF produced will save over 90% emissions compared to traditional jet fuel and will comply with international SAF mandates.

The project, known as Eq.flight, will be led by Equilibrion who are pioneering the drive to decarbonise aviation using low-carbon nuclear energy through small and advanced modular reactors.

Equilibrion was awarded £1 million for Phase 1 of the Eq.flight project as part of the UK Department of Transport’s Advanced Fuel Fund (AFF) 2025 investment of £63m in 17 clean aviation initiatives, bringing to £198m the total value of state investment in this area since 2022.

NEG8 Carbon’s DAC technology is particularly suitable for this project as it uses low-carbon heat and electricity from nuclear, which greatly reduces the cost and increases efficiency of the DAC process.

NEG8 Carbon Founder & Managing Director, Ray Naughton, said:

“This positions NEG8 Carbon as one of the leaders in the field to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel using Direct Air Capture of CO₂. The potential in this market is driven by the EU and UK government mandates to airlines to use more SAF in their fuel mix progressing to 70% in the EU by 2050. This creates a global SAF market with a value of $400 billion by 2050. NEG8 Carbon is now positioned to be a major player in this market.”

Philip Rogers and Caroline Longman, Co-founders and Directors at Equilibrion said:

“We are committed to developing solutions that enable the aviation sector to offer lower emission flights to customers around the world by leveraging low-carbon nuclear electricity and heat. Power-to-liquids powered by advanced nuclear reactors offers the potential for the scale of production needed to make a major impact on climate change.”

What is Direct Air Capture (DAC)?

Direct Air Capture is a technology that extracts carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the air. NEG8 Carbon’s DAC technology works by using fans to draw in large quantities of air and passing it through NEG8’s revolutionary low-cost CO₂ extraction system. The extracted CO₂ is either permanently stored underground or used practically in carbon utilisation processes.

What is eSAF?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is produced from a broad range of materials and feedstocks, whereas eSAF is made from CO₂ captured from the air and green hydrogen. DAC is the only technology which can provide a large-scale source of green CO₂ at million tonne scale at the eSAF production location.

The United Arab Emirates signalled a decisive shift in aviation policy by announcing that all national carriers will soon operate under a binding requirement to blend sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, into every flight departing the country. A voluntary pledge of one percent SAF by 2031 already exists, yet regulators now intend to convert that guideline into law well before the decade closes. Moving from encouragement to obligation will send a powerful market signal to fuel suppliers and investors.

Building a Domestic SAF Ecosystem

The government is backing the policy with infrastructure. A new plant in the Fujairah Oil Industry Zone will repurpose waste cooking oil and other residues into 125 million litres of certified SAF each year, with plans to double this output during a second construction phase. Additional joint ventures, including a proposed facility in Hong Kong with international partners, demonstrate how the UAE is positioning itself as a hub for regional SAF distribution.

Non-Obvious Insight: Supply Chain Resilience

Beyond emissions reduction the mandate quietly strengthens national energy security. By turning local waste streams into jet fuel the country diversifies feedstocks and lowers exposure to global crude price fluctuations, creating a resilient aviation supply chain that can support growth even during volatile markets.

Economic Considerations

SAF currently costs more than conventional kerosene, yet the government is exploring tailored incentives such as loan guarantees and carbon credit allocations to smooth the cost curve for airlines. Early scale benefits often unlock rapid price declines, a trend previously observed in solar and battery sectors.

Global Influence

By embedding sustainability directly into flight operations the UAE establishes a reference model that other tourism driven economies can emulate. International airlines landing in Abu Dhabi or Dubai will experience established SAF supply chains, encouraging broader adoption.

Conclusion

With firm policy, investment momentum, and a strategic view of resource resilience, the UAE is charting a profitable and sustainable course for aviation.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-13-1.svg,N,,2025-11-19 10:56:38.428625

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?
What is Australia's stance on Sustainable Aviation Fuel?","Passenger and commercial flights operating out of Singapore are set to become more expensive after the announcement of a world-first sustainable fuel tax added onto ticket prices.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) recently revealed it would introduce a ""Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy"" for flights booked from April 1, 2026 and due for departure from the South-East Asian country from October 1.

""The introduction of the SAF Levy marks a major step forward in Singapore's effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub,"" CAAS director-general Han Kok Juan said.

""It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub.

""We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.""

Two of Australia's three major commercial airlines — Qantas and Jetstar — offer flights to Singapore.

There are various other international carriers that also fly from Singapore to Australia, including Singapore Airlines, Scoot, Emirates and British Airways.

So, how will the price hikes impact Australians and could a similar tax be implemented here? Let's break it down.

Price increases will be linked to flight distances

Singapore says the SAF Levy will be implemented in a bid to align with the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) goal of net zero carbon emissions in global aviation by 2050.

In 2024, the country launched a sustainable aviation plan to reduce domestic airport emissions from 2019 levels by 20 per cent by 2030.

As part of that plan, the CAAS said the new levy ""is set based on the volume of SAF needed to meet the 1 per cent SAF target for 2026 and the projected price premium of SAF over conventional jet fuel"".

It means travellers on flights departing Singapore will be charged more, depending on how far away their destination is and how much fuel is expected to be used during the journey.

The levy will only be listed as a separate tax charge on airline ticket receipts for people who begin their journey in Singapore.

Travellers transiting through the country or transferring to another airline during a stopover in Singapore will not have to pay extra, the CAAS's Chief Sustainability Officer Daniel Ng told the ABC.

""For flights with multiple stops, the SAF Levy applicable is based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore,"" a CAAS statement said.

To determine how much to charge, the CAAS said all destinations were grouped into four geographic categories based on distance. The amount also varies based on whether the passenger flies economy or premium.

Travellers flying from Singapore to other parts of South-East Asia in an economy seat will be charged the least, at just $S1 ($1.18) on top of the cost of their ticket.

Travellers to Australia will face a $3.30 fee for economy and $13.21 for premium cabin seats, while passengers who fly in business or first class to North, Central or South America will be charged the most — an additional $49.08.

Australian and international travellers have increasingly been visiting or returning from Singapore amid a rebound in air travel following the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

At least 39,590 short-term visitors were recorded entering Australia from Singapore as to September this year, up from 31,370 and 31,140 at the same time in 2024 and 2023 respectively, ABS data shows.

The CAAS said the levy would also include per-kilogram charges for shipping cargo through Singapore, ranging from $S0.01 to $S0.15 depending on geographic category, and private jet operators would be charged a fee per-aircraft of between $47.19 and $7,668 based on the type and size of plane.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) says that an SAF is ""a liquid fuel currently used in commercial aviation which reduces CO2 emissions by up to 80 per cent.""

It can be made from various sources, including oils, fats, green waste and non-food crops or via a synthetic process that draws carbon from the air, the organisation says.

Loading...

""It is ‘sustainable’ because the raw feedstock does not compete with food crops or water supplies, or is responsible for forest degradation,"" the IATA says on its website.

""Whereas fossil fuels add to the overall level of CO2 by emitting carbon that had been previously locked away, SAF recycles the CO2 which has been absorbed by the biomass used in the feedstock during the course of its life.""

At least 175 airports worldwide are already distributing SAF to commercial carriers and more than $103 billion has been announced in investments in the sector, according to the ICAO.

Will Australia adopt this levy?

Australian airlines and their customers are currently not subject to mandatory flight sustainability costs.

Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin Australia do, however, offer travellers the option to voluntarily pay extra to offset their individual carbon emissions made during a flight.

Neil Hansford, an aviation expert and the CEO of Strategic Aviation Solutions, told the ABC he expected Australia to watch Singapore's SAF Levy implementation closely in determining whether to create a similar tax in the future.

""If it's going to be based on the fuel, they'll have to apply an excise … They'll either increase the excise or do a per tonne, per litre rate.""

Australia's major airlines have previously voiced opposition to government-enforced measures that could increase costs for passengers.

In submissions made to a 2024 Senate committee inquiry examining a proposal for airlines to compensate their customers for delayed or cancelled flights, Qantas, Virgin Australia and Rex Airlines all argued against fee-based measures, saying they do not improve the customer experience.

What is Australia's stance on Sustainable Aviation Fuel?

In recent years, the federal government and Australia's commercial airlines have been actively pursuing increased sustainability in the country's aviation sector.

In 2021, the Bioenergy Australia advocacy group reported that production costs were the biggest challenge to airlines opting out of mostly using traditional jet fuel during their flights.

A ""Bioenergy Roadmap"" released in that year by the federal government predicted that ""with increased target focus"", up to 45 per cent of the aviation market could be fuelled by sustainable options by the 2050s.

Bioenergy Australia has also previously proposed the creation of a ""Singapore-Australia-New Zealand Jet Council"" to lobby governments into supporting aviation sustainability across airlines, fuel suppliers, airports and aircraft manufacturers.

Qantas announced in May this year that almost two million litres of SAF had been imported into Australia, in a joint commercial deal made with Sydney Airport and Ampol.

""The fuel could power the equivalent of 900 flights from Sydney to Auckland on Qantas and Jetstar’s 737 aircraft, reducing the resulting carbon emissions from those flights by a total estimated 3,400 tonnes,"" a Qantas statement said at the time.

""This is roughly equivalent to the annual emissions generated by 800 cars.""

In a statement to the ABC on Tuesday, a Qantas Group spokesperson said that Qantas and Jetstar supported the use of SAF to reduce emissions.

“The availability and adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel will be critical for all airlines to reduce their direct emissions and we’re seeing more governments taking steps to encourage and enable growth in SAF supply and demand,"" the statement said.

""Singapore is taking a transparent approach to increasing SAF use and enabling emissions reduction.”

In September this year, the Albanese government announced a $1.1 billion pledge to help boost the production of ""low carbon liquid fuels"", including at least $33.5 million dedicated to a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative.

""The first production of ‘drop-in’ cleaner fuels, which can be directly substituted for existing fuels and work in today’s engines, is estimated by 2029,"" a joint statement released by Treasurer Jim Chalmers and Energy Minister Chris Bowen said.

""Liquid fuels make up around half of Australia’s national energy use. Replacing those fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives would deliver a massive climate and economic opportunity.""",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/0ec7aa47c6cd1f0c04a684fe3ef71e31?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=1125&cropW=2000&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-11-18 23:56:11.470514

Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong’s flagship airline, is soaring toward a greener future. The airline’s commitment to sustainability spans far beyond just fuel-efficient aircraft. From modernising its fleet to incorporating sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), Cathay Pacific is taking bold steps to reduce its carbon footprint and revolutionise air travel in Asia and beyond. With a goal of achieving 100% SAF by 2030 and reducing in-flight waste, the airline is making significant strides in transforming aviation into a more eco-conscious industry. This innovative journey isn’t just about fleet modernisation; it’s about sustainability across every aspect of its operation.

Cathay Pacific’s Green Fleet: The Key to Sustainability

One of the primary pillars of Cathay Pacific’s sustainability plan is its modern fleet of fuel-efficient jets. The airline has begun replacing older aircraft with newer, more environmentally friendly models like the Airbus A350 and A321neo. These planes are significantly more fuel-efficient, reducing emissions and optimising operational costs. By 2027, Cathay Pacific will also replace its ageing Boeing 747 cargo planes with the Airbus A350F, which will further lower its environmental impact.

The airline’s shift to more advanced, energy-efficient aircraft is a critical step toward making air travel more sustainable in the long term. With reduced emissions, these aircraft offer a greener alternative to the traditional, less-efficient planes still in operation around the world.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: A Game Changer

Cathay Pacific is also a frontrunner in promoting the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), an eco-friendly alternative to traditional jet fuel. In collaboration with aircraft manufacturer Airbus, the airline has made significant investments to ensure its fleet can operate on SAF. By 2030, Cathay aims for 100% of its jet fuel to be derived from SAF, which has the potential to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of air travel.

Currently, some Cathay flights already use a mix of conventional jet fuel and SAF, which is sourced from renewable materials like used cooking oil. This fuel reduces carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional fossil-based aviation fuel. The airline’s partnership with Airbus also includes a joint investment agreement of up to US$70 million to help accelerate SAF production, not only in Asia but globally, paving the way for a more sustainable aviation industry.

Minimising Waste: Cathay’s Eco-Conscious Cabin

While planes and fuel take centre stage, sustainability for Cathay Pacific extends far beyond the cockpit. The airline is also focusing on reducing waste and minimising its environmental impact in the cabin. Cathay has made remarkable progress in reducing single-use plastics onboard. From 2019 to 2025, the airline has reduced the average number of plastic items per passenger from 7.7 to just 1.5. Moreover, 50% of the remaining plastic onboard is made from recycled materials, and the airline is actively looking for alternative eco-friendly materials to further reduce plastic waste.

One notable achievement is the switch to 100% recycled plastic for all water bottles served on flights departing from Hong Kong. This initiative alone has contributed to a dramatic reduction in the airline’s plastic consumption, setting a positive example for other airlines in the region.

Waste Reduction and Circular Economy: A New Approach to Food Waste

Cathay Pacific is also leading the way in sustainable food waste management. In Hong Kong, food waste from flights is no longer just discarded; it’s recycled into electricity. The airline has implemented a system that sorts food waste at its Cathay Dining Flight Kitchen, sending it to an organic resources recovery centre. The food waste undergoes anaerobic digestion, a process that generates electricity – enough to power approximately 8,000 households annually.

This innovative approach not only helps reduce landfill waste but also supports a greener, circular economy where waste is viewed as a resource rather than something to be discarded.

The Future: Greener Together

Cathay Pacific’s sustainability strategy is built on collaboration. In addition to working with Airbus on SAF production, the airline is also involved in a partnership with the Oneworld alliance and Breakthrough Energy Ventures to fund the development of next-generation sustainable aviation fuels. This collaboration aims to advance SAF technologies in the long term, ensuring that they are scalable, cost-competitive, and accessible across the entire aviation industry.

As part of its holistic approach to sustainability, Cathay also has ambitious targets for waste reduction in the cabin. By 2030, it plans to reduce the amount of waste generated per passenger to just 0.63 kg, a 30% reduction from 2019 levels.

What Travelers Can Do to Support Sustainability

While Cathay Pacific is taking significant steps to green its operations, there are simple ways travelers can support the airline’s sustainability efforts. First, passengers can choose flights that operate on sustainable fuels when possible. Many airlines, including Cathay, are transparent about their environmental efforts, so travelers can be more conscious when booking their flights.

Another way to help is by bringing reusable items onboard, such as water bottles and travel mugs. This reduces the demand for single-use plastics and contributes to Cathay’s goal of reducing plastic waste. Additionally, travelers can support eco-friendly tourism by choosing sustainable travel destinations and encouraging other airlines to follow Cathay Pacific’s lead in adopting sustainable practices.

Sustainability in Hong Kong’s Travel Industry

Hong Kong’s travel and tourism industry is gradually embracing sustainability, with airlines like Cathay Pacific taking the lead. For travelers, this represents a shift toward more eco-conscious holiday options. As travelers become more aware of the environmental impacts of air travel, they are increasingly seeking out airlines that demonstrate a commitment to sustainability.

Biofuel company Sky Renewables has partnered with eight central Queensland farmers to trial growing the crop as a feedstock for renewable energy.

Traditionally grown in Europe, Russia and the United States to produce sugar, beets were first grown in Victoria's Gippsland region in the late 1800s, but the industry collapsed after World War II.

Already working with the industry that came to replace it — sugar cane — the company's chief executive Simon Yim hopes beets will prove superior when it comes to fuel.

As the Queensland government holds its own hearings into sugar's bioenergy opportunity, the industry is hopeful the COP30 climate talks in Brazil will set clear targets to incentivise further investment.

Waste game

In the Burdekin region near Townsville in north Queensland, Mr Yim works with canegrowers to produce biomethane, a renewable natural gas.

""We are trying to persuade the growers to abandon burning the cane field before harvesting so that we can take the tops and trash and use it as a feedstock,"" he said.

But 600 kilometres to the south, around Emerald, where cotton and grains are the staple crops, eight growers have signed up to work with the company over the next two years.

Mr Yim said the beets would be trialled as a winter rotational crop, extracting the sugar juice to ethanol, an ingredient in biofuel.

He said the lack of infrastructure made beets unviable as a sugar crop when compared to the established cane industry, but as a water-efficient feedstock for the fledgling biofuel industry, it stacked up.

""Right now, what was considered waste just a few years ago [has] become valuable,"" he said.

Shahana McKenzie, the chief executive of industry representative body Bioenergy Australia, said there were positive signs that value was being recognised globally.

""There has been a very strong focus on decarbonisation of the electricity sector globally,"" she said.

""It's really good to see that now there is this focus moving towards low-carbon liquid fuels and renewable gases.""

Two years ago, global leaders agreed to transition away from oil, gas and coal at the COP28 climate talks in Dubai, but the deal was criticised for failing to set actionable targets.

Ms McKenzie said the most recent climate talks in Brazil had the opportunity to drive global market development by addressing the shortage of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

""It sends a signal out globally across the countries to say this is now an area of focus.""

Sustainable momentum

In September, the Australian government announced a $1.1 billion program to promote biofuel manufacturing and development, in a bid to provide decarbonised fuel options to hard-to-abate sectors like aviation.

Mr Yim said international interest in SAF production had accelerated since Europe set a minimum supply mandate, which requires fuel at EU airports to contain a minimum of 2 per cent SAF in 2025, increasing to 70 per cent by 2050.

""For example, Qantas has committed to 10 per cent SAF in their tanks starting in 2030.""

Ms McKenzie said regional and rural Australia was in a unique position to capitalise on the interest.

""What we have seen over the past 12 months is absolutely a strong focus from businesses out of the US as well as Europe looking at Australia and saying, hang on, there's a lot of feedstock there,"" she said.

""With that feedstock in the regions, we can be providing economic returns into regional Australia.

""If we're talking about the low-carbon fuels and renewable gas projects, we're talking about thousands of jobs, we're talking an additional 10 billion GDP.""

In Queensland, that opportunity is being explored through an inquiry into sugarcane bioenergy opportunities.

Hearings resume in Brisbane on November 19. Among those providing submissions is the peak industry body for the sugarcane milling sector, Australian Sugar Manufacturers.

""Sugar-derived biofuels [can] provide affordable biogas to regional manufacturers and replace coal to make steel production green with renewable pellets made from sugar by-products.

""This agenda will create thousands of new jobs in places like Bundaberg, Mackay, Townsville and Cairns, and will attract more manufacturing businesses to regional Queensland through access to affordable energy and secure the long-term viability of the sugar industry that already supports 20,000 jobs.""

However, this industry, like many others that rely on traditional petrochemical fuel stocks, is facing multiple challenges [Citation2]. These include increased global demand for energy, increasingly limited petrochemical feedstocks and the pressing need to reduce global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to limit climate change [Citation3].

The aviation industry is estimated to contribute approximately 2.4% of the global CO2 emissions, with this figure due to increase because of the increasing reliance on air transportation for commercial and personal travel [Citation4,Citation5]. Many stakeholders have supported the creation of targets to reduce CO2 emissions by the aviation industry. One of the key strategies to achieve this goal is the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs). Conventional aviation fuels are produced by refining liquid fossil fuel sources. Synthetic aviation fuels, such as those produced from methane (Gas-to-liquid GTL), can be made from fossil or biological sources. The ASTM International has approved a range of non-fossil-fuel-based jet fuel pathways with Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) being derived from non-fossil fuel sources, but also requiring a lifecycle reduction in carbon emissions, no deforestation and no competition for needed food production [Citation6]. Therefore, not all biologically-derived fuels (biofuels) will meet the criteria to be considered a SAF. Current SAFs include fuels derived from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) from biologically-sourced oils or fats, non-HEFA pathways derived from wastes, and those utilising low carbon power sources. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) states that SAFs have the highest potential to reduce aviation CO2 emissions, with a typical 80% reduction when compared with conventional fuels and alternative aviation fuels such as GTL [Citation4,Citation7].

The introduction of new fuels will impact many areas of aviation fuel systems including supply, storage, usage and certification. SAFs and synthetic fuels are derived from non-conventional feedstocks, utilise a variety of processing technologies and, as such, could differ substantially in terms of the types and proportions of hydrocarbons available to support the growth of fungi, yeasts and bacteria commonly found in fuel systems [Citation4,Citation8]. The microbiome of fuel is of importance not just to the aviation industry, but also to the wider fuel community, as microbial contamination can result in fuel spoilage, microbially-induced corrosion, equipment malfunction or failure, all of which represent significant threats to the safety and security of these systems [Citation9,Citation10]. Currently, eight different Synthetic Blending Components (SBCs) deriving from various renewable feedstocks have been approved for blending with conventional jet fuel to produce SAFs [Citation11]. In this study, we explore the impact of three different sustainable blends on the growth of microbial contaminants.

The use of new fuels could lead to an alteration in the composition of the microbiome in fuel, fuel-associated water and sessile biofilms, subsequently requiring an adjustment of monitoring and testing regimes for the microbial contamination in these systems. The aviation industry currently uses different methodologies to detect microbial contamination during aircraft maintenance operations, and it is important to ensure that these methods remain accurate and reliable. Current testing regimes include both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. Culture-based methods include IP385 [Citation12] that utilises growth on nutrient media [Citation13] and thixotropic gels [Citation14]. Culture-independent methods include the monitoring of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) produced by microorganisms [Citation15,Citation16] or detecting antigenic material using lateral flow devices [Citation17]. Each method has advantages and disadvantages and assesses the level of contamination using different metrics such as enzymatic reactions, antibody/antigen interactions or assessment of growth. As such, alterations in the microbiome composition due to the introduction of synthetic fuels and SAFs has the potential to influence the performance of the tests. Therefore, as a first step, understanding the impact of these fuels on microbial community composition is vital.

In this study, we explore the impact of conventional, synthetic fuels and SAFs on microbial community composition, using biomass measurements and culture-independent techniques. There is a small body of literature exploring the microbiome of conventional Jet A-1 aviation fuel [Citation10,Citation18–20] and biodiesels [Citation21,Citation22], but few exploring the impact of synthetic fuels. Ruiz et al. [Citation23] used metagenomics and culture-based methods to study the effect of different fuels and blends (conventional diesels and jet fuels, renewable jet fuel (camelina-derived, hydro processed HRJ-5) and renewable diesels (algal-derived, hydro processed F76 and catalytic hydrothermal conversion CHCD)) on bacterial communities derived from seawater although these systems tended to go anaerobic and are more representative of marine sediment. Lobato et al. [Citation24] studied how two fungal isolates grew when supplied with conventional jet fuel, farnesane or a blend. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, one of the first that examines the impact of a range of potential or commercially-available SAFs and synthetic aviation fuels on the growth of mixed microbial communities as assessed by deep sequencing approaches and biomass measurements. Further, it presents an analysis of the most dominant microbial contaminants across the tested fuels, discussing the effectiveness of current fuel microbiological tests.

Results

Biomass accumulation

The dry weight of samples after 4 weeks of growth is shown in . (The biomass after 2 weeks’ growth was too low to measure reliably and would have benefited from a greater volume being filtered). Microbial growth was evident in all microcosms containing fuel – there was no growth in the controls containing BH medium without fuel. There was no significant difference (Kruskal-Wallis test, df = 15, p = 0.672) in total biomass between fuel types or the two starting communities.

A. Dry weight of biomass after 4 week’s growth on different fuels inoculated with community 1 (C1) and 2 (C2). B. Bacterial (16S rRNA) and fungal (ITS) and gene copy numbers mL−1 of microcosms containing different fuels, inoculated with two communities and harvested after 2 or 4 weeks of growth. Results are the mean +/− standard error. Fuel types are indicated by different shapes (Conv – conventional fuel, SAF – Sustainable Aviation Fuel, Syn -Synthetic aviation fuel.

DNA was extracted from each microcosm after 2 and 4 weeks, and the amount of bacterial and fungal DNA quantified using q-PCR against 16S rRNA and ITS genes respectively (). Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were much more abundant (mean 5 x 107 copies mL−1) compared to eukaryotic ITS genes (mean 41 copies mL−1). For eukaryotic ITS genes, there was no significant difference between fuel types, or week of harvest, but community 2 samples contained a mean of 81 ITS copies mL−1 compared to 22 ITS copies mL−1 in community 1 (p < 0.001). In contrast, there was no difference in 16S copies mL−1 between communities (p = 0.17), a small difference between week 2 and week 4 (p = 0.029) and differences between fuels (p = 0.0028). Post-hoc analysis showed that 16S rRNA copies mL−1 were lower in microcosms containing Farnesane and Gevo blend than the other fuels. These data were not corrected for potential differences in rRNA or ITS copy number in the target organisms as uncertainties in the true copy numbers expected in diverse microbial populations do not improve the reliability of metataxonomic surveys [Citation39]. These differences are likely to be more marked in fungal communities [Citation40] but the overall fungal abundance was very low in these samples.

High-throughput sequencing of microbial communities

High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and ITS amplicons was used to investigate the impact of different fuel types on microbial community composition. For the bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons, high quality sequence data was obtained for the majority of samples. However, for the ITS amplicons, very few sequences were obtained for community 1, reflecting the low biomass of eukaryotic microbes in these samples, and some samples contained few amplifiable ITS sequences for community 2. Therefore, results are presented for all bacterial samples, but only a limited number of Community 2 for fungal samples.

Community composition and Principal Components Analysis are shown in . Generalised linear models were used to identify statistically significant differences between bacteria.

Relative abundance of (A) bacterial ASVs at the Family and (B) fungal ASVs at the Genus level. Replicates have been merged and ASVs whose relative abundance was less than 2% have been grouped as ‘Other’. Taxa ending in ‘sp’ could not be classified at the level indicated – the lowest taxonomic group that could be assigned is shown. Principal components analysis of samples based on (C) 16S rRNA sequences and the weighted Unifrac distance measures and (D) ITS sequences based on weighted Bray distance measures. Each point is an individual replicate. Fuel types are indicated by different shapes (Conv – conventional fuel, SAF – Sustainable Aviation Fuel, Synthetic aviation fuel. The % variance explained by each component is indicated on the axes.

The initial inocula of both communities were dominated by bacteria in the Family Pseudomonadaceae, with contributions from Comamonadaceae, Xanthomonadaceae and Aquaspirillaceae in community 1 and Enterobacteriaceae in community 2. The fungal inoculum in community 2 was composed mainly of the Genera Amorphotheca resinae and Cadophora melinii. The number of sequences obtained from fungal communities was low for many samples, hence a comprehensive analysis of the impact of different fuel types on fungal growth was not possible, but in most samples, A. resinae and C. melinii remained dominant with additional contributions from Hawksworthiomyces taylorii.

When incubated with different fuel types, the complexity of the bacterial communities tended to fall after 2 week’s incubation, with Pseudomonadaceae dominant, and then recover (Supplementary Figure 2). With community 1, microcosms containing Farnesane and Gevo behaved differently from the rest of the fuels, with a greater relative abundance of Comamonadaceae present at both week 2 and 4 and a corresponding decrease in the relative abundance of the Pseudomonadaceae. In community 2, microcosms containing Farnesane and Gevo showed an increase in the relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae (although this was not statistically significant as there was variation in the responses of the replicate microcosms) with a reduction in the relative abundance of Pseudomonadaceae. The other major ASVs showed little, or no, significant changes between fuel types or were of low relative abundance.

Microcosms containing these fuels were separate from the conventional fuels in the Principal Components Analysis (See Supplementary Table 1 for statistical analysis). In community 2, microcosms containing Farenesane and Gevo also differed from the other fuels, although members of the Enterobacteriaceae increased in relative abundance. These patterns were still evident at week 4 although members of the Aquaspirilliaceae and Burkholderiaceae increased in relative abundance. For fungal communities, most samples were dominated by Amorphotheca, Aspergillus and Cadophora spp.

Community members common to different fuel types

Detection of microbial contamination of fuels based on the identification of specific ASVs will be influenced by the relative abundance of core community members. Given the low abundance of fungal ASVs in these samples, analysis is focussed on detection of bacterial ASVs. The ‘observed’ index indicates the number of ASVs found in each sample (note: dada2 processing removes singletons so rare ASVs will not be counted). The ‘coverage’ metric calculates the number of different ASVs that would need to be detected to sample a given proportion of the population (, ). The starting inocula had observed values for C1 of 80.0 +/− 3.2 and C2 of 31.7 +/− 4.65. After 2- or 4-weeks’ growth in microcosms, these values fell to mean values of 46.5 +/− 2.1 and 19.7 +/− 1.9, respectively (averaged across both sampling times and all fuels). Using a detection limit of 90%, the coverage metric for the C1 inoculum was 22.5 +/− 0.6 ASVs and for the C2 inoculum, 4.7 +/− 0.3 ASVs. The dominance of Pseudomonads in these samples was evident as these values fell to 2 and 1 ASVs respectively when a 50% coverage rate was considered.

After incubation for 2 weeks, the coverage values of microcosms inoculated with community 1 fell markedly, then increased after 4 weeks (except in Farnesane and Gevo, where it further decreased). The lower diversity of C2 resulted in much lower coverage values at both time points.

The 10 most abundant ASVs, based on their mean relative abundance across all samples, were used to determine the proportion of bacterial ASVs that would be detected in each sample (). In these communities, which were dominated by Pseudomonas spp., ASV1 had a mean relative abundance of 59.3% across both time points, communities and all fuels, and a minimum relative abundance of 17.7% in any individual sample.

Cumulative relative abundance of the top 10 most abundant ASVs, ranked for all fuels. For microcosms, open shapes are week 2, filled shapes week 4. Values are the mean with the standard error shown in grey; Pseudomonadaceae: Pseudomonas sp. (ASV1, ASV2, ASV13, ASV11); Comamonadaceae: Acidovorax sp. (ASV7, ASV14); Xanthomonadaceae: Xanthomonas SN8 (ASV6); Aquaspirillaceae: Microvirgula aerodenitrificans (ASV5); Enterobacteriaceae: Kosakonia sp (ASV3); Burkholderiaceae: Cupriavidus sp (ASV8).

The greater diversity in C1 compared to C2 was evident in the cumulative abundance curves. In C2, the curves showed sharp inflection points with most fuels indicating the dominance of the Pseudomonads ASV1 and ASV2. Exceptions were Jet A-1 Merox, Farnesane and Gevo, where other ASVs made significant contributions to the overall community. With C1, sharp inflections tended to be seen at Week 2 but were less evident at week 4, indicating an initial dominance in ASVs 1 and 2, then other community members becoming established. Again, microcosms containing Jet A-1 Merox, Farnesane and Gevo tended to show a more even community membership than the other fuels tested.

The ‘core’ microbiome refers to microbes common to a set of samples, but its calculation depends on the thresholds used to determine presence and the phylogenetic relationship between community members. The latter is particularly dependent on the method used to identify community members - an Amplified Sequence Variant (ASV) is an exact, error-corrected sequence hence ASVs may differ by a single nucleotide, whereas Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) are grouped on the basis of sequence similarity (typically 97%) [Citation41]. As small sequence variations are unlikely to influence microbial detection strategies, the core microbiome was calculated at the Genus level. Supplementary Figure 3 shows the relative abundance of dominant community members present at a relative abundance greater 1%. As the communities were dominated by Pseudomonads, this was the only core Genus identified in all samples and both communities. Other Genera were present in one or more fuel types.

Discussion

The move towards synthetic fuels and SAFs has been identified by many fuel producers as important for the future of the aviation industry. In this study we examine the impact of such fuels on the growth of microbial communities. Alterations in microbial community composition in response to changes in fuel composition may influence fuel system design, operation and contaminant monitoring to ensure effective microbial control. Previous studies exploring the microbiome of fuels have typically focused on those found in conventional fuels such as commercial Jet A-1 and military JP-8, diesels and biodiesels [Citation10,Citation18, Citation20,Citation21,Citation42,Citation43]. A metagenomics study [Citation23], looked at the effect of conventional (Jet-A, JP-5, JP-8, F-76) and sustainable (hydro-processed renewable jet and diesel and hydrothermal conversion diesel) fuels on seawater bacterial communities, indicating increased growth of Proteobacteria in all studied fuels but also some taxa being more abundant in certain fuel types. Another recent study [Citation24], compared the growth of two fungi in jet fuel, farnesane, and in 10% farnesane blend in jet, concluding no inhibition or promotion of fungal growth by farnesane. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to compare the impact of sustainable, synthetic and conventional aviation fuels on mixed, fuel-derived microbial communities, applying both biomass measurements and a culture-independent approach.

Dry biomass is a useful metric for the analysis of microbial growth under different culture conditions [Citation44,Citation45]. Whilst dry biomass was too low to determine accurately 2 weeks after inoculation, by four weeks, measurable biomass accumulated in all microcosms, with no significant difference between fuel types or starting inocula. qRTPCR analysis showed the communities were dominated by bacteria with a relatively low abundance of fungi. This reflected the composition of the two inocula used. The relative abundances of bacteria and fungi can differ markedly between sample originating from different locations. For example, Gaylarde et al. [Citation46] report that cultivatable bacterial cells typically exceed fungal cell numbers by ∼100-fold whereas [Citation43] report similar numbers of bacterial and fungal colony forming units (CFUs) in 3 out of 4 contaminated fuel samples (with no fungal growth detected in the fourth sample). Using culture-independent qRTPCR, Krohn et al. [Citation22] found very variable bacterial:fungal ratios in an analysis of 1,258 samples; bacteria dominated fuel samples, fungi tended to be more prevalent in biofilm samples and a highly variable ratio found in water samples (bacteria were always numerically dominant, but fungi varied from almost zero to near equivalence). The communities in the current study were numerically dominated by bacteria, but fungi were present and included those typical of contaminated fuel. Microbial communities will depend on composition of the starting inocula. Such ‘founder effects’ are commonly seen in microcosm studies, but are equally applicable to constructed environments, where microbial populations develop from an initial source of contamination (whether external input or residual biomass that persists in the tank after cleaning). There was a small effect of fuel type, but it is evident that microbial growth occurred in microcosms with all fuels tested (conventional, synthetic and SAF), and therefore operational risks are likely to continue regardless of the fuel type. However, given the diversity of microbial communities found in surveys, different fuel types may more markedly influence microbial communities that have different compositions.

Here, two different starting communities, derived from contaminated field samples, that were maintained as complex communities, were used to inoculate microcosms where the sole carbon source was provided by eight different fuels. High-throughput DNA sequencing analysis showed that the samples contained a range of taxonomic groups (15 bacterial Families, 14 fungal Genera at relative abundances greater than 1%) but that the evenness of the starting inocula were low, with the bacterial communities dominated by Pseudomonads. The number of observed bacterial ASVs declined in most microcosm samples, but the evenness (‘Simpson’ index) increased indicating that a wider range of bacterial ASVs had become numerically important in the microcosms. This is likely to have resulted from an initial ‘bottle’ effect, often seen when communities are grown in confined environments [Citation47] with later increases resulting from the establishment of slower growing organisms and cross-feeding by primary degraders of other community members [Citation29]. The fungal component of the inoculum was dominated by Amorphotheca resinae (previously known as Hormoconis resinae and Cladosporium resinae) and Cadophora sp – both of which are common fuel contaminants. These persisted in the microcosms along with a Hawksworthiomyces taylorii. The latter is not a reported fuel degrader, but is a known wood degrader [Citation48], many of which are found as fuel contaminants with capability to degrade aromatic ring structures.

Previous research has demonstrated that differences in fuel type may play a role in the community composition. For example, a study by Brown et al. [Citation42] found that the bacterial communities in Jet A-1 and JP8 samples differed, although multiple reasons may have accounted for these differences including the routine use of fuel system icing inhibitor (FSII) in military JP-8 fuel and that the Jet A-1 fuel samples came from aircraft in long-term storage in hot desert conditions. Therefore, the differences observed could not be attributed to fuel type but, as with all dynamic systems, other factors may be involved such as environmental conditions, additive packages and geographical location. Exploring the impact of different environmental factors in combination with synthetic and SAFs is an area that requires further exploration.

The composition of jet fuel is defined by specific criteria based on operational capability rather than chemical composition [Citation49]. The fuels in this study had very different compositions ranging from complex mixtures of paraffins, iso-paraffins, cyclo-paraffins, olefins and aromatics found in conventional fuels, through simpler synthetic fuels such as GTL which lack aromatics, and SBCs/SAFs such as Farnesane or alcohol-to-jet (Gevo), composed of one or two main molecular species (see Supplementary Figure 1). Therefore, microbial community composition may be influenced by degradation capabilities. However, the enzymatic systems employed by microorganisms can often degrade a range of similar moieties. For example, alkanes of different chain lengths can be degraded via oxidation to fatty acids that then enter the β-oxidation pathway, with each round reducing the alkyl chain length by 2 carbon groups [Citation50–52]. Also, different isolates of the same species may show different preferences or capabilities for fuel components. For example, different isolates of C. resinae shows different abilities to grow on n-alkanes in the range C9 to C18 [Citation53,Citation54]. Striebich et al. [Citation55] showed that Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and Yarrowia preferred C10-C22 n-alkanes, whereas Marinobacter preferred lighter or branched chain alkanes. These preferences may influence the precise microbial composition, but generalist degraders are likely to be favoured over specialists. Additionally, current SAF fuels are typically blended with conventional fuels in proportions no greater than 50%, thus it may be that the overall fuel composition is not altered sufficiently to cause significant shifts in the bacterial communities when compared to conventional aviation fuels. While aviation fuels composed of up to 100% SAF have been trialled successfully, 100% drop-in blends are not yet allowed based on ASTM International, who set global standards for aviation fuels [Citation49]. As such it will be important to continue monitoring potential shifts in the microbiome that may be caused by various feedstocks, production processes, and varying blending ratios. Although beyond the scope of this project, alterations in fuel composition may require the use of additives such as lubricity improvers, which may act as carbon sources, or metal atom deactivators which can include heteroatoms such as N. These may also influence microbial growth and community composition.

The detection of microbial contamination in fuel systems needs to target the dominant community members, as small community differences are generally not a concern. In some studies e.g. Krohn et al. [Citation22] diverse microorganisms have been identified in both floating and sessile phases, including those that are slow or difficult to grow in culture. Therefore, the detection of key indicator species is an efficient way to determine contamination in fuel systems providing these are representative of the diversity found in field samples and different operational conditions. Here, Pseudomonadaceae, a Family that contains species such Pseudomonas, Moraxella, and Acinetobacter, were dominant in both starting inocula. These organisms are frequently found in fuel systems and have been linked to operational problems [Citation56]. The dominance of Pseudomonadaceae has been noted in previous fuel studies with [Citation57] examining 54 fuel and fuel-associated water samples, noting high levels of abundance of Pseudomonas spp. in 21% of the cultured isolates. In other studies, however, different groups became dominant including Marinobacter, Burkholderia and Halomonas [Citation10]. Unlike our results, a large diversity of genera has been found in field samples from aircraft tanks and previously less studied genera such as Methylobacterium sp. were identified by transcriptome analysis as the most active in sessile biofilm swabs [Citation22].

Analysis of the relative proportions of the most abundant bacterial ASVs (across all fuels) () showed that detection of these would identify the majority of microbes in the different microcosms, although the cumulative abundance curves were less steep for Jet A-1 Merox, Farnesane and Gevo fuels reflecting the greater diversity in these samples. Analysis of fungal ASVs was limited by their low abundance in these studies, but inspection of the fungal community C2 showed that Hormoconis resinae was present in all samples, suggesting that it is as a good ‘indicator’ species for the detection of fungal contamination in SAFs as it is in conventional Jet A-1 [Citation46]. Other eukaryotes were detected with these often associated with fuel contamination or as environmental organisms associated with wood degradation. Other studies have observed uncultured and unknown organisms [Citation22] and a greater diversity of organisms are likely to be identified in future through high-throughput DNA sequencing [Citation19].

Comparisons () showed that, numerically, microbial composition was affected by fuel type. After 2 week’s growth, there was little difference between fuel types, except for Jet A-1 Merox, where the relative abundance of the Pseudomonadaceae and, to a lesser extent, Aquaspirillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, differed. After 4 week’s growth, there were small differences in community composition between fuel types in microcosms inoculated with C1, but with C2 the relative abundances of Pseudomonadaceae often differed, particularly in Farnesane, Gevo and Camelina fuels.

While within this study it was more difficult to compare the profiles of the different fungal communities, it appears that the profiles were all relatively similar to those in conventional aviation fuels. In samples collected from aircraft fuel tanks [Citation22], fuel and water samples were always dominated by bacteria whereas biofilms sometimes dominated by fungi. Therefore, current testing regimes should be able to assess fungal material in planktonic phases, but caution is required when considering biofilms.",https://covers.tandf.co.uk/og/TBFU.png,N,,2025-11-18 23:56:17.067291

In the letter, the companies warn that new delays will increase market uncertainty, and unfairly punish companies who have already made investments to comply with the new requirements, while rewarding laggards.

The letter follows several weeks of speculation over the timeline for the implementation of the EUDR, starting with a proposal by EU Commissioner Jessika Roswall in September to delay the regulation for a year due to concerns that IT systems currently in place will not be sufficient to handle the data load created by the new rules.

In October, the Commission said that it still plans to have the EUDR enter into force at the end of this year, but introduced a 6-month enforcement grace period for enforcement for large companies, and said that small enterprises will not be covered by the regulation until the end of 2026. The Commission also introduced a series of changes to simplify the regulation, including shifting reporting obligations to focus on the operators that actually place the relevant EUDR products on the market, while downstream operators such as retailers or manufacturers would no longer be obliged to submit due diligence statements, requiring only one submission, instead of multiple ones, in the EUDR IT system across the supply chain.

Despite the Commission’s proposed simplification’s however, some EU member states are still pushing for a one-year delay, and calling for a “stop-the-clock” mechanism to allow an opportunity for lawmakers to re-examine the regulation, as well as for a new review clause which could open up the regulation to further simplification in the future. The EU Parliament is expected to vote on its position on the Commission’s proposals next week.

The new letter follows an initial letter from many of the same companies in early October against the initial proposed delay. In the new letter, the companies state:

“Any proposal for a ‘stop-the-clock’ mechanism or a simplification review clause, leading to a suspension of the EUDR without clarity on its final provisions, would be extending current legal and market uncertainty for the long run. This approach would inflict substantial sunk costs on companies which have made the necessary investments and on-the-ground engagement in preparation for the EUDR, and reward the laggards.”

The companies added that the potential moves “would fatally compromise the EU’s reputation as a reliable partner of producing countries in halting deforestation.”

While welcoming the Commission’s 6-month enforcement grace period, the companies also warned that some of its proposals would not achieve its simplification objective, but could instead result in new complexities for downstream operators such as retailers or manufacturers. The companies instead proposed a “streamlined system” for the EUDR, in which due diligence statements would be submitted only by companies first placing relevant products on the EU market, all companies would be required to establish a due diligence system and to react to any evidence of non-compliance, or substantiated concerns, about products in their supply chains, and to keep records of the companies they buy from and sell to.

The companies said:

“This system would preserve the principles of due diligence and traceability that are essential to meet the aims of the EUDR while reducing the number of due diligence statements needing to be filed and avoiding placing excessive burdens on companies.”

The EUDR was initially introduced by the EU Commission in November 2021, with proposals aimed at effectively banning deforestation-linked products on the EU market, and establishing strong compliance requirements for companies providing or utilizing key commodities and products such as palm oil, beef, timber, coffee, cocoa, rubber and soy, in addition to some of their derived products, such as leather, chocolate, tires, or furniture. The regulation was initially set to become applicable from the end of December 2024, but was already delayed by a year to give companies more time to prepare for its compliance obligations.

The company said it continues to advance its proposed 6,500 barrel per day SAF project.","Tidewater Renewables Inc. on Nov. 13 released third quarter results, reporting production at its renewable diesel and renewable hydrogen (HDRD) complex in British Columbia was impacted in September and October by unplanned downtime. The facility is expected to be operating at full capacity by December. Plans are also progressing on a project to add sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) capacity.

During the third quarter of 2025, the HDRD complex produced 2,011 barrels per day, or 67% of design capacity, down from 2,849 barrels per day or 95% of design capacity during the same period of last year.

During an earnings call, Tidewater CEO Jeremy Baines explained that output during July and August averaged 2,920 barrels per day, or 97% of design capacity. The facility was scheduled to complete a three-week turnaround in September. The planned shutdown was extended by two additional weeks due to higher-than-anticipated bowing in the hydrodeoxygenation reactor beds, Baines explained.

Following the planned turnaround, the HDRD complex was also subject to a two-week unplanned outage in October. Baines attributed the unplanned downtime to an equipment anomaly that was temporarily repaired to resume operations. He said throughput has averaged approximately 2,330 barrels per day to-date in November, with production expected to return to full capacity in December after the affected component in reinstalled. A seven-day outage is expected to take place in December to complete installation of that component.

Bains also noted that the company has optimized the turnaround schedule to extend the catalyst life to approximately two and a half years. As a result, the next planned turnaround at the HDRD complex is scheduled for spring 2028.

For the full year, Tidewater expects the HDRD complex to achieve an average throughput of 1,900 to 2,000 barrels per day.

In its third quarter earnings release, Tidewater also provided a brief update on its plans to develop SAF capacity. The company said it continues to advance its proposed 6,500 barrel per day SAF project. Front-end engineering work was completed during the second quarter of 2025.

In September, Tidewater executed an amendment to its existing initiative agreement with the Government of British Columbia, providing for additional BC LCFS Credits. These additional credits are intended to help fund ongoing optimization work as the company works toward a potential final investment decision, currently targeted for 2026. Tidewater said it expects to receive emission credits, in connection with completing the first of three milestones outlined in the amended initiative agreement, in the fourth quarter of 2025, with the remaining credits expected to be received in the first half of 2026.

While Tidewater Renewables remains optimistic about the project’s potential, the company cautioned that the decision to proceed with the SAF project is contingent upon the execution of long-term offtake agreements, and provincial and federal government support to facilitate obtaining committed financing.

Tidewater reported a net loss of $1 million for the third quarter, compared to a net loss of $367.1 million reported for the same period of last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $16.5 million, up 21% when compared to the third quarter of 2024.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/biomassmagazine/posts/web/2022/09/TidewaterLogo_1664229504821.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 21:56:23.990740

For businesses across aviation, freight, agriculture, resources and energy, the consultation period provides an opportunity to contribute to the regulatory and commercial framework that will support the LCLF industry over the coming decade.

Demand policies include fuel or emissions reduction mandates, fuel levies (such as in Singapore) and low carbon fuel standards. Supply policies include research and development (grant) funding, production incentives and contract for difference (CfD) schemes.

Building on its recent announcement of a record $1.1 billion investment in the LCLF industry, the Australian Government has released a Policy Design and Engagement Paper for its Cleaner Fuels Program. The Australian Government is seeking submissions from industry on the architecture of the Program, which aims to stimulate the supply of LCLFs by providing production-linked incentives over ten years and target support towards LCLF projects that are advanced in development.

Written submissions are due on 19 December 2025 with the Program to be launched and applications open in mid-2026. For businesses across aviation, freight, agriculture, resources and energy, the consultation period provides an opportunity to contribute to the regulatory and commercial framework that will support the LCLF industry over the coming decade.

Drawing on our experience, we have identified five key themes in the Paper for consideration by prospective applicants, investors and offtakers.

1. Defining “eligible fuels”: fuel-agnostic v strategic prioritisation

The Paper considers two broad approaches. The first would treat sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable diesel (RD) and other emerging biofuels on an equal footing, with market forces determining which pathways succeed. The second would prioritise fuels essential for hard-to-abate sectors – notably aviation – or de-prioritise those with clearer electrification alternatives.

From a legal standpoint, certainty around eligibility is critical. Applicants need confidence that their chosen pathway will not later be excluded or disadvantaged. Applicants should provide evidence of demand, emissions abatement, and economic impacts for their preferred fuel type. Where relevant, submissions may reference Australia’s broader commitments, such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s net-zero 2050 target, to demonstrate alignment with national objectives.

2. Structuring production support: fixed credits or contracts-for-difference?

The Program intends to use a competitive process to ensure value is delivered with the total available funding and enable benchmarking of the amount of funding needed to enable a facility to progress to production. The Program prefers production-linked incentives to upfront grant payments, reducing the risk to taxpayers where producers receive payment without delivering product. Two competing concepts have been presented:

A fixed production credit (c $/L) determined competitively, payable per litre produced. This could be similar to the current fuel excise rebate available to fossil fuel users; or

A CfD scheme where Government tops up the gap between an competitively determined “strike price” and a reference LCLF market price, with symmetrical claw-back if prices rise. A CfD scheme could benefit less advanced LCLF projects or nascent technologies to bridge the higher cost of production to the SAF market price (after the introduction of a production credit), and to enable such other technologies to mature and become more cost effective, thereby diversifying Australia’s production of SAFs.

3. Carbon intensity thresholds and sustainability safeguards

There is a general expectation that only fuels achieving a specified lifecycle emissions reduction threshold compared with fossil equivalents will qualify for the Program, aligning Australia with EU and US thresholds. Whilst the Paper calls for consultation on the implementation of a threshold, having regard to previous consultation it could be in the vicinity of 50%, which may exclude certain domestic feedstocks, such as canola, in the short term.

Beyond carbon, the Paper canvasses broader sustainability criteria – land-use change, biodiversity, water, food security and labour standards – and alignment with certification schemes under the evolving Guarantee of Origin (GO) scheme which will include LCLFs from 2026. Early engagement with certifiers and the development of robust traceability systems will be important. Applicants and those involved in the supply chain may wish to separately review their supply contracts to ensure that sustainability obligations and data-sharing rights required for GO reporting are addressed.

4. Community benefits

The development of a LCLFs industry presents many economic opportunities to Australian communities, including by securing sovereign fuel supply resulting in lower fuel costs, and creating jobs in rural and regional areas where crops such as sugar cane and canola (used in the hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) SAF production method) are plentiful.

The Paper asks whether production supported by the Program should be restricted to domestic use. For projects seeking economies of scale through regional exports, including to SAF markets in Asia, this is a relevant consideration. Evidence that export flexibility could enhance domestic supply security may be persuasive.

Additionally, as the Cleaner Fuels Program is administered under the Future Made in Australia Act 2024 (Cth), applicants must demonstrate compliance with six community benefit principles, including promoting safe and secure jobs, supporting First Nations participation, and demonstrating transparency and compliance in relation to the management of tax affairs. In practice, this means proponents could provide social procurement plans, local workforce strategies, and mechanisms for First Nations equity or benefit-sharing.

5. A complex policy intersection

The Program will not operate in isolation. Prospective applicants should map interactions with:

The Safeguard Mechanism, the Australian Government's policy for reducing emissions at large industrial facilities;

The New Vehicle Efficiency Standard, influencing demand for renewable diesel in heavy transport;

State planning and environmental regulations; and

Finance pathways via the National Reconstruction Fund, CEFC or Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility.

Each layer involves its own compliance obligations, information requirements and reporting timelines. Coordinated legal advice across environmental, trade, tax, and project finance can assist in managing these requirements efficiently.

Looking ahead – aligning policy ambition with market reality

Australia’s resource endowment – from abundant biomass residues to renewable electricity for e-fuels – positions it well to capture a share of the burgeoning global sustainable fuels market. Projects that are ready to move to final investment decision will likely benefit most from the Program.

For Government, the policy challenge is to design a scheme that supports projects without creating ongoing subsidy dependence or favouring established technologies over innovation. Transparent, bankable, and adaptable incentives will be important. Alignment with international sustainability standards may assist Australian fuel in accessing premium markets overseas, while community benefit obligations can support social licence domestically.

For industry, early engagement, collaboration, and preparation to demonstrate technological capability, carbon integrity, community value, and financial discipline will be key to success in the Program and future commercial benefit from participating in the LCLF industry. The upcoming consultation period provides applicants with a critical opportunity to contribute to the development of the sector’s regulatory framework.",https://www.claytonutz.com/cfimages/CU-Insights.webp/public,N,,2025-11-18 21:56:29.638685

Opening Summary

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the aviation industry currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, with projections showing air travel demand could double by 2040. In my work with major airlines and aerospace manufacturers, I’ve witnessed firsthand the immense pressure this creates. The industry stands at a critical inflection point where sustainability isn’t just an environmental concern—it’s becoming the primary driver of innovation and competitive advantage. As a technology futurist who has advised Fortune 500 companies on digital transformation, I see Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) emerging as the cornerstone of aviation’s future. The current landscape reveals an industry grappling with legacy infrastructure while racing toward a cleaner, more efficient future. What fascinates me most is how quickly this transformation is accelerating—we’re not talking about distant possibilities but immediate business imperatives that will reshape global aviation within this decade.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The SAF Production and Scalability Dilemma

The most pressing challenge I consistently encounter in my consulting work is the massive gap between SAF demand and production capacity. According to McKinsey & Company analysis, SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of global jet fuel consumption, despite growing commitments from airlines and corporate travelers. The fundamental issue lies in scaling production to meet ambitious net-zero targets. I’ve seen airline executives struggle with this reality—they want to commit to SAF but face limited availability and premium pricing. As noted by the World Economic Forum, scaling SAF production requires overcoming significant technological and economic barriers, including high capital costs for production facilities and competition for sustainable feedstocks. The business impact is substantial: airlines risk missing sustainability targets, facing regulatory penalties, and losing environmentally conscious customers to competitors who secure scarce SAF supplies.

Challenge 2: Infrastructure and Supply Chain Transformation

The second major challenge involves overhauling century-old aviation infrastructure and supply chains. In my experience working with airport operators and fuel suppliers, I’ve observed how existing infrastructure was designed for conventional jet fuel, creating compatibility issues with new fuel types. Deloitte research highlights that adapting current refueling systems, storage facilities, and distribution networks for SAF requires massive capital investment and coordinated industry effort. The implications extend beyond airports to the entire value chain—from feedstock producers to fuel blenders and distributors. What many business leaders underestimate is the domino effect: a single change in fuel composition can impact aircraft performance, maintenance schedules, and operational procedures. This infrastructure challenge represents what I call a “systemic innovation barrier”—where progress in one area is hindered by limitations in interconnected systems.

Challenge 3: Economic Viability and Investment Uncertainty

The third challenge that keeps aviation executives awake at night is achieving economic viability while managing investment risks. Harvard Business Review analysis indicates that SAF currently costs 2-4 times more than conventional jet fuel, creating significant financial pressure on airlines already operating on thin margins. In my strategic foresight sessions with industry leaders, I’ve seen how this cost differential creates a classic chicken-and-egg scenario: without scale, costs remain high, but without cost reduction, scale remains elusive. PwC’s aviation outlook reinforces this concern, noting that the capital required to build sufficient SAF production capacity exceeds $1 trillion globally. The business impact is profound: airlines must balance sustainability commitments with financial performance, while investors weigh the risks of backing emerging SAF technologies against established energy investments.

Solutions and Innovations

The good news is that innovative solutions are emerging faster than many industry observers predicted. From my front-row seat watching technological evolution, I’m particularly excited about three breakthrough approaches that are gaining traction.

First, advanced biofuel pathways using novel feedstocks are demonstrating remarkable potential. Companies like LanzaJet are commercializing alcohol-to-jet technology that can use ethanol from various sources, including agricultural waste and non-food biomass. I’ve seen this technology in action during my research visits, and what impresses me is its flexibility—it can adapt to regional feedstock availability, making it scalable across different geographies.

Second, power-to-liquid (PtL) technologies represent what I believe will be the ultimate game-changer. According to recent Accenture analysis, synthetic fuels produced using renewable electricity, water, and captured CO2 could eventually supply up to 15% of global aviation fuel demand by 2050. Major players like Airbus are investing heavily in these technologies, recognizing their potential to decouple fuel production from biological constraints.

Third, digital fuel management platforms are creating unprecedented transparency and efficiency. In my consulting work, I’ve helped implement blockchain-based tracking systems that provide certified proof of sustainability from production to consumption. These platforms create value by enabling premium pricing for verified sustainable fuels while giving corporate customers the carbon accounting data they increasingly demand.

The most forward-thinking organizations are combining these solutions with strategic partnerships. United Airlines’ investment in multiple SAF startups exemplifies this approach—spreading risk while accelerating multiple technological pathways simultaneously.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Based on my analysis of technological trajectories and industry commitments, I project that SAF will account for at least 10% of global aviation fuel by 2035, with some regions potentially reaching 15-20%. Goldman Sachs Research estimates the SAF market could grow from approximately $500 million today to over $30 billion by 2030, representing one of the fastest-growing segments in clean energy.

My foresight exercises with industry leaders reveal several “what if” scenarios that could accelerate this transformation. What if major oil companies reallocate 20% of their conventional fuel investment to SAF production? What if carbon taxes make conventional jet fuel 50% more expensive within five years? What if corporate travel policies mandate 25% SAF usage for all business flights by 2028? Each of these scenarios points toward the same conclusion: the SAF transition will happen faster than current linear projections suggest.

I expect several technological breakthroughs within the next 3-5 years that will dramatically change the economics of SAF production. Advanced catalytic processes could reduce production costs by 40-60%, while synthetic biology approaches using engineered microorganisms could increase feedstock conversion efficiency beyond current limits. The International Energy Agency projects that supportive policies and technological learning could make SAF cost-competitive with conventional jet fuel by 2030 in favorable regulatory environments.

The industry transformation will follow a clear timeline: demonstration-scale plants becoming operational within 2-3 years, first commercial-scale facilities by 2026-2028, and widespread adoption through the 2030s. By 2035, I predict that SAF will no longer be a niche product but a standard component of aviation fuel blends worldwide.

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

Over the next decade, aviation will undergo its most significant transformation since the jet age. SAF will evolve from a sustainability initiative to a core business strategy, with leading airlines leveraging their SAF access as a competitive differentiator. The opportunities are massive: first-movers in SAF production and distribution will capture extraordinary value, while airlines that secure long-term SAF contracts will enjoy premium brand positioning and customer loyalty. The risks are equally significant: organizations that delay their SAF strategies face regulatory pressure, reputational damage, and potential exclusion from key markets with strict sustainability requirements. The fundamental shift I foresee is from viewing SAF as an environmental compliance cost to recognizing it as a strategic asset that drives business resilience and growth.

Ian Khan’s Closing

In my two decades of studying technological transformations, I’ve never witnessed an industry pivot as rapidly and decisively as aviation is doing with SAF. The future belongs to those who recognize that sustainability and profitability are not opposing forces but complementary objectives. As I often tell the leaders I work with: “The greatest risk isn’t in moving too fast toward the future—it’s in moving too slow.”

Opening Summary

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the aviation industry currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, with projections showing this could triple by 2050 without significant intervention. In my work advising global aviation leaders, I’ve witnessed firsthand the urgent pressure to decarbonize while maintaining growth. The current sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production stands at just 0.1% of total jet fuel demand, as reported by McKinsey & Company, creating both an enormous challenge and unprecedented opportunity. What fascinates me most is how this tiny fraction represents the seed of a complete industry transformation that will redefine air travel as we know it. We’re not just talking about incremental changes here – we’re witnessing the birth of an entirely new energy ecosystem that will reshape global supply chains, create new economic powerhouses, and fundamentally alter how we think about mobility. The race to scale SAF production is accelerating, and the decisions made today will determine which organizations lead tomorrow’s aviation landscape.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The Production Scale-Up Dilemma

The most immediate challenge I observe in my consulting work with aviation leaders is the massive gap between current SAF production capacity and projected demand. According to Deloitte research, global SAF production needs to increase by at least 1,000 times current levels to meet 2030 targets. What makes this particularly complex isn’t just building more facilities – it’s creating an entirely new industrial ecosystem. I’ve sat in boardrooms where executives grapple with the chicken-and-egg problem: airlines can’t commit to SAF without reliable supply, and producers can’t secure funding without airline commitments. The World Economic Forum notes that current SAF production costs remain 2-4 times higher than conventional jet fuel, creating significant economic headwinds. This isn’t merely a technical challenge; it’s a complete rethinking of energy infrastructure that requires unprecedented collaboration across traditionally separate industries.

Challenge 2: Feedstock Availability and Sustainability Certification

In my analysis of SAF supply chains, the feedstock question emerges as perhaps the most complex puzzle. As noted by Harvard Business Review, the competition for sustainable biomass between aviation, maritime, and other industries will intensify dramatically in the coming years. I’ve consulted with organizations struggling to navigate the intricate web of sustainability certifications, land use concerns, and competing environmental priorities. The challenge extends beyond simply finding enough raw materials – it’s about creating systems that are genuinely sustainable and verifiable. PwC research indicates that without careful management, the rush to secure feedstocks could create unintended environmental consequences or conflict with food production. What keeps aviation CEOs awake at night isn’t just finding feedstocks today, but ensuring they can scale sustainably while maintaining public trust and regulatory compliance.

Challenge 3: Infrastructure Integration and Global Standards

The third critical challenge I consistently encounter involves the physical and regulatory infrastructure required for SAF adoption. According to Accenture analysis, less than 5% of global airports currently have dedicated SAF blending and storage facilities. This creates a logistical nightmare for airlines trying to maintain consistent operations across their networks. In my strategic foresight work, I help organizations visualize the cascading effects of infrastructure gaps – from blending inconsistencies to transportation bottlenecks. The lack of global standards compounds these challenges, creating regulatory fragmentation that increases costs and complexity. Gartner research highlights that without standardized certification and accounting methods, the risk of greenwashing accusations remains high, potentially undermining the entire transition effort. This isn’t just about building new infrastructure; it’s about creating interoperable systems that work seamlessly across borders and organizations.

Solutions and Innovations

The good news is that innovative solutions are emerging faster than many predicted. In my research for “The Futurist” series, I’ve identified several breakthrough approaches that are gaining traction. First, advanced biofuels using novel feedstocks like agricultural waste, algae, and municipal solid waste are showing remarkable potential. Companies like LanzaJet are demonstrating that waste-to-fuel pathways can achieve up to 70% reduction in lifecycle emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

Second, power-to-liquid (PtL) technologies represent what I believe will be the ultimate game-changer. By combining captured CO2 with green hydrogen, these synthetic fuels can achieve near-carbon-neutral operations. The European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate specifically includes PtL targets, signaling strong regulatory support. I’ve advised several energy companies that are positioning themselves at this intersection of renewable energy and fuel production.

Third, digital tracking and certification platforms are addressing the transparency challenge. Blockchain-based systems, similar to those I’ve helped implement in other supply chain contexts, are enabling real-time tracking of sustainability attributes from production to consumption. This creates the audit trail needed for credible emissions accounting and helps prevent double-counting of environmental benefits.

Fourth, strategic partnerships between airlines, fuel producers, and technology companies are accelerating innovation. The collaboration between United Airlines, Honeywell, and Alder Fuels demonstrates how cross-industry alliances can de-risk development and scale production more rapidly. In my consulting practice, I’m seeing these partnerships become increasingly sophisticated, with shared investment models and risk-sharing arrangements that would have been unthinkable a decade ago.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Based on my analysis of current trajectories and technological breakthroughs, I project that SAF will account for at least 15-20% of global aviation fuel by 2035. According to BloombergNEF forecasts, the SAF market could grow from approximately $500 million in 2023 to over $30 billion by 2030. This represents one of the most rapid energy transitions in modern history.

What excites me most are the potential technological breakthroughs on the horizon. In my foresight exercises with industry leaders, we explore scenarios where synthetic biology enables cost-competitive SAF production from CO2 captured directly from the air. McKinsey analysis suggests that with sufficient investment and policy support, power-to-liquid fuels could achieve price parity with conventional jet fuel by the early 2030s.

The geographical distribution of production will also transform global energy flows. While current SAF production is concentrated in North America and Europe, I predict that Asia and the Middle East will emerge as major production hubs by the late 2020s. This shift will create new energy trade routes and potentially redistribute economic power within the aviation ecosystem.

Market size predictions vary, but Goldman Sachs Research estimates the total addressable market for SAF could reach $2 trillion by 2050. What’s particularly significant is how this growth will catalyze adjacent industries – from carbon capture technology to hydrogen production to advanced biotechnology. We’re not just watching a fuel transition; we’re witnessing the creation of an entirely new industrial cluster.

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

Over the next decade, sustainable aviation fuel will evolve from a niche product to a mainstream energy source that fundamentally reshapes aviation economics and operations. The organizations that thrive will be those that approach SAF not as a compliance requirement but as a strategic opportunity to build competitive advantage. We’ll see consolidation among producers, new alliances between energy and aviation companies, and the emergence of SAF as a traded commodity with its own market dynamics. The risks are significant – technological hurdles, policy uncertainty, and cost pressures could slow adoption. However, the opportunities for first-movers are enormous, from securing preferential supply arrangements to developing proprietary production technologies. The next ten years will determine which organizations lead aviation’s sustainable future.

Ian Khan’s Closing

The transition to sustainable aviation represents one of the most exciting industrial transformations of our lifetime. As I often tell leaders in my keynotes: “The future belongs to those who see opportunities where others see obstacles, and who build bridges where others see barriers.”

Ensure Changi Airport remains price competitive with green jet fuel levy

” (Nov 13).

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has set a long-term aspirational goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions for international aviation by 2050. Various ICAO members, including the European Union, Japan, South Korea and the UK, have mandated or plan to mandate the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to work towards this goal. Singapore is not the first or only country to do so, and we have chosen to do so in a pragmatic and balanced manner.

We have set the SAF levy for an economy ticket at between $1 and $10.40, and the equivalent levies for business- and first-class tickets at between $4 and $41.60. This endeavours to keep costs manageable and ensures that our air hub remains price competitive.

The SAF levy will apply for tickets and services sold from April 1, 2026, for flights departing from Singapore from Oct 1, 2026, with the SAF levy amounts remaining unchanged even if SAF prices were to rise later. We have consulted the industry and stakeholders, and do not expect the SAF levy to have a significant effect on air travel demand and the price competitiveness of Changi Airport.

The airlines agreed they will not claim that paying extra to fund climate protection projects or the use of alternative aviation fuels can directly neutralize or reduce emissions on an individual flight. In addition, the airlines committed to tighter substantiation, clearer disclosures, and more transparent CO₂ calculators, particularly as they relate to their use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). National consumer authorities will monitor implementation and may enforce against carriers that fall short.

Although the Commission’s action targets EU airlines, U.S. airlines should review their marketing in the EU accordingly. In addition, the EU's action provides important insight into how EU authorities view environmental marketing claims more generally. Companies in other sectors should review their environmental marketing claims in light of this action, particularly if they have programs that give consumers the option to pay extra fees to fund the use of alternative fuels or support projects that offset emissions.

Legal Framework & Enforcement Posture

The Commission’s announcement follows a coordinated review by the Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Network, a network of authorities responsible for enforcing EU consumer protection laws. The CPC Network can take action under the Consumer Protection Regulation to address cross-border issues at the EU level in coordination with the Commission.

In addition to announcing the commitments from the 21 airlines subject to the review, the Commission also published a table tracking each airline’s commitments and timelines; authorities will verify timely implementation and pursue enforcement, if needed. To ensure fair competition and a level playing field in the aviation industry, the Commission’s announcement states that the CPC Network will also assess the practices of other airlines operating in the Single Market, and, where necessary, require the same commitments.

The CPC's action stemmed from an alert filed by BEUC (representing consumer organizations across the EU) in June 2023, pursuant to the Consumer Protection Regulation, alleging that 17 European airlines misled consumers by claiming ""green fees"" would render their flights sustainable and, more broadly, by implying ""flying is sustainable."" The complaint alleged that these claims constitute infringements of Directive 2005/29/EC (the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive - UCPD).

The UCPD harmonizes national laws governing business-to-consumer practices in the internal market and prohibits unfair commercial practices (Article 5), misleading actions (Article 6), and misleading omissions (Article 7). The European Commission’s Guidance Notice on the interpretation and application of the UCPD, though not legally binding, is intended to clarify and facilitate its proper application, and includes guidance on which environmental claims may be considered misleading.

What the 21 Airlines Committed to Change

Clarify that a specific flight’s CO₂ emissions cannot be neutralized, offset, or directly reduced by optional passenger payments for climate projects or alternative fuels.

Use “sustainable aviation fuel” (SAF) terminology only with appropriate clarifications and substantiation.

Avoid vague “green” language or implicit environmental claims.

Provide more detail when stating future climate goals (e.g., net-zero): include timelines, achievable steps, and the types of emissions covered.

Display CO₂ calculations clearly and transparently.

Support claims with sufficient scientific evidence.

Why This Matters in Aviation and Beyond

Although this example targets airlines, it signals how EU enforcers expect environmental marketing to be framed across sectors:

Claims that payment of fees will render products/services “Carbon-Neutral” or “Sustainable” Require Rigorous Clarification and Substantiation. The CPC’s scrutiny of pay-to-offset schemes may serve as a warning to other industries that sell add-ons implying immediate neutrality.

SAF and similar “transition” claims need precise context. Claims about cleaner inputs (e.g., SAF) should avoid implying one-for-one emission reductions for a specific transaction and must be properly qualified.

Aspirational goals must be anchored in plans. Claims regarding net-zero or carbon-neutral goals should include timelines, milestones, scope clarity (Scopes 1–3), and methodologies.

CO₂ calculators may be perceived as marketing claims. If you publish route- or product-level emissions figures, expect scrutiny of assumptions, data sources, and presentation.

EU coordination is accelerating. This airline action follows earlier EU-level probes and national rulings that have tightened the bar on “sustainable flight” messaging.

Practical Next Steps For EU-facing Marketers

Inventory – and revise if appropriate – green claims and map each to evidence (testing or internationally recognized methodologies), consistent with UCPD guidance and the evolving landscape of green marketing law at the EU-level (e.g., the Empowering Consumers Directive and the pending Green Claims Directive) and member-state level.

Avoid using vague buzzwords (“eco-friendly,” “green,” “sustainable”) unless defined and substantiated, in alignment with EU law.

Train relevant internal teams (e.g., marketing, sustainability, and legal) on EU marketing laws, guidance, and prior decisions affecting green marketing claims and set up pre-clearance for sustainability messaging.

Continue to closely monitor the rapidly evolving legal and policy developments in green marketing, not just in the EU but in other jurisdictions as well. (see, e.g., Canada Issues Guidelines on Civil Greenwashing Claims One Year After Amendments to the Competition Act).

Summary



Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines are investing in the future of the communities we serve by partnering with Mountain Towns 2030 (MT2030).



Earlier this year, we became a major sponsor of the annual MT2030 Climate Summit to launch the MT2030 Elevate Scholarship, a program designed to remove financial barriers for community leaders eager to participate in the three-day event.

In the heart of America’s mountain towns — where alpine trails meet bluebird skies — communities are facing the growing challenges of climate change. These towns, often nestled in remote, high-altitude regions, are particularly vulnerable to environmental shifts and have become increasingly susceptible to droughts, wildfires, avalanches and ecological degradation.

Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines are investing in the future of the communities we serve by partnering with Mountain Towns 2030 (MT2030), a nonprofit that empowers a movement of mountain communities committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2030.

Earlier this year, we became a major sponsor of the annual MT2030 Climate Summit to launch the MT2030 Elevate Scholarship, a program designed to remove financial barriers for community leaders eager to participate in the three-day event. Four scholarship recipients from California and Washington were selected to attend the October gathering, hosted in Breckenridge, Colo., and flown on Alaska Airlines. The group joined hundreds of industry professionals and stakeholders in conversations around complex climate challenges and solutions.

We hosted more than 600 attendees from 61 mountain communities and 37 ski resorts, with 118 speakers leading 49 sessions across a wide range of climate and sustainability topics. Our 2025 Summit was an overwhelming success, and we couldn’t have done it without Alaska Airlines’ partnership.”

Mountain communities are on the front lines of climate change, and the Mountain Towns 2030 Climate Summit was a powerful reminder of how progress happens when we collaborate. It was inspiring to see communities sharing real-world solutions and building connections that will accelerate climate action. The peer-led sessions and the MT2030 Elevate Scholarship recipients brought fresh perspectives that will help ensure every community has a voice in shaping a more sustainable future.”

Following the MT2030 Climate Summit, we caught up with scholarship recipient Michelle to hear her reflections on the experience and what it meant to her.

What do you do for your work? What challenges does your community face that you were looking for insight on at the MT2030 Climate Summit?

I do government relations and environmental affairs for Mammoth Mountain and June Mountain. Like many other communities, wildfire is a major threat to our area, and I was interested in seeing what others were doing and how, as a ski area, we could contribute to our community.

What was the most eye-opening moment or takeaway from the Summit?

It was great to see such a large group of like-minded individuals sharing their experiences and common goals. I participated in a Solutions Lab session, which was a presentation followed by an interactive exchange to explore actionable strategies and insights. I really enjoyed the TED talk-style presentations. The Summit gave me some ideas on ways to further develop and grow our mountains’ sustainability program.

What role do you think travelers play in shaping the future of climate-resilient communities?

I think travelers play a big role in the future of climate-resilient communities. Their sustainable demands and preferences can drive the investment of our communities and resorts. An example would be electric vehicles — the increase in visitors driving EVs requires the installation of more charging stations. Travelers can also create new challenges in our communities by over-utilizing resources or not traveling responsibly. Being mindful of your impact while exploring is critical.

What’s something you learned at the summit that mountain adventure travelers should be aware of and that you’re excited to bring home?

That communities are stronger when businesses and local governments work together toward common sustainability goals. The partnership can create innovative ideas and a more climate-resilient plan for the future.

Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines are proud to connect our guests with legendary mountain communities and resorts, where adventure is a way of life. Before your next winter ski trip or summer expedition, consider these tips:

Many small choices make a big difference: Pack a lighter bag to help us burn less fuel, bring a reusable water bottle, and choose reef-safe sunscreen or SPF clothing to protect local water sources.

Join our EverGreen journey and earn elite-qualifying status points: Help us make air travel more sustainable by supporting our transition to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). By making a SAF contribution, you can support carbon reductions and earn status points.

Travel responsibly: We fly to some of the most beautiful places on Earth and want our kids, grandkids and generations to enjoy these incredible locales as well. Follow Leave No Trace principles to protect the landscapes you love. Reduce your emissions by using shuttles, buses or carpooling when possible.

Support local and sustainability-driven businesses: When you arrive, choose accommodations, restaurants and tour operators that prioritize sustainability and are locally owned.","https://news.alaskaair.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251007-Climate-Summit-KUS273.jpg?resize=1600,900",N,,2025-11-18 15:57:34.020125

LanzaJet’s plan to scale sustainable aviation fuel LanzaJet describes its work in Soperton as a ""first-of-its-kind"" integrated solution.","For years, US-based firm LanzaJet has been working to crack the code on the production of sustainable aviation fuel. After 15 years of research and development, the company has reached a hugely significant milestone in its journey.

The team confirmed that it has successfully produced its first round of jet fuel using ethanol at its Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Soperton, Georgia.

It sees LanzaJet take its alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) technology from the lab to a commercial setting for the first time.

The fuel produced in Georgia is fully compatible with existing aircraft technology, meaning it can be 'dropped in' as a direct replacement for carbon-heavy jet fuels. This could go a long way towards shrinking the carbon footprints of airlines.

What's more, LanzaJet's achievement is the very first time that a non-oil-based renewable solution of this nature has reached commercial production levels, with most SAFs generally being made using a kind of bio-oil.

How LanzaJet is overcoming feedstock challenges

Industry analysts have been warning that SAF made using Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) is approaching a plateau in terms of the levels of feedstock available. As such, LanzaJet's alcohol-based solution represents a sound alternative.

The firm's proprietary technology looks to bypass this bottleneck. The process LanzaJet uses harnesses some widely available ethanol feedstocks, including agricultural residues and municipal solid waste.

By shifting focus to ethanol, the technology has the potential to open pathways for waste sources and recycled carbon to contribute to the aviation energy mix.

Flyn van Ewijk, Regional Director for APAC at LanzaJet, says: ""Overnight we shared news that LanzaJet had made history: producing jet fuel from ethanol at the world's first commercial scale plant.

""This moment is not only hugely significant for the LanzaJet family – the culmination of 15 years of research and development, collaboration, investment and scale-up – but also for our industry as it marks the next wave of SAF technology to reach commercial readiness in nearly a decade.""

LanzaJet’s plan to scale sustainable aviation fuel

LanzaJet describes its work in Soperton as a ""first-of-its-kind"" integrated solution.

It incorporates Technip Energies’ Hummingbird Ethanol-to-Ethylene solution alongside oligomerisation technology jointly developed by LanzaTech and the US Department of Energy.

Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet, has taken pains to emphasise the role collaboration has played in the company's recent achievements.

“Today proves what happens when you bring together innovation, resilience, ingenuity, and teamwork to think big and develop a new industry, overcome challenges, and enable global growth,” he says.

“We’re now in a unique position with technology and operational know-how to shape this global industry in the decade ahead.”

Brian Mandell, EVP Marketing and Commercial at Phillips 66, said: “This agreement between Phillips 66 and DHL demonstrates our shared commitment to SAF market leadership and credible action in the growing SAF industry.
Through our global renewable fuel business, we are committed to supporting DHL and our customers in achieving their decarbonization goals.”","Logistics giant DHL Group announced a new agreement with U.S.-based energy products manufacturer Phillips 66 for the purchase of more than 240,000 metric tons (314 million liters) of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), to be delivered to U.S. airports over three years.

The deal marks one of the largest SAF agreements by a U.S. producer to date, and is anticipated to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by approximately 737,000 metric tons compared to conventional jet fuel, according to DHL.

Scaling the use of sustainable aviation and alternative fuels forms a significant part of DHL’s Sustainability Roadmap. Launched in 2021, the roadmap included plans to invest €7 billion over ten years in measures to reduce its CO2 emissions, with a focus on the expansion of a zero-emissions fleet, alternative aviation fuels, and climate-neutral buildings. In addition to its 2050 net zero goal, DHL also has interim targets to increase the share of more sustainable fuels across all transportation modes to more than 30%, and to electrify two-thirds of last-mile delivery vehicles by 2030.

In addition to supporting DHL’s sustainability goals, the new agreement is expected to contribute significantly to the company’s carbon “insetting” GoGreen Plus service, which enables customers to reduce their Scope 3 GHG emissions using SAF.

Travis Cobb, EVP Global Operations and Aviation at DHL Express, said:

“This agreement with Phillips 66 is a significant milestone for DHL Express as we work towards our sustainability goals. By securing a reliable supply of SAF, we are not only reducing our carbon emissions – and those within our customers’ supply chains – but also setting a precedent for the logistics and air cargo industries in the U.S.”

Under the new agreement, Phillips 66 will deliver SAF to DHL Express from the energy company’s Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex in California. Phillips 66 announced in 2022 that it planned to convert its oil refinery in Rodeo to process only renewable feedstocks, with the facility no longer processing crude oil and instead using waste oils, fats, greases and vegetable oils instead to produce 800 million gallons per year (over 50,000 barrels per day) of renewable transportation fuels, including renewable diesel, renewable gasoline and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). The company announced the completion of the conversion last year. The complex is now one of the largest renewable fuel facilities in the world, and has an SAF production capacity of 150 million gallons per year.

The SAF will be delivered primarily to Los Angeles International Airport, with future intended deliveries to other West Coast airports where DHL maintains operations.

Brian Mandell, EVP Marketing and Commercial at Phillips 66, said:

The transaction, announced today at the Dubai Airshow, includes nine A330neos and four A320neo family aircraft.

Etihad has today also placed a direct order with Airbus for six additional A330neos, complementing the nine aircraft leased from Avolon and bringing its total A330neo fleet to 15 aircraft.

The new aircraft from Avolon’s orderbook are due for delivery in 2027 and 2028 and will be a key driver to reshape Etihad’s short-haul and medium-haul network and provide significant capacity growth to its Abu Dhabi hub. Etihad’s operating fleet stood at 115 aircraft as of 17 November, with a network of over 100 destinations worldwide.

Avolon was a launch customer for the A330neo programme in 2014 and has 87 A330neos in its owned and committed fleet. The A330neo is designed to fly up to 8,100 nautical miles / 15,000 kilometers non-stop and reduces fuel burn, CO2 emissions and operating cost by 25% compared to previous generation aircraft.

Andy Cronin, CEO of Avolon, commented:

“Etihad’s selection of the A330neo is a strong endorsement for the programme and reflects the high level of demand from airlines for widebody capacity. The scale of our orderbook, bolstered by our order for 75 A321neos and 15 A330neos in July, has enabled us to ensure Etihad has the capacity required for its expansion plans. We are delighted to increase our exposure to a top-tier carrier like Etihad as the Middle East continues to expand as an aviation hub.”

Antonoaldo Neves, CEO of Etihad Airways, commented:

“Avolon has been a valued partner in supporting the evolution of our fleet, and these additional A330neo and A320neo family aircraft give us the flexibility and efficiency we need for the next phase of our growth. The A330neo will play a key role in strengthening our medium-haul network, while the A320neo family supports our short-haul expansion and enhances connectivity through Abu Dhabi. We look forward to deepening our partnership with Avolon as we continue to build a modern, efficient fleet.”

“I want to emphasize that this failure was about more than the power system,” said MITEI research scientist Pablo Duenas-Martinez.
The forum’s members include MITEI companies that also participate in MIT’s Center for Environmental and Energy Policy Research (CEEPR).
Solutions from labs big and small Global energy leaders offered glimpses of their research projects.
The panel also highlighted the MIT Proto Ventures Program, an initiative to seize early-stage MIT ideas and unleash them as world-changing startups.","“We’re here to talk about really substantive changes, and we want you to be a participant in that,” said Desirée Plata, the School of Engineering Distinguished Professor of Climate and Energy in MIT’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, at Energizing@MIT: the MIT Energy Initiative’s (MITEI) Annual Research Conference that was held on Sept. 9-10.

Plata’s words resonated with the 150-plus participants from academia, industry, and government meeting in Cambridge for the conference, whose theme was “tackling emerging energy challenges.” Meeting such challenges and ultimately altering the trajectory of global climate outcomes requires partnerships, speakers agreed.

“We have to be humble and open,” said Giacomo Silvestri, chair of Eniverse Ventures at Eni, in a shared keynote address. “We cannot develop innovation just focusing on ourselves and our competencies … so we need to partner with startups, venture funds, universities like MIT and other public and private institutions.”

Added his Eni colleague, Annalisa Muccioli, head of research and technology, “The energy transition is a race we can win only by combining mature solutions ready to deploy, together with emerging technologies that still require acceleration and risk management.”

Research targets

In a conference that showcased a suite of research priorities MITEI has identified as central to ensuring a low-carbon energy future, participants shared both promising discoveries and strategies for advancing proven technologies in the face of shifting political winds and policy uncertainties.

One panel focused on grid resiliency — a topic that has moved from the periphery to the center of energy discourse as climate-driven disruptions, cyber threats, and the integration of renewables challenge legacy systems. A dramatic case in point: the April 2025 outage in Spain and Portugal that left millions without power for eight to 15 hours.

“I want to emphasize that this failure was about more than the power system,” said MITEI research scientist Pablo Duenas-Martinez. While he pinpointed technical problems with reactive power and voltage control behind the system collapse, Duenas-Martinez also called out a lack of transmission capacity with Central Europe and out-of-date operating procedures, and recommended better preparation and communication among transmission systems and utility operators.

“You can’t plan for every single eventuality, which means we need to broaden the portfolio of extreme events we prepare for,” noted Jennifer Pearce, vice president at energy company Avangrid. “We are making the system smarter, stronger, and more resilient to better protect from a wide range of threats such as storms, flooding, and extreme heat events.” Pearce noted that Avangrid’s commitment to deliver safe, reliable power to its customers necessitates “meticulous emergency planning procedures.”

The resiliency of the electric grid under greatly increased demand is an important motivation behind MITEI’s September 2025 launch of the Data Center Power Forum, which was also announced during the annual research conference. The forum will include research projects, webinars, and other content focused on energy supply and storage, grid design and management, infrastructure, and public and economic policy related to data centers. The forum’s members include MITEI companies that also participate in MIT’s Center for Environmental and Energy Policy Research (CEEPR).

Storage and transportation: Staggering challenges

Meeting climate goals to decarbonize the world by 2050 requires building around 300 terawatt-hours of storage, according to Asegun Henry, a professor in the MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering. “It’s an unbelievably enormous problem people have to wrap their minds around,” he said. Henry has been developing a high-temperature thermal energy storage system he has nicknamed “sun in a box.” His system uses liquid metal and graphite to hold electricity as heat and then convert it back to electricity, enabling storage anywhere from five to 500 hours.

“At the end of the day, storage provides a service, and the type of technology that you need is a function of the service that you value the most,” said Nestor Sepulveda, commercial lead for advanced energy investments and partnerships at Google. “I don't think there is one winner-takes-all type of market here.”

Another panel explored sustainable fuels that could help decarbonize hard-to-electrify sectors like aviation, shipping, and long-haul trucking. Randall Field, MITEI’s director of research, noted that sustainably produced drop-in fuels — fuels that are largely compatible with existing engines — “could eliminate potentially trillions of dollars of cost for fleet replacement and for infrastructure build-out, while also helping us to accelerate the rate of decarbonization of the transportation sectors.""

Erik G. Birkerts is the chief growth officer of LanzaJet, which produces a drop-in, high-energy-density aviation fuel derived from agricultural residue and other waste carbon sources. “The key to driving broad sustainable aviation fuel adoption is solving both the supply-side challenge through more production and the demand-side hurdle by reducing costs,” he said.

“We think a good policy framework [for sustainable fuels] would be something that is technology-neutral, does not exclude any pathways to produce, is based on life cycle accounting practices, and on market mechanisms,” said Veronica L. Robertson, energy products technology portfolio manager at ExxonMobil.

MITEI plans a major expansion of its research on sustainable fuels, announcing a two-year study, “The future of fuels: Pathways to sustainable transportation,” starting in early 2026. According to Field, the study will analyze and assess biofuels and e-fuels.

Solutions from labs big and small

Global energy leaders offered glimpses of their research projects. A panel on carbon capture in power generation featured three takes on the topic: Devin Shaw, commercial director of decarbonization technologies at Shell, described post-combustion carbon capture in power plants using steam for heat recovery; Jan Marsh, a global program lead at Siemens Energy, discussed deploying novel materials to capture carbon dioxide directly from the air; and Jeffrey Goldmeer, senior director of technology strategy at GE Vernova, explained integrating carbon capture into gas-powered turbine systems.

During a panel on vehicle electrification, Brian Storey, vice president of energy and materials at the Toyota Research Institute, provided an overview of Toyota’s portfolio of projects for decarbonization, including solid-state batteries, flexible manufacturing lines, and grid-forming inverters to support EV charging infrastructure.

A session on MITEI seed fund projects revealed promising early-stage research inside MIT’s own labs. A new process for decarbonizing the production of ethylene was presented by Yogesh Surendranath, Donner Professor of Science in the MIT Department of Chemistry. Materials Science and Engineering assistant professor Aristide Gumyusenge also discussed the development of polymers essential for a new kind of sodium-ion battery.

Shepherding bold, new technologies like these from academic labs into the real world cannot succeed without ample support and deft management. A panel on paths to commercialization featured the work of Iwnetim Abate, Chipman Career Development Professor and assistant professor in the MIT Department of Materials Science and Engineering, who has spun out a company, Addis Energy, based on a novel geothermal process for harvesting clean hydrogen and ammonia from subsurface, iron-rich rocks. Among his funders: ARPA-E and MIT’s own The Engine Ventures.

The panel also highlighted the MIT Proto Ventures Program, an initiative to seize early-stage MIT ideas and unleash them as world-changing startups. “A mere 4.2 percent of all the patents that are actually prosecuted in the world are ever commercialized, which seems like a shocking number,” said Andrew Inglis, an entrepreneur working with Proto Ventures to translate geothermal discoveries into businesses. “Can’t we do this better? Let’s do this better!”

Geopolitical hazards

Throughout the conference, participants often voiced concern about the impacts of competition between the United States and China. Kelly Sims Gallagher, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University and an expert on China’s energy landscape, delivered the sobering news in her keynote address: “U.S. competitiveness in low-carbon technologies has eroded in nearly every category,” she said. “The Chinese are winning the clean tech race.”

China enjoys a 51 percent share in global wind turbine manufacture and 75 percent in solar modules. It also controls low-carbon supply chains that much of the world depends on. “China is getting so dominant that nobody can carve out a comparative advantage in anything,” said Gallagher. “China is just so big, and the scale is so huge that the Chinese can truly conquer markets and make it very hard for potential competitors to find a way in.”

And for the United States, the problem is “the seesaw of energy policy,” she says. “It’s incredibly difficult for the private sector to plan and to operate, given the lack of predictability and policy here.”

Nevertheless, Gallagher believes the United States still has a chance of at least regaining competitiveness, by setting up a stable, bipartisan energy policy, rebuilding domestic manufacturing and supply chains; providing consistent fiscal incentives; attracting and retaining global talent; and fostering international collaboration.

The conference shone a light on one such collaboration: a China-U.S. joint venture to manufacture lithium iron phosphate batteries for commercial vehicles in the United States. The venture brings together Eve Energy, a Chinese battery technology and manufacturing company; Daimler, a global commercial vehicle manufacturer; PACCAR Inc., a U.S.-based truck manufacturer; and Accelera, the zero-emissions business of Cummins Inc. “Manufacturing batteries in the U.S. makes the supply chain more robust and reduces geopolitical risks,” said Mike Gerty, of PACCAR.

While she acknowledged the obstacles confronting her colleagues in the room, Plata nevertheless concluded her remarks as a panel moderator with some optimism: “I hope you all leave this conference and look back on it in the future, saying I was in the room when they actually solved some of the challenges standing between now and the future that we all wish to manifest.”",https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/images/202510/mitei-annual-conference.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 12:59:03.968475

Platinum is required across all major SAF production pathways, including Power-to Liquid (PtL), which utilises the Fischer Tropsch process (FT), as well as the FT process itself.
While current platinum demand from SAF is modest, in the long term it is expected to grow significantly.

The role of platinum Platinum plays an important supporting role in certain types of FT synthesis.","Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is emerging as a core pillar of decarbonisation in aviation, with the International Air Transport Association estimating that it could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions needed by aviation to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Unlike petroleum-based kerosene, SAF is produced from sustainable, non-petroleum feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues and municipal solid waste, or via synthetic e-fuels combining renewable electricity with captured CO₂.

Platinum is required across all major SAF production pathways, including Power-to Liquid (PtL), which utilises the Fischer Tropsch process (FT), as well as the FT process itself. While current platinum demand from SAF is modest, in the long term it is expected to grow significantly.

Originally developed by German chemists Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch, this year marks 100 years since the FT process was developed. Their research demonstrated that a mixture of the gases carbon monoxide and hydrogen could be transformed over suitable catalysts into liquid and solid hydrocarbons. Today FT is used in myriad industrial applications.

PtL is a synthetic jet fuel produced using renewable electricity, with water and CO₂ serving as the primary inputs. To create a climate-neutral carbon feedstock, green hydrogen and captured CO₂ (from the atmosphere or industrial sources) are used. These components are then combined through FT synthesis to form liquid hydrocarbons, which are subsequently refined into a kerosene-equivalent fuel.

In the FT SAF production pathway, solid materials such as biomass are first converted into synthetic gas (syngas). This syngas is then processed through FT synthesis into liquid wax. FT has significant scalability potential for SAF production as it can utilise a wide range of feedstocks, including waste materials that would otherwise be discarded. This makes it a strong candidate for commercial scale SAF production, although supportive policies and regulatory frameworks are needed to accelerate its deployment.

The role of platinum

Platinum plays an important supporting role in certain types of FT synthesis. Iron catalysts dominate biomass FT and do not use platinum.

However, cobalt catalysts are preferred in PtL FT and these use platinum as a promoter. Even at very low concentrations, platinum improves cobalt catalyst reduction, stability, and dispersion, resulting in higher efficiency and longer lifetimes.

Further, platinum has a significant role in isomerisation, which is needed in both the FT and the PtL FT SAF production pathways, where it functions as a catalyst to transform straight-chain hydrocarbons into branched isomers with superior cold-flow properties. Without this step, SAF would fail to meet the strict freezing point requirements necessary for safe, high-altitude flight.

WPIC expects annual SAF capacity additions to increase eight-fold from around 2 Mt in 2024 to approximately 16 Mt by 2050, while platinum demand from SAF production is expected to increase from negligible volumes to around 260 koz per annum by 2050. This platinum demand growth will be incremental overall, mitigating the expected decrease in petroleum platinum demand as global markets continue to make their energy transition from 2030 to 2050.",https://platinuminvestment.com/favicon-32x32.png?v=WGoYw5O7yP,N,,2025-11-18 13:56:51.988693

Over the past year, the Aviation team has demonstrated a commitment to innovation and collaboration across the SAF value chain, including its most recent agreement with DHL Express. Phillips 66’s integrated model — spanning refining, logistics and commercial operations — has been vital in supplying reliable, lower-carbon solutions for airlines worldwide.

“Our integrated model is a competitive advantage that enables resilience and value creation in the SAF market,” said Ronald Sanchez, Phillips 66 vice president of aviation. “Our people, capabilities and assets allow for feedstock optionality; our supply chain agility accounts for an evolving environment.”

Progress takes flight

Phillips 66’s SAF deal with DHL Express is one of the largest U.S. air cargo SAF agreements, supplying the logistics company with over 240,000 metric tons of SAF over three years. The SAF in this agreement is expected to reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 737,000 metric tons compared to conventional jet fuel.

The announcement is the latest in a growing list of Phillips 66 customer milestones in the last calendar year, which also includes agreements with Alaska Airlines, British Airways, Qantas Airlines and United Airlines.

Each agreement represents important steps toward decarbonization and opportunities to offer dependable, lower-carbon solutions.

Scaling up: Experience and cross-industry collaboration

Serving a broad customer base, Phillips 66 Aviation benefits from the company’s integrated portfolio and global reach.

Phillips 66 Aviation advantages:

Deep industry experience — Nearly 100 years in aviation fuel supply.

Market presence — Supplies approximately 10% of U.S. jet fuel and one of the largest branded fixed base operator (FBO) customer base.

Leading SAF assets — Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex in the U.S. has production capacity of 150 million gallons per year of neat SAF and Humber Refinery in the U.K., which is the country’s only commercial-scale producer of SAF through coprocessing.

Commercial operations — Global offices in Asia, Europe and North America with an operating network of over 80 countries.

Sanchez recently noted at the Argus North American Biofuels, LCFS & Carbon Markets Summit that there are still notable barriers to scaling SAF, stating that it will require collaboration to overcome them.

For example, Phillips 66 recently signed an agreement with Chooose to implement a SAF book-and-claim system. The system facilitates the allocation and tracking of environmental benefits from SAF when the fuel is not physically delivered to specific customers or locations. This agreement enables Phillips 66 to offer additional solutions for the aviation industry by streamlining SAF delivery and documentation, making operations more efficient and fostering collaboration.

“We’re working side by side with airlines, fuel producers, technology developers, policymakers and regulators — across the U.S. and internationally — to overcome the barriers to scaling SAF,” he said. “No single player can scale this alone. Supportive policies, regulatory certainty and reliable feedstock availability are essential to making SAF economically viable and competitive with conventional fuel.”

As the conversation and collaboration continues, Phillips 66 stands prepared to deliver energy solutions. Sanchez said, “With our refineries, midstream assets, research capabilities and commercial expertise, we are uniquely positioned to help shape the next 100 years of aviation.”",https://www.phillips66.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/BAYWAYSTILLS0060.png,N,,2025-11-18 11:56:59.380869

setting up unified fuel rules across the region

creating national laws that support it

establishing “farm-to-flight” supply chains

securing major funding

building a regional roadmap for technical collaboration.

The day also saw financial institutions globally endorse new Climate Finance Principles for Grids to standardise and scale investment in emerging economies: The principles establish a common framework to enable grid investments’ eligibility for climate finance. Institutions backing the framework include: the African Development Bank, British International Investment, East African Development Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, Climate Bonds Initiative, Institutional Investors Group for Climate Change, Asia Investor Group on Climate Change, Global Renewables Alliance, Grid Works, Utilities for Net Zero Alliance, and the UK Government.

The Asian Development Bank and World Bank announced $12.5bn (£9.5bn) in combined financing to strengthen the ASEAN Power Grid. The Inter-American Development Bank launched the Power Transmission Acceleration Platform for Latin America and the Caribbean, with Germany committing €15M (£13.2M) to support grid expansion and modernisation.

The Energy Efficiency De-Risking Platform also launched – a new mechanism to connect investors with project pipelines, with partners including development finance institutions, international organisations and the private sector. The de-risking facility will be a one-stop marketplace that countries can access for support on project preparation, technical assistance and instruments for de-risking in the following sectors: industry, transport, buildings, appliances, and lighting.

Last week, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) confirmed its Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy for all passengers who depart from the country to another destination.

The tax is set based on the volume of SAF needed to meet its one per cent SAF target for 2026, as well as the projected price premium of SAF and “other associated costs”.

Singapore’s air tax. How much will I have to pay?

The levy varies based on the distanceflyers are travelling, and has been categorised into four geographical bands.

Europe, along with Africa, Central and West Asia, the Middle East, Pacific Islands and New Zealand, has been placed in band four.

This is subject to a S$6.40 (€4.24) tax per passenger for economy cabins (which includes Premium Economy seats) and a S$25.60 (€16.96) tax for premium cabins, which includes business class and first class.

The Americas have been placed in band five, and will be subject to a S$10.40 (€6.89) and S$41.60 (€27.57) charge, respectively.

Band two, which includes Northeast Asia, South Asia,Australiaand Papua New Guinea will be hit with a S$3.80 (€2.52) and S$11.20 (€7.42) charge.

Southeast Asia is the only area in band one, with passengers only having to pay S$1 (€0.66) or S$4 (€2.65) depending on their cabin class.

Flyers transiting through Singapore will not be stung by the charge.

What if I’m on a connecting flight?

For flights with multiple stops, the SAF levy is only applied on the “immediate next destination” after departing Singapore.

For example, if you’re flying from Singapore to Paris via a layover in Amsterdam, you will only have to pay the levy on the Singapore to Amsterdam part of the journey.

The airline will collect the SAF Levy and must display the tax as a “distinct line item” on the air ticket when sold.

Certain flights, such as training flights and flights for charitable or humanitarian purposes, will not be subject to the levy.

Singapore’s sustainability efforts

Last year, CAAS released the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint, outlining the country’s approach to sustainable growth in the aviation sector.

This plan aims to reduce domestic aviation emissions from airport operations by 20 per cent from 2019 levels by 2030, and to achieve net-zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.

Director-General of CAAS Han Hok Juan says the new rules mark a major step in Singapore’s effort to build a “more sustainable and competitive” air hub.

“It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub,” he adds.

“We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.”",https://images.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/55/27/40/1200x675_cmsv2_714da33a-381f-5f98-b8f1-5b3f44d3d1e4-9552740.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 10:57:08.347637

In the transition towards the goal of net-zero carbon emissions for international aviation by 2050, as set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), sustainable aviation fuel is considered an important asset. Made from waste products and plant material, SAF could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to normal fossil jet fuels, according to Neste, a Finnish oil refining and marketing company.

At the moment, however, demand far surpasses supply, making SAF a costly subject. To make the decarbonation process of its aviation industry more feasible and to support Singapore’s goal of having 1% of all jet fuel used at the Changi and Seletar Airports come from SAF by 2026, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has announced the introduction of a state-wide SAF levy.

One levy, multiple factors

The levy will apply to all passengers departing from the country (those who are simply transiting will not be concerned) as of 1 October 2026. Tickets sold from 1 April 2026 onwards will be subject to the tax, the amount of which will depend on two factors.

Firstly, the cabin in which the passenger will be flying will determine part of the tax. Economy and Premium seats will be categorised as ‘Economy’, while Business and First Class seats will be considered as ‘Premium’. Secondly, the distance travelled by passengers will play a role. Destinations have been categorised by four geographical bands:

Southeast Asia

Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, and Papua New Guinea

Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Pacific Islands, and New Zealand

The Americas

Following that categorisation, prices will range from S$1 (€0.66) for economy class passengers flying to Bangkok or S$10.40 (€6.89) for those travelling to New York. Levies for Premium travellers will be multiplied by four. Cargo will be taxed by the kilogram, while general and business aviation flights are to be charged on a per-aircraft basis.

The new levy will be paid directly by the passenger and will be displayed as a distinct line item on airline tickets. Thereafter, all levies will go into a statutory SAF fund to be managed by CAAS.

“The Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company Ltd. (SAFCo) will manage the procurement, allocation, and administration of SAF and EAs, to get the best value for money and ensure transparency and accountability in the use of the fund. CAAS will continue to engage airlines, aircraft operators, and other industry stakeholders in the coming weeks and work with them on implementation”, CAAS declared in a statement.

Whether or not passengers will end up paying the full levy themselves or not, remains to be seen, as it is possible that airlines will adapt their fares accordingly in order to remain competitive in the region.",https://traveltomorrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/aviation-fuel.jpg#161580,N,,2025-11-18 10:57:17.317013

This accomplishment marks the world’s first instance of a commercial facility generating jet fuel from ethanol feedstock and represents the first non-petroleum renewable aviation fuel solution fully compatible with today’s aircraft and existing fueling infrastructure.
It provides definitive proof that ethanol can be converted into jet fuel at commercial volumes, addressing a long-standing challenge in aviation’s journey toward lower-carbon operations.
LanzaJet not only invested in but also engineered, constructed, integrated, and commissioned these systems to create the world’s first commercial-scale ethanol-to-jet fuel production facility.","LanzaJet, Inc., a prominent innovator in next-generation fuel technologies and a producer of sustainable fuels, has announced a major milestone for the global aviation sector. The company has successfully operated its commercial-scale LanzaJet Freedom Pines Fuels plant in Soperton, Georgia, USA, producing jet fuel derived entirely from ethanol. This accomplishment marks the world’s first instance of a commercial facility generating jet fuel from ethanol feedstock and represents the first non-petroleum renewable aviation fuel solution fully compatible with today’s aircraft and existing fueling infrastructure.

This achievement is the result of 15 years of persistent scientific advancement, industry collaboration, investment, and progressive scaling efforts. It provides definitive proof that ethanol can be converted into jet fuel at commercial volumes, addressing a long-standing challenge in aviation’s journey toward lower-carbon operations. With the traditional HEFA bio-oil pathway nearing limits in both availability and qualification of feedstocks, LanzaJet’s proprietary Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology now opens the door for the next major wave of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) development. The technology is suited to diverse regions across the world and offers a timely solution for an industry urgently seeking alternatives to fossil-based fuels.

Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet, described the achievement as a powerful example of what becomes possible when innovation, dedication, resilience, and collaborative effort converge to build a new industrial model. He emphasized that the milestone is not only significant for LanzaJet and its investors but also a notable breakthrough for global aviation, offering renewed optimism for the future of sustainable flight. Samartzis added that LanzaJet’s journey has consistently been mission-driven—focused on scaling a new industry, creating economic and environmental value, and honoring its commitments despite challenges. According to him, the company now stands uniquely equipped with both technological expertise and operational experience to influence the trajectory of SAF production in the coming decade.

LanzaJet’s ATJ technology is one of the most impactful SAF innovations to reach commercial readiness in nearly ten years. It relies on globally abundant ethanol resources and can tap into additional ethanol produced from waste materials and recycled carbon. This broad feedstock flexibility gives nations an opportunity to strengthen agricultural sectors, foster new economic development, and boost domestic energy resilience. With ATJ, countries can also localize fuel supply chains, improving control over production and distribution.

The Freedom Pines Fuels facility is expected to serve as a foundational model for expanding SAF production internationally. It is the first fully integrated First-of-a-Kind (FOAK) plant utilizing multiple breakthrough technologies, including Technip Energies’ Hummingbird® Ethanol-to-Ethylene system and an Oligomerization solution developed jointly by the U.S. Department of Energy and LanzaTech. LanzaJet not only invested in but also engineered, constructed, integrated, and commissioned these systems to create the world’s first commercial-scale ethanol-to-jet fuel production facility.

The ATJ process is capable of converting a wide range of sustainable feedstocks such as municipal solid waste, agricultural residues, energy crops, and captured carbon into low-carbon jet fuel. When blended with Jet A-1, the fuel meets global certification standards and can seamlessly power existing aircraft without modifications. LanzaJet is already deploying its technology across multiple regions—including the U.S., Australia, India, Japan, the UK, the European Union, Colombia, the Middle East, and Kazakhstan.

Located in Treutlen County, less than 100 miles from Savannah, the Freedom Pines Fuels plant required an investment of more than $300 million. During construction, it supported over 300 jobs and has since created more than 65 direct and indirect ongoing positions. LanzaJet’s accomplishment builds on a history of pioneering achievements that began within LanzaTech in 2012, when the ethanol-to-SAF pathway was first explored. This early effort moved from laboratory experiments to pilot and demonstration facilities, eventually earning ASTM approval in 2016. The technology went on to power initial commercial test flights with Virgin Atlantic and All Nippon Airways in 2018 and 2019, respectively—laying the groundwork for this monumental commercial-scale breakthrough.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-18 10:58:06.778060

Policy signal: 2026–2030 guidance encourages surplus wind and solar to be converted into green hydrogen and related e-fuels to reduce curtailment.

Cost frame: order-of-magnitude transport costs near 0.10–0.24 dollars per kilogram per 1,000 kilometers depending on repurposed or new lines.

Energy equivalent: ≈ 56.6 TWh/year combined (LHV)—about 3.33 TWh from the 400 km line’s 100,000 t/yr plus ~53.3 TWh from the 1,038 km spine’s 1.6 Mt/yr.

Primary near-term users: refineries, chemicals, and steel in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei cluster.

From Pilot Projects to a Hydrogen Backbone

The 400-kilometer Inner Mongolia to Beijing Line

Approval and Route

Sinopec’s project links Ulanqab’s wind and solar resources with the Beijing market through a 400 kilometer corridor. The route was profiled as China’s first cross‑provincial green hydrogen pipeline and established a template for future connections between renewable‑rich interiors and capital‑region demand, as profiled by Reuters.

Capacity and Phasing

The initial capacity target is about 100,000 tonnes per year, allowing for staged expansions as upstream electrolyzers scale and as downstream offtake grows. Electrolyzers use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Matching electrolyzer ramp-up with pipeline utilization is essential, since pipe load factors determine delivered costs.

Schedule note: As of November 2025, no official completion or commissioning date for the 400 kilometer line has been published by authorities or the developer.

How Much Energy is 100K Tonnes of Hydrogen?

At 100,000 tonnes per year, the hydrogen energy content is roughly 3.33 terawatt-hours annually on a lower heating value basis, equal to about 3.33 billion kilowatt-hours. In simpler terms, this amount of energy is equivalent to about fifty million electric vehicle charges of 70 kilowatt-hours each or the chemical energy found in roughly 350 million liters of gasoline, illustrating how much energy a single cross-provincial pipeline can transport when operating continuously.

First Sinks and System Integration

Beijing’s refining and chemical hubs can absorb hydrogen sooner than sectors that require major equipment changes. Early displacement of fossil-based hydrogen in refining and chemical feedstocks provides an immediate emissions reduction while larger conversions progress.

The 1,038-kilometer North China Spine

Nodes and Route Span

The new network connects northern renewables, including zones near Zhangjiakou, with demand clusters around Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan. It creates a backbone that can tie multiple production parks, storage sites, and offtakers into a single corridor. This approach is far more efficient than connecting many isolated projects. Recent investments expanded wind and solar capacity in Inner Mongolia, strengthening the case for long‑distance molecules and a large wind and solar base in Inner Mongolia.

Throughput Ambition and Timeline

At full buildout, the trunk line is planned to carry on the order of 1.6 million tonnes of hydrogen per year, far above the throughput of any single pilot. Construction began on November 3, 2025, which initiated detailed engineering, compressor siting, and interconnection works, according to industry reporting.

In energy terms, 1.6 million tonnes of hydrogen per year corresponds to approximately 53.3 terawatt-hours (LHV), which is equivalent to about 53.3 billion kilowatt-hours, roughly 760 million charges for 70 kWh electric vehicles, or the chemical energy found in around six billion liters of gasoline.

Schedule note: As of November 2025, a firm completion or commissioning date for the 1,038 kilometer network has not been publicly announced.

Regional Benefits and Risks

A spine condenses scattered pilot lessons into a single shared asset. Benefits include lower per-unit transport expenses at scale, fewer truck movements, and a clearer outlook for industrial decarbonization near the capital. Risks include underutilization if electrolyzer projects or offtake agreements lag. Policymaker direction for 2026 through 2030 increases the likelihood that supply and demand will scale in tandem.

The Economic Case for Pipelines Over Trucking

Cost and Distance Thresholds

For short- to mid-range distances on land, pipelines move large volumes with fewer losses and lower labor intensity than fleets of tube trailers. Repurposed gas lines can be especially economical, while new hydrogen pipelines remain competitive for distances under a few thousand kilometers, a pattern reflected in IRENA’s global trade analysis. Global buildouts in Europe are following similar patterns at the industrial-scale large European green hydrogen buildout.

New Versus Repurposed Lines

Repurposed lines can offer lower capital costs if materials and safety standards are met. New hydrogen-dedicated lines give operators immediate control over metallurgy, coatings, and design pressures. The International Energy Agency’s review summarizes how these choices interact with overall market creation, policy clarity, and utilization rates in its 2024 assessment, the International Energy Agency’s 2024 review.

Safety, Compression, and Blending Considerations

Hydrogen is a small molecule that requires specific pipeline materials and compressors to prevent embrittlement and leaks. Blending small shares of hydrogen into existing gas grids is one transition strategy, but hydrogen‑dedicated pipes are necessary for delivering high‑purity molecules for green steel or fuel cells.

The North China spine is purpose‑built for hydrogen, not a blend. Transporting hydrogen as ammonia or in liquid organic carriers (LOHC) is common for maritime routes but less practical for domestic trunk lines where high‑volume gas flow is needed. Green steel pathways are also advancing to use hydrogen as a reducing agent in direct‑reduced ironmaking green steel pathways.

Solving Curtailment by Converting Electrons to Molecules

China’s wind and solar buildout sometimes produces more electricity than local grids can absorb at a given moment. This forces operators to curtail, or waste, that generation. Converting a portion of those excess electrons into hydrogen creates a portable energy carrier that can be moved to where demand is stronger and stored for later use.

The new backbone pipelines give that strategy scale, since molecules can flow continuously from Inner Mongolia’s renewable parks to the Beijing region even when the grid is saturated. China’s clean‑power scaling has simultaneously driven down costs while expanding capacity for clean power scaling and costs.

The Policy Driving the “Electrons-to-Molecules” Strategy

The NEA’s 2026–2030 Push

National guidance for 2026 through 2030 asks provinces to channel surplus wind and solar into green hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel. The aim is practical: reduce curtailment while creating low‑emissions inputs for heavy industry and transport. This policy backdrop is crucial because it synchronizes electrolyzer deployment with pipeline interconnections and industrial offtake planning.

Where Curtailment Appears and Why Pipes Help

Inner Mongolia and surrounding provinces host large wind and solar bases that can outpace local demand during certain hours. Electrolyzers located near those bases can operate when prices are low, then send hydrogen along the 400 kilometer corridor toward end users near the capital. Long trunklines also make it easier to add new production nodes over time without rebuilding logistics entirely.

How Curtailment, Electrolyzers, and Pipes Connect

The pipeline acts as a “virtual transmission line” for molecules. This is often more economical than building new ultra‑high‑voltage power lines just to manage a few hours of surplus generation. Storing hydrogen near the electrolyzer and releasing it steadily into the pipe allows the pipeline to run at a high, stable load factor, a key factor in lowering the final delivered cost. The aim is to convert energy that would be wasted into a valuable commodity, not to replace the power grid, which must still balance supply and demand from a single province or a single hour of the day.

Electrolyzer Siting and Storage

Developers balance three variables when they place electrolyzers: access to cheap renewable electricity, water supply and treatment, and pipeline tie‑ins.

Storage options, such as above-ground tanks and underground caverns, can smooth hourly variations so that pipelines run with steadier, more efficient flows. This combination of local electrolyzers and storage is what allows the pipeline backbone to absorb the surpluses created by China’s massive wind and solar expansion.

Industrial Decarbonization where it Counts

Hydrogen delivered by pipe is most useful in applications where it is already part of the process. For this reason, the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei cluster, with its refineries, chemical complexes, and steelmakers, is central to the backbone’s development. Replacing fossil‑based hydrogen in these facilities cuts emissions without waiting for entirely new equipment classes.

First Sinks: Refining, Chemicals, and Steel

Refineries use hydrogen to remove sulfur and to upgrade fuels. Chemical plants rely on it for ammonia and methanol pathways. Steelmakers are piloting direct reduced iron routes that substitute hydrogen for the carbon-based reducing agents traditionally supplied by coal. Early examples show how these substitutions work in practice, including a large green steel pilot that defines a path for heavier industrial loads like large green steel pilots, such as a project that links renewables to metallurgical demand through green hydrogen ironmaking in Australia.

Refining and Chemicals

Given their existing hydrogen consumption, these sectors can seamlessly integrate cleaner molecules, as long as they meet the necessary purity and pressure standards. Over time, higher shares of green hydrogen can be introduced as supply grows and as equipment is upgraded. Contracts that lock in minimum volumes help improve pipeline utilization and reduce delivered cost volatility.

Steel and High‑Heat Loads

Steel requires high temperatures and reducing conditions. Projects that pair hydrogen with electric arc furnaces or with direct‑reduced iron units can significantly lower emissions relative to blast furnaces that rely on coal. The backbone enables pilot quantities to scale into routine supply, which is essential for consistent plant operation.

Cost Reality: Molecule Cost Versus End‑Product Price

Clean hydrogen often costs more at the molecule level than today’s fossil‑based alternative. However, when the cost is spread across complex products such as refined fuels or chemicals, the effect on final prices is usually modest. That is why policy, long‑term contracts, and high utilization work together; they stabilize the economics while industry converts equipment over multi‑year timelines.

Utilization Matters: Lessons from Early Projects

Early green hydrogen projects in China have shown that first‑year output can lag nameplate targets as operators adjust power supply, water treatment, compression, and maintenance schedules. Those lessons inform how backbone pipelines will be used. The more consistently the pipe runs near its design flow, the lower the transport cost per kilogram, and the stronger the business case for industrial offtakers. In road transport, hydrogen passenger vehicles serve limited but specific niches hydrogen passenger vehicles.

China’s 2030 Hydrogen Outlook: Economics, Policy, and High Energy Milestones

The success of China’s hydrogen backbone strategy will be measured by utilization rates, delivered cost to factories, and the pace of industrial conversions in the capital region.

Domestic Demand Versus Export Pull

Pipelines primarily serve domestic industry, yet export markets are still important because they influence investment and standards. Ammonia and synthetic fuels offer another route for moving clean energy over long distances; as such, domestic pipelines and maritime vectors should be viewed as complementary, not competing, systems.

Carbon‑to‑fuels pathways convert captured CO₂ into energy carriers for transport sectors’ carbon‑to‑fuels methods. Domestic ammonia and e-fuels also remain important complements to watch in this market.

Sensitivities: Load Factors, Delivered Cost, and Policy Follow‑Through

Three inputs dominate the economics: electrolyzer capacity factors, pipeline load factors, and electricity prices. Higher utilization lowers transport cost per kilogram and spreads fixed costs across more output. Policy follow‑through on permitting, water resource planning, and grid connections will determine how quickly new nodes can tie into the spine.

Sustainability: Why Hydrogen Outperforms Petrol

Green hydrogen from renewable electricity has near-zero operational CO₂ at the point of use and produces only water in fuel cells, while petrol releases CO₂ and other pollutants in combustion and adds upstream emissions from extraction, transport, and refining.

Piped supply reduces truck movements compared with tube-trailer logistics, improving traffic and noise footprints. Local air quality benefits when clean hydrogen displaces fossil-based hydrogen in refineries and when industrial combustion shifts to lower-emission processes.

Practical safety measures are still important, such as strict control of hydrogen leaks, responsible water use for electrolysis, and high safety standards. With those controls in place, delivering about 56.6 TWh per year of green hydrogen positions the region to cut greenhouse gases and particulate pollution at scale.

Energy per Tonne: Hydrogen versus Petrol

On a mass basis, hydrogen carries far more chemical energy than petrol. Using lower heating values, hydrogen is about 33.33 MWh per tonne (≈120 MJ/kg), while petrol is about 12.22 MWh per tonne (≈44 MJ/kg). This means that hydrogen contains approximately 2.7 times more energy than petrol when compared on a tonne-for-tonne basis.

When applied to the combined pipeline supply of approximately 56.6 TWh per year, equating that energy solely with petrol would necessitate approximately 4.63 million tonnes of petrol (roughly 6.2 billion liters at 0.75 kg per liter), compared to approximately 1.70 million tonnes of hydrogen. These comparisons are energy content only; real‑world outcomes also depend on device efficiency and logistics, but the mass‑based contrast is stark.

Milestones to Watch

2026 through 2027: phased electrolyzer additions near Inner Mongolia with first tie‑ins to the 400 kilometer link.

2027 through 2028: initial flows to refineries and chemical plants in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region and early steel trials that rely on continuous supply.

2029 through 2030: expansion of the North China spine with additional nodes and larger storage, plus maturing of long‑term offtake contracts.

A New Hydrogen Artery for Industrial Decarbonization

China’s hydrogen buildout is clearly pivoting from isolated pilots to integrated infrastructure. The 400-kilometer Inner Mongolia-to-Beijing link and the 1,038-kilometer North China spine create a crucial highway for clean molecules. This new backbone provides a practical, large-scale solution to renewable energy curtailment by converting surplus wind and solar into a transportable, stable energy carrier.

This pipeline infrastructure is a direct enabler of industrial decarbonization for the capital region. By providing a steady supply of green hydrogen to refineries, chemical plants, and steelmakers, the backbone allows heavy industry to substitute cleaner inputs. If developers maintain high utilization rates and policy remains aligned, these pipelines will turn climate ambition into daily operations, converting surplus electrons into the molecules that power a cleaner industrial future.

Key Questions on China’s Hydrogen Pipeline

What is the Purpose of the North China Hydrogen Spine?

The 1,038-km spine is a large-scale hydrogen pipeline network designed to transport green hydrogen from renewable-rich regions, like Inner Mongolia, to the industrial and urban demand centers around Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei. Its primary goals are to reduce renewable energy curtailment and provide clean fuel for industrial decarbonization.

Why use Pipelines instead of Trucking for Hydrogen?

While trucks are suitable for smaller, local delivery, pipelines are far more economical for moving large volumes of hydrogen over long distances. Pipelines offer lower transport costs per kilogram, higher throughput, and reduced labor intensity compared to a fleet of tube trailers.

How does this Pipeline Help with Energy Curtailment?

Curtailment happens when renewable sources like wind and solar produce more electricity than the grid can use, forcing operators to shut them down. These pipelines allow that surplus electricity to be used to power electrolyzers, converting the excess energy into green hydrogen, which can then be stored and transported to where it’s needed.

What Industries are the First Users of this Hydrogen?

The primary near-term users (or “first sinks”) are heavy industries in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei cluster that already use hydrogen in their processes. This includes refineries (for removing sulfur), chemical plants (for making ammonia and methanol), and steelmakers who are piloting green hydrogen for cleaner iron production.",https://www.intelligentliving.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Chinas-56.6-TWhyr-Hydrogen-Pipeline-Network-A-1.7Mt-Backbone-for-Green-Industrial-Fuel.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 10:59:03.333091

The focus is on improving consistency, transparency, and accuracy in how suppliers document both conventional aviation fuel and sustainable aviation fuel. This update offers a clearer path for compliance and supports the broader transition toward cleaner aviation.

What the Guidance Covers

Clear Reporting Expectations

The document outlines who must report, what information needs to be submitted, and the timelines involved. Suppliers are expected to track the fuel they provide at Union airports between January and December each year and submit their reports by mid February of the following year. This structured cycle gives suppliers a predictable rhythm for data collection and verification.

Distinction Between Supply To and Supply At Airports

One of the most helpful clarifications is the difference between fuel delivered to an airport and fuel supplied at the airport for actual consumption. This avoids confusion and ensures that only fuel that is physically provided to aircraft is counted toward sustainability obligations.

Improved Traceability and Data Quality

The guidance emphasises robust documentation such as certificates of sustainability and fuel quality records. It also highlights how suppliers should distinguish between sustainable fuel that counts toward regulatory targets and fuel used for voluntary climate programmes.

Why This Matters

These updates build confidence in the accuracy of aviation fuel reporting. They also support a more efficient shift to sustainable fuels by reducing ambiguity. For sustainability professionals, this clarity helps streamline conversations with suppliers, regulators, and aviation partners.

Our consultancy can help organisations interpret these requirements and design reporting systems that align smoothly with operational realities and environmental goals. This enables teams to stay ahead of compliance needs while strengthening their sustainability position.

Conclusion

The updated guidance is more than a compliance document. It is a practical tool that simplifies reporting, strengthens traceability, and supports the aviation sector as it moves toward cleaner operations. Sustainability teams that act early will benefit from smoother reporting cycles and stronger environmental strategies.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-11-1.svg,N,,2025-11-18 09:56:19.075633

Currently, Emirates (EK) and Etihad Airways (EY) operate under a “soft requirement” that encourages them to use one percent of SAF by 2031, but the government now aims to move to a compulsory mandate.

Al Olama revealed the shift ahead of a meeting of the UAE government’s SAF & Low Carbon Aviation Fuel (LCAF) Executive Committee held alongside Airbus at the Dubai Airshow.

According to Aviation Week, He said the earlier voluntary policy was introduced to measure the national airlines’ willingness and test market readiness.

The transition from voluntary to mandatory SAF use reflects a more assertive stance by the UAE government.

Al Olama said policymakers are now assessing how a mandate would affect airline operations and how added costs might ultimately be passed on to passengers.

The government is seeking a careful balance: promoting sustainability while protecting the financial health of its national carriers.

UAE’s Production Ambition

Despite its cautious policy rollout, the UAE remains deeply committed to rapidly scaling SAF production. Al Olama described the country as “ready to hit the ground running” and stressed its capacity to drive the global transition.

Part of that strategy involves a proposed SAF production plant in Hong Kong (HKG), in partnership with UK-based Chinook Hydrogen. If successful, Al Olama envisions it serving as a model for similar domestic facilities.

Domestically, the UAE is already making tangible progress. A SAF plant is under development in the Fujairah Oil Industry Zone (FOIZ), backed by MENA Biofuels.

It aims to process used cooking oil and waste to produce certified SAF in quantities aligned with the country’s 2030 roadmap.

Phase I of the project, costing US$200 million, will yield 125 million litres annually — roughly 18 percent of the UAE’s 2030 target — and a second phase will double that production.

Cost Implications

Implementing a SAF mandate could raise the cost of airline operations, since SAF remains more expensive than conventional jet fuel. Al Olama acknowledged that the government is cautious about how these costs could affect ticket prices.

He emphasized that further studies are underway to understand and mitigate any financial burden on airlines — and by extension, passengers.

Beyond domestic goals, the UAE sees itself as a global leader in the sustainable aviation transition. By investing in SAF infrastructure and innovation, Al Olama argued that the country can influence international SAF adoption.

He described the UAE’s approach as pragmatic but ambitious — combining market incentives, production scale, and regulatory action.

Bottom Line

The UAE is poised to shift from a voluntary SAF policy to a mandatory mandate for its airlines, signaling a major step in its environmental strategy.

With a 1 percent voluntary target already in place for 2031, the government is now studying the economic and operational impact of making SAF use compulsory. At the same time, it is scaling up domestic production through a SAF plant in Fujairah and exploring international collaborations like a proposed facility in Hong Kong.

The move underscores the UAE’s ambition to lead globally in sustainable aviation, balancing green goals with economic realities

As small- and mid-sized aviation companies navigate the pressure to reduce emissions and align with decarbonization goals, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is emerging as a transformative force. At BrightPath Associates LLC, we believe that successful adoption of SAF is not just a technical challenge - it's a strategic leadership opportunity.

Why SAF Matters More Than Ever

The environmental impact of aviation cannot be ignored. Commercial air travel contributes significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions, and SAF offers a powerful lever for change. Unlike traditional jet fuel derived from fossil sources, SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by a substantial margin because it is produced from renewable feedstocks, such as waste oils, agricultural residues, or synthetic processes.

According to Markets and Markets, the U.S. SAF market is projected to grow from USD 0.86 billion in 2024 to USD 6.97 billion by 2030, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 46.8%. This surge is driven by policy incentives, demand from airlines, and private-sector investment.

The State of SAF Adoption in the U.S.

Despite its promise, SAF currently represents just a tiny fraction of total jet fuel usage. In recent years, production has started to scale up, but adoption remains in its infancy. For example, according to the Iowa-based SAF pathway analysis, in 2022, U.S. SAF production was less than 0.1% of total jet fuel usage. However, the commitment is growing: under the U.S. Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge, the goal is to reach 3 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2030.

Key challenges remain. The cost of producing SAF is significantly higher than conventional jet fuel, primarily because of expensive feedstocks and complex processing technologies. Moreover, blending limits for SAF pose technical and regulatory constraints: not all SAF types can be used at high blend ratios with existing engines.

Drivers Powering SAF Growth

1. Policy & Incentives

Several U.S. government initiatives strongly support SAF adoption. Tax credits, such as those under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), make SAF more commercially viable. State-level efforts also contribute. For instance, certain regions are forming public–private partnerships to scale SAF production and use.

2. Rising Production Capacity

Thanks to growing industry investment, domestic SAF production capacity is expanding rapidly. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects a sharp rise in production in the near term. By scaling up co-processing in existing refineries or building dedicated bio-refineries, more SAF will flow into the supply chain.

3. Airline Commitments

Airlines are increasingly embracing SAF as part of their sustainability goals. Many major U.S. carriers have already started blending SAF into their operations or entering long-term offtake agreements. This demand from the airline side is crucial, because without strong offtake, SAF producers may struggle to justify further investments.

4. Technology Innovation

SAF production is benefiting from technological advances in multiple pathways:

- HEFA-SPK (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) – processed from waste oils and non-food lipids.

- Power-to-Liquid (PtL) – using CO₂ and renewable electricity to create synthetic fuels.

- Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) – where biomass-derived alcohols are converted into jet fuel precursors.

These innovations not only improve sustainability but also unlock new feedstock options, helping scale SAF in a cost-effective way.

Strategic Implications for Small- to Mid-Sized Aviation Firms

For small and mid-sized aviation companies, navigating SAF adoption means more than just securing fuel — it’s about strategic leadership and talent alignment:

- Talent Gap in SAF & Sustainability: To scale SAF integration, aviation businesses need leadership that understands both the technical and regulatory dimensions. Roles such as Sustainability Directors, Vice Presidents of Environmental Strategy, and SAF Program Managers are increasingly critical. These leaders will oversee collaborations with fuel producers, manage offtake contracts, and align business strategy with sustainability targets.

- Partnership Ecosystems: Companies must build strategic partnerships — not just with fuel producers, but also with regulators, R&D firms, and sustainability organizations. These partnerships help navigate funding, innovation, and compliance challenges.

- Risk Management & Scenario Planning: SAF adoption brings uncertainties: feedstock availability, cost volatility, policy shifts. Leadership teams should adopt a data-driven, scenario-based approach to manage risk — using analytics to forecast SAF demand, cost implications, and long-term ROI.

- Brand & Market Positioning: Early adoption of SAF can become a differentiator. Small- to mid-sized aviation companies that position themselves as sustainability pioneers can attract not only environmentally-conscious customers, but also forward-thinking investors and talent.

Looking Ahead: A Call to Action

The adoption of sustainable aviation fuel in the U.S. is no longer a speculative idea — it’s a fast-accelerating reality. But for many small- to mid-sized aviation companies, the path is not obvious. What will define success is not just who builds the fuel plants, but who leads within these companies.

SGD $1 for economy, SGD $4 for premium.
This is part of the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint, which aims to help Singapore achieve net-zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.
The money collected from the levy will go into a statutory fund used to purchase sustainable aviation fuel, which is more expensive than regular fuel.

This only applies to outbound passengers and not transit passengers.

Don’t worry, the levy isn’t unreasonable, especially if you tend to travel on a budget. The amount charged depends on the distance flown and whether you’re in economy or a premium cabin (business and first class).

This means that if you typically fly economy or premium economy, your lowest levy will be just SGD $1 to fly within Southeast Asia, and the highest will be SGD $10.40 to fly to the Americas. That said, if you fly business or first class, you’ll pay four times more than economy travellers, which means SGD $4.00 to fly within Southeast Asia, and SGD $41.60 to fly to the Americas. This is because longer flights consume more fuel.

The bands and prices are as follows:

Band 1, Southeast Asia. SGD $1 for economy, SGD $4 for premium.

Band 2, Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, Papua New Guinea. SGD $2.80 for economy, SGD $11.20 for premium.

Band 3, Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific Islands, and New Zealand. SGD $6.40 for economy, SGD $25.60 for premium.

Band 4, Americas. SGD $10.40 for economy, SGD $41.60 for premium.

It’s still extra money out of your pocket, but take heart in the fact that you’re supporting meaningful change for the environment. Mr Han Kok Juan, director-general of CAAS, said that the levy’s introduction “marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub”. This is part of the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint, which aims to help Singapore achieve net-zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.

The money collected from the levy will go into a statutory fund used to purchase sustainable aviation fuel, which is more expensive than regular fuel. Singapore intends to use sustainable fuel for 1 percent of all its fuel needs.

LanzaJet Freedom Pines Fuels in Soperton Georgia is now fully online, becoming the first commercial facility on the planet to turn ethanol into drop in jet fuel. The two hundred million dollar plant completed final commissioning on 13 November 2025 and is designed to deliver nine million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel and one million gallons of renewable diesel during its first year. Backed by investors such as Shell British Airways and Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, the project demonstrates real world confidence in clean aviation.

How the technology works

The process converts agricultural or waste based ethanol into synthetic paraffinic kerosene through dehydration oligomerisation and hydrogenation steps. Because it uses widely available ethanol, the technology can scale quickly without relying on limited lipids.

· Feedstock flexibility allows operators to switch between corn sugarcane and cellulosic ethanol as markets evolve.

· The finished fuel blends seamlessly at up to fifty percent with conventional Jet A without any engine modification.

· Lifecycle analysis indicates potential carbon savings above seventy percent compared with fossil jet fuel.

A regional ripple effect

A less obvious insight is the strategic location. Southeastern farmers already ship more than one billion bushels of corn annually. By providing a premium local outlet, the plant can stabilise seasonal grain prices and encourage adoption of regenerative cropping that lifts soil health. In turn, rural rail and

trucking networks gain steady high value freight flows, tightening the loop between agriculture and low carbon transport.

Conclusion

Freedom Pines proves that commercial scale ethanol to jet conversion is no longer theory but operating reality. As airlines line up multi year offtake agreements, the Georgia model offers a template cities and states can adapt to attract green investment, strengthen farm incomes and help aviation climb toward net zero.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-4-1.svg,N,,2025-11-18 07:56:45.765569

The oil and gas industry operates through highly complex systems in which upstream, midstream and downstream segments often follow distinct strategies and priorities. Upstream focuses on exploration and production efficiency, midstream prioritises secure and reliable supply routes, while downstream aims to enhance refining performance and reduce environmental impact. Aligning these three sectors towards a single goal — decarbonisation — remains one of the greatest challenges. Reducing emissions across exploration, transportation and refining requires technological innovation as well as cross-sector collaboration and consistent strategic alignment.

For these goals, the Oil & Gas Decarbonisation Congress (DECARBON) 2026 unites global industry leaders from the whole value chain to exchange practical insights and proven approaches that deliver measurable results. Throughout the Congress, companies across upstream, midstream and downstream share their experiences and innovations from P2X technologies and green hydrogen to AI-powered autonomous plants.

In the upstream-focused session, Kuwait Oil Company offers valuable perspectives on integrating energy transition strategies into exploration and production planning. Fayez Al-Mezel, Business Planning Specialist, delivers the presentation about the integration of energy transition into upstream strategies. He addresses key challenges such as capital-cost dispersion, technology readiness and infrastructure constraints. The speaker outlines mitigation measures, including modular pilot projects, standardised designs and verified data management. This approach demonstrates how strategic planning and transparent performance tracking translate decarbonisation ambitions into efficient, cost-competitive outcomes.

In the midstream discussion, LiveEO (Session Sponsor) highlights digital tools that enhance pipeline safety and sustainability. Nick Ferguson, Chief Evangelist, explains that satellite technology elevates pipeline safety.

A.D. Banker helps agents navigate client options impacted by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). While ACA changed the standard for how individuals apply for health coverage, it also created limitations for underwriting in ACA-compliant applications but ultimately helped make health insurance more accessible to everyone.

As agents assist clients through health insurance applications, it’s important to understand the key differences between ACA and Non-ACA health plans. Having this knowledge not only helps an agent find the right coverage for their clients but also builds trust and partnership.

Even though the ACA made health coverage far more accessible, there are still those that fall outside the ACA’s requirements. These policies are sold outside of the Health Insurance Marketplace and still use medical underwriting to determine eligibility and premiums, which is why A.D. Banker has created a comprehensive overview.

ACA-compliant plans follow the federal regulations established by the ACA. Non-ACA plans, on the other hand, often do not – which can affect everything from coverage and consumer protections to renewability and underwriting.

Key lessons in this article by A.D. Banker include:

Under the MoU, XCF and BGN intend to collaborate on renewable fuel production, marketing, and distribution for major airline carriers around the world. The framework agreement includes offtake and co-branded distribution agreements, as well as joint development of renewable fuel production capacity. In addition, the proposed strategic partnership seeks to promote the use of XCF's SAF within industry trade associations and OEM networks, and throughout the customer value chain.

""We are pleased to be partnering with Houston-based XCF in this exciting venture,"" said Cenan Ozmeral, President of BGN Int., LLC, based in Houston. ""BGN and XCF share a common goal to expand access to renewable fuels and accelerate the decarbonization of the aviation industry. Together, we aim to combine XCF's scalable production model with BGN's marketing and distribution network to create a seamless, efficient supply chain from feedstock to finished fuel.

""BGN's trading strength, risk management expertise, and integrated logistics network, will make SAF adoption practical and commercially viable for airlines seeking to meet tightening decarbonization targets. This is a major step, which we believe will have a significant impact on the aviation industry's ability to reduce emissions, in one of the hardest-to-abate transport sectors.""

Aligned with this partnership, BGN has joined the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the leading global trade association for the airline industry, deepening its ties with the sector and demonstrating its long-term commitment to being a top-tier supplier of SAF and renewable fuels.
