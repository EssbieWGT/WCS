Walsh blamed producers for price gouging, claiming airlines are willing to buy all available SAF even though it costs two-to-five times more than conventional fuel. IATA Chief Economist Marie Owens Thomsen added that EU and UK blending mandates have paradoxically encouraged suppliers to raise prices further.

For Switzerland—home to major corporate flyers and two globally connected hubs—the shortfall complicates sustainability strategies. SWISS and Helvetic Airways have signed multi-year SAF purchase agreements but will struggle to secure volumes if producers cannot scale up. Travel managers fear higher ticket prices or environmental-surcharge pass-throughs just as companies face tightening ESG disclosure rules.

Walsh urged governments to provide investment incentives and clearer long-term policies to de-risk refinery projects.

The SAF Act is not the only legislation introduced in recent months to reinstate the SAF bonus credit.
One provision of that bill aims to reinstate the 45Z credit premium for SAF.","Reps. Sharice Davids, D-Kan.; Mike Flood, R-Neb.; Troy Carter, D-La.; and Tracey Mann, R-Kan., on Dec. 9 introduced legislation that aims to reinstate the 45Z clean fuel production credit premium for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and extend the 45Z credit through 2033.

The original 45Z tax credit, as established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, provided a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transformation fuels. The credit started at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit was up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. Under the IRA, the 45Z credit was available for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

President Trump on July 4 signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a budget reconciliation package that extended the 45Z credit through the end of 2029, altered the credit by limiting eligibility to fuels derived from feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S., Canada or Mexico, and eliminated the “special rate” for SAF. The elimination of the “special rate” effectively caps the value of the SAF credit at $1 per gallon starting in 2026.

The SAF Act is not the only legislation introduced in recent months to reinstate the SAF bonus credit. In October, Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., introduced a bill that aims to reinstate many of the renewable energy tax credits eliminated by the OBBBA. One provision of that bill aims to reinstate the 45Z credit premium for SAF.

The bipartisan SAF Act is endorsed by major industry and agricultural groups, including National Corn Growers Association, SAF Coalition, Airlines for America, Kansas Farm Bureau, Renew Kansas, Kansas Corn, Kansas Soybean Association, Greater New Orleans Inc., Nebraska Corn Growers Association, Nebraska Soybean Association, Nebraska Farm Bureau, Twelve, Darling Ingredients, Louisiana Farm Bureau Foundation, Advanced Biofuels Association, Global Business Travel Association, and American Sugarcane League.

“The SAF Coalition applauds Reps. Sharice Davids and Mike Flood for their leadership in introducing The Securing America’s Fuels Act,” said Alison Graab, executive director, SAF Coalition. “This legislation continues the broad, bipartisan support for SAF in Congress and recognizes SAF’s unique ability to fuel America’s energy dominance while supporting American farmers. The SAF Coalition urges Congress to pass this legislation so we can grow America’s rural economies, create new markets for our farmers and secure a stronger energy future for our nation.”

“The Advanced Biofuels Association strongly supports this bipartisan effort to strengthen sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers and improve the overall availability of renewable fuels for America’s airline industry,” said Michael McAdams, president of the Advanced Biofuels Association. “This type of legislation is essential in the United States’ effort to achieve its energy dominance policy agenda.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Sharice_Davids2025_e2306b2d9d.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 21:57:13.410819

U.S. Representative Sharice Davids, along with three other lawmakers, has introduced the Securing America’s Fuels (SAF) Act. This bipartisan bill aims to strengthen the sustainable aviation fuel industry, create new opportunities for farmers, and cut emissions from transportation.

The SAF industry currently depends on the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit to stay economically viable. Although the credit was recently extended, lawmakers removed the extra incentive specifically for SAF producers. The new bill would restore that bonus credit, allowing qualifying producers to earn up to $1.75 per gallon, and it would extend the 45Z credit for all clean fuels through 2033 to give the industry more long-term stability.

Supporters say expanding SAF will benefit local communities and agriculture by creating thousands of construction, operations, and agriculture-related jobs in the coming years.

There was a great country music song in the 1980s by a guy named Johnny Lee titled “Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places.” I feel at times that could be a soundtrack for ethanol as the industry slogs its way through the mud of politics and big oil looking for love in the form of increased demand. In recent years, it has been Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and recently ethanol as a marine fuel getting attention. Both face significant challenges and at least for now may be the wrong places to look as compared to the world’s largest gasoline market right in front of us.

For starters, the push for alternatives to petroleum in both aviation and marine use markets are in large part based on reducing carbon and greenhouse gases. As I wrote about last month, during the Biden administration, reducing carbon was everything. Regulations and policy essentially dictated massive changes in our fuels and automobiles. With the Trump administration completely reversing course, beginning with their new determination that GHGs does not represent a health risk, we are witnessing the fallout from carbon-based business decisions. The auto industry is absolutely reeling, with new reports every day about layoffs and plant closures as the zero emission dreams of EVs face reality. Billions of dollars in clean energy projects have been scrapped across the country. The 45Z tax credits have yet to be finalized and only have a few years of life to begin with before expiring.

The aviation industry is on record stating subsidies and incentives are critical to SAF, and we have learned over the years the dangers of relying on subsidies that expire. As soon as the International Maritime Organization proposed carbon reducing regulations, the Trump administration threatened tariffs and other punitive measures on countries that enforced these measures. Even when carbon reduction was all the rage, Sustainable Aviation Fuels and Marine Fuels combined only represent roughly 6 percent of global GHG emissions.

Furthermore, these potential new ethanol markets like marine and aviation face stiff challenges from other technologies and fuels both from an economic and performance standpoint. In contrast, we know that ethanol stands alone as a proven additive to gasoline providing clean octane to the 270 million light-duty vehicles on the road today. E15 is a great start but to maximize that opportunity we need to be pushing for much greater blend volumes. We see in real time how 15 percent blends are reducing gas prices, an E30 blend would be twice as nice.

Lastly, and certainly not to be forgotten, is the role of ethanol in protecting public health, which despite what EPA says, is still their mission. Ethanol is and can continue to replace the carcinogenic aromatics refiners use for octane and reduce the toxic particulates that are directly tied to the family of benzene compounds. The late C. Boyden Gray was White House Counsel to President George Bush and one of the architects of the Clean Air Act. We worked closely with him on fuel provisions of that legislation and on more than one occasion when asked why he supported ethanol, Boyden would simply say, “because it saves lives!”

Again, E5 is a great step forward but with just one point of octane it falls short as a real game changer for replacing aromatics. The truly higher blends like E30 double up everything and can be utilized immediately in cars on the road today. The Department of Energy used E20 and even E30 in their testing of E15 and found no problems. The recent Nebraska demonstration of E30 is confirming that legacy vehicles can safely and efficiently use 30 percent blends. Brazil just last month formed an exploratory committee to look at blends of 35-40 percent and keep in mind there are millions non-FFVs in use there. We need to get in the game and make sure we are not selling ethanol short by limiting ourselves to E15 which, at least in terms of RVP relief, we would be by supporting current legislation. Bills in both the House and Senate must be fixed by applying the RVP waiver to all blends.

With the refiners constantly undermining the RFS and attacking ethanol, and now API reneging on their support of E15, why are we pulling our punches? Are we afraid the petroleum industry will be less helpful? The powerful grassroots voice of the ag and ethanol industries should demand the enforcement of clean octane requirements that EPA has ignored for decades. EPA and oil insist on labeling pumps with 10 percent ethanol, corn growers should launch a national labeling campaign to warn consumers that the gas they are pumping contains up to 25 percent carcinogens right next to it.

Our internal studies at CFDC make the case that if refiners basically outsourced their octane to ethanol it would dramatically free up refining capacity and allow them to process more products out of the oil barrel while capturing the margins; a win-win for everyone. While we haven’t heard much about the Trump Domestic Energy Council since they first announced it, ethanol can wrap itself in the flag and work with domestic refiners and oil interests instead of constantly battling with them.

Aviation and marine use should continue to be explored but spending a lot of time and money on them at this time when the internal combustion engine and gas-powered cars are now back in charge seems off target.

Washington, DC, Dec. 9, 2025 – The National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) today welcomed a new bipartisan bill that would restore the full value of the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) tax credit and extend the incentive for eight years.

The Securing America’s Fuels Act (SAF Act), introduced by Reps. Mike Flood (R-01-NE) and Sharice Davids (D-03-KS), follows congressional passage of legislation earlier this year that extended the 45Z tax credit but reduced its value, rendering many new SAF projects less financially feasible.

The new bill would return the credit to $1.75 per gallon and extend it through 2033 – key steps to scaling domestic production of the low-carbon fuel.

The tax credit helps close the cost gap with conventional jet fuel, enabling producers to bring more SAF to market while creating new home-grown economic opportunities for farmers, rural communities and fuel producers.

“NBAA thanks Reps. Flood and Davids for introducing this measure and understanding SAF’s economic and sustainability benefits,” said NBAA President and CEO Ed Bolen. “Restoring the full credit provides the clarity and stability needed to unlock investment, expand supply and accelerate progress toward our industry’s long-term environmental commitments.”

SAF is a drop-in jet fuel produced from bio-based feedstocks and can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over legacy fuels. The fuel is central to business aviation’s commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Beyond SAF, the business aviation community continues to drive a broad range of sustainability innovations – from operational improvements and airspace modernization to emerging propulsion technologies and hybrid-electric systems. Together with strong policy support, these initiatives form the foundation of the industry’s long-term decarbonization strategy.

- Solar Installations Peak (for Now) –

LONDON and NEW YORK and SINGAPORE, Dec. 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- S&P Global Energy today released its Top Trends report identifying the pivotal developments shaping clean energy technology, sustainability and growth in global energy markets in 2026. The report was produced by analysts of its Horizons team, which provides comprehensive energy expansion and sustainability intelligence, from big picture trends to asset level insights.

""In 2026, AI's surging power demand growth will be testing grid limits, revenue models and sustainability goals,"" said Eduard Sala de Vedruna, Vice President and Head of Research, Horizons, S&P Global Energy. ""The pace of progress will depend on unlocking new capacity and flexibility, with grid modernization a key constraint on energy security and competitiveness.""

S&P Global Energy Horizons Top Trends for 2026—tackling themes from AI's rapid growth, geopolitical realignments, and mounting climate risks—highlight how energy expansion and sustainability are necessarily interlinked.

""The interplay of AI-driven demand, grid bottlenecks, evolving procurement strategies, and rising climate risks highlights how energy expansion and sustainability are not parallel ambitions, but intertwined imperatives,"" said Leanne Todd, Senior Vice President, Global Head of Horizons, S&P Global Energy.

TOP TRENDS IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT:

As AI uptake soars in 2026, energy supply and sustainability commitments face a breaking point. S&P Global Energy Horizon's high growth view shows global datacenter power demand increasing 17% to 2026 and 14% per year through 2030, reaching potential demand of over 2,200 TWh, equivalent to India's current electricity use. This surge is testing grid limits and sustainability goals, with 38% of assessed companies with datacenter operations lacking net-zero commitments. Major tech firms including Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta are exploring new options to reconcile their power needs without compromising on their climate targets as aggregate US datacenter capital spending approaches $500 billion in 2026.

Solar growth peaks (for now): first annual slowdown in renewables additions in 2026. China's annual additions will fall from roughly 300 GW in 2025 to about 200 GW in 2026, triggered by a major policy shift from guaranteed pricing to competitive bidding. With China accounting for 50% of global additions over the past decade, this slowdown will have a deep impact. For the first time ever, new global solar installations are expected to decline year-on-year, albeit by less than 10%, as emerging markets take up some of the slack Despite this contraction, cumulative PV capacity is still expected to double over the next five years, supported by emerging markets and continued innovation, including faster deployment of battery energy storage.

Grid modernization becomes a key energy security, transition and competitiveness constraint. Decades of underinvestment have created a critical bottleneck as the world races to electrify and decarbonize. With 40% of EU grids over 40 years old, the European Commission estimates €584 billion in grid capital expenditure is needed by 2030 to support decarbonization. The US faces potential limitations on the ability to deliver needed power without investment to support explosive AI-driven datacenter growth, making grid modernization a national competitiveness issue.

Flexible Power Purchase Agreements become the new standard as price volatility reshapes how risks are managed. Increasing renewable capacity is leading to more zero- and negatively priced settlements, driving the evolution from traditional PPAs to complex hybrid structures that integrate multiple technologies and storage. The market is moving toward shorter contract terms and stronger downside protections as extreme price swings become more visible, particularly in Europe where PPA indices remain well below cost-based levels. Datacenters account for 27 gigawatts (GW), or 43% of total corporate power procurement in 2025 through October, continuing as a leading sector for clean energy procurement.

As the rest of the world slows down to consider, China gets serious about green hydrogen. Chinese projects will install about 1.5 GW of electrolyzers in 2025, nearly doubling the 1.7 GW installed globally at end-2024, with deployment projected to reach 4.5 GW in 2026. Electrolyzer stack prices have plunged from $250 per kilowatt (/kW) in early 2024 to under $100/kW due to oversupply and fierce competition. Unlike solar and batteries, Chinese firms aim to export energy as well as technology, with at least two Chinese green ammonia plants receiving EU certification for clean molecule exports, with indications of prices as low as $600 per metric ton on a free-on-board basis (FOB).

Global SAF capacity expands by one third in 2026—Asia leads, Europe pays. Global dedicated sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) capacity is expected to rise by about one third to eight million metric tons (MMt), though the speed of growth slows compared to the near doubling seen annually from 2022 to 2025. More than half of global SAF capacity will be concentrated in Asia despite modest regional demand, as producers target a European market facing supply shortfalls. Beyond 2026, capacity could increase eightfold to 42 MMt by 2030 if announced projects materialize, though only 7.3 MMt have reached final investment decision.

EV uptake continues as China has shown that EVs can be price-competitive with conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. China appears on track to become the first major ""EV majority"" market globally, with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) representing about 50% of new light vehicle sales in the first three quarters of 2025. Europe shows renewed growth due to stricter CO2 standards, while the US faces its first test of organic consumer demand without tailwinds of federal EV tax credits in 2026. Emerging markets including Thailand, Indonesia, Pakistan, Mexico, Nigeria and Malaysia are identified as relatively ripe for Chinese EV adoption.

Global trade and climate policy is increasingly focused on harmonizing emissions reporting. The EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) takes effect January 1st, 2026, requiring accountability for carbon intensity of imported goods, while major revisions are proposed for the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard. Potential proliferation of carbon border adjustment mechanisms requires companies to report different emissions to different regulators, complicating global trade. The harmonization of product-level carbon accounting is increasingly seen as prerequisite for markets to differentiate products based on carbon intensity.

China leverages global clean energy leadership and further expands influence. China has consolidated its leadership in clean energy deployment, technologies and supply chains. With overall cleantech spending growing 30% over the next five years while upstream spending is expected to remain constant, new global energy investment is shifting eastward. Meanwhile, the US is adopting a more interventionist industrial strategy, featuring greater government involvement through equity stakes and targeted support for technologies like nuclear and advanced geothermal. Diplomatically, China continues active climate participation while the US challenges multilateral efforts, creating additional space for China to expand global influence.

As emissions could drive a 2.3°C rise by 2040, adaptation shifts from optional to essential in 2026. Extreme weather and climate hazards are creating escalating risks for infrastructure, physical assets, and operations. S&P Global Energy Horizons projects annual climate-related costs of ~$885 billion for large publicly traded companies in the 2030s. Climate risk assessments and adaptation planning show patchy uptake across sectors, with an evident adaptation gap even in industries where risk assessment is more common. The increasingly urgent question is no longer whether companies will adapt, but how quickly.

,,2025-12-09 18:59:23+00:00,AeroTime,Behind business aviation's boom: Is the industry ignoring structural risks? - AeroTime,Stephen Pope,,,,,https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/business-aviation-boom-structural-risks-kevin-singh,"By almost any metric, business aviation is enjoying one of the strongest periods in its history.
In 2007 and early 2008, business aviation was also booming.
Business aviation appears healthy — maybe a little too healthy.
“When you go to the NBAA [National Business Aviation Association] events, there’s almost no talk of sustainability anymore,” he said.
Public opinion will shape aviation’s future, and if the economy weakens or the stock market turns, business aviation could again become a political target.","By almost any metric, business aviation is enjoying one of the strongest periods in its history. Manufacturers are reporting record sales, OEM backlogs in some cases stretch years into the future, and private flying remains far above pre-pandemic levels as more well-heeled travelers continue to enter the market. To many, it feels like an industry with limitless momentum.

But aviation has been in this situation before — and the warning signs of structural risks now emerging look uncomfortably familiar.

In 2007 and early 2008, business aviation was also booming. Then the financial crisis hit, and the same jets celebrated as symbols of global industrial strength became objects of political outrage. Executives abandoned their aircraft to avoid scrutiny, demand collapsed, and values cratered. The recovery took years.

The message today? Business aviation appears healthy — maybe a little too healthy.

Kevin Singh, founder and CEO of Icarus Jet, a charter and aircraft management firm with offices in Dallas, Dubai, and London, says he believes the industry may again be drifting into dangerous territory as lessons from 2008 fade. And this time, he argues, the vulnerabilities may actually run deeper.

In the aftermath of the financial crisis, Singh said, “there were guardrails to our industry. There was a respect for the crew, respect for the owner, respect for the airport, and respect for people and cities that were invested into this. There was a status quo, and today that is completely gone.”

He argues that the current boom has eroded the discipline that shaped business aviation in the years after 2008, as the cycle of greed and fear is again swinging recklessly toward excess. “Now, everybody has a private jet,” he said. “But what happened to our infrastructure in the meantime? You can’t take off from Morristown, Teterboro, White Plains, because you have two-hour delays. You can’t park in Europe because the infrastructure is bursting at its seams.”

In Singh’s view, the system was never designed to handle today’s traffic. Staffing shortages, airport congestion, and supply-chain fragility are no longer abstract concerns but real operational threats, with crews, maintenance teams, and air traffic controllers stretched to their limits.

That fragility extends to industry culture. Singh describes a marketplace where cost discipline and operational maturity have been replaced by vanity purchases, aggressive marketing, and a general erosion of responsibility.

“We went from naming and shaming people for having private jets and spray-painting their jets and yachts to ‘Look at me, I’m breaking speed records between two city pairs,’” he said. “The message is: I’m going zero to Mach 1 — and what are you going to do about it?”

Market behavior reflects the same drift. “Catering should not cost $5,000 for six sandwiches,” he said. “Somebody needs to step in and say this isn’t right.” Training costs have soared too, he said: “Fifty, sixty thousand dollars for recurrent training? We never paid more than 18 to 25. So greed has taken over. Responsibility has taken a back seat. Efficiency in this booming market is gone.”

The result, Singh said, is a “cavalier” attitude — with owners buying aircraft larger than they need because tax incentives and bragging rights shape their decisions, operators chasing sales at any cost, and an industry that has stopped explaining its value to the public.

He also worries that sustainability has nearly disappeared from industry discourse. “When you go to the NBAA [National Business Aviation Association] events, there’s almost no talk of sustainability anymore,” he said. A major private jet firm once promoted a sustainable aviation fuel message on the side of its aircraft, he noted. “Today, the pitch is that they offer a hypoallergenic mattress.”

Ignoring climate concerns, he argues, is strategically dangerous. Public opinion will shape aviation’s future, and if the economy weakens or the stock market turns, business aviation could again become a political target. “Once the tax incentive dries up or they lose Congress, there’s no longer a unified voice for our industry,” he said.

That vulnerability will only grow if the industry fails to explain its social value. “We have to make sure that we continue to educate people about why business jets exist, and that they do not take away anything from public resources,” he said.

Singh paints a stark contrast between two possible futures. One path blends better technology with real discipline and transparency. “If we use technology and AI to design better aerodynamics, better engines, emissions standards are going to be met,” he said. “Rather than, ‘Look, the Emperor is wearing the most luxurious fine linen and everybody else is hungry and poor,’ we need to create a future built on a sustainable, responsible industry.”

The darker path is what happens if nothing changes — if the boom continues on its current trajectory while airline service grows ever worse and consumer protections erode. “If we choose the other option where 500 ultra-wealthy people own 600 jets and everybody else is traveling on airlines that can’t even get them from point A to point B,” he said, “there is going to be a dangerous collective anger.” In that scenario, he warned, “five years later, we will pay those high-tier taxes for business aviation and have higher prohibition of movement of aircraft. We need be very careful.”

Singh stresses that outside scrutiny shouldn’t be seen as hostility but as a signal that the industry needs to evolve. “Engagement makes us better,” he said. “If people have questions or criticisms, we should be willing to meet them, explain what we do, and show how we’re addressing their concerns.”

For Singh, the stakes reach far beyond a temporary cooling of demand. The boom is real — but so are the structural vulnerabilities. “If we keep operating in a way that works against our own long-term interests,” he said, “costs will spiral out of control, the margins shrink, safety will suffer, and eventually the model stops working.”",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/private_jet-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 14:57:36.435275

Why is Australia Next such an important event for Tourism Australia?

It’s a signature event for us because it works and delivers great results. Last year in Cairns, we had 161 leads worth almost $170 million, and we are confident this year’s event will deliver more great results.

We know the best way to showcase our country is to show, not tell, what we have to offer. It’s an opportunity to open the eyes of both media and planners – to inspire, excite, and demonstrate the diversity of what we can do.

Every year we challenge ourselves to innovate, make it different, and worthy of the bucket-list incentive destination that we are.

What are the key developments across Australia should the MICE industry know about?

The hotel pipeline over the last few years has been phenomenal. Almost 270 new hotels have opened around the country, and around 60 to 70 per cent of those are luxury hotels so ideal for the incentive market.

Here in Melbourne, we’ve had the W Hotel and 1 Hotel brands make their debut, the first Mondrian property in Australia opened on the Gold Coast, plus lots of new Marriott hotels, and the Crystalbrook hotels in Cairns. That’s replicated in every state and city, so if you’re looking for something new, you will find it.”

Are there particular regions experiencing strong or unexpected growth?

The cities always do well for incentive groups, but some regions are really benefiting from improved accessibility and infrastructure.

Far North Queensland is performing well thanks to Singapore Airlines increasing their aircraft capacity into Cairns. Gold Coast is also seeing strong growth, as are South Australia and Perth. Perth is benefiting from the direct London–Perth flight, and in 2027 we’ll have the Sydney–London direct flights with Qantas’ Project Sunrise, which is a super exciting development.

One of our greatest strengths is how easy it is to do multi-destination programs. Our domestic aviation network is very strong and easy to navigate. Our research tells us that 38 per cent of people coming for a business event will go on to a second, if not a third destination. It comes back to Australia being a bucket list destination, and people wanting to see more and do more when they are here.”

Sustainability is a key concern for international planners. What actions is Tourism Australia taking?

We think of sustainability in the holistic sense – the environmental side, the cultural side, and the economic sustainability side. It is not a new thing for us.

We have a national sustainability to guide us, and all our own events are carbon neutral including Australia Next, but we make sure we are not just offsetting. We offset as little as possible by mitigating first.

On the aviation side, we know that people need to fly to get here, but sustainable aviation fuel is developing, and we have made a commitment to that as an industry and a government. There are also next generation aircraft coming that are greener and more sustainable.

On the ground, our product makes it easy. Many of our venues are world leading – Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre was the first in the world to receive a six-star Green Star rating – and Adelaide has a food waste system recognised as the best in the world by EarthCheck. Local hotel groups like Crystalbrook are also very sustainable.

One thing you might not know is that Tasmania is already net zero as a destination. Linking to the CSR side of sustainability, purposeful travel is key. You might be doing a citizen science project or the Reef Connect project when you are up north, which is about visiting but also educating yourself, giving back, and leaving a positive impact. They are doing amazing work.

We are also blessed with our bureaus and our DMCs. They are such high quality in what they do. They can help any planner meet their sustainability goals, and they drive the conversation because it is important to them as well.

How can planners incorporate Indigenous culture into their programs in an authentic way?

It is such an important element. We are really blessed to have the world’s oldest living culture here in Australia, and no one else can claim that. We live it as an organisation in what we do, and we share with planners how they can make it authentic and bring it into their programs.

It can be a Welcome to Country, a dot painting class, a cooking class, an arts experience, or a traditional dance. It is so varied. The soprano who performed this morning was a great example, using traditional language in her performance. There are so many ways to include it.

Education is a big part of it. The Botanic Gardens in Melbourne and Sydney have storytellers who bring traditional bush medicine to life from a tree you would normally walk past without knowing. That kind of authentic storytelling makes it very easy to immerse yourself.

If you had to give international planners three reasons why Australia should be on their destination shortlist, what would they be?

First, it is the depth and diversity we offer as a destination. That is especially important if you have repeat visits. We are very blessed with our repeat visitation. We are often seen as a bucket list destination, but then people come back, so the depth and diversity really matter.

Second, we genuinely over-deliver as a destination. Our research tells us we exceed expectations in every category. People think we are safe and secure, they expect great nature and wildlife, and food and drink are less well known, but we exceed them all.

And third, it is the Aussie welcome. That warmth is something people remember and talk about, and it really sets us apart.

What keeps Australia competitive globally?

I think the word-of-mouth element of what we can do is very powerful. We work hard to stay top of mind with media, with delegates, and with planners, and to get them here, because there is nothing like experiencing Australia firsthand. It is a hugely competitive market, but we know our campaign cuts through.

The leisure campaign you are seeing in the UK is performing in the top one percent of adverts for cut-through. Eighty-eight percent of people who see it take the next step in planning and put Australia on their consideration list. It works. We are very active in our marketing and in staying top of mind.

We also have such a strong cultural connection with the UK, and we really lean into that. It helps us stay competitive.",https://micebook.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cropped-favicon_m-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-09 17:56:44.074680

However, recent reports reveal that SAF production is not growing fast enough to meet the future needs of the aviation industry. This could have a direct impact on travelers worldwide, leading to higher costs and slower progress toward eco-friendly flights. Here’s what global travelers need to know.

The Struggle to Meet SAF Targets

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has raised concerns over the slow growth of SAF production, which is vital for achieving global aviation sustainability goals. While the production of SAF is expected to double by 2025, from 1 million tonnes to 1.9 million tonnes, the future growth looks uncertain. In 2026, production is projected to slow down, raising concerns about whether the aviation industry can meet long-term sustainability targets.

For travelers, this means that although airlines are committed to reducing their carbon footprint, it could take longer than expected to achieve the necessary fuel output. The slow pace of SAF production could also result in higher ticket prices, as the cost of SAF is currently much higher than conventional jet fuel.

The Economic Impact on Air Travel

SAF prices are substantially higher than traditional jet fuel, which presents a significant economic challenge for airlines. According to IATA, by 2025, airlines are expected to pay an additional $3.6 billion for SAF. This premium cost could be passed on to passengers, leading to higher airfare prices.

Travelers booking flights to Europe or the UK in the coming years may see this price increase reflected in their tickets, especially as policies around SAF grow more complex. For those flying from regions with strict SAF mandates, the impact may be even more pronounced, leading to additional costs and delays in the availability of greener travel options.

Europe’s SAF Mandates and Their Impact on Travelers

Europe, with its ambitious goals for reducing aviation emissions, has implemented SAF mandates to push the industry toward sustainability. However, these policies have not had the desired effect. In the European Union, the ReFuelEU initiative has increased SAF costs significantly, without a corresponding increase in production. Airlines are paying up to five times more for SAF than for traditional jet fuel, without guaranteed supply or consistent quality.

As a result, many airlines are finding it difficult to meet their SAF targets, forcing them to reconsider their sustainability goals. For travelers, this means potential flight delays and higher prices, as airlines struggle to meet demand without sufficient fuel supplies.

Looking Ahead to e-SAF: The Next Challenge for Aviation

The future of SAF could be even more complex with the looming introduction of e-SAF (electro-fuel) mandates in the UK and EU. Expected to be much more expensive than conventional jet fuel, e-SAF could be up to 12 times more costly. This will undoubtedly affect global flight prices, potentially increasing costs even further. Without strong incentives to boost e-SAF production, airlines may face steep compliance costs, with estimates suggesting an additional EUR 29 billion by 2032 if production targets are not met.

For global travelers, this means that while the promise of sustainable aviation is on the horizon, the journey will be far from smooth. Higher fuel costs could lead to more expensive flights, especially for long-haul international travel. Travelers should prepare for potential price hikes and slower transitions to more eco-friendly flying options.

What Can Travelers Expect?

As airlines struggle to balance sustainability with affordability, travelers can expect a mixed experience. The push for greener aviation is a long-term goal, but the short-term challenges are significant. High fuel prices, limited SAF availability, and policy missteps could lead to higher flight prices, especially in regions with stringent SAF mandates.

However, it’s important to note that the aviation industry is actively working toward solutions. Governments and airlines will need to collaborate on new policies that encourage SAF production while maintaining the affordability of air travel.

For now, travelers should be aware of the ongoing challenges in the aviation sector and adjust their expectations accordingly. If you’re planning to fly in the next few years, understanding how SAF production issues could affect ticket prices and availability of green flights will help you make informed decisions.

Conclusion: A Journey Toward Greener Travel

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a vital part of the future of eco-friendly air travel. However, for global travelers, it’s clear that SAF production must ramp up significantly to meet the aviation industry’s ambitious goals. The current pace of SAF production and the challenges posed by EU and UK mandates could mean higher travel costs and delays in greener flight options.

As travelers, it’s crucial to stay informed about how SAF policies and production levels might affect your future journeys. While the promise of sustainable aviation is a bright one, the path forward may be slower and more expensive than anticipated. Still, the ultimate goal of reducing aviation’s carbon footprint remains in sight, and with the right policy adjustments, we may soon be able to enjoy a more sustainable flying experience.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/5nov10.jpeg,N,,2025-12-09 13:56:16.115194

NORTH LIBERTY, Iowa, Dec. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Heartland Express, Inc. (Nasdaq: HTLD) (the “Company”) announced today that the Company plans to integrate the U.S. operations of Contract Freighters, Inc. (“CFI”) into Heartland Express, effective December 31, 2025.

The Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Mike Gerdin, commented, “We are excited to announce the integration and rebranding of the U.S. operations of CFI into Heartland Express, similar to several of our prior acquisitions. CFI Logistica, S.A, de C.V., the Company’s Mexican operations subsidiary will not be impacted. CFI’s sequential operating performance has improved during 2025, supported by the completion of our transportation management system conversion during the first quarter of 2025 and our transition to a unified driver electronic logging device and communication system with Heartland Express in the second quarter of 2025. Given this progress and the current status of our industry, we believe that integrating and rebranding CFI into Heartland Express is the next logical step in enhancing our consolidated operating and financial performance. Further, this decision was driven by a desire to align our CFI drivers’ pay package with our legacy Heartland Express pay package, providing them with an increased driver compensation and benefits package that we believe is among the best in the industry. Drivers will remain in their current trucks and have the option to choose any of the pay packages in the legacy Heartland Fleet. Drivers will also have the option to run in the other subsidiaries, Millis Transfer, LLC (Millis) or Smith Transport, LLC (Smith) fleets, within our family of brands. Customers will benefit from increased capacity within the integrated fleets, allowing us to continue to provide the committed, on-time service our customers have come to expect.”

We expect to continue to maintain current CFI offices in Joplin, Missouri (the current headquarters of CFI), as well as West Memphis, Arkansas, and Laredo, Texas. Additionally, we plan to offer all current CFI employees the opportunity to continue their employment with Heartland Express. Millis and Smith will remain in their current status.

We are currently assessing whether the integration and rebranding of CFI will have any impact on the value of the goodwill and other intangible assets associated with CFI.

Geneva, Switzerland, Dec. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

New Funding Push Accelerates Europe’s Quantum-Safe Digital Ecosystem, Develops a Sovereign Quantum Computer, and Establishes a European Quantum Corridor

SEALSQ Corp (NASDAQ: LAES) (""SEALSQ"" or ""Company""), a company that focuses on developing and selling Semiconductors, PKI, and Post-Quantum technology hardware and software products, supported by a strong liquidity position of almost $450 million, today announced its strategic decision to reinforce Europe’s leadership in Quantum Security, Post-Quantum technologies, and sovereign Quantum computing by increasing Quantum Investment Fund from $35 million to over $100 million. With this step, SEALSQ has significantly amplified its intention to drive Europe’s technological sovereignty, accelerate the rollout of a fully Quantum-Safe digital ecosystem, contribute to the development of a European sovereign Quantum Computer, establish a pan-European Quantum Corridor connecting research, industry, and secure infrastructure across the continent.

A sovereign Quantum Computer is a Quantum computing system that is designed, manufactured, operated, and secured entirely within Europe, without dependence on foreign technologies, cloud infrastructure, or supply chains. Such a system would ensure full regional control over Quantum processors, secure elements, cryptographic layers, algorithms, and data flows. Such a system could embody strategic autonomy, eliminate exposure to foreign vulnerabilities or extraterritorial regulations, preserve European intellectual property, and comply with sovereign cybersecurity and data-protection frameworks. SEALSQ believes that the development of a sovereign Quantum Computer is essential for maintaining Europe’s long-term technological independence and protecting sensitive governmental, industrial, and scientific workloads in the Quantum era.

SEALSQ’s expanded Quantum Fund is being deployed with the goal of accelerating the convergence of Quantum-resilient hardware, PQC algorithms, secure satellite and terrestrial communications, blockchain-backed identity systems, and AI-enhanced hardware security modules. SEALSQ maintains that these foundational elements are necessary not only to build a Post-Quantum secure digital ecosystem but also to create the technological infrastructure required for a sovereign Quantum Computer and a unified continental Quantum Corridor.

Several strategic investments already executed demonstrate SEALSQ’s coordinated approach and its global expansion. Specifically…

In Spain, the company, along with its parent company, WISeKey International Holding AG, (“WISeKey”) (SIX: WIHN, NASDAQ: WKEY), a leading global cybersecurity, blockchain, and IoT company, has committed approximately $12 million to develop a Post-Quantum Semiconductor Personalization and Test Center in Murcia, supported by €20 million from the Spanish government’s SETT.ES program.

In Switzerland, a $3.5 million investment in WeCan Group aims to integrate PQC-secured blockchain identity capabilities into financial and enterprise systems. SEALSQ has also deployed $10 million into WISeSat.Space with the aim to further develop its satellite constellation to deliver Post-Quantum encrypted global communications, enabling secure connectivity across the Quantum Corridor’s terrestrial and space-based nodes.

In France, the acquisition of IC’Alps for a total consideration valued at approximately $14 million enhances SEALSQ’s ability to develop custom Quantum-ready silicon optimized for algorithms such as CRYSTALS-Kyber. An investment in French startup ColibriTD brings QKD and hybrid PQC capabilities into SEALSQ’s architecture, strengthening the end-to-end secure communication needed for Europe’s Quantum future.

In USA, the company has made a strategic investment in EeroQ, a U.S.-based quantum chip design company pioneering a breakthrough approach to building a quantum computer using electrons on helium (eHe). This investment aligns with SEALSQ’s Quantum Made in USA strategy and reinforces its commitment to strengthening the United States and Europe’s leadership in quantum-resistant technologies and future quantum computing platforms.

As Quantum computing evolves, traditional encryption and legacy cybersecurity systems are expected to become vulnerable. SEALSQ’s expanded Quantum Fund plans to ensure that Europe can protect its data, communications, and digital identities against Quantum-enabled threats while laying the groundwork for a sovereign Quantum Computer and a pan-European Quantum Corridor that unites critical infrastructure, research, and industry in a secure, interoperable framework.

“This integrated strategy is not a collection of isolated technologies, it is a coordinated mission to build the world’s first fully vertically integrated quantum computing ecosystem, support the development of a sovereign European Quantum Computer, and establish a Quantum Corridor that ancors Europe’s technological future,” said Carlos Moreira, CEO of SEALSQ. “By increasing our Quantum Fund to over $100 million, we are accelerating the innovation required to protect governments, enterprises, and citizens in the Quantum era. We are building the critical infrastructure of tomorrow, today.”

With its strong liquidity, expanding technological footprint, and commitment to European digital sovereignty, SEALSQ is uniquely positioned to shape the secure Quantum future of Europe and beyond.

“The Securing America’s Fuels Act is yet another way Congress can grow our bio economy and encourage innovation that creates great jobs across rural America.
Sustainable aviation fuel will help lower emissions while expanding domestic markets for our nation’s farmers, ensuring that our ag economy thrives for generations to come.
“Sustainable aviation fuel is an exciting, new green fuel that’s creating jobs in Louisiana and driving demand for American agricultural products.
""The development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) holds great promise for Nebraska biofuels producers as well as Nebraska's farmers and ranchers,” said Mark McHargue, President, Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation.","Today, U.S. Representative Sharice Davids (D-KS-03) — alongside Representatives Mike Flood (R-NE-01), Troy Carter (D-LA-02), and Tracey Mann (R-KS-01) — introduced the Securing America’s Fuels (SAF) Act, bipartisan legislation designed to strengthen the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry, create economic opportunities for farmers, and reduce emissions in the transportation sector.

“Investing in sustainable aviation fuel isn’t just good for the environment — it’s good for Kansas farmers, our communities, and our economy,” said Davids. “The SAF Act ensures that clean fuel production incentives are strong and long-term so businesses, farmers, and innovators can plan for the future with confidence. The bipartisan support shows the incredible potential we have to build a healthier, stronger, and more prosperous future for generations to come.”

“America is on the cusp of the next great biofuels revolution,” said Representative Mike Flood (R-NE-01). “The Securing America’s Fuels Act is yet another way Congress can grow our bio economy and encourage innovation that creates great jobs across rural America. Sustainable aviation fuel will help lower emissions while expanding domestic markets for our nation’s farmers, ensuring that our ag economy thrives for generations to come. I want to thank Congresswoman Davids for introducing this much-needed bill and look forward to working together to advance this commonsense, bipartisan bill through Congress.”

The sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry currently relies on the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit to make production economically viable. While recent legislation extended the credit for all clean fuels, it eliminated the SAF-specific bonus. To address this challenge, the SAF Act would:

Reinstate the SAF bonus credit eliminated under the recent federal budget, allowing qualifying SAF producers to receive up to $0.35 or $1.75 per gallon.

Extend the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit for all clean fuels through 2033, providing long-term stability for the growing clean fuels industry.

SAF is a game-changer for local communities, agriculture, and the transportation industry. Scaling SAF to meet U.S. goals could(link is external) generate 33,000 construction jobs over five years, sustain 4,500 permanent operations jobs, and support 60,000 jobs in agriculture and logistics by 2030. SAF can also reduce(link is external) lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 percent, delivering major environmental benefits while using existing aviation infrastructure.

""Without coordinated action between government and industry, greenhouse gas emissions will continue to increase as more people and goods fly through our skies,” said Representative Troy Carter (D-LA-02). “Sustainable aviation fuel is an exciting, new green fuel that’s creating jobs in Louisiana and driving demand for American agricultural products. I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation to ensure America is on track to meet the growing demand for cleaner transportation and healthier communities.”

“Sustainable aviation fuel is a worthwhile investment for American agriculture and for American energy dominance,” said Representative Tracey Mann (R-KS-01). “The Securing America’s Fuels Act gives Kansas farmers the certainty they need to plan, invest, and keep supplying fuel to the country and our aviation sector. I will always support legislation that supports rural communities and helps the United States continue to lead the world in producing the fuels of tomorrow.”

Davids co-chairs the Congressional Sustainable Aviation Caucus (CSAC), which works to reduce the aviation industry’s environmental impact and maximize its financial sustainability. By leveraging federal policy, holding forums, and bringing together public and private partners, the caucus plays a key role in the integration of new technologies into the nation’s aviation network.

The bipartisan legislation is endorsed by major industry and agricultural groups, including National Corn Growers Association, SAF Coalition, Airlines for America, Kansas Farm Bureau, Renew Kansas, Kansas Corn, Kansas Soybean Association, Greater New Orleans Inc., Nebraska Corn Growers Association, Nebraska Soybean Association, Nebraska Farm Bureau, Twelve, Darling Ingredients, Louisiana Farm Bureau Foundation, Advanced Biofuels Association, Global Business Travel Association, and American Sugarcane League.

“The SAF Coalition applauds Reps. Sharice Davids and Mike Flood for their leadership in introducing The Securing America’s Fuels Act,” said Alison Graab,Executive Director, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Coalition. “This legislation continues the broad, bipartisan support for SAF in Congress and recognizes SAF’s unique ability to fuel America’s energy dominance while supporting American farmers. The SAF Coalition urges Congress to pass this legislation so we can grow America’s rural economies, create new markets for our farmers and secure a stronger energy future for our nation.”

“Agriculture and aviation are crucial to Kansas’ economy and Kansas Farm Bureau appreciates Rep. Sharice Davids’ leadership in introducing the Securing America’s Fuels Act alongside Rep. Tracey Mann. Incentivizing the use of domestic crops to produce sustainable fuels creates a new market for Kansas farmers while lowering the carbon emissions of the aviation industry,” said Joe Newland, President, Kansas Farm Bureau.

""The development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) holds great promise for Nebraska biofuels producers as well as Nebraska's farmers and ranchers,” said Mark McHargue, President, Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation. “We appreciate the leadership of Nebraska Congressman Mike Flood in offering this legislation that provides incentives that will help get this emerging industry off the ground. Nebraska Farm Bureau stands ready to work to get this legislation approved and help Nebraska become the SAF epicenter of the country.""

“It is crucial that Congress finds ways to support farmers with good domestic policy, at this time when international trade negotiations have left farmers in difficult market conditions,” said Richard Fotenot, President, Louisiana Farm Bureau. “Congressional policy changes can also provide relief to American consumers. The SAF Act does both. It creates consistency in domestic aviation fuel markets in a sustainable manner important to consumers. We are grateful to Congressman Carter and his colleagues for continuing to find ways to support these efforts through ideas like the SAF Act.”

“SAF may offer a great opportunity for sugarcane farmers,” said Jack Pettus, VP of Government Relations, American Sugar Cane League. “Our mills use bagasse, the fibrous byproduct of recovering sugar from the sugarcane plant, to power their operations during harvest season. Our farmers have been growing and delivering this renewable fuel for over a century and we are anxious to find new uses for the excess biofuel (bagasse) that we currently produce. The American Sugar Cane League appreciates this bipartisan effort to identify and encourage demand for domestic renewable energy feedstocks in markets like aviation fuels.”

“The Advanced Biofuels Association strongly supports this bipartisan effort to strengthen sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers and improve the overall availability of renewable fuels for America’s airline industry,” said Michael McAdams, President, Advanced Biofuels Association. “This type of legislation is essential in the United States’ effort to achieve its energy dominance policy agenda.”

“Delta applauds Reps. Flood, Davids, Mann, and Carter for their leadership in introducing the Securing America's Fuels Act, which will ensure 45Z reaches its full potential and provides the critical investment certainty necessary to bring additional SAF production facilities online to meet our industry's unprecedented demand for cost-competitive, homegrown fuels,"" said Cherie Wilson, Vice President, Government Affairs - Sustainability, Delta Air Lines.

“U.S. airlines are grateful to Representatives Flood, Davids, Carter, and Mann for introducing legislation that would restore and extend the full 45Z tax credit,” said Airlines for America. “This will stimulate private sector investment in SAF while also bolstering American energy dominance. This credit is a win-win for both the aviation and agriculture industries, supporting U.S. job growth across the country.”",http://davids.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/davids.house.gov/files/wysiwyg_uploaded/JoCo%20Airport%20taxiway%20event.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 12:57:11.731795

Le taux de croissance de la production de SAF fléchit – la reprise est essentielle à l’approche des mandats e-SAF (pdf)

Geneva – The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released new estimates for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production showing that:

In 2025, SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes (Mt) (2.4 billion liters), double the 1 Mt produced in 2024. However, in 2026, SAF production growth is projected to slow down and reach 2.4 Mt.

SAF production in 2025 represents only 0.6% of total jet fuel consumption, increasing to 0.8% the following year. At current price levels, the SAF premium translates into an additional USD 3.6 billion in fuel costs for the industry in 2025.

The estimated SAF output for 2025 of 1.9 Mt is a downward revision from IATA’s earlier forecasts due to lack of policy support to take full advantage of the installed SAF capacities. SAF prices exceed fossil-based jet fuel by a factor of two, and by up to a factor of five in mandated markets.

“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry. If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park. But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonization of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

The Negative Effects of EU & UK SAF Mandates

Mandates in the EU and UK have failed to accelerate SAF production and adoption:

In Europe, ReFuelEU Aviation has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains. Fuel suppliers have widened their profit margins to such an extent that airlines pay up to five times more than the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF. All this comes without guaranteeing supply or consistent documentation.

The UK’s SAF mandate has triggered price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the burden.

The cumulative impact of poorly designed policy frameworks is that airlines paid a premium of USD 2.9 billion for the limited 1.9 Mt of SAF available in 2025. Of this, USD 1.4 billion reflects the standard SAF price premium over conventional fuel.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production. Europe’s regulators must recognize that its approach is not working and urgently correct course. The recent European Commission STIP announcement is a step forward though it lacks a clear timeline. Actions, not words, are what matter,” said Walsh.

The failure to accelerate the expansion of SAF production capacity will cause many airlines to review their own SAF targets. “Regrettably, many airlines that have committed to use 10% SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments. SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition. These commitments were made in good faith but simply cannot be delivered,” said Walsh.

Looking Ahead to e-SAF Mandates

With e-SAF mandates approaching in the UK (2028) and EU (2030), it’s essential not to repeat the policy missteps seen with SAF.

Already, e-SAF faces a much higher cost base, potentially up to 12 times that of conventional jet fuel. Without strong production incentives (as opposed to mandates), supply will fall short of targets. On top of that, compliance costs could escalate to EUR 29 billion by 2032 if targets aren’t met, as seems very likely with the current policy framework.

“Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect. Faced with such facts, regulators must course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down. Mandates have done just the opposite, and it is outrageous to repeat the same mistakes with e-SAF mandates,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist.

Walsh noted that current fuel supply challenges and supplier pricing abuses make the industry’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 even more difficult and costly than anticipated. “We are not seeing SAF production at the volumes we had hoped and expected,” he stressed, adding that the existing regulatory framework, particularly in Europe, has proven ineffective.

All other regions, including Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, are forecast to fall short of the 5% reduction in CO₂ emissions target unless significant additional SAF capacity is developed.

IBA calculated these figures by combining ICAO’s latest SAF production capacity data with IBA’s independent global fuel demand forecasts to determine whether each region is building sufficient supply to remain aligned with a credible long-term decarbonization pathway.

IBA’s analysis shows that North America’s existing SAF capacity is slightly below the level required for 2030. Still, when factoring in facilities currently under construction, the region's capacity meets and slightly exceeds ICAO’s notional requirement. This reflects the impact of sustained policy support in the United States, including the federal SAF Grand Challenge, tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, and state-level incentives such as the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which together have helped unlock financing for a diverse range of SAF technologies.

In contrast, Europe, despite a comparatively strong project pipeline, remains below the capacity needed to hit ICAO’s 5% benchmark. While the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation sets progressively rising SAF blend levels from 2025, stringent sustainability criteria and high production costs continue to constrain supply development.

However, IBA notes that the European Commission’s newly announced Sustainable Transport Investment Plan aims to address this gap by mobilizing around €100 billion across aviation and shipping to accelerate the deployment of renewable and low-carbon fuels.

Regions including Latin America, Africa and the Middle East remain considerably behind the required levels, reflecting limited operational capacity and fewer advanced projects in the pipeline. IBA highlights that, for these regions to meet their long-term climate goals, rapid acceleration in both investment and enabling policy frameworks will be required across these markets.

Globally, SAF facilities that are operational or under construction currently equate to around 4.5% of global jet fuel supply in 2025, underscoring the significant scale-up required as the sector works toward ICAO’s 2030 milestone and the broader 2050 net-zero commitments.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/SAF_production_capacity.png,N,,2025-12-09 13:56:39.619948

In their study, Wang and colleagues developed the first quantitative online Raman spectroscopy method for β-farnesene detection during fermentation.
The ability of Raman spectroscopy to capture molecular information from aqueous samples without altering them makes it an ideal candidate for real-time bioprocess monitoring.
The team evaluated how Raman spectroscopy could rapidly quantify β-farnesene levels directly from fermentation wells, enabling high-throughput strain screening (1).
The study positions Raman spectroscopy as not merely a supplementary technique, but a central tool for future bioprocess innovation (1).","Recently, a team of researchers from Beijing University of Chemical Technology conducted a study that highlighted how in-situ Raman spectroscopy can help accelerate the development of bio-aviation fuels. This study, which was led by researcher Meng Wang of Beijing University of Chemical Technology and published in the journal Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments, demonstrated that online Raman analysis can detect β-farnesene, which is a key biofuel precursor, up to 48 times faster than conventional technologies (1).

Bio-aviation fuels are rapidly advancing because of a global push around reducing carbon emissions. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is part of this push. SAF takes renewable biomass and waste resources to use as a fuel alternative for petroleum-based jet fuels (2). Scientists have been able to achieve the performance of petroleum-based jet fuels while reducing carbon emissions (2).

The past 15 years have seen even further advancements. In 2021, the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) gave approval of the hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway in 2011 and the direct sugar to hydrocarbon (DSHC) pathway in 2014 (1). Both processes relied on efficient microbial fermentation to produce chemical intermediates such as terpenes and fatty acids (1). Despite all of this progress in fuel chemistry, the real-time monitoring of fermentation remains a major bottleneck, limiting researchers’ ability to optimize production at scale.

For the real-time monitoring of fermentation, techniques such as gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) have been used. Although GC and GC–MS provide the accuracy, they are poorly suited for rapid screening or continuous monitoring (1). That is because these methods require intensive sample preparation, are destructive to the sample, and take 20–35 minutes for each measurement (1). In fast-moving fermentation systems, where conditions can shift quickly, these delays impede process control and slow down strain screening efforts.

In their study, Wang and colleagues developed the first quantitative online Raman spectroscopy method for β-farnesene detection during fermentation. Their approach was designed to shorten the testing time from 20 minutes to just 25 seconds, removing the need for pretreatment steps (1). The ability of Raman spectroscopy to capture molecular information from aqueous samples without altering them makes it an ideal candidate for real-time bioprocess monitoring.

β-Farnesene, a well-studied sesquiterpene and an important precursor in renewable jet fuel production, served as the model compound for the study. The team evaluated how Raman spectroscopy could rapidly quantify β-farnesene levels directly from fermentation wells, enabling high-throughput strain screening (1). The experimentation included optimizing measurement distance and other key detection parameters to ensure accuracy and reproducibility (1).

A major advantage of the new system was its compatibility with 24-well fermentation plates, a standard platform for microbial screening. Instead of extracting samples and transporting them to an analytical lab, researchers can now perform direct, in-situ Raman measurements on each well. The method showed relative errors within 5% for single-phase extractant systems and within 10% when applied directly to post-fermentation wells, which are levels of precision that are considered highly reliable for rapid screening purposes (1).

What are the main takeaways from this study?

This Raman-based method enabled swift, non-destructive detection for high-throughput screening of strains producing terpenes, fatty acids, and other bio-aviation fuel precursors. This means that this technique could potentially applied to other biofuel research programs, not just aviation fuel (1). Because of the method’s success characterizing β-farnesene, the study also suggests that the in-situ Raman spectroscopy method could be applied to other compounds with chemical characteristics to β-farnesene (1).

This study paves the way for more research into sustainable aviation. Carbon-neutral fuels are becoming more pervasive because of global demand, and as a result of this trend, having a method that could evaluate microbial strains and fermentation conditions more quickly could help shorten development timelines and scale production technologies more efficiently (1). The study positions Raman spectroscopy as not merely a supplementary technique, but a central tool for future bioprocess innovation (1).

We foster a strong safety culture through comprehensive training and information sharing with the global community that operates our aircraft. Airbus actively informs stakeholders and the public about flight safety initiatives, and the Destination 10X project is a central part of this commitment.

Destination 10X is a platform dedicated to enhancing safety across the aviation industry. It does so by facilitating experience sharing and joint initiatives, fostering stronger collaboration between Airbus and its aircraft operators, and among operators themselves. This collaborative approach promotes the development of pragmatic solutions for critical safety issues. Its name comes from its objective to further reduce the current accident rate by at least a factor of 10 and even more in the future. This is our shared safety destination.

The platform organises regular regional meetings and workshops, bringing aviation safety professionals together to discuss best practices. Since 2023, eight such meetings have been held across the world. Looking ahead, an online event will gather European stakeholders in November 2025, followed by an in-person meeting for the South East Asia region in Kuala Lumpur in December 2025. These meetings lead to the production of safety promotion materials – such as comics and posters –, which are then disseminated to a broader audience through the d10x.airbus.com website.

How collaborative workshops drive safety best practices

At Destination 10X workshops, participants are split into small groups, focusing on a dedicated topic. A Middle East event in 2024 directly addressed several primary safety threats. One of the groups worked on runway incursion, assessing the associated risks, brainstorming effective mitigations and designing a storyboard for a short and comprehensive serious comics to raise awareness on this topic.Captain Anders Hedblom, Qatar Airways Airbus Fleet Safety Manager and attending this session, praised the two-day event for its innovative approach: ""Everyone is brought into the discussion, promoting ideas and learning from others”, he said.

Tackling flight safety challenges: Interference on the global navigation satellite systems

At the same event, another safety threat discussed was the interference on the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Captain Hedblom remarked: ""This is a highly relevant topic as all the Middle East carriers face this problem on a daily basis due to the proximity to multiple conflict zones. Mitigation strategies were discussed and Airbus presented future enhancements in MMR (Multi-Mode Receiver, the equipment that receives different signals including the GNSS signal) updates.""

Captain Hedblom also highlighted the high-level connection and cooperation. He shared his airline's experience of using the Flight management system Landing System (FLS), in non-precision approaches, especially in environments subject to GNSS interference. ""Representing a large airline with global operations gave me a great opportunity to share our experiences,"" he said.

Maryam Telmesani, Vice President of Sustainability at Saudia Group, said the milestone demonstrates how national targets are being translated into measurable progress.

Telmesani said Saudia is “collaborating with key partners such as Red Sea Global” to support sustainability efforts and reinforce the airline’s role in advancing environmental leadership across the Kingdom.

Aviation fuel transition gathers pace

SAF produces significantly lower lifecycle emissions compared to conventional jet fuel and is considered a key lever in aviation’s transition toward net zero.

Saudia is also exploring low carbon aviation fuel and synthetic fuel pathways as part of its wider strategy to diversify energy sources and manage greenhouse gases.

The airline said this work aligns with Saudi Arabia’s broader transport decarbonisation ambitions under Vision 2030.

RSG, which manages Red Sea International Airport, first introduced SAF into the Kingdom earlier this year.

The airport is operating on 100 percent renewable energy and is designed to support low-carbon mobility across its tourism developments.

Progress on clean mobility

Raed Albasseet, Group Chief Sustainability and Environment Officer at RSG, said that “We are proud to have been the first to introduce SAF into the Kingdom earlier this year,”

Further adding, “Saudia was the first airline to operate flights to Red Sea International Airport, and it is fitting that they are now the first to utilise our sustainable fuel supply.”

Albasseet added that the Red Sea project aims to set “a new benchmark for responsible, regenerative travel” through renewable energy integration, advanced water reuse and emission-reduction technologies.

Saudi Arabia continues to ramp up commercial deployment of new energy solutions across its aviation system, with stakeholders highlighting the importance of partnerships to scale up infrastructure, supply and operational capability.

The budget includes New Rise Reno and New Rise Reno 2.
Besides New Rise Reno 2, another project in Ft Myers, Florida, will be built on a site with access to port infrastructure.","XCF Global Inc said it had completed the initial site work for its second sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production facility, which will rise adjacent to the one it had put onstream in Storey County, Nevada, early this year.

New Rise Reno 2's 10-acre parcel has been graded and access roads have been built, according to Houston, Texas-based XCF.

""Engineering, design and project planning are underway, positioning construction to begin in 2026"", it said in a press release.

""Located adjacent to the existing New Rise Reno facility in Nevada, the new site will benefit from integration with common facilities such as gas, water, rail and personnel offices as well as existing pre-treatment, hydrogen production and broader logistics infrastructure - reducing capital costs, lowering execution risk and accelerating time to production.

""Since inception, approximately $350 million has been invested in XCF's flagship New Rise Reno facility. New Rise Reno 2 represents the next phase of this growth strategy, with an expected $300 million investment enabling XCF to double SAF production capacity to ~80 million gallons annually"".

XCF expects New Rise Reno 2 to start production 2028, along with two other SAF projects in the United States. All three have a planned nameplate capacity of 40 million gallons a year.

New Rise Reno began production in the first quarter. It has a nameplate capacity of 38 million gallons a year, according to XCF.

""The facility is designed and configured to produce 3,000 barrels per day of synthetic blending component for blending to make sustainable aviation fuel. All fuel is made from renewable triglyceride feedstocks (corn oil, soybean oil or other qualifying oils) that meet the Federal Renewable Fuels Standard"", according to the project website.

XCF chief executive Chris Cooper said, ""This expansion exemplifies how XCF grows: intentionally, efficiently and with a platform built to meet surging global demand"".

XCF noted, ""Federal targets call for three billion gallons of SAF per year by 2030 and 35 billion gallons to satisfy 100 percent of domestic demand by 2050; however, current U.S. production remains below one percent of jet fuel demand"".

""Airlines will be required to blend two percent SAF in 2025, increasing to six percent by 2030 and 20 percent by 2035, ultimately rising to 70 percent by 2050. With regional supply unable to meet these mandated volumes, Europe is expected to face structural shortages and persistently elevated SAF pricing"", it said.

""Together, the U.S. and Europe represent one of the largest and fastest-growing opportunities in the clean-energy transition, with the U.S. SAF market projected to reach nearly $7 billion by 2030 and global demand exceeding $25 billion. XCF's scalable, modular SAF platform is built to scale directly into this opportunity"".

XCF announced July 10 an investment plan of nearly $1 billion over the next three years to build SAF production facilities, with most of its in-the-pipeline projects located in the U.S. The budget includes New Rise Reno and New Rise Reno 2.

The announcement follows the completion of the merger between XCF Global Capital Inc and Focus Impact BH3 Acquisition Co, creating what they said is the first publicly traded pureplay SAF producer in the U.S.

Under its U.S. expansion plan, XCF has acquired three sites ""ready for development"", it said in an online statement July 10. The projects are planned to each have a nameplate capacity of 40 million gallons per annum. XCF expects to put them into operation by 2028.

Besides New Rise Reno 2, another project in Ft Myers, Florida, will be built on a site with access to port infrastructure.

The third will rise in Wilson, North Carolina, eyeing East Coast markets.

""These new sites are expected to replicate New Rise Reno's modular, patent-pending site design and bundled technology stack, allowing for rapid deployment, flexible production and capital-efficient scaling"", XCF said.

""Each facility is expected to have the ability to produce multiple renewable fuel products, including SAF and renewable diesel, supporting a multi-product revenue strategy that maximizes plant utilization and financial performance"".

XCF is also pursuing other ""high-potential"" markets, according to the July statement.

On October 23 it said it had signed an initial deal with New Rise Australia Pty Ltd, its joint venture with Perth-based Continual Renewable Ventures Pty Ltd, ""to accelerate the development of renewable fuel production facilities across Australia"".

""The binding term sheet grants New Rise AU an exclusive 15-year license to use the design, layout and configuration of XCF's New Rise Reno facility to build and operate at least three SAF facilities across Australia"", XCF said.

""XCF will receive a 12.5 percent equity stake, licensing fees and one board seat in New Rise AU"".

""Building on today's milestone, the parties intend to execute a definitive licensing agreement within 60 days, following customary diligence and regulatory review"", XCF said. ""The definitive agreement will include detailed provisions for intellectual property, branding, governance, performance milestones and long-term operational coordination"".

Geneva – The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released its latest financial outlook for the global airline industry showing a stabilization of profitability even as supply chain issues persist. Highlights include:

Airlines are expected to achieve a combined total net profit of $41 billion in 2026 (up from $39.5 billion in 2025). While this would set a new record, the net profit margin is expected to be unchanged from 2025 at 3.9%. Net profit per passenger transported is expected to be $7.90 (below the 2023 high of $8.50, and unchanged from 2025).

Operating profit in 2026 is expected to be $72.8 billion (up from $67.0 billion in 2025) for a net operating margin of 6.9% (improved on the 6.6% expected for 2025).

Return on invested capital (ROIC) is expected to be 6.8% (unchanged from 2025). Despite deleveraging and improved operating profitability, ROIC is expected to remain below the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) estimated to be 8.2% in 2026.

Total industry revenues are expected to reach $1.053 trillion in 2026 (up 4.5% on the $1.008 trillion expected revenues in 2025).

Load factors are forecast to continue to set record highs with airlines expected to fill 83.8% of all seats over the year 2026.

Passenger numbers are expected to reach 5.2 billion in 2026 (up 4.4% on 2025).

Cargo volumes are expected to reach 71.6 million tonnes in 2026 (up 2.4% on 2025).

“Airlines are expected to generate a 3.9% net margin and a $41 billion profit in 2026. That’s extremely welcome news considering the headwinds that the industry faces—rising costs from bottlenecks in the aerospace supply chain, geopolitical conflict, sluggish global trade, and growing regulatory burdens among them. Airlines have successfully built shock-absorbing resilience into their businesses that is delivering stable profitability,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

While strong performance of airlines in the face of a changing and challenging operating environment is impressive, the fact that the airline industry collectively does not generate earnings that cover its cost of capital remains an issue to be resolved. “Industry-level margins are still a pittance considering the value that airlines create by connecting people and economies. They stand at the core of a value chain that underpins nearly 4% of the global economy and supports 87 million jobs. Yet Apple will earn more selling an iPhone cover than the $7.90 airlines will make transporting the average passenger. And even within the air transport value chain, airline margins are totally out of balance, particularly when compared to margins of engine and avionics manufacturers and many of our service suppliers. Imagine the additional power that airlines could bring to economies if we could re-balance value chain profitability, reduce regulatory and tax burdens, and alleviate infrastructure inefficiencies,” said Walsh.

Air cargo’s performance is of particular interest as it has defied many predictions of gloom to hold its own amid rapidly changing trading conditions. “The resilience in air cargo has been particularly impressive. As trade flows adapt to a protectionist US tariff regime, air cargo has been the hero of global trade buoyed in part by robust e-commerce and semiconductor shipments to support the boom in AI investments. Notably, air cargo enabled front-loading to deliver products ahead of tariff deadlines, and it flexibly accommodated demand surges as tariffed goods normally destined for the US found new markets. The critical role of air cargo is front and center as the global economy adjusts to new realities,” said Walsh.

Outlook Drivers

Overall revenues are expected to grow by 4.5% to $1.053 trillion. This is expected to outpace operating expense growth of 4.2% to $981 billion, leading to a $1.5 billion improvement in industry-wide net profitability in 2026.

Macro-economic factors impacting airlines are mixed for 2026. On the positive side, GDP growth is expected to be largely stable at 3.1% and inflation is expected to ease slightly to 3.7%. World trade growth is, however, expected to be anemic at 0.5%.

Revenue

Passenger ticket revenues are expected to reach $751 billion in 2026 (+4.8% on $716 billion in 2025). This growth will be primarily driven by a 4.9% expansion of industry-wide revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) expected in 2026. Yields are expected to remain relatively flat while the passenger load factor is expected to set a new record at 83.8% as new aircraft remain in short supply.

Ancillary and other revenues are projected to rise by 5.5%, reaching $145 billion. Ancillary services now account for nearly 14% of total revenue, up from 12-13% pre-pandemic.

Cargo revenue is forecast to reach $158 billion in 2026 (+2.1% on $155 billion in 2025). This moderate expansion is driven by continued growth in cargo, particularly in time-sensitive shipments and e-commerce volumes (+2.6% growth in cargo tonne kilometers or CTK in 2026, slowing from +3.1% growth in 2025). Coupling these factors with tightening capacity, cargo yields are expected to remain stable (-0.5% on 2025) and elevated (approximately 30% above pre-pandemic levels), despite a broader slowdown in global trade.

Costs

Overall, the 2026 cost outlook points to a more balanced environment. Fuel relief is offset by rising non-fuel pressures, but the broader slowdown in inflation is helping to stabilize the cost base.

Fuel costs are expected to decline slightly to $252 billion in 2026 (-0.3% from $253 billion in 2025). The consensus forecast is for crude oil prices to decline to $62/barrel Brent (-11.0% on $70/barrel in 2025). Jet fuel prices are only expected to decline by 2.4% from $90/barrel in 2025 to $88/barrel in 2026 as the crack spread widens. The expiration of higher-cost hedges from 2025 should allow airlines to realize lower average prices that are closer to market levels. Fuel is set to account for 25.7% of total operating expenses, down from 26.8% in 2025.

Fuel efficiency gains are expected to be just 1.0% as supply chain issues continue to hamper fleet renewal and push the average aircraft age to over 15 years, the highest ever. Factoring in industry growth, fuel consumption is expected to increase to 106 billion gallons in 2026 (+2.7% on 103 billion gallons in 2025).

The cost of compliance with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) is expected to grow to $1.7 billion for 2026 (up from $1.3 billion for 2025).

The incremental cost of airline purchases of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is expected to reach $4.5 billion in 2026, with the expectation of 2.4 million tonnes of SAF being available (0.8% of total fuel consumption).

Non-fuel costs are forecast to be $729 billion (+5.8% on $689 billion in 2025). Labor costs are now the largest cost component (28%) as wage growth continues to outpace inflation amid very tight labor market conditions. Despite strong hiring, the airline industry has struggled to restore employment productivity to 2019 levels, as rapid workforce growth has outpaced gains in output per employee amid ongoing operational and training challenges.

Maintenance costs are climbing due to the aging fleet and supply chain disruptions that affect the availability of parts. Lease rates have reached record highs, pushing up ownership costs. Airport and en-route charges continue to rise as well.

A weaker US dollar is expected to benefit non-USD-based airlines’ profitability and margins by reducing US dollar-denominated costs such as fuel, aircraft leases, and maintenance. IATA estimates that 55–60% of global airline costs are denominated in USD, compared to 50–55% on the revenue side. Based on this, a 1% weakening of the USD against global currencies may lift global airline profits by 1% and improve operating margins by around 0.05 ppt.

Risks, Constraints, and Opportunities

Supply chain challenges continue to constrain airlines’ ability to meet consumer demand for air transport. While some improvements are expected in 2026, the backlog in aircraft orders is expected to continue to grow. High load factors and yield stability are partially attributable to supply chain issues. However, the growth-constraining impact of supply chain challenges remains a drag on airline profitability. Even as aircraft deliveries are projected to increase significantly in 2026, the pace of new orders is outstripping production, causing the backlog to reach new highs and signaling that supply constraints, and their financial impact, will persist well beyond the near term.

The regulatory cost burden on airlines is significant. While significant deregulation is being pursued in the US, European regulators have yet to act on the recommendations of the Draghi report to make significant improvements in competitiveness by easing regulatory burdens. A case in point is the attempt to reform the European regulation on passenger rights (EU261), which has been watered down in ambition and convoluted with proposals to essentially make cabin baggage a passenger right irrespective of an airline’s business model or customer need.

Infrastructure constraints are not expected to ease significantly in 2026. However, US plans to renew its air traffic management system in the coming years would be a major improvement. While regulators have reaffirmed International Civil Aviation Organization principles for infrastructure charges, most have failed to use the principles to realize cost efficiencies. A case in point is London’s Heathrow Airport where the potential cost of expansion plans could render the airport uncompetitive without significant reforms.

Conflict continues to hamper airlines with significant costs. Airspace closures, GNSS interference, and re-routing for both political and safety reasons are constraining operations and reducing efficiencies.

Low GDP per capita across much of the continent limits discretionary spending, making air travel highly price sensitive and restricting its growth potential. Demand is further constrained by visa restrictions, restrictive bilateral agreements, and high passenger charges. Moreover, African carriers face the highest unit costs globally, with average cost per ATK near 140 US cents, almost double the industry average. Among the many factors contributing to the high cost of operations in Africa are high fuel costs, fragmented markets, older fleets, and average corporate tax rates of 28% (the highest among all regions).

Until these constraints ease, Africa’s airline industry will operate with thin margins and limited resilience, even as traffic expands faster than the global average.

Passenger demand remains robust, with China and India leading regional expansion, driven by rising tourism activity and the growing middle classes. Easing visa requirements for Chinese group tours to South Korea and for visitors to China are expected to stimulate short-term inbound demand, particularly during peak holiday periods.

Overcapacity remains a challenge amid a slower recovery in international traffic putting pressure on yields. Deflationary pressures are also driving yields lower in China. Nevertheless, Asia Pacific remains the largest contributor to global traffic growth, with load factors projected to reach 84.4% in 2026, an all-time high for the region.

While Chinese exports to the US have declined, substitution effects have helped offset the impact of trade tensions, as Chinese goods have found alternative markets.

Europe is projected to deliver the strongest financial performance in absolute terms among all regions. European airlines show disciplined capacity management and strong load factors. Low-cost carriers are performing particularly well, expanding at double-digit rates and outperforming full-service carriers on net profit margin, fueled by strong intra-European traffic and leisure market. Traffic growth is moderating as the market matures and amid tepid economic conditions in the Euro zone where GDP growth lags the global average.

On the cost side, the strength of the Euro has provided a partial offset to inflationary pressures, particularly in fuel and leasing expenses, helping carriers maintain margins despite volatility in input costs.

The regulatory cost burden is increasing with the ReFuelEU initiative requiring a 2% SAF blend at EU airports from 2025. This coincides with mounting operational headwinds: labor unrest, drone disruptions, and persistent air traffic control bottlenecks.

Traffic growth remains robust driven by economic stability and enhanced intra-regional connectivity. Demand between the Americas has softened, though this has been offset by increased regional flows and a solid transatlantic performance, highlighting the adaptability of carriers in the face of shifting travel patterns.

Operating profitability is anticipated to rebound again in 2026, benefiting from the gradual strengthening of the region’s fundamentals. However, currency fluctuations remain a critical headwind. Although 2025 saw temporary relief with local currencies appreciating, volatility is expected to continue to challenge cost management and profitability.

With several major carriers in the region realizing the benefits of Chapter 11 restructuring, the region’s environment has shifted from crisis-driven survival to cautious, efficiency-focused rebuilding.

The Middle East is the strongest region in terms of net profit margin and profit per passenger. This performance attests to the difference a positive regulatory operating environment can make, and to the region’s strategic position as a global connecting hub.

Passenger demand continues to be robust, driven by long-haul traffic and the expansion of hub carriers. Governments and airlines are doubling down on infrastructure investments to secure long-term growth. While geopolitical tensions remain a feature of the regional landscape, they are not expected to negatively impact growth, particularly as efforts to secure lasting peace continue.

Middle Eastern carriers are mitigating aircraft delivery delays through retrofit programs and fleet life extensions, though capacity growth will remain constrained in the near term.

North American profitability remains stable, but the region ceded its most profitable ranking to Europe in 2025.

The United States suffered stagnating overall growth and a domestic market contraction in the face of policy uncertainty around tariffs, tighter immigration enforcement dampening both inbound and domestic travel, and a lengthy government shutdown. Capacity constraints, pilot shortages, engine reliability issues, and rising labor costs continue to restrict expansion. Despite these hurdles, airlines managed to protect margins in 2025, supported by stable yields and lower fuel prices. Performance, however, varies by business model. Low-cost carriers are under pressure, heavily exposed to the shrinking US domestic segment, growing passenger preferences for premium services, and facing the disadvantages of single-type fleets amid supply chain disruptions.

Looking ahead, 2026 is expected to see some easing of these challenges and the opportunity for a gradual increase in demand.

Travelers’ Viewpoint

Air travel continues to deliver exceptional value to consumers. Average real return air fares in 2025 US dollars were 34.7% cheaper compared to 2015. And passengers are expected to benefit from efficiency gains and competitive forces that will likely see 2026 average return air fares at 36.8% below 2015 level.

An IATA public opinion poll conducted in October-November 2025 (14 countries, 6,500 respondents who have taken at least one trip in the last year) revealed that 97% of travelers expressed satisfaction with their last travel experience. Moreover, 88% agreed that air travel makes their lives better, 78% agreed that air travel is good value for money, and 87% said they cared about their ability to fly in future.

Passengers are counting on a safe, sustainable, efficient, and profitable airline industry. The IATA public opinion polling demonstrated the important role that travelers see the airline industry playing:

90% agreed that air connectivity is critical to the economy

88% said that air travel has a positive impact on societies, and

82% said that the global air transport network is a key contributor to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

83% care about the success of the aviation industry

The air transport industry is committed to its goal of achieving net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. Travelers are expressing high levels of confidence in this endeavor with 79% agreeing that the industry is demonstrating commitment to work together to achieve its ambitious goal, 77% agreeing that aviation leaders are taking the climate challenge seriously.

Newland highlighted the importance of backup power systems, especially during extreme weather. He emphasized the vulnerability of the current electrical grid, noting, “Our grid is probably more vulnerable today than it has been in a long time, and that’s due to power plants, the old ones, coming offline, and all the AI technology that’s coming online.” He explained that propane-powered generators can either supplement existing systems or fully power a farm continuously, ensuring that critical operations remain functional during outages. Newland also references the Department of Energy’s resource adequacy report, which he encourages producers to read.

Addressing financial considerations for growers, Newland described incentive programs available to support the transition to propane-powered equipment. He said, “Anybody that’s investing in propane powered equipment around the farm, we have a very unique program…farmers can get a rebate from us up to $10,000 when they purchase propane powered equipment.” He also recommended exploring national grant programs such as USDA’s REAP and EQUIP programs, which could potentially provide additional funding alongside the propane-specific rebate.

On the topic of propane accessibility and reliability, Newland reassured rural producers that supply is robust, noting, “We’ve got, gosh, roughly 3,000 companies selling propane around the country. We’ve got a lot of fuel.” He discussed advances in renewable propane, produced as a byproduct of sustainable aviation fuel, which has “a much lower carbon intensity score” than conventional propane, highlighting the fuel’s clean-burning qualities and its potential for future sustainability improvements.

Newland also touched on innovations in propane-powered agricultural equipment and technology. He described how propane is used in various new applications, saying, “So we’re killing weeds with propane. Classifies as organic pre plant, and then in crop as well. We’ve got a product out in California. We’re injecting steam prior to vegetables being planted, and then that same technology is going to be tested on strawberry production here very soon as well.” These examples illustrate ongoing efforts to expand propane’s versatility in agriculture beyond heating and drying.

Finally, Newland hinted at future developments in mobile and automated solutions, signaling ongoing innovation in propane technology for farms. He expressed optimism about the potential impact of these projects: “We’re always looking for new opportunities. We’re having some mobile ag discussions as well, and we’ll talk more about those hopefully in the coming years, as we get those projects up and get them running.” His comments reflect both the current utility of propane in farming and the sector’s evolving focus on efficiency, sustainability, and advanced automation.",,N,,2025-12-09 09:56:41.026604

This research marks a major step forward in understanding how different aviation fuels change the impact of flying on air quality and the climate.

We spoke to the research team:

We recently performed engine tests on a static engine stand, and used specialist sampling probes to monitor non-CO2 emissions from the jet engine running on different fuels.

This is part of a pioneering project called GRIM-SAF (GRound-Based and Inflight Measurements), which is investigating how sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could reduce aircraft emissions of soot and volatile particles, and a range of gases including nitrogen oxides, often referred to as the non-carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

– Dr Ruth Purvis, research scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and University of York

“We often talk about the environmental impact of air travel in terms of the carbon dioxide emissions produced, but this is just one part of the picture. Effective Radiative Forcing (ERF) is a measure of a particular pollutant or sector’s impact on climate. Non-CO2 emissions can contribute up to 66% of aviation’s ERF, compared with 33% from CO2. Additionally, it’s important to understand what effects they have on our local air quality around airports,” explains Dr Paul I Williams, senior research scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and University of Manchester and project lead for GRIM-SAF.

Emissions from aircraft aren’t just limited to the skies; ultrafine particles have been detected many kilometres downwind of airports at ground level, especially major airports that see heavy air traffic. Increased particulate matter (PM) concentrations in the air is a sign of poor air quality, which can be harmful for people living in these locations.

Burning SAF in jet engines still generates air pollution that affects public health, particularly on the ground during idle and taxi when fuel is being burned somewhat inefficiently. If aviation volumes increase in the UK, fuelled by SAF, there will be noise and air quality impacts that need considering alongside greenhouse gas emissions.

– Professor Ally Lewis, research scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and University of York

“This amazing experiment, funded by NERC and the Department for Transport, is making new measurements that will shed some light on the air quality impacts of burning SAF in jet engines. It was coordinated by Dr Andrew Crayford and Dr Eliot Durand at Cardiff University, as well as Dr Paul Williams and Dr Ruth Purvis at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science.

“Some newly built instruments have been used, including a 60 second cycle-time Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer for Volatile Organic Compounds designed by Dr Steve Andrews, and a super high precision sulfur dioxide monitor from Peter Edwards’ group – both developed at the University of York.

“Sulfur dioxide and black soot emissions will likely be lower when adding SAF, but it’s not yet clear what will happen to NOx or other less talked about air pollutants such as benzene, formaldehyde or ultrafine particles,” says Professor Ally Lewis, research scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and University of York.

Nitrogen oxides, known as NOx, are significant contributors to air pollution, impacting air quality and affecting our climate. The majority of NOx emissions presently come from cars and HGVs, but as electric cars become more widespread the aviation sector will become responsible for a larger share of this.

Production of SAF doubled between 2024 and 2025 but has not grown at the same rate since. Volumes did not reach the levels that stakeholders had anticipated. Commitments made in 2015 aimed for increases, but progress stalled.

Willie Walsh told the end of year media briefing by IATA in Geneva that airlines had committed to targets such as 10% sustainable aviation fuel usage by 2030. These goals proved difficult to achieve due to limited availability rather than cost issues. Airlines entered these commitments with expectations of greater supply, but shortages forced reevaluations.

He saidegulatory frameworks, particularly in Europe, contributed to this situation by imposing measures that raised costs for airlines. Suppliers implemented compliance fees that elevated fuel prices, affecting the sector’s ability to meet obligations.

He namechecked New Zealand for confronting reality and suspending its targets, highlightiing the broader challenges in the SAF supply chain.

Production continued at current levels without corresponding expansions in infrastructure or policy support. The introduction of mandates has led to suppliers charging additional fees, which airlines viewed as exploitation of their market position. This dynamic protected supplier profits while failing to deliver the required fuel volumes. Airlines struggled to acquire the necessary amounts to fulfill their pledges.

Non-financial measures are a focus as obligations increase into 2026. The failure of the supply side prompted more carriers to assess the feasibility of their earlier targets. Regulators observed these developments without intervening, allowing the price increases to persist. This lack of action compounded the difficulties for the industry.

Key takeaways include the need for improved regulatory frameworks to boost production, the importance of addressing supply shortages to meet commitments, and the call to hold suppliers accountable for fee structures. The sector requires coordinated efforts to prevent further reevaluations of sustainability goals.

Mr Walsh shared: “I’m disappointed that the piece of progress and there are some worrying developments that we witness during 2025.”

“This is a great disappointment a couple of airlines who have committed to high levels of SAF in 2013 made 10pc by 2030 I believe be challenging for the industry to achieve.”",https://www.travelextra.ie/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/willie-walsh-of-IATA-853x1024.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 11:57:41.635918

“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry.
The failure to accelerate the expansion of SAF production capacity will cause many airlines to review their own SAF targets.
“Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect.
Faced with such facts, regulators must course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released new estimates for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production showing that:

In 2025, SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes (MMt) (2.4 billion liters), double the 1 MMt produced in 2024. However, in 2026, SAF production growth is projected to slow down and reach 2.4 MMt.

SAF production in 2025 represents only 0.6% of total jet fuel consumption, increasing to 0.8% the following year. At current price levels, the SAF premium translates into an additional USD 3.6 billion in fuel costs for the industry in 2025.

The estimated SAF output for 2025 of 1.9 Mt is a downward revision from IATA’s earlier forecasts due to lack of policy support to take full advantage of the installed SAF capacities. SAF prices exceed fossil-based jet fuel by a factor of two, and by up to a factor of five in mandated markets.

“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry. If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park. But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonization of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

The Negative Effects of EU & UK SAF Mandates. Mandates in the EU and UK have failed to accelerate SAF production and adoption:

In Europe, ReFuelEU Aviation has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains. Fuel suppliers have widened their profit margins to such an extent that airlines pay up to five times more than the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF. All this comes without guaranteeing supply or consistent documentation.

The UK’s SAF mandate has triggered price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the burden.

The cumulative impact of poorly designed policy frameworks is that airlines paid a premium of USD 2.9 billion for the limited 1.9 MMt of SAF available in 2025. Of this, $1.4 billion reflects the standard SAF price premium over conventional fuel.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production. Europe’s regulators must recognize that its approach is not working and urgently correct course. The recent European Commission STIP announcement is a step forward though it lacks a clear timeline. Actions, not words, are what matter,” said Walsh.

The failure to accelerate the expansion of SAF production capacity will cause many airlines to review their own SAF targets. “Regrettably, many airlines that have committed to use 10% SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments. SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition. These commitments were made in good faith but simply cannot be delivered,” said Walsh.

Looking Ahead to e-SAF Mandates. With e-SAF mandates approaching in the UK (2028) and EU (2030), it’s essential not to repeat the policy missteps seen with SAF.

Already, e-SAF faces a much higher cost base, potentially up to 12 times that of conventional jet fuel. Without strong production incentives (as opposed to mandates), supply will fall short of targets. On top of that, compliance costs could escalate to EUR 29 billion by 2032 if targets aren’t met, as seems very likely with the current policy framework.

“Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect. Faced with such facts, regulators must course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down. Mandates have done just the opposite, and it is outrageous to repeat the same mistakes with e-SAF mandates,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist.

By 2050, when the aviation sector must reach net-zero emissions, Mexico is expected to produce only 3% of the region’s SAF. “SAF is an alternative, but not the only one, and even if we operated entirely with SAF, it is not perfect from an emissions standpoint,” said Roberto Alvo, ALTA chair and CEO, LATAM Airlines. He emphasized that SAF requires long-term, complex investment and should not be treated as the sector’s sole decarbonization tool.

Global carriers have committed to carbon-neutral operations by 2050, requiring fleet modernization, broad SAF integration, and operational efficiency gains. Brazil has introduced the region’s first mandate—requiring airlines to use at least 1% SAF by 2027—though the country does not yet produce the fuel. Industry leaders caution that such measures could raise fares. “In the end, the customer pays the cost,” said SKY Airlines President Holger Paulmann.

ALTA estimates that SAF-related cost increases could be significant. Citing the Air Transport Action Group’s Waypoint analysis, the organization warns of a US$318 billion burden for Latin America and the Caribbean. Copa Airlines CEO Pedro Heilbron stressed that responsibility cannot fall solely on carriers. “Aviation carries that burden, but airlines have the least influence. We do not produce oil, regulate, or finance. This requires joint effort,” he said.

About 75% of aviation’s long-term emissions-reduction potential depends on scaling SAF. Another 20% could come from new technologies, infrastructure upgrades, and fleet renewal. With Latin America operating one of the world’s youngest aircraft fleets—averaging 10.5 years, compared with 16.7 in the United States and 13.5 in the European Union—the region still holds substantial decarbonization potential. “Airlines in our region have worked to maintain newer fleets to achieve lower emissions,” said Estuardo Ortíz, CEO, JetSMART.

Despite the challenges, a 2025 MIT study highlights the emissions gains possible from SAF adoption. Funded by LATAM Airlines Group and Airbus, the analysis finds that aviation emissions in Latin America could fall by up to 60% by 2050 if SAF reaches 65% of total fuel use and is paired with efficiency improvements and supportive policies.

However, the report underscores that costs remain the main barrier. Conventional jet fuel in Latin America averages US$0.70 per liter, while SAF ranges from US$1.11 to US$2.86 per liter, depending on feedstock and production pathway. Because fuel represents more than 40% of airlines’ operating costs, this price gap poses risks to fares, demand, and profitability.

MIT researchers outline several strategies to narrow the cost gap. One option is deeper regional economic integration: countries with stronger SAF feedstock potential—Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru—could supply nations with limited capacity, such as Chile and Mexico. The study estimates such coordination could reduce market disruption by up to 40%. It also identifies feedstocks with strong scalability potential, including ethanol from sugarcane and corn, and HEFA fuels derived from palm or soybean oil. Meeting projected SAF demand, however, will require an estimated US$204 billion in regional production-facility investment through 2050.

Stronger government action will be essential for SAF competitiveness. According to the report, policy tools—including carbon pricing, blending mandates, feedstock certification, and tax incentives—could accelerate adoption. Researchers point to the US 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit, which offers US$0.75–US$1.75 per gallon, as an effective model.

“SAF is a promising decarbonization pathway, but it must be combined with an economy-wide emissions mitigation policy that uses market-based mechanisms to offset the remaining emissions,” said MIT researcher Sergey Paltsev.

LATAM Airlines Group Director of Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Juan José Tohá stressed that the region cannot meet its climate goals without SAF. “We must chart the right path to reduce the risk of rising costs and avoid compromising regional connectivity,” he said. “Regional integration is a key alternative to limit cost overruns and ensure the transition toward more sustainable aviation.”",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-12/pexels-pixabay-62623.jpg?h=32973ddf&itok=OI3X_yDA,N,,2025-12-09 09:57:03.367104

Abu Dhabi Advances Circular, Low-Carbon Aviation with First Commercial-Scale Waste-to-SAF Project

A Continental Push for Energy Efficiency

At the heart of the AU’s strategy is a major drive to improve energy efficiency across industrial, commercial, transport, and residential sectors.

African states are being encouraged to adopt stronger energy-performance standards, digitize power systems, modernize grids, and transition large-scale operations toward low-waste, high-efficiency models.

This is particularly significant for fast-growing economies where demand for power is rising sharply. Enhanced energy productivity will help reduce strain on national grids, cut greenhouse gas emissions, and lower energy costs for businesses and households.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Becomes a Priority

A major highlight of the AU’s strategy is Africa’s bold commitment to developing local supply chains for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Low-Carbon Aviation Fuel (LCAF).

This move aims to give the continent a leadership position in the global aviation decarbonization race, especially as airlines worldwide face increasing pressure to meet net-zero aviation goals.

With vast biomass resources, emerging biofuel innovators, and growing airport infrastructure, Africa has the potential to become a key SAF producer and exporter.

The strategy encourages member states to:

Build regional refineries and bioprocessing hubs

Develop supportive policies and incentives

Foster public-private partnerships with airlines and energy companies

Invest in research and innovation for next-gen aviation fuels

Smart Infrastructure for a Low-Carbon Future

Beyond fuels and energy systems, the AU’s framework emphasizes smarter, climate-resilient infrastructure. This includes digitalized transport networks, energy-efficient buildings, and adaptive urban planning capable of supporting Africa’s rapidly expanding cities.

Smart infrastructure will play a crucial role in helping African nations withstand climate impacts while unlocking new growth opportunities through green industries, manufacturing, and clean mobility.

Aligning with Agenda 2063

The AU’s new energy and aviation policies directly support the continent’s long-term development blueprint — Agenda 2063. By prioritizing sustainability, innovation, and low-carbon development, the strategy positions Africa to attract global climate finance, strengthen regional trade, and advance the transition to a modern clean-energy economy.

Conclusion: A Unified Continental Leap Toward Sustainability

Africa’s endorsement of energy-efficiency reforms, sustainable aviation fuels, and climate-smart infrastructure marks a major turning point in its green transition journey.

With coordinated regional action and a future-focused policy framework, the continent is not only addressing climate challenges but also positioning itself as a competitive force in the global green economy.

Traditionally, B2B logistics focused on securing the best value, but in recent years sustainability has become a leading factor.
The demand for transparency According to DHL, only 53% of B2B customers are satisfied with the current level of transparency in their supply chains.
“It’s crucial for businesses to be sincere and transparent about their efforts,” says Katharina Tomoff, Senior Vice President for Global ESG at DHL Supply Chain.
“E-commerce is evolving – from AI-driven personalisation and social commerce to the rise of B2B and borderless trade,” says Pablo Ciano, Chief Executive Officer at DHL ecommerce.","Sustainability is now a central part of many businesses, as many integrate ESG measures into their wider operational strategy.

This is not just about environmental responsibility, but also about ensuring B2B deliveries are cleaner, more efficient and more cost-effective.

Traditionally, B2B logistics focused on securing the best value, but in recent years sustainability has become a leading factor.

As a result, emissions tracking across Scope 1, 2 and 3 has moved into focus. Businesses are now expected to provide detailed emissions data and prove they are taking steps to decarbonise their supply chains if they want to work with them, making informed supply chain decisions essential.

The demand for transparency

According to DHL, only 53% of B2B customers are satisfied with the current level of transparency in their supply chains.

Although, initial costs may be higher, sustainable shipping can reduce expenses over time, particularly through lower fuel consumption achieved through energy-efficient transport.

“It’s crucial for businesses to be sincere and transparent about their efforts,” says Katharina Tomoff, Senior Vice President for Global ESG at DHL Supply Chain.

“Customers want to see a genuine commitment to sustainability.”

The B2C influence

The B2C sector has long understood the importance of a seamless customer journey, with consumers expecting speed, convenience and sustainability.

Now, B2B organisations are catching up, recognising that their clients are also consumers in their personal lives and bring those same expectations to their professional roles.

“E-commerce is evolving – from AI-driven personalisation and social commerce to the rise of B2B and borderless trade,” says Pablo Ciano, Chief Executive Officer at DHL ecommerce.

“Businesses are scaling faster and reaching further than ever before, so it’s vital to have logistics partners that can offer scalable, sustainable solutions.”

Sustainable solutions

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is one such solution, produced from renewable sources like vegetable oils and waste products, SAF can reduce GHG emissions by up to 80%.

By shifting focus to electric vehicles, businesses could reduce carbon from final-mile deliveries.

To ensure progress, businesses must measure emissions and report on their sustainability performance.

This allows them to identify areas for improvement and promote their progress on sustainability metrics, making them a more appealing choice for clients.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/176f28b608485324109551e457f7fa87:e6e6b1a433243f50cd30cfb12ff7a412/dhl-b2b-sustainable-shipping-pc.webp.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 09:57:18.687030

London, UK – 8th, December, 2025: Rolls-Royce, easyJet, Heathrow and University College London Air Transportation Systems Lab (UCL ATSLab) published a report highlighting how hydrogen-powered aircraft could enable European and UK aviation to cut carbon emissions while supporting future growth.

The study, Enabling Hydrogen in the European Aviation Market, found that hydrogen in aviation offers a unique opportunity to achieve both emissions reduction and market expansion. The analysis shows that introducing hydrogen alongside Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) can accelerate progress towards net zero, particularly when policy incentives reward low-carbon fuels and if hydrogen were to be included within the EU’s SAF mandate1.

The research also found that targeted hydrogen infrastructure at around 20 major European airports, including Heathrow, could deliver more than 80% of the emissions benefits of full hydrogen availability across the continent. Concentrating investment at key ‘hydrogen hubs’ would therefore provide a practical and cost-effective path to early adoption.

Further modelling indicates that the earlier novel technologies, such as hydrogen, can be introduced, the more opportunity they present for CO2 emission reductions, underscoring the value of early technological transition where it is financially and technically viable.

The study is underpinned by UCL ATSLab’s Airline Behaviour Model (ABM), which represents the complexity of airline decision-making through specific behavioural variables. Building on this, the research evaluates how fuel costs, incentives and new technologies shape airline responses.

North America on track for ICAO’s 2030 cleaner-energy target as other regions lag

IBA, the aviation market intelligence and advisory company, reports that North America is currently the only global region on track to meet the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO) cleaner-energy goal for 2030: a 5% reduction in CO₂ emissions from international aviation through the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other clean energy sources.

All other regions, including Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, are forecast to fall short of the 5% CO₂ reduction target unless substantial additional SAF capacity is developed.

IBA calculated these figures by combining ICAO’s latest SAF production capacity data with its own independent global fuel demand forecasts to assess whether each region is developing sufficient supply to remain aligned with a credible long-term decarbonisation pathway. The analysis shows that North America’s existing SAF capacity is slightly below the level required for 2030, but when including facilities currently under construction, the region’s capacity meets and slightly exceeds ICAO’s notional requirement. This reflects the impact of sustained policy support in the United States, including the federal SAF Grand Challenge, tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, and state-level measures such as the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which together have helped unlock financing for a diverse range of SAF technologies.

In contrast, Europe, despite a comparatively strong project pipeline, remains below the capacity needed to achieve ICAO’s 5% benchmark. Although the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation sets progressively rising SAF blend levels from 2025, stringent sustainability criteria and high production costs continue to limit supply growth.

However, IBA notes that the European Commission’s newly announced Sustainable Transport Investment Plan aims to address this shortfall by mobilising around €100 billion across aviation and shipping to accelerate the deployment of renewable and low-carbon fuels.

Regions including Latin America, Africa and the Middle East remain significantly behind the required levels, reflecting limited operational capacity and fewer advanced projects under development. IBA highlights that, for these regions to meet their long-term climate goals, rapid acceleration in investment and enabling policy frameworks will be necessary.

Globally, SAF facilities that are operational or under construction currently represent around 4.5% of global jet fuel supply in 2025, underscoring the substantial scale-up required as the sector works towards ICAO’s 2030 milestone and the broader 2050 net-zero commitments.

Fraud and error linked to financial support during the coronavirus pandemic cost taxpayers £10.9 billion, a report has found.

The authors warned that only £1.8 billion has been recovered and said “much of the shortfall is now beyond recovery”.

The final report by the Covid counterfraud commissioner, Tom Hayhoe, found that many schemes, including Eat Out To Help Out and Bounce Back Loans, were rolled out quickly with significant risks.

He said many decisions taken during Covid lockdowns “paid too little attention to the risk of fraud”.

Hayhoe said in his report that while the support schemes were credited with helping to prop up the economy, prioritising speed in their delivery led to a “high level” of fraud risk.

More than 38 billion items of personal protective equipment were bought between February and July 2020. Around 11 billion items had not been used by March 2024 and losses amounted to around £10 billion, the report said.

Soup-maker Campbell’s beat Wall Street estimates for first-quarter sales, as consumers eat out less amid economic uncertainty.

The European Commission has opened a formal competition investigation into Google’s use of publishers’ and YouTube creators’ content to train and power its AI services.

Competition regulators will assess whether Google imposed unfair terms, granted itself privileged access, or hindered rival AI developers. The focus is Google’s use of web material for AI overviews and AI mode without compensation or a meaningful opt-out that wouldn’t jeopardise traffic. Investigators will also examine whether YouTube uploads have trained Google’s models without paying creators, while rival developers are blocked from similar data.

If proven, the practices could constitute abuse of dominance under EU law. Google said: “This complaint risks stifling innovation in a market that is more competitive than ever. Europeans deserve to benefit from the latest technologies and we will continue to work closely with the news and creative industries as they transition to the AI era.”

BMW has appointed Milan Nedeljkovic as chief executive, replacing long-time boss Oliver Zipse, as the carmaker prepares to launch a new generation of models in the face of strong competition from China and US tariffs that led it to cut its 2025 profit forecast.

Serbian-born Nedeljkovic, 56, is currently head of production and has been with BMW since 1993. He will take up the role on May 14. The company is pinning hopes on the first model from its all-electric Neue Klasse line to drive growth from 2026.

Supervisory board chair Nicolas Peter said Nedeljkovic “unites people and motivates them to achieve peak performance”.

The Railways Bill, which is scheduled for its second reading in the House of Commons today around 12.30pm, will create Great British Railways, bringing together 17 different organisations to run Britain’s railways as a single organisation.

Here is a glimpse of Great British Railways’ branding. This is what the Department of Transport said about it: “The design features a red, white and blue colour scheme and sharp angles to create a striking and memorable design mirroring the Union Flag. The GBR logo has also been revealed, featuring the iconic double arrow symbol in a nod to Britain’s proud railway heritage.”

The global airline industry is set to miss its green fuel targets, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) warned, citing limited production and regulatory hurdles. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), mainly made from waste or used cooking oil, cuts emissions but remains two to five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel. IATA projects SAF will account for just 0.8 per cent of total fuel use next year, despite the sector’s 2050 net-zero goal relying heavily on it.

Willie Walsh, the director-general, said: “It’s not an issue of price, it’s an issue of availability.” He warned many carriers could fail to meet their sustainability pledges in 2026, underscoring the gap between ambitious climate targets and the limited supply of SAF.

The pound has edged higher against the dollar and the euro this morning, helped by a weaker dollar on expectations of a US Fed rate cut.

UK borrowing costs have eased with bond yields down across the curve. The yield on the 10-year gilt, a proxy for government borrowing, was at 4.5 per cent, down 4 basis points.

Grocery inflation held steady at 4.7 per cent in the four weeks to November 30, data from Worldpanel showed. The early indicator precedes official UK inflation figures due on December 17 — food prices influence public inflation expectations, which are closely watched by the Bank of England.

Prices rose fastest for chocolate confectionery, fresh meat and poultry, while sugar confectionery, household paper and fragrances saw the largest declines. Grocery sales increased 3.4 per cent over the period, suggesting volumes fell after accounting for inflation. Retailers are boosting promotions to attract shoppers.

The data underlines ongoing cost pressures for households despite headline inflation easing to 3.6 per cent.

Stephen Schwarzman, the chief executive of American asset manager Blackstone, dismissed concerns over private credit after recent US bankruptcies of First Brands and subprime lender Tricolor. He said at the Abu Dhabi Finance Week that deals were underwritten and syndicated by banks, with private credit largely uninvolved.

Schwarzman said banks were leveraged at least ten to one, compared with about 1.4 times for private credit, emphasising that the latter is far more conservative and poses less systemic risk.

The Bank of England is concerned about threats that could be lurking in fast-growing but opaque and lightly regulated private markets. Andrew Bailey, the Bank governor, said recently that Tricolor and First Brands were partly financed by private credit, which had “intensified the focus” on possible risks in this area.

Hedge fund leaders and the Abu Dhabi investment council see 2026 as a year of opportunity amid geopolitical tensions and diverging interest rates. Speaking at Abu Dhabi Finance Week, Shiv Srinivasan, the chief investor at the state-backed fund, said rising market volatility from elections and global events favours macroeconomic and long-volatility strategies.

Robyn Grew, the Man Group chief, said volatility and market dispersion create trading opportunities, while Brevan Howard’s Aron Landy expects global asset value differences and interest rate divergence to drive gains. Landy also sees potential in cryptocurrencies, noting the risk lies in having no exposure. All emphasised that “with pain comes opportunity” for investors.

Thyssenkrupp expects a net loss of up to €800 million in 2026 due to costs relating to the restructuring of its steel unit, which it is in talks to sell to India’s Jindal Steel International.

The group has struggled to divest its steel division, Germany’s largest, largely due to €2.7 billion in pension liabilities. Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe caused €600 million in impairments last year in the face of Asian competition, US tariffs, and a weak European economy. Thyssenkrupp shares fell 4 per cent.

The US will allow Nvidia to export its H200 artificial intelligence chips, its second-best processors, to China and collect a 25 per cent fee on sales, President Trump said on Monday.

The move appears to settle a debate over whether US chipmakers should sell to China to maintain global leadership or restrict exports on security grounds. Beijing has warned companies against using US technology, raising uncertainty over demand.

“We will protect National Security, create American Jobs, and keep America’s lead in AI,” Trump wrote, adding that Nvidia’s US customers are moving ahead with its latest Blackwell and future Rubin chips, which are excluded from the deal.

Nvidia shares rose 2 per cent in after-hours trading. Trump said President Xi “responded positively”.

GENEVA, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The global airline industry is likely to miss its targets for green jet fuel use ​in the coming years, the International Air Transport Association said on Tuesday, blaming ‌fuel producers and regulators for the ""disappointing"" progress.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), made largely from waste or used cooking oil, can ‌cut emissions significantly compared with traditional jet fuel. However, it remains two to five times more expensive than conventional fuel.

IATA expects 2.4 million metric tons of SAF to be available in 2026, covering just 0.8% of total fuel consumption. That means the growth of the SAF ⁠sector has slowed - production growth ‌doubled between 2024 and 2025, but will likely only grew by 0.5 million metric tons between 2025 and 2026, IATA said.

The wider aviation ‍sector committed in 2021 to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, relying heavily on a gradual switch to SAF.

""We're not seeing SAF produced in the volumes we had hoped for and had expected. That ​is disappointing,"" the trade group's director general Willie Walsh told journalists. He had previously ‌warned that the 2050 net zero goal could be at risk.

Sustainable aviation fuel accounts for about 0.3% of the world's jet fuel use and was projected to reach only 0.7% by 2025, according to IATA data. Experts say production needs to grow quickly for the sector to meet its emissions goals.

Airlines have long said that they are willing to ⁠buy all of the SAF available, but accuse ​jet fuel producers of artificially inflating prices and failing ​to produce enough of the greener fuel.

""It's not an issue of price, it's an issue of availability, and they're just not able to get ‍their hands on the ⁠SAF that they require to fulfil the ambition that they expressed,"" Walsh said.

IATA's Chief Economist Marie Owens Thomsen added that regulatory mandates introduced by the European Union ⁠and Britain have encouraged fuel producers to raise prices on SAF even further, with Walsh adding that ‌the practice is synonymous with price gouging.

The real barrier for sustainable aviation fuel is not the technology and what can be done with biotechnology solutions in aviation fuel, but that it costs more.","Jacquelyn Francis founded The Global Warming Mitigation Project in 2017 when she realized that existing climate entrepreneurs around the world needed more exposure.

Since then, the Aspen-based organization, now called Climate Curve, has awarded $2.75 million to 80 innovators working to curb climate change. The awardees have gone on to raise $2.87 billion in investments.

In February 2026, Climate Curve is launching a new prize focused on methane emissions from food systems. The Climate Curve Prize: Methane will distribute $200,000 across eight solutions worldwide.

Francis told Aspen Public Radio’s Michael Fanelli that methane emissions are growing worldwide, and curbing them could act as a “parachute” to slow the trajectory of global warming.

The conversation below has been edited for clarity and length.

Michael Fanelli: Tell me about the forthcoming methane prize.

Jacquelyn Francis: So it's going to be a first-of-its-kind methane prize that's focused on the food systems. And that basically means everything from soil to soil. So everything where it's grown in agriculture, to livestock, to how things are transported. And also the waste, like what happens before and after it's thrown away, and it's a full cycle kind of idea of circular economy.

MF: Why is this an important thing to focus on now methane?

JF: Methane is just increasing in our world right now, and there's not a lot being done about that. It is a very potent greenhouse gas. It actually disperses into the atmosphere quite quickly. And it's a heat-trapping gas that actually traps 85% more heat than carbon dioxide. So if we were able to actually reduce our man-made methane impacts, then it could be considered like an emergency brake on our global heating that's happening right now. This could give us more time to actually move past some of the other really more embedded systems that we have in our world when it comes to fossil fuels. We're basically falling into a volcano, our entire civilization, and methane [reduction] is a way to kind of slow our fall.

MF: It sounds like this might have an agricultural focus. Can you talk about how this might be relevant to locals here in the Roaring Fork Valley?

JF: Yeah for sure, agriculture and waste [are] all part of our food systems. There are ways that you can actually grow your food differently that can produce less emissions. There are ways that you can feed your cattle differently to increase their ability to digest the food so that they don't have as much methane gas coming from their systems. There are also supplements that can be given to cattle and vaccines that can reduce their methane emissions by about 80-85%. A lot of companies are working on covering landfills in order to capture the methane emissions and then use them as an energy source.

MF: Your main thing you do as an organization is the Keeling Curve Prize. I realize there's been a lot, but can you think of an example or two of a memorable standout project that has won?

JF: There are a few that have really gone on to be incredible investment opportunities. One of those is a company called LanzaTech that actually is a publicly traded company now, and they make materials out of carbon that comes from all different kinds of sources. And one of the things they're working on is sustainable aviation fuel. So I've done a lot of extra work with LanzaTech as well, because I'm really, really interested in the idea of creating a market around sustainable aviation fuel. The real barrier for sustainable aviation fuel is not the technology and what can be done with biotechnology solutions in aviation fuel, but that it costs more. And we're not really willing as a society to pay more for our aviation fuel, which I find to be something that should change. So LanzaTech is one of them. We have a lot of nature-based solutions that I find super interesting. One of them, Canopy Planet, is about supply chains and getting your products from verified sources that have good practices.

MF: Was there anything else that you wanted to touch on?

JF: I think one of the things that I'd like your listeners to hear is: this is a problem that's fixable. And in my view, there are four existential crises in our world. It's nuclear warfare; it's an asteroid hitting us; it's some kind of biological or virus that takes everybody out that's much more powerful than Covid; And it's climate change — climate systems change. And I think people don't understand that this is such an important issue that we can solve, and this is probably the one out of those four that is the most solvable by human ingenuity and momentum building. We can do this. We just have to put more money behind it and more awareness and take on the challenge, just like humans are able to do in a lot of other situations. This is a huge endeavor, but we can do it, and the opportunities around it are — they're just immense. And that's what I want people to understand, that you have to do something about it, and we have to do something about it now, but we can.

MF: I think that's a good note to end on.

Fast Fact Australia’s new $1.1 billion Cleaner Fuels Program aims to kick-start domestic production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, with first ‘drop-in’ cleaner fuels expected by 2029.","The Australian Federal Government has announced it is investing $1.1 billion in low carbon liquid fuels.

This investment will reportedly bolster the sustainable fuel supply chain for all modes of transport.

The new 10‑year Cleaner Fuels Program is designed to stimulate private investment in Australian onshore production of low carbon liquid fuels, such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

The first production of ‘drop‑in’ cleaner fuels, which can be directly substituted for existing fuels and work in today’s engines, is estimated by 2029.

Australia has access to feedstocks including canola, sorghum, sugar and waste – the goods needed to make cleaner liquid alternatives.

Liquid fuels make up around half of Australia’s national energy use. Replacing those fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives could deliver a massive climate and economic opportunity.

Australia already exports nearly $4 billion of suitable feedstocks like canola and tallow.

The Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) estimates an Australian low carbon liquid fuel industry could be worth $36 billion by 2050.

Funding to make cleaner fuel on Australian shores, from Australian feedstock, will reportedly help back Australian innovators from the farmer to the fuel bowser, make domestic fuel supply greener and more resilient and make low carbon fuels available for early adopters.

Details about eligibility will be considered through public consultation and design work to take place this financial year. Grants will be awarded through a competitive process to ensure we get value for taxpayer funds.

The new production‑linked incentive builds on the government’s support via the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative and the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund. Recipients will also need to deliver benefits according to the community benefit principles under the Future Made in Australia Act.

The Government is also supporting the market by expanding the Guarantee of Origin Scheme to include low carbon liquid fuels and has established a fuel quality standard for renewable diesel.

A recent report from the CEFC found that a mature Australian low carbon liquid fuels industry could deliver around 230 million tonnes CO2‑e in cumulative emissions reduction by 2050. This is equivalent to 2.3 times Australia’s current annual transport emissions, or the annual emissions from 86 million cars.

“Low carbon liquid fuels are an enormous economic opportunity for Australia,” said Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers.

“It’s about making Australians and our economy big beneficiaries of the global Net Zero transformation.

“Developing this industry has potential to make us an indispensable part of growing global Net Zero supply chains.

“This is a downpayment on developing an entirely new industry in Australia.

“From the farm to the refinery, from primary production to processing, this will create more jobs and more opportunities for Australian workers and businesses.

“It’s another way we’re helping Australians grasp the big benefits on offer in the transformation to cleaner and cheaper energy – to help lift wages, grow living standards, create jobs and grow our economy.”

Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen, said making cleaner fuels locally from Australian feedstocks creates the path for emissions reduction in sectors that are hardest to clean up.

“Across the nation we have 2 billion litres worth of projects in the pipeline, many of which are ready to scale up production,” he said.

“A new thriving domestic industry with more jobs in our regions, from farmers growing the inputs to workers refining the fuels of the future is within our reach.

“$1.1 billion for low carbon liquid fuels production here in Australia builds on the $250 million we have already allocated to low carbon liquid fuels research and development through the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund.”

Murray Watt, Acting Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, said it is essential to invest in future fuels as demand for air travel grows and more goods are moved by road and rail.

“Low carbon fuels have the potential to be a $36 billion industry here in Australia, and we have the opportunity to lead the way on the production of these new fuels,” he said.

“We have the renewable feedstocks, access to clean energy and a strong agriculture base, all of which will allow us to develop this new industry, create new jobs and power how Australians move for decades to come.”

Julie Collins, Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, said this investment is great news for farmers and regional communities.

“Producing more low carbon liquid fuels right here in Australia won’t just benefit our fuel security and emissions reduction, it will support Australian farmers, foresters and our regions,” she said.

“Our farmers and foresters have always been innovators and our government is putting their expertise and world‑class production practices at the centre of growing Australia’s low carbon liquid fuel industry.

“This investment will complement our National Bioenergy Feedstock Strategy – which we are developing so our agricultural sector can seize the economic opportunities that come with feedstocks.”

NatRoad CEO, Warren Clark, also welcomes this announcement which is in line with NatRoad’s recommendations as part of its advocacy efforts.

“It’s good to see the Federal Government is listening to industry and taking action,” said Clark.

“NatRoad has been working behind the scenes for years now and thanks the government and the departments for making solid progress.

“We have provided multiple submissions recommending low carbon diesel as a key component of the broader plan, and providing monetary support to help kick-start the support and businesses required to reduce heavy vehicle emissions as we transition to Net Zero.

“This includes NatRoad’s Stronger Economy, Lower Emissions policy paper that included low carbon liquid fuels as one of our critical recommendations to government, and this week we provided a submission to the Productivity Commission’s inquiry into cheaper, cleaner energy solutions that supported policies aimed at increasing supply and lowering prices of low-carbon fuels.”

Clark added that while NatRoad welcomes this investment, managing the cost of using alternative fuels for road transport operators will be critical to their effectiveness in lowering heavy vehicle emissions.

“We have made it clear in our advocacy that the road transport industry needs a ‘fair go’ transition strategy, with a clear and cost-effective policy framework to ensure road transport operators aren’t forced to absorb higher fuel costs,” said Clark.

“This is particularly important at a time when margins are incredibly tight, and operators are already dealing with significant uncertainty around costs.”

Clark said the road freight sector is ready to adapt and support the transition to lower carbon-emitting ways of operating, but it is vital that measures are put in place to ensure as many road transport businesses can participate as possible.

“About 98 per cent of the road freight industry consists of small businesses, and we must ensure carbon reduction initiatives aren’t too costly, time consuming or complicated for them to take part,” said Clark.

“We look forward to continuing to work with the Federal Government to help bring about a transition to net zero emissions that is fair, cost-effective and accessible for all the road freight industry.”

In addition to its regular submissions to government on emissions-reduction initiatives, NatRoad has developed a Get Fleet Fit roadmap aimed at helping truck operators cut costs, improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions as part of the Net Zero transition.

Meanwhile, Victorian Transport Association (VTA) CEO, Peter Anderson, described this investment as a vital step in supporting the industry’s transition to a lower-emissions future.

“Low carbon liquid fuels are essential for heavy vehicles and machinery that cannot yet be easily electrified,” he said.

“Supporting local production of these fuels will help reduce emissions while maintaining the reliability and resilience of our supply chains.

“The VTA has long advocated for a supported and realistic transition, and this announcement shows the government understands that decarbonising freight will take time, investment and collaboration.

“We also urge continued support for freight operators, particularly small and medium businesses, as they adapt to new fuel technologies and infrastructure.”

The VTA continues to lead industry efforts to decarbonise through education, advocacy and collaboration.

On 18 November, the VTA hosted its Alternative Fuel Summit in Melbourne, bringing together experts, operators and policymakers to explore the theme ‘Is transport ready to decarbonise?’.

Now in its fourth iteration, the summit reflects the VTA’s ongoing commitment to helping members navigate the transition to low-emission technologies. The event will provide a platform for robust discussion and practical insights into the readiness of the freight sector for this significant shift.

“The Alternative Fuel Summit is about bringing the industry together to ask the hard questions and share knowledge,” said Anderson. “We’re proud to play a role in guiding our members through this transition and ensuring they’re equipped to meet the challenges and opportunities of a low-carbon future.”

Australian Logistics Council CEO, Dr Hermione Parsons, said the commitment is a milestone that recognises the scale of change required across the economy.

“Freight and supply chains enable every sector from agriculture to resources to health care,” she said.

“Decarbonising these systems is not simply an environmental imperative, it is essential to national productivity, resilience and prosperity. The Net Zero Plan sets a platform for action, and the ALC advocates for freight to be positioned at the centre of this transition.”

The plan, according to the ALC, identifies clean electricity, electrification, low carbon fuels and technology innovation as national priorities to ensure freight can contribute effectively to these goals.

“The ALC considers it essential to develop a nationally coordinated transition plan for heavy vehicles,” said Dr Parsons.

“This should include measures such as corridor charging and hydrogen refuelling infrastructure, depot energy planning, targeted operator incentives and reforms to licensing frameworks that currently limit workforce participation.

“The ALC also recommends addressing the operational realities of rail freight, including access regimes, pricing and last-mile bottlenecks to enable genuine mode shift rather than a narrow focus on new technologies.

“Freight continuity, redundancy and cross-border protocols should be embedded into disaster and infrastructure planning to strengthen resilience and prevent communities and businesses from being isolated during crises.”

The transition will also require a workforce transformation, the ALC added.

Investment in skills, training and VET pathways must be matched with deliberate measures to boost diversity and First Nations participation. Licensing and regulatory reforms should also support broader workforce participation, ensuring freight remains safe, efficient and inclusive as the sector modernises.

Infrastructure and construction must also be part of the solution according to the ALC. Measuring and reducing embodied emissions in steel, cement and concrete, embedding circular economy practices and aligning procurement standards will be critical to lowering the carbon footprint of freight infrastructure.

This demands cross-government collaboration, harmonised policy settings, consistent emissions reporting frameworks and interoperable data systems.

Dr Parsons said ALC will work closely with government to ensure the freight sector is positioned at the heart of the transition.

“Australia cannot reach its climate goals without freight,” she said.

“Placing freight at the centre of planning and reform will strengthen supply chains, deliver energy security and create new opportunities for investment and jobs.

“We welcome the ambition of the 2035 target and the Net Zero Plan, and we look forward to working with government and industry to build a resilient, productive and sustainable freight system that supports a prosperous, low-emissions future for Australia.”

Although researchers have made substantial progress in understanding the management and conversion of these crops, key knowledge gaps hold the industry back. Now, two new studies from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign help fill in the blanks for Miscanthus and switchgrass management.

“We have come a long way in our understanding of purpose-grown energy crops for SAF, but we still need to optimize agronomic management practices, like harvesting and nutrient management, to reduce production costs and incentivize growers,” said D.K. Lee, senior author of both studies and professor in the Department of Crop Sciences, part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences at U. of I.

Previous studies have been limited in spatial scale or focused on the first years after establishment, early in the perennial life cycle. But Lee’s group is working to provide more realistic, long-term solutions to maximize biomass productivity and grow a more sustainable fuel industry.

In the first of two recent studies, Lee’s team conducted an economic and environmental analysis of two harvest methods for switchgrass.

“Harvesting operations account for 60-80% of the total production costs for switchgrass,” said Muhammad Umer Arshad, postdoctoral researcher in Lee’s group and first author on the Bioresource Technology paper. “We wanted to understand why the harvesting cost is so high and how each operation contributes to cost, energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as identify where reductions are possible.”

Arshad explains that switchgrass harvesting can happen via the stepwise method, in which tasks like mowing, raking, baling, and roadsiding are separated into individual operations; or the integrated method, which uses different equipment to consolidate mowing and raking into one pass. Hypothetically, an integrated approach could reduce effort, energy consumption, and costs. But, after analyzing data from 125 Virginia commercial-scale sites varying in field size and biomass yield, Arshad found a more nuanced answer.

“We found that the integrated method makes more sense for smaller fields (less than 3 hectares, or 10 acres) and low-yield (less than 3.2 tons per acre) conditions, reducing GHG emissions by 9% and energy use by 5%,” Arshad said. “The stepwise method was better for large fields with high biomass yield, reducing harvesting costs to $37.70 per ton and achieving the lowest GHG emissions.”

The costs were estimated assuming the farmers are using their own machinery, tractors, and harvesting equipment.

Lee adds that the results reveal the importance of tailoring harvesting strategies to site-specific conditions and provide the first evidence-based guidance that harvest methods can improve both economic and environmental outcomes.

In a separate study published in Biomass & Bioenergy, the team tackled age-related declines in Miscanthus biomass yield, a function of tiller (stem) mass and density. These long-lived perennial grasses follow a predictable growth trajectory, including a juvenile stage that builds over several years to reach peak biomass yield, followed by a slow decline after about 10 years. Until now, it wasn’t clear which components of yield change over time and how nutrient management might help.

Postdoctoral fellow Nictor Namoi analyzed data from a long-term Miscanthus trial with nitrogen fertilization treatments that varied in amount and timing. First, he looked at how tiller mass and density changed over time and with various nitrogen treatments. Then, he asked what other soil fertility factors may influence the decline in biomass yield in older stands.

“We found that both tiller mass and density increase from the first year of establishment to the fourth year, and if you apply nitrogen, you get an increase in both factors,” Namoi said. “But over time, as you withdraw nitrogen by harvesting biomass, the first component to be impacted is tiller mass. So tiller mass is very sensitive to nitrogen management.”

Namoi adds that tiller density continues to increase until individual stands become saturated, with no more space for further expansion. After that point, biomass yield is determined by tiller mass.

He notes that the decline in biomass yield over time may not be entirely tied to nitrogen. With every harvest, soil nutrients tied up in plant biomass are removed from the system, depleting elements that play a role in photosynthetic efficiency. When Namoi analyzed soil phosphorus and potassium in mature Miscanthus stands, he found significant deficits in both essential nutrients.

“Our findings identify tiller mass as a key determinant of biomass yield in aging Miscanthus and highlight the need for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium management for long-term productivity,” he said.

Both studies provide practical guidance to increase profitability, a key factor for any producer looking to explore biomass crops.

At the same time, President Trump is securing new, unprecedented market access for American agricultural producers around the world.","(Washington, D.C., December 8, 2025) – President Donald J. Trump alongside U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman (AR), Senator Deb Fischer (NE), Senator John Hoeven (ND), Representative Austin Scott (GA), and farmers from Arkansas, Iowa, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas today announced the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will make $12 billion available in one time bridge payments to American farmers in response to temporary trade market disruptions and increased production costs that are still impacting farmers following four years of disastrous Biden Administration policies that resulted in record high input prices and zero new trade deals. These bridge payments are intended in part to aid farmers until historic investments from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), including reference prices which are set to increase between 10-21% for major covered commodities such as soybeans, corn, and wheat and will reach eligible farmers on October 1, 2026.

Of the $12 billion provided, up to $11 billion will be used for the Farmer Bridge Assistance (FBA) Program, which provides broad relief to United States row crop farmers who produce Barley, Chickpeas, Corn, Cotton, Lentils, Oats, Peanuts, Peas, Rice, Sorghum, Soybeans, Wheat, Canola, Crambe, Flax, Mustard, Rapeseed, Safflower, Sesame, and Sunflower. FBA will help address market disruptions, elevated input costs, persistent inflation, and market losses from foreign competitors engaging in unfair trade practices that impede exports. The FBA Program applies simple, proportional support to producers using a uniform formula to cover a portion of modeled losses during the 2025 crop year. This national loss average is based on FSA reported planted acres, Economic Research Service cost of production estimates, World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates yields and prices and economic modeling.

Farmers who qualify for the FBA Program can expect payments to be released by February 28, 2026. Eligible farmers should ensure their 2025 acreage reporting is factual and accurate by 5pm ET on December 19, 2025. Commodity-specific payment rates will be released by the end of the month. Crop insurance linkage will not be required for the FBA Program; however, USDA strongly urges producers to take advantage of the new OBBBA risk management tools to best protect against price risk and volatility in the future.

The remaining $1 billion of the $12 billion in bridge payments will be reserved for commodities not covered in the FBA Program such as specialty crops and sugar, for example, though details including timelines for those payments are still under development and require additional understanding of market impacts and economic needs.

The $12 billion in farmer bridge payments, including those provided through the FBA Program, are authorized under the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Charter Act and will be administered by the Farm Service Agency (FSA).

To submit questions, justification for USDA farmer bridge aid, or to request a meeting on farmer bridge aid, producers can reach out to farmerbridge@usda.gov.

“Four years under the failed Biden Administration continues to leave the American farm economy reeling from record inflation, a depleted farm safety net, and delayed disaster assistance. The lack of new trade deals under the last Administration turned a trade surplus under Trump into a $50 billion trade deficit, causing our farmers to lose markets and feel acute pain from lower commodity prices. President Trump will not let our farmers be left behind, so he directed our team to build a bridge program to see quick relief while the President’s dozens of new trade deals and new market access take effect,” said Secretary Brooke Rollins. “The plan we are announcing today ensures American farmers can continue to plan for the next crop year. It is imperative we do what it takes to help our farmers, because if we cannot feed ourselves, we will no longer have a country. With this program serving as a bridge to the improvements President Trump and Republicans in Congress have made, it will allow farmers to leverage strengthened price protection risk management tools and the reliability of fair trade deals so they do not have to depend on large ad hoc assistance packages from the government.”

Additional Farmer First Actions Taken by the Trump Administration

In addition to $12 billion in bridge payments announced today, the Trump Administration has been working around the clock since January 20th to put American farmers first after inheriting one of the worst farm economies the country has experienced in decades. The following actions have been taken to date and together show historic investments and bold and unrelenting dedication to helping our nation’s farmers thrive again.

Over $30 Billion in Ad Hoc Assistance Delivered to Farmers Since January 2025

Emergency Commodity Assistance Program (ECAP) is helping farmers recover from the economic hardships of 2024. This program distributed more than $9.3 billion to over 560,000 farmers for soy, corn, sorghum, and other row crops.

Marketing Assistance for Specialty Crops (MASC) is helping specialty crop producers recover from rising input costs and other market disruptions stemming from the Biden Administration. This program distributed over 1.8 billion in assistance to over 52,000 producers.

The Supplemental Disaster Relief Program (SDRP) is helping producers recover from severe weather events in 2023 and 2024. This program has distributed nearly $6 billion to over 388,000 farmers with up to an additional $9 billion to be distributed over the next four months.

Over $2.5 billion via block grants delivered to states and sugar beet and cane processors via block grants to cover losses from 2023 and 2024 that were left uncovered by existing USDA programs.

Trump Supported OBBBA Farmer Wins

With the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill in July, President Trump has made crop insurance more workable and affordable for American farmers and ranchers. Crop insurance is an essential risk management tool that allows American farmers and ranchers endure weather and market volatility. The bill increases crop insurance premium support for beginning farmers and ranchers by expanding the definition from five to 10 years of experience, enabling more producers to qualify for assistance over a longer period. These improvements will result in over $400 million in savings every year for America’s farmers on insurance premiums.

For the first time in over a decade the statutory reference prices for the farm safety net programs, ARC and PLC, were raised by 10-21% for major commodities such as corn, soybeans, and wheat. Thanks to OBBBA USDA is also expanding eligibility for these price support programs by adding more than 30 million new base acres to the program making them eligible for future PLC or ARC payments starting in crop year 2026.

OBBBA extended the marketing assistance loan programs through 2031 and updated loan rates for major commodities beginning in the 2026 crop year, providing stronger loan rates for crops like wheat, corn, cotton and soybeans.

The bill included historic investments to the domestic sugar programs and USDA made them available starting October 1, 2025. The loan rate for raw cane sugar has increased to an average 24 cents per pound for the 2025 - 2031 crop years, with refined beet sugar rates increased to an average of 32.77 cents per pound.

OBBBA invested in USDA’s major conservation programs, including the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) and Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP). These funds will result in over $34B in conservation work on agricultural land over the next 10 years.

OBBBA provides $285 million a year for agricultural trade promotion and facilitation. This is in addition to the existing $234M per year of funding for MAP and FMD. These dollars are key to opening and expanding foreign markets.

OBBBA included many important tax provisions for farmers and ranchers. Some of the most impactful provisions for agriculture are the permanency of the 20% qualified business income deduction, full bonus depreciation and the $15 million per individual estate tax exemption, now also indexed for inflation. With the current land values, equipment costs and input prices, even modest-sized farms can easily exceed that threshold, meaning upon the owner’s death, far more family operations would face massive tax bills than previously estimated. A permanent bonus depreciation means that farmers can continue to write off the entire cost of new equipment, land improvements, new barns and other capital upgrades in the year of purchase, rather than depreciating them over many years.

Oversight on Competition & Farmer Input Costs

On September 26, 2025, the USDA and the Department of Justice signed a Memorandum of Understanding (PDF, 1.3 MB) that represents a joint commitment by both agencies to protect American farmers and ranchers from the burdens imposed by high and volatile input costs—such as feed, fertilizer, fuel, seed, equipment, and other essential goods—while ensuring competitive supply chains, lower consumer prices, and the resilience of U.S. agriculture and the food supply.

On December 6, 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order to stop price fixing, anti-competitive behavior, and foreign influence that drives up prices and threatens the security of America’s food supply. This EO recognizes that sectors including seed, fertilizer, and farm equipment may be vulnerable to anti-competitive manipulation that result in higher prices for farmers and seeks to take aggressive action in part by the establishment of Task Forces created to investigate price fixing and anti-competitive behavior, especially regarding foreign owned entities.

These actions combined reiterate the Trump Administration’s commitment to scrutinizing competitive conditions in the agricultural marketplace, including antitrust enforcement that promotes free market competition.

Lowering Farm Labor Costs through Deregulatory Actions

Farm labor costs alone increased 47% since 2020 largely due to the high cost of utilizing the H-2A program to secure seasonal labor under the Biden Administration who artificially inflated Adverse Effect Wage Rates set by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) using USDA’s Farm Labor Survey which was never designed to be used for setting government-mandated wage rates and is duplicative of other DOL data sources. As such, USDA discontinued this survey while DOL issued a bold new interim final rule which decreased wage costs for H-2A agricultural employers resulting in initial savings of at least $2 billion. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a final rule, effective October 2, 2025, to streamline the filing process for certain temporary agricultural worker petitions. These actions combined are making farm labor more affordable and more accessible for American agriculture.

USDA is Prioritizing the Purchase of Healthy U.S. Grown Commodities to Feed Those Most in Need through Section 32 Buys

This year alone, USDA has provided nearly $1 billion in Section 32 purchases, all which benefit the charitable feeding network.

On November 24, 2025, Secretary Rollins announced a $30 million Section 32 buy of American grown oranges, grapefruit, and mandarins.

On August 6, 2025, Secretary Rollins announced a $2 million Section 32 buy of invasive Chesapeake Bay blue catfish.

On August 1, 2025, Secretary Rollins announced up to $230 million Section 32 buy of Alaska pollock, catfish, apples, beans and cranberries.

On May 23, 2025, Secretary Rollins announced a $67 million Section 32 buy of American groundfish, pears, cherries, shrimp and beans.

USDA will continue to buy Section 32 commodity purchases to support American seafood, fruit, vegetable, and tree-nut producers for distribution to U.S. food banks, schools, and other outlets serving low-income individuals. These actions support President Trump’s vision to Make America Healthy Again through U.S. local farmer grown, healthy, and nutritious commodities.

This is the most pro-biofuels Administration in history

President Trump recognizes how important the Renewable Fuel Standard is for American corn and soybean farmers. EPA Administrator Zeldin delivered the boldest Renewable Volume Obligations ever and provided much certainty in the market for our producers while delivering lower prices at the pump for consumers. The RVO gives the markets the incentive to invest in American products for American consumers and to export around the world.

EPA’s decision to allow the summer sale of E-15 constituted 2025 year-round E15 and continues to deliver immediate relief to consumers, give more choices at the pump, and drive demand for corn grown, processed, and used right here in America. America’s national security depends on our energy security, and biofuels are a crucial asset that brings more jobs and helps farmers in rural America.

List of Trade & Market Access Wins to Date

USDA announced applications are now open through January 23, 2026, for the $285 million America First Trade Promotion Program (AFTPP), a key component of the Trump Administration’s work to expand global market access and create new export opportunities for America’s farmers, ranchers, and producers.

Additionally, President Trump and his administration have worked to pen new trade deals and trade frameworks with more than 15 countries.

Switzerland and Liechtenstein will invest at least $200 billion in the United States, remove tariffs on several agricultural products, allow for market access for American beef, bison, and poultry, and remove non-tariff barriers for poultry and dairy.

El Salvador has removed non-tariff barriers including fumigation requirements and arbitrary geographic indicator restrictions on dairy product names.

Argentina will allow access for U.S. poultry and poultry products, within one year, and simplify red tape for U.S. exporters of beef, beef products, pork, and pork products. Argentina also has agreed to protect U.S. exporters’ use of certain meat and cheese terms, preserving market access and creating the potential for new opportunities in the region.

Ecuador has reduced or eliminated tariffs on American nuts, wheat, and wine; and will reduce major non-tariff barriers for many agricultural products regarding import licensing and facility registration requirements.

Guatemala will address and prevent barriers to U.S. agricultural products in its market; maintain science- and risk-based regulatory frameworks; and efficient authorization processes for agricultural products.

China committed to delaying new export controls on rare earth minerals, resume large purchases of U.S. soybeans, sorghum, and more. To date, China is already purchasing additional soybeans, wheat, and sorghum.

Malaysia will provide significant market access for U.S. products like dairy, horticultural products, poultry, pork, rice, and ethanol; recognize the U.S. food safety systems for U.S. meat, poultry, and dairy products; streamline its halal certification of U.S. food and agricultural products; and open market access for U.S. sorghum.

Cambodia will eliminate 100% of its tariffs on U.S. products, while the U.S. maintains a 19% reciprocal tariff rate for imports from Cambodia. It will also recognize the U.S. scientific guidelines for most U.S. agricultural goods and food.

Thailand will eliminate tariffs on 99% of U.S. goods, including most food and agricultural products and expedite access for USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service-certified meat and poultry products, giving American producers unprecedented access to the market.

Vietnam will accept preferential access for U.S. agricultural goods, including specialty cheese and meats, and is already improving access for U.S. peaches and nectarines. Vietnam will pay the United States 20% tariffs on all goods and 40% on any transshipped goods

South Korea will pay 15 percent tariff to the United States.

European Union will purchase $750 billion of American energy and addressing non-tariff barriers for farmers and ranchers - pork and dairy products. Market access for U.S. agricultural goods like tree nuts, sorghum, and more will also be provided as we work to commit to a simpler regulatory agenda.

Philippines is opening their market to the United States and charging us zero tariffs while the Philippines will pay 19 percent tariffs to the United States.

Indonesia will eliminate 90 percent of tariffs on American exports including for all agricultural products.

Japan agreed to $8 billion in American agricultural purchases including corn, soybeans, ethanol, fertilizer, and sustainable aviation fuel. Japan will increase US rice imports by 75%.

United Kingdom will create $5 billion in new agricultural export opportunities. $700 million in ethanol and better market access for American beef.

At the same time, President Trump is securing new, unprecedented market access for American agricultural producers around the world. For example, wine exports to Mexico are up 30 percent in 2025, reaching $18 million; South Korea has purchased $1 billion in corn, more than double from 2024; Bangladesh purchased $172 million in soybeans; Costa Rica streamlined its dairy access for U.S. producers; and India cut its bourbon tariff in half.

As the Victorian Farmers Federation president, he sees an opportunity for the agricultural industry in the growth of low-carbon fuels.

""We've seen it overseas for many years now.""

The Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) estimates an Australian low-carbon liquid fuel industry could be worth $36 billion by 2050, with many across the agricultural and industrial sectors saying it is an untapped market.

Renewable or low-carbon fuels are alternatives to fossil fuels and are often made from agricultural feedstock, such as canola oil, or waste products.

They are used in industries that cannot be easily electrified, such as heavy transport or aviation.

The United States, Brazil and the European Union are the largest low-carbon fuel producers globally.

Liquid gold

Australia exported nearly 6 million tonnes of canola from 2023–2024 to be turned into biofuel overseas.

Now industry is advocating to create a domestic market for Australia to create and use its own biofuel.

""It will be a big boost for farmers, to be sure,"" Mr Hosking said.

""We produce an incredibly high-quality product … using very low emissions in our cropping systems.""

Industry body GrainCorp's head of agri-energy Jesse Scott said a local industry would lead to more investment in regional Australia and would service domestic demand.

GrainCorp is working with Ampol and super fund IFM Investors to refine canola oil in Australia for use in the aviation industry.

""I fully expect that all parts of Australia are going to contribute feedstock,"" Mr Scott said, adding that Victoria would play a major role.

Waste not

In Victoria's east, a feasibility study is underway at the Australian Paper Mill, near Morwell, to investigate the viability of producing a new biofuel.

The paper mill's owner, Opal, has partnered with renewables developer European Energy Australia to assess the feasibility of carbon capture at the mill to capture biogenic carbon dioxide (CO2).

Biogenic CO2 is carbon dioxide produced from natural sources, and is already produced at the Maryvale facility as a by-product of pulping from one of its boilers.

When combined with renewable energy and water, biogenic CO2 can be used in the production of e-methanol, a low-carbon fuel and alternative to fossil fuels that can be used in freight ships.

European Energy has already used this technology in Denmark to supply e-methanol to international shipping companies.

Opal's general manager of environment and sustainability, David Jettner, said it was still early days but the project had the potential to generate between $25 million and $30 million.

Should it prove to be successful, the project could deliver a significant injection into the local economy — a substantial turnaround for the company, which axed 400 jobs in 2023.

Trash into treasure

The study is not the first biofuel project being explored in the Gippsland region.

An upcycling facility planned for the Wellington Shire that will recycle household waste into hydrogen and low-carbon fuels has been given the green light.

The project, being run by Zerogen, Boson Energy and Xseed Solutions, aims to extract hydrogen for aviation fuel by gasifying household waste.

Zerogen director Scott McArdle said the project would help to reduce waste while developing a low-carbon fuel that could be used in transport, particularly in aviation.

""We are targeting those municipal waste, kerbside garbage, non-recyclables,"" Mr McArdle said.

""Being able to reduce the existing pressures on our landfill infrastructure, we get to extend the life of those facilities and create new industries around it.""

Director of XSeed Solutions Craig Allen said the partners were working to secure funding, but the aim was to be operational by 2028.

""Our Gippsland project continues to progress well,"" he said.

""We're working closely with our partners as they finalise the initial funding round, which is expected to reach completion within the next couple of months.""

Need for a fuel injection

As part of its Future Made in Australia plan, the federal government is fast-tracking support for a low-carbon liquid fuel (LCLF) industry, recently announcing a $1 billion fund to encourage private investors to develop the market.

The government says the domestic LCLF industry will initially focus on sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel to reduce emissions in fuel-reliant sectors, including transport, mining and agriculture.

By 2040, an Australian renewable fuels industry could directly support 13,000 jobs and contribute $13 billion in GDP annually.

While the grants process has been welcomed by industry, proponents say more needs to be done to get it off the ground.

Mr Hosking said Australia would do well to follow the lead of the United Kingdom and European Union and mandate the use of LCLF, to guarantee a market for investors.

""We are talking billions of dollars to build a low-carbon liquid fuel plant, so it's not a small investment for anyone,"" he said.

""What we need is government to send a signal that there will be a guaranteed market for that product at the end.""",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/27eebb5b5c6afd5c799a42e20e0e3e6e?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=1578&cropW=2805&xPos=0&yPos=344&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-12-08 16:57:01.902828

Officials will determine the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Levy slightly differently for cargo shipments, and for general and business flights.","The Singaporean government will begin taxing the airfare of travelers departing from the country to compensate for the use of eco-friendly fuel.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) shared about the new tax in a November 2025 press release. Known as the “Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy,” the tax will apply to most flights departing from Singapore. These include passenger planes, cargo shipments, and “general and business aviation flights,” according to the government.

For most passengers, that levy won’t put too much of an added expense to their departure from Singapore. Depending on their cabin and flight destination, the additional fee will range from S$1 to S$41.60. That’s up to around $32 on the levy’s higher end. Travelers will see the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Levy as a distinct fee listed when booking with airlines, as part of their airfare. Notably, the Singaporean government will not tax travelers passing through the country on their way to their ultimate destination.

CAAS detailed that the levy money collected will solely be used to purchase “SAF and/or SAF environmental attributes (EAs)3.” It will also go toward covering “associated administrative costs.” Implementing the tax is Singapore’s way of hitting its goals for more sustainable air travel, with target dates in 2026 and 2030. With the rollout of the “SAF Levy,” Singapore will be the first country in the world to explicitly tax its flyers for the usage of the eco-friendly fuel.

What Else Is There To Know About Singapore’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Levy?

Flyers will begin seeing the tax on their airfare for tickets sold from April 1, 2026, applying to flights departing on or after October 1, 2026. How much tax will be tacked on depends on the length of a passenger’s flight and how much SAF the plane will need to fly, with aircraft required to use at least 1% of the more eco-friendly fuel. The Singaporean government notes that the levy is also determined by “the projected price premium of SAF over conventional jet fuel, and other associated costs, including the cost of certification, blending, and delivery.”

In addition to where they’ll be flying from Singapore, passengers will also be taxed based on their cabin class. Those flying economy will be taxed less than those flying in a premium cabin. Those in the latter section of the plane will pay four times as much for the levy.

Officials will determine the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Levy slightly differently for cargo shipments, and for general and business flights. Flights exempt from paying the tax include those made for “charitable or humanitarian purposes.”

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) provides insight on what sustainable aviation fuels are. It defines the energy as “renewable or waste-derived aviation fuels that meet sustainability criteria.” The source further asserted that “SAF has the greatest potential to reduce CO2 emissions from international aviation.”

“The introduction of the SAF Levy marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub,” said CAAS Director-General Mr. Han Kok. “It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub. We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses, and the public time to adjust.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ZV9mP9XaSwLKrQsC.xFzaw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/travel_noire_articles_954/43efcb6105b6cc970a11ce4c3e0c2fbb,N,,2025-12-08 15:58:26.869298

By turning national ambitions into implementation and collaborating with key partners such as Red Sea Global, we are driving meaningful progress across the Kingdom’s sustainability efforts.”

She added: “Our actions contribute directly to both the Kingdom’s domestic and global efforts to support sustainability and the environment, reinforcing Saudia’s role as a leader in advancing efforts for a more sustainable future for aviation.”

Produced through innovative processes that significantly reduce lifecycle emissions, The operation of SAF-powered flights represents a tangible step within Saudia’s broader contribution to the Kingdom’s sustainability efforts. Saudia Group is expanding its efforts by exploring other alternative fuel technologies, including Low Carbon Aviation Fuel (LCAF) and Emerging/Synthetic Aviation Fuels (eSAF), as part of the Kingdom’s efforts to manage GHGs, and use all available approaches and pathways to diversify energy sources to support sustainable development. These efforts contribute to the Kingdom’s broader transport sustainability targets, in line with its strategy to reduce carbon emissions.

Raed Albasseet, Group Chief Sustainability and Environment Officer at RSG, said: “We are proud to have been the first to introduce SAF into the Kingdom earlier this year, a milestone that reflects our commitment to reducing our emissions. Saudia was the first airline to operate flights to Red Sea International Airport, and it’s fitting that they are now the first to utilize our sustainable fuel supply.”

He added: “We are committed to utilizing all clean energy technologies, including renewable energy and advanced water reuse to low-carbon emission mobility, we’re setting a new benchmark for responsible, regenerative travel.”

As the Kingdom accelerates its transformation, milestones such as the introduction of sustainable aviation fuels highlight how collective national efforts are reshaping the future of air travel.

Today, challenges move faster, cross more boundaries and demand more interdisciplinary thinking than ever before.

In my work at ICF, a global consulting and technology services company, I see this every day. Our teams are on the front lines of some of the toughest challenges facing our generation.

We help communities detect disease outbreaks earlier by using advanced data analytics and improving communications across federal, state and local public health leaders. We supported the first transatlantic flight using 100% sustainable aviation fuel — overcoming one of the hardest barriers to decarbonizing the transportation industry. And we’re using AI-driven digital twins to help utilities navigate rising electricity demand from data centers, while strengthening grid reliability and keeping energy more affordable for vulnerable communities.

None of this work is simple. It requires people who can move between disciplines, ask hard questions and stay grounded in the data.

That mindset starts forming long before someone enters the workforce. The engineers who will tackle tomorrow’s challenges are in classrooms and labs right now, learning how to think, how to collaborate and how to approach uncertainty with curiosity rather than fear. That foundation matters. I know because UC Davis gave me mine.

How UC Davis Shaped the Way I Think

My career was shaped in profound ways by UC Davis. The faculty in the Department of Chemical Engineering were committed to teaching us to think, not just to memorize. My professors insisted we understand the underlying math and physics. They pushed us to break down problems instead of jumping to answers. And they expected a level of precision that, at the time, felt demanding but has served me well.

Just as meaningful were the hands-on experiences that brought engineering to life. Long days in the lab made the equations real. An internship with IBM taught me what I did and didn’t want to do with my degree. Studying abroad in England opened up an entirely new world. Those experiences helped me understand how theory meets reality, and they broadened my perspective.

They prepared me for graduate school at MIT and, ultimately, for a career at ICF that has spanned nearly four decades working at the crossroads of engineering, science, policy and technology. They also grounded me in a particular mindset: Solve the problem in front of you using data, technical rigor and collaboration. That approach has carried me through my entire career, and why I think it is important to give back.

My first gifts to UC Davis were small — contributions to an undergraduate scholarship fund. I wasn’t thinking about “philanthropy.” I was simply grateful for what I had received and wanted the next group of students to have something similar.

Years later, the college reached out with a proposal to support scholarships, upgrade aging lab equipment and help develop a new course called “Design of Coffee.” I loved the idea of making engineering accessible and fun without sacrificing precision. I agreed to support the plan and added a scholarship for a student to study abroad each year, because having that opportunity changed my own path.

Over time, my involvement expanded. I’ve served on the College of Engineering Dean’s Executive Committee for more than a decade, including several years as chair, and now chair the Manetti Shrem Museum Advisory Board. That combination may seem unexpected, but UC Davis has always brought together the analytical and creative, and the more I’ve learned about the university’s remarkable role in California’s art history, the more compelled I’ve felt to support it alongside engineering.

The reward for staying close has been seeing the impact firsthand: meeting students, watching new research and design spaces take shape, seeing labs modernized and hearing from scholarship recipients whose paths were changed because someone invested in them.

At the same time, the needs have grown. Enrollment is rising. State support is down. The demand for modern facilities and interdisciplinary learning environments continues to increase.

With these challenges, it’s important to give back. It’s important to invest in the next generation of changemakers.

Showing Up for the Next Generation

Engineers have always been problem solvers, but the problems ahead — AI ethics, climate resilience, sustainable energy, public health, global-scale digital modernization — require a different level of preparation. Students will need strong fundamentals, yes, but also experience working on messy, multidisciplinary challenges. UC Davis is well-positioned to give them that mix.

Philanthropy helps make that possible. Not just big gifts, but all forms: mentoring, advising, opening doors to internships, volunteering time, sharing hard-earned lessons and giving financially when you can. The three “W’s” as I call them — work, wisdom and wealth — are all essential when it comes to giving back. It’s a collective effort focused on continuity, helping ensure students have access to the kinds of transformative, hands-on experiences that shaped me, and that remain essential for the world they’re stepping into and the problems they’ll help solve.

I’ve spent my career working on complex issues. But nothing has been more meaningful than supporting the UC Davis students who will take on the challenges we can’t yet see. The future will be demanding, but it’s full of promise. And every step we take to support today’s students brings us closer to the breakthroughs our world needs.",https://engineering.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk2151/files/styles/sf_landscape_16x9/public/media/images/Wasson.png?h=d1cb525d&itok=YANbxV6z,N,,2025-12-08 18:57:05.542047

Fuel security in Europe is at a crossroads

Over 60% of Europe’s energy is imported, leaving defense operations exposed to external disruptions and market volatility.

Europe is also facing a significant jet fuel deficit. 750,000 barrels per day were imported in July 2025, covering 88% of Europe's average daily demand. Just a few years ago, from 2017 to 2023, imports only accounted for 30% of the region's needs.

This necessitates a reassessment of military fuel readiness.​ Continued reliance on crude oil imports to produce kerosene in European refineries represents an increasing risk due to geopolitical tensions and potential disruptions of the fuel supply chains, not least in wartime.

NBAA said the legislation has raised “significant concerns for business aviation,” which per Derner has caused some operators to reconsider renewing their leases in the state.
In other words, the buyer of a $600,000 aircraft would be taxed $10,000 because they surpassed that threshold by $100,000.
NBAA is targeting net-zero emissions from business aviation operations by 2050—a goal shared by many U.S. and international organizations.
Derner told FLYING that the Washington coalition may be the first of many.","Aviation industry groups are uniting to fight legislation in Washington state that they argue is based on a “grossly uninformed understanding” of high-value aircraft.

That was the language used by the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA), National Air Transportation Association (NATA), General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), Vertical Aviation International (VAI), Corporate Angel Network (CAN), and Angel Flight West in an April letter to Washington Governor Bob Ferguson.

Earlier this year, Ferguson signed off on a provision that will levy a 10 percent tax on the sale, lease, or transfer of noncommercial aircraft valued at over $500,000—as well as users of those aircraft. Proceeds will be deposited into the state’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Account.

On Monday, NBAA announced it formed a coalition with the explicit goal of opposing the tax, which it described as “burdensome” despite the admirable goal of sustainability. Phil Derner, NBAA’s Western region representative, told FLYING the coalition comprises all of the aforementioned groups as well as chambers of commerce and smaller members, including the organization’s entire Washington state mailing list.

NBAA said the legislation has raised “significant concerns for business aviation,” which per Derner has caused some operators to reconsider renewing their leases in the state. He said that while business operators are “at the forefront” of the issue, the luxury tax would affect “nearly every corner of general aviation.”

Per NBAA, the coalition is working to open lines of communication with “key partners,” including the bill’s sponsor. Recently, it said, about 100 stakeholders met at Seattle Paine Field International Airport (KPAE) to discuss their needs and hear from Washington State Representative Tom Dent—a “strong industry advocate” and leader of the state’s aviation caucus.

“Sustainability is a driving force for NBAA and the broader aviation industry, as evidenced in our 2050 net-zero emission target and advocacy for sustainable aviation fuel,” Derner said in a statement. “This coalition is intent on communicating that commitment, while also dispelling misconceptions and highlighting aviation’s positive contributions to environmental progress. We are here to build a constructive relationship that incentivizes and empowers our industry to be a better participant in sustainability and a better neighbor in communities throughout the state, not just in the big cities.”

Case For (and Against) a Luxury Aircraft Tax

Washington state’s 10 percent tax on luxury noncommercial aircraft is set to take effect in April, impacting aircraft plus trade-in property valued over $500,000. For leased aircraft, fair market value at the start of the lease must be greater than $500,000.

Tax will be collected only on the “portion of the selling price in excess of $500,000,” the bill reads. In other words, the buyer of a $600,000 aircraft would be taxed $10,000 because they surpassed that threshold by $100,000. However, Derner said some in the industry have interpreted the language to mean the tax would be $60,000, or 10 percent of the full $600,000 price.

The idea behind the legislation is to generate fresh funding for transportation sustainability projects. But NBAA and other groups in their letter warned it could have “sweeping, unintended consequences” for the state’s economy.

Stakeholders argued that costly, noncommercial aircraft are not just luxury items. CAN and Angel Flight West, for example, operate networks of volunteer pilots that fly to underserved rural areas.

Other organizations, including the Washington State Department of Natural Resources’ aviation division, use expensive helicopters—like the Bell UH-1H(M) Huey—to battle blazes from above or evacuate victims. Agricultural operators often fly costly aircraft for crop dusting and environmental monitoring.

All of these stakeholders, the groups said, would be negatively impacted by the higher tax.

Business and recreational flyers will feel the difference, too, as will airports, which could see fewer operations. According to the groups, operations that would be affected by the tax support 407,000 airport jobs and generate $8.6 billion in economic output. In addition, 107 repair stations, 22 flight schools, 4,400 instructors and nearly 8,000 students would be “adversely affected,” they said.

NBAA said the legislation passed with “limited industry input,” prompting the formation of a coalition to extol the industry’s commitments to sustainability.

NBAA is targeting net-zero emissions from business aviation operations by 2050—a goal shared by many U.S. and international organizations. In 2019, it created an Emerging Technologies Committee to advocate for industry-friendly rules for new, environmentally friendly entrants—drones, electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) air taxis, supersonic jets, and others.

eVTOL aircraft, in particular, will have a “profound impact” on the industry’s future, NBAA wrote in a 2019 report titled “Business Aviation Embraces Electric Flight.”

At the group’s 2025 Business Aviation Convention and Exhibition (NBAA-BACE) in October, attendees could purchase helicopter flights from Blade Air Mobility, whose passenger division was acquired by eVTOL developer Joby Aviation in August. While those trips weren’t electric, passengers had the chance to speak with Joby representatives about the company’s plans to integrate air taxis on the Blade platform. That combination—as well as a planned integration with Uber —could happen in the next few years.

“By resetting the business aviation community’s relationship, we intend to keep legislators and the public better informed on our industry’s commitment to Washington state, its economy and its environment,” Derner said of the new coalition.

Derner told FLYING that the Washington coalition may be the first of many. He emphasized NBAA’s effort to improve communication with policymakers in order to proactively provide input, rather than react to signed legislation.",https://flyingmag1.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/BAI-March-April-2021-Member-Profile-Premier-Bone-King-Air-C90A-ramp.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 14:56:21.186272

To initiate this engagement, in collaboration with leading management consultants Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Roland Berger and Estuaire, RMI has led a series of corporate contrail accounting and reporting pilots to develop and compare methodologies for measuring contrail impacts associated with business air travel.

Three proposed methodologies for contrail accounting with different levels of complexity and accuracy were assessed:

Baseline Approach: Standard Multiplier — The baseline approach uses a single, static 1.7x multiplier on the CO2 impact, to account for the non-CO2 climate impacts of aviation, including contrails.

Differentiated Default Approach: Tiered Multiplier — A tiered multiplier offers a more nuanced method by sorting flights into low, medium, and high-impact categories based on key flight characteristics such as time of departure, season, region, etc.

Bottom-Up Approach: Flight Specific Modeling — The most granular and accurate method is the bottom-up approach, which models the specific climate impact of each individual flight. This technique uses detailed operational data to calculate climate impact.

These studies found that flight-by-flight, bottom-up accounting can significantly improve the accuracy of measured contrail and other non-CO2 effects as well as CO2 impact compared with current standard methods. Results revealed lower contrails and other non-CO2 effects averaging a 1.3x impact compared to the baseline 1.7x multiplier as well as lower CO2 emissions compared to standard emissions accounting practices. The pilot analysis also revealed 2% of flight bookings account for 80% of total contrail impact.

As a result of these findings, applying a uniform multiplier to all flight bookings may misrepresent the true climate impact of reporting companies.

Additionally, the results indicate the opportunity to significantly reduce corporate travel emissions by identifying key flight characteristics attributable to high warming impacts. Companies could use their air travel and transport data to make more informed decisions that help minimize travel on routes with higher contrail-formation potential, providing an additional lever to reduce climate impact.

Acting now to explore and pilot refined emissions accounting and reporting approaches can further support collective efforts to reduce the climate impact of contrails and unlock both environmental and economic benefits through lower aviation emissions.

Contrail management is a significant opportunity to tackle aviation’s full climate impact. According to ICCT’s September 2025 Aviation Vision 2050 outlook report, contrail avoidance is estimated to represent more than 40% of total avoidable warming from aviation by 2050. While critical decarbonization efforts such as increasing the uptake of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and improving operational efficiency must continue to be pursued, it is clear that the climate-warming impact of contrails demands action.

Increased research attention in recent years has enhanced understanding of contrails as a potent aviation non-CO2 effect , and the development and testing of technologies to predict and avoid contrail formation continue to advance. These contrail management activities have strongly improved the aviation industry’s opportunity to reduce contrail warming. However, contrail science and management is still nascent and requires continued collaboration across key groups, including corporates, airlines, standard setters, regulators, and other aviation and emissions accounting and reporting value chain stakeholders. Increased engagement across these stakeholders can help create the right data flows and incentives to more accurately measure and mitigate contrail warming impacts.

In tandem with continuing climate impact research and solutions development advancements, initiating demand-side aviation customer engagement today on the topic of contrail management can help raise awareness of contrail impact and advance exploration of comprehensive air travel climate impact accounting frameworks.

To initiate this engagement, RMI led a series of corporate aviation emissions accounting pilots, in collaboration with leading management consultancies BCG and Roland Berger, as well as flight analytics platform provider Estuaire. These studies found that flight-by-flight, bottom-up accounting can significantly improve the accuracy of measured contrail and other non-CO2 effects, as well as CO2 impact, compared with current standard methods. Current contrail and non-CO₂ accounting processes, while precise (as they are based on a fixed multiplier), are not necessarily accurate, as they lack the specificity derived from additional bottom-up data. Beyond refining report quality, the pilot results revealed data granularity can uncover opportunities to reduce air transport climate impacts.

Today, companies are likely to inaccurately report contrail climate impacts by applying broad, static multipliers to their CO2 emissions. Applying the flight-specific bottom-up approach, results revealed lower contrails and other non-CO2 effects averaging a 1.32x impact compared to the baseline 1.7x multiplier as well as lower CO2 emissions compared to standard emissions accounting practices. The pilot analysis revealed 2.14% of flight bookings account for 80% of total contrail impact. As a result, applying a uniform multiplier to all flight bookings would misrepresent their true climate impact. Additionally, the results indicate the opportunity to significantly reduce corporate travel emissions by identifying key flight characteristics attributable to high warming impacts. Companies could use their air travel and transport data to make more informed decisions that help minimize travel on routes with higher contrail-formation potential, providing an additional lever to reduce climate impact.

With data-driven and consistent contrail accounting and reporting methodologies in place, corporate customers of aviation have the opportunity to measure and disclose both the CO2 and non-CO2 climate impact of business air travel more accurately than reported under current processes. This could help enable companies to explore internal travel policy adjustments based on improved reporting processes that may limit contrail impacts associated with future business air travel. Additionally, with more granular data, companies can better ensure that climate impact compensation strategies reflect the emissions they actually generate. Refined emissions accounting approaches enable companies to align reported impacts more closely with actual flight-level conditions, improving accuracy and strengthening consistency with compensation mechanisms such as carbon credit purchases.

Strengthening corporate emissions accounting and reporting practices for contrail impacts can help air transport customers, such as corporate travelers and freight shippers, better understand aviation’s full climate impact. By piloting and applying refined emissions accounting methods, these customers can begin to account and report contrail impacts more accurately, while identifying practical actions to reduce them.

By engaging constructively with data providers, airlines, standard setters, and other aviation and emissions accounting value chain stakeholders, corporate customers can help shape emerging contrail management practices and contribute to more comprehensive aviation climate accountability. Acting now to explore and pilot refined emissions accounting and reporting approaches can further support collective efforts to reduce the climate impact of contrails and unlock both environmental and economic benefits through lower aviation emissions.

Additional contrail science and management research is needed to understand the scale of contrails’ climate impact and the feasibility of levers available to mitigate it. In the absence of certainty, best practice to date has been to apply a multiplier of 1.7x to CO2 emissions to account for non-CO2 impacts, including contrails. This multiplier was identified based on the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) analysis of the non-CO2 climate impacts of aviation released in 2020. Although establishing this initial multiplier has been a positive step in the right direction, its application is far too broad considering the remaining uncertainty bands associated with contrail impact – despite tightening consensus among research conducted over the last five years — as well as significant climate impact variability from flight to flight based on factors such as region of travel, season, flight time of day, actual weather conditions at the time of flight, and aircraft performance characteristics. By using a singular multiplier in this way, companies may be significantly under- or over-reporting their emissions attributable to contrails. Moreover, using a flat multiplier does not provide any incentive to make more informed, sustainable flight choices with a lower likelihood of contrail warming.

Additionally, differences in emissions calculation methodologies set by regulatory agencies can make it difficult to compare emissions reported from one company to another. Depending on the emissions factor agency source, two or more companies, for example, may report significantly different results even if they theoretically were to have traveled on the exact same flights for the year.

Furthermore, even within the same regulatory agencies, emissions factors can change from year to year and are subject to global economic activity. This can make it difficult for companies to contextualize emissions from one year to the next. For example, UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) 2025 GHG emissions factors for business air travel were adjusted downward between 16% to 42% depending on seating class from 2024 emissions factors. Emissions factors used in 2023 and 2024 were still based on 2021 data, a year that was impacted by the COVID pandemic resulting in lower air travel demand. This inflated annual per passenger emissions factors for 2023 and 2024 reporting years, which saw air travel demand normalize during the post pandemic recovery. In this case, CO2 emissions (and non-CO2 emissions) were likely over reported in general during this period. Therefore, emissions factor update delays such as this can significantly impact the ability of companies to accurately report emissions and achieve their climate targets.

In collaboration with leading management consultancies BCG and Roland Berger and flight analytics platform provider Estuaire, RMI has led a series of corporate contrail accounting and reporting pilots to develop and compare methodologies for measuring contrail impacts associated with business air travel. Three proposed methodologies for contrail accounting with different levels of complexity and accuracy were assessed.

Baseline Approach: Standard Multiplier

The baseline approach uses a single, static multiplier to account for the non-CO2 climate impacts of aviation, including contrails. This method is straightforward, applying a universal multiplier value of 1.7x to a flight’s CO2 emissions and requiring no additional flight-level data for calculation. While this method is simple to implement for quick estimates, it fails to account for key factors that influence contrail formation, such as weather conditions, flight trajectory, aircraft characteristics, time of day, season, and region. As a result, in addition to having limited ability to accurately account for contrails as previously discussed, this approach fails to incentivize better operational practices. Without understanding and improved visibility of contributing contrail impact variables, businesses are limited in their ability to explore meaningful opportunities to reduce their Scope 3 emissions.

Differentiated Default Approach: Tiered Multiplier

A tiered multiplier offers a more nuanced method by sorting flights into low, medium, and high-impact categories based on key factors mentioned above. For example, known factors such as time of departure, season, region, etc. could apply contrail risk scores that are summed and then allocated into impact categories based on standard scoring thresholds. Average multipliers per category could then be applied per flight. This method encourages better business air travel policy opportunities when compared to the baseline approach. By grouping general flight characteristics and knowing the emissions multiplier to apply to the flight in advance of travel, companies may be able to manage emissions more effectively.

However, as an approximation of the potential contrail impact, this approach remains limited to inform accurate decision-making: flights with significantly different contrail risk may still fall into the same category, limiting the ability to target high-impact routes. This weakens both the accuracy of Scope 3 reporting and the effectiveness of corporate travel emissions strategies. Additionally, the forecast contrail impact from a selected flight may differ significantly from the actual impact once the flight has been completed, which again may limit emissions accounting and reporting accuracy.

Bottom-Up Approach: Flight-Specific Modeling

The most granular and accurate method is the bottom-up approach, which models the specific climate impact of each individual flight. This technique uses detailed operational data, including aircraft and engine type, flight trajectory, and altitude in combination with weather conditions, time of day, flight origin and destination, and flight booking class to calculate climate impact. This approach provides the highest accuracy impact calculation — for both contrails and other non-CO2 effects and CO2 emissions — and best incentivizes the implementation of targeted travel emissions reduction policies. Additionally, the bottom-up analysis is currently the most closely aligned approach to the EU non-CO2 MRV framework for airline reporting, which can result in greater transparency and consistency in emissions disclosures from both corporate travelers and airlines. This approach, however, may have higher costs associated with detailed data collection requirements and the need for specialized service providers to conduct analyses.

Exhibit 1

Pilot Key Findings and Insights

For this set of pilots, Estuaire conducted an analysis of the contrail impact associated with flight bookings over 2024. Applying the flight-specific bottom-up approach, results revealed lower contrails and other non-CO2 effects averaging a 1.3x impact compared to the baseline 1.7x multiplier as well as lower CO2 emissions compared to standard emissions accounting practices. The study revealed 2% of flight bookings account for 80% of the total contrail impact, as illustrated in Exhibit 2 below. This highlights the highly uneven distribution of contrail effects across flights, including flights that produced contrails with cooling effects. As a result, applying a uniform multiplier to all flight bookings would misrepresent its true climate impact. Additionally, analyses confirmed initial hypotheses such as higher radiative forcing impact during winter and cool spring and fall months, evening and nighttime flights, and along medium- and long-haul routes. Based on these results, each company is now better positioned to take additional steps toward more informed decisions on opportunities that can reduce the full climate impact of their business air travel.

Exhibit 2

Further analysis confirmed the non-linearity of contrail impact with respect to both seasonality and departure time. Specifically, Exhibit 3 below shows that flights departing in winter months exhibit a higher mean contrail impact per distance flown compared to those departing in summer.

Exhibit 3

Exhibit 4 below highlights that morning departures tend to have a lower mean contrail impact per distance than late afternoon flights.

Exhibit 4

It is well known that you can’t manage what you don’t measure. Companies that are able to leverage data to understand the complexity and feasibility of potential reduction levers have the opportunity to be better positioned to convert information into actionable context-sensitive travel policies. Tools and service providers are now available to conduct detailed flight-level emissions analysis. Additionally, resources such as the Travel Impact Model (TIM) can help companies estimate future air travel impacts associated with specific flights.

Although significant advancements have been made in recent years, it is important to note that accurate contrail forecasting remains a challenge, given contrail formation is highly dependent on real-time weather conditions, which are difficult to measure with accuracy in real time, and aircraft operating characteristics such as altitude. These challenges make the exercise of identifying specific flights that may reduce air travel climate impact more complex. Without certainty that contrail forecasts will result in contrail formation or understanding the aircraft operating characteristics, companies risk making well-intentioned decisions to reduce flight impacts that may not be realized for unforeseen reasons. Reducing this risk calls for companies to use detailed historic company-level air travel emissions analysis in combination with tools such as TIM to help make informed travel policy adjustments that may reduce their future business air travel climate impacts.

It is also important to acknowledge that business travel decisions are not made in a vacuum. Not only do businesses need to account for their air travel emissions footprint, but they must also take additional factors into consideration, such as client needs, cost of travel, as well as other Scope 3 emissions that impact business decisions. For example, a business may have the option to take a flight that is likely to have low contrail impact compared to another flight at a different time of day, but if this alternative doesn’t meet the needs of a client, then a higher potential impact flight may be necessary to meet project demands. Similarly, if a lower contrail impact flight is available but would require an additional night of lodging, for example, the additional cost and emissions associated with the trip extension could exceed the available travel budget and/or negate the avoided contrail impact.

Therefore, companies could benefit from exploring comprehensive, customized travel policy guidelines based on the relationship between contrail impact forecasts, flight time and availability, cost considerations, and regional/local emissions at the business destination, enabling more effective and targeted reductions in aviation-related climate impacts. To help generate employee buy-in, companies could explore embedding incentives within travel booking tools for employees to encourage the selection of low-emissions options. Companies could also consider developing educational and policy training materials that detail the importance of more accurate emissions accounting and the role company personnel can play in reducing emissions.

Key Stakeholders

The corporate emissions accounting and reporting chain is a complex ecosystem with a diverse range of stakeholders, each with a vested interest in the accuracy, transparency, and use of the reported data. Each plays a distinct role in defining, generating, managing and verifying the data that underpin credible corporate disclosures, and together they form the foundation on which future contrail and other non-CO2 accounting and reporting can build. As air travel contrail impact and non-CO2 emissions corporate accounting processes continue to develop, each stakeholder group will need to be engaged to raise awareness and ensure cohesion and practicality.

Reporting companies (i.e., air transport customers such as corporate travelers and freight shippers) compile air travel and freight transport data from internal systems and external partners to calculate aviation emissions. Within companies, ESG, finance, accounting, and air transport management teams coordinate disclosure and data governance, integrating both CO2 and non-CO2 effects into their business operations. Continued engagement in pilot projects could help to refine contrails and other non-CO2 emissions accounting methodologies and test their viability in real-world settings. By sharing learnings transparently, corporates could help to collectively strengthen the evidence base for refined accounting methods.

Travel management companies or freight forwarders act as intermediaries connecting corporate customers to airlines and carriers. They provide flight-level booking and activity data, such as routes, distances, and seating classes, that serve as key inputs for aviation emissions accounting. Coordination between data providers, reporting companies, and emissions accounting providers could help to develop data management processes that enable improved efficiency in data analysis.

Emissions accounting and analytics providers (including both internal corporate teams and external modeling partners) convert flight activity data into quantified CO2, contrail impact, and other non-CO2 outputs. Depending on data availability and other factors, they may apply standard emission factors or calculate results using actual flight-level information through bottom-up modeling approaches provided. Continued engagement in pilot projects to test accounting methodologies could help these service providers better understand existing challenges to data collection activities and support the development of solutions to address them in collaboration with data providers and reporting companies.

Verification and assurance providers review corporate emissions data for completeness, consistency, and credibility. As flight-level and contrail-related accounting practices mature, these actors could play an important role in developing corresponding verification criteria. Engaging them early could help identify what evidence and data transparency are necessary for acceptance within established assurance processes.

Voluntary standard setters and guidance providers, including GHG Protocol and SBTi provide voluntary frameworks for stakeholders across the aviation value chain to establish accounting boundaries, methodological consistency and disclosure expectations. These organizations play a foundational role in shaping how corporate emissions are measured and disclosed. GHG Protocol is currently revising its corporate, Scope 2, and 3 standards guidance with plans to finalize updates in 2027. In parallel, SBTi is undertaking a major update to its Corporate Net-Zero Standard (v2.0) and the initiative has indicated plans for a formal aviation sector update process. Together, these revision efforts create a key window for aviation and corporate stakeholders to contribute insights that reflect advances in refined accounting methodologies and the growing understanding of contrails and other non-CO2 effects.

Regulatory bodies such as the European Commission, the European Environment Agency (EEA), the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the UK Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) design and implement compliance frameworks, such as the EU’s MRV regulation, that are beginning to include non-CO2 effects and may influence future corporate reporting. These bodies influence methodology and emissions factors development. Engaging in early dialogue with these regulators could potentially improve alignment across frameworks and avoid duplicative or inconsistent requirements as contrails and other non-CO2 effects accounting matures.

Aircraft operators (i.e., airlines, carriers) hold primary operational data, such as fuel use, aircraft type, flight trajectory, and increasingly contrail-related parameters. Their participation in research pilots and collaboration with data and modeling providers could significantly support improving the quality and accessibility of flight-level information that supports more accurate accounting. Additionally, industry associations and standardization bodies such as the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Civil Aviation Association (ICAO) could potentially serve as critical conveners to align aviation accounting practices. Their collaboration could help ensure alignment with air travel provider emissions accounting developments.

Broader aviation value-chain participants, including SAF suppliers, airports, aircraft lessors, financial institutions, and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), all share accountability for the emissions generated through air transport. Each may also influence the accuracy and flow of emissions of data through their operations, financing, infrastructure and technology innovation.

Data platforms and registries serve as connective infrastructure for emissions information across the aviation value chain. The emerging Sustainable Aviation Fuel certificate (SAFc) book and claim system and SAFc Registry illustrate how verified GHG emissions information can move transparently along the value chain, providing a useful model for how shared data infrastructure might support future contrail and non-CO2 accounting.

At present, coordination among these stakeholders remains limited, with data and responsibility distributed across different parts of the value chain. Developing a cohesive and transparent accounting and reporting ecosystem capable of addressing aviation’s full climate impact calls for expanding collaborative pilots, improving data-sharing protocols, and engaging in explorative discussions with standard setters.

Envisioning a Future State

As we look forward to when accounting and reporting for contrails and other non-CO2 effects of aviation become standard practice, we can compare the existing process steps to a future state. For the most part, steps remain consistent. The primary difference lies in the increasing accuracy and consistency of data inputs and the tools used to analyze them.

In today’s process, corporates often rely on broad emissions factors and multipliers to estimate non-CO2 impacts including contrails. In the future, these generalized methods may be complemented by more differentiated, data-driven approaches that better capture variation across flights and conditions. Depending on the data access and analytical capability, corporates could use tiered multipliers or detailed flight-by-flight analyses to enhance accuracy and transparency. Companies can coordinate with their travel management or logistics service providers and emissions modeling and data providers to conduct analyses.

Exhibit 5 - Standard vs. bottom-up corporate emissions accounting process

To enable more consistent and verifiable data exchange, a minimum standard for flight-information reporting (e.g., flight number, date and time, aircraft type) could be established across airlines, travel or logistics service providers. Such alignment would improve data quality and interoperability, supporting high-fidelity inputs for both CO2 and emerging contrails and other non-CO2 effects accounting and reporting practices.

To achieve this future state, an illustrative phased framework is envisioned (see Exhibit 8). This preliminary framework could help guide organizations through incremental steps, beginning with the adoption of current best practices in emissions accounting and gradually integrating more advanced, differentiated default and bottom-up methodologies for greater accuracy and comprehensiveness.

This pilot initiative and report fall into Phase 1, focusing on the conceptualization and initial testing of refined accounting methodologies and processes that allow corporates to capture aviation’s full climate impact. The pilots have demonstrated how refined, flight-by-flight data can improve the accuracy of reported emissions.

Phase 2 could focus on enhancing awareness and building capacity by engaging key stakeholders, as previously discussed. Additional corporates could begin to explore, pilot, and refine emissions accounting approaches. These follow-on pilot projects could continue to provide valuable insights into the practical challenges and opportunities of detailed emissions measurement, informing future improvements and standardization efforts.

As experience and confidence in advanced emissions methodologies grows and sufficient data has been collected and analyzed, Phase 3 of the framework could support the development of customized low emissions travel policies and broader adoption across the corporate sector. Corporates could start to explore alignment opportunities with air service providers on contrails and other non-CO2 emissions accounting practices, deepening partnerships with travel management and emissions accounting providers, strengthening internal capacity through training and education for employees, and help build coalitions to accelerate alignment with revised, science-based emissions accounting standards.

Last, Phase 4 could recognize the adoption of refined emissions accounting approaches, enabling scaled application.

Ultimately, a phased approach could ensure that the transition to comprehensive, high-fidelity corporate emissions accounting is both practical and sustainable, enabling businesses to play a pivotal role in reducing aviation climate impacts and advancing industry wide best practices.

· Sky-High Connectivity: The successful launch of Air Peace’s Lagos-London route and the return of carriers like Emirates underscore Nigeria’s expanding global reach.
The current MRO announcement is the concrete realization of a 2024 Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Nigerian government and Boeing.
That agreement, executed in Seattle by Aviation Minister Festus Keyamo, committed Boeing to providing Nigerian operators with comprehensive training, technical support, and operational assessments.
“This partnership marks a major step in modernising Nigerian airlines,” stated Minister Festus Keyamo at the time of the MoU.","In a transformative move for the continent’s aviation landscape, the Nigerian Federal Government has announced a strategic partnership with global aerospace leader Boeing and the UK’s renowned Cranfield University to develop internationally certified Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facilities on Nigerian soil. This landmark initiative, confirmed at the inaugural Nigerian International Airshow, directly targets the repatriation of an estimated $200 million annually spent by Nigerian airlines on overseas aircraft maintenance.

The Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Senator George Akume, unveiled the partnership, naming leading Nigerian operators Aero Contractors and XEJet as the local drivers of the project. New MRO hubs are already planned for the nation’s key aviation nodes: Lagos and Abuja.

This ambitious infrastructure push is not occurring in isolation. It is strategically positioned atop a platform of robust sectoral growth and sweeping modernization:

· Traffic & Revenue Surge: Nigeria’s passenger traffic hit 15.89 million in 2023, with projections soaring to 25.7 million by 2029. Annual industry revenue is expected to reach $2.58 billion.

· GDP Contributor: Aviation contributes approximately 2.5% to national GDP, supported by 20 airports, 23 active airlines, and a deepening talent pool.

· Infrastructure Revolution: A monumental ₦712 billion overhaul of Lagos’s Murtala Muhammed Airport is underway, complemented by modernization projects at five other major airports and runways nationwide.

· Regulatory Leadership: Nigeria now ranks as Africa’s leading country for compliance with international aviation safety standards.

· Sky-High Connectivity: The successful launch of Air Peace’s Lagos-London route and the return of carriers like Emirates underscore Nigeria’s expanding global reach.

The current MRO announcement is the concrete realization of a 2024 Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Nigerian government and Boeing. That agreement, executed in Seattle by Aviation Minister Festus Keyamo, committed Boeing to providing Nigerian operators with comprehensive training, technical support, and operational assessments.

Crucially, Boeing’s Airport Engineering team was tasked with advising on airport expansion and the development of local maintenance facilities—laying the direct technical groundwork for the hubs now being established.

“This partnership marks a major step in modernising Nigerian airlines,” stated Minister Festus Keyamo at the time of the MoU.

Echoing this sentiment, Boeing’s Vice-President for Commercial Sales in Africa, Anbessie Yitbarek, emphasized the deal’s role in “building a sustainable civil aviation ecosystem in Nigeria.”

The shift from advisory support to physical infrastructure represents a pivotal moment. Nigeria is now poised to become a major MRO player in West Africa, though it enters a competitive field with established hubs in the Middle East and emerging centers across the continent.

Officials, however, are confident in Nigeria’s strategic advantages: its vast domestic market, geographic position as a natural West African gateway, and rapidly expanding airline network. The scale of local fleet growth alone creates a compelling business case for in-country MRO services.

Secretary Akume highlighted Nigeria’s proactive engagement on the global stage, noting, “At the Dubai Airshow, Nigeria showcased its readiness to collaborate on next-generation aviation and defence technologies.”",https://airspace-africa.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Boeing-737-MAX-via-Boeing.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 15:58:34.079797

Speaking during a panel debate at Travel Weekly’s Sustainability Summit, Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade was confident the Revenue Certainty Mechanism (RSM) – a UK government scheme to support investment in the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) – would come into law as planned by the end of 2026.
She added: “I’m not just talking about airlines here, I’m talking about the fuel suppliers, so the oil and gas companies, which are dragging their heels on producing sustainable aviation fuel.
The airline manufacturers, so Boeing and Airbus, are also dragging their heels on developing new aircraft.
“Everybody’s dragging their heels.","Aviation and cruise sustainability experts are hopeful of progress within the sectors next year but admit delays and increased emissions are also likely.

Speaking during a panel debate at Travel Weekly’s Sustainability Summit, Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade was confident the Revenue Certainty Mechanism (RSM) – a UK government scheme to support investment in the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) – would come into law as planned by the end of 2026.

Progress would rely on “how quickly they can enrol contracts, depending upon the projects that come forward”, he said, but insisted: “There will be more momentum around RCM this time next year, and I think we’ll be much more developed in terms of our thinking and government’s thinking as well as the greenhouse gas removals market.”

Aviation Environment Federation policy manager Celeste Hicks agreed: “We’re not sure whether that means contracts being awarded at the end of next year, but that’s the idea. That will give us an indication of whether we’re going to hit the 2030 SAF targets.”

But she said she also expected to see “delay and increased international aviation emissions” over the next 12 months, and accused the industry as a whole of “dragging its heels” on the production of sustainable aviation fuel.

She added: “I’m not just talking about airlines here, I’m talking about the fuel suppliers, so the oil and gas companies, which are dragging their heels on producing sustainable aviation fuel. The airline manufacturers, so Boeing and Airbus, are also dragging their heels on developing new aircraft.

“Everybody’s dragging their heels. It’s easy for everybody to blame each other, but we don’t see the progress.”

Carnival UK vice-president sustainability and strategy Sophie Portlock was hopeful of progress in 2026 towards an International Maritime Organisation (IMO) deal to reduce carbon emissions globally to reach net zero by 2050, despite talks falling apart earlier this year.

Referring to a one year delay to a vote on adopting a global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pricing mechanism for international shipping, she said: “It will be interesting to see what happens as a result of the IMO discussions around the net zero framework.”

She stressed the deal had not been “discarded”, adding: “It’s just been delayed by a year. That vote is now due to take place in October next year, and over the coming 12 months, there is work that is going to be done to look at some of these technical challenges and how we overcome some of those within that framework.”

While cruise only makes up 2% of the international shipping industry, ensuring alignment in the move to alternative fuels was “key” to provide confidence and clarity in the market, she stressed.

Carnival Corporation had already seen an 11% reduction in its total greenhouse gasses since a peak in 2011 following investment in energy efficiency measures and new technology, despite a 38% capacity increase over the same period of time, she said.

“That shows how these initiatives and these developments are leading to a reduction in our total carbon footprint,” she said, adding Carnival Corporation had 11 ships operating on liquefied natural gas (LNG), with 18 due to have LNG by 2033, covering around a third of total passenger capacity.

She added more than 70% of the group’s fleet had shore power capability but said the challenge in Europe was the number of available ports.

“There are about 16 ports that have shore power capability that can support cruise ships of our size,” she said, but noted: “We are expecting to see a further seven ports of a shore power capability next year. So it is increasing.”",https://dcxnozgahgy2a.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/384/Tim_Alderslade_sustainability_summit1_Main.webp,N,,2025-12-08 14:56:32.576862

Then, he asked what other soil fertility factors may influence the decline in biomass yield in older stands.
“But over time, as you withdraw nitrogen by harvesting biomass, the first component to be impacted is tiller mass.
After that point, biomass yield is determined by tiller mass.","URBANA, Ill. — To meet ambitious U.S. Department of Energy targets for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), production of purpose-grown energy crops must ramp up significantly. Although researchers have made substantial progress in understanding the management and conversion of these crops, key knowledge gaps hold the industry back. Now, two new studies from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign help fill in the blanks for Miscanthus and switchgrass management.

“We have come a long way in our understanding of purpose-grown energy crops for SAF, but we still need to optimize agronomic management practices, like harvesting and nutrient management, to reduce production costs and incentivize growers,” said D.K. Lee, senior author of both studies and professor in the Department of Crop Sciences, part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences at U. of I.

Previous studies have been limited in spatial scale or focused on the first years after establishment, early in the perennial life cycle. But Lee’s group is working to provide more realistic, long-term solutions to maximize biomass productivity and grow a more sustainable fuel industry.

In the first of two recent studies, Lee’s team conducted an economic and environmental analysis of two harvest methods for switchgrass.

“Harvesting operations account for 60-80% of the total production costs for switchgrass,” said Muhammad Umer Arshad, postdoctoral researcher in Lee’s group and first author on the Bioresource Technology paper. “We wanted to understand why the harvesting cost is so high and how each operation contributes to cost, energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as identify where reductions are possible.”

Arshad explains that switchgrass harvesting can happen via the stepwise method, in which tasks like mowing, raking, baling, and roadsiding are separated into individual operations; or the integrated method, which uses different equipment to consolidate mowing and raking into one pass. Hypothetically, an integrated approach could reduce effort, energy consumption, and costs. But, after analyzing data from 125 Virginia commercial-scale sites varying in field size and biomass yield, Arshad found a more nuanced answer.

“We found that the integrated method makes more sense for smaller fields (less than 3 hectares, or 10 acres) and low-yield (less than 3.2 tons per acre) conditions, reducing GHG emissions by 9% and energy use by 5%,” Arshad said. “The stepwise method was better for large fields with high biomass yield, reducing harvesting costs to $37.70 per ton and achieving the lowest GHG emissions.”

The costs were estimated assuming the farmers are using their own machinery, tractors, and harvesting equipment.

Lee adds that the results reveal the importance of tailoring harvesting strategies to site-specific conditions and provide the first evidence-based guidance that harvest methods can improve both economic and environmental outcomes.

In a separate study published in Biomass & Bioenergy, the team tackled age-related declines in Miscanthus biomass yield, a function of tiller (stem) mass and density. These long-lived perennial grasses follow a predictable growth trajectory, including a juvenile stage that builds over several years to reach peak biomass yield, followed by a slow decline after about 10 years. Until now, it wasn’t clear which components of yield change over time and how nutrient management might help.

Postdoctoral fellow Nictor Namoi analyzed data from a long-term Miscanthus trial with nitrogen fertilization treatments that varied in amount and timing. First, he looked at how tiller mass and density changed over time and with various nitrogen treatments. Then, he asked what other soil fertility factors may influence the decline in biomass yield in older stands.

“We found that both tiller mass and density increase from the first year of establishment to the fourth year, and if you apply nitrogen, you get an increase in both factors,” Namoi said. “But over time, as you withdraw nitrogen by harvesting biomass, the first component to be impacted is tiller mass. So tiller mass is very sensitive to nitrogen management.”

Namoi adds that tiller density continues to increase until individual stands become saturated, with no more space for further expansion. After that point, biomass yield is determined by tiller mass.

He notes that the decline in biomass yield over time may not be entirely tied to nitrogen. With every harvest, soil nutrients tied up in plant biomass are removed from the system, depleting elements that play a role in photosynthetic efficiency. When Namoi analyzed soil phosphorus and potassium in mature Miscanthus stands, he found significant deficits in both essential nutrients.

“Our findings identify tiller mass as a key determinant of biomass yield in aging Miscanthus and highlight the need for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium management for long-term productivity,” he said.

Both studies provide practical guidance to increase profitability, a key factor for any producer looking to explore biomass crops.

Uganda, Congo, Rwanda and even north western Tanzania. Feasibility studies were completed, Tanzania offered Uganda a chunk of territory at Tanga to base its operations. The project was promptly forgotten.

Then came the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (Eacop) linking western Uganda to, again, Tanga. It is 75 percent complete, likely to be operational in a year. Still Ugandans as often are crying over lack of secure access to the sea contrary to international law.

When in 1976 Idi Amin mentioned Uganda’s old boundaries, official Kenya closed the borders bringing Uganda’s transport sector to a standstill. In 1987, Uganda and Kenya nearly went to war over access to the sea.

Last year, Uganda took Kenya to court over the latter’s blocking Kampala from directly importing its petroleum products then worth $2 billion a year, instead using Kenyan middlemen who we were told made the fuel pump prices twice what they should be in Uganda.

But Uganda already has its own access to the sea. It is called Eacop stupid! All it needs is an upgrade to have an electric railway running above the oil pipe, silly!

It is not an easy mission, but who said it is supposed to be easy? Remember the famous statement by US President John F. Kennedy on September 12, 1962 at Rice University, thus: “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard”.

The difference from a man walking on the moon in 1969 is that Uganda adding a trade route over an already existing oil evacuation one is even easier than the pipeline which is 75 percent done.

The complicated pipeline needs to have the crude oil electrically heated all the way along its 1,443km to keep flowing because Uganda’s raw petroleum is waxy and solid at “room” temperature.

Running an electric railway above the existing space would require examining some special technical and economic considerations by an expert-executed feasibility study like: neutralising trains’ vibrations near the pipe; economic viability and opportunities like adding decent, world class passenger travel between Uganda and the coast; and the financing model at about the same cost as the pipeline ($4 billion).

With the Hoima sports stadium construction for Afcon 2007 (Hoima is again the area where Eacop starts) being Uganda’s first infrastructure eye opener that has seen a Turkish finance and execution model build the ultramodern stadium at record speed, the secure trade route can be handled along similar arrangements.

But own finance is another option — the other day Uganda’s social security fund offered a billion dollars it has lying around to the government for a highway for which it has been begging foreign moneylenders.

A secure rail link to Tanga for Uganda over already existing land isn’t a genius suggestion considering that Ethiopia has already done an electric 755km rail link to Djibouti. But more relevantly, Tanzania is a pioneer of railway electrification in East Africa; again with Turkish participation. And, before I forget, Hoima has built a huge cargo airport that can take any size of cargo aircraft existing in the world.

Add a rail link to the Indian Ocean and an incredible modern trade network for the region would be good to go. Meanwhile Uganda’s Civil Aviation Authority is busy developing Sustainable Aviation Fuel —that is bio not fossil based, thus climate friendly — which could make Uganda bio cargo aviation.

So there is really no need to waste time asking foreign money lenders for a secure access to the sea as they will just shoot it down or cost it at several times the true price.

Upgrading Eacop to a general rail trade route would be a game-changer for East Africa, unlocking economic growth, improving regional connectivity, and enhancing competitiveness.

However, all Airbus A350 variants have an incredibly impressive range. The spread across all variants is 8,500 to 9,700 nautical miles. No range has been published for the A350-1000ULR, but it is expected to remain in the air for 22 hours.

Find out the exact ranges for each A350 variant. You can then learn more about how advanced materials and design decisions facilitate the impressive range, and how this aircraft continues to be commercially successful.

What Are The Ranges Of The A350 Variants?

A standard Airbus A350-900 has a range of 8,500 nautical miles (15,740 km). The larger A350-1000 has a longer range of 9,000 nautical miles (16,668 km). This is overtaken by the 9,700 nautical miles (17,964 km) of the A350-900ULR. To facilitate the additional fuel needed for this range, the A350-900ULR has a higher maximum takeoff weight of 322 tons. This is the same as that available on the standard A350-1000, increased to this level in October 2023.

The table below shows the ranges of the A350 variants, as far as they have currently been published:

An A350-1000ULR will be able to conduct 22-hour missions. This extra range is facilitated by adaptations that reduce seating to 238 passengers, facilitating a 20,000-liter (4,400 gallon) rear center fuel tank.

How Singapore Uses Its A350-900ULRs

In 2018, Singapore Airlines announced that it would use its A350-900ULRs, a variant exclusive to the carrier, to fly the world's longest routes in commercial aviation. The route from Singapore to Newark began on 11 October 2018, initially served three times a week. This route travels a distance of approximately 9,000nm (16,700km), with a traveling time of 18 hours and 45 minutes. Singapore Airlines’ CEO, Goh Choon Phong, said:

“Singapore Airlines has always taken pride in pushing the boundaries to provide the best possible travel convenience for our customers, and we are pleased to be leading the way with these new non-stop flights using the latest-technology, ultra-long-range Airbus A350-900ULR. The flights will offer our customers the fastest way to travel between the two cities – in great comfort, together with Singapore Airlines’ legendary service - and will help boost connectivity to and through the Singapore hub.”

Singapore has now greatly expanded the number of destinations that it serves from Singapore using the Airbus A350-900ULR. This includes New York John F Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).

The First A350-1000ULR Is Under Construction In Toulouse

Qantas' Project Sunrise, where A350s will fly further than ever before, may arrive soon as the carrier's first A350-1000ULR is already taking shape in Toulouse, where Airbus has its manufacturing facility. Qantas' Newsroom has announced that key airframe components have now all been attached. This includes the forward, center, and rear fuselage sections along with the wings, tail, and landing gear. The manufacturer then transferred the aircraft to a new hangar to have its engines and testing instruments installed. This all sets up the jet for an extensive testing program to begin in 2026.

Qantas Group Chief Executive Officer Vanessa Hudson explained the importance of the jet for Project Sunrise in Qantas Newsroom's press release: “Given Australia’s position in the world, Qantas has a long history of breaking aviation barriers. Project Sunrise will not only overcome the tyranny of distance, it will fundamentally change the way our customers travel the world. These flights will cut up to four hours off the journey and transform how people experience ultra-long-haul travel, through science-backed design to minimize jetlag and maximize wellbeing.”

Following the testing regime, Qantas expects the first 12 A350-1000ULR to be delivered in late 2026. That will allow Project Sunrise services to begin during the first half of 2027.

How Does The A350 Achieve Such Remarkable Range?

This article has displayed the exceptional range of the A350. It is a key selling point, facilitated by astonishing efficiency and enormous fuel tanks. Airbus claims that its design decisions and advancements for the aircraft make it 25% more fuel-efficient than long-haul aircraft from the previous generation.

A key reason that the aircraft is so efficient is its advanced Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines, which exclusively power the jet. The engine also produces a tremendous amount of power needed to lift the enormous amount of fuel required for ultra-long-range flights. The Trent XWB-97 engine is the most powerful Rolls-Royce engine to enter commercial operations, producing 97,000 lbf (431 kN) of thrust on takeoff. The table below features key specifications for the -84 and -87 variants of the engine according to the EASA's Type Certificate Data Sheet:

The aircraft uses a clean-sheet design. Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer fuselage and wings are featured in over half of the airframe's structure. This material has led to substantial weight reductions while maintaining the required strength. The aircraft also has high-aspect-ratio wings and modern winglets. As a result, drag is reduced while the necessary lift is maintained.

A350s Are Finding New Customers

Extensive, successful long-range operations are leading new airlines to consider bringing in the A350. In November 2024, Emirates announced that it had taken delivery of its first A350-900 at its Dubai International Airport (DXB) hub. This aircraft was the first of the carrier's orders for 65 A350s. This aircraft, registered A6-EXA, was also the first widebody aircraft of a new type to be delivered to Emirates since 2008. That year, the Middle Eastern carrier received its first-ever A380. As with many other Airbus deliveries in recent years, this delivery was powered by a blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and regular fuel. The jet entered service shortly after, flying first to Edinburgh in January 2024. The A350s were first deployed to serve nine new routes, as announced in May 2024.

Emirates expected its new A350-900s to be a game-changer, allowing the carrier to serve more destinations with better efficiency and flexibility. Adnan Kazim, the deputy president and chief commercial officer (CCO) of Emirates, said: “With the latest generation cabin products including more of our sought-after Premium Economy to more cities, top-notch in-flight entertainment technologies and an abundance of other customer-friendly features, the Emirates A350 builds on our long-standing commitment of investing in the very best customer experience in the sky.”

As of November 2025, the carrier had 13 A350-900s in its fleet, with a remaining 52 on order. The jets are currently all in a three-class configuration, totaling 312 seats. The carrier has also planned to incorporate an additional layout into its A350-900s flying the furthest. These aircraft will have just 298 seats, but an extra row of premium economy and more galley space. Not all the routes currently flown on Emirates A350s from Dubai are exclusive to that aircraft. This includes the route to Amman (A380), Dammam (777-300ER), and Kuwait City (777-300ER).

The A350 Achieves Its High Range While Being Quieter

Despite its incredibly powerful engines and the need to lift a huge amount of fuel into the sky, the A350 is an incredibly quiet aircraft. The manufacturer claims that the A350 is five decibels quieter than its competitors and aircraft from the last generation. The noise in front of the cabin is also nine decibels quieter. Compared with the Airbus A330, the A350 has a 50% lower noise footprint. Such noise reduction is essential for comfortable flying during trips that regularly exceed 10 hours, making it easier for passengers to sleep. Producing less noise also reduces the impact on communities near airports or the wildlife that lives alongside them.

A number of factors allow this aircraft to operate more quietly. Firstly, the jet's engines have a lower fan tip speed, and the engine's shape and nacelles manage airflow to reduce noise. The aircraft's aerodynamic shape also reduces drag. As drag produces noise, the shape reduces noise during flight. Finally, the cabin features soundproofing technology. Any noise that does travel from the engines to the cabin will be heavily dampened.

Reducing noise also allows airlines to operate across more hours of the day and night. Under pressure from neighboring communities, many airports have to deal with Heathrow-style restrictions that limit flying hours. Such limits can be pushed wider by quieter aircraft. Opening up more slots in this way is particularly important at the world's busiest airports.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/here-s-how-much-more-range-the-airbus-a350-1000ulr-has-compared-to-the-a350-900ulr.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-08 13:56:59.996759

Southern is a U.S.-based developer of low-cost, biomass-derived clean fuels, best known for its flagship project in Louisiana that plans to transform regional wood-waste feedstock into green methanol and carbon-negative sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on a large commercial scale. The two organizations will merge under a newly formed, U.S.-domiciled parent company that is expected to be listed on Nasdaq after fulfilling all customary closing requirements.

The new combined entity aims to play a central role in helping global aviation and maritime operators comply with increasingly stringent decarbonization mandates issued under frameworks such as ReFuelEU and by global regulatory bodies like the International Maritime Organization (IMO). By developing a fully integrated clean-fuels platform anchored in Louisiana, the company intends to use domestic resources, secure supply chains, and a local workforce to manufacture carbon-negative SAF and green methanol at competitive prices.

Under the proposed structure, the combined organization will operate through two core divisions. The first will focus on climate-oriented solutions that generate environmental assets such as carbon credits. The second division will concentrate on clean-fuel production, with its initial emphasis on the previously announced Louisiana biomass-to-fuel project. By merging DevvStream's environmental-asset expertise with Southern's biomass-conversion technology, the new company seeks to lower production costs and remove a major barrier that has slowed alternative fuel adoption across the aviation and maritime industries.

Management anticipates that by taking advantage of early federal incentives, combined with co-products generated during fuel production, the platform can ultimately achieve cost competitiveness even without government subsidies. Additionally, the company plans to leverage early engagement from airlines and maritime offtakers who are preparing to meet future carbon-reduction obligations. For investors, this strategic move signifies a transformation of DevvStream—from a smaller services-oriented company into a scalable industrial clean-fuels producer with long-term revenue visibility.

Leadership of the newly formed company is expected to be headed by Carl Stanton, who will assume the role of CEO. The organization will operate under the name Southern Energy Renewables. The transaction is currently expected to close in the first half of 2026, pending regulatory clearances and shareholder approvals.

Stanton highlighted the urgency behind the merger, noting that aviation and maritime companies face some of the most aggressive global decarbonization requirements. He emphasized that despite operators’ willingness to transition, renewable fuels remain significantly more expensive than fossil alternatives—an issue the combined platform aims to solve by pairing Southern’s low-cost feedstock and proven technology with DevvStream’s carbon-credit monetization capabilities.

Meanwhile, Chief Strategy Officer Nevin Smalls emphasized that their biomass-to-methanol-to-SAF pathway integrates proven processes and carbon capture technologies, targeting one of the lowest lifecycle carbon profiles in the market.

Southern has also agreed to an initial $2 million PIPE investment in DevvStream at $15.58 per share, reflecting confidence in DevvStream’s core business and the strategic value it brings to the merged platform. Upon closing, Southern shareholders will own roughly 70% of the combined company, while DevvStream shareholders will hold approximately 30%.

Sustainability is now central to the shift, with organisations actively integrating ESG measures into their operations.

Global logistics giant DHL has outlined some of the most effective ways for companies to boost customer satisfaction by ensuring B2B deliveries are cleaner, more efficient and more cost-effective.

Meeting demands

B2B procurement has traditionally centred on cost savings and securing the best value, but sustainability has become a leading factor in recent years. With global regulations tightening, emissions tracking across Scope 1, 2 and 3 has moved sharply into focus. As a result, more businesses are exploring sustainable shipping as a way to strengthen their competitive position and reduce supply chain impact.

Research from Bain & Company shows that 36% of B2B buyers would leave suppliers that fail to meet their sustainability expectations. A supplier’s environmental performance can determine whether a customer chooses to work with them, making informed supply chain decisions essential. As a leading logistics provider, DHL offers insight into how sustainable shipping can enhance a company’s reputation.

Only 53% of B2B customers are satisfied with the sustainable options offered by suppliers, highlighting a clear opportunity for differentiation. Large corporations often impose strict sustainability standards on their partners, meaning that offering sustainable shipping can open the door to new business. Although initial costs may be higher, sustainable shipping can reduce expenses over time, particularly through lower fuel consumption driven by energy-efficient transport.

""Even with economic pressures, both B2C and B2B customers are choosing brands that prioritise ESG goals and are sincere and transparent about their efforts,"" explains Katharina Tomoff, SVP for Global ESG at DHL Supply Chain.

A sustainable shipping strategy

B2C transactions have begun to influence the growth of B2B e-commerce, with more buyers expecting speed, convenience and sustainability.

The nature of B2B shipping means that it is very easy to implement a sustainable shipping strategy:

Shipment size and frequency: B2B shipping leans towards larger deliveries with infrequent shipping, allowing for route optimisation and reduced emissions

Delivery speed & flexibility: B2B deliveries are usually scheduled in advanced, meaning that sustainable planning can take place

Order destination: B2B consumerism makes it easier to optimise routes, reduce inefficiencies associated with last-mile delivery and consolidate shipments as orders are usually delivered to a singular location - such as warehouses or distribution centres

Achieving eco-friendly shipping

As well as having a positive environmental impact, low-emissions B2B delivery is proven to increase long-term efficiency, brand reputation and cost savings.

""E-commerce is evolving – from AI-driven personalisation and social commerce to the rise of B2B and borderless trade,"" says Pablo Ciano, CEO at DHL eCommerce.

“Businesses are scaling faster, selling smarter and prioritising sustainability like never before. At DHL, we’re proud to support this momentum, helping retailers deliver with speed, trust and responsibility in every market they serve.”

Sustainable fuels

DHL's GoGreen Plus uses sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to help businesses reduce carbon emissions, as it is produced from renewable sources like vegetable oils and waste products and can reduce GHG emissions by up to 80%. It is a good option for SMEs and e-commerce businesses with small cargo loads.

Electrifying fleets

DHL is aiming to electrify 66% of its last-mile delivery vehicles by 2030, as part of its wider plan to achieve net-zero by 2050. By partnering with an EV-focused company, businesses stand to reduce carbon from final-mile deliveries.

Locally grown Miscanthus will be used to supply small to medium-scale power plants, decentralizing the energy infrastructure and making it less vulnerable to attacks. Miscanthus will also provide raw materials for the domestic building materials sector, decreasing dependence on imports.

Supported by the UK government through its InnovateUkraine program funded by the FCDO (Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office) and UK International Development, the MERIT project will develop scalable Miscanthus supply chains and agronomic models to enable Ukraine to harness its potential for domestic biomass production while creating economic opportunities for Ukrainian farmers.

“There are two main goals of this project,” explains Florian Ilias, Terravesta managing director. “Energy system impact and socioeconomic impact. In the short term, the project enables local energy economies to flourish, using and cleaning war-contaminated land no longer fit for food production. In the long term, it supports Ukraine’s transition to a more secure, low-carbon economy.

“The project will also create jobs, sequester carbon, and restore contaminated land, as well as improving energy access and promoting social inclusion.”

The project brings together a strong international partnership. As lead partner, Terravesta is collaborating with Liverpool John Moores University as scientific partner, LLC Miscanthus Technology (Ukraine) as technology lead, and remote monitoring and agronomy partner LLC Fendt (Ukraine).

A step towards energy independence and climate resilience

“MERIT is about delivering practical support for Ukraine at a critical time,” says Florian. “By unlocking Miscanthus production, we can help Ukraine replace lost energy capacity, reduce carbon emissions, and build a secure, local biomass resource for heat and power.”

The project will demonstrate Miscanthus’s role in restoring degraded land, building climate resilience, and providing a reliable, low-input crop that supports rural communities in recovery.

Working with Ukrainian farmers and partners, the MERIT project will:

● Establish demonstration sites across various climate areas showcasing Miscanthus as a sustainable biomass source.

● Provide training, planting models, and agronomic support tailored to Ukrainian conditions.

● Assess logistics, processing, and market pathways for Miscanthus-derived bioenergy.

● Generate evidence on carbon sequestration and biodiversity benefits to inform policy frameworks and support biomass adoption.

The Space Summit 2026 will be held from Feb 2 to 3 at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre. It is officially endorsed by Singapore’s Office for Space Technology and Industry (OSTIn) and the Economic Development Board.

“The summit positions Singapore as the hub for space dialogue and collaboration in Asia-Pacific,” said Experia in its statement.

The space economy, a key topic to be discussed at the summit, is projected to reach a US$1.8 trillion value by 2035, up from US$630 billion in 2023, according to a McKinsey report from January.

The forecast value includes both “backbone” applications, such as those for satellites, launchers and services such as broadcast television or GPS, as well as “reach” applications, such as those for which space technology helps companies generate revenue.

Themed “New Frontiers: Shaping a Responsible and Inclusive Space Future”, the Space Summit 2026 will convene global policymakers, space agencies, investors and innovators to discuss topics such as infrastructure, sustainability, investment and the in-space economy.

OSTIn in August had said that Singapore can support the global space industry as a geospatial data hub, with the potential to “create high-value jobs”.

In February, it also announced plans to put S$60 million towards developing satellite technology, among other space industry moves – including a regional satellite imaging project.

That followed a Deloitte report that forecast that the increased use of earth observation data could add US$100 billion to South-east Asia’s gross domestic product by 2030.

Airbus, Boeing and Comac return

Having debuted in 2008, the main event of the Singapore Airshow 2026 will take place from Feb 3 to 8 at the Changi Exhibition Centre, with more than 1,000 participating companies spanning 50 regions.

An “expanded presence” is expected from both the Italian Trade Agency Pavilion and the China Pavilion. Other countries such as Singapore, Japan and the UK will also have country pavilions.

Europe’s Airbus, the US’ Boeing and China’s Comac will return as exhibitors, alongside more defence-focused players such as Lockheed Martin. Local companies such as SIA Engineering and ST Engineering will also be present.

While Boeing was in attendance in 2024 as an exhibitor, it chose not to display its passenger aircraft such as the 737 Max or 777X after a fuselage panel on one of its 737 Max 9s blew out mid-air at the start of the year.

A Boeing spokesperson declined to confirm if its passenger aircraft will be making a return to the Singapore Airshow in 2026. Experia Events said confirmation on static and flying displays will only be ready nearer the show date, likely to be end-January.

The US planemaker’s long-delayed 777X made an appearance at the Dubai Airshow in November – its first since the Wings India show in Hyderabad in January 2024.

The jet’s first delivery was delayed a fifth time in October, this time to 2027 from the previous 2026 target. The aircraft was originally slated to begin deliveries in 2020.

Singapore Airlines, which has 31 777X jets on order, in November said that it is not expecting a “major impact” from the delay.

Sustainable aviation fuel and net zero in focus

Sustainable aviation fuel and net-zero intiatives are also expected to be in the spotlight.

Singapore’s sustainable aviation fuel levy will kick in on Oct 1 next year for all passengers and cargo on commercial flights originating in Singapore.

It will vary by destination and class of travel for passengers, ranging from S$1 to S$10.40 for economy class, and S$4 to S$41.60 for business and first class. For cargo, the levy ranges from S$0.01 to S$0.15 per kilogram.

In October this year, Singapore also set up the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company, the world’s first non-profit to centralise the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel. Central procurement of the fuel by the company aims to give airlines operating to and from Singapore the ability to negotiate its supply as an aggregate.

At the airshow’s AeroForum, renewable fuels leader Neste will discuss the fuel’s adoption, supply chain transformation and greener aviation operations.

The AeroForum will also discuss market and budget outlooks, autonomy and human-machine teaming, cybersecurity, advanced air mobility, workforce transformation and commercialisation of next generation technologies, said Experia.

Alongside the other events will be the Changi Aviation Summit 2026, to be held on Feb 2, with senior government officials and industry leaders set to discuss “key issues” faced by the civil aviation industry.

, the last time the show was held.

The first four days of the air show, billed as Asia’s most influential aviation event, are typically reserved for trade visitors, with the final two days open to the public.

Among those who attend are high-level government and military delegations from around the world, as well as top executives from various aerospace and defence firms.

More than 1,000 companies are expected to take part in the 2026 edition, matching the scale of the 2024 show. They include industry heavyweights like aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing, as well as US defence contractor Lockheed Martin and French aerospace company Thales.

Experia Events said first-time participants in 2026 include next-generation defence technology companies like Helsing, Quantum and Shield AI.

In 2022, the Singapore Airshow had close to 600 participating companies from 39 countries.

In 2020, there were 930 participating companies from 45 countries. This was after 70 companies, or about 8 per cent of all exhibitors, pulled out at short notice over Covid-19 concerns.

Singapore Airshow 2026 will introduce a new parallel event – Space Summit 2026, held from Feb 2 to 3 at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre in Marina Bay Sands. This marks a significant expansion of the show’s scope from air to the emerging domain of space, said Experia Events, and positions Singapore as a hub for space dialogue and collaboration in the Asia-Pacific.

The summit, themed “New Frontiers: Shaping a Responsible and Inclusive Space Future”, will bring together global policymakers, space agencies, investors and innovators to discuss topics such as infrastructure, sustainability, investment and the in-space economy.

The sector is projected by McKinsey to reach US$1.8 trillion (S$2.3 trillion) by 2035.

Each Monday, we speak to someone from a different profession to discover what it's really like. This week we chat to international flight attendant Grace Hampson...

Our salary is organised into three parts... so it's hard to give a typical salary. We're paid a basic salary, flight pay and also per diems depending on where we are travelling to. [The Money team had a look at the average basic salary, and the National Careers Service says it starts at around £19,000 and goes up to £28,000 a year.]

We don't have set working hours in a week... Flight time limitations are set by the Civil Aviation Authority. They allow us to fly 900 hours in a rolling year and no more than 100 hours in a rolling 28 days. We get 28 days of holiday a year.

The training is different for every airline... If you don't already have one, you will need to obtain an attestation, which is a professional safety qualification all flight attendants need. That course can be done in a week. After that, you will need to be type-rated to a certain aircraft to learn the specifics on things like safety equipment and emergency drills. That's where the training lengths can differ.

The chance to explore is our greatest perk... Meeting diverse people and learning about different cultures is incredible. And I also love the flexible schedule that comes with long-haul flying.

One thing I wish passengers would stop doing is... asking if they can move seats as they are boarding. We are happy to accommodate and make passengers as comfortable as we possibly can during the flight, but we need all passengers to take their allocated seat for take-off. The weight and balance of the aircraft gets calculated, and that includes passengers as well as cargo and other factors. Correct weight distribution is essential for the aircraft to maintain stability and control. In short, the decision is out of the flight attendants' hands!

A lot of people call us ""waitresses in the sky""... and although part of our job is to provide excellent service, the most important thing is that we keep our passengers safe. We can deal with a large number of emergencies that have the possibility of emerging in the air, with fewer resources than you would have on the ground. It's a great responsibility, which each flight attendant has worked hard at during their career.

Every airline probably has their own version of a secret language... However, the most common secret language we use is signalling to each other throughout the cabin when we need a top-up of tea, or another serving of chicken.

In my eyes, the best time to travel is... first thing in the morning. The travel to the airport is usually easier, and early flights tend to be less expensive. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are normally the best days for cheaper flights.

My favourite airport is... Los Angeles International Airport. This may be an unpopular opinion as it holds a reputation for being crowded. Not only does it have a great shopping and dining experience, but it also has the most flights to and from other airports, meaning you can connect to some amazing places.

We follow a very strict policy when it comes to the service of alcohol on board... especially flying such a long distance. We always monitor to make sure people aren't overdoing it. We also make sure that we are looking out for people's well-being at the boarding door when it comes to alcohol consumption.

An ongoing issue with aviation is always environmental pressures... and keeping carbon footprint low where possible. Modernising fleets and using aircraft such as the 787 Dreamliner can contribute to an improvement as they are known for their fuel efficiency and lower emissions in comparison to older aircraft. The introduction of sustainable aviation fuel is going to make a great difference when it is made commercially viable to use.

My top packing tip is... rolling clothes instead of folding them. Somehow this creates more room and I can get more in. When I'm packing for a trip, I try to keep my outfits in similar colour palettes so I can rewear a pair of trousers or a cardigan and mix and match things I have bought with me.

Something surprising that people might not know is... We don't just turn the aircraft round and come home. Many passengers ask if we are going to be flying the aircraft straight home after a long-haul flight. Due to required rest, we tend to stay in a destination for a night or two before working the flight back. Another crew will be waiting at the destination for us to arrive and to take over the aircraft. They will then work the return flight.

I have never nearly been in an accident... Aviation continues to be one of the safest forms of travel. Even before I was flying for a job, my dad was a pilot and I travelled with him a lot. In total, I've had 36 years (both as a passenger and a flight attendant) without so much as a near-miss.

People trying to join the mile high club aren't a total myth but... it doesn't happen often like people think. Increased security and regular cabin patrolling make it near on impossible.

Turbulence doesn't frighten me at all... During turbulence, we are regularly doing safety checks in the cabin. We are making sure passengers are continuing to wear their seatbelts and of course checking in on their general wellbeing.

The IMF mission currently in Cairo commended the progress in investments and trade reforms in a recent meeting with the Minister of Investment and Foreign Trade, Hassan El-Khatib, noting the country’s economic strategy has become more consistent and transparent.

Egypt has made progress in its fiscal position, achieving a surplus of 2.5 percent of GDP in FY2024/2025. It also reduced its overall debt to 86 percent of GDP.

More urban planning projects are also in the pipeline, through maximizing the utilization of investment opportunities in new cities and increase private sector involvement to establish urban expansions, Madbouly explained.

NBAA is helping lead a new chapter for business aviation in Washington state by bringing together an industry coalition to address recent legislative changes and foster stronger, more collaborative relationships with state leaders and communities.

The newly formed coalition is a powerhouse of industry advocates, including state and national NBAA members, the Pacific Northwest Business Aviation Association, allied national associations, local business owners and representatives from across the business aviation industry. This broad coalition reflects a shared commitment to ensure that aviation’s contributions to Washington’s economy and communities are well understood and valued.

The group’s primary mission, for now, is to champion an industry response to Senate Bill 5801, which passed late in the last state legislative session and imposes a burdensome tax on business aircraft owners and operators, many of whom are small and medium-sized local companies.

Citing the need to raise funds for sustainability efforts, the bill’s broad scope impacts aircraft sales, use and leasing. Although the tax will not take effect until April 1, its impact is already being felt, with some businesses reconsidering their presence in Washington state.

The measure, which passed with limited industry input, has raised significant concerns for business aviation and underscored the need for a unified voice from the business aviation community.

Recognizing the need for a coordinated response, NBAA has taken the lead in forming the new coalition, with a mission to communicate business aviation’s commitment to sustainability and its essential contribution to Washington’s economy and local communities.

“Sustainability is a driving force for NBAA and the broader aviation industry, as evidenced in our 2050 net-zero emission target and advocacy for sustainable aviation fuel,” said NBAA Regional Director Phil Derner.

“This coalition is intent on communicating that commitment, while also dispelling misconceptions and highlighting aviation’s positive contributions to environmental progress,” he added. “We are here to build a constructive relationship that incentivizes and empowers our industry to be a better participant in sustainability and a better neighbor in communities throughout the state, not just in the big cities.”

The coalition is working to open lines of communication with key partners,

including the sponsor of Senate Bill 5801, state Sen. Marko Liias, who has acknowledged the need for greater industry involvement in future legislative efforts.

The coalition also recently gathered close to 100 industry and community representatives at Paine Field (PAE) to discuss aviation’s needs in Washington state and hear from state Rep. Tom Dent, leader of the state’s aviation caucus and a strong industry advocate.

“Our conversations with lawmakers have created opportunities to share the industry’s perspective, highlight the broader effects of Senate Bill 5801 and explore ways to ensure that future policies support both sustainability and economic vitality,” said Derner.

“By resetting the business aviation community’s relationship, we intend to keep legislators and the public better informed on our industry’s commitment to Washington state, its economy and its environment.”",https://nbaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BAI-March-April-2021-Member-Profile-Premier-Bone-King-Air-C90A-ramp.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 10:56:55.279887

Sustainable Aviation Fuel gives airlines a practical path to lower lifecycle emissions while preserving connectivity. The United Kingdom already hosts promising research centres and feedstock suppliers. What has been missing is a reliable domestic market signal large enough to unlock private capital. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill aims to create that signal.

How committee stage works

During committee stage every clause is read aloud and members can suggest amendments. Because peers sit without constituency pressures they often look closely at technical wording. This slow method may appear ceremonial yet it routinely spots unintended loopholes before a bill returns to the Commons.

Revenue certainty in plain language

At the heart of the proposal is a government backed counterparty that will sign long term contracts with fuel producers. Instead of subsidising every litre up front the state promises to top up revenue only when the market price falls below an agreed floor. A less obvious benefit is cheaper borrowing. Banks price risk aggressively; guaranteed minimum cash flow can reduce interest rates enough to shave millions from project costs.

Wider effects on travellers

Members have flagged potential impacts on ticket prices. Early modelling shows that even full SAF compliance by 2030 would add roughly the cost of a coffee to a short haul fare. Meanwhile airlines gain resilience against future carbon pricing.

Staying informed

Citizens can stream every debate on Parliament TV and read verbatim transcripts the same day. Written briefings from the Lords Library explain each proposed change in clear language.

Conclusion

The committee process may move deliberately, yet it is steadily building a foundation for scalable, cleaner aviation. By coupling scrutiny with an elegant revenue backstop, the Bill positions the United Kingdom to capture jobs, innovation and climate gains from homegrown fuel.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Copy-of-White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-44.svg,N,,2025-12-08 08:56:18.133055

China has also expanded airborne atmospheric monitoring in recent years through its meteorological and aviation research institutes, using dedicated research aircraft and modified transport planes to measure greenhouse gases and regional air pollution.","Japan Airlines (JAL) and its research partners said they will transfer sensors used in a government-backed atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring programme, known as CONTRAIL, to Boeing 787-9 aircraft, preserving one of the world’s longest-running airborne climate datasets as Japan retires older widebody jets and expands climate surveillance across new regions.

The programme, jointly led by the airlines and Japan’s national research institutes, has collected more than 30,000 greenhouse gas datasets from about 22,000 commercial flights over 30 years. This has formed the core of the country’s upper-atmosphere CO2 monitoring and the datasets are a critical reference for global climate modelling.

The shift follows the retirement of JAL’s Boeing 777 fleet that had previously carried the sensors, leaving only one operational aircraft earlier this year and raising concerns over potential data disruption, according to a statement by Japan’s Ministry of the Environment on 5 December.

The first modified 787-9 jet will begin observation on a JAL flight from Tokyo’s Narita airport to Frankfurt on Wednesday, after a ferry flight from Haneda earlier in the day, with four more aircraft to be converted by the end of the financial year. This restores the the total fleet carrying the sensors to five aircraft. A ferry flight is a non-commercial flight used solely to reposition an aircraft from one location to another, usually without paying passengers.

Launched in 1993 by JAL, the JAL Foundation and the Meteorological Research Institute of the Japan Meteorological Agency, and later joined by the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) and aircraft interiors maker Jamco, the project equips commercial aircraft with instruments that continuously measure atmospheric CO2 and collect air samples of methane and nitrous oxide at near-stratospheric cruising altitudes.

The system consists of a continuous CO2 analyser capable of running for up to two months and an automatic sampler that collects 12 air samples per round trip, both developed by Jamco and already fitted to the first 787-9 plane.

Data collected are released publicly via NIES servers, and Japan now holds one of the world’s largest upper-atmosphere CO2 datasets, with more than 10,000 observations over Narita, 1,700 over Bangkok and 1,500 over Sydney alone.

Scientists of the project say the aircraft sensors offer continuous, high-frequency, wide-area and vertical measurements which are unavailable from ground stations or satellites, allowing researchers to track how emissions move across hemispheres and how agricultural cycles, forest fires and industrial activity shape atmospheric composition.

The upgraded fleet will extend monitoring deeper into the southern hemisphere via Melbourne, closer to the Arctic through Frankfurt routes, and for the first time into the Middle East via Doha, while also resuming observations over India through Delhi, where crop cycles have already been shown to influence seasonal CO2 fluctuations. Researchers previously detected emissions spikes over Singapore during Indonesia’s 2015 forest fires comparable to Japan’s annual national output.

“Through atmospheric observation using next-generation aircraft, we will continue to track changes in greenhouse gas absorption and emissions at both the global scale and across major metropolitan areas, while also using the data to verify the effectiveness of emissions-reduction measures,” said the ministry.

Japan’s programme operates alongside a smaller number of comparable efforts overseas. In Europe, a government-backed research infrastructure known as In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS), equips selected long-haul aircraft operated by carriers including Lufthansa, Air France, China Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Iberia with atmospheric monitoring instruments.

Building on the Measurement of Ozone and Water Vapour by Airbus In-Service Aircraft (MOZAIC) programme launched in 1994, designed to measure the composition of the atmosphere using commercial passenger aircraft during routine flights, and formalised in 2011, IAGOS measures ozone, carbon monoxide and water vapour on every equipped flight, with optional modules adding greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, as well as aerosols and cloud particles. Data are used in evaluating European climate and air-quality models and in studies cited by the IPCC.

China has also expanded airborne atmospheric monitoring in recent years through its meteorological and aviation research institutes, using dedicated research aircraft and modified transport planes to measure greenhouse gases and regional air pollution.

This development expands the intellectual property protection of CPTech’s breakthrough technology, which is a key component of the company’s Plastics-to-SAF (P2SAF) programme.

The newly granted patents add to the UK patent that was first awarded in 2022, increasing the global reach of CPTech’s proprietary method for converting low-grade, highly variable pyrolysis oils into ultra-low sulphur fuels and circular petrochemical feedstocks. This technology improves stability, reduces impurities, and allows for more efficient downstream upgrading.

CPTech’s multi-stage upgrading process, which includes fractional condensation, tailored hydrotreating, and precision distillation, was originally developed for ultra-low sulphur diesel, naphtha, and marine fuels. It is now a central enabling technology within the P2SAF programme, allowing CPTech to transform mixed waste plastics into an ultra-clean product suitable for further refining into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This approach was recently showcased by CPTech CEO Dr. Andrew Odjo at the SAF Global Summit, where he presented the UK’s first Plastics-to-SAF pathway to over 500 policymakers, airlines, and industry leaders.

Dr. Odjo stated, “The fundamentals matter. Reliable, consistent upgrading of plastic-derived oils is essential if we are to diversify SAF feedstocks. Securing these patents strengthens our ability to scale this work globally.”

The timing of the patents aligns with a surge in momentum for CPTech, as the company recently announced the arrival of equipment for its first P2SAF pilot facility, set to be commissioned in Q1 2026. This will be the first real-world demonstration of the SAFe-P2SAF platform, marking the transition of the technology from stage-presentation to steel-in-the-ground deployment.

With UK and EU SAF mandates coming into force, increasing pressure on bio-based feedstock supply chains, and growing airline commitments to decarbonisation, alternative circular feedstocks such as waste plastics are gaining strategic importance.

By securing patent protection in two major energy markets – the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia – CPTech is positioning itself to license, develop, and protect its technology across jurisdictions that are central to global fuel production.

CPTech’s patented process addresses long-standing challenges associated with raw pyrolysis oil, which is typically unstable, oxygen-rich, metal-laden, and unsuitable for use in refineries or engines without extensive upgrading. By increasing stability, controlling variability, and removing sulphur, nitrogen, and other contaminants, the technology produces a cleaner, more predictable intermediate oil – exactly what is required for advanced aviation-grade upgrading.

Dr. Odjo commented, “This patent was never just about improving diesel. It was about unlocking a pathway for waste plastics to become genuinely circular. Today, that pathway leads directly into SAF.”

With further announcements expected later this year, the expanded patent protection sends a clear signal: CPTech is not only innovating in the lab and on the stage – it is securing the legal and commercial underpinnings needed to scale plastics-to-fuel production globally.

Dr. Katerina Garyfalou, COO of Clean Planet Technologies, stated, “Turning difficult waste into strategic low-carbon fuels requires more than good science. It demands certainty, protection, and the ability to scale with confidence. These patents help us do exactly that.”

Clean Planet Technologies (CPTech) is a subsidiary of the Clean Planet Group, dedicated to developing proprietary technologies that enable the sustainable use of plastics and the reduction of carbon emissions.

Row-crop producers across the South faced another difficult year in 2025. Weather challenges led to wide yield variability across much of the region. Even where yields were strong, low commodity prices and persistently high input costs kept margins tight, leaving many operations near or below breakeven for a third straight year. Shifts in acreage were common, with corn gaining ground at the expense of cotton and, in some areas, soybeans.

Financial stress remains a major concern heading into 2026, as limited storage capacity, tighter credit conditions and low prices continue to pressure farm profits. To capture conditions across the south, we asked Extension agricultural economists in each state to provide a brief summary of the 2025 season. Their state-by-state perspectives are below.

Arkansas: Ryan Loy, Hunter Biram and Scott Stiles, University of Arkansas

Arkansas row crop producers entered the 2025 crop year in one of the most financially challenging environments of the past decade, as crop receipts fell by $465 million to $4.46 billion, marking the third consecutive annual decline.

Corn led the downturn with a 31% year-over-year decline, followed by soybean and rice receipts, while cotton receipts remain soft due to acreage reductions. At the same time, production expenses remain elevated relative to historical averages, with fertilizer, seed, labor and interest costs continuing to pressure operating margins.

Across all principal crops, state-average net returns are projected to be negative, with breakeven prices and yields often 30%-40% above expected levels; late planting from generational flooding in April further increased downside risk. Record ad hoc assistance through ECAP (Emergency Commodity Assistance Program) and SDRP (Supplemental Disaster Relief Program) is expected to exceed $1 billion and offset a portion of these losses. However, net farm income for the crop sector is still projected to remain negative even after accounting for program payments.

The mounting financial strain facing Arkansas producers continues as they confront low commodity prices, persistently high input costs and tighter credit conditions.

Kentucky: Grant Gardner, University of Kentucky

Three consecutive years of lower prices have already put Kentucky producers in a difficult position, and this year’s extreme yield variability is adding even more pressure. Some areas will post record yields, while others will fall well below average — especially soybeans, which are currently rated in the worst condition of any state.

A major concern right now is the lack of soybeans in storage. At harvest, many producers moved beans rather than storing them due to uncertainty surrounding the trade dispute, leaving most available storage filled with corn. That decision removed the opportunity to take advantage of last month’s rally in soybean futures, and many producers were unable to benefit from the price improvement when it finally arrived.

While diversified operations with livestock may still be close to breakeven, row crop-focused farms are likely hovering at or below breakeven for the third consecutive year, tightening cash reserves and leaving many operations increasingly vulnerable to financial stress or potential default.

Louisiana: Michael Deliberto, Louisiana State University

In Louisiana, corn acres increased by 330,000 acres (+75%) from 2024 to 2025. Most producers favored corn over cotton (and, to a lesser extent, soybeans) due to grain price competitiveness. Overall, yields were near the previous four-year average of 176 bushels per acre. Prices are finally becoming somewhat favorable for producers who elected to store their crop.

Like most of the Midsouth region, cotton acres in Louisiana were down year-over-year. Producers planted only 90,000 acres in 2025. Despite the low acreage, yields were at record highs at 1,314 pounds per acre, nearly a 250-pound-per-acre increase from the previous year. While yields were excellent, prices remained low. The high cost of production, coupled with the narrow price movement within the 66-68 cents per pound range in the spring, was a main factor behind the reduced acreage in the state.

Soybean acres in Louisiana were down year-over-year. Acreage for the oilseed is typically between 1.1 million and 1.2 million acres. However, the 2025 acreage was 790,000, mainly due to lackluster prices and trade uncertainty surrounding exports. Yields were the highest in five years, coming in at 54 bushels per acre.

Rice acres in Louisiana totaled 482,000 planted acres in 2025, the most since 2010. The yield per acre was 6,650 pounds, which is on par with the five-year average. High production costs and decreasing rice prices at harvest presented a major challenge for rice growers heading into the winter.

Mississippi: Will Maples, Mississippi State University

Weather played a major role in Mississippi’s 2025 crop. Frequent heavy rains delayed planting for many producers, and late-summer drought stressed crops, resulting in significant yield variability across the state. Soybeans remained the largest crop at 1.8 million acres, but growers shifted more toward corn than cotton, planting 900,000 acres of corn compared with 330,000 acres of cotton. Financial conditions remain difficult.

The price environment is still unfavorable, and because Mississippi producers harvest early and lack the storage capacity common in other states, many were unable to capitalize on the recent soybean price rally. High production costs continue to squeeze margins, leaving most producers facing negative profits for the third consecutive year. Looking ahead to 2026, a growing number of producers have expressed equity concerns as they evaluate their farm financing options.

Tennessee: Aaron Smith, University of Tennessee

In Tennessee, 2025 row production was highly variable. Drought during July and August reduced yields and contributed to a second consecutive season of losses for many corn, soybean and cotton farmers. Cotton and soybean yields were hardest hit by the drought and will likely result in further downward revisions from current USDA yield estimates.

High input costs, low commodity prices and below trend yields resulted in per-acre losses between $100 and $250 for many producers. Before crop insurance and other government payments, Tennessee corn, cotton, soybean and wheat farmers are projected to lose over $400 million in 2025. With substantial year-over-year losses, many producers will carry operating debt over into the next season for the second straight year.

Obtaining credit for the 2026 crop will be challenging for many producers without ad hoc government payments. Canola acres in Tennessee and Kentucky continued to expand in the fall of 2025, providing producers with an alternative to more traditional double-cropping systems. Growth in canola acreage has been driven by contracted acres, primarily in northwest Tennessee, to support a pilot program to produce sustainable aviation fuel.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt93a8d80d9bb5e1a9/6930741129b53052e7704fac/1208M1-4082A-1800x1013_copy.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-08 04:56:50.158837

With Russia’s President Vladimir Putin arrived in India for the 23rd India–Russia Annual Summit.

Expectations were high that major defense announcements—especially on the S-400 Triumf air defense system and Su-57 stealth fighter—might finally materialize. However, while the summit delivered momentum and clarity, it stopped short of sealing any new big-ticket deals.

A Focused Summit: Deepening Strategic Dialogue, Not Signing Deals

The high-level talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Putin emphasized continuity, cooperation, and calibrated modernization of India’s defense capabilities. India stressed its push for self-reliance (Atmanirbhar Bharat) in advanced aerospace systems, while Russia highlighted its readiness for technology transfer and localized production, including proposals linked to the Su-57.

But as anticipated by analysts, India chose a measured approach—accelerating discussions without committing to new purchases.

S-400: India Wants More, Russia Offers Faster Delivery—but No New Contract Yet

India reiterated strong interest in expanding its S-400 inventory, especially after the system proved decisive during Operation Sindoor (May 2025), where India used the platform to conduct 300+ km precision intercepts against Pakistani assets.

S-400 Triumf: Key Features (embedded into article)

Range: 40–400 km depending on missile variant

Targets: aircraft, drones, cruise missiles, ballistic threats

Radars: multi-layered phased array surveillance and tracking

Engagement: up to 80 targets simultaneously

Missiles: 48N6, 40N6 long-range interceptors

Outcome of Discussions

India proposed five more regiments and additional long-range missiles.

Russia offered up to 50% technology transfer and local production in India.

Russia assured completion of pending deliveries (two regiments) by FY 2026–27.

Talks on S-500 and Pantsir systems were held, but remain exploratory.

For now, the focus is on timely delivery—not new contracts.

Su-57: Russia Pushes Hard, India Stays Cautious

Russia made a renewed proposal for India to acquire the Su-57E export variant, along with a pathway to local manufacturing through HAL. This included a possible two-seat variant tailored for India and full technology transfer covering engines, radars, and stealth materials.

Su-57 Stealth Fighter: Key Features (embedded into article)

5th-gen design: low RCS shaping, composite airframe

Engines: “Izdeliye 30” (future) offering supercruise capability

Avionics: AESA radar, IRST, sensor fusion

Weapons: R-77M, Kinzhal derivatives, hypersonic-capable bays

Role: air superiority + deep strike + electronic attack

India’s Strategic Calculus: Partnerships, Not Dependency

The summit’s outcome matches India’s “multi-alignment” strategy:

Russia remains India’s largest arms supplier (36% from 2020–24).

India is expanding ties with the U.S. (MH-60R, GE engines) and France (Rafale M).

Sanctions and Ukraine-related production delays force India to diversify.

Outside defense, the two leaders signed 20+ MoUs on trade, energy, labor mobility, and nuclear cooperation.

Looking Ahead: Decisions Expected in 2026

India is expected to finalize:

New missile procurement under the 2026 defense budget

S-400 support infrastructure and MRO setup in India

Possible conditional movement on Su-57 by mid-2026, depending on AMCA timelines

Social media reactions echoed the expert consensus:

“No big-ticket deals, but strong strategic continuity.”

Conclusion

No new contracts were signed—but both nations reinforced the defense relationship’s depth. India continues to strengthen deterrence while waiting for the right moment to commit to next-generation platforms.",https://i0.wp.com/jetlinemarvel.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sukhoi_Design_Bureau_054_Sukhoi_Su-57_49581303977-e1690730325106.jpg?resize=960%2C600&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-08 04:57:29.534381

Australia risks missing its environmental targets if it fails to win greater investment from China and should change its policies to avoid being left behind other nations.

Reforms should include more transparency about foreign investment decisions, clean energy advocates have recommended, and a “green lane fast track” for strategic renewable energy investments.

Think tank Climate Energy Finance issued the warnings on Monday in a report analysing China’s growing global investments in zero-emissions technology such as solar panels, batteries, hydro-electricity and green hydrogen.

It comes days after the Australian Energy Market Commission revealed electricity prices were expected to fall in the next five years but could rise in 2035 if renewable energy investments did not meet expectations.

Climate Energy Finance’s report, called Rising Tide, analysed China’s clean technology investments during the past three years.

It found Chinese companies have committed more than $US180 billion ($A271 billion) to energy projects such as wind and solar developments since 2023, adding $US100 billion of investment in just one year.

Notable investments include an industrial park producing green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel in Brazil, a hydro-electricity project in Peru, and battery gigafactories in Spain and France.

But Chinese spending in Australia has collapsed, the report found, with outbound direct investment accounting for 1.5 per cent of the nation’s total, down by 85 per cent since 2018.

The low investment rate was particularly troubling, China analyst and report author Caroline Wang said, given 70 per cent of Australia’s clean energy investments come from overseas.

“Australia stands at a critical juncture,” she said.

“Not engaging with China’s capital and expertise will delay Australia’s net-zero transition, putting at risk its decarbonisation goals and future prosperity in a net-zero global economy.”

The group issued five recommendations to boost Chinese investment in Australian projects, including a framework and working group to establish co-operation, an advisory group to issue recommendations, and foreign investment policy reforms, including a fast-track for renewable energy projects.

Without changes, Australia could struggle to meet its 2035 climate target to reduce emissions between 62 and 70 per cent, Ms Wang said.

“A multipolar world, no longer centred on the US … necessitates an urgent overhaul of its economic, foreign investment and foreign policy settings,” she said.

“This means strategically working with China or being left behind in the new world order.”

Taking a sensible, managed approach to allowing Chinese investment in energy projects would be the key to the industry’s success, Ember senior energy analyst Muyi Yang said.

“Almost everyone agrees you can’t hit climate goals without working with China but once co-operation moves to actually making clean products together, worries about over-reliance and de-risking suddenly grow louder,” he said.

“The real challenge isn’t to cut China out, it’s to build more diversified, resilient supply chains that still tap into China’s know-how while helping other countries grow their own clean industries.”",https://i0.wp.com/citynewsqbn.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/20250318124721122363-original-1-scaled-e1765146687430.jpg?fit=900%2C600&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-08 04:57:35.664379

Strong community From the moment Elkadi stepped into the role of CEO, he could appreciate the strong company culture.
From the CEO of Los Angeles International Airport to the CEO of San Diego International Airport, they all have this vast experience that I love to tap into and pick their brain on different ideas,"" he says.
It’s hard to think of another business with such a large supplier and partner base as an international airport.
""Ontario International Airport proves what’s possible when the governing board and leadership team lead with collaboration, accountability and shared vision.","Atif Elkadi began working in the aviation industry almost by accident. In mid-2008, he moved with his family to Dubai, ready to take on the role of brand manager for a theme park company.

Then the global financial crisis hit.

Fortunately for Elkadi, he was able to pivot into airports, something that still surprises him.

""I never thought I would ever work in an airport,"" he admits, revealing that his experience until that point had mostly been in advertising.

His skills turned out to be transferable, however, and he worked at Dubai Airports for the next four years before deciding it was time to return to the United States. Another four years at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport followed, before Elkadi spotted an opening at Ontario International Airport (ONT).

""I grew up in Northern California and I always knew I wanted to come back to California at some point,"" says Elkadi, now CEO at ONT.

Strong community

From the moment Elkadi stepped into the role of CEO, he could appreciate the strong company culture.

""The first thing I noticed was the pride and the commitment from the community for the airport and for its growth. It’s powerful,"" he says.

""For me, it was like, ‘This is exactly where I want to raise my family. This is where I want to be. I want to be a part of this.’""

He acknowledges that part of this comes down to the attitude of the board and its willingness to encourage new ideas. And under the slogan ‘So Cal. So Easy.’, ONT hopes to showcase its focus on convenience, accessibility and top-tier customer service.

Partners with organizations to build strategic plans, strengthen team communication and create cultures that perform with integrity, innovation and confidence.

With an emphasis on ensuring passengers can move from curbside to gate as quickly and enjoyably as possible, Elkadi wants to keep a human touch across the experience.

""We really serve one of the fastest-growing regions in the country,"" he points out. ""Our area, called the ‘Inland Empire’, is projected to add about a million people over the next 20–25 years. And that growth, coupled with a very diverse economy, really positions us as both a community hub and a global gateway.""

After returning to local ownership in 2016, airport governance is now guided by a board deeply invested in the region’s future, focusing on the needs of the local community.

As Elkadi says, ""We are an airport for the community, and that’s what we’re here for.""

Green gateway

That community connection has also driven the airport’s commitment to sustainability.

""In California, sustainability is a very popular word,"" Elkadi explains.

As such, sustainability isn’t an empty buzzword, but a core part of its operations. Sustainability considerations are discussed in virtually every area of the airport, becoming an integral factor when planning everything from power supplies to EV infrastructure.

Elkadi reveals that collaboration with airlines and cargo partners to reduce emissions has resulted in ONT expanding its infrastructure for EV charging and investing in electric trucks.

""We use a lot of recycled material in our runway projects, as well as having advanced stormwater systems that recharge the groundwater. We also offer support for sustainable aviation fuel adoption and investment in greener infrastructure,"" he notes.

A central challenge in achieving sustainability goals is having the right support infrastructure in place from a power perspective. But thanks to long-standing partnerships with airports in California around green initiatives, real environmental benefits are possible.

""I would say all of us who lead airports in California probably have the biggest challenge in the country because in California, the demands are a little bit more than in other states. So we work together to ensure we can do that,"" he explains.

Elkadi meets quarterly with airport directors and CEOs across California to exchange ideas and best practices.

""These are really, really smart and talented people. From the CEO of Los Angeles International Airport to the CEO of San Diego International Airport, they all have this vast experience that I love to tap into and pick their brain on different ideas,"" he says.

""We all have our own distinct challenges in our individual airports, but when it comes to sustainability and environmental issues, we talk about how they’re handling it, what they’re doing that worked, what didn’t work, so that we can all work together.""

Essential partnerships

Partnerships extend beyond links between airports. On the first day of the job at ONT, board members made it clear to Elkadi how valuable solid relationships are at every level of the organization.

""They said, ‘It’s not about the transaction, it’s about building the relationship and sustaining it,’"" Elkadi remembers. ""I’ll never forget it, and that’s really been our motto moving forward.""

It’s hard to think of another business with such a large supplier and partner base as an international airport. From global logistics firms, including Amazon and UPS, to local police and fire departments and the United States Customs and Border Protection, Elkadi is deeply involved with their regional leadership teams to ensure all organizations are working from the same playbook.

""It’s extremely important to have open dialogue about the relationship we have with all of our partners,"" he adds.

Getting to a place where communication is seamless and based on trust isn’t an overnight process. Thanks to the work put in by Elkadi in building these relationships, when something comes up that needs to be addressed, it is easy to get to the bottom of any issues.

""We can have a quick conversation and make a fix pretty quickly as opposed to if it were transactional and you needed to go through multiple layers, so those relationships play a very critical role in our success,"" he confirms.

Southern California-based consulting firm Jacob Green & Associates works closely with Elkadi and the wider leadership team on strategic planning, risk assessments and emergency response, helping to ensure these diverse collaborations are seamlessly carried out.

In the aviation space, where small issues can rapidly escalate, having access to trusted external partners can make a crucial difference in times of crisis.

Bold mindset

Rather than focusing on innovation for innovation’s sake, Elkadi wholeheartedly believes that improved security, safety and efficiency must be the end goal, as opposed to vanity metrics.

""It’s everybody’s responsibility. The way our organization works is that with every idea, it doesn’t matter what position you’re in, bring it forward and let’s see if we can make it happen,"" he says.

Based on the ambitious ONT Bold development plan, the entire airport is committed to transforming how people think about the airport’s role.

""It’s not just a transportation hub, but a platform for connection, innovation and resilience,"" Elkadi explains.

The ONT Bold plan has now become a mindset held by employees that guides how they approach all parts of their jobs.

During his tenure, Elkadi has doubled down on strengthening what ONT does best: creating an enjoyable customer experience. For example, a US$90 million Federal Aviation Administration-supported project to rehabilitate runways, including enhanced safety, adding lighting, modernizing electrical systems and installing sustainable stormwater management was one of the first initiatives led by Elkadi.

""It’s not necessarily sexy, but it’s very important. We’re currently expanding our Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoint lanes, which means we’re going to make our already short wait times even shorter,"" he reveals. ""And then our ongoing collaboration with TSA includes a new global entry enrollment center.""

Before the new global entry enrollment center, travelers would have to visit airports in San Diego, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Tucson or other areas just to do their global entry interviews. Now, this five-to-10-minute interview can take place at ONT, further streamlining the experience.

""My vision is that when the world arrives in Southern California, whether it’s for the Olympics, business travel or to visit family, ONT will be their most welcoming, efficient and human experience that they’ve had at an airport,"" Elkadi concludes.

""Ontario International Airport proves what’s possible when the governing board and leadership team lead with collaboration, accountability and shared vision. This alignment has built a culture that delivers results passengers can feel. Partnering with the airport reinforces why we do this work, helping organizations turn great teams into extraordinary ones."" – Jacob Green, President & CEO, Jacob Green & Associates",https://static.theceomagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/08084640/AtifElkadi_OIA_Sharing.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 00:57:45.589393

Triveni’s Sinha said that to produce 80 tonne of SAF, 200 kilo litres of ethanol is required on a daily basis.
Unless there is a clear SAF blend policy and OMCs enter into a long-term agreement, investors may not invest in it, he added.
He also said that there could be 1950-2050 crore litres of additional demand for ethanol generated, including about 100 crore litres from 5 per cent blending with aviation fuel.
CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) allows airlines claim credits for lower lifecycle emissions after blending SAF with jet fuel, and the binding phase starts from 2027.","Without a policy on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which could ensure a guaranteed buy back of the biofuel when produced, the plan to emerge as a global producer of SAF has not progressed even as some sugar companies such as Triveni Engineering & Industries, TruAlt Bioenergy, and Godavari Biorefineries are seriously exploring to set up facilities in India, particularly after it kicked off in the US recently.

Triveni’s CEO Sameer Sinha confirmed the move, and is hopeful of a SAF policy roll out before end of current fiscal. Sources in TruAlt Bioenergy, a Nirani Sugars group company, though confirmed that the company is exploring options in this new sector, but declined to share further details. “We have no such plans as of now. However we are not closed to the idea and we keep eyes on the development in this area,” said a spokesperson of Godavari Biorefineries.

US company LanzaJet, a subsidiary of LanzaTech Global, a leader in industrial carbon recycling, announced last month operationalisation and commencement of SAF production at its facility in Georgia, marking as the world’s first commercial production of jet fuel using ethanol as a feedstock. Earlier, used cooking oils were the main feedstock to produce SAF and it was not that successful, so far.

Industry sources said that for a greenfield project of about 25,000 tonne annual capacity SAF plant will require an investment of Rs 1400-1600 crore and will take three and half years to start operation.

Triveni’s Sinha said that to produce 80 tonne of SAF, 200 kilo litres of ethanol is required on a daily basis. He said the industry expects a policy roll out in this fiscal, which will provide the necessary foundation for setting up plants.

“Either the airlines have to purchase or the oil marketing companies (OMCs) need to buy SAF from the producers at a government-set rate, similar to the ethanol blending with petrol (EBP) programme. However, the government should fully control the SAF sector to make it sustainable, particularly before allowing plants to come up,” an industry expert said.

SAF is highly promising business but at the same time it highly capital intensive, said Ravi Gupta , chairman of sugar bioenergy group in the Indian Federation of Green Energy (IFGE). Unless there is a clear SAF blend policy and OMCs enter into a long-term agreement, investors may not invest in it, he added.

Currently, the ethanol manufacturers are at a quandary after creating capacities of over 1,900 crore litres whereas the OMCs consented to buy only 1,048 crore litres during 2025-26 supply year (November-October).

At a recent media briefing, Deepak Ballani, director general of Indian Sugar and Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA), had said: “After meeting the alcohol and other industrial demand for 330 crore litres, there will still be unutilised capacity of more than 450 crore litres.” Ballani had also said that while the sugar mills have about 900 crore litres capacity, they have been allotted only 289 crore litres of ethanol in cycle 1 tender by OMCs.

He also said that there could be 1950-2050 crore litres of additional demand for ethanol generated, including about 100 crore litres from 5 per cent blending with aviation fuel.

International Civil Aviation Organisation has already adopted a vision to reduce CO2 emissions in international aviation by 5 per cent by 2030 through cleaner energies like use of SAF and it requires using 23 million tonnes of cleaner fuel.

CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) allows airlines claim credits for lower lifecycle emissions after blending SAF with jet fuel, and the binding phase starts from 2027. India has already declared to achieve 1 per cent blending by 2027, 5 per cent by 2030.

Southern mendapatkan alokasi obligasi senilai $402 juta dari Louisiana Community Community Development Authority untuk mendukung fasilitas biomass-to-fuel andalannya.

Southern melakukan Investasi Swasta dalam Ekuitas Publik (PIPE) pertama pada DevvStream sekitar $2 juta dengan harga $15,58 per lembar saham

Sacramento, Calif. & New Orleans--(ANTARA/Business Wire)-- DevvStream Corp. (Nasdaq: DEVS) (“DevvStream”) adalah perusahaan terkemuka di bidang pengelolaan karbon dan monetisasi aset lingkungan, sedangkan Southern Energy Renewables Inc. (“Southern”) adalah produsen asal AS di bidang bahan bakar berbiaya rendah yang terbuat dari biomassa. Proyek unggulan Southern di Louisiana berencana memanfaatkan biomassa limbah kayu regional untuk menghasilkan metanol hijau dan Bahan Bakar Penerbangan Berkelanjutan (“SAF”) negatif karbon dalam skala besar. Hari ini kedua perusahaan mengumumkan penandatanganan perjanjian definitif untuk bergabung di bawah perusahaan baru yang berdomisili di AS dan terdaftar di Nasdaq, dengan mematuhi ketentuan penutupan yang lazim.

Perusahaan baru ini berencana membantu perusahaan penerbangan dan maritim untuk memenuhi permintaan global yang semakin ketat akibat peraturan seperti ReFuelEU dan organisasi seperti Organisasi Maritim Internasional (“IMO”) dengan cara menciptakan platform bahan bakar bersih terintegrasi buatan AS yang berpusat di Louisiana, menggunakan bahan baku dan tenaga kerja dalam negeri untuk memproduksi SAF negatif karbon dan metanol hijau dalam skala komersial. Pengoperasian perusahaan gabungan ini diperkirakan melibatkan dua divisi: divisi pertama berfokus pada solusi iklim yang menghasilkan aset lingkungan, sedangkan divisi kedua berfokus pada bahan bakar dan produk bersih, dengan fokus awal pada fasilitas biomass‑to‑fuel di Louisiana sebagaimana diumumkan sebelumnya.

Perpaduan antara jalur SAF di platform baru dan kemampuan DevvStream di bidang aset lingkungan bertujuan mengurangi beban biaya yang memperlambat penggunaan bahan bakar alternatif saat ini. Manajemen berharap dapat memanfaatkan insentif federal sejak awal selagi menargetkan daya saing biaya meskipun tanpa insentif ini, dan didukung oleh berbagai produk sampingan yang dihasilkan selama proses SAF. Perusahaan juga berencana memanfaatkan keterlibatan perusahaan penerbangan dan maritim sejak awal. Bagi investor, profil DevvStream berubah dari layanan micro‑cap menjadi bisnis bahan bakar dan kredit industri yang dapat dibiayai dengan potensi pendapatan dan skalabilitas jangka panjang. Perusahaan baru yang akan dipimpin oleh Carl Stanton sebagai CEO ini akan beroperasi dengan nama Southern Energy Renewables. Penyelesaian penggabungan bisnis diperkirakan akan dilakukan pada paruh pertama tahun 2026.

""Perusahaan penerbangan dan maritim menghadapi beberapa permintaan dekarbonisasi yang paling ambisius di dunia, dan sebagian besar ingin mematuhinya,” kata Carl Stanton, Pimpinan DevvStream. “Namun pilihan bahan bakar terbarukan saat ini masih jauh lebih mahal dibanding bahan bakar fosil sehingga memperlambat penggunaan dan menyebabkan hambatan praktik untuk bertransisi dengan kecepatan yang diharapkan oleh regulator. Merger ini berperan penting karena tujuan perpaduan antara teknologi, bahan baku berbiaya rendah, dan platform pengembangan milik Southern dengan kemampuan DevvStream di bidang aset lingkungan adalah untuk mengurangi beban biaya tersebut dan memungkinkan kepatuhan dalam skala besar.""

""Negara Bagian Louisiana tetap menjadi mitra penting dalam pengembangan inisiatif ini, dan kami harap Louisiana akan terus mendukung proyek ini selanjutnya,"" kata Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer Southern Energy Renewables. ""Kami yakin, perpaduan ketersediaan bahan baku, infrastruktur logistik, dan tenaga kerja berpengalaman di Louisiana menciptakan landasan yang kuat untuk menghasilkan daya saing jangka panjang. Kami harap dapat memperluas kemitraan dengan Lousiana selagi kami berupaya memperkuat kepemimpinan energi nasional dan memasok pasar global dengan cara yang mendukung perekonomian kita yang sedang berkembang.""

""Rencana kami dibuat untuk menyediakan bahan bakar bersih dalam skala industri dengan keunggulan biaya yang sangat jelas guna menciptakan platform canggih yang dapat bersaing secara efektif dengan Tiongkok dan seluruh dunia,"" kata Nevin Smalls, Chief Strategy Officer Southern Energy Renewables.

This report highlights the scale of private capital already underpinning Ireland’s infrastructure and the urgent need to unlock further capital to meet national priorities, many of which were outlined in last week’s Accelerating Infrastructure Taskforce Report.

""Investment in essential enabling infrastructure- be it energy, telecoms, transport, health, environmental, or other critical services-often led by the private sector,"" Fergal O’Brien, Ibec's Executive Director of Lobbying and Influence, said.

""If these companies were absent or unable to secure new investment, these projects simply would not happen.""

The report gives the example of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the requirement for which is expected to cost Ireland €2.85bn by 2050. Ireland is capable of domestic production and exports, but Ibec said that without government intervention, it is unlikely that private investors will assume the high cost and risk associated with early SAF industrialisation.

“So far, we’ve collected about 160,000 tons of UCO,” Mekky said, enough to power the first phase of production.
The company aims to produce 120,000 tons of SAF annually in its initial rollout—a cleaner-burning alternative that blends with conventional jet fuel.
“We’re creating value from waste—fuel that meets international aviation standards.” In 2024, Petrochemicals Holding established Egypt Sustainable Aviation Fuel, a venture 85% owned by state firms and 15% by private sector partners.
“We’ve developed a strategy with the Ministry of Petroleum to produce up to 1 million tons of SAF by 2050,” Mekky said.","Egypt’s state-run Petrochemicals Holding Company has signed a deal with US industrial giant Honeywell to license technology that will enable the conversion of used cooking oil into Sustainable Aviation Fuel/SAF.

Speaking to Al Manassa, company chairperson Ibrahim Mekky said one of the project’s greatest strengths is the availability of feedstock inside Egypt—namely, the enormous volumes of cooking oil discarded daily by households and restaurants.

“So far, we’ve collected about 160,000 tons of UCO,” Mekky said, enough to power the first phase of production. The company aims to produce 120,000 tons of SAF annually in its initial rollout—a cleaner-burning alternative that blends with conventional jet fuel.

Globally, UCO is priced between $700 and $1,000 per ton, while SAF can exceed $3,000 per ton. “Most Egyptians throw used oil in the trash,” Mekky said. “We’re creating value from waste—fuel that meets international aviation standards.”

In 2024, Petrochemicals Holding established Egypt Sustainable Aviation Fuel, a venture 85% owned by state firms and 15% by private sector partners. The initiative supports Egypt’s pledge to the European Union to gradually cut aviation emissions.

Mekky said the company plans to scale SAF blending ratios in local aviation fuel from 2% between 2026–2030, to 5% by 2035, and over 10% by 2040.

SAF production remains limited globally. While some countries extract it from agricultural waste like rice straw and palm residues, Mekky argued that UCO is far more cost-effective. “The most important thing is securing the feedstock—and we’ve got more than we need.”

Honeywell has developed more than 27 SAF plants worldwide, many of which are still under construction, he added.

Foreign investment eyes Egypt's clean fuel pivot

According to Mekky, the project has drawn strong interest from foreign investors, who see Egypt not just as a market—but a regional supplier.

The company’s upcoming general assembly will announce new partners, including South Korea’s GS, with other applications under review, such as energy group OAPEC. “There’s a lot of appetite from investors to join,” he said.

ESAF aims to fully meet EgyptAir’s future SAF demand and export surplus volumes abroad. “We’ve developed a strategy with the Ministry of Petroleum to produce up to 1 million tons of SAF by 2050,” Mekky said. “Egypt will become a Middle East hub for clean jet fuel.”

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development backed the early phase with a $100 million feasibility study and grant, and is expected to lead fundraising for the remaining $570 million needed.",https://manassa.news/sites/default/files/styles/facebook/public/photobank/2025/26028360-19da-4d13-bbb1-a94725e5b031.png?h=feb5a2b9&itok=bUQs_NCY,N,,2025-12-08 00:57:50.340633

The Challenge: Turning a widespread resource into reliable energy Agricultural waste is everywhere, but that does not make it easy to work with.
Brightmark Energy Core Innovation: Specializes in anaerobic digestion to convert dairy manure and other organic waste into renewable natural gas (RNG).
While starting with fermentation ethanol, it can process any bioethanol source, including that derived from agricultural waste.
Wrapping Up The transformation of agricultural waste into clean energy represents a significant frontier in the fight against climate change and the pursuit of energy independence.","The push to decarbonize the world’s energy systems now overlaps with a long standing problem: what to do with the massive amount of agricultural waste produced every year.

Billions of tons of crop residues and animal waste are generated across the globe. Much of it is left to rot or is burned, which adds to air pollution and releases methane.

The result is a two sided problem.

We face avoidable environmental damage on one side, and a large source of unused energy on the other.

A growing group of startups is working to change this. They are building practical technologies that convert agricultural waste into clean energy that farmers and rural communities can actually use.

These companies are cutting waste, lowering emissions, and supporting local economies. They are also helping build a circular bioeconomy that treats waste as a resource rather than a burden.

The Challenge: Turning a widespread resource into reliable energy

Agricultural waste is everywhere, but that does not make it easy to work with. It varies widely in quality, it is often wet, and it is scattered across many small farms.

These factors make collection and conversion costly and complex.

For decades, the most common options have been burning the waste, letting it break down in fields, or using it for low value purposes.

The real challenge is to convert this scattered biomass into dependable energy, whether biogas, biofuels, biochar, or syngas, and to do it in a way that supports food production rather than competes with it.

The date traces back to the signing of the Chicago Convention in 1944, the agreement that created the International Civil Aviation Organization and reshaped how nations cooperate in the skies.

The origin and purpose of International Civil Aviation Day

International Civil Aviation Day was formally proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1996. However, the International Civil Aviation Organization had already begun marking the occasion in 1994, aligning it with the 50th anniversary of the Chicago Convention.

The purpose of the day is clear. It highlights how international air transport supports economic growth, social development, and global connectivity. It also reinforces the central role of ICAO in coordinating safe, secure, and sustainable aviation across borders.

The Chicago Convention and its global impact

The Convention on International Civil Aviation, commonly called the Chicago Convention, was signed on December 7, 1944, in Chicago by 52 states. It entered into force on April 4, 1947, following its 26th ratification, the same day ICAO officially came into existence.

The convention established the legal and technical foundation for international aviation. It defined national sovereignty over airspace, set principles for international air services, and created uniform rules for safety, security, navigation, and aircraft operations.

Over time, the convention has been amended eight times to reflect changes in technology and aviation practices.

As of March 2019, 193 states were parties to the convention, representing near universal global participation in a shared aviation system.

Core principles enshrined in the convention

Several key articles of the Chicago Convention continue to shape global aviation today. Every state holds complete sovereignty over the airspace above its territory.

States are prohibited from using weapons against civil aircraft in flight. Clear rules govern scheduled international air services, customs landings, entry procedures, and aircraft inspections.

The convention also standardizes requirements for aircraft documentation, crew licensing, radio communications, and the mutual recognition of certificates issued by other states, provided they meet agreed international standards. These provisions ensure predictability, safety, and fairness across international operations.

ICAO annexes and global aviation standards

The convention is supported by nineteen annexes containing Standards and Recommended Practices.

These annexes cover nearly every aspect of civil aviation, including personnel licensing, rules of the air, meteorology, aircraft operations, airworthiness, air traffic services, accident investigation, aviation security, and environmental protection.

Environmental provisions, such as aircraft noise standards, engine emissions limits, and the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, reflect the sector’s growing focus on sustainability. The annexes are regularly updated to keep pace with operational and technological change.

International Civil Aviation Day in the modern era

International Civil Aviation Day now aligns closely with broader United Nations goals, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Aviation is recognized as a critical enabler of trade, tourism, humanitarian assistance, and international cooperation.

Every five years, ICAO marks milestone anniversaries with a dedicated global theme.

December 7, 2024, marked the 80th anniversary of the Chicago Convention, celebrating eight decades of coordinated international aviation and reaffirming commitments to safety, innovation, and environmental responsibility.

Looking ahead at aviation’s future

ICAO’s Strategic Plan for 2026 to 2050 outlines a long-term vision as global air traffic is projected to reach 12.4 billion passengers by mid-century. The plan emphasizes safety, security, economic viability, operational efficiency, and environmental sustainability.

Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and unmanned aircraft systems are expected to play an increasing role. ICAO supports these developments through flexible regulatory approaches that encourage innovation while preserving global harmonization.

International Civil Aviation Day remains a reminder that global aviation functions because nations choose cooperation over fragmentation, guided by principles first set down in Chicago more than eighty years ago.

From booming ethanol orders to brewery expansion, everything seemed perfectly aligned for its next phase of growth, until the rally reversed and the share collapsed over 60 percent, leaving the market stunned. But what exactly triggered this dramatic slide, and can the company stage a strong comeback?

About The Company

Praj Industries Ltd., founded in 1983, is a global biotechnology and engineering company offering sustainable solutions across bioenergy, water treatment, process equipment, breweries, and wastewater management.

The business focuses on environment-friendly, energy-efficient, and farm-to-fuel technologies. It has a market capitalization of Rs. 5,752 crore, and the stock is currently trading at around Rs. 313.

The company has built a strong global presence with more than 1000 customer references in over 100 countries across all six continents. Its innovation strength comes from a team of over 90 technologists, more than 400 patent filings, and a portfolio of 24 Indian and 60 international granted patents. Praj is also known for its TEMPO framework, which covers technology, engineering, manufacturing, project management, and operations and maintenance.

Its manufacturing capabilities are supported by five world-class plants located in Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Karnataka, all strategically positioned near ports and backed by a multi-disciplinary engineering team. The company operates international offices in Thailand, Philippines, and Houston, USA.

As of Q2FY26, the company reported an order book of Rs. 4,419 crore and order intake of Rs. 813 crore. Export revenue contributed 46 percent during the quarter. Within overall revenues, bioenergy accounted for 64 percent, the engineering business for 26 percent, and the high-purity solutions (PHS) segment for 10 percent.

Business Segments

The company has three revenue contributing business segment:

1. The Bio-Energy segment, contributing nearly 62 percent of Praj Industries’ revenue, is anchored by its Bio-Mobility platform, which develops renewable, carbon-neutral fuels for road, air and marine transportation.

Praj has a long-standing leadership in first-generation ethanol technology, offering multi-feed and multi-product plant solutions, upgrades for existing distilleries, and co-product optimisation. Its technology converts sugarcane juice, molasses and grain-based feedstocks into bioethanol, along with value-added outputs such as Distillers’ Corn Oil and rice proteins.

The company’s Bio Products and Services business supports ethanol plants through specialised microbial formulations, enzyme-based solutions and operations and maintenance services, while also providing carbon recovery technologies for process industries.

In second-generation ethanol, Praj offers its proprietary Enfinity technology and, through its partnership with Sekab in Sweden, Celluniti for ethanol production from softwood and forest residues. These technologies can process a wide range of agricultural residues including rice straw, wheat straw, bagasse, corn stover, corn cobs, softwood and empty fruit bunches. They are currently being deployed at three commercial-scale bio-refineries in India, highlighting clear commercial traction.

Praj has also commercialised RenGas, its renewable natural gas technology that produces compressed biogas from agricultural residues and press mud at approximately 30 percent lower operating costs due to specialised microbial cultures. It also generates organic manure as a by-product and produces high-purity methane. An additional bio-bitumen module offers a new revenue opportunity, with applications in road construction.

In sustainable aviation fuel, Praj’s partnership with Gevo enables SAF production using renewable iso-butanol derived from sugars, starch and biomass. The company is also expanding into marine biofuels made from certified lignin-based feedstocks, an area gaining interest from global shipping companies.

2. The High Purity Solutions segment contributes 11 percent of Praj Industries’ revenue and is led by HiPurity Systems Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary that provides end-to-end solutions for high-purity water to the pharma, biotech, and wellness industries. With over 450 installations globally, the company serves sectors including cosmetics, food and beverage, and nutraceuticals that follow compendial water quality norms. It has launched its ‘Glacier Blue’ COLD WFI brand, enabling clients to achieve up to 90 percent reduction in carbon footprint while supplying Water for Injection to both India and developed markets such as the US.

The Modular Process Systems business offers engineered solutions for biopharma, sterile formulations, and topical and oral products, providing in-house vessel manufacturing, orbital welding, system integration, and testing to help clients achieve faster time-to-market.

The Value-Added Services division supplies specialised products like ozone systems and combi test kits, provides on-site services such as electro-polishing, training, and riboflavin testing, and offers spares and consumables including membranes, chemicals, tubes, fittings, valves, instruments, and pumps.

3. The Engineering Businesses segment accounts for 27 percent of Praj Industries’ revenue and encompasses several key offerings. The Critical Process Equipment and Modularization division supplies static equipment such as pressure vessels, reactors, heat exchangers, and columns, as well as modular process skids and packages. It manages end-to-end projects, providing design support including finite element analysis, process and thermal design, piping design and stress analysis, and software-based skid design using Plant 4D and PDMS, serving industries such as oil and gas, refineries, petrochemicals, and fertilizers.

Praj GenX delivers large-scale modules to external technology partners in traditional energy, energy transition, and climate action, covering technologies like hydrogen electrolysers, waste-to-energy solutions, torrefaction, and carbon capture.

The wastewater treatment (ZLD) business offers integrated, energy-efficient effluent recycling and zero-liquid-discharge solutions, optimising both footprint and operating costs for even the most challenging wastewater streams.

The brewery and beverages division, established in 1994, provides customised plants, equipment, and technology solutions for breweries, offering world-class facilities that minimise water and energy usage and reduce carbon footprint. With over 70 percent market share in India and installations in Africa and Southeast Asia, this division delivers end-to-end support from conceptualisation and design to engineering, installation, and commissioning.

Current Scenario

On a quarter-on-quarter basis, sales increased from Rs. 640 crore to Rs. 842 crore, marking a growth of 31.56 percent. Operating profit rose from Rs. 31 crore to Rs. 56 crore, an expansion of 80.65 percent, while PBT improved from Rs. 10 crore to Rs. 30 crore, registering a 200 percent rise. Net profit increased from Rs. 5 crore to Rs. 19 crore, delivering strong growth of 280 percent. The operating margin improved from 5 percent to 7 percent.

On a year-on-year basis, sales increased from Rs. 816 crore to Rs. 842 crore, a modest growth of 3.19 percent. Operating profit declined from Rs. 86 crore to Rs. 56 crore, a reduction of 34.88 percent, while PBT dropped from Rs. 74 crore to Rs. 30 crore, a decline of 59.46 percent. Net profit fell from Rs. 54 crore to Rs. 19 crore, decreasing by 64.81 percent. The operating margin moderated from 11 percent to 7 percent.

The stock jumped from Rs. 43.55 on 25 March 2020 to Rs. 874 on 1 January 2025, giving investors huge returns of about 1907 percent. But after this strong run, the share began to fall sharply and is now around Rs. 313.55, which means it has dropped nearly 64 percent in less than a year. During the same period, the company’s trailing twelve-month profit growth has also slipped by about 62 percent, showing a clear slowdown in its recent performance.

What Went Wrong?

The company has been impacted by a sudden slowdown in ethanol demand largely due to oversupply. The rapid government push for E20 compliance was previously a major growth driver, but the target was achieved much earlier than expected, leading to a sharp drop in new greenfield ethanol plant orders and delays in ongoing projects.

There have also been concerns in the market about E20 causing issues in vehicles, although the government has clarified that no such problems exist. Future growth could revive once the roadmap for the E30 target becomes clear, but until then, the outlook remains uncertain.

Global factors have added further pressure. Tariffs and a broader slowdown in clean energy investments in the US caused several ethanol and low-carbon fuel projects to be deferred, with customers delaying their investment decisions.

As a result, the order pipeline moved much slower than anticipated. At the same time, the GenX facility has been running at very low utilisation while carrying high fixed costs, although the management has said that GenX orders are gradually returning.

Many energy-transition projects the company had earlier pursued have either stalled or remain on hold. Based on its assessment, the company expects clarity on these projects to take more time and has started reshaping its strategy by targeting a wider customer base across different industries, with a stronger focus on opportunities in oil and gas, piping, structures, and conventional energy markets.

Execution timelines have also lengthened because several customers are facing funding challenges. Many projects are struggling to reach financial closure as lenders are carrying out tighter scrutiny, and project developers are required to bring in a higher equity contribution. This has delayed debt arrangements, slowing down execution cycles.

The company clarified that the issue is not with collections but with customers’ funding arrangements taking longer than before. A few projects that were stuck due to financing issues have recently achieved closure and have begun moving into execution during the quarter.

Cost pressures added to the weakness. Other expenses rose compared to last year due to higher execution activity, and under-absorption of fixed costs at the GenX facility further weighed on EBITDA. The facility’s fixed cost is around Rs. 8.5-9 crore per month, and while there was some absorption this quarter, it remained limited because execution is still at a very small scale due to minimal order booking.

The effective tax rate also increased to 35 percent in Q2FY26 and 37 percent for H1FY26, as the deferred tax asset being created on GenX losses is recognised at a lower rate than Praj Industries’ usual tax rate.

Future Growth Drivers

Shift Toward Lifecycle Services and Brownfield Opportunities

Praj Industries said that while new greenfield ethanol projects are slowing, the company is now shifting its attention to lifecycle services and brownfield opportunities across its existing installed base. This includes work such as plant upgrades, improving efficiency, and adding new co-products to already running facilities.

Global Bioenergy Momentum and Low-Carbon Ethanol Projects

On the international bioenergy side, the company highlighted a steady flow of inquiries from the US for low-carbon ethanol projects that will benefit from 45Z tax credits. Praj is currently executing its first low-carbon ethanol project in the US, which is expected to be commissioned by the end of this financial year. In Latin America, countries like Panama and Argentina are moving towards higher blending mandates, while Indonesia has already introduced a 10 percent mandate. Vietnam plans to move to E20 by 2026, and many African nations are also preparing to introduce or expand ethanol blending requirements.

Growing Pipeline in the Compressed Biogas Segment

In the compressed biogas segment, Praj has begun work on its first Napier Grass-based project. The company is seeing strong inquiry levels for projects based on Napier Grass and press mud. However, the wider market is expected to scale up once India’s national gas grid and its connectivity improve further. The service business continues to grow with strong order inflows for performance enhancers, related solutions, and biogenic CO2 capture technologies.

Breakthrough in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

In the sustainable aviation fuel segment, the alcohol-to-jet demo plant at Praj Matrix is now operational and has successfully produced SAF from ethanol. This facility is the world’s first integrated alcohol-to-jet fuel demo plant and is expected to boost customer confidence in both the technology and commercial-scale investment decisions.

Recovery Signs in Brewery and PHS Businesses

The brewery division is seeing early signs of revival, especially in greenfield markets driven by rising demand. In the PHS business, there is growing traction for high-capacity fermenters, complex injectable systems, and blood plasma solutions. New opportunities are also emerging in high-purity water requirements for storage batteries, electric vehicles, solar cells, and semiconductors.

High-Purity Water Opportunities Across New-Age Sectors

For ultra-pure water, Praj noted that new sectors such as semiconductors, solar panel manufacturing, and battery production are opening up in India. These industries require high-purity water at a different scale compared to pharma, but the underlying technology is similar. The company plans to leverage its strong pharma expertise to expand into these new high-growth markets.

Large Opportunity Emerging in Diesel Blending Trials

Praj also mentioned that trials with oil marketing companies and agencies like ARAI are being planned for diesel blending. Once the results are validated, it could unlock significant opportunities, especially because diesel consumption in India is 2-3.5x higher than petrol due to heavy transport usage. This opportunity could potentially be larger than the E20 ethanol blending programme.

CIP Dispatches Expected to Ease Working Capital Pressure

Management added that dispatches under the Contracts-in-Progress (CIP) category should start moving out by December or January. They expect this to ease the temporary working capital blockage seen this quarter, and operating cash flows should improve as these dispatches roll out over the next two to three months.

Once blended with conventional jet fuel, SAF is a drop-in solution that meets ASTM D1655 specifications and performs to the same standards as traditional jet fuel—requiring no changes to aircraft, fuel infrastructure or handling procedures.","Million Air Austin (KAUS) and Avfuel Corporation came together to boost sustainable aviation operations at Austin Bergstrom International Airport with the addition of sustainable aviation fuel. The SAF—which went into service on November 20, 2025—provides a meaningful solution for operators seeking to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from flight operations. This marks the first SAF location in Texas for both companies, offering a consistent supply of SAF specifically for the airport’s business and general aviation traffic.

Roger Woolsey, CEO of Million Air Interlink commented: “Austin is a thriving, business-centric city that also deeply values environmental responsibility. Bringing SAF to Million Air Austin is about giving our customers meaningful options that align with both their travel needs and their sustainability goals. At Million Air, we believe sophistication and responsibility go hand-in-hand, and this step in our Beyond Green initiative reflects our commitment to making choices that support both our customers and our planet.”

Mark Haynes, Avfuel’s vice president of sales stated: “The Million Air team has been an exceptional partner to work with in expanding sustainable fuel solutions. We’re proud to collaborate with them to establish our first consistent SAF-supplied location in Texas and help further their corporate initiatives on sustainability.”

The SAF, originating in Texas, has a targeted blend percentage of 30% neat SAF to 70% traditional jet fuel. For every 8,000-gallon truckload of fuel, the SAF provides a 19 metric ton reduction in carbon emissions over the fuel’s lifecycle compared to petroleum-based jet fuel. This is equivalent to the amount of carbon sequestered by 19.1 acres of U.S. forests per year. In its neat (pre-blended) form, SAF has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

This initiative is part of Million Air’s Beyond Green sustainability program—a company-wide commitment to responsible aviation practices. The Beyond Green platform focuses on integrating more sustainable solutions across Million Air’s network, from renewable energy investments and facility efficiencies to greener fuel options, like SAF.

The EU's Sustainable Transport Investment Plan has launched the eSAF Early Movers Coalition pilot project, aiming to mobilise at least €500 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects. This ambition has been overfulfilled! On 4 December, alongside the announcement of the third auction of the European Hydrogen Bank, the EU successfully united eight Member States - Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain - to accelerate the production and uptake of synthetic aviation fuels (eSAF). The funds will be used to finance H2Global-style double-sided auctions in 2026, designed to provide producers with stable long-term revenue and buyers with competitive short-term contracts. This initiative aims to give the sector the necessary boost to bring eSAF projects to Final Investment Decision (FID) and address calls to weaken or abandon the eSAF sub-quota. When designing the auction tender, it should be open for Methanol-to-Jet (MtJ) proposals. MtJ is expected to earn its ASTM approval in mid-2026. This versatile eSAF production process combines cost-effective sourcing of green methanol in countries with optimal production conditions and synthesizes jet fuel at an industrial scale plant in Europe. Hence MtJ sits between two positions: ""Europe-only to strengthen our technological base"" and ""imports only to get the cheapest price.""

The European Union has committed a €3 billion investment package to accelerate the commercial production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This public capital immediately de-risks the energy and chemical supply chain by providing a financial bridge to overcome the high initial capital expenditure for new production facilities, particularly those using the Power-to-Liquid (e-fuel) pathway. The funding is a direct policy-to-market intervention designed to ensure the industry can meet the binding regulatory requirement of a 70% SAF blending mandate by 2050.

Context

The core question for the aviation and energy sectors has been: Can the industry meet its aggressive fuel mandates without a massive public capital infusion to bridge the cost and production gap? The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation created a clear demand signal, but the high capital expenditure for new plants and the cost premium of SAF over conventional jet fuel stalled the necessary private investment. Informed professionals were waiting for a mechanism to convert this policy risk into commercial certainty.

Analysis

This development is a direct response to the binding ReFuelEU mandate, which created a future demand that the current supply chain cannot meet. The €3 billion funding acts as the necessary mechanism to build that supply. Manufacturers are now expected to accelerate Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) on new SAF plants, especially those focused on synthetic e-fuels.

Think of this funding like a government-backed insurance policy for the first wave of new factories, guaranteeing that the high initial cost will not lead to stranded assets. This policy incentive causes private capital to flow, accelerating the industrial build-out.

Outlook

This development implies that the Power-to-Liquid pathway is now a commercially validated option for industrial decarbonization in aviation. The simple thing to watch next is the announcement of Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) for large-scale SAF production facilities. A sustained flow of FIDs, secured by new, long-term offtake agreements between airlines and SAF producers, will confirm that the public capital has successfully de-risked the market and that the industrial build-out is now in motion.",https://news.sustainability-directory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Decarbonized-Urban-Mobility-Electric-Tramway-Biophilic-Design-Sustainable-Infrastructure.jpeg,N,,2025-12-07 17:56:43.177255

For travelers, COP30 marks the beginning of a new era of sustainable tourism. As the industry takes climate action seriously, the benefits for tourists are clear. From more eco-friendly flights to sustainable hotel stays, travelers can expect to see a shift toward greener options in their travel choices. While these changes may initially come with higher costs, the long-term impact on the environment and local communities will be invaluable.

The tourism sector’s increased focus on sustainability means that travelers will have more opportunities to contribute positively to the planet. Tourists who choose airlines and hotels that prioritize green initiatives are directly supporting the fight against climate change. For example, passengers flying with Delta Airlines can feel confident that their flight is part of the airline’s broader sustainability efforts, as it continues to integrate sustainable aviation fuels and improve fuel efficiency. Similarly, tourists booking a stay with Hilton can enjoy the peace of mind that their accommodation is committed to minimizing its environmental footprint.

Travel Tips: How to Choose Sustainable Travel Options

As a tourist, there are several ways to ensure that your travel choices align with the principles of sustainability set out at COP30. Here are some practical tips for eco-conscious travelers:

Choose Airlines Committed to Sustainability: Opt for airlines like Delta, which are making significant strides in reducing emissions and adopting sustainable aviation fuels. Look for airlines that offer carbon offset programs or have a clear roadmap toward achieving net-zero emissions.

Select Hotels with Green Certifications: Look for hotels like Hilton that have made sustainability a cornerstone of their operations. Hilton’s Travel with Purpose program is an excellent example of how major hotel chains are reducing their environmental impact while supporting local communities.

Embrace Eco-Friendly Destinations: Many countries and regions are embracing sustainable tourism. Spain, for example, has made significant efforts to integrate sustainability into its tourism industry, with a focus on nature conservation and eco-tourism. Similarly, Brazil’s tourism sector is focused on promoting eco-friendly experiences, particularly in its vast rainforests and biodiversity-rich regions.

Use Public Transport: When exploring a destination, opt for public transportation, which is often more eco-friendly than private cars. Many cities are expanding their networks of electric buses and trains, reducing the carbon footprint of travel within urban areas.

Support Local, Sustainable Tourism: By choosing locally-owned businesses that emphasize sustainability, tourists can help foster community development while reducing their overall environmental impact. Small, eco-conscious hotels and restaurants often have a much smaller carbon footprint than large multinational chains.

The Role of Spain and Brazil in Shaping Future Travel Trends

Spain, a leading European destination, has long been a proponent of sustainable tourism. Its focus on preserving cultural heritage and protecting natural landscapes aligns well with the goals of COP30. In cities like Barcelona and Madrid, sustainability is a key focus, with initiatives designed to promote eco-friendly tourism and reduce the environmental impact of large tourist populations. Spain is also focusing on enhancing its tourism infrastructure to accommodate the growing demand for sustainable travel, including expanding the use of renewable energy and water-saving technologies in hotels and resorts.

Brazil, the host of COP30, has positioned itself as a champion of sustainable tourism, particularly in its vast and biodiverse Amazon rainforest. The country’s tourism sector is shifting toward ecotourism, which encourages travelers to explore Brazil’s natural beauty while minimizing environmental impact. Brazil is also working to ensure that local communities benefit from tourism, creating jobs and supporting conservation efforts.

As these countries continue to integrate sustainability into their tourism industries, they will inspire other nations to follow suit. Tourists visiting these destinations will have the opportunity to experience a new era of travel—one that is environmentally responsible, culturally rich, and focused on preserving the world’s natural wonders for future generations.

Flight Details: Sustainable Travel Options for Tourists

For travelers flying to Spain, Brazil, or the United States, there are several sustainable travel options to consider. Delta Airlines, one of the leading airlines in the United States, is committed to making air travel more sustainable. With flights from major cities such as New York, Atlanta, and Los Angeles to destinations across the globe, Delta is leading the way in sustainable aviation practices. Delta’s carbon offset program allows passengers to offset their flight emissions, and the airline continues to invest in sustainable aviation fuel to reduce its carbon footprint.

Spain’s flagship airline, Iberia, has also committed to reducing its environmental impact. Iberia has been working to enhance fuel efficiency and reduce emissions across its fleet. Additionally, Iberia offers a carbon offset program, allowing passengers to contribute to climate action by offsetting the emissions from their flights. Iberia operates flights to and from major cities such as Madrid, Barcelona, and Seville, providing travelers with a sustainable travel option when visiting Spain.

In Brazil, major airlines like LATAM are also embracing sustainability. LATAM has set ambitious targets to reduce emissions and has implemented various sustainability initiatives, including investing in modern, fuel-efficient aircraft. The airline operates flights to key destinations within Brazil, such as Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Brasília, providing sustainable travel options for tourists exploring Brazil’s vibrant cities and natural wonders.

Hilton’s Sustainable Stays: What Tourists Can Expect

For travelers looking for eco-friendly accommodations, Hilton is leading the way with its sustainability efforts. Hilton’s Travel with Purpose program is focused on reducing the company’s carbon footprint, increasing energy efficiency, and promoting sustainability across its global portfolio. Hilton hotels are adopting green building standards, incorporating renewable energy sources, and offering guests the option to participate in sustainability programs during their stay. For example, Hilton properties in Spain, Brazil, and the United States are equipped with energy-efficient lighting, water-saving fixtures, and waste reduction systems.

Tourists staying at Hilton hotels can expect a range of sustainable options, from locally sourced food to green cleaning products. The company is also working to ensure that its hotels are integrated into the local community, providing economic benefits while supporting conservation efforts. Hilton’s commitment to sustainability ensures that travelers can enjoy their stay with the peace of mind that they are supporting a company that values environmental responsibility.

The Future of Travel: A Greener, More Resilient Industry

As COP30 has shown, the tourism sector is on the cusp of a major transformation. With the commitment of airlines, hotels, and destinations around the world, travelers can expect a future where sustainable tourism is the norm, not the exception. From green flights to eco-conscious hotels, the tourism industry is rapidly evolving to meet the demands of a climate-conscious world.

Travelers today have the power to make a difference by choosing sustainable options and supporting companies that prioritize the environment. With airlines like Delta and hotels like Hilton leading the charge, the future of travel looks brighter than ever—greener, more responsible, and more aligned with the needs of the planet.

Analysts have trimmed their average price target on Honeywell International by about $2, to roughly $239. This reflects modestly higher revenue growth assumptions but slightly lower fair value and profit margin expectations following recent model updates around the Solstice spin and Q3 results.

Analyst Commentary

Street research remains broadly constructive on Honeywell, with most recent notes highlighting upside from portfolio moves and execution improvements, even as some estimates and price targets are nudged lower to reflect the Solstice separation and updated Q3 assumptions.

Bullish Takeaways

Bullish analysts see the company entering a breakup catalyst rich phase. The Solstice spin and portfolio simplification are viewed as creating a clearer roadmap to value unlock and supporting sum of the parts upside.

Several notes point to solid Q3 performance and growing momentum across core segments. This supports confidence in management execution and underpins higher price targets in the mid 250s range.

The recent Quantinuum fundraise at a higher valuation reinforces the perceived hidden value of Honeywell's strategic stakes and adds roughly mid single digit dollars per share to some sum of the parts frameworks.

Stripping out Solstice is viewed as enhancing the quality and stability of the remaining industrial and automation earnings base. This could justify a premium multiple if execution stays on track.

Bearish Takeaways

Bearish analysts are trimming price targets in the low to mid 240s range as they reset models for the loss of Solstice earnings. This modestly reduces near term EPS power and fair value estimates.

Some caution that the timing and magnitude of value realization from Quantinuum is uncertain, with a potential IPO now seen slipping toward 2026. This delays monetization and may cap near term rerating.

There is concern that guidance updates to account for fewer months of Solstice contribution and balance sheet payment transfers could create short term noise around reported growth and margins.

A subset of more cautious views emphasizes that, despite portfolio catalysts, execution still needs to remain consistently strong across all segments to justify current premium valuation levels.
