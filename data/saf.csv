That means we have to rely on sustainable aviation fuels,” she said.
How can we support a sustainable aviation revolution?” Dodd said the technology existed for a transition to sustainable fuel sources.
… The more sustainable aviation fuel we require, the more that price difference is going to hurt you,” Feenstra said.","A German breakthrough in producing carbon-neutral aviation fuel at an industrial scale is providing fresh hope in the battle to reduce aviation’s carbon emissions.

But experts say it could be a while before these “eco-fuels” or “e-fuels” – synthetic aviation fuels produced from fossil-free electricity and recycled carbon dioxide – can be a major way to make aviation sustainable.

How to fly green

“There’s a collection of sectors such as aviation, long-distance maritime shipping, chemical industry, steel production – making these sectors sustainable is not as easy as for other sectors, where you can just directly apply electrification,” chemical engineer Maartje Feenstra said.

Feenstra, a senior research consultant at the University of Sydney’s Institute for Sustainable Futures, said batteries were not viable technical solutions for airplanes.

“They don’t provide the right energy density. So that means that for aviation, we have a limited amount of technical possibilities for the energy transition. That means we have to rely on sustainable aviation fuels,” she said.

University of Adelaide researcher Tracey Dodd, a global expert on energy policy, said the aviation industry was lobbying for the right policy environments for sustainable fuels.

“But even with the best projections, it’s only going to be 0.7 per cent of fuel globally,” she said.

“That’s a drop in the ocean. How can we support a sustainable aviation revolution?”

Dodd said the technology existed for a transition to sustainable fuel sources.

“There are several synthetic biofuels that can be used in existing aircraft, meaning there is no need to change the aircraft. Algae also has significant potential, but it is more expensive as the feedstock can be used for other purposes, such as pharmaceutical products. Additionally, scientists are exploring new pathways, including hydrogen and carbon-neutral synthetic fuels,” she said.

“Every day we have a new innovation. The problem is scaling it up.”

What is sustainably produced aviation fuel?

The European Union roadmap for sustainable aviation fuels requires them to make up 2 per cent of European supply by 2025, rising to 6 per cent in 2030 and reaching 70 per cent by 2050.

“The aviation sector, in particular, will rely on sustainably produced kerosene for the time being,” said Roland Dittmeyer from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany.

“Synthetic fuels that are produced by means of power-to-liquid processes with carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or biogenic sources, water, and green electricity are particularly suitable.”

Dittmeyer is the spokesperson for the Kopernikus P2X project, which announced advances in sustainable fuel production in March.

KIT, and industrial partner Sunfire, said it had used water vapour and CO2 co-electrolysis technology to produce synthetic kerosene at a scale that could be used industrially.

“It’s nice to see this technology scaling up and getting sort of demonstration volumes,” said Feenstra, who is not involved in Kopernikus P2X.

Sunfire and KIT say it’s a world first. Their “syngas” – a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide that are converted into long-chain hydrocarbons called “syncrude” – has a 220-kilowatt (kW) output.

A Boeing 777’s twin-jet engines have a total power output of about 130,000kW.

“Co-electrolysis stands out, in that it is a highly efficient process that electrochemically converts water vapour and CO2 directly into syngas in a single step,” said Sunfire senior engineer Hubertus Richter.

“Up to 85 per cent of the electrical energy used for this process can be recovered as chemical energy in the syngas.”

Richter said Sunfire could also demonstrate that coupling the process with its co-electrolysis method meant a very high plant availability and reliability – and could potentially produce syngas with the desired quality at any time.

“This eliminates the traditionally separate hydrogen production process with downstream syngas production, significantly increasing the efficiency of the overall process,” he said.

Feenstra helps illustrate Kopernikus P2X’s output another way: “With a daily production of 300 litres of syncrude, it would still take 796 days (over two years) to fill up a Boeing 747-400. For the next envisioned production of a tonne a day, it would still take slightly over half a year to fill up a Boeing 747-400.”

So there’s some way to go yet.

A problem of soaring costs

“The challenge for the aviation industry is that the renewable fuels are more expensive than the normal fuel set. … The more sustainable aviation fuel we require, the more that price difference is going to hurt you,” Feenstra said.

“If we want to make aviation sustainable, we’ll have to enable these fuels in one way or another.”

Dodd has been outspoken in her concerns about “flight shame” – the guilt caused by being a passenger on a CO2-emitting aircraft. While scientists have raised concerns about global tourism emissions, Dodd said the issues should be tackled collectively.

People “shouldn’t necessarily have to stop doing what we love doing and what makes the world tick. We just need to be really innovative about how we can move forward”, she said.

“I think that we need to pay great attention to the challenges of decarbonising aviation,” she said.

“I understand that decarbonising the electricity system must be a priority, but we also need to consider sustainable aviation fuels to ensure it receives the necessary business and policy support.

“Aviation is a particularly hard-to-abate sector, and everyone I know in the industry is deeply committed to making progress. I want to support and encourage their efforts … it’s important to address both electricity and aviation decarbonisation.”

Dodd said one possibility would be to encourage businesses and universities that used long-distance travel to invest in sustainable aviation fuels.

“[That would mean] businesses being aware of and paying attention to how impacted their supply chain is by aviation and how – for us to move forward – that perhaps they could be supporting and partnering the airlines to scale up commercial availability of sustainable aviation field,” she said.

“You want to ensure that we’re doing this in a way that is economically sensitive and that it won’t price certain people out of the market for flying, or for goods like flowers and coffee that we ship.”",https://wp.thenewdaily.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1743638332-pexels-refuelplane.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,N,,2025-04-11 09:57:12.891883

US President Donald Trump’s tariff plans, particularly on imported vehicles, sparked concern over the effects of the tariffs on such purchases, and subsequently diesel demand growth.

Furthermore, data released by the Department for Energy Security revealed that the UK’s crude oil production rose for the third consecutive month during January, reaching the highest levels since May 2023.

Meanwhile, data also highlighted that the UK’s consumption of refined petroleum products declined by 2% compared to the year prior, with diesel demand falling by 12,250 barrels per day from December 2024’s levels.

Sterling appreciated from US$1.270 to US$1.291 throughout March, reaching a four-month high as uncertainty dominated US markets. Trump’s global tariff plans sparked concerns over the potential impacts of higher prices on demand growth as the President pledged to implement trade tariffs on imports from all US trading partners.

By mid-month, market attention turned to key monetary policy decisions whereby both the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at 4.5% and in the range of 4.25-4.5%, respectively.

By month-end, sterling traded within the US$1.29-US$1.30 range following the UK Spring Budget, which revealed government spending cuts of £3.6 billion to adhere to fiscal rules. As sterling strengthened against the US dollar throughout March, UK wholesale diesel became marginally cheaper by 0.74ppl.

Wholesale UK renewable diesel (HVO) prices rose from 106ppl to 112ppl (excluding duty and Renewable Transport Fuel Certificate (RTFC) benefit) during March, underpinned by increasing cost pressures amid feedstock prices rising to three-year highs, particularly for used cooking oil (UCO).

Supply-side concerns mounted as markets awaited guidance by the Indonesian government on UCO export restrictions after it issued regulations to curb exports earlier in the year.

From mid-month, the UK initiated an anti-dumping investigation into HVO imports from the US following a request from several stakeholders on reports that the price cap had narrowed and HVO may now be directly competing with UK-produced biodiesel.

Furthermore, a feasibility study of conversion of Grangemouth oil refinery to a renewable fuel facility was carried out by EY on behalf of the UK government. It presented nine projects that could be integrated, with one proposal being a sustainable aviation fuel and HVO plant, costing £800 million. An outline of final recommendations is expected to be published soon.

In other news, North Ayrshire council has transitioned thirty-six refuse collection vehicles from diesel to HVO to support Scottish Government sustainability goals that include phasing out new diesel or petrol vehicles in public sector fleets by 2030. Reports suggested that the council’s transition could save around 2,529 tonnes of carbon emissions over 12 months.

Furthermore, Neste delivered its first load of HVO to a cruise terminal in Singapore, kickstarting Singapore’s path to decarbonisation amid various industry goals to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. In the European market, Aral has started offering HVO at two new filling stations in Germany to supply the HGV sector.

The cost of blending biodiesel to UK B7 specification rose from 6.9ppl to 7.1ppl throughout March. The cost of Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) compliance rose as the cost of FAME-10 increased by approximately 2% across the month.

The 2024/25 Net Zero Report, based on a survey of sustainability leaders from 350 financial firms across 13 countries, highlights that 72% of institutions have no plans to reduce fossil fuel investments over the next decade.

At the same time, 44% intend to increase their exposure to low-carbon assets, and nearly 80% are more inclined to fund companies with clear climate transition plans.

According to Dr. Daniel Klier, CEO of South Pole, the findings underscore a troubling paradox: “Financial institutions want to have their cake and eat it too.”

He added that while financiers are ramping up climate-related engagement with their portfolio companies, they continue to fund fossil fuels, walking “a tightrope” between long-term climate goals and short-term investor returns.

Unclear regulation remains a major obstacle, with 47% of respondents citing it as a barrier to achieving net zero targets.

Despite these challenges, 86% of institutions say they are on track or partially on track to meet their commitments, and 88% expect to increase engagement with portfolio companies on decarbonization within the next two years.

Dame Inga Beale, Chair of South Pole’s Board, noted that insurance companies are emerging as leaders in this transition.

“Those who proactively manage risk today will be better positioned for success tomorrow,” she said, highlighting stricter decarbonization standards in the insurance sector.

Mandates such as the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in the U.S. and the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) in the European Union have set minimum blending requirements for biofuels in transportation fuels. Additionally, tax credits, subsidies, and carbon pricing mechanisms are making biofuels a more attractive alternative to fossil fuels.

For example, the U.S. government provides a biodiesel tax credit of $1 per gallon, benefiting companies such as Renewable Energy Group (REG) and Valero Energy Corporation, which produce and distribute biodiesel and renewable diesel. Similarly, Neste, a Finland-based company, is expanding its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in response to EU regulations promoting the use of biofuels in aviation.

Feedstock Supply Constraints and Competition with Food Production

One of the most pressing challenges in the biofuel industry is the limited availability of sustainable feedstocks. First-generation biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, primarily rely on corn, sugarcane, soy, and palm oil, leading to concerns over food security and land use conflicts. The expansion of biofuel production in regions like Brazil, Indonesia, and the U.S. has sparked debates about deforestation, biodiversity loss, and rising food prices.

As governments push for higher biofuel blending targets, competition between food and fuel markets intensifies. For example, Indonesia's biodiesel program has driven up palm oil demand, impacting food prices and contributing to deforestation. Similarly, ethanol production in the U.S. has raised concerns over corn availability for food and livestock feed. To overcome this challenge, the industry must diversify feedstock sources, focusing on waste-based, cellulosic, and algae-based biofuels. However, these alternatives require significant investments in technology and infrastructure, delaying large-scale commercialization.

That slightly outpaces the Gulfstream G700 , which tops out at Mach 0.935. While both are leaders in the ultra-long-range jet category, Bombardier has claimed the crown for speed - a defining factor for time-sensitive operators and elite business travelers.

Speed is a critical factor for many business jet customers. A few minutes saved per leg adds up over transcontinental operations. High cruise speeds improve scheduling flexibility, reduce fatigue on long-haul missions, and appeal to very busy executives. In our article, we will compare the Global 8000 and G700’s speed capabilities, examine the technology behind them, and assess what it means for their market positioning.

Performance By The Numbers: Bombardier Global 8000 vs Gulfstream G700

The Bombardier Global 8000 cruises at Mach 0.94 and offers a maximum range of 8,000 nautical miles (14,816 kilometers). Its GE Passport engines balance high thrust with efficiency. In comparison, the Gulfstream G700 reaches Mach 0.935 and can fly up to 7,750 nautical miles (14,353 kilometers), using Rolls-Royce Pearl 700 engines. Both jets feature advanced aerodynamics and support for sustainable aviation fuel.

Neither aircraft currently has multiple variants. The Global 8000 was derived from the Global 7500 platform, achieving performance gains through aerodynamic enhancements and software updates. Gulfstream has opted to reserve upgrades for its upcoming G800 while continuing to refine the G700 as its premier offering.

According to Bombardier's official website, the Global 8000 is the fastest non-military jet after the Concorde:

“Our Global 8000 is the world’s fastest civilian aircraft since Concorde with a top speed of Mach 0.94 and the only business jet with four true living spaces and a range of 8000 nautical miles to take you faster, farther and in greater comfort than anything else in business aviation.”

The Global 8000 also made headlines during certification testing in 2021 by achieving a whooping Mach 1.015 in a dive, which was confirmed by a NASA F-18 chase plane, validating its structural integrity and high-speed capability. Gulfstream has also extensively tested the G700, aiming for full customer deliveries this year.

Specifications: Gulfstream G700 vs Bombardier Global 8000

How The Global 8000 Achieves This Performance

The Global 8000’s impressive speed is possible thanks to its aerodynamic wing design and efficient GE Passport turbofans. The aircraft also features the Vision flight deck and Bombardier’s Pũr Air system, contributing to a low cabin altitude and high comfort without sacrificing performance.

To reach Mach 0.94, the Global 8000 typically cruises much higher than commercial airliners, between 41,000 and 45,000 feet. Top speeds are most achievable under lighter load conditions, with fuel and payload optimized for long-haul missions in favorable atmospheric conditions.

There are trade-offs. High-speed operations require precise flight planning and elevated maintenance demands. The increased performance also comes with a higher purchase price and requires strict adherence to operational envelopes for noise and wear limitations.

How Bombardier Global 8000 Compares To Gulfstream G700 and Other Competing Aircraft

Many early Global 8000 orders are upgrades from the Global 7500, signaling customer trust. The launch customer for the brand-new Bombardier is one of the world’s largest private jet rental companies – NetJets, which has already placed an order for four aircraft. NetJets is also a key client using Global 7500.

Operators have praised its quiet interior, low cabin altitude, and stable handling at high altitudes. While full operational feedback will expand following the 2025 entry into service, initial impressions suggest Bombardier’s promises are becoming a reality.

Meanwhile, the Gulfstream G700 has been embraced by key clients, including Qatar Executive (a business jet charter branch of Qatar Airways), Flexjet, and private owners worldwide. Feedback highlights its cabin comfort, advanced avionics, and performance on long-haul sectors. Gulfstream has reported strong interest and order backlogs, with operators particularly praising the G700’s smooth handling and innovative cockpit design.

The Story Behind the Aircraft's Development

The Global 8000 was conceived during a period of post-pandemic resurgence in business aviation, when speed, range, and health-conscious features gained new prominence.

Bombardier built on the Global 7500’s success, launching the Global 8000 in 2022 with upgraded aerodynamics and cabin innovations. Development stayed largely in-house, with certification milestones achieved using the same test fleet.

Meanwhile, the Gulfstream G700 was announced in 2019 as a direct response to growing demand for ultra-long-range, high-performance jets. It was built on the proven and well-tested G650 platform but stretched to accommodate more cabin space. It was integrated with next-generation technology, including the Symmetry Flight Deck and advanced fly-by-wire systems. The G700 also introduced Gulfstream’s Predictive Landing Performance System and SmartView Synthetic Vision, improving safety and situational awareness. Gulfstream targeted operators who prioritize comfort, operational range, and speed, positioning the G700 as its flagship. The aircraft completed its maiden flight in early 2020 and has undergone an extensive test campaign with multiple prototypes.

What Comes Next?

Interior upgrades, new tech packages, and potential cabin re-configurations will likely follow as the Global 8000 enters service. Though no new variants have been announced, software improvements and connectivity enhancements are on the roadmap.

Other prominent competitors like the Falcon 10X and Gulfstream G800 could shift the competitive balance, but it will take significant innovations to match the Global 8000’s Mach 0.94 mark.

Malaysia's strategic positioning as the current chair of ASEAN presents a unique opportunity to drive regional sustainability initiatives.","KUALA LUMPUR 11 April - Malaysia's strategic pivot towards becoming a regional Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) hub, as prominently discussed at the recent Airbus Industry Outreach, presents a complex yet promising narrative.

An in-depth analysis reveals a nation leveraging its abundant resources and proactive policies, but also confronting significant logistical and technological challenges.

The pivotal question remains: can Malaysia effectively harness collaborative innovation, particularly through its strengthened alliance with Airbus and its long-term strategic vision, to realize its ambitious SAF goals?

In a landmark move to revolutionize the skies, aerospace giant Airbus and the Aerospace Malaysia Innovation Centre (AMIC) have inked a cutting-edge research and technology deal aimed at powering up the SAF supply chain across the Asia-Pacific region.

This collaboration, as highlighted during the Airbus Industry Outreach, underscores the strategic importance of Malaysia in the region's sustainable aviation future.

Airbus's strategic endorsement of Malaysia's potential, encapsulated in their statement, ""We see huge potential here in Malaysia,"" underscores the nation's burgeoning role in regional sustainability. This aligns seamlessly with Airbus Chief Sustainability Officer Julie Kitcher's overarching vision.

Interviewed by DagangNews following the Airbus Industry Outreach event in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday, Kitcher articulated: ""Our primary focus is to ramp up those aircraft, so that our airlines can take delivery of those most fuel efficient planes in support of their competitiveness."" This dual emphasis on production efficiency and sustainability is central to Airbus's strategy.

Kitcher's insights shed light on Airbus's approach to balancing production demands with sustainability goals. Addressing supply chain challenges post-COVID, she noted, ""We delivered 766 aircraft last year, so the ramp up is progressing and this year our guidance is to deliver around 820 commercial aircraft.""

This focus on delivering fuel-efficient aircraft directly supports the industry's net-zero 2050 goal, as these planes represent the ""first lever to that sustainability goal.""

Furthermore, Kitcher outlined Airbus's comprehensive sustainability priorities, encompassing internal emission reductions and industry-wide targets. ""We have a number of priorities for our own company, so to reduce our scope one and scope two emissions by 63% by 2030,"" she stated, emphasizing the company's commitment to reducing its environmental footprint.

These internal targets, coupled with the industry-wide goal of ""improving the CO2 intensity of our aircraft delivered by 46% by 2035,"" underscore Airbus's holistic approach to sustainability.

When asked on the Airbus-AMIC collaboration, Kitcher explained, ""The signing ceremony that just took place with AMIC is basically to research the potential of feedstock in Malaysia, so the different types of feedstock, the different locations of feedstock and their suitability for conversion into sustainable aviation fuel under the sustainability criteria as defined by ICAO.""

This research-driven partnership is crucial for Malaysia, facilitating a deeper understanding of its feedstock resources and optimizing the SAF supply chain.

Adding to this context, speaking to DagangNews, Emeritus Professor Tan Sri Dr. Zakri Abdul Hamid, Chairman of AMIC, provided further insight into the long-standing relationship with Airbus and the strategic importance of the collaboration.

""Well, you must realise we had a very long history with Airbus, we have been in this country for 40 years,"" he stated, emphasizing the established partnership.

He highlighted the research focus, stating, ""This research is to explore the prospect of SAF in this part of the world,"" and underscored Malaysia's unique advantage, ""Because we are a highly biodiverse country.""

Dr. Zakri also emphasized the specific research team involved: ""One of the lead researchers is Distinguished Professor Dr. Phang Siew Moi from USCI University with Leong Sat Sing Vice President, Group Sustainability Office and also some others."" He acknowledged the economic realities of SAF production, stating,

""There's one conditionality still very expensive to produce, so maybe 2030 and beyond, but the roadmap is there, so this is where we are to go.”

He also highlighted the magnitude of the project, stating, ""This is a bigger one, bigger money at about three million ringgit and all that.""

This long-term perspective highlights the strategic nature of the collaboration, focusing on building a sustainable SAF industry for the future.

However, a critical analysis continues to expose a pressing supply-demand disparity. While Malaysia boasts significant SAF feedstock resources, the current availability of key components, such as used cooking oil, falls considerably short of projected demand.

This necessitates a strategic diversification of feedstock sources and a robust scaling of collection infrastructures.

Furthermore, the geographic distribution of these resources, predominantly concentrated in Sabah, Sarawak, and Johor, presents intricate logistical challenges that demand meticulous planning and substantial investment.

The success of Malaysia's SAF strategy is inextricably linked to its ability to overcome these logistical and technological hurdles through collaborative innovation.

This is precisely where the reinforced research and technology cooperation agreement between Airbus and AMIC becomes pivotal, now further clarified by both Kitcher's and Dr. Zakri's insights.

Earlier in her speech at the Outreach event, Kitcher said, ""Decarbonising aviation at speed and scale requires bold action and collaboration across sectors – from airlines, manufacturers and airports to regulators, governments and investors.""

This collaboration is vital for Malaysia, facilitating knowledge and technology transfer, and strengthening the nation's SAF production capacity.

Notably, the Airbus-AMIC partnership prioritizes feedstocks and pathways validated under the ICAO-CORSIA framework, ensuring alignment with internationally recognized sustainability standards.

A strategic analysis of the global SAF market reveals a complex landscape characterized by a current supply surplus, largely due to the high cost of SAF.

However, long-term projections indicate a surge in demand, necessitating immediate investment in new SAF projects.

To navigate this landscape, Malaysia must implement a proactive policy framework that incentivizes investment and fosters a level playing field.

""Innovation, technology is on track to achieve progress towards these goals,"" Kitcher asserts, underscoring the necessity of a supportive regulatory environment.

Malaysia's strategic positioning as the current chair of ASEAN presents a unique opportunity to drive regional sustainability initiatives.

This leadership role, coupled with its abundant natural resources, proactive policies, and strategic collaborations like the one with Airbus and AMIC, positions Malaysia to become a key player in the global SAF market.

By addressing the current challenges and fostering strategic partnerships, Malaysia can transform its ambitious SAF goals into a tangible economic and environmental reality, ensuring a sustainable future for its aviation sector and beyond.",http://www.dagangnews.com/sites/default/files/articles/Photo-%20Signing%20Ceremony.jpeg,N,,2025-04-11 02:56:26.065070

“Injecting Global Bioenergies’ SAF, without blending it with kerosene, produces a spray of fine, homogeneous droplets, very similar to the spray from Jet A-1, the standard fossil kerosene. These tests are feeding into the data that enable a better match between engine and fuel.”

ONERA, the French aerospace research centre has also carried out tests on a laboratory burner to quantify the particles emitted during combustion of Global Bioenergies’ SAF.

Louise Ganeau, research engineer at ONERA, explained: “Soot emitted during fuel combustion has an impact on air quality in airport areas. Incorporating SAFs such as Global Bioenergies’ into the fossil fuel landscape would help reduce soot emissions locally, and cut particulate pollution. Furthermore, from an environmental standpoint, SAF have a role to play in reducing net CO₂ emissions thanks to the way they are manufactured.”",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Global-Bioenergies-SAF-pic-Biofuel-11-4-768x509.jpg,N,,2025-04-11 02:56:32.281093

In this work, we introduce a new methodology to combine the available methods to predict the properties of complex hydrocarbon mixtures such as aviation fuels. Due to the complexity of aviation fuels, the available methods perform well individually on some of the experimental observations and vice versa on others when a surrogate aviation fuel is defined and used. To this end, we introduce a new ensemble model based on the existing methods that combine and weigh their predictions. We employ the probabilistic Bayesian approach to predict aviation fuel properties with confidence levels. This is necessary because the available experimental data for aviation fuels is generally limited, which leads to overfitting. We adopt both “interpretable” Bayesian regression and a more “black-box” approach to Bayesian neural networks. An ensemble of predictive methods provided better predictions than the individual methods with robust confidence levels for three properties considered: mass density, kinematic viscosity, and flash point. A significant reduction in the mean absolute percentage error was obtained for mass density predictions, from 1.25% to 0.57% and 0.42%, using the Bayesian linear regression (BLR) and Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), respectively. The error in kinematic viscosity predictions was reduced from 17.25% to 9.02% and 6.79% using BLR and BNN, respectively. The error in flash point predictions is reduced from 9.04% to 5.83% by BLR and to 5.51% by BNN. The importance of the methods in the ensemble did not fully follow their individual performance, where the accurate models may not be the most important. The ensemble approach allows for the inclusion of new methods, even if they are slightly less accurate. This methodology can be extended to predict other aviation fuel properties and incorporate any predictive model. It also offers a way to generate valid training data for generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, helping to address the scarcity of aviation fuel data.",https://cdn.ssrn.com/ssrn-global-header/11589acb53bc518aa22929bf19add113.svg,N,,2025-04-11 03:56:19.280938

The report highlights Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam as having strong potential to produce SAF using feedstocks such as rice straw, cassava, and forestry residues. These low-carbon sources offer a viable path for the region to support greener aviation while boosting export potential.

By 2040, Indonesia and Vietnam could become key SAF exporters due to their cost-effective supply chains, while Japan and South Korea are expected to emerge as major importers within the region.

Unlike traditional biofuels, SAF can power modern aircraft with up to a 50% blend, without the need for infrastructure changes. It can cut aviation-related carbon emissions by as much as 80% over its lifecycle, depending on the feedstock used.

The study also emphasised that increased SAF production doesn’t require more land. Instead, mechanisation, better irrigation, and crop optimisation can enhance feedstock supply without contributing to deforestation.

Beyond the environmental benefits, the SAF industry is poised to bring economic and social gains—from job creation and skills development to promoting gender equality and opportunities for marginalised communities.

The next phase will focus on policy development, infrastructure investment, and industry partnerships to build a thriving SAF ecosystem in the region.

Sens. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Reps. Marcy Kaptur, D-Iowa, and Tracey Mann, R-Kan., on April 10 reintroduced legislation that aims to extend the 45Z clean fuel production credit and limit eligibility for the credit to renewable fuels made from domestically sourced feedstocks.

The bill, titled the Farmer First Fuel Incentives Act, was previously introduced in both the House and Senate last year. Sens. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa; Deb Fischer, R-Neb.; Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich.; Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., and Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., have signed on to cosponsor the current version of the bill.

The 45Z tax credit, established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, provides a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transformation fuels. The credit starts at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit is up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. The tax credit is currently in place for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

The Farmer First Fuel Incentives Act aims to extend the credit for an additional seven years, through the end of 2034. The bill also aims to add language to 45Z regulations limiting credit eligibility to fuel “derived from a feedstock which was produced or grown in the United States.”

With this bill they’ll have the certainty they need to accelerate innovation, create thousands of new jobs, and secure new markets for farmers and biofuel producers,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “We applaud Sen. Marshall and Sen. Klobuchar for their leadership and thank all our rural champions for working to put American renewable fuel producers and farmers in the best possible position to succeed in next generation fuel markets.”

The American Coalition for Ethanol is urging swift and science-based implementation of the 45Z credit.
Growth Energy called on Treasury to implement changes that would unleash U.S. energy production and unlock investments needed to restore the rural economy.
“With the §45Z credit already in effect, the clean fuels industry appreciates clarity on related implementation issues through either guidance and/or rulemaking,” Clean Fuels wrote.
Clean Fuels asks that Treasury and Congress level the playing field for farmers and fuel producers, supporting continued growth and innovation in domestic energy production.”","Representatives of the U.S. biofuels industry on April 10 submitted comments to the U.S. Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service providing recommendations on how to best implement upcoming 45Z clean fuel production credit regulations.

The Section 45Z credit, established by the Inflation Reduction Act, aims to incentivize the production of transportation fuels with lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions levels below certain levels. It provides a per-gallon (or gallon-equivalent) tax credit for producers of clean transportation fuels based on the CI of production.

The credit is currently in place for 2025-2027. For facilities that meet prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the credit is up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuel and up to $1.75 per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The base credit for facilities that do not meet prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements is 20 cents per gallon and 35 cents per gallon, respectively.

Treasury and the IRS in January published a notice of intent to propose 45Z regulations and a notice providing the annual emission rate table for the credit. Public comment periods on both notices were open through April 10.

The Renewable Fuels Association stressed that 45Z regulations need clarity, certainty and stability. “If properly implemented, the 45Z tax credit has the potential to advance U.S. energy security, prioritize domestic energy resources, strengthen rural economies, and create a transformative incentive for the adoption of new technologies in the renewable fuels and agriculture sectors,” wrote Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the RFA. “The technology-neutral intent of 45Z represents the most economically efficient and environmentally responsible approach to boosting U.S. energy production. However, for the 45Z program to truly drive innovation and value creation in the marketplace, Treasury must move expeditiously to propose, finalize, and promulgate implementing regulations. Clean fuel producers, including RFA’s members, are in desperate need of clarity, certainty, and stability in the regulatory framework supporting the 45Z tax credit.”

Cooper added that RFA believes the final 45Z regulations must recognize the realities of today’s biorefining and agriculture sectors and the complexities of our nation’s transportation fuels marketplace. At the same time, final regulations must maintain an intuitive and manageable approach to registration, reporting, and recordkeeping that creates the kind of dependable value that empowers businesses to invest.

The American Coalition for Ethanol is urging swift and science-based implementation of the 45Z credit. “The 45Z credit not only promotes U.S. energy security … but can also create good-paying jobs and unlock new markets for farmers and domestic biofuel producers,” wrote Brian Jennings, CEO of ACE.

ACE’s comments explain that the value of U.S. corn production has fallen, and input costs have risen. The group cites National Corn Growers Association data that farmers are forecast to experience their third consecutive year of net profit losses in 2025, projected to lose more than $160 per acre on average.

“Treasury should rapidly finalize 45Z guidance and include the technical guidelines for biofuel crops and carbon intensity calculator developed by USDA in the final 45Z rules, so ethanol producers and farmers can unlock new market opportunities,” Jennings added.

Growth Energy called on Treasury to implement changes that would unleash U.S. energy production and unlock investments needed to restore the rural economy. “The Trump administration has an important opportunity to give farmers and biofuel producers the freedom and flexibility to dominate clean fuel markets around the world and ensure that America wins the global race for the future of the skies,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “The previous administration passed on making 45Z an economic engine for rural America, but this U.S. Treasury could unleash billions of dollars of investment in America’s farm economy. We’re grateful to the Trump administration for taking a fresh look at 45Z, and we urge regulators to move quickly to restore our competitive edge across the heartland.”

Clean Fuels Alliance America urged Treasury to ensure a level playing field for U.S. farmers and adhere to legislative language indicating that co-processed fuels do not apply for the credit. “With the §45Z credit already in effect, the clean fuels industry appreciates clarity on related implementation issues through either guidance and/or rulemaking,” Clean Fuels wrote.

Kurt Kovarik, vice president of federal affairs at Clean Fuels, added, “Biofuels are essential to U.S. farm security. The unfinished rules for the Clean Fuel Production Credit are creating intolerable uncertainty for U.S. farmers and biodiesel and renewable diesel producers, putting jobs, economic opportunity, and growth in domestic energy production at risk. Clean Fuels asks that Treasury and Congress level the playing field for farmers and fuel producers, supporting continued growth and innovation in domestic energy production.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/epm/posts/web/2022/11/TreasurySeal_16679557681421.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 20:56:31.382221

The aviation industry is developing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to reduce its carbon emissions. Among potential feedstocks, Euglena gracilis-derived wax ester is promising because of its high short-chain fatty acid content, which lowers its freezing point for aviation applications. Under anaerobic conditions, E. gracilis converts intracellular paramylon into wax esters via fermentation. However, the conversion of paramylon to wax ester is influenced by CO2 availability, medium composition, and external carbon sources; hence, extensive investigations are warranted. This study evaluated the effects of CO2 purging, medium composition and pH, and glucose supplementation on wax ester biosynthesis under dark–anoxic conditions. Results demonstrated that CO2 purging increased wax ester productivity by 37% compared to that under hypoxic conditions. Moreover, HUTNER medium at pH 3 yielded the highest wax ester concentration (1.35 g/L), highlighting the importance of medium composition and pH. Furthermore, glucose supplementation combined with CO2 purging enhanced the overall carbon flux, achieving a wax ester titer of 4.44 g/L. These findings provide new insights into wax ester metabolism in E. gracilis and suggest effective strategies for enhancing anaerobic wax ester biosynthesis. Further research on cost-effective carbon sources, such as food byproducts, is essential to replace glucose and improve the commercial feasibility of Euglena-derived SAF.",https://cdn.ssrn.com/ssrn-global-header/11589acb53bc518aa22929bf19add113.svg,N,,2025-04-10 20:56:47.530927

Our partnership with Civo will accelerate the development of our data center decarbonization and efficiency technologies,” said Jonathan Godwin, CEO and co-founder of Orbital.

The initial deployment is expected to be deployed at an undisclosed UK data center by the end of 2025. In addition, Civo will provide Orbital access to a high performance compute cluster with H200 Nvidia GPUs to support its AI model training, which is integral in the development of its carbon removal technology.

“With the growing investment in UK data centers and the UK government’s AI action plan, we must implement solutions now to reduce the environmental impact of the UK’s expanding data center capacity,” said Mark Boost, CEO of Civo.

Civo currently has two operational data centers in the UK in London and Swindon. In addition, last December, it launched its second UK cloud region in collaboration with Deep Green.

Orbital has already developed a number of proprietary technologies for the data center market out of their research facility in Princeton, New Jersey, US. This includes dual-use chillers, that provide data center level heat ejection then use the waste heat to capture CO2, and extreme liquid cooling.

In order to develop its products, Orbital uses AI to support the testing and development of advanced materials and climate technologies. As part of this, it has developed a carbon-filtering substance for use in data centers, that acts like a sponge at the atomic level and is able to interact with CO2 and sequester it from the atmosphere.

According to the company, it has already achieved a 10x improvement in the performance of the material through the use of its AI platform.

The pilot project with Civo follows a similar agreement with Amazon Web Services (AWS) signed in December. As part of that agreement, Orbital will pilot the use of its carbon-filtering material at one of AWS' partner data centers in 2025. In addition, the deal permitted Orbital to use AWS technology to test more AI-generated materials to address water use and chip cooling in the data center sector.

Microsoft backs SAF

In other news, Microsoft announced it had signed a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) purchase agreement with International Airlines Group (IAG) to reduce its Scope 3 lifecycle emissions from business travel and air freight.

The agreement is a five-year extension on a previous deal and will see Microsoft co-fund an additional 39,000 tons of SAF. In addition to offsetting CO2 related to its corporate travel, the purchase intends to cover SAF used by IAG airlines to ship data center components.

“We are taking our collaboration with IAG further, extending our SAF purchase agreement to bring Microsoft closer to our goal of being carbon negative by 2030, while ensuring a multi-year commitment to help drive greater SAF production,” said Julia Fidler, environmental sustainability fuel and materials decarbonization lead at Microsoft.

The SAF used will be produced from used cooking oil and food waste at Phillips 66’s UK-based Humberside refinery, and from sustainably sourced bioethanol at Georgia-based LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels.

There’s a race on between the skies and the seas—and it’s not about who gets there first, but who gets to fuel the trip.

As both the aviation and maritime shipping industries ramp up plans to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, one thing has become crystal clear: biofuel won’t be enough for both.

That’s not just a guess. It’s backed by modeling from DNV, commissioned by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), which shows shipping alone could need up to 7.8 exajoules of biofuel annually by 2050—almost double the global supply of biofuels produced today.

>> RELATED: Clean Fuels, Clear Skies: How Maritime Shipping Is Turning to Hydrogen, Ammonia, and Carbon Capture

Aviation’s Advantage: Less Choice, More Cash

Airlines don’t have a lot of wiggle room. Unlike ships, planes can’t carry bulky batteries or store massive amounts of fuel without serious trade-offs in weight and space.

That’s why aviation has leaned hard into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—a type of biofuel rebranded with greener marketing. But SAF is still just biofuel, with the same production hurdles and environmental concerns that come with scaling it up.

According to the Clean Air Task Force (CATF), even if global production of sustainable biofuels triples by 2030—as optimistically projected by the International Energy Agency (IEA)—it would only cover 69% of aviation’s energy needs in 2030, and drop to 52% by 2050.

In other words, aviation is already facing a shortfall, even if it hoards every drop.

Bill Ayer, former CEO of Alaska Air Group, emphasized the importance of sustainable biofuels: “Sustainable biofuels are key to aviation's future.”

Maritime Shipping Needs to Change Course

So where does that leave shipping?

The marine sector is lucky in one way—it’s more flexible. Unlike planes, ships have room to play with bulkier fuel systems and heavier engines. This opens the door for fuels that aren’t practical in aviation but might work at sea.

One standout option: ammonia.

Ammonia isn’t new—it’s used all over the world in fertilizer production—but it's gaining traction as a low-carbon marine fuel. It can be used in both purpose-built and modified internal combustion engines. Some ports already store and handle it, which makes infrastructure upgrades more feasible.

The kicker? Ammonia is made from hydrogen and nitrogen, both widely available. That makes its production more scalable compared to biofuels, which rely on limited feedstocks like soy, corn, or crop waste.

Still, ammonia isn’t a free pass. Managing reactive nitrogen losses and ensuring safe fuel handling will be critical if it's going to become a mainstream shipping fuel.

Søren Toft, CEO of MSC, expressed skepticism about biofuels for maritime use: “In my opinion the biofuels should go to the aeroplanes, not the ships, because we get a much better climate impact from that.”

>> In Other News: [x](x)

Not Just a Fuel Issue—It’s a Policy One Too

All this is happening as the IMO prepares to finalize new decarbonization rules for the global shipping industry. Delegates at the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 83) meeting in London are expected to adopt a fuel carbon intensity standard and a pricing mechanism for maritime GHG emissions.

If the IMO assumes that shipping can count heavily on biofuels, they’re missing the bigger picture.

The entire global supply of sustainable biofuels may not even be enough to meet aviation’s needs. Expecting that there’ll be leftovers for shipping isn’t just unrealistic—it’s dangerous planning.

Jonathan Lewis, an expert at CATF, put it bluntly: “A carbon intensity standard for the maritime sector that assumes significant access to biofuels is destined to fail.”

Time to Invest Elsewhere

Maritime companies and policymakers have some tough decisions to make. But they also have an opportunity: to pivot early toward fuel options that can actually scale with demand.

Here’s what that could look like:

Funding R&D for ammonia-fueled engines and onboard storage systems

Building or upgrading bunkering infrastructure at ports

Limiting how much biofuel counts toward clean fuel mandates to reflect real-world availability

Supporting the development of synthetic fuels and hydrogen-based systems

These aren’t quick fixes—but neither is a bidding war with aviation that the shipping sector is almost guaranteed to lose.

Why the Biofuel Crunch Keeps Getting Ignored

You’d think this looming crisis would have more attention. But a few factors keep the alarm bells muted.

First, consumption levels are still low, so the pain of scarcity isn’t felt yet. Second, policymakers are hesitant to slow down farm economies, especially in regions dependent on biofuel crops. And finally, there’s still no global agreement on how to track and verify biofuels’ real environmental impacts, especially when it comes to land use and lifecycle emissions.

The result? Industries are building decarbonization plans in silos, without considering how their strategies collide in the real world.

Final Thoughts: Aviation May Win the Biofuel Battle, But We All Need to Win the Climate War

If aviation takes most of the biofuel—and it likely will—then maritime has to be ready with Plan B. That means moving fast on scalable, clean alternatives and building a fuel strategy that doesn’t hinge on hope.

There’s no silver bullet here. But ignoring the limits of biofuels while planning for a carbon-free future is like charting a route with no map.",https://decarbonfuse.com/assets/favi/favicon-32x32-b1c94ae87840c662751403aefa5b6ea92417e97aab4cbce5a1b99c4e112cac36.png,N,,2025-04-10 19:56:59.865091

“Farmers and businesses need to know this tax credit is here to stay before they can invest in dozens of new energy projects across rural America.
This legislation provides a roadmap for how the 45Z tax credit can be improved to support farmers, and we are glad to support its introduction.” “American tax incentives should support American farmers — not put them at a disadvantage.
“At the same time, eliminating the outdated and flawed Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) penalty removes an arbitrary barrier that unfairly punishes U.S. producers while benefiting foreign competitors.
“We applaud Senator Marshall, Senator Klobuchar and the co-sponsors for their efforts to improve and extend the tax credit for biofuels.","Washington – U.S. Senators Roger Marshall, M.D. (R-Kansas) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) today reintroduced the bipartisan and bicameral Farmer First Fuel Incentives Act, which would protect American farmers by restricting the eligibility of the 45Z Tax Credit to renewable fuels made only from domestically sourced feedstocks. U.S. Representatives Tracey Mann (R-Kansas-01) and Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio-09) have introduced an identical bill in the House of Representatives.

This bill would extend the 45Z tax credit and give the ethanol industry the time and financial incentive to build up the infrastructure needed for the U.S. to be less reliant on foreign fuel, open new markets for farmers, and increase ethanol production across the Midwest. Additionally, this bill fixes the glaring flaw in 45Z that negatively impacts farmers wanting to sell feedstocks to the biodiesel and renewable diesel industry. If 45Z continues as-is, taxpayers are at risk of further subsidizing Chinese-used cooking oil and undermining the use of soy, canola, sorghum, and corn oil in renewable fuels.

“The Farmer First Fuel Incentives Act is commonsense legislation that stops sending American taxpayer dollars to China, expands robust domestic markets for agriculture producers, and increases certainty for the biofuels industry,” said Senator Marshall. “With President Trump in the White House and Republicans leading both the Senate and House, we are finally putting American farmers first and supporting biofuels made in the U.S.A. It’s time our energy and agricultural policies reflect that.”

“Domestically produced biofuel strengthens our energy independence, supports our farmers, and boosts rural economies,” said Senator Klobuchar. “The introduction of the Farmers First Fuel Incentives Act is an important step as we work to maximize the potential of the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit and clean fuel investments across rural America. By extending the credit for another ten years, this legislation gives farmers and biofuel producers the certainty they need to provide consumers with affordable, lower-carbon fuel options.”

“American tax incentives should benefit American-grown products and American farmers, not foreign producers,” said Representative Mann. “Foreign feedstocks can play a significant role in producing domestically manufactured ethanol, biodiesel, renewable diesel, and sustainable aviation fuel, but we cannot allow them to displace harvest grown right in our backyard. Our tax code should reward their grit and tenacity, not prop up feedstocks grown overseas.”

“Today, I joined my colleagues in this important bicameral and bipartisan effort because helping American farmers, producers, and growers goes beyond state and party lines, and is more important now than ever,” said Representative Kaptur. “We must ensure the Clean Fuel Production tax credit is structured in a way that benefits domestic producers, and not one that advantages foreign-produced feedstocks from China or Brazil. Our legislation extends this credit through 2034 and will bolster American energy independence by prioritizing American producers and the production of domestic biofuels.”

This legislation is cosponsored by U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Deb Fischer (R-Nebraska), Elissa Slotkin (D-Michigan), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin), and Pete Ricketts (R-Nebraska).

“Throughout my time in Congress, I’ve led the charge to build certainty and clarity into biofuel policies and put Iowa farmers at the forefront of delivering better, more affordable options at the gas pump,” said Senator Ernst. “The Farmer First Fuel Incentives Act does just that by giving producers the long-term certainty they need to go all-in on increasing production of domestic biofuels. It’s critical that we fully leverage homegrown, American biofuels and ensure not a cent of taxpayer dollars fund fuel produced with foreign crops.”

“America’s biofuel producers are a key piece in helping to secure U.S. energy independence,” said Senator Fischer. “That’s why Americans’ hard-earned tax dollars should support home-grown feedstocks—not incentivize foreign competitors. Our bipartisan legislation ensures that renewable fuel tax incentives support American producers—not overseas interests.”

“American tax credits should support American farmers. The Farmer First Fuel Incentives Act provides long-term certainty for Nebraskan producers through tax policy that makes sense,” said Senator Ricketts. “By bolstering the development of a domestic fuel supply chain, this bipartisan bill puts American farmers first.”

The legislation is supported by Growth Energy, American Soybean Association, National Oilseed Processors Association (NOPA), National Corn Growers Association, National Sorghum Producers, U.S. Canola Association, and Renewable Fuels Association.

“Farmers and businesses need to know this tax credit is here to stay before they can invest in dozens of new energy projects across rural America. With this bill they’ll have the certainty they need to accelerate innovation, create thousands of new jobs, and secure new markets for farmers and biofuel producers,” said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor. “We applaud Sen. Marshall and Sen. Klobuchar for their leadership and thank all our rural champions for working to put American renewable fuel producers and farmers in the best possible position to succeed in next generation fuel markets.”

“ASA thanks Senators Marshall and Klobuchar for their leadership to ensure the 45Z tax credit supports domestic biofuel producers and domestic biofuel feedstock suppliers like soybean farmers,” said American Soybean Association President Caleb Ragland. “The updated Farmers First Fuel Incentives Act includes one of our top priorities: removing arbitrary indirect land use change calculations, which put soy and all of U.S. agriculture at a disadvantage to imported waste feedstocks of dubious origin. This legislation provides a roadmap for how the 45Z tax credit can be improved to support farmers, and we are glad to support its introduction.”

“American tax incentives should support American farmers — not put them at a disadvantage. Ensuring that only domestic feedstocks such as U.S.-grown soybeans qualify for U.S. tax credits is a straightforward way to strengthen our domestic supply chain and rural economy,” said National Oilseed Processors Association (NOPA) President and CEO Devin Mogler. “At the same time, eliminating the outdated and flawed Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) penalty removes an arbitrary barrier that unfairly punishes U.S. producers while benefiting foreign competitors. We appreciate Senators Marshall and Klobuchar for their leadership to ensure the Clean Fuel Production Credit works as intended — to support American agriculture and American energy.”

“We are deeply appreciative of these leaders for introducing legislation that establishes requirements for a tax credit that will level the playing field for America’s corn growers,” said National Corn Growers Association President Kenneth Hartman Jr. “This bill brings American farmers a step closer to unlocking an exciting new market with global reach.”

“We appreciate the focus on “farmers first” legislation and the support of 45Z and domestic feedstocks like sorghum,” said Amy France, Chair of the National Sorghum Producers. “Domestic biofuel production remains critical to our farm and our country’s success.”

“The U.S. Canola Association strongly supports the removal of arbitrary and uncertain indirect land use change (ILUC) assumptions from the calculation of federal clean fuel production tax credits,” said Tim Mickelson, President of the U.S. Canola Association. “We applaud Senator Marshall, Senator Klobuchar and the co-sponsors for their efforts to improve and extend the tax credit for biofuels. The flawed assumptions used to calculate indirect emissions have resulted in canola being excluded despite being a proven feedstock that the U.S. EPA’s analysis conservatively shows reduces emissions up to 78%. We urge Congress to enact these important changes to provide certainty, stability, and market opportunity for canola growers and our biofuels industry partners.”

This significant development increases Neste’s global SAF production capability to an impressive 1.5 million tons (approximately 1.875 billion liters) annually.

The modifications undertaken at the Rotterdam refinery now enable Neste to produce up to 500,000 tons of SAF per year. This milestone marks a crucial step in addressing the aviation industry's climate impact and supports the implementation of regulations like the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, which mandates increasing levels of SAF blending in Europe.

This latest development is part of Neste’s broader strategy to invest significantly in renewable fuel production capacity. The company is currently undertaking a major strategic growth investment project in Rotterdam, which will more than double the refinery’s annual production capacity of renewable products to 2.7 million tons. Upon its scheduled completion in 2027, the Rotterdam facility will become the world’s largest producer of renewable diesel and SAF.

Heikki Malinen, President and CEO of Neste, emphasized the urgency of climate action within the aviation sector. “It is clear that we need to continue making progress in mitigating climate change and addressing aviation’s climate impact. Neste is fully committed to supporting its customers in the aviation industry to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, and this milestone underlines that commitment,” he stated in a press release issued at 4 p.m. (EET).

Malinen further highlighted the significance of this expansion in the context of evolving policy. “Our SAF production capability, now also in Rotterdam, enables us to significantly contribute to the implementation of the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation and similar SAF mandates. Policies like these are crucial to ramping-up SAF production and usage, and we need to keep our ambitions and targets high. At the same time it requires support and close cooperation across the whole aviation ecosystem to accelerate the energy transition and related emission reductions.”

The ongoing expansion in Rotterdam will contribute significantly to Neste’s overall global renewable fuels production capacity, increasing it to 6.8 million tons annually. Of this total, Neste’s annual SAF production capability is projected to reach 2.2 million tons.

Beyond Rotterdam, Neste also possesses SAF production capabilities at its refineries in Singapore and Porvoo, Finland.

AI is exponentially more resource and capital intensive than previous technology paradigms – which means Big Tech companies need to find every efficiency angle possible.
Now, Big Tech will look to drive favorable deals with energy providers – if they don’t outright buy power plants themselves.
Thus far, Big Tech companies have primarily entered into power purchase agreements (PPAs) with energy providers.
This matters since Big Tech companies have yet to completely turn-face on their lofty environmental pledges.","To beat out both alternative energy sources, and alternative ownership models like vertical integration of energy generation into Big Tech supply chains, natural gas providers must prove their expertise at both economic and environmental sustainability.

According to Goldman Sachs, AI is poised to drive a 165% increase in data center energy demand by 2030. Big Tech needs so much power to fuel their AI investments, in fact, they are moving closer and closer toward integrating their own power supplies into their operational models. For example, Meta will become Entergy’s single largest customer once plans to build 3 power plants dedicated exclusively to supplying energy for Meta’s AI data center are completed. Chevron and GE recently announced a partnership to build the first multi gigawatt-scale co-located power plant and data center. Investors are taking note and incorporating a new type of asset into their technology investment strategy – Blackstone just acquired a power plant in Virginia’s Data Center Alley.

Given their demand for large, reliable energy supply, it is not surprising Big Tech, or as the industry has redubbed them “Hyperscale tech giants,” are turning to colocation and off-grid strategies to secure power – and control cost. According to Power Engineering hooking up to the grid can entail a 5-7 year wait time – which is out of the question for tech behemoths spending billions of dollars to ramp up AI datacenters this year.

The result? A new type of relationship between energy and technology companies in which energy becomes a competitive edge in Big Tech’s supply chain.

In this new world order, there will be winners. But what will dictate who gets the spoils (e.g. lucrative off-grid contracts to supply power to data centers)? Nimble, fast solutions to ramp up energy supply is certainly part of the answer – but it’s not the whole equation. In addition to speed, energy providers who can meet the dual challenges of efficiency and sustainability stand to gain in this new paradigm.

To win data center contracts, it will be increasingly important for energy companies to drive – and show – measurable operational efficiency gains. Even setting aside for a moment the sensitive cost dynamics of the AI market, it’s safe to assume that the closer “supply” gets to integrating into Big Tech’s supply chain, the greater the pressure for operational efficiency will be.

AI is exponentially more resource and capital intensive than previous technology paradigms – which means Big Tech companies need to find every efficiency angle possible. A recent illustration of the sensitive dynamics of the AI market: when China’s DeepSeek announced that its models allegedly use 10-40x less electricity than US-developed AI models, the stock market reacted with chip and energy stocks dipping. Microsoft and Google dipped too – why? Because less energy means fewer dollars spent on energy, giving DeepSeek a competitive advantage in the AI race. Energy costs account for 46% of total expenditures for enterprise datacenters, and 60% for service provider datacenters, according to a recent IDC report. The operational cost of data centers account for 15-20% of total AI investment by Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon according to expenditure numbers reported in Quartz. Thus, reducing energy costs is a huge lever in the AI race – one technology companies will do everything they can to pull.

Technology companies have already invested significantly in improving operational efficiency within datacenters. To reduce the resource-intensity of cooling processes, one source reports Microsoft is exploring everything from liquid cooling technology to an out-of-the-box concept of building data centers under water. Existing technology, magnetic bearing chillers, have already been proven to yield significant efficiency gains — reducing cooling costs by up to 40%, according to one study.

Now, Big Tech will look to drive favorable deals with energy providers – if they don’t outright buy power plants themselves. Thus far, Big Tech companies have primarily entered into power purchase agreements (PPAs) with energy providers. But, with Amazon’s acquisition of a nuclear-powered datacenter and associated energy infrastructure from Talen Energy last March and their direct investment in X-Energy to support the development of small nuclear reactors (SMRs), it’s easy to see how the mother of all vertical integrators could move into the energy business one day. In fact, Tesla is already in the energy generation business through their virtual power plant program, which aggregates and sells clean energy produced by at-home chargers back to the grid. All this suggests that IPPs need to act now to lock down contracts with AI data centers – or risk less favorable dynamics when Big Tech companies fully realize their appetite for DIYing power generation.

Historically, nuclear power has been talked about as a big winner in the AI data center game. However, natural gas power plants can generally be built in half the time as nuclear plants – or less. Technology like SMRs may be promising in the future – but for now, SMRs are not widely available and scalable. The real advantage nuclear has over natural gas is that it is both clean and reliable energy. This matters since Big Tech companies have yet to completely turn-face on their lofty environmental pledges. Knowing this, traditional energy companies like Exxon and Chevron are building carbon capture into their courtship of data center contracts.

However, carbon capture can significantly increase the operational costs of gas-powered plants. For natural gas providers to win long-term they will have to find solutions that prioritize operational efficiency while also supporting decarbonization efforts – if for no other reason than to hedge future shifts in political and regulatory winds. Luckily, existing technology can help natural gas companies check off both operational efficiency and sustainability boxes in their proposals to data center operators. For example, carbon capture is great – what if it was done at no additional cost and the captured CO2 was used to power turbines? It’s possible! Already have a power plant? What if infrastructure could be retrofit with turboexpander generators operating on magnetic bearing technology that could capture waste energy created in natural gas expansion processes and convert it to clean electricity that could be sold back into the grid or used to reduce operational costs (and emissions)? Also possible!

Which is to say, natural gas is a natural fit for data centers due to its reliability, scalability, speed-to-market, and cost-efficiency. If natural gas companies can figure out the last piece of the puzzle – decarbonization – without compromising any of these core value drivers, they stand to win big in the race to power AI.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/freddie-sarhan.png,N,,2025-04-10 15:56:39.267953

Neste is fully committed to supporting its customers in the aviation industry to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, and this milestone underlines that commitment,” said Heikki Malinen, president and CEO of Neste. He further emphasised the importance of policy frameworks such as the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, stating that such mandates are critical for scaling up SAF production and adoption.

Neste’s SAF is produced from 100 percent renewable waste and residue raw materials, offering a direct way to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuel.

Continued Strategic Investment in Renewable Fuels

Alongside the SAF production launch, Neste is progressing with its major strategic investment project in Rotterdam. This expansion will more than double the site’s renewable fuel production capacity to 2.7 million tonnes per year, positioning it as the largest renewable diesel and SAF production facility in the world. Completion is expected by 2027.

Once the expansion is finalised, Neste’s total global renewable fuels production capacity will reach 6.8 million tonnes annually. Of that, up to 2.2 million tonnes will be dedicated to SAF, reinforcing the company’s role as a key enabler of the aviation industry’s energy transition.

In addition to Rotterdam, Neste produces SAF at its refineries in Singapore and Porvoo, Finland, strengthening its global supply network and positioning it to meet the increasing demand for low-emission solutions in aviation.",https://storageterminalsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Neste-renewables-refinery-in-Rotterdam.png,N,,2025-04-11 00:57:00.883189

“We are really just at the inception point of what this market is going to look like over the next 10 years,” Dange said in an exclusive interview. The company’s strategy hinges on securing early-mover advantages in a market expected to grow exponentially as airlines race to meet carbon reduction mandates.

Crucial to XCF’s public debut is its newly inked 15-year agreement with energy company Phillips 66 for both feedstock supply and offtake—a move Dange describes as “a base case model which is mitigated and has upside.” The agreement is designed to ensure operational stability while giving XCF the flexibility to pursue better pricing opportunities. It also allows for flexibility if circumstances change. “We pay for the right to move away from the Phillips 66 relationship if we want to, ” he added.

IRA Uncertainty Casts a Shadow

Despite the momentum, concerns loom over the stability of federal incentives such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The federal producer credits, vital for SAF economics, are set to expire in 2027. “..if federal credits left, there would be some type of state credits helping to push forward,” Dange assured.

In California, once the poster child for green fuel adoption, recent legislative changes have shifted momentum to other states. “We’re seeing a lot of that production actually moving out of the state and going into other states,” Dange observed.

But the company is betting on a shifting landscape across the country, where state-level incentives fill the federal gap. “Nevada is working on AB 481, which is potentially putting two and a half dollars of credits per gallon,” said Dange, emphasizing the importance of local legislation for future viability.

Emerging hubs like Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Washington, and Nevada are positioning themselves with new tax credits and rural development programs. “There are so many different business models that there is not one right answer,” he said, highlighting the industry’s experimental phase.

Still, the potential withdrawal of federal support raises broader questions about whether the reduced support in the U.S. can sustain the industry. “It would be foolish to think that a domestic-only strategy would be the only strategy going forward,” XCF Global’s CEO warns.

International Demand for SAF: Europe Leads, Asia Follows

Globally, the SAF sector is gaining steam. Europe, with its stringent mandates—2% SAF in 2025 scaling up to 70% by 2050—is leading the charge. “You cannot use book and claim to put it into the wing. You have to actually have the molecule into the wing of the plane,” Dange said, underlining Europe’s push for real emissions reductions.

Other regions are quickly catching up. “Japan is looking at a mandate. Australia wants to put a mandate. China has targets,” Dange noted, painting a picture of burgeoning international demand.

CORSIA Demand and XCF’s Expanding Project Pipeline

This pipeline of countries and markets provides certainty for future plans and could tie in nicely with the aviation industry’s main mechanism for SAF adoption – the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

The sector’s adoption of CORSIA standards is creating a baseline of demand for low-carbon aviation fuel. “CORSIA and international mandates…will not change the supply-demand need that more infrastructure has to come up, period” Dange stressed.

Looking ahead, XCF Global plans to leverage its first project’s success to launch additional production facilities. New projects will be shaped by local incentives, feedstock availability, and export opportunities, even involving complex logistics like “moving product from Reno to Europe” if economics allow.

At first glance this is a difficult moment for all carbon mitigating initiatives in the U.S. with various incentives being removed from the board and increasing uncertainty and risk. “That difficulty is also the opportunity that is born in the space,” Mihir Dange concluded.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mihir-Dange-Headshot-Cropped-V.Final-Greyed-e1744312517914.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 15:56:44.974394

It aims to support Microsoft’s goal to reduce Scope 3 lifecycle emissions from business travel and air freight.

Explaining further, Microsoft will co-fund an additional 39,000 tonnes of SAF that will cut 113,000 tonnes of lifecycle emissions.

The renewed agreement is an extension of their 2023 collaboration, when both companies pledged to support low-carbon aviation. For Microsoft, it’s a huge step toward achieving its 2030 carbon-negative goal.

Microsoft Targets Scope 3 Emissions with Major SAF Deal

Microsoft’s Scope 3 emissions rose by 30.9% in 2023 compared to its 2020 baseline. This increase was mainly due to the growth of its data center operations and the hardware needed to support them. Business travel and air freight also remain major contributors.

Total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were 15.4 MtCO₂e in 2023, a 29.1% rise compared to the 2020 baseline.

Currently, over 96% of Microsoft’s total emissions come from Scope 3.

The tech giant is already boosting clean energy use across its supply chain and investing in low-carbon technologies for hard-to-decarbonize industries, such as steel, concrete, and other building materials used in its data centers.

The company’s $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund has already invested in LanzaJet, showing the company’s strong commitment to supporting next-generation fuel solutions and accelerating climate technology.

Thus, this deal is a significant part of Microsoft’s net-zero emissions pathway. It expects SAF use to make a notable impact on its air travel and freight shipments’ emissions.

SAF: A Key Step Toward Greener Flights, But Challenges Remain

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel. According to the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, SAF includes synthetic fuels, biofuels made from plant or waste materials, and recycled carbon fuels and not fossil fuels.

While it doesn’t cut emissions from aircraft engines directly, it lowers overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when considering the full life cycle, i.e., from production to use.

SAF reduces carbon emissions (on a greenhouse gas lifecycle basis) typically by 80% or more compared with the fossil jet fuels it replaces.

However, there are still big hurdles. Both IAG and Microsoft have acknowledged that scaling SAF production remains a challenge, largely due to high costs. SAF is still 3 to 4 times more expensive than traditional jet fuel. Notably, a small percentage of airline fuel today is SAF. Its production and availability need to grow much faster to make a real impact.

Consequently, the European Union introduced the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation. It’s also a part of the Fit for 55 plan that aims to cut emissions by 55% by 2030.

The regulation pushes fuel suppliers at EU airports to gradually mix more SAF into their fuel blends. Eventually, it can make the shift toward more sustainable flying easier.

The SAF will be sourced from two locations:

Phillips 66’s refinery in Humberside, UK, using used cooking oil and food waste.

LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Georgia, USA, using bioethanol.

Both SAF sources are ISCC-certified (International Sustainability & Carbon Certification). Additionally, the SAF used in this deal will not add new fossil carbon to the atmosphere as it recycles existing carbon.

How the Deal Benefits IAG and What are its Future Plans

However, this SAF deal benefits both Microsoft and IAG. While Microsoft can control its emissions from travel and freight, IAG can boost its SAF investments and lower its direct flight emissions.

IAG airlines follow carbon reduction rules under the EU, UK, and Swiss Emissions Trading Schemes. They also support CORSIA’s global plan to cap net aviation emissions.

Emission Reduction Goals

IAG aims to have net-zero emissions by 2050.

By 2025, it plans to cut carbon emissions per passenger kilometer by 10%—from 87.3g in 2020 to 80g.

To reach this, they’re adding 142 new aircraft that burn up to 25% less fuel. This also brings fuel use down to just 3.17 liters per 100 passenger kilometers.

By 2030, it intends to bring net emissions down to 22 million tonnes. That would be a 20% drop and will save 160 million tonnes of CO₂ over the decade.

Boosting SAF Use

Notably, the sustainable fuel from this agreement will power flights across IAG’s brands, including British Airways. In 2021, it set a target of using one million tonnes of SAF annually by 2030. Currently, the airline uses SAF for 1.9% of its total annual fuel. The right policy support could cut as much carbon as taking one million cars off the road annually.

By 2030, IAG aims to increase SAF use 100 times compared to 2022 levels. Its target is to reach 10% SAF by 2030 and 70% by 2050.

As of last December, the company had committed over $3.5 billion to SAF offtake deals. This is based on expected energy prices and contract terms.

This deal shows how companies can drive greener skies. By supporting cleaner fuels like SAF and influencing wider supply chains, Microsoft and IAG are taking the right steps to fight climate change.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/shutterstock_2402135107.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 15:56:49.843988

Innovating for manufacturing sustainability

In FY 2023/24, Lenovo finalized and put into use an ESG management system called Lenovo ESG Navigator that helps monitor key ESG metrics in manufacturing. The innovative system offers near real-time insights on greenhouse gas emissions and energy use, replacing traditional manual management of ESG metrics with a flexible, transparent, and highly automated approach that captures data across the value chain from a single point of control, enabling more data-informed decisions in areas impacting sustainability performance.

Innovating to help customers meet sustainability goals

Lenovo is focused on providing products and services that help contribute to customers' sustainability goals and a smarter future for all. Through focused initiatives at the product, packaging, and service level, Lenovo is innovating to improve the sustainability features of products and empower customers with options to consider sustainability through services.

Product and packaging innovations that focus on carbon impact

The latest generation of Lenovo Neptune™ liquid cooling technology is delivered in a broader range of ThinkSystem servers than prior generations, making its sustainability benefits available to more of Lenovo's customers. Lenovo Neptune™ liquid cooling technology helps to optimize product performance by capturing up to 98 percent of the system heat and reducing power consumption by up to 40 percent.

In addition to product innovations in its servers, Lenovo takes a holistic look at customer experience and sustainability goals by improving packaging design across product offerings. The Infrastructure Solutions Group uses a rack integration method of shipping servers with pre-installed in racks, saving 105 pounds of cardboard per rack. Lenovo designs select PC packaging for it to be made from more sustainable materials like bamboo and sugar cane.

Empowering customers with more sustainable choices

Lenovo provides IT life cycle solutions such as Asset Recovery Services, CO2 offsetting capabilities, Reduced Carbon Transport options, and certified refurbished equipment. All of Lenovo's products are offered as-a-service, a delivery model which can help optimize IT asset sustainability.

TruScale Everything-as-a-Service: Circular Economy is all about designing out waste from the value chain. TruScale ‘as a Service' offerings optimize the process by leaving each stage of a product's cycle in the hands of qualified professionals so a customer can focus on their productivity priorities. TruScale inserts predictability into lifecycle management, enabling companies to plan and help maximize the reuse or recovery of their technology.

Asset Recovery Service: This service helps mitigate the environmental and data security risks associated with end-of-life asset disposal while aiming to maximize the value potential of those assets, with the main goal to reutilize, recover, and in the end, recycle resources.

Reduced Carbon Transport: This new solution empowers Lenovo's customers with transportation alternatives for IT purchases that generate lower carbon emissions, such as those that allow the purchase of Sustainable Aviation Fuel credits.

Innovative solutions for a circular economy

Lenovo's vision to deliver Smarter Technology for All extends to its practices that include Smarter Circular Design, Smarter Circular Use, and Smarter Circular Return activities. In a circular economy, products are made, used, then returned, instead of being discarded and consigned to waste. In this model, value is extracted from a resource while in use. Then, at the end of its service life, the resource is recovered, refurbished, and redeployed. This drives greater resource productivity, aims to make businesses more competitive, and helps create new opportunities for growth. The demand for a more circular economy has given rise to the ‘as a service' or usage models seen across many industries in which the users pay for only what they need when they need it, and return the assets or resources when they are finished.

Lenovo provides innovative solutions for its customers' business needs that help reduce the volume of end-of-life electronic products that may otherwise, be discarded or consigned to waste. These solutions include:

Services that help keep products operating longer;

Services that help make infrastructure management easier;

Solutions to manage its customers' products at the end of life to help maximize value and reuse opportunities.

Lenovo's introduction of TruScale Device as a Service (TruScale DaaS) to the PC industry has helped enable organizations to maximize value throughout a product's lifecycle and minimize raw material use and waste generation. TruScale DaaS is a usage model in which the consumer pays to use the device of their choice as they need it and has the option of pausing or returning the device when it is not in use. Along with the device, Lenovo offers a variety of services that aim to protect and support the asset during its lifecycle. When the device reaches the end of its service life, Lenovo will collect the device, wipe it clean of the customer's data, and strive to recycle and re-purpose the device. This means the device can either be refurbished and reintroduced into a new working environment, or the device's parts can be used to repair other devices under warranty.

Customers only pay for what they use, avoiding the heavy capital outlays of the ownership model, as well as escaping the burden and cost of disposal. These services are addressing the industry's transformation to as-a-service and providing lifecycle value to Lenovo's customers.

To help scale circular economy solutions in the IT industry, Lenovo has established a target to enable the recycling and reuse of 800 million pounds of end-of-life products by FY 2025/263. For more information see Section 9.0.

Conducted by the International PtX Hub, and organized by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GIZ) in partnership with Evonik and Geo bio gas&carbon, this event highlighted the growing importance of SAF in driving the aviation industry’s defossilisation efforts. The training course was designed to support and strengthen the ecosystem of the SAF sector in Brazil, featuring a comprehensive programme led by Torsten Schwab, Director Technology of the International PtX Hub. Schwab, a prominent expert in sustainable fuels, guided the audience through key aspects of SAF technology, regulatory challenges, and funding opportunities, emphasising how renewable energies can revolutionise the production of sustainable aviation fuels.

Key Highlights of the SAF Training Course

The course covered a wide range of essential topics to provide a well-rounded understanding of the SAF sector:

Global Overview of SAF: Participants gained insights into the global need for sustainable aviation solutions and the key challenges the industry is facing.

Technological Routes for SAF Production: A deep dive session delved into various technologies used for SAF production, including HEFASAF, ATJ-SAF, Methanol to SAF, and FTS-SAF (Power-to-Liquid, Biogas-to-Liquid, and Biomass-to-Liquid).

Certification and Regulation: Participants were introduced to the ASTM criteria and procedures for SAF certification and the international regulations surrounding its use.

Financing Models and Economic Viability: Representatives from BNDES and GIZ presented financial incentives and support models for SAF projects in Brazil, offering a roadmap for economic sustainability.

Case Studies and Practical Examples: The event also featured real-world case studies, providing a valuable glimpse into the ongoing initiatives and opportunities in Brazil.

Interactive Sessions and Networking: Participants engaged in dynamic discussions and networking opportunities, fostering the exchange of ideas and the formation of strategic partnerships.

A Collective Effort for Defossilising Aviation

SAF represents one of the most viable paths towards the ‘de-fossilisation’ of aviation and requires a joint effort by companies, governments, and research institutions to scale its production.

Hendrik Schoenfelder, CEO Evonik Brazil

The assessment of Schoenfelder is more than right: Since most SAFs are still carbon-based – due to the CO2 used for their production – they cannot contribute to decarbonisation, but rather to defossilisation of the industry, that is, the avoidance of fossil feedstock for the new fuels (read more about Defossilising aviation with e-SAF). Schoenfelder noted further, that this event offered a valuable exchange of knowledge and underscored the aviation sector’s growing interest in adopting sustainable solutions. Gustavo Castro, Evonik’s Catalysts Business Manager, added,

Evonik is committed to offering innovative solutions that support the transition to more sustainable energy. We see the SAF market as a great opportunity to drive forward the energy transition by providing catalysts, adsorbents, and membranes that enable the use of renewable raw materials.

Gustavo Castro, Catalysts Business Manager at Evonik

Building Partnerships for the Future

Beyond technical discussions, the event served as a platform for exploring investment opportunities and fostering collaboration to advance SAF production in Brazil. GIZ promotes both public and private sector funded projects in this field. ‘We are proud to support the development of Brazil’s SAF sector,’ stated Dr. Bernd dos Santos Mayer, Coordinator of the Green Hydrogen Innovation Component at GIZ Brazil. He elaborated on the importance of the first SAF project in Brazil, which involves a partnership with Geo bio gas&carbon to create the country’s first commercial-scale plant for Syncrude production from biogas. This sustainable process, utilising biomass waste as a source of biogenic carbon, is a promising solution for SAF production and has the potential to fuel both domestic and international markets. The Fuel for the Future Law further underscores Brazil’s commitment to sustainability by promoting innovation and advancing the energy transition.

This partnership can boost an entire sector, contribute to the sustainability and decarbonisation of aviation, and generate economic growth, jobs, and a just energy transition. We hope this training inspires more companies to pursue SAF production projects across the country.

Dr. Bernd dos Santos Mayer, GIZ

Looking Ahead: The Future of SAF in Brazil

The SAF training course was a significant step toward building a sustainable aviation fuel sector in Brazil. It not only provided valuable insights but also facilitated the creation of vital partnerships that will help shape the future of aviation in the country. Trainer Torsten Schwab:

About ten years ago we started to reflect on SAF for niche scenarios in the remote areas of Brazil. Today we see Brazil at the forefront to contribute to clean aviation globally, being it with SAF or sustainable commodities such as e-methanol, which are becoming urgently needed for various value chains.

Torsten Schwab, Director Technology of the International PtX Hub

As more initiatives take shape and innovative solutions are developed, Brazil is poised to play a leading role in the global transition toward sustainable aviation. As the industry works together to make SAF production more viable on a large scale, the event served as a reminder that collaboration, innovation, and strategic investments are key to achieving a sustainable and decarbonised aviation future.

In March, AEF responded to a Department for Transport consultation on the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) revenue certainty mechanism (RCM). The RCM is being introduced to reduce the risk of SAF projects to encourage investment and development of a UK SAF industry. The government has confirmed their intention that this mechanism will be funded by industry, with this consultation looking at the exact format of this industry funding.

The RCM will take the form of a guaranteed strike price arrangement whereby a set price will be determined that SAF producers will receive when they sell their SAF product (a strike price). Producers then sell SAF at the market price and if this market price is below the strike price then producers are reimbursed with the difference. Similarly, if the market price is above the strike price then producers pay the difference back into the system.

This consultation proposes to place a levy on fuel suppliers that will cover any costs of the RCM (e.g. reimbursement payments that are due to fuel producers and costs of operating the scheme).",https://www.aef.org.uk/aef.ico,N,,2025-04-10 19:57:10.886178

Full transcript - 15th Annual LD Micro Invitational 2025:

Unidentified speaker: Made polyethylene, polypropylene, and stuff like that. Purity tracking is a business that tracks carbon through the whole value chain. It’s a SaaS business using the TLT technology. So we could track where did the carbon come from, how did it get here, what energy was used during production, all the way, for instance, to see if it ever improved. So the question is, well, you know, to buy you buy a jet fuel, how do you know it’s different?

That matters. That makes us a different game than that we’re a developer. We have a huge amount of technology, huge number of patents. I don’t have a roster So we are in an unusual position for a developer, and we have a strong balance sheet with several hundred million dollars on the balance sheet and cash. And so we’re in unusually solid position They call it instead of sustainable aviation fuel, they’re calling it synthetic aviation fuel, which is actually closer to the original name anyway, the ACM standards.

And so it’s one of these things that I think is being overlooked is that people are just, god. You know? It’s all things carbon are bad. No. Actually, it isn’t about that.

About it creates jobs. It’s potentially cost effective, competitive, with petrogenic, except for it’s made from your resource. Oh, and it makes carbon too and creates a lot of jobs. So it’s a little bit different game to play in different paradigm. One of the things that’s really important that we always drive home is that this is a scatter plot, jet fuel price versus oil price.

EVOS are just a scatter. And an integrated ATJ plan that we’re talking about is the green one there on the lower side, lower left. It’s cost competitive. I’m not joking. You can make it from renewable resources and still be cost competitive on a production cost base.

Photosynthesis makes a carbohydrate. We take the carbohydrate, make it into an alcohol by fermentation. Then we do chemistry, make it into ejecta. We’re capturing not just the carbon hydrogen, but all the electrons too. Everybody forgets that when they do the analysis.

Instead of having to mandate electronics, now we’re getting them from photosynthesis directly and keeping them and preserving them throughout. That’s why we have such an advantage. This is a economic curves or or bar charts against competitive technologies. Boils on the left. Our ATJ 60 economics are the one next to it there in the second from the left.

The gray is the cash cost production, the capital requirements to get good returns are the light green. But you can see why I’m seeing the cash cost reduction, we can be in the hunt with Metro. I find that astounding on fundamental level, fundamental economic level, we can be cash cost. But how do we deal with capital is the question. And you can see that we think you can lower it going forward at as we learn how to do realistic built EPC, you know, projects that has this the old fashioned way that, like, boost up cost.

And then import adds cost. They are disadvantaged. You have smaller plants that have fibers made for vegetable or waste cooking oil and things like that. We’re up about half of their cash cost of production. That’s a fundamentally important point.

Half of, though, is the one that’s mostly sold by companies like Nestea, and people like that, kind of renewables. So we like the fundamental position at the capital is the issue. One of the things that you see on this thing up from this about CI score is our CI score to be below zero. Why? We’re capturing renewable carbon, goes through the system, we get the new renewable electrons that come with it.

The ground. That’s biogenic c o two into the ground. And doing that, that creates value. So you get from actually lowest cost of carbon. Spoke free is what the customer of that would be.

People that’s voluntary. That’s in addition to the regulatory work. It’s what people get wrong about our company frequently is that they all it’s all about alright. 45 z. No.

It’s not. That’s one part The other part is a state park. The other part is rigs. Oh, and on top of that is the bottom tier.

We just announced yesterday a deal with a company in Europe who’s collecting and buying the carbon separate from the jet fuel. And I think that’s actually how this market’s gonna unfold. So jet a, it’s just jet a. It gets valued as jet a, and then we sell the carbon separately. That’s how it’s gonna work.

And then this is what I just described. These are all the kind of customers that we talked to. Just lots of them. So it’s a it’s a developing market. We can get Phil Knight, the science guy up.

He’s interested in this. He heard me talk and learn about this. Because it’s different paradigm. Who who heard of a cost effective approach Well, this plant is the lowest carbon intensity plant that we’re aware of in for ethanol production. That mean that turns into money and allows us to capture value from 45 z.

So here’s another thing that gets wrong that the industry gets wrong or the. 45 z is a law. It’s not getting undone. It is not getting undone. Sorry.

Too late. We’re already partway in the year. It’s included in this the bills that are being is a system of carbon traffic and trace. It really is tracking everything because how do you look. Here’s analogy to this cup.

It’s cup. Look at this cup. It’s better. Why? It’s plastic cup.

How do I know if it’s from renewables? How do know if it’s made from renewables? I said so. Proof where the carbon came from. That’s our belief.

That’s how you create value. Think of it as a brand. Anyway, that’s what Garrett is about, tracking and tracing. We track it through all the manufacturing. We have that operating already at the testing it out in plants.

We’re working with existing ethanol plants and soybean plants. We’re already working to make sure that we can measure the energy, give direct real time CI scores along as we manufacture stuff. So we think the future we think consumers ultimately are gonna wanna know, something for that money? Think did I get something for it? That’s actually what the game is about.

I met RNG. This is a we have 400,000 BTUs. We built this ourselves. We didn’t like EPC it is also we can take any these building blocks. We can make propylene with technology.

Propylene, we would deal with LG Chem in Korea to do these kind of technologies. And there’s also we can do these too. Again, how do you if you made these for renewals, how do you tell our different power back to? These all these pieces fit together with us. This will follow.

It won’t be the thing that drives. The fuels will drive it to develop the business So the question is how big is the market? How was the potential? Could it how big is the potential? That’s a really interesting question.

We were just talking about that. We’re looking at jet fuel. So jet fuel is projected It’s going to there’s a lot of room for growth here. And then when you consider that the ethanol industry is placed in the gasoline pool pool and as mileage increases, there’s less gasoline pool. NEDs will have an impact too, but it’s a there’s less it’s not growing.

And yet production can increase, and corn production can increase. So here in The States, we have a situation. We have an abundant amount of corn, and we can grow more on the same land. Ethanol is becoming overcapacity is overcapacity already, we can stop that up. So There’s a new.

Well, everything is wrong. Here in The States, we we could we don’t have to. We can use we’re the first to make economically? The the economics are advantaged here in The US. That’s for sure.

Way more than Capital cost for the plant. Two capital cost. So here’s the here’s what I don’t to push the cost down of the project. If I could build it myself and have the money to just build it, I’d be done. Other questions?

We already started working with airlines. We have. We have about we have several hundred million gallons of contracts already. They’re the problem with airlines are terrible to your old customers. They don’t have good balance sheets.

You can’t trust them. They don’t do long term off date agreements. It’s part of that game. The airlines are on a problem. That’s right.

So they and they can’t take pricing. That’s it. So this is the challenge. So remember remember, my plan was paid off. It’s competitive with jet fuel.

Straight up against the weather. Now if I get paid for that carbon value in some way in the marketplace, then I don’t need any government stuff, any credits. I don’t need anything. That’s what the future looks like. I would say so the question is, do we adopt is a new technology a new business model?

There are opportunities for incremental changes to technology? No. Today, we don’t need that. We just put it. It’s the business system that matters.

That’s what matters. It’s probably just our roadblock so far is all about financing. What’s the marketplace for car? Who’s gonna buy this stuff? Same questions.

They’ll insure they’ll buy all day long at the same price. Well, that’s. So who’s gonna pay their carbon value? That’s the question. That’s what we work on, and that’s what we have to establish.

And that takes real things. And in this space, there’s so much hype and BS. It’s a mind boggling, which is kind of magical stuff. It’s gonna save the world. No.

No. He’s a giant. Two two two billion pounds of corn. Okay? 2,000,000,000 pounds of corn was a no plant.

It makes 1,300,000,000 pounds of animal feed, 60,000,000,000 gallons of jet fuel. Think about that. That’s like a truckload of stuff every four minutes. You know? Think about the scale of these things.

According to the EPA, food waste makes up 24.1% of material sent to landfills, making it the largest category of municipal solid waste.
When it comes to managing food waste, landfills are not the way to go.
Not all food can be composted, so it doesn’t manage a large portion of food waste.
Food waste is a major cause of greenhouse gas emissions, but seeing local indigenous communities implement ways to find benefits from processing food waste inspires hope for the Pacific Northwest at large.","If you take the highway south out of Walla Walla and keep going for about an hour, just before reaching Pendleton you’ll pass by the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR). Within the CTUIR, scientists are taking huge steps toward a sustainable future, particularly in regards to food waste management.

According to the EPA, food waste makes up 24.1% of material sent to landfills, making it the largest category of municipal solid waste. This causes major problems since the decomposition of organic matter in oxygen-free environments generates methane, a greenhouse gas that poses more danger to our climate than carbon dioxide. Modern landfills are usually built with impermeable liners and capped once they reach capacity, which cuts off landfill waste from oxygen exposure. This means that when food waste is left to decompose in landfills, it just contributes to methane emissions in the atmosphere. When it comes to managing food waste, landfills are not the way to go.

Sustainable alternatives are crucial. Composting is a popular option. It’s a process in which organic materials are set aside to decompose into a carbon and nitrogen-rich soil product, sometimes colloquially referred to as compost-tea. When done properly, this method reduces (but does not eliminate) methane emissions and produces a result that works great as fertilizer. Many major cities in the Pacific Northwest, including Seattle and Portland, have even implemented city-wide composting.

It’s a decent way to handle food waste, but it doesn’t come without downsides. Not all food can be composted, so it doesn’t manage a large portion of food waste. Unless a compost pile has generated a significant amount of heat, many energy-dense items such as meat, dairy and oil can’t be composted. Additionally, large-scale composting sites often deal with contamination, making the product less useful. Fortunately, it’s not the only solution.

CTUIR’s new project, “Nixyaawii, Don’t Throw It Away!“ presents an alternative that’s potentially even more efficient: anaerobic digestion.

“It works a lot like how our stomachs digest things,” said Colleen Sanders, a co-director of the project. “We use our teeth to break up living matter, and then we swallow it again in anaerobic conditions, where microbes will break it down and release the nutrients … both in a physical form [and] gaseous form.”

Like composting, anaerobic digestion involves microbes aiding in the decomposition of organic matter and results in a physical product that can be used as fertilizer. Unlike composting, anaerobic digestion does not reduce methane production. Methane gas is a natural byproduct of the process, but the methane is caught before it can be released into the atmosphere. With this project, the methane is then refined and used as energy.

“We call it renewable natural gas because it is a methane gas that comes from the decomposition of living materials. So it’s not coming from a fossil fuel. It’s coming from materials that already exist and are within a harmonious carbon cycle on the land,” Sanders said.

The project was initiated by DeArcie Abraham, owner and operator of BioWaste Technologies LLC. She is a gardener and enrolled tribal member who noticed the need for waste management techniques within the community.

“I was a composter originally,” said Abraham. “I started composting with worms … the microbiology they put out when they process waste was interesting to me. I ran into some anaerobic digestion information, but I didn’t ever dream of my tribe picking something like that.”

It wasn’t until she brought her ideas to Sanders, who works within CTUIR’s First Foods Policy Program, that the ball started moving on the project. In collaboration, Abraham and Sanders secured a grant from the USDA to kickstart the process.

“The anaerobic digestion came about because of the EPA food waste hierarchy,” said Sanders.

The EPA’s food recovery hierarchy is a useful guideline in terms of the ideal use of the food supply.

“With extra food, you should feed hungry people first, and then you should feed hungry animals, and then you should use it for industrial purposes, and then you should compost it, and at the very bottom, it should go into the landfill. I was curious about what those industrial uses would be,” Sanders said.

The process itself is quite simple, but the project has a number of pieces to it. Once food waste is collected, it is taken to the Áq’paš (pronounced “ak-paash,” which translates to “stomach”) where the anaerobic digestion takes place.

“There’s an inlet where you put your waste … and then there’s an outlet where the output of the wastewater or compost-tea will come out. On the top of [that] bag is where the gas will collect. The bag then will go through a scrubber [which] will scrub out some compounds that make the gas dirty. That will clean the methane so that [it] is a pure form. [A] hose will connect to either a stove or a generator that will convert the gas into electricity,” said Abraham.

The process is seasonally dependent since the microbes that facilitate digestion thrive in warmer temperatures. This meant that the Áq’paš could not begin operations during the winter months. But as of March 5, the system is up and running.

“We had to postpone starting the Áq’paš until the temperature outside has reached about 40 degrees at night,” said Sanders. “We were a little bit saddened that we weren’t able to start the Áq’paš earlier, but this is what it means to be seasonal. Sometimes, you have to wait for the appropriate time for something to happen.”

Inevitably, colder seasons will limit the productivity of the Áq’paš, but now that it’s started, Sanders and Abraham are hopeful that it can maintain enough momentum to operate continuously.

“It’s a little bit like a beehive,” said Sanders. “If you get it robust and get it going through the winter and provide a little bit of buffering for it, there’s a good chance it can make it through.”

The Áq’paš is located in a building set up near the Mission Longhouse, which is a key tribal community center.

“A lot of stuff happens in the longhouse,” said Allen Zamudio, an enrolled CTUIR tribal member and first-year Whitman student. “Feast, memorials, powwows, culture night … there’s usually food involved. Sometimes they’ll make fry bread for the powwow. Sometimes for memorial services or namings, you’ll have food afterward.”

This project location makes it easier for the community to engage with the project and for those working on the project to gauge how the community feels about it.

“While we’ve waited for temperatures to become hospitable for our Áq’paš, we’ve been gathering information and making sure that our community is comfortable with what we’re doing,” Sanders said. “A lot of times the longhouse cooks have also expressed a desire to be better with working with the stuff that gets thrown away as part of events.”

As the program gets off the ground, support from the broader region will be needed to help keep the system alive.

“It’s definitely a regional effort. We know that we as a tribe probably don’t generate enough to sustain a large-scale facility,” said Sanders.

The “Nixyaawii, Don’t Throw It Away!“ project is a promising strategy for food waste management, and it is still in its infancy. Right now, there are still many unknowns. It will be exciting to find out how much energy will be produced or how the Áq’paš will handle seasonal changes.

It is also just one piece of CTUIR’s moves towards sustainability. Zamudio has noticed other small changes being made as part of these efforts.

“The tribe started distributing reusable utensils for people to bring so that we’re using less plastic. I don’t know how often people actually use them, but it is a new thing that’s been introduced to the community,” Zamudio said.

In today’s world, the uphill battle towards a sustainable future looks steep.

Also, Treasury should include emissions rate pathways for biofuel derived from corn kernel fiber and sorghum kernel fiber and provide the option to segregate those gallons for 45Z credit generation purposes.","In detailed comments submitted today to the U.S. Treasury, the Renewable Fuels Association urged the department to clarify and improve several key provisions in its upcoming proposed regulations for the Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit, often referred to as the “45Z credit.” The comments were submitted in response to the Treasury’s January 10 “notice of intent to propose regulations” for 45Z.

“If properly implemented, the 45Z tax credit has the potential to advance U.S. energy security, prioritize domestic energy resources, strengthen rural economies, and create a transformative incentive for the adoption of new technologies in the renewable fuels and agriculture sectors,” RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper wrote to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. “The technology-neutral intent of 45Z represents the most economically efficient and environmentally responsible approach to boosting U.S. energy production. However, for the 45Z program to truly drive innovation and value creation in the marketplace, Treasury must move expeditiously to propose, finalize, and promulgate implementing regulations. Clean fuel producers, including RFA’s members, are in desperate need of clarity, certainty, and stability in the regulatory framework supporting the 45Z tax credit.”

Cooper added that RFA believes the final 45Z regulations must recognize the realities of today’s biorefining and agriculture sectors and the complexities of our nation’s transportation fuels marketplace. At the same time, final regulations must maintain an intuitive and manageable approach to registration, reporting, and recordkeeping that creates the kind of dependable value that empowers businesses to invest.

Among RFA’s comments:

Treasury needs to clarify its intentions and definitions around “qualifying sale,” an “unrelated person,” a “member of a consolidated group,” and the applicability of safe harbor provisions.

Treasury’s approach to rounding of emissions factors should be reconsidered.

Treasury should formally integrate climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices into the 45Z program.

Treasury should modify Prevailing Wage and Apprenticeship (PWA) requirements.

Treasury should expeditiously implement the Provisional Emissions Rate (PER) process and allow a more flexible approach.

The short duration of 45Z, and Treasury’s delay in promulgating rules, is discouraging innovation and investment and undermines the objectives of the program.

The proposed structure for 45Z creates an unintended disincentive for the production of alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

In response to specific questions from Treasury, RFA commented that the 45ZCF-GREET model offers a far more current and thorough understanding of lifecycle emissions than either CORSIA or the approved pathways under the RFS program. Also, Treasury should include emissions rate pathways for biofuel derived from corn kernel fiber and sorghum kernel fiber and provide the option to segregate those gallons for 45Z credit generation purposes.",https://ethanolrfa.org/image/1759/1000/treasury+bldg.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 12:57:18.947678

The global biodiesel market is valued at USD 49.05 billion, based on a comprehensive five-year historical analysis. The market growth is primarily driven by increased adoption of renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, favorable government policies like blending mandates, and rising crude oil prices that push demand for sustainable alternatives.

The market is dominated by countries like the United States, Germany, and Brazil due to their strong regulatory frameworks, advanced infrastructure for biodiesel production, and abundant availability of feedstock. The United States benefits from its Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS), while Germany leads in Europe with its focus on decarbonization policies. Brazil's dominance is fueled by its agricultural sector, which provides an ample supply of soybeans and other feedstocks.

Global Bio-Diesel Market Competitive Landscape

The global biodiesel market is highly competitive, with key players leveraging their extensive supply chains, advanced technology, and strategic investments to maintain dominance. The market is characterized by a mix of multinational corporations and region-specific players, each focusing on innovation and sustainability.

Technological Advancements: Biodiesel production has improved significantly with technologies like Crown's ACRE, which optimizes transesterification to save catalysts and energy. Pyrolysis technology also enhances the process by allowing a variety of feedstocks to be converted into biodiesel, making production more sustainable and cost-effective. These advancements are crucial for increasing both the efficiency and sustainability of biodiesel production.

Increased Demand for Sustainable Energy: Biodiesel is gaining traction due to its role in reducing carbon emissions, especially in the transportation sector where it's used as an alternative to traditional diesel fuels. This is driven by growing environmental concerns and climate change awareness. In the transportation sector, companies like UPS and FedEx have integrated biodiesel into their fleets to reduce carbon emissions and meet sustainability goals.

Market Challenges

Feedstock Availability and Sustainability: Biofuels from agricultural crops compete with food production for land, posing potential food security issues. The cultivation of biofuel crops can lead to deforestation, biodiversity loss, and water depletion if not managed sustainably. For Instance, in Indonesia and Malaysia, large tracts of tropical forests have been cleared to plant palm oil, which is a key feedstock for biodiesel. This has led to significant biodiversity loss and increased carbon emissions.

Economic Viability: Producing biofuels involves high costs for growing, harvesting, and conversion, often exceeding those for fossil fuels without subsidies or technological advancements. Many biofuel projects depend on government subsidies to remain economically viable, leaving them vulnerable to policy changes. For Instance, the U.S. biodiesel industry has experienced fluctuations in production linked to the expiration and reinstatement of the biodiesel tax credit, demonstrating how dependent the industry is on government financial support.

Global Bio-Diesel Future market Outlook

Over the next five years, the global biodiesel market is expected to exhibit significant growth reaching a market size of USD 77.50 Billion by 2031 fueled by government mandates for renewable energy usage, increased investments in advanced biofuel technologies, and rising awareness about carbon footprint reduction. The transportation and power generation sectors are likely to witness the highest adoption of biodiesel as governments worldwide aim to achieve decarbonization targets.

Market Opportunities

Growth in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): The global biodiesel market is experiencing significant growth, driven in part by the expansion ofSustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)production. With new mandates from the EU and Japan, SAF is increasingly being integrated into existing refinery setups through co-processing technologies, which offer competitive costs and facilitate the transition to greener fuels.

Diversification of Feedstocks: The diversification of feedstocks is another key trend influencing the biodiesel market. Non-edible oils are gaining traction as viable feedstocks, particularly in Europe and the U.S., which supports long-term production capacities and sustainability goals. The increasing use of these alternative feedstocks helps mitigate competition with food resources and enhances the overall sustainability of biodiesel production.

Last year, SAF production volumes reached 1m tonnes, double the 0.5m tonnes produced in 2023.
But SAF accounted for just 0.3% of global jet fuel production and 11% of global renewable fuel.
The shortfall comes as key SAF production facilities in the US pushed back their production ramp-up to the first half of 2025.
This year, SAF production is expected to reach 2.1m tonnes or 0.7% of total jet fuel production and 13% of global renewable fuel capacity.","Aviation’s drive to net-zero emissions by 2050 faces several challenges, not least in funding the ambitious target.

IATA forecasts an average of $128bn in annual capital expenditure will be needed for the airline industry to reach its net-zero goals.

Describing the $128bn forecast as a “best-case scenario”, IATA notes that it is “significantly less” than total investments in solar and wind energy markets between 2004 and 2022, which it puts at around $280bn.

Part of the capital will go towards building new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) refineries that are central to the sector’s net-zero road map.

“The costs and challenges associated with the energy transition are large, but the opportunities are even greater,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice president of sustainability and chief economist, at a sustainability event last year.

“Countries have an opportunity to build new industries in agriculture and energy, and to benefit from the catalytic growth impact of sustainable air transport.”

IATA continues to argue that the airline industry cannot be expected to fund new facilities, particularly given its long history of thin profit margins.

The association expects extra costs of $1.4bn to the global airline industry from procuring SAF in 2025, but notes this could rise to $744bn by 2050 once SAF usage is more widespread and other fuels such as hydrogen come into play.

Meanwhile, IATA labelled the growth of SAF production as “disappointingly slow” in 2024. Last year, SAF production volumes reached 1m tonnes, double the 0.5m tonnes produced in 2023.

But SAF accounted for just 0.3% of global jet fuel production and 11% of global renewable fuel. This is significantly below previous estimates that projected SAF production in 2024 at 1.5m tonnes.

The shortfall comes as key SAF production facilities in the US pushed back their production ramp-up to the first half of 2025.

This year, SAF production is expected to reach 2.1m tonnes or 0.7% of total jet fuel production and 13% of global renewable fuel capacity.

IATA director general Willie Walsh says: “SAF volumes are increasing, but disappointingly slowly. Governments are sending mixed signals to oil companies, which continue to receive subsidies for their exploration and production of fossil oil and gas.

“And investors in new generation fuel producers seem to be waiting for guarantees of easy money before going full throttle.

“With airlines, the core of the value chain, earning just a 3.6% net margin, profitability expectations for SAF investors need to be slow and steady, not fast and furious.

“But make no mistake that airlines are eager to buy SAF and there is money to be made by investors and companies who see the long-term future of decarbonisation.

“Governments can accelerate progress by winding down fossil fuel production subsidies and replacing them with strategic production incentives and clear policies supporting a future built on renewable energies, including SAF.”

Critical importance

SAF has a key role to play in helping the aviation industry achieve net zero emissions, so its importance cannot be understated.

In total, IATA estimates that 65% of the net-zero target will be met through the use of SAF, with 13% coming from hydrogen and electric propulsion, 3% from more efficient operations and 19% through offsets and eventually through carbon capture.

Away from SAF, IATA is also focusing on reducing plastic waste in air cargo operations, reducing perishable loss along the supply chain, and driving sustainability and efficiency in cargo handling.

To reduce plastic waste, IATA is helping the industry cut the amount and thickness of plastic sheets and stretch wrap with a plastic sheet sizing chart, plus it is developing procedures for the adequate reutilisation of plastic sheeting. The association is also promoting the use of reusable alternatives.

IATA has additionally developed procedures for adequate segregation and recycling of waste.

On perishables loss, figures from The Food and Agricultural Organisation estimate that $940bn is lost in food production each year. And 14% of this figure is lost in distribution, which results in significant greenhouse gas emissions.

To help reduce loss, in December 2023 IATA produced guidance on perishable loss in air cargo to help companies reduce waste during transport.",https://d1m8zjqyxnlv3j.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/9/0/7/10907_greenfuelaircraft_photo_scharfsinn_shutterstock_2270822133_493124.jpg,N,,2025-04-10 11:57:31.630445

Karen Walker:

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Window Seat Aviation Week Air Transport Podcast. I'm ATW, an Aviation Week Network Air Transport Editor-in-Chief, Karen Walker. Welcome on board. Now this week I'm absolutely thrilled to be joined by somebody who I think of as a friend in this industry definitely. It's Grace Cheung, who is the general manager of sustainability at Cathay Pacific Airways. Grace, it's great to talk with you again.

Grace Cheung:

Hello, Karen. Hello, everyone.

Karen Walker:

Hi. Hello. Now Cathay Pacific, of course is based in Hong Kong, has a long legacy, one of the world's oldest airlines, and I'm just going to quickly put this in. I must, it's very important. Cathay Pacific has also just been named the Air Transport World 2025 Eco Airline of the Year. So congratulations to you, Grace, and of course the entire Cathay team. Being Eco Airline of course in this day and age is a very, very prestigious title. So well done. Now, sustainability, as I said, it's a very big topic in this industry, and so this is what we're going to be talking about. Grace, can you just kick us off please? Sustainability, we've had this conversation a few times, but it can't be one person, obviously. It can't really even be one airline, of course. We've sometimes talked in terms of looking at sustainability like safety, everybody's got to be involved. But as an airline, can we start off by hearing from you, what does Cathay see as the most important issues to address when it comes to sustainability? What are your priority focus areas?

Grace Cheung:

Thank you, Karen. Our next sustainability really we see as the core DNA of Cathay, because what we said is our brand's purpose is to move people forward in life. And when we talk about people, it's not just customers of today, but also our customers in future. And to ensure we are able to do that, sustainability really is a key component. So from our perspective in terms of environmental sustainability, we see two priority area. First and foremost, it's definitely around climate change, because of the jet field we use. On the other hand, material circularity economy is also very important. This is all the material our customers and our people came along when they fly with us during the customer journey, that they feel most relational and kind of really close to resonate with their own experience.

Karen Walker:

So yeah, I think that's an important part to these days. Everybody of course talks about decarbonization reducing emissions and carbon in the air. That's sort of obvious. It's also very, very difficult. But there's another very important element of this is, as you say, reducing waste and using lighter recycled materials. I've seen at Cathay, this is obviously a very important part of why you won the award, is that you take that holistic view across all parts of Cathay. The cargo side, the low cost carrier, HK Express, obviously the main Cathay Pacific Airline. But you take that very seriously I think in terms of it's got to be the whole deal, the whole package. Does that sound right?

Grace Cheung:

Yes, thank you, Karen, and you understand what we have been doing very well. So thanks for that. So in terms of material circularity, I think first and foremost we put our effort in reducing single-use plastic, because when we talk to our people, our customers, it seems to them that this is the first and foremost items in their mind that they really expect Cathay as a group to do something about, in terms of reducing our single-use plastic usage as well as finding ways to reduce the environmental impact as and when we must still use some of those items. Because to be honest, plastic is good in certain way. It's light, so for climate change perspective, it reduces the weight of aircraft and reduces carbon emissions, and it's versatile. And when we were very concerned about hygiene and the protection of goods, and customer journey is still is of good use.

So the question is can we find good quality replacement where we can, so reduce the use of plastic, as well as replacing those that are originally maybe single-use by replaceable item. So I think we follow along those lines in those direction, both replacing a lot of our single-use plastic. So previously back in 2018, when we first did our baseline research, on a per passenger basis, it was over seven pieces per passenger faces, single-use plastic at that time. After first round of reduction, we brought that down to about half, after the first three years reduction period. And our new latest target is to bring that further down to 1.5 pieces of single-use plastic per passenger by end this year, 2025. And at the same time we are also looking at increasing the ratio of remaining plastic item to use recycled plastic as a source material, as well as improving our own in-house recycling rate as well. So really creating a closed-loop economy model to encourage our upstream and downstream partner to join us in that journey.

Karen Walker:

And that was the other thing that struck me when we were looking at the detail for this award was you also seem to have a really good mindset of goals and targets, and measuring things. You don't just sort of say, ""Oh yeah, we're really good at this."" You've got numbers and statistics. Measuring this is very important, yes?

Grace Cheung:

Yes. I think I forgot which management guru, but someone has said this wise word of if you can't measure something, you can't manage it. So I think actually sustainability is a lot about data and management. Without a fact we can't move forward. So I think that's part of the groundwork we've been working on very hard to make sure we get the right data, so as to identify weak links and to move on from there.

Karen Walker:

Absolutely. Now can you talk a little bit about the collaboration and partnerships behind everything that you do when it comes to sustainability? That's within Cathay of course, and outside with your partners. What is happening there?

Grace Cheung:

Yes, I think collaboration is one key pillar we see and actually we like to quite greener together, because we believe that no one can really say they are green. I think every decision we make, whether it is for businesses or for individual, every decision will have some impact on the environment. The question is, can we make more conscious choices so that our decision is a greener one? And there's always room for improvement, so we can never be green enough. And this, really sustainability topic is so complex, no single organization or individual can do it alone. So only by working together we can all go greener together. So that really encapsulates our belief and approach in sustainability. So in Cathay we work on various sustainability topic, we truly believe in working with different stakeholders. So we talks a bit about single use plastic earlier, but then I may be able to talking about our main focus, the use of sustainable aviation fuel, which we believe to be the most important lever in decarbonizing aviation in the next few decades, leading all the way up to 2050.

Sustainable aviation field is very challenging, because it's still in very early stage of its industrialization process. It needs lots of investments. So we need to engage the supply chain, all the way from where those sustainable feedstocks coming from, and financial institutions, banks on how and what would make them willing to invest in this important supply chain. And of course our customers as well, whether they see the value of the use of sustainable aviation fuel, or we call it SAF, in terms of their consumer choices. So that when working with airlines and the whole ecosystem, more SAF can be used to decarbonize the whole aviation surfaces. But all this could not happen if a supportive policy is not in place, because all these billions of dollars of investments and investors and the market needs certainty in place and only a long-term stable policy with supporting measures on all these fronts could make it happen. So we have been working very closely with all these parties along supply chain, just take side customers to make sure everyone do their part, so that together we can decarbonize the aviation surfaces according to plan.

Karen Walker:

You raised a couple of very important points there. The government policies and government support, we see that as you know, it differs around the world and it seems to change also, doesn't it? Especially when it comes to SAF. Can you talk a little bit, maybe give us a few specifics of who you think of as key partners, particularly in that SAF, how to get more SAF? Because as we know, as you said, the problem is there isn't enough of it, there's nowhere near enough of it at the moment, and what there is very expensive. And airlines of course are still recovering financially from the effects of the COVID pandemic. So this is all very important and it's all tied together. So who are the key partners for you right now?

Grace Cheung:

So I think one thing as airline we see we could help unlock that supply is to find the demand, and that's why at Cathay we have launched the first major corporate SAF program in Asia, back in 2022. So how it works, our scheme is that we work with our corporate clients, because we know many of them just like us, share the commitment and share the belief that we as corporates need to do something about climate change. So these corporates are usually quite big customers. They would have quite significant carbon footprint from aviation services, whether it is the travel of their employees flying around the world doing businesses or shipping of their cargo through air freight.

So these corporates would have a lot, quite a lot of scope free indirect carbon emissions incurred. And by working with them we basically offer them the opportunity to make financial contribution for the use of SAF, not waiting until 2030, but started right then from 2022 onwards to allow us as the airline to work with SAF supplier to start buying and using, and scaling up the use of SAF. Basically putting our words in action, telling the suppliers that there is real demand there and it's not just an empty talk, but with real money on the table and hopefully by all these collaborations we can help bring more SAF supply online.

Karen Walker:

Right, okay. It's interesting, this is my perception, but when aviation really started to talk very seriously about the decarbonization, setting goals, et cetera, and started to talk about how are we're going to get more SAF, it seemed to me at the beginning of this that it was really Europe that was leading the charge. And then the United States surprised everybody and seemed to really be getting into all of this, and really became a leader. It now seems to be that it shifted, Asia is really coming on strong in this. Now of course Asia was also longer coming out of the COVID pandemic, so there was that. But is that your perception too? It just seems to me like there's a lot of activity all of a sudden going on in Asia on this and is that because people expect it, your customers expect it, what's going on?

Grace Cheung:

So I do agree with your observations. I think a lot is happening in Asia currently around SAF and I observed that coming from different angles as well. First we talked about the importance of supporting policy and as you mentioned, the European Union or UK have already long sets their SAF-related policy and is already started implementing. And on the US side they have also implemented some supportive measure in terms of the research and development, and development of supply chain, et cetera. So in Asia in recent, not even years, but in recent months, we still see a lot of consultation happening in the market that different policymakers, different states looking at different potential ways to increase and encourage domestic SAF development, whether it's from the supply chain front or from usage perspective. So we consider that to be really active and positive sign that the momentum is also moving on in this part of the world. Besides policymakers, we also see quite a lot of actions in the supply side also.

Actually lots of study. He told us that Asia is a very good location for developing future SAF, because loss of the feedstock actually comes from the region, whether it is user cooking oil, I don't know, that may be something to do with Chinese cuisine. We do use a lot of user cooking oil and that could be the very good feedstock, but also other agricultural waste with the land and agricultural activities in the region. There's also lots of good supply for the long term and even for the further down the line, the power to liquid synthetic fuel, renewable energy is also kind of both cheap and in abundance, especially in China. So I think this region is really well positioned to be the future kind of powerhouse in producing SAF and it's great to see a number of those initiatives, and even started by individual investors kind of coming up here and there in Asia.

So that's really good sign. Last but not least is the customer front you mentioned. I think what we see is that since the launch of our corporate SAF program, we do see a lot of customers, not only the launch partners, but since we launched the program that they then came to us proactively, because there are partners looking for partner airline to have their SAF footprint in Asia. So I think that's also another good sign that we are seeing that there is interest, not only about using SAF in other better developed market, but to support specific initiatives taking part in Asia.

Karen Walker:

And that's good, because as you say, there's a lot of potential across Asia, vast area, different, but lots and lots of opportunity there in terms of its resources and people, but it's also of course it's still going to be one of the fastest growing regions in terms of aviation. So these things again need to be glove in hand, working together. So good to see. Let's get to the thorny issue here, which is we've talked about the lack of the supply of SAF in terms of how much is really needed, but also of course the cost of all of this. So as we all know, IATA set the 2050 net-zero carbon goal a few years back, but recently IATA's Director General, Willie Walsh, acknowledged it may not be achievable. IATA's put the cost of this transition to be around $4.7 trillion, huge amounts of money. What are your thoughts on this?

Grace Cheung:

I think definitely there is the economic issues that need to be tackled, but I think the way I see is that the good news is airlines shouldn't be the only one be in the picture, because I think it's through the supply chain and actually through or people taking part as part of this ecosystem, whether it's the user of the aviation service, supply chain, actually we are all in it together to meeting that decarbonization challenge. Of course our discussion have been focusing on SAF, but even other technology or even other upstream R&D to bring down the cost significantly. I think that's also important and that's really beyond what airline can see through as wind control. I remember before electric vehicle becomes so popular nowadays or even when we talk about solar panel, the cost for renewable energy, the estimate not even 10 years ago, the five years ago, I think we have never imagined the price of those cleaner solution can come down so much.

So I think IATA definitely has done their homework and done their study to come up with the cost estimate. And as I understand it, that's the best estimate based on the current day technology. But I think as we can learn from all the examples in front of us to significantly bringing clean technology to be widely scaled up, the true key to unlock that potential is on the new technological development to really able to make an economic case for that transition with those economic breakthrough. I believe that the cause for future SAF production, as well as potentially other technology required to decarbonize aviation would be within reach.

Karen Walker:

So that sounds to me that you feel is still confident that the industry will get there. It sort of has to, but despite the challenges, shall we say. I know that you and Cathay executives now spend quite a lot of time also advocating for this and reaching out wider. You are talking to the other groups and organizations, and other airlines around the world, et cetera, and you're going to conferences, et cetera. Are you still getting that feeling of confidence when you are out and about outside of Hong Kong?

Grace Cheung:

I think to be honest, I think it is not so much about confidence, but I think it's about conviction, or I think it's really about industry players that everyone that I have talked to, I've met with, we really, all of us working very hard to try to get it done. And I think there are lots of things that may not be in our control. For instance, whether it is the policy that we have been talking about or the development of this much needed technology, that's not something we can have control directly, but we know. We can't give up and we know we need to continue to work hard with all these different parties to make sure we all give it our best. If we give up now, there's definitely no way for it to happen. But if we keep trying one day it will be. And I believe one day we'll all be there.

Karen Walker:

Good to hear. I like that word conviction. I think we're going to need a lot of that with this issue. But as I say, fantastic to see what you're doing at Cathay, and congratulations again on being the ATW Eco Airline of the Year. Lovely to talk with you. Thank you for your time.

Grace Cheung:

Thank you again. And that has been a great recognition and a great encouragement to all of us here at Cathay, and thank you again.

It is seen as requiring large amounts of capital expenditure and a long development cycle. But this idea is out of date, says Julien Fredonie, head of Europe and Africa for Honda Xcelerator Ventures (HXV), the CVC unit of Japanese carmaker Honda.

“ I think there are some misconceptions on this specific field of venture development and investment,” Fredonie tells GCV on the CVC Unplugged podcast.

“Of course, if you think about space quantum fusion, very extreme cases, development cycles are very long. I think a lot of findings in some recent reports showed that the time to market, the time to return as an investment [for hard-tech], were very similar to other investment categories, and more traditional startups,” he says.

HXV’s European portfolio includes hard-tech companies like battery recycling startup Tozero, biogas energy generation company Reverion and sustainable aviation fuel producer Ineratec, the latter of which has for the past year been developing a power-to-liquid synthetic e-fuel manufacturing plant.

Exciting geographies

Fredonie says Europe is well placed for hard tech innovation, with its concentration of high-quality research institutes and engineering companies.

“ One of the specifics of Europe is actually this high decentralisation of the talents, therefore of the great startups. You have amazing startups doing amazing things, even in small villages sometimes,” he says

“I think Europe is very, very strong, very well equipped. A lot of great founders. The companies here attract attention now from VCs and CVCs from all around the world.”

There are still some challenges, Fredonie admits. “How to scale sometimes, how to think global from the very start. That sometimes can be a challenge. But in general, I think Europe is very well equipped to work on some of the big problems around energy transition, ageing population health, et cetera.”

Similarly, says Fredonie, Africa is an exciting and dynamic region partly due to its own widely distributed talent base, adding that even with something like the AI boom, Africa was ahead of the game, with AI M&A activity having taken place as far back as 2021.

“It’s a lot of very different ecosystems with very different hubs and languages. It’s a very complex ecosystem to navigate,” he says.

“Historically it has been a lot of business model innovation, entrepreneurs trying to fix value chains, which were somehow broken, and creating very interesting businesses around that.”

Narrowing funding gap

There is also reason to be optimistic about the narrowing of the notorious funding gap in deeptech – the fallow area between early-stage VC and growth-stage capital where startups tend to struggle.

“What we see in the latest reports is that CVCs in 2024 have started to come a bit later, so the average involvement was around the series B, whereas a couple of years ago, they were going more in the late seed and series A.”",https://globalventuring.com//content/uploads/2025/04/BACKGROUNDS-FOR-HERO-IMAGES-2.png,N,,2025-04-10 09:56:35.784970

The document outlines policy proposals for their legislative term until early 2029, with the agreement paving the way for CDU head Friedrich Merz to be sworn in as Germany's next chancellor in early May.

The parties agreed to stick to Germany's 2045 target to become climate neutral, to reduce energy prices to increase competitiveness and ramp up investments in the country's ailing infrastructure.

Key climate and energy plans in 2025 coalition agreement

Climate policy and energy targets

Commitment to German and European climate targets

Emissions reductions are needed to reach climate neutrality, as well as offsets and, ""to a limited extent, through highly qualified and credible CO2 reductions in non-European partner countries""

Support EU target for 90 percent emissions reduction by 2040 if CO2 reductions in international countries can be counted to meet three percentage points of Germany's own reduction goal

Stick to the agreed coal phase-out deadline of 2038 at the latest

Carbon pricing is the central component for climate protection and competitiveness

Pragmatic implementation of the circular economy strategy

Give CO2 revenues back to households and industry

""Additional” efforts would be made to achieve “permanent and sustainable” negative emissions, with Direct Air Capture is mentioned as a “possible future technology” to contribute to this goal.

Industry and business

Introduce a ""Germany fund"" worth at least 10 billion euros of public money for investments in the country

Prices for companies and households should be reduced by at least five cents per kilowatt hour (average power price in 2024 was 41.2 ct/kWh for households and 20.5 ct/kWh for non-households).

The electricity tax will be cut to the European minimum and grids and levies be reduced as well, ideally with a permanent cap on grid fees.

Energy-intensive companies that cannot be supported otherwise and lack flexibility in adapting their operations will get access to a special industry power price.

Create lead markets for climate-friendly products through quotas for low-emissions steel production or public procurement regulations

Continue with funding programmes for the decarbonisation of industry, including ""climate contracts""

Support projects for the extraction of critical raw materials in Europe + create a national raw materials fund

Steel industry is of central strategic importance for Germany, “we will keep it and make it future-proof, and support it in the transformation of production processes on the way to cliate neutrality”

The parties reject the splitting of Germany’s uniform power price bidding zone.

Germany’s national Supply Chain Act (Lieferkettengesetz) will be abolished and replaced with a law on international corporate responsibility that implements the EU’s due diligence directive CSDDD.

Lead markets for climate friendly or climate neutral products should be established through quotas for the low-emission production of steel, a green gas quota or public procurement regulations.

Renewables and power system

Renewable power installations should be made ready to fully finance themselves on the market. The further expansion and the installation of adequate storage capacity likewise should be achieved through “a greater use of market instruments.”

Support should be made more conducive to stabilizing the power system by integrating storage units and feed-in mechanisms. Private household should get easier access to installing solar PV and the dual-use principle, for example for agriculture and solar power, should be expanded.

Spatial needs for wind power will be re-evaluated for the time after 2032 and nearby communities better integrated in planning procedures. Direct access options for citizens and companies should also be strengthened. Cooperation with North Sea neighbour countries should be intensified to achieve an optimised installation pattern for offshore wind turbines.

Up to 20 GW of new gas-fired back-up power plants should be built through “technology-open auctions as soon as possible.” The plants should be constructed at existing plant locations to balance regional needs. Reserve power plants in the future no longer should only help bridge supply gaps but also serve to regulate power prices.

A “technology-open and market-oriented” capacity mechanism should provide a “system-supporting technology mix” of including bioenergy, combined-heat-and-power plants, storage units and flexibility options.

Cooperation mechanisms for renewables expansion between the states and the federal government will be continued to facilitate Energy infrastructure planning. The principle of reduced environmental regulation for the construction of renewables will be assessed to also accelerate the construction of other infrastructure needed for the energy transition.

Hydrogen, carbon capture

Ramp up the hydrogen economy, using all colours in the run-up (for example hydrogen produced with renewables, nuclear, gas)

Adopt legislative package ""immediately after the beginning of the legislative period"" to enable the capture, transport, utilisation and storage of carbon dioxide (CCS/CCU) for industrial processes where emissions are hard to avoid, as well as for gas-fired power plants

Enable CO2 storage offshore in North Sea continental shelf as well as onshore ""where geologically suitable and accepted""

Direct air capture is a potential technology for negative emissions

Transport

“Clear commitment” to the car industry and jobs, based on “technology neutrality”

We welcome electrification of vehicle fleets, but reject legal quotas

Not mentioned in the text: Reversal of 2035 EU combustion engine phaseout, speed limit on the country’s motorways

“We will support e-mobility using purchase incentives” and additionally via: tax incentives for company and private electric cars, exempt e-cars from car tax until 2035, support programme for low income households for switching to e-mobility, support for plug-in hybrids and electric cars with range extender

More support for broad rollout of charging infrastructure for cars and trucks

Support for a “hydrogen charging” network for trucks

Check how to support switch of existing car factories to armament production

Increase rail investments

Speed up rail electrification

Make driving licenses cheaper

Support walking and cycling as part of sustainable mobility

Speed up permitting of heavy duty road transport

Move more freight transport from roads onto rails

Reverse aviation tax increase

Immediately abolish aviation power to liquid quota that exceeds EU rules

Ensure that European airlines are not disadvantaged in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) quota

Buildings and heating

Introduce a ""new buildings energy act"" (Germany's law to phase out oil and gas boilers) that is ""open to technology, more flexible and simpler"" to modernise Germany's heating supply. ""Achievable CO2 avoidance is to become the central control parameter""

Simplify communal heat planning

Continue to subsidise renovation and heating systems

Strengthen urban development, combat vacancies and adapt city centres and social infrastructure to climate change

Use the potential of serial and modular construction to speed up construction

Introduce end-of-waste regulation to increase the use of recycled construction materials

Draw up an action plan for bio-based building materials and an action plan for energy-intensive building materials

Incentivise simple, climate-friendly construction through funding programmes by state bank KfW

Establish a federal research centre for climate-neutral and resource-efficient construction together with the federal states of Saxony and Thuringia, secure permanent funding

Develop Building Information Modelling (BIM) as a central instrument for the digitalisation of the construction industry

Implement the European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), extend implementation deadlines

Climate adaptation

Implement the climate adaptation strategy, use existing funding programmes

Put financing for climate adaptation ""on solid footing"" with federal states, examine making this a ""joint task""

Accelerate flood and coastal protection measures

Implement prioritised measures of Germany's water strategy and continue to develop it further

EU and international

Support the introduction of ETS II, ensure a smooth transition from national carbon pricing to European system from 2027

The agriculture sector will not be made subject to the EU’s ETS 2 regulation.

These sustainable fuels can directly replace conventional kerosene made from fossil fuel with no need for adaptations in aircraft or supply infrastructure, facilitating the immediate decarbonisation of air transportation.

The new facility, located at the Holcim factory in Villaluenga de la Sagra (Toledo), is designed to capture over 700 000 tpy of CO2 during cement production. Part of this CO2 will be combined with green hydrogen produced from renewable energy to be converted into sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF), reaching an estimated production of 100 000 tpy. The remaining CO2 will be stored permanently in geological repositories.

The combination of technology and production capacity for the fuel of the future of aviation positions ECO2FLY as a leader in Europe for the decarbonisation of key development sectors considered difficult to decarbonise. In this context, Over the first 10 years of operation, ECO2FLY will avoid emissions of over 6.5 million t of CO2.

Ricardo de Pablos, CEO of Holcim España, said, “This strategic alliance between IGNIS P2X and Exolum represents a decisive step forward as part of our commitment to the transformation and decarbonisation of the industry. Not only are we making progress on reducing the carbon emissions of our own processes, but we are also driving a key innovation for construction in the form of cement with a total carbon reduction”.

In this regard, Ignacio Casajús, Global Strategy & Growth Lead at Exolum, highlighted how “Exolum is making a firm commitment to the development of partnerships that allow the development of sustainable fuels that, as of today, are presented as the only viable solution to reducing carbon emissions in the short term in sectors like aviation and shipping”.

José Antonio Membiela, CEO of IGNIS P2X, considers this project “the most important in the production of synthetic aviation fuel currently produced in Spain, both in terms of size and strategic location and the circularity it offers partners (energy, CO2 capture, methanol production and consumption in aviation). ECO2FLY combines the sustainability of a business of great important to the surrounding area, such as the cement industry, with the creation of new industry for decarbonisation, which will generate employment and wealth for the region.

For his part, Javier Esteban, Director of the Consortium and Partner of P2X Spain, states that “this project is an opportunity to be leaders in Europe in the production of eSAF, which represents an enormous strategic value for the Spanish economy. It will be the start of a new industry that will create employment and wealth, and a new energy paradigm for the country, with the opportunity to become exporters of renewable fuel on a large scale for the first time.”

Laia Barbarà, Head, Climate Strategy - Net Zero, World Economic Forum: Aviation is one of the greatest humankind inventions. However, our most important journey just yet is to decarbonize the sector.

Robin Pomeroy, host, Radio Davos: Welcome to Radio Davos, the podcast from the World Economic Forum that looks at the biggest challenges and how we might solve them. This week can air travel ever be environmentally sustainable?

Justin Erbacci, Director General, Airports Council International World: To have aviation become more sustainable is a very complex topic. Nobody in the industry can wave a magic wand or work very hard and accomplish carbon neutrality or sustainability by themselves. They really need to have everybody in the industry working collaboratively.

Robin Pomeroy: We hear about the technologies that could decarbonise aviation.

Paul Griffiths, CEO, Dubai Airports: One of the ways forward is clearly sustainable aviation fuel. At the moment, however, this only accounts for 0.7% of the total fuel production. That means that the entire SAF production would be consumed in 50 hours during the course of a whole year.

Robin Pomeroy: We speak to a company that is making jet fuel using carbon dioxide emitted by industry.

Ayesha Choudhury, Chief Commercial Officer, Infinium: You're taking that CO2 from a steel mill, from an ethanol plant, from a pulp and paper, from oil refining. We're capturing that and we're using that as our feedstock

Robin Pomeroy: Follow Radio Davos wherever you get your podcasts, or visit wef.ch/podcasts where you will also find our sister programmes, Meet the Leader and Agenda Dialogues.

I’m Robin Pomeroy at the World Economic Forum, and with this look at how we make aviation sustainable…

This is Radio Davos

Robin Pomeroy: Welcome to Radio Davos. And this week we're talking about sustainable aviation. And later in the program we'll be hearing from the person who runs one of the world's busiest airports, from a company that makes aviation fuel by using carbon captured from industry, and from the head of the global airport organisation, the Airports Council International.

And to co-host this episode on sustainable aviation, joining me is Laia Barbarà. Hi,Laia. How are you?

Laia Barbarà: Hello, Robin. Happy to be here with you.

Robin Pomeroy: Tell us what you do at the World Economic Forum.

Laia Barbarà: So, Robin here, I head the climate strategy team, which includes the sustainable mobility work that we do, including in particular the aviation de-carb portfolio that we're going to be talking about today.

Robin Pomeroy: And you were telling me before, you've got a background in aviation.

Laia Barbarà: Yes. I'm not only an aviation geek, but also an aerospace engineer by background..

Robin Pomeroy: Perfect. So but you cover a lot of industries, though, in your brief. So give us an idea of why aviation is important when it comes to global carbon emissions and, you know, the energy transition and all that.

Laia Barbarà: So aviation is one of the greatest humankind inventions, right? It allows the economy to grow. It allows families to get together, cultures to be exposed to others. And businesses are being made through meetings of people travelling by air oftentimes.

However, our most important journey just yet is to decarbonize the sector.

And if we look back, we can see that the transition from coal to oil to gas took us around 60 years. And the bad news is that we cannot afford another 60 years to decarbonize the aviation sector now.

So we get to look at what are the low hanging fruits while we develop the more permanent solutions.

Robin Pomeroy: As we'll hear in those three interviews that I mentioned earlier, there are actually lots of ways to approach decarbonising aviation or making aviation sustainable. I mean, what would you say are the most important or the most interesting ones?

Laia Barbarà: If you allow me, I'll start by sizing the problem that we're trying to tackle here.

So on one side, sustainable aviation just five years ago was an oxymoron pretty much for everyone. And today we already have solutions deployed at scale. So that's that's already a good a good start.

And then on the other side, if we look at the air traffic growth, we know that it is projected to double by 2042. And just to give you an indication and how it looks like, the forecasted traffic this year, it's expected to exceed the 12 billion passengers. So that's what we're talking about.

And then you were asking me what are the solutions? Well, now that we know the challenge, I think that the solutions, first of all, starts by understanding that the problem is not flying. The problem is CO2. So how can we tackle the CO2? How can we decouple it from this growth that is projected while we continue flying and exploring this beautiful world.

So we have short-term solutions and long-term ones, and we have we got to do a bit of a choreography to balance them and change from one to the other.

What is available today? Today you can fly on certain percentages of sustainable aviation fuels. You may have heard of SAFs. That's how we refer to them.

Robin Pomeroy: Yes. And in fact, we're going to hear quite a few acronyms from these. SAF is the one that keeps coming up, sustainable aviation fuels. You'll probably mention a couple of others now.

Laia Barbarà: Exactly. So SAF today. But it's it's not the perfect solution just yet because we need more SAF and better quality SAF. But it's available today and that's something very important to have to flag.

Then we have what we call destination technologies, the true zero technologies. And those are basically categorised in two big buckets. One, electric aviation. We know that it is possible. We know that hopefully within the next decade we will have some examples in place. But shorter range, less autonomy, less passengers, probably so not fit for purpose for every single type of travel.

Robin Pomeroy: Like battery-operated planes.

Laia Barbarà: Exactly. And then on the other side, the hydrogen sister solution. And this is two-fold: hydrogen fuel cells or hydrogen-fuelled aircrafts. And then those may allow you to have greater autonomy, bigger distances, greater ranges, but probably will penetrate the market just a bit later on.

Robin Pomeroy: Now, the reason we making this episode right now is because you produced this paper called the Global Aviation Sustainability Outlook. Tell us what that is.

Laia Barbarà: So we just learned during Aviation Day in our headquarters here in Geneva, this 2025, our flagship sustainable aviation report that basically tells CEOs how to go about it.

So the issue is as follows. There are many solutions. Not of them are available now. However, CEOs and big decision makers need to make investments today that will lock them up into a particular solution for the next decade, if not longer, right? Depending on the type of assets they're investing in. So we want to help them. We want to shed some light into what are no regrets moves, while we also give a snapshot of where is the sector today when it comes to their companies. And, b, what are the main risks that CEOs perceive? So after having interviewed more than 40 CEOs from the industry, we know I can reveal to you and please, I encourage you to go read the paper as well, that one of the biggest top of mind problems risks that a CEO see is the lack of feedstock availability and the cost of this feedstock to create the so-called SAF, sustainable aviation fuel.

Robin Pomeroy: There's this kind of a chicken and egg problem, isn't there, that an airline might want to buy this fuel, sustainable aviation fuel, but it's not being produced in enough quantities and at a cost that is really affordable. But then the companies making that need to know there's a market there. I suppose that's maybe where the World Economic Forum comes in, because it brings together, famously, the stakeholders of one end and the other, as well as regulators and governments.

Laia Barbarà: Exactly. So we're trying to break the eggs and make a tortilla, if that, if that makes sense. And how do we do that? So we basically get together, as you were saying, everyone along the value chain. And that includes stakeholders from airports, from airlines, from freight forwarders as well as financiers, the fuel producers, but also the suppliers, literally everyone, policy makers, international organisations, industry associations. We've got to do a joint choreography in order to achieve the, the decarbonization of this sector. Because if there's one certainty, Robin, it is that in 2025 politics may have changed, but science has not.

Robin Pomeroy: Let's talk a little bit about the politics. Particularly in the US. Climate action is certainly kind of off the agenda, to say the very least. But aviation is a global thing and US firms are involved globally and as we'll hear, the company, the one particular company we talk to that makes sustainable aviation fuel is making it, as we'll hear, in Texas, oil country.

This is a long term thing. Climate change is a long term problem. Aviation if you're in it, is a long term investment. You buy planes that will last 20,30 years. Airports, building them decades, decades in advance. So is that why people are not turning away from climate action, even if right now, as we speak, it's not the most fashionable thing let's say.

Laia Barbarà: A very unique thing from aviation is that it is a global business by nature. Because let's say that the country a does not supply these sustainable fuels, but then the plane will land elsewhere. And if these other country does supply the fuel, they will refuel there, right? So yeah, then the emissions happen in the atmosphere, which technically do not necessarily belong to a given country.

So I think that just by definition, it is a very global business. It's a global problem and we should try to avoid, and that's something that the World Economic Forum through our Airports Of Tomorrow initiative, we're trying to contribute to and advance the agenda, is to avoid having a patchwork of policies whereby every single country imposes, sometimes even contradictory policies when it comes to the decarbonnization of the sector. So trying to bring everyone onto this level playing field where we can just accelerate the decarb of the sector, because there's one thing you may want to take into consideration, which is we're not only trying to solve the problem of today, but we were saying at the beginning of this interview that air traffic growth is projected to double by 2042.

There's regions very hungry, flying and flying. It's a huge economic growth vector and catalyse the right. So think about the biggest economies in Africa. Think about Southeast Asia and Eastern Asia. The air traffic growth is going to happen there. It's just impressive. And they do have the means to actually produce this fuel. So it also comes as an economic opportunity in order to diversify their economy and reduce the dependency of kerosene imports, for instance.

Robin Pomeroy: Let's get to these interviews. I did these a few weeks ago at the thing that you mentioned. You had an event here at the World Economic Forum called Aviation Day, and this is your Spanish omelette, where you brought together all the ingredients from the industry. So what was that?

Laia Barbarà: So Aviation Day here in Geneva 2025. It was the second edition that we were doing this gathering here where we get CEOs, top executives from across the aviation sector. They are all members of our Airports Of Tomorrow initiative. So more than 80 stakeholders across the value chain.

And what do we do? Well, we try to discuss the speed and scale that we need to move forward and agree on concrete steps forward. So it's less of a ceremonial meeting where somebody tells you the answer and the great things they've done. But it's more of a collective brain power exercise that this executive conducting a closed door setting. So we're left very excited and hopeful.

Robin Pomeroy: So let's get to these interviews. And the first one is Paul Griffiths. He's the CEO of Dubai Airports. And Dubai's a pretty significant airport I think. Right?

Laia Barbarà: Exactly. So actually Dubai is the world's busiest international hub. I think this year they had record number of passengers with over 90 million passengers passing through the airport. Quite, quite impressive. And they also have plans to increase even this capacity further, up to 200 million passengers per year at Dubai International, a different airport in the city.

Robin Pomeroy: Yeah, he mentions that new airport that they're building. This is Paul Griffiths.

Paul Griffiths, CEO, Dubai Airports

Paul Griffiths: The key to making aviation sustainable is first to understand the scale of the problem.

The first point is that the aviation industry consumes about 1.08 million tonnes of aviation fuel every day, and in 2024 that grew by 68,000 tonnes per day. So it's a very, very big concern.

One of the ways forward is clearly sustainable aviation fuel.

At the moment, however, this only accounts for 0.7% of the total fuel production. That means that the entire SAF production would be consumed in 50 hours during the course of a whole year.

So you can see the scale of the problem.

What we're trying to do is encourage investment in sustainable aviation fuel. The global jet fuel market is worth about $254 billion per year. If we were able to put, say, $1 on every barrel of oil, that would make a difference of about 0.8% in the cost of fuel, then we could reinvest in SAF production to try and equalise both the cost and the volume production to accelerate it. Using Moore's Law, doubling the production of SAF every two years, it would take 7.7 years to get to 10% of total jet fuel being from sustainable sources. So it's a very big problem. It needs a big solution and it needs huge investment, which I believe could be raised somehow from the industry.

Robin Pomeroy: Would you say that it's more an economic or a policy question rather than a technical question at this point?

Paul Griffiths: I think there are three elements in making SAF a quantifiable problem-solver for the future.

I think, first of all, the industry and governments have got to work together to create a level playing field of investment that doesn't incentivise poor behaviour. In other words, if there is a levy on aviation fuel or on ticket prices such as applied in Singapore, just under 2 USD per passenger towards SAF production, then we could actually solve the problem if that was applied on a global basis. There are precedents for this. There's the Chicago Agreement, which agreed many decades ago that there would be no global tax on aviation fuel. If we could have a simple agreement to say this, a levy on jet fuel, then we could fund scale of SAF production. That, I think is the way forward.

However, this would result in costs having to be passed on to the consumer, but I think it's only possible and justifiable to say that really, the consumer should meet the fully sustainable supply chain costs of every good or service that we consume.

Robin Pomeroy: Now you represent an airport rather than an airline. So different priorities, different challenges. What are the challenges for an airport looking to become more sustainable?

Paul Griffiths: Clearly, sustainability in airport terms is limited to the emissions that we produce on the ground - about 10% of the total emissions in the industry.

There are many ways of actually achieving a sustainable ground operation. The first is to use electric vehicles throughout the airport environment, which is something that Dubai Airports, we're embracing.

The second is to concentrate on alternative energy sources. We've installed 62,000 solar panels across all the rooftops at Dubai International Airport. Those are producing 60MW of solar power.

We are controlling all of our production and cooling infrastructure so that we can consume significantly less electricity. We are engaging in predictive maintenance. We're aiming to send zero waste to landfill within two years. We've eliminated single use plastics. We are looking at all sorts of new nascent technologies to make the airport as sustainable as we possibly can.

My philosophy is, rather than setting a target, let us do a whole range of incremental movements so I can look month by month and see that we've actually made positive progress by not emitting as much CO2 as we did in the previous month. It has to be practical. There's no silver bullet and it needs a myriad of different solutions.

Robin Pomeroy: And where do airports come in when it comes to this transition to sustainable aviation fuels, what role do you play in that?

Paul Griffiths: The transition to sustainable aviation fuel is a complex one. And as airports plan decades ahead, it's going to be very difficult to understand exactly what's needed in ten years time. We are due to open our new airport, Dubai World Central – Al Maktoum International, within the next seven years. And the idea is to have a fuel infrastructure that will cater for whatever alternative aviation fuels, be it hydrogen, be it methane, be it sustainable aviation fuel grown from HEFA [hydrotreated esters and fatty acids] or from power to liquid, or the myriad of nascent technologies clearly have got to mature. We've got to look at encouraging innovation and development at scale in this area and be ready to accommodate whichever solution emerges as the chosen one.

Robin Pomeroy: Do you think there will be a solution that emerges as a chosen one. because there are, you just listed, a lot of them there. They're almost competing, I suppose, at the moment. Do you imagine they'll be in ten years time? Oh, it will seem obvious. We should all put all our bets on solution A. Or do you think in ten years time, they'll still be a whole range of ways of powering aircraft?

Paul Griffiths: I think what is going to happen with energy transition is we'll go through a number of phases. And clearly there is from the present day to the future, where we've got to use a drop-in fuel to work with existing aviation technology and existing aero engines.

Clearly, SAF is the one that looks as though it's going to be in the near-term the best way of achieving that.

However, in the longer term, methane and hydrogen look as though they could be better alternatives, either in hydrogen fuel cells powering electric engines - and there are now already some very powerful, self-sustaining engines powered by hydrogen that could perhaps power a 50-80-seat aircraft, so that technology is very interesting. So I think the thing is, there will be a solution that takes us incrementally from where we are today. But in the longer term, there's likely to be an emergent energy source that will be the front runner.

In any engineering solution there's usually one long term winner. And if I was asked to say where we going to go, I think probably hydrogen has the greatest promise.

Robin Pomeroy: Do you think consumers will notice this change? And do you think consumers are asking for this change?

Paul Griffiths: I think it's inevitability that consumers will have to respond and understand that aviation may not be quite as cost effective, because today we are clearly not absorbing all the costs necessary to make aviation completely sustainable. It has to be met from a source and clearly if it's spread across the whole world, consumers shouldn't notice too much difference if the cost of sustainability is embedded into the aviation supply chain.

Robin Pomeroy: That was Paul Griffiths, the CEO of Dubai Airports. Let's get straight to the second one. We are moving continents from the Middle East. We're going over to North America and this is Ayesha Choudhury. She is the chief commercial officer at a company called Infinium. What does Infinium do?

Laia Barbarà: So Infinium is an innovator a company that it's producing sustainable aviation fuels that what we call e fuels, which is basically synthetic aviation fuels the type of high quality stuff that exists today, less mature technology pathways. So it comes with higher risk, higher technology demands, but also a higher sustainability criteria. So very exciting to see them growing and taking off.

Robin Pomeroy: This is Ayesha Choudhury of Infinium.

Ayesha Choudhury, Chief Commercial Officer at Infinium

Robin Pomeroy: So sustainable aviation fuel, what actually is it? I'm imagining it's a lot of different things potentially.

Ayesha Choudhury: You're absolutely right. It is a lot of different things potentially. But at its core, however you make it, it's a drop-in fuel. It's chemically identical to its fossil fuel counterpart, jet fuel, but it comes with a much lower carbon footprint.

There's a lot of ways that you can make it. Some are more technologically advanced than others.

Today we have very little of this stuff, and what little of it there is is made from used cooking oils, fats and greases. That's kind of like the first generation of SAF.

There's new and emerging pathways, one of which is power to liquids or E fuels, E being electricity. That's what the E stands for in E fuels.

What we do is we make SAF, the same product chemically identical to the fossil fuel. So you can use it in the same planes. You can distribute it in the same exact way as regular jet fuel, but make it with a more than 90% greenhouse gas savings. We do that because we're making it from renewable power, water and waste CO2 that otherwise would have been in the atmosphere.

Robin Pomeroy: Could you kind of talk us through in non-experts terms how this stuff is made?

Ayesha Choudhury: Yeah, absolutely. So basically, jet fuel is a chain or set of molecules that are made from hydrogen and carbon. The vast majority of the jet fuel that gets made today, that hydrogen and carbon comes from petroleum that we drill from under the ground.

But we don't actually have to get that carbon and hydrogen from the ground. We can find other sources for it.

So the source that we use is the carbon that's in CO2, and then the hydrogen that's in water. And we have a process, you know, a fancy sausage machine, a lot of very important technology and technological innovation that went into it, but very simply, you put those two ingredients and there's a way to break up those molecules and put Humpty Dumpty back together in the exact formation of jet fuel.

Robin Pomeroy: We hear a lot about hydrogen as a fuel as well, which is different from this. So you could, and probably the first step that you were talking about there, splitting hydrogen out of water. But the problem there, I suppose, is that you can't just put that into a jet engine, right?

Ayesha Choudhury: Not yet. I mean, that's something that people are working on. And hopefully there's a path for that and there's a long future.

But you're absolutely right that hydrogen is where the power is, if you will. And what we're doing is we're synthetically creating that hydrogen from the water and the CO2.

We're able, because we're making a molecule that looks and feels exactly like jet fuel or almost like it, it can go into the same plane. So the big difference here is that there is no changeover for the fleet that's required. There's no changeover in the infrastructure. You can essentially increase a lot of asset life of existing infrastructure, where lots and lots of people put investment into this, by using this method of decarbonising.

It's a circular solution. So if you asked how does it work when you use the fuel, you combust it in an aeroplane engine, just like you would do the fossil fuel stuff. And so it'll emit CO2 because it's chemically identical. It's going to work the same way. The difference is that the CO2 that it emits, one way to think about it was going to be in the atmosphere anyway. So what you're doing as a part of our process, you're taking that CO2 from a steel mill, from an ethanol plant, from a pulp and paper, from oil refining, there's lots and lots of sources of CO2 emissions. We're capturing that and we're using that as our feedstock. So you're not adding more CO2 to the environment that there wouldn't have already been.

Robin Pomeroy: And I think you use the expression a drop-in fuel.

Ayesha Choudhury: That's right.

Robin Pomeroy: What does that mean exactly?

Ayesha Choudhury: Drop-in fuel. Really what it means is that it's the same thing as the other stuff. So you don't have to have any changes to the engines. You don't have to change the planes. You don't have to change over your fleet. Plans are expensive, and we use them for decades before we swap them out or retire them. So the idea that you can have a fuel that works exactly the same way, handles the same way, but it's not made the same way. So you can get it with a lower carbon footprint.

Robin Pomeroy: It sounds amazing. Why are we not all flying using this fuel right now. What are the problems?

Ayesha Choudhury: One day I hope we will be. That's for sure. That's a vision for the future.

What this particular type of SAF, this power-to-liquid SAF, offers is the ability to scale that the other pathways don't have.

We should make everything that we can. Let's be honest. Decarbonisation of aviation is a massive challenge. There's a lot of stakeholders involved. There's a lot that we have to do. It requires a lot of scaling.

Why aren't we all doing it now? Today it's more expensive than fossil fuel. Now fossil fuel, it has its own set of subsidies. So there's a lot of debate as to like what's parity and what's not. But leaving that aside, today, all of the SAFs, all the ways that you can make it, are more expensive than today's fossil jet fuel. One of the things that we work on at Infinium is to bring down the cost.

We look at every aspect of how we can do that. We continue to invest in R&D to see if we can have a cheaper process. We run the world's first operating facility making E fuels today in Corpus Christi. So we'll have on the ground experience learning how to do this, how to optimise processes, how to make this, again, as cheaply as we can.

And we're building more facilities that are larger in scale, where you can get some economies of scale. We're doing everything we can to bring the cost down, but certainly it's not something that's happening overnight.

Robin Pomeroy: If the money was there to invest in this, it could be scaled up now.

Ayesha Choudhury: Yeah, actually, you know, I don't think the bottleneck is money. There is lots of money for good deals. We have capital commitments from a number of our investors who are there to fund the next plants and the next plant after that. They're all very interested in deploying capital to do this because there is, you know, people talk about the cost of energy transition. It's also an opportunity to invest, right?

I would say the large bottleneck to scaling is more about regulatory certainty and the types of bankable off-takes that capital partners need in order to actually finance these facilities. They're not cheap to build. They cost hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars, even so, having revenue certainty in addition to de-risking the technology, demonstrating that yes, it's new, but it works.

And we have this plant in Corpus Christi which is showing that it is very real, that it's integrated with other parts, other technologies, and it all works from soup to nuts. And that at the end you get the fuel that you can put straight into a vehicle.

You also need long term, predictable revenue, and that's partially coming from your off takers. But that's enabled by policy policy certainty saying that, you know, like for example, there's a mandate to use PTL [power-to-liquids] SAF in the UK, in the EU. That type of policy certainty is really important for off takers to be able to commit to the long term agreements that are necessary to get these plants built.

Robin Pomeroy: Tell us about your operations. What would I see if I came to your plant?

Ayesha Choudhury: If you went to go look at our plant, you would look at it and you'd say, oh, this looks just like any other chemical plant or oil refinery. There's lots of big metal vessels. There's lots of tubes. It kind of looks like any other petrochemical refinery.

Our plant in Corpus Christi is a full 24/7 operating facility. We have the full process safety management. You wouldn't know to look at it. Oh, these guys are turning sun, air and water into jet fuel.

So our first plant been operating for more than a year now. And our second plant is even bigger than that. And it's also in Texas. It's in West Texas. It's called Project Roadrunner. If our project in Corpus Christi was the world's first, this project Roadrunner is going to be the world's second E fuels facility.

We have capital commitments from Brookfield Asset Management, who's committed $1.1 billion to our platform overall. They're funding this project and they made a commitment to the next one even after that. Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, Bill Gates's climate fund, has also made a commitment to invest in this project. And of course, Infinium has a number of investors who are also indirectly in this project. And so we have an anchor offtake from American Airlines and IAG, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, a few more that aren't yet public.

But basically what we've been able to do is to start to scale up this industry to bring the cost down, and we've been able to do it with a commercial structure, long term feedstock agreements, long term bankable offtake agreements that attract the type of very, you know, large tech riders that are required to finance these types of very large infrastructure projects.

Robin Pomeroy: It's almost ironic, isn't it, that this is happening in Texas, you know, big oil country and also in the US, climate action is not really on the agenda of the current administration, but this is going ahead. What gives you the confidence that it can survive the variations in the political attitudes towards climate change and the energy transition?

Ayesha Choudhury: Sure. That's a really fair question. There's one thing to keep in mind when we think about Texas, or we think about doing these types of projects wherever they are in the United States, and specifically in a very red state like Texas. Yes, we are a sustainable fuel. Yes, we are a part of energy transition, but we're also bringing jobs to the area. We're generating economic prosperity in the communities that we operate in. We're creating resilient supply chains where you make fuels. There is a production pathway where you don't have to be in Texas. You make your own in a lot of places. So yes, the US is already energy independent because of our oil and gas reserves, but there's plenty of other places in the world where we can deploy this type of technology that don't have that. So energy independence and resilience are also an important part of it. But certainly in Texas we're bringing jobs and we think, you know, that that's part of it too.

Robin Pomeroy: Do you think this will expand in other parts of the world?

Ayesha Choudhury: Absolutely. We have a project portfolio beyond this plants one and two. We have more than a dozen projects in our portfolio. Some are in the public domain already. Our project pipeline is roughly 50% US, 50% rest of world. We have some projects that we're developing in Europe in particular, but certainly the technology is absolutely fungible. It can be done in a number of locations.

Robin Pomeroy: And you also need customers or offtakers. What's in it for them to buy this fuel which, I'm not gonna be crass enough to ask you how much more expensive per litre or gallon it is, feel free to tell me, but what is in it for them to buy this? And how do we know that demand is going to increase?

Ayesha Choudhury: Let's talk about our agreement with IAG, the owner of British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus. There's a mandate to use SAF, sustainable aviation fuel, in the EU. In the UK. There's actually a power to liquid sub-mandate as well. So in addition to just buying any old stuff, you have to specifically use power to liquids off or you face a major penalty. And so it's the policy certainty of the EU and the UK that gave IAG and the other offtakers that we're talking to the confidence to enter into a long term agreement because they know they have to buy this stuff. It may cost them more than the fossil fuel price, but if it cost them less than what the penalty might be for not doing it, there's a strong business case on their end.

Robin Pomeroy: You say, how important is the regulatory environment, that it's predictable, or also that it is supporting the development of sustainable aviation fuel. Are you confident, given the current international climate, that that will continue to support your business?

Ayesha Choudhury: It's a fair question. We live in a more uncertain and and dynamic world than we did before, certainly. It's obviously hard to make very long, large investment decisions in the backdrop of more policy uncertainty. So you're absolutely right that uncertainty makes it not just hard for us, but broadly for the entire industry to do stuff.

It's about scaling, whether it's our technology or whether it's others, we need as much of this stuff as we can get. We are going to need policy certainty to be able to scale up this industry. The good news is that with the scale in certain areas, costs will come down.

Robin Pomeroy: We're talking here at the World Economic Forum, discussions between the regulators, companies, academics even. And then you've got discussions, the international levels all the time thinking of the climate COPs, but also very importantly for the aviation industry, the ICAO. And there are talks going to be happening there. Are there things that you're expecting or hoping might happen in any of those fora which would be important?

Ayesha Choudhury: We want to sit at the table at all of these where policy is getting shaped and people understand the perspective of the producer.

We're in a unique position at Infineon. We have de-risked technology. We've proven that it works. We have investors who are waiting in the wings, ready to deploy serious capital to get these assets built and bend the cost curve.

One big missing ingredient that we need, whichever the policy body is, is continued policy certainty so that our customers can feel comfortable making some of these long term commitments.

Robin Pomeroy: Ayesha Choudhury, the Chief Commercial Officer of Infinium.

Let's go straight to our last, my third and last interview from your Aviation Day. This is the Director-General of Airports Council International World, ACI World, Justin Erbacci. What is ACI World?

Laia Barbarà: So ACI World basically represents more than 2,000 airports across across the world. And they have very strong work being done on the sustainability side of things. Actually, ACI, and Justin in particular, have been instrumental in the conceptualisation and and launch of of our Airports of Tomorrow initiative. They are our strategic partner and have been a great thought leader in getting it off the ground.

Justin Erbacci, Director General. Airports Council International World

Nobody in the industry can wave a magic wand or work very hard and accomplish carbon neutrality or sustainability by themselves. They really need to have everybody in the industry working collaboratively to really move the needle in this area.

We are doing a lot with our airports to to help them to figure out how they can become sustainable. And we have a carbon accreditation program that determines the levels of how well they're doing as far as becoming sustainable. And we work with them to help them figure out how to do that.

Robin Pomeroy: Can you give some examples of what airports are doing that is working to make them more sustainable?

Justin Erbacci: So airports are doing a lot. Airports were one of the first to commit to the 2050 carbon neutrality goal. We have the ACI Airport Carbon Accreditation programme, and there are five levels there, and we have about 600 or so airports that are already accredited, the highest level being level five. We have 19 airports who have already achieved level five.

So airports are mainly focussed in scope one and two areas of carbon neutrality, and that's where they can control what they do at the airport by electrifying their ground equipment, by building sustainable solutions, by making more efficient heating and cooling systems. So there are a number of things that airports can do to address scope one and two carbon goals.

Now, when it comes to scope three, that's where really you need the airlines to do a lot of work there. But airports are doing a lot to help to put in infrastructure that allows the use of SAF and other alternative fuels, and working very closely with the airline counterparts to try to put things in place to make the airport as sustainable as possible.

Robin Pomeroy: So SAF being sustainable aviation fuel. How much of a challenge is it that some of those technologies are still fairly much in their infancy. Is it complex like that for airports?

Justin Erbacci: The use of sustainable aviation fuel of itself is not complex. It is the production of sustainable aviation fuel that is the problem. It's not so much of a technology problem as it is a financial problem.

The manufacturers are ready to make sustainable aviation fuel and are eager to do so. But they need the commitment of the airlines and the industry to purchase that, so that they know that they can get a return on their investment. And that's a little bit challenging, because airlines and others are somewhat hesitant because of the fluctuation of the pricing and the uncertainty of pricing in the future to make long term commitments.

The other alternative aviation fuels electric aircraft, hydrogen aircraft, the technology is not there yet, and so it's very difficult for airports to put in the infrastructure that's required for hydrogen or for electric aircraft, when they don't know exactly what the technology is going to be, or even if it's going to come or when.

So that's another catch 22 that we help and put some papers in place to help our airports when they're doing their planning, to take into consideration the possibility of hydrogen and other fuels down the path. But it's still early as far as knowing when to implement that infrastructure.

Robin Pomeroy: An airport is usually a profit driven entity. It's providing services at a certain cost. What does he get from saying, actually, we are at the forefront of sustainability. Why would they do that?

Justin Erbacci: Well, there's many reasons why. One is that airports exist in a community. And as airports, we want to make sure that we are being good members of the community and trying to mitigate the impacts of air traffic as much as possible in the way of emissions and the way of noise.

The other aspect is, is as the industry grows and continues to grow, we will see that there will be a lot of environmental challenges from communities, from governments.

And so the airports and the airlines need to address these in order to make sure that the growth that we're going to see is going to be sustainable, and we're not creating a worse situation for the environment.

Robin Pomeroy: The Global Aviation Sustainability Outlook, what are we trying to achieve? The World Economic Forum and the partners who are involved in writing that report?

Justin Erbacci: The reason that we all get together at the World Economic Forum is for us to really move the needle in this area. We all need to work collaboratively together. Groups like the World Economic Forum helps us to get together, to have the dialogue, to understand where there's commonality, what are the issues that we need to push, and to gauge where we are in the pursuit of the carbon neutrality. Without these dialogues or these discussions with all of the stakeholders, we're not able to be able to make good path forward.

Robin Pomeroy: Can you give us any examples of those financial or regulatory things that would move the needle?

Justin Erbacci: We've seen that countries that have incented the production of staff have much higher production than those that don't. Pushing governments to provide incentives for that is very important. At some point, we have to figure out how we're going to pay for this. There are different potential ways that that can be done, but they will need regulatory change to either have, you know, some type of a tax or user fee, if that's the path that you want to go.

There is a lot of things that regulators and governments can do to help us achieve our objectives.

Robin Pomeroy: Are you confident that with that time horizon of 2030 or 2050, which are often the years set out in carbon neutral plans that there will be enough around the world support for these measures?

Justin Erbacci: So I think that these recent times we've seen that it's very uncertain as far as what type of support we're going to be getting from from governments and the geopolitical situation. It is very dynamic and changing a lot.

So I think that it's really important that all of us, as a group of stakeholders, continually remind governments and regulators what it is that we believe is necessary for them to do and just keep driving home that message to them to try to get them to take appropriate action.

And our commitment has to be unwavering. We have to make sure that even despite some of the geopolitical pushbacks that exist today and the uncertainty, that we don't veer from our goals and we remain committed to our goals.

Robin Pomeroy: Justin Erbacci is director general of Airports Council International World.

Aviation helps promote economic growth and cultural connection, but it faces a challenge – how can we fly more sustainably? Paired with other mechanisms such as acceptance of book-and-claim, R&D funding, grants and incentive mechanisms, policies like the UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate can help us get on the right track.

SAF is an important solution that is available now, commercially proven, and compatible with existing aircraft engine technology. SAF can reduce carbon emissions by up to ~80% on a lifecycle basis when compared to conventional jet fuel. However, time is not on our side. The UK SAF mandate, which officially came into effect in January, is an important policy that can help scale SAF. The mandate requires that SAF must make up at least 2% of all fuel used for flights departing the UK this year with targets rising to 10% in 2030 and 22% by 2040.

Meeting the mandate will be challenging. According to the UK Climate Change committee, SAF is expected to account for only 6% of total fuel demand by 2030, falling short of the targeted 10% and underscoring that the mandate alone will not get the UK SAF industry where it needs to be. To drive progress, the mandate mechanism needs to be paired jointly with other policy mechanisms and frameworks and focus on a wide range of technological advancements and operational efficiencies. In line with this, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) recommends a multi-faceted approach to working towards net-zero aviation by 2050. Their policy roadmap calls for a balanced focus on scaling SAF production, addressing infrastructure gaps, enhancing R&D, and driving diversification, scale-up and adoption of new technologies.

From regulation to action

The UK SAF mandate is a call to action for an industry under pressure to work towards net-zero goals. The convergence of regulatory mechanisms and incentives, expanded production capabilities, and increasing demand could signal a turning point.

Meeting SAF targets requires a concerted, industry-wide effort to continue to scale production, develop necessary infrastructure, and create supportive market conditions. The industry must work with all stakeholders including policymakers, fuel suppliers, travelers and others, to achieve this.

How businesses can lead the way

Compared to leisure travel, business travel is a highly influential and concentrated industry. On certain flights, business travellers account for just 12% of passengers but up to 75% of airline revenue, PwC found. This purchasing power, combined with the decisions business travelers make, places the industry in a unique position to help drive the scaling of SAF. In fact, this is already underway. By procuring SAF corporates can help accelerate the production and use of cleaner fuels and reduce their carbon footprint and set a higher standard for the entire aviation industry.

Corporations can fuel SAF adoption through the ""book-and-claim"" model, a streamlined financing and delivery mechanism that simplifies SAF distribution while ensuring accountability for corporate travelers. This model means SAF doesn’t need to be physically available at every airport. Instead, the purchased SAF is “booked” into the fuel system and can be “claimed” on any aircraft - the environmental benefits are still delivered without the additional cost and complexity of delivering fuel to a specific consumer.

Formal government acceptance of book-and-claim for SAF may help avoid additional costs and logistical complexities of importing SAF. Moreover, it may help drive corporate investment in domestic SAF production. Clear and consistent accounting and reporting standards are vital to unlocking long-term investment from corporates for the environmental attributes of SAF, as stated in a white paper by the World Economic Forum.

The journey ahead

While SAF is a crucial element in the journey towards decarbonising aviation, we need a mix of innovative policies and tools to get us there. These approaches include levers such as optimized flight routes and aircraft operations, continued progress in aircraft efficiency, carbon capture technologies, and carbon pricing. According to IATA, the route to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 will be led by SAF, but will also require a combination of new technologies such as electric and hydrogen, infrastructure and operational efficiencies, and offsets and carbon capture solutions.

With advancements in technology and increased investment from both the private and public sectors, 2025 can be a pivotal year for SAF progress. By working together, both governments and corporations can help accelerate the transition from SAF to being a niche solution to a mainstream norm.","http://www.travolution.com/dynamic-images/29000-29999/29908/29908_c=(0,476,6720,3528)_w=1200_h=630.webp?v=20230522122229",N,,2025-04-10 06:56:12.739352

Neste has successfully started producing sustainable aviation fuel (#SAF) at its renewables refinery in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, increasing its global SAF production capability to 1.5 million tons per annum, roughly 1.875 billion liters of SAF. 

“It is clear that we need to continue making progress in mitigating climate change and addressing aviation’s climate impact. Neste is fully committed to supporting its customers in the aviation industry to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, and this milestone underlines that commitment,” said Heikki Malinen, President and CEO of Neste.

The Rotterdam refinery has been modified to enable Neste to produce up to 500,000 tons of SAF per annum as part of the existing capacity. Neste also has SAF production capabilities at its refineries in Singapore, currently the world’s largest SAF production facility, and in Porvoo, Finland.

SAF is widely acknowledged as a key lever to reduce aviation emissions but policy support and close cooperation across the whole aviation ecosystem are required to accelerate the energy transition and related emission reductions.

A quiet yet transformative development is unfolding in the world of sustainable aviation. Gevo, a clean energy pioneer, and Future Energy Global (FEG), a market accelerator, have inked a multi-year agreement that has the potential to reshape how airlines and corporates approach carbon reduction. More than just an offtake contract, this is a glimpse into the maturing landscape of Scope 1 and Scope 3 carbon credits, harnessed through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Under the agreement, Future Energy Global will acquire the carbon abatement attributes from 10 million gallons per year of fuel produced at Gevo’s upcoming facility, the ATJ-60. These attributes cover both direct airline emissions (Scope 1) and the indirect emissions linked to business travel (Scope 3). With an option to increase this offtake volume later, the scale and ambition of the agreement reflect an evolving vision for decarbonization beyond physical fuel supply.

Book and Claim: Expanding the Reach of Sustainable Aviation

A noteworthy aspect of this collaboration is its emphasis on the book and claim system. Traditionally used in renewable electricity markets, this approach separates environmental attributes from the physical product. In aviation, this means companies can claim the emissions reduction benefits of SAF even if the fuel is not physically delivered to their location.

This model is crucial because SAF is not universally available at every airport. By decoupling the environmental benefits from fuel logistics, book and claim systems unlock access to a broader, global pool of SAF-derived carbon credits. This enables airlines and corporates alike to bridge the gap between sustainability ambitions and operational realities.

Financing the Future: Infrastructure Powered by Innovation

The commercial logic of this agreement extends well beyond environmental aspirations. For Gevo, the partnership with Future Energy Global provides critical momentum toward financing the construction of its ATJ-60 plant in South Dakota. Backed by a conditional loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy, alongside equity from project-level investors, the facility is designed to produce 60 million gallons of SAF annually.

What stands out is not just the facility’s capacity but its economic proposition. Gevo’s ATJ-60 aims to deliver SAF at a price comparable to conventional jet fuel, but with significantly lower carbon emissions. This parity is a pivotal step toward mainstreaming SAF in an industry where cost competitiveness remains a critical barrier to adoption.

Bridging Scope 1 and Scope 3: A Holistic Approach

One of the understated yet powerful features of this initiative lies in its dual focus on Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions. Airlines, as fuel users, are directly accountable for Scope 1 emissions. Meanwhile, businesses whose employees fly for work bear responsibility for their share of flight-related emissions under Scope 3.

Future Energy Global’s ability to serve both scopes enables a more comprehensive decarbonization strategy. By catering to corporates eager to mitigate travel emissions and airlines looking to align with net-zero targets, this partnership creates a shared value chain of accountability and action.

Scaling Ambitions: Meeting the Urgency of Demand

The aviation sector faces a steep climb toward its 2050 net-zero goal, with estimates suggesting SAF production needs to increase over 400-fold. This is not merely a technical challenge but a financial and systemic one.

Future Energy Global’s business model provides a blueprint for scaling SAF production responsibly. By pre-purchasing SAF credits and commercializing the associated carbon benefits, FEG generates predictable revenue streams. This stability attracts capital and encourages producers like Gevo to expand with confidence. It also grants buyers access to SAF credits at transparent prices, fostering trust in a market that is still gaining maturity.

Enabling Early Movers: Opportunities Beyond Aviation

While the initial focus is on aviation, the implications of this partnership reach further. Future Energy Global is already extending its sustainable fuel credit solutions to marine and land transport sectors. This diversification is vital, as global logistics and freight systems seek to navigate the complex path toward lower emissions.

Moreover, aircraft lessors—who own about half of the commercial fleet globally—stand to benefit. By leveraging book and claim systems, they can contribute meaningfully to emissions reductions, enhancing the environmental profile of their assets while supporting their airline customers.

Conclusion: An Evolving Landscape of Shared Responsibility

The Gevo and Future Energy Global agreement signals a pivotal shift in how industries perceive their role in decarbonization. Beyond merely supplying sustainable fuel, this partnership demonstrates the power of market-based mechanisms to accelerate the energy transition.

Rather than waiting for global SAF infrastructure to catch up, this agreement empowers businesses to take proactive steps now. It blends technological readiness with financial innovation, creating a practical pathway for industries to advance toward climate goals. And perhaps most importantly, it reframes emissions reduction as a shared responsibility—one that spans producers, buyers, investors, and society at large.

¦ Chris Rozansky is executive director of the Naples Airport Authority.","A quarter-century into the new millennium, and with Earth Day 2025 approaching, the Naples Airport Authority is ramping up our commitment to increased environmental responsibility and sustainability at the airport.

As an industry leader and community partner, we are passionate about being on the leading edge of aviation sustainability and environmental responsibility.

Our natural environment is an essential part of what makes Southwest Florida so special. We understand the importance of protecting our environment and continuously seek ways to reduce aviation’s local environmental impact.

To that end, we recently began offering UL94 unleaded fuel as an environmentally cleaner alternative to traditional 100LL avgas, and subsidizing the costs, enabling tenants such as our two flight schools to purchase this cleaner fuel. In Florida, just two other public airports offer this alternative. Nationwide, we are one of just 35 to offer UL94.

Also now available is a more sustainable alternative to jet fuel made in part from biomass rather than fossil fuels – think everything from wood pulp and algae to repurposed cooking oil. We project it to account for nearly 20% of the airport’s fuel sales in 2025.

Airport tenant NetJets, the world’s largest private jet operator, deserves credit for its participation. The commitments are significant: per the World Economic Forum, sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to cut aviation’s greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared with traditional jet fuels.

And as the first reliable sustainable aviation fuel supply point on the East Coast, Naples is playing a key role in making the fuel more accessible across the United States.

On the ground, the Naples Airport Authority is committed to taking steps to reduce its environmental impact, including replacing airport ground vehicles with zero-emission electric equipment and vehicles. The latest additions to our electric-powered ground fleet are Ford Lightning trucks and a variety of electric ground support equipment.

Protecting the environment for future generations is the goal, and we are committed to continually improving our sustainability practices.

Additionally, as part of our partnership with the Southwest Florida Land Preservation Trust, Naples Airport has placed large tracts of its land into permanent conservation for the Gordon River Greenway for residents to enjoy for generations to come.

As the work of the trust concludes, we will continue to preserve and maintain portions of the Gordon River Greenway on airport property. The maintenance of this property comes at no cost to city or county taxpayers.

Retention ponds along Airport Road accept runoff from the industrial park to the east, which covers more than 400 acres. In 2015, we modified the larger pond to create a filtering process, so the water leaves the airport in a nearly natural state. Those efforts drew industry recognition such as the Florida Airport Council’s J. Bryan Cooper Environmental Award.

In 2022, Naples Airport was recognized with the Federal Aviation Administration Southern Region Safety Award for its Comprehensive Wildlife Management Program. From enhancing runway drainage to proactive habitat management, this program focuses on protecting Southwest Florida’s native wildlife while ensuring the safety of our pilots and passengers.

Solar panels are being added to facility upgrades, contributing to cleaner energy use and furthering the airport’s sustainability goals.

With regard to noise reduction, we have added a new, free mobile app for residents to submit concerns, and continue to accept noise comments through the website www.flynaples.com/noise-comment and via the dedicated noise hotline at 239-326-9262. Residential noise monitors are also available for installation, by request.

These efforts demonstrate Naples Airport’s leadership in sustainable aviation and community commitment.

Results of soil, water quality and “black soot” investigations

In response to community concerns, the Naples Airport Authority has proactively conducted a series of tests over the years to monitor and confirm the quality of local soil, water and air.

The most recent round of testing, conducted in 2024, further reinforced the airport’s record of environmental safety and quality:

In air sampling conducted at seven locations, both on and off airport property, no detectable traces of lead were found. Additionally, 40 separate soil tests found that lead levels at the airport averaged 2.5 times less than those commonly found along Florida’s roadsides – and were over 800 times below the regulatory threshold for residential exposure.

Tests of airport groundwater samples found lead concentrations 16 times lower than the Environmental Protection Agency’s safe drinking water standards. Also, the Naples Airport Authority commissioned independent tests of what many residents have observed as “black soot” on four occasions between 2008 and 2023. Each test identified the material as pollen — particularly from palm trees native to the area — turned to mildew in our humid environment, rather than any petroleum-based material associated with aviation.

As aviation continues to progress in new and exciting directions, including the introduction of electric aircraft and sustainable aviation fuel, Naples Airport is committed to being an industry leader in environmentally sustainable and responsible technology and programs. ¦

Over the first 10 years of operation, ECO2FLY will avoid emissions of over 6.5 million tons of CO2

Madrid, 7 April 2025. Holcim, IGNIS P2X and Exolum have formed a strategic partnership to develop ECO2FLY, an innovative CO2 circular economy project that will transform industrial emissions – inherent in the cement production process – into sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF). These sustainable fuels can directly replace conventional kerosene made from fossil fuel with no need for adaptations in aircraft or supply infrastructure, facilitating the immediate decarbonization of air transportation.

The new facility, located at the Holcim factory in Villaluenga de la Sagra (Toledo), is designed to capture over 700,000 tons of CO2 annually during cement production. Part of this CO2 will be combined with green hydrogen produced from renewable energy to be converted into sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF), reaching an estimated production of 100,000 tons per year. The remaining CO2 will be stored permanently in geological repositories.

The combination of technology and production capacity for the fuel of the future of aviation positions ECO2FLY as a leader in Europe for the decarbonization of key development sectors considered difficult to decarbonize. In this context, Over the first 10 years of operation, ECO2FLY will avoid emissions of over 6.5 million tons of CO2.

Ricardo de Pablos, CEO of Holcim España, said,

This strategic alliance between IGNIS P2X and Exolum represents a decisive step forward as part of our commitment to the transformation and decarbonization of the industry.

“Not only are we making progress on reducing the carbon emissions of our own processes, but we are also driving a key innovation for construction in the form of cement with a total carbon reduction”.

In this regard, Ignacio Casajús, Global Strategy & Growth Lead at Exolum, highlighted how “Exolum is making a firm commitment to the development of partnerships that allow the development of sustainable fuels that, as of today, are presented as the only viable solution to reducing carbon emissions in the short term in sectors like aviation and shipping”.

José Antonio Membiela, CEO of IGNIS P2X, considers this project “the most important in the production of synthetic aviation fuel currently produced in Spain, both in terms of size and strategic location and the circularity it offers partners (energy, CO2 capture, methanol production and consumption in aviation). ECO2FLY combines the sustainability of a business of great important to the surrounding area, such as the cement industry, with the creation of new industry for decarbonization, which will generate employment and wealth for the region.

For his part, Javier Esteban, Director of the Consortium and Partner of P2X Spain, states that,

This project is an opportunity to be leaders in Europe in the production of eSAF, which represents an enormous strategic value for the Spanish economy.

“It will be the start of a new industry that will create employment and wealth, and a new energy paradigm for the country, with the opportunity to become exporters of renewable fuel on a large scale for the first time.”

Here at ECO2FLY, companies have come together from different sectors, all of them key for society like construction, energy, mobility, tourism and logistics. This partnership is an example of how inter-sectoral collaboration allows Europe to successfully tackle the challenges faced. This project will be submitted to the next call of the European Union Innovation Funds. Its roll-out will not only contribute to the energy transition and help achieve net zero emissions, but it will also drive the position of Spain and the European Union as a leader in industrial innovation and sustainability, strengthening our energy independence.

Without these credits, the economics of SAF supply is currently hard to justify amid the lack of obligation targets on the demand side.
We note that, looking beyond SAF and HVO, 45Z or general RFS policy uncertainty creates anxiety among project developers of nearly all other biofuel products.
The only exception is conventional corn-based ethanol supply with production following E10 domestic industry needs (i.e., following underlying gasoline demand).","Most US biofuel production numbers are clearly on track to end the first quarter of this year in negative territory either on a quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year basis, Rystad Energy analysis suggests. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published the updated statistics for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program on 20 March covering the supply, trade and price dynamics for February 2025. Similar to previous months, we still observe uncertainty around future biofuel policy starts having a tangible impact on the actual supply for nearly all bio products.

Production of US domestic renewable diesel – mainly hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) – declined sharply in January to around 167,000 bpd. Preliminary February 2025 data show it was even weaker at 130,000 bpd. We note that the final number can end up around 20% higher after the reporting is complete, but it is already quite clear that HVO supply is on track for a very significant drop in the first quarter of this year. A prolonged period of weak biomass-based diesel renewable identification number (D4 RIN) margins coupled with the persistent uncertainty around 45Z clean fuel tax credit rules under the new US administration have pushed HVO operators towards temporary shut-ins and reduced utilization rates of existing capacity.

When it comes to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) supply, last year this acted as a temporary solution as HVO operators were able to increase the share of SAF in the end-product mix to partially hedge against HVO oversupply. Some hope for SAF supply prospects was triggered by relatively robust January 2025 RIN generation numbers as some additional SAF deliveries from P66’s Rodeo Renewed facility in California pushed the three-month moving average SAF supply in the US up after a very weak fourth quarter of last year. Having said that, February 2025 supply numbers once again came in weak, with zero generation coming from foreign producers supplying the US market, such as Neste.

In the case of both SAF and HVO, continuous weakness in D4 RIN and low-carbon fuel standards (LCFS) prices accompanied by uncertainty surrounding 45Z tax credits after the expiration of the interim blender tax credit (BTC) does not allow project operators to understand their real revenue potential. The RFS and LCFS credit stack was providing around $1,000 per tonne of revenue support to SAF producers between the second half of 2022 and first half of 2023. This support has been down to less than $500 per tonne since that time. This dual-credit stack has never been sufficient on a standalone basis to offset the price differential between SAF and traditional jet fuel (JetA) on a delivered price basis – which is one of the main reasons behind limited SAF supply in the US prior to 2023. When 45Z and interim BTC came into the picture in 2023, SAF supply experienced a boom. With the proposed 45Z guidelines, SAF project developers should be eligible for between $400 and $570 per tonne of 45Z credit amount depending on the lifecycle emission intensity of the production pathway. Without these credits, the economics of SAF supply is currently hard to justify amid the lack of obligation targets on the demand side. If 45Z rules are finalized, we expect robust short-term economics for SAF producers with the lowest carbon intensity (CI) score and gradual upward pressure on SAF prices to eliminate arbitrate opportunities.

We note that, looking beyond SAF and HVO, 45Z or general RFS policy uncertainty creates anxiety among project developers of nearly all other biofuel products. The only exception is conventional corn-based ethanol supply with production following E10 domestic industry needs (i.e., following underlying gasoline demand). Biodiesel imports are already down by around 40% on a 12-month average basis since August 2024 as European volumes are redirected to the domestic market and an ongoing tariff war creates significant uncertainty for Canadian volumes. We note that imports have not yet been replaced by increased domestic production, with the US fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) supply being weak in this year’s first quarter amid the same 45Z uncertainty.

Renewable natural gas (RNG) and cellulosic ethanol are among the very few bioenergy products in the US that continue to grow, but significant uncertainty around the D3 cellulosic waiver credit for 2024 (which remains unfinalized) as well as D3 obligation targets for 2026 under governance of EPA administrator Lee Zeldin have already delayed a number of new investment decisions in the sector.

Dr. Iboyi is currently based in the United States.
He earned his Master’s in Agronomy from the University of Ibadan, Nigeria, followed by a PhD in Agronomy from the University of Florida, United States.","Nigerian scientist and member of the American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Dr. Joseph Iboyi, has identified the the need to utilise biomass-based sustainable aviation fuel to help achieve sustainable, carbon-neutral growth for the aviation sector.

In a statement he made available to PUNCH Online on Wednesday, Dr. Iboyi said the non-food biofuel crop called carinata, is one of the leading biomass feedstocks that can help reduce the carbon footprint of several countries’ aviation sectors, and was recently introduced to the Southeastern United States to assess its suitability for growing during the winter and incorporate it into existing rotations in the region.

He said biomass feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel is an area of active research globally, including the United States, pointing out that he has pioneered groundbreaking research focused on developing agronomic management practices to establish carinata into existing cropping systems in the Southeastern United States.

His pioneering work has led to the development of seeding rate, tillage, and fertilizer recommendations that farmers in the Southeastern United States are now using to grow carinata successfully during the winter.

Dr. Iboyi also conducted the first comprehensive research investigating the possibility of double-cropping carinata with summer-planted crops, including cotton, soybean, peanut, and sorghum, as part of diversified crop rotations in the Southeastern United States.

His findings revealed that carinata can successfully replace winter fallow, and can be double-cropped with summer-planted summer crops (typically cotton, peanut, soybean, and sorghum) with no adverse effect on yield.

The significance of Dr. Iboyi’s research to farmers in the United States cannot be overstated, since farmers are generally known to explore ways to generate new revenue streams. His research which focused on helping farmers achieve this goal, highlighted the opportunity for row crop growers in the Southeastern United States to increase profitability by double-cropping between summer crops instead of leaving winter fallow land vulnerable to weeds, nutrient leaching, and runoff.

According to him, double-cropping carinata between summer crops not only has the potential to generate extra offseason income for growers and downstream processors in the United States but may also contribute to increased land-use efficiency, annual net primary production, and soil carbon sequestration.

This research holds particular relevance in regions such as Africa, where resource constraints often limit farmers’ ability to optimize their agricultural inputs.

By developing tangible field-based agronomic and practical solutions to farmer problems, Dr. Iboyi’s work offers actionable insights for improving agronomic management practices, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

Dr. Iboyi is currently based in the United States. He earned his Master’s in Agronomy from the University of Ibadan, Nigeria, followed by a PhD in Agronomy from the University of Florida, United States. Currently engaged in agronomic research on carinata, corn, peanuts, soybeans, and cotton, Dr. Iboyi’s expertise has positioned him at the forefront of significant agricultural innovations.

His contributions are helping to address critical challenges in modern crop management. His achievements exemplify the potential of interdisciplinary thinking and global collaboration in addressing pressing agricultural challenges.

His dedication serves as an inspiration to the next generation of scientists, demonstrating how innovative research can drive meaningful contributions to sustainable agriculture and global food security.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/09180552/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-09-at-14.46.07_1f9accc7-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 14:57:50.342288

Erkki Liikanen, Chair of the IFRS Foundation Trustees, said:

“We are delighted to be formalising our partnership with TNFD to ensure that the ISSB gives due consideration to the work TNFD have put into creating recommendations for nature-related financial disclosures.”

The TNFD was launched in 2021, building on the success of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), to support organizations in reporting and acting on their nature-related risks. The organization published its final recommendations for nature-related risk management and disclosure in September 2023, centered around 14 recommended disclosures, aimed at helping inform better decision-making by companies and capital providers on nature and biodiversity-related risks, opportunities, dependencies and impacts. The organization recently reported that more than 1,700 organizations have joined as members of the TNFD Forum, its network of aligned institutions, and more than 520 companies and financial institutions have committed to begin nature-related corporate reporting, based on the TNFD recommendations.

The IFRS Foundation’s International Sustainability Standards Board was launched in November 2021, with the goal to develop IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards to provide investors with information about companies’ sustainability risks and opportunities. The IFRS released the inaugural general sustainability (IFRS S1) and climate (IFRS S2) reporting standards in June 2023.

As part of its 2024 – 2026 work plan following the release of its initial standards, the ISSB is researching risks and opportunities associated with sustainability topics beyond climate, including exploring information about sustainability-related risks and opportunities associated with biodiversity, ecosystems and ecosystem services (BEES), and deciding whether to pursue standard-setting for disclosure requirements on these topics.

Under the new agreement, the organizations said that the ISSB and TNFD will share research, knowledge and technical expertise to inform the ISSB’s BEES initiative, as well as the nature-related aspects of its industry-focused SASB standards enhancement work. The ISSB and TNFD also said that they will further explore joint market engagement and capacity-building initiatives, including with other key partner organizations.

TNFD Co-Chair Razan Al-Mubarak said:

“Nature is essential to our economies and our future. Our collaboration with the ISSB is a major step toward making nature visible in businesses reporting and how capital is allocated. Climate-related standards have already moved markets, and we are pleased to continue to support ISSB efforts that bring the rest of nature into global reporting practice.”

The formalized agreement follows a long-time collaboration between the organizations, with the ISSB serving as a TNFD Knowledge Partner since the inception of the TNFD, and the TNFD already working to support the ISSB’s BEES project. The organizations said that the new agreement will deepen their collaboration as the ISSB considers the TNFD recommendations in its research into the needs of global capital markets for information about nature-related risks and opportunities.

Sue Lloyd, ISSB Vice-Chair, said:

“Our collaboration with the TNFD is a clear signal to the market that we are committed to reducing fragmentation in sustainability disclosure while meeting the need for relevant and high-quality information for capital markets.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IFRS2.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 13:57:14.928220

As airlines and regulators aim for carbon neutrality, SAF has emerged as a critical component for reducing aviation-related emissions. However, while the science and sustainability of SAF have advanced, the political and economic landscape has not always been supportive. One significant disruptor was the era of U.S. protectionism under the Trump administration, where sweeping tariffs altered the dynamics of global trade. In this blog, we analyze how Trump-era trade policies affected the sustainable aviation fuel market—shaping innovation, supply chains, and competitive positioning across the globe.

Trump Tariffs and the SAF Market: A Direct Economic Collision

The Trump administration's tariff campaigns, particularly against China and the European Union, were intended to revive domestic manufacturing and address trade imbalances. However, these actions inadvertently affected the aviation fuel sector. SAF production often relies on international collaboration for feedstocks, technologies, and processing equipment. Imposing tariffs on raw materials like soybean oil, waste oils, and even refinery technology meant higher production costs and longer timelines. U.S. companies producing or researching SAF faced challenges sourcing affordable inputs and components, leading to delayed investments and slower scaling.

The SAF market, while still emerging, requires delicate policy handling due to its reliance on cross-border resources and partnerships. Tariffs disrupted these interdependencies, making it difficult for startups and innovators to operate efficiently. Some producers turned inward, attempting to localize their supply chains—a process that increased capital expenditure and operational risk.

Winners and Losers of the Trade War: SAF’s Uneven Playing Field

During the trade war, certain SAF producers—particularly those heavily reliant on imports—struggled with cost increases and regulatory confusion. Conversely, firms that had vertically integrated domestic supply chains benefited in the short term. U.S. biofuel refiners that sourced locally found temporary pricing advantages as imported alternatives became less competitive due to tariffs.

However, the long-term impact was more nuanced. While protectionist measures may have offered domestic SAF producers a short-lived edge, they also restricted access to superior international technologies and partnerships. Moreover, retaliatory tariffs from affected countries made it harder for U.S. SAF firms to export or license their solutions abroad, shrinking market opportunities.

Can the U.S. Lead the SAF Market After Trump’s Trade War?

Despite setbacks, the U.S. remains a contender in the global SAF race. The question is whether it can lead. Post-tariff, there's been a concerted effort to boost domestic SAF production through new federal incentives, such as the Inflation Reduction Act's biofuel tax credits. However, leadership in this market goes beyond production volume. It demands technological innovation, resilient supply chains, and international cooperation.

The Trump-era tariffs encouraged U.S. companies to localize, which could pay dividends if domestic feedstock supply becomes more stable. Still, the SAF market is global by necessity. Sustainable feedstocks like used cooking oil or agricultural waste are geographically dispersed. Therefore, international trade must remain a core pillar of SAF strategy. If the U.S. hopes to lead, it must harmonize domestic strength with global openness.

Economic Fallout of Tariffs on SAF Growth and Investment

The uncertainty triggered by the trade war caused a measurable dip in SAF-related investments. Companies were reluctant to commit capital amid fears of unstable input costs and unclear regulatory trajectories. Venture funding into green aviation projects slowed between 2018 and 2020, reflecting broader investor caution in the face of policy unpredictability.

In addition to deterring private capital, tariffs strained public-private partnerships. State and federal agencies, uncertain about international cooperation or material costs, postponed or scaled back green aviation initiatives. The broader economic impact was a deceleration in SAF R&D and pilot projects, delaying the industry’s ability to scale production affordably.

SAF Supply Chains Under Siege: A Case of Protectionism Backfiring

One of the most profound impacts of Trump’s tariffs was on the SAF supply chain. While the intent was to reduce reliance on foreign goods, the immediate outcome was increased friction in acquiring key feedstocks and technologies. For example, many U.S.-based SAF developers depended on imported feedstocks such as palm fatty acid distillates and tallow from Asia or Latin America. Tariffs made these imports prohibitively expensive or logistically complex.

Supply chain delays rippled across the SAF ecosystem, affecting fuel certification timelines, blending logistics, and end-user pricing. Airlines, facing costlier fuel alternatives, reduced their demand for SAF, opting to delay sustainability goals. This circular impact—from tariffs to supply chains to demand—illustrates how trade policy and clean energy development are intricately linked.

Did Trump Tariffs Delay SAF Adoption in Commercial Aviation?

Commercial aviation’s adoption of SAF is driven by a mix of regulatory pressure, corporate sustainability goals, and economic feasibility. During the Trump era, tariffs increased costs for SAF producers, which were passed on to airlines in the form of higher prices. As a result, carriers that had pledged to increase SAF usage slowed their timelines or limited adoption to pilot programs.

Additionally, the policy uncertainty made airlines cautious about long-term procurement contracts. Without predictable SAF pricing, airlines couldn’t forecast operating costs accurately. In effect, the trade war created a psychological and economic barrier to SAF adoption in one of its most important customer segments.

The Global SAF Outlook: Bouncing Back from Trade Shocks

Today, the SAF market is in recovery mode. Global demand is resurging as governments, particularly in Europe and Asia, push for net-zero aviation emissions. The U.S., too, is refocusing on green fuel initiatives under new leadership. Investment is flowing back into SAF technologies, and supply chains are being reconfigured to prioritize resilience over mere cost-efficiency.

Lessons from the Trump-era tariffs are shaping current strategy. Many SAF companies now hedge against geopolitical risks by diversifying their sourcing regions and investing in modular, mobile production units. Moreover, the global SAF market is increasingly looking toward bilateral agreements that guarantee feedstock flow and avoid tariff entanglements.

U.S. vs. EU: Diverging Policy Paths and Global SAF Leadership

The Trump tariffs starkly contrasted with the European Union’s approach to sustainable aviation. While the U.S. embraced protectionism, the EU doubled down on green energy subsidies and cross-border collaboration. As a result, European SAF developers gained momentum, attracting international investors and building scalable supply chains.

Now, the U.S. is attempting to catch up through legislative incentives and industrial policy reforms. However, regaining global leadership requires more than money. The SAF market thrives on interoperability, certification alignment, and technological standardization. Rebuilding international trust and trade bridges—damaged during the trade war—is essential for American SAF firms to compete globally.

Long-Term Impact on SAF Innovation and Commercialization

The trade war's chilling effect on innovation may not be fully reversed for years. Startups that failed to secure funding or had projects delayed during the tariff period lost valuable time in a fast-evolving market. Some companies pivoted away from aviation fuels altogether, weakening the innovation pipeline.

However, adversity also breeds resilience. Some firms emerged stronger, having developed proprietary feedstock processing technologies or secured domestic feedstock partnerships. These innovations are now feeding back into a leaner, more agile SAF ecosystem. Still, the pace of SAF commercialization would have been faster without the policy roadblocks introduced during the Trump years.

Trade Policy Must Support Green Innovation

The sustainable aviation fuel market is a cornerstone of aviation’s climate future. Yet its growth is deeply intertwined with global trade flows, technology partnerships, and cross-border investment. The Trump-era tariffs, while aimed at economic revival, imposed unintended burdens on SAF producers, airlines, and investors. As the world accelerates its energy transition, this episode serves as a reminder: trade policy must be aligned with climate policy.

In 5–10 years, we expect XCF to be a global leader in Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Mihir Dange, CEO

By Prakash Jha

April 8, 2025

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is rapidly emerging as one of the most viable low-carbon solutions for the aviation industry, offering a pathway to significantly reduce the sector’s greenhouse gas emissions. With growing regulatory support, increased corporate demand, and airlines’ commitments to achieve net-zero emissions, SAF is gaining attention. The market for SAF is expected to grow substantially in the coming years as it addresses the aviation industry’s critical need for sustainable, scalable alternatives to traditional jet fuel.

In an exclusive interview with our Editor Prakash Jha, Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global, shed light on how his company is positioned to take advantage of this market boom. Dange discussed XCF Global’s unique role as a dedicated SAF producer, its operational advantages, and the strategic initiatives the company is undertaking to meet the growing demand. As XCF Global prepares for its upcoming NASDAQ debut, Dange highlighted the company’s commitment to sustainable growth and its vision for the future of aviation fuel.

Q. The market for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is projected to experience substantial growth. What makes this market so attractive to institutional investors, and how does XCF Global plan to capitalize on this growth?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents one of the most commercially viable low-carbon solutions for aviation in the global energy transition. Investors are increasingly seeking assets that combine strong fundamentals with measurable ESG impact. The SAF market does exactly that. It is backed by regulatory momentum, growing corporate demand, and decarbonization mandates from governments and airlines around the world.

At XCF Global, we offer early access to SAF as a dedicated, pure-play producer. Our New Rise Reno production facility is operational and has an expected annual production capacity of 38 million gallons of neat SAF. We have a long-term agreement in place with Phillips 66 to provide non-food feedstock and offtake of renewable fuels, providing cash flow visibility and stability. XCF’s early-mover advantage and rapid scalability are compelling.

Q. What do you believe are the key factors driving the increasing demand for SAF, and how can investors ensure that they are getting the best return on their investments in this space?

Several converging forces are driving SAF demand: airline net-zero commitments, regional SAF blending mandates (especially in Europe), the rise of corporate ESG targets, and, most notably, the aviation industry’s lack of viable alternatives to liquid fuels. SAF is no longer an idea for decarbonizing the aviation industry – it’s the solution.

We believe stakeholders need to look at producers with real offtake agreements, proven production capacity, and scalable infrastructure. XCF is already delivering SAF. Our ability to monetize carbon credits, the opportunity to secure advantageous pricing in international markets, and deploy capital efficiently gives us a financial and operational edge in this space.

Q. XCF Global is set for its NASDAQ debut. How do you envision this public listing benefiting the company in both the short and long term?

Our NASDAQ listing is a milestone that positions us for scale, visibility, and access to growth capital. In the short term, it allows us to broaden our shareholder base, attract institutional coverage, and deepen investor engagement. It also enhances credibility with customers, regulators, and trade partners.

Long term, being a Nasdaq listed company provides us with a platform to expand our production footprint, explore new technologies, and solidify our position as a leading pure-play SAF company globally. We’re committed to delivering sustainable returns to shareholders – financially and environmentally.

Q. As the only public pure-play SAF producer in the U.S., what specific advantages does XCF Global have over competitors in this rapidly growing sector?

We are operational today with expected annual production capacity of 38 million gallons of neat SAF output from our New Rise Reno production facility. That head start matters – especially in a market where demand vastly outpaces supply and bringing new facilities online is challenging.

We also benefit from:

•

Project pipeline: Our Reno, Nevada facility and an adjacent plot for SAF facility development is strategically located within proximity to SFO, LAX, and other west coast airports. This second facility in Reno is expected to come online in 2027. Additional plants in Florida and North Carolina are expected to service the Southeast and East Coast regions of the US and provide convenient access to deepwater ports that facilitate export. The Florida and North Carolina facilities are expected to come online in 2028 after which XCF expects to have the ability to produce 159 million gallons of annualized neat SAF production.

•

Feedstock flexibility: Our pre-treatment process allows for multiple non-food feedstock inputs, improving stability and reducing CI scores.

•

Fortune 50 partnerships: Partnership with Phillips 66 validates our model and provide supply chain stability.

•

Scalability: New Rise Reno has a pending utility patent related to the design, layout and configuration of its production facility. This site design requires less area to build a production facility and can be efficiently replicated as modular design allows for rapid expansion.

Q. Many clean energy companies have gone public in recent years. How does XCF Global’s strategy differ from other clean energy plays, and what sets you apart in the market?

Many clean energy IPOs have focused on long-term R&D or future-forward concepts. XCF is different—we’re built to deliver. We have an operating SAF facility, a long-term supply and off-take agreement with a Fortune 50 Company, and are generating revenue. Our unit economics work because we’ve designed our business around flexible feedstocks and offtake certainty.

Q. Airline net-zero commitments are driving the adoption of SAF. How quickly do you see the airline industry transitioning to SAF, and what role do you believe XCF Global will play in this transition?

Several major airlines around the world have committed to achieving 10% SAF usage by 2030. The transition is accelerating as carbon reduction becomes a competitive and regulatory imperative. However, the biggest bottleneck is supply—and that’s where XCF comes in.

We’re one of the few producers prepared to meet this demand. Our role is to bridge the supply gap, de-risk procurement for airlines, and provide low-CI SAF that helps them meet their sustainability goals. We’re not just a supplier—we’re a strategic partner in their net-zero journey.

Q. What challenges do airlines face in terms of SAF supply, and how is XCF Global positioned to help bridge that gap?

Airlines face three primary challenges: availability, cost, and carbon intensity. Many facilities won’t be online until the end of the decade, leaving a multi-year supply shortage. Pricing remains volatile, and not all SAF is created equal—many options still have high CI scores.

XCF addresses all three:

•

Availability: Our flagship facility, New Rise Reno, is online today with expected annual production capacity of 38 million gallons of neat SAF

•

Cost: Our ability to diversify feedstock types allows us to effectively manage input costs.

•

Carbon impact: Our fuel helps customers earn value in carbon markets.

Q. Can you provide insights into the company’s strategic expansion plans in Nevada, Florida, and North Carolina? How do these regions align with the company’s broader vision for growth?

Our site strategy is designed for scale and resilience. Reno, Nevada is our first operational site, providing immediate production and proximity to West Coast aviation hubs.

XCF is developing an additional site, New Rise Reno 2, located directly adjacent to New Rise. This site will leverage existing infrastructure at New Rise, including pretreatment, electrical, water, and logistics, eliminating the need for a full ground-up build.

The site in Florida will expand our reach into Southeastern markets, while the site in North Carolina will serve as an East Coast conduit.

These locations facilitate logistics, permitting ease, feedstock availability, and access to major transportation corridors. Our patent-pending, 10-acre design allows us to replicate production quickly, enabling a modular path to bringing our projects to life.

Q. There is a significant gap between SAF supply and demand. What specific steps is XCF Global taking to ensure it can meet the surging demand for SAF over the next few years?

We’ve taken a proactive approach to close that gap:

1.

Near-term production: New Rise Reno is already operational. A second facility adjacent to New Rise is projected to come online in 2027 with the Florida and North Carolina facilities expected to commence operations in 2028.

2.

Replicable design: Our patent-pending facility design enables rapid deployment at future sites across the U.S. and globally.

3.

Strong partnerships: Our agreement with Phillips 66 ensures stable feedstock and off-take, enhancing predictability and stability for our trade partners.

Q. As one of the first movers in the SAF space, where do you see XCF Global in the next 5–10 years? How will you maintain your competitive edge as the industry evolves?

In 5–10 years, we expect XCF to be a global leader in SAF, recognized for delivering clean, reliable, low-carbon fuel solutions in aviation. We plan to be operating multiple facilities in the U.S. and beyond, supplying major airlines and energy companies, and leveraging our platform to drive decarbonization across aviation and beyond.

Ultimately, our success will be defined not just by gallons produced – but by our leadership in decarbonizing the air travel.

SAF is no longer an idea for decarbonizing the aviation industry – it’s the solution.

We believe stakeholders need to look at producers with real offtake agreements, proven production capacity, and scalable infrastructure. XCF is already delivering SAF. Our ability to monetize carbon credits, the opportunity to secure advantageous pricing in international markets, and deploy capital efficiently gives us a financial and operational edge in this space.

Q. XCF Global is set for its NASDAQ debut. How do you envision this public listing benefiting the company in both the short and long term?

Our NASDAQ listing is a milestone that positions us for scale, visibility, and access to growth capital. In the short term, it allows us to broaden our shareholder base, attract institutional coverage, and deepen investor engagement. It also enhances credibility with customers, regulators, and trade partners.

Long term, being a Nasdaq listed company provides us with a platform to expand our production footprint, explore new technologies, and solidify our position as a leading pure-play SAF company globally. We’re committed to delivering sustainable returns to shareholders – financially and environmentally.

Q. As the only public pure-play SAF producer in the U.S., what specific advantages does XCF Global have over competitors in this rapidly growing sector?

We are operational today with expected annual production capacity of 38 million gallons of neat SAF output from our New Rise Reno production facility. That head start matters – especially in a market where demand vastly outpaces supply and bringing new facilities online is challenging.

We also benefit from:

•

Project pipeline: Our Reno, Nevada facility and an adjacent plot for SAF facility development is strategically located within proximity to SFO, LAX, and other west coast airports. This second facility in Reno is expected to come online in 2027. Additional plants in Florida and North Carolina are expected to service the Southeast and East Coast regions of the US and provide convenient access to deepwater ports that facilitate export. The Florida and North Carolina facilities are expected to come online in 2028 after which XCF expects to have the ability to produce 159 million gallons of annualized neat SAF production.

•

Feedstock flexibility: Our pre-treatment process allows for multiple non-food feedstock inputs, improving stability and reducing CI scores.

•

Fortune 50 partnerships: Partnership with Phillips 66 validates our model and provide supply chain stability.

•

Scalability: New Rise Reno has a pending utility patent related to the design, layout and configuration of its production facility. This site design requires less area to build a production facility and can be efficiently replicated as modular design allows for rapid expansion.

Q. Many clean energy companies have gone public in recent years. How does XCF Global’s strategy differ from other clean energy plays, and what sets you apart in the market?

Many clean energy IPOs have focused on long-term R&D or future-forward concepts. XCF is different—we’re built to deliver. We have an operating SAF facility, a long-term supply and off-take agreement with a Fortune 50 Company, and are generating revenue. Our unit economics work because we’ve designed our business around flexible feedstocks and offtake certainty.

Q. Airline net-zero commitments are driving the adoption of SAF. How quickly do you see the airline industry transitioning to SAF, and what role do you believe XCF Global will play in this transition?

Several major airlines around the world have committed to achieving 10% SAF usage by 2030. The transition is accelerating as carbon reduction becomes a competitive and regulatory imperative. However, the biggest bottleneck is supply—and that’s where XCF comes in.

We’re one of the few producers prepared to meet this demand. Our role is to bridge the supply gap, de-risk procurement for airlines, and provide low-CI SAF that helps them meet their sustainability goals. We’re not just a supplier—we’re a strategic partner in their net-zero journey.

Q. What challenges do airlines face in terms of SAF supply, and how is XCF Global positioned to help bridge that gap?

Airlines face three primary challenges: availability, cost, and carbon intensity. Many facilities won’t be online until the end of the decade, leaving a multi-year supply shortage. Pricing remains volatile, and not all SAF is created equal—many options still have high CI scores.

XCF addresses all three:

•

Availability: Our flagship facility, New Rise Reno, is online today with expected annual production capacity of 38 million gallons of neat SAF

•

Cost: Our ability to diversify feedstock types allows us to effectively manage input costs.

•

Carbon impact: Our fuel helps customers earn value in carbon markets.

Q. Can you provide insights into the company’s strategic expansion plans in Nevada, Florida, and North Carolina? How do these regions align with the company’s broader vision for growth?

Our site strategy is designed for scale and resilience. Reno, Nevada is our first operational site, providing immediate production and proximity to West Coast aviation hubs.

XCF is developing an additional site, New Rise Reno 2, located directly adjacent to New Rise. This site will leverage existing infrastructure at New Rise, including pretreatment, electrical, water, and logistics, eliminating the need for a full ground-up build.

The site in Florida will expand our reach into Southeastern markets, while the site in North Carolina will serve as an East Coast conduit.

These locations facilitate logistics, permitting ease, feedstock availability, and access to major transportation corridors. Our patent-pending, 10-acre design allows us to replicate production quickly, enabling a modular path to bringing our projects to life.

Q. There is a significant gap between SAF supply and demand. What specific steps is XCF Global taking to ensure it can meet the surging demand for SAF over the next few years?

We’ve taken a proactive approach to close that gap:

1.

Near-term production: New Rise Reno is already operational. A second facility adjacent to New Rise is projected to come online in 2027 with the Florida and North Carolina facilities expected to commence operations in 2028.

2.

Replicable design: Our patent-pending facility design enables rapid deployment at future sites across the U.S. and globally.

3.

Strong partnerships: Our agreement with Phillips 66 ensures stable feedstock and off-take, enhancing predictability and stability for our trade partners.

Q. As one of the first movers in the SAF space, where do you see XCF Global in the next 5–10 years? How will you maintain your competitive edge as the industry evolves?

In 5–10 years, we expect XCF to be a global leader in SAF, recognized for delivering clean, reliable, low-carbon fuel solutions in aviation. We plan to be operating multiple facilities in the U.S. and beyond, supplying major airlines and energy companies, and leveraging our platform to drive decarbonization across aviation and beyond.

Ultimately, our success will be defined not just by gallons produced – but by our leadership in decarbonizing the air travel.

INTERVIEW: Small US SAF plants well-positioned for investment amid turbulence, XCF CFO

By Thomas Washington and Jeff Mower

Modular approach offers cheaper finance alternatives

RINs market recovering after slump

US RD projects have faced bankruptcy, presenting SAF opportunities

Sustainable aviation fuel could see turbo-charged demand growth in the years to come, but with volatile prices and political headwinds in the US, investment in the near term will likely be limited, according to the chief financial officer of SAF producer XCF Global.

Larger facilities often require substantial upfront capital and are heavily reliant on long-term offtake agreements, which can be challenging to secure in the current market, XCF's Simon Oxley told Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, in an April 4 interview. The absence of established market norms and the lack of long-term contracts with airlines, which typically have weak balance sheets, create significant risk for investors, he added

By contrast, small modular projects are more attractive to financing because they require lower initial investments, can be developed incrementally and are more agile in response to market conditions, Oxley said.

""The airline industry is not slowing down, demand for planes is not slowing down,"" he said. ""So what we want to be able to do is sort of fill that gap and that gap does exist.""

XCF intends to be a leading producer of SAF in North America. It recently completed its acquisition of New Rise Renewables, which can produce 38 million gal/year of SAF, or just over 3,300 b/d of neat or unblended SAF, at its unit in Reno, Nevada. In the US, SAF is blended with petroleum-based jet fuel at a blending ratio of 10% to 50%. XCF is expected to become a publicly listed company on Nasdaq, it has said.

XCF plans to have neat SAF production capacity of more than 150 million gallons, or just over 13,000 b/d over the next five years, the company said in March 2024. To that end, XCF has acquired two locations -- one in Wilson, North Carolina, and Fort Myers, Florida. Total blended SAF production capacity could reach 1 billion gallons/year, the company said. XCF uses distilled corn oil, a waste product, as feedstock.

Volatile pricing environment

Part of US President Donald Trump's election platform was hostility to the climate-friendly policies of his predecessor Joe Biden.

This weighed heavily on renewable identification numbers. D4 RIN prices slumped from 91.25 cents/RIN Jan. 20, when Trump took office, to 74.5 cents/RIN March 13. However, they have since firmed; Platts assessed them at 104.25 cents/RIN April 4.

Much of the investment in facilities created by Biden's Inflation Reduction Act was in red states, such as Georgia and Texas, and members of Congress from those states have pushed back against plans to undermine biofuel plants in their constituencies. As such, ethanol earmarked for transport fuels looks safe for now, Oxley said.

""In order for them to change the tax rules, they need a change in law and they would need 100% Republican support in order to be able to push it through,"" he said.

SAF has strong growth prospects and has no substitution risk, unlike renewable diesel, which has seen a number of projects face bankruptcy, Oxley said.

Converting renewable diesel plants to SAF output, a similar product, in relatively short order, becomes ""quite an interesting way"" to participate in the SAF market, he said.

There are a lot of renewable diesel facilities that have gone through bankruptcy, been restructured and have a lot of counterparties who are holding equity but do not want to, Oxley said.

XCF's Reno facility was previously a renewable diesel facility.

The uncertainty that is being created by the Trump administration's decarbonization-averse policies, not least in relation to the large, IRA-related loans, means that the larger projects struggle to attract finance, Oxley said.

""They're too big; they're not in the sweet spot, whereas our approach is more modular,"" he said. The important difference is going to be XCF's ability to issue equity, bring new parties onboard, with new businesses onto the platform, and grow in an expedited basis that way, he added.

Some forecasts predict growth continued growth in renewable diesel. Renewable diesel demand in the US will rise to 39.277 million mt in 2050 from 11.785 million mt in 2025, according to data from analysts at S&P Global Commodity Insights. US SAF demand will grow to 32.325 million mt in 2050 from 2.118 million mt in 2025, the analysts said.

And in this massive undertaking, no airplane maker is as invested as Airbus.

At the Airbus Summit, a symposium for journalists on 24 and 25 March, top executives sketched out a bold, tech-forward vision for the company’s next couple of generations of aircraft. The highlight, from a tech perspective, is a superconducting, fuel-cell powered airliner.

Airbus’s strategy is based on parallel development efforts. While undertaking the enormous R&D projects needed to create the large, fuel-cell aircraft, the company said it will also work aggressively on an airliner designed to wring the most possible efficiency out of combustion-based propulsion. For this plane, the company is targeting a 20-to-30 percent reduction in fuel consumption, according to Bruno Fichefeux, head of future programmes at Airbus. The plane would be a single-aisle airliner, designed to succeed Airbus’s A320 family of aircraft, the highest-selling passenger jet aircraft on the market, with nearly 12,000 delivered. The company expects the new plane to enter service some time in the latter half of the 2030s.

Airbus hopes to achieve such a large efficiency gain by exploiting emerging advances in jet engines, wings, lightweight, high-strength composite materials, and sustainable aviation fuel. For example, Airbus disclosed that it is now working on a pair of advanced jet engines, the more radical of which would have an open fan whose blades would spin without a surrounding nacelle. Airbus is evaluating such an engine in a project with partner CFM International, a joint venture between GE Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines.

Without a nacelle to enclose them, an engine’s fan blades can be very large, permitting higher levels of “bypass air,” which is the air sucked in to the back of the engine—separate from the air used to combust fuel—and expelled to provide thrust. The ratio of bypass air to combustion air is an important measure of engine performance, with higher ratios indicating higher efficiencies, according to Mohamed Ali, chief technology and operating officer for GE Aerospace. Typical bypass ratios today are around 11 or 12, but the open-fan design could enable ratios as high as 60, according to Ali.

The partners have already tested open-fan engines in two different series of wind-tunnel tests in Europe, Ali added. “The results have been extremely encouraging, not only because they are really good in terms of performance and noise validation, but also [because] they’re validating the computational analysis that we have done,” Ali said at the Airbus event.

A scale model of an open-fan aircraft engine was tested last year in a wind tunnel in Modane, France. The tests were conducted by France’s national aerospace research agency and Safran Aircraft Engines, which is working on open-fan engines with GE Aerospace.Safran Aircraft Engines

Fuel-cell airliner is a cornerstone of zero-emission goals

In parallel with this advanced combustion-powered airliner, Airbus has been developing a fuel-cell aircraft for five years under a program called ZEROe. At the Summit, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury backed off of a goal to fly such a plane by 2035, citing the lack of a regulatory framework for certifying such an aircraft as well as the slow pace of the build-out of infrastructure needed to produce “green” hydrogen at commercial scale and at competitive prices. “We would have the risk of a sort of ‘Concord of hydrogen’ where we would have a solution, but that would not be a commercially viable solution at scale,” Faury explained.

That said, he took pains to reaffirm the company’s commitment to the project. “We continue to believe in hydrogen,” he declared. “We’re absolutely convinced that this is an energy for the future for aviation, but there’s just more work to be done. More work for Airbus, and more work for the others around us to bring that energy to something that is at scale, that is competitive, and that will lead to a success, making a significant contribution to decarbonization.” Many of the world’s major industries, including aviation, have pledged to achieve zero net greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050, a fact that Faury and other Airbus officials repeatedly invoked as a key driver of the ZEROe project.

Later in the event, Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus’s vice president in charge of the ZEROe program, described the project in detail, indicating an effort of breathtaking technological ambition. The envisioned aircraft would seat at least 100 people and have a range of 1000 nautical miles (1850 kilometers). It would be powered by four fuel-cell “engines” (two on each wing), each with a power output of 2 megawatts.

According to Hauke Luedders, head of fuel cell propulsion systems development at Airbus, the company has already done extensive tests in Munich on a 1.2 MW system built with partners including Liebherr Group, ElringKlinger, Magna Steyr, and Diehl. Luedders said the company is focusing on low-temperature proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells, although it has not yet settled on the technology.

But the real stunner was Llewellyn’s description of a comprehensive program at Airbus to design and test a complete superconducting electrical powertrain for the fuel-cell aircraft. “As the hydrogen stored on the aircraft is stored at a very cold temperature, minus 253 degrees Celsius, we can use this temperature and the cryogenic technology to also efficiently cool down the electrics in the full system,” Llewellyn explained. “It significantly improves the energy efficiency and the performance. And even if this is an early technology, with the right efforts and the right partnerships, this could be a game changer for our fuel-cell aircraft, for our fully electric aircraft, enabling us to design larger, more powerful, and more efficient aircraft.”

In response to a question from IEEE Spectrum, Llewellyn elaborated that all of the major components of the electric propulsion system would be cryo-cooled: “electric distribution system, electronic controls, power converters, and the motors”—specifically, the coils in the motors. “We’re working with partners on every single component,” he added. The cryo-cooling system would chill a refrigerant that would circulate to keep the components cold, he explained.

A fuel cell aircraft “engine,” as envisioned by Airbus, would include a 2-megawatt electric motor and associated motor control unit (MCU), a fuel-cell system to power the motor, and associated systems for supplying air, hydrogen fuel, liquid refrigerant, and other necessities. The ram air system would capture cold air flowing over the aircraft for use in the cooling systems.Airbus SAS

Could aviation be the killer app for superconductors?

Llewellyn did not specify which superconductors and refrigerants the team was working with. But high temperature superconductors are a good bet, because of the drastically reduced requirements on the cooling system that would be needed to sustain superconductivity.

Copper-oxide based ceramic superconductors were invented at IBM in 1986, and various forms of them can superconduct at temperatures between –238 °C (35 K) and –140 °C (133 K) at ambient pressure. These temperatures are higher than traditional superconductors, which need temperatures below about 25 K. Nevertheless, commercial applications for the high-temperature superconductors have been elusive.

But a superconductivity expert, applied physicist Yu He at Yale University, was heartened by the news from Airbus. “My first reaction was, ‘really?’ And my second reaction was, wow, this whole line of research, or application, is indeed growing and I’m very delighted” about Airbus’s ambitious plans.

Copper-oxide superconductors have been used in a few applications, almost all of them experimental. These included wind-turbine generators, magnetic-levitation train demonstrations, short electrical transmission cables, magnetic-resonance imaging machines and, notably, in the electromagnet coils for experimental tokamak fusion reactors.

The tokamak application, at a fusion startup called Commonwealth Fusion Systems, is particularly relevant because to make coils, engineers had to invent a process for turning the normally brittle copper-oxide superconducting material into a tape that could be used to form donut-shaped coils capable of sustaining very high current flow and therefore very intense magnetic fields.

“Having a superconductor to provide such a large current is desirable because it doesn’t generate heat,” says He. “That means, first, you have much less energy lost directly from the coils themselves. And, second, you don’t require as much cooling power to remove the heat.”

Still, the technical hurdles are substantial. “One can argue that inside the motor, intense heat will still need to be removed due to aerodynamic friction,” He says. “Then it becomes, how do you manage the overall heat within the motor?”

An engineer at Air Liquide Advanced Technologies works on a test of a hydrogen storage and distribution system at the Liquid Hydrogen Breadboard in November, 2024. The “Breadboard” was established last year in Grenoble, France, by Air Liquide and Airbus.Céline Sadonnet/Master Films

For this challenge, engineers will at least have a favorable environment with cold, fast-flowing air. Engineers will be able to tap into the “massive air flow” over the motors and other components to assist the cooling, He suggests. Smart design could “take advantage of this kinetic energy of flowing air.”

To test the evolving fuel-cell propulsion system, Airbus has built a unique test center in Grenoble called the “Liquid Hydrogen Breadboard,” Llewellyn disclosed at the Summit. “We partnered with Air Liquide Advanced Technologies” to build the facility, he said. “This Breadboard is a versatile test platform designed to simulate key elements of future aircraft architecture: tanks, valves, pipes, and pumps, allowing us to validate different configurations at full scale. And this test facility is helping us gain critical insight into safety, hydrogen operations, tank design, refueling, venting, and gauging.”

“Throughout 2025, we’re going to continue testing the complete liquid-hydrogen and distribution system,” Llewellyn added. “And by 2027, our objective is to take an even further major step forward, testing the complete end-to-end system, including the fuel-cell engine and the liquid hydrogen storage and distribution system together, which will allow us to assess the full system in action.”

UK Requirement The UK SAF mandate sets targets for aviation fuel suppliers to provide increasing amounts of SAF from 2025 to 2040.
The mandate is being enforced by a tradable certificate plan for aviation fuel suppliers.
Conclusion Europe is moving along with its net-zero plans for 2050, including its targets for sustainable aviation fuel.
SAF is three to five times more expensive than jet fuel and could make flying so expensive that only a privileged few will be able to fly in the future unless technology and demand can produce SAF to be competitive with current aviation fuels.","The CEO of Qantas Airlines, Vanessa Hudson, said that flying may become so expensive that it would only be available for the privileged under a “net zero” policy requiring sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). SAF’s higher “clean fuel” costs threaten to put airfares out of reach of the masses. SAF costs three to five times as much as kerosene and is currently the only realistic path to achieving the aviation industry’s net-zero carbon emissions target by 2050. Fuel is the costliest input in air transportation operations. SAF is most commonly produced from cooking oil obtained in Asia.

Britain has issued a mandate for carriers to use at least 10% SAF by 2030 —one of the most stringent requirements in the world. The EU target is lower — 6% SAF by 2030. Airbus is planning to fly its future planes on SAF, adding an expensive “green premium” to air fares. Last year, SAF made up less than 1% of industry-wide fuel consumption due to its high price and low production. SAF is estimated to reduce life-cycle carbon dioxide emissions by around 80% compared with traditional jet fuel.

The UK SAF mandate sets targets for aviation fuel suppliers to provide increasing amounts of SAF from 2025 to 2040. In 2025, 2% of the jet fuel supplied in the UK must be SAF, increasing linearly to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040. The UK government has a price guarantee mechanism to help increase SAF production and encourage the development of a large-scale refinery in the UK.

The mandate is being enforced by a tradable certificate plan for aviation fuel suppliers. Suppliers receive a certificate proportional to the amount of greenhouse gas emissions reduction they achieved in the previous year, which can be used to meet the mandate. Excess certificates can be sold to other suppliers who may need additional certificates. The mandate program also contains a buy-out mechanism that allows suppliers to discharge their obligations if they cannot secure a supply of SAF by imports or domestic production. The program also sets a maximum price for the certificates to prevent excessive costs from being passed on to consumers.

The UK currently has only one SAF production facility, owned by Phillips 66. It is located in Yorkshire and co-processes waste oils. The refinery is expected to produce approximately 50 million liters of SAF this year. Eight more SAF production facilities have been announced. However, experts have expressed doubts about whether production can be scaled up quickly enough to meet the UK’s aggressive schedule.

Airbus Plans

By the end of 2025, all Airbus customers can receive their aircraft with SAF anywhere, free of charge. In 2024, 75% of the 766 Airbus aircraft deliveries used a SAF fuel blend. Recently, Airbus has been increasing the percentage of SAF used in its internal operations to 16%, including in business travel, delivery flights, and transportation of aircraft parts between different production sites. Airbus has signed agreements with SAF providers like TotalEnergies, who have been providing SAF for aircraft deliveries in Toulouse since 2016. TotalEnergies supplies more than half of the SAF that Airbus needs in Europe.

Airbus also recently unveiled a blueprint for a new generation of narrow-body planes capable of running off 100% SAF. Current plans for the aircraft, to be introduced after 2035, feature composite wings that are much longer and narrower than existing models. The supersized wings create more lift, reduce drag, and lower fuel burn. Their increased length means that the wings will need to fold in order to use existing airport gates. Airbus also confirmed that it had shelved studies for a jet engine-powered plane that would burn hydrogen instead of kerosene.

Conclusion

Europe is moving along with its net-zero plans for 2050, including its targets for sustainable aviation fuel. SAF is three to five times more expensive than jet fuel and could make flying so expensive that only a privileged few will be able to fly in the future unless technology and demand can produce SAF to be competitive with current aviation fuels. Airbus is changing the design of its planes to make them more aerodynamic and able to use 100% SAF more economically. The design will be introduced after 2035. Airbus currently uses 16% SAF for its internal operations and delivers Airbus planes with an SAF blend to 75% of its customers. The UK currently requires 2% SAF in its jet fuel and mandates 10% by 2030. The EU’s requirement by 2030 is less than 6%. Europe continues to layer costs upon its citizenry to comply with the UN’s Paris Accords, even when it means pricing much of its population out of the convenience of modern transportation.",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bigstock-Empty-Airplane-Inside-With-Sma-359704195.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 11:56:28.059678

The report highlights several key initiatives, focusing on advancements in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a significant reduction in single-use plastics, and initiatives designed to foster community engagement in Hong Kong and beyond.

The airline’s Chief Executive Officer, Ronald Lam, explained that the airline has now laid a solid foundation for future development. After a challenging two years of recovery, Cathay Pacific is now focused on driving sustainable growth, with the aim of improving not only its operational efficiency but also its positive contribution to the global travel industry and communities it serves.

Advancing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Usage

One of the standout achievements highlighted in the report was Cathay Pacific’s increased use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which has been a key component of the airline’s sustainability strategy. As part of its commitment to reducing carbon emissions, Cathay Pacific has partnered with HSBC Hong Kong and EcoCeres to facilitate the introduction of SAF at Hong Kong International Airport. This collaboration also led to the formation of the Hong Kong Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition (HKSAFC). The coalition aims to drive the policy development needed to accelerate SAF adoption in the region.

According to the airline’s report, the Corporate SAF Programme has seen extraordinary growth, with Cathay Pacific increasing its SAF usage by an impressive 22 times compared to 2022. This marks a significant step forward in the airline’s broader strategy to reduce its carbon footprint, positioning Cathay Pacific as a global leader in adopting more sustainable aviation practices. By using SAF, which is made from renewable resources, the airline aims to lower the net carbon emissions of its flights, ultimately helping to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

For global travelers, this development signals a future where flying can become less harmful to the environment. As more airlines follow Cathay Pacific’s lead in using SAF, the aviation industry’s collective impact on the planet could be drastically reduced, making air travel more sustainable for future generations.

Promoting Circular Economy and Reducing Plastic Waste

In addition to its efforts in aviation fuel, Cathay Pacific has focused on improving its waste management practices. The airline has made significant progress in reducing single-use plastics (SUP), a major contributor to global pollution. In its 2024 report, Cathay Pacific revealed that the airline had reduced passenger-facing SUP items to an average of just 2.6 pieces per passenger. This achievement was a critical part of the airline’s sustainability goals and aligns with global efforts to combat plastic pollution.

Looking ahead, Cathay Pacific has set ambitious goals for 2025. These include increasing the recycling rate of inflight water bottles to 33% and ensuring that at least 50% of remaining SUP items are made from recycled plastics. Furthermore, Cathay Pacific introduced a recycling workflow at Hong Kong International Airport for plastic bottles and cans. This initiative is part of the airline’s broader strategy to embrace a circular economy, where resources are reused and recycled rather than discarded.

For the travel industry, this shift towards reducing plastic waste is likely to have a profound impact on how airports and airlines manage waste and sustainability. As travelers become more environmentally conscious, they may choose airlines and airports that prioritize eco-friendly practices, such as Cathay Pacific’s commitment to reducing plastic use and improving recycling programs.

Engaging with the Community: Cathay’s Commitment to Youth Development

Beyond its environmental initiatives, Cathay Pacific has demonstrated a strong commitment to community engagement, particularly through its flagship youth development programme, “I Can Fly”. In 2024, the programme celebrated its 20th anniversary, marking a significant milestone in its efforts to provide young people with the skills, knowledge, and experiences they need to succeed in the modern workforce. After a five-year hiatus, the programme returned and expanded its reach with an exchange tour that included visits to cities within the Greater Bay Area.

The “I Can Fly” programme has always been a way for Cathay Pacific to inspire young people in Hong Kong and beyond. It focuses on teaching leadership, teamwork, and career development, providing opportunities for participants to gain practical knowledge and insight into the aviation industry. As Cathay Pacific continues to nurture future talent, the programme plays an integral role in shaping the careers of young people who may one day enter the travel and aviation sectors, helping to diversify and strengthen the future workforce.

For the global travel industry, community engagement programmes like “I Can Fly” serve as a reminder of the importance of developing local talent and fostering youth involvement in aviation. The next generation of aviation professionals is crucial for the future of the industry, and Cathay Pacific’s efforts in this area could inspire other airlines to create similar initiatives that offer young people pathways into the aviation and travel sectors.

Setting Clear Sustainability Goals for the Future

Looking toward the future, Cathay Pacific has set clear, measurable sustainability goals for the next decade. The airline has committed to reducing cabin waste to just 0.63 kg per passenger by 2030, representing a 30% reduction from the 2019 baseline. This ambitious target is part of a broader commitment to achieve long-term sustainability, focusing on both reducing the environmental impact of air travel and enhancing passenger experience.

As part of this goal, Cathay Pacific is also focused on enhancing its inflight service offerings by reducing waste, improving energy efficiency, and implementing more sustainable operational practices. By integrating these initiatives into its day-to-day operations, Cathay Pacific aims to lead by example and inspire the rest of the aviation industry to adopt similar practices.

SAF or biojet is a renewable fuel approved for commercial airlines and can be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel. However, SAF production presents unique operational challenges associated with feedstock variability and conversion processes.

In an article published in Hydrocarbon Processing magazine, Lara Petrishchev and Julie Valentine share measurement instrumentation strategies for navigating the complexities of biofuel production, especially within the hydrotreatment process unit of the refining process.

SAF Production Challenges

SAF is produced through lipid conversion processes, utilizing renewable feedstocks rich in oil, such as used cooking oil, oil-bearing plants like rapeseed and soybeans, and tallow. These feedstocks undergo pretreatment to eliminate contaminants that can harm reactor catalysts and to break them down into consistent intermediates that feed the hydrotreating and isomerization reactors.

Despite the pretreatment process of bio-based feedstocks, SAF feedstocks present unique challenges:

• They tend to be more corrosive, leading to operational issues.

• Their variability adds another layer of complexity.

In addition, the SAF refining process demands significantly more hydrogen (H2) and operates at elevated pressures and temperatures.

Improving Process Control

To optimize the operation of the hydrotreatment and isomerization unit, strategically deploying measurement sensors is critical to improving visibility into process conditions for better decision-making.

Controlling Highly Exothermic Reactions:

Temperature transmitters with advanced diagnostics and dual hot backup capabilities are vital for monitoring reactor temperatures and ensuring process safety.

Quad vortex flow meters provide redundant flow measurements for hydrogen treat gas, purge streams, and reactor recycle flow, preventing temperature excursions. With a two-out-of-three (2oo3) voting SIL-3 configuration, they enhance both safety and process control.

Differential pressure transmitters monitor pressure drop across reactor beds, indicating potential catalyst fouling.

Monitoring Yields and Catalyst Deactivation Rate:

Coriolis meters are crucial for the main feed, hydrogen, and product streams. Their ability to measure both mass flow and density enables accurate mass balance data for yield monitoring and catalyst evaluation.

Corrosion Monitoring:

Wireless ultrasonic corrosion sensors provide real-time indication of metal loss and monitoring of pipe wall thickness. This helps ensure equipment integrity given the variable and often more corrosive nature of renewable feedstocks. Check out this article for more insights on managing corrosion risk in biofuels processing.

Hydrogen Purity Monitoring

Continuous gas analyzers and gas chromatographs play a critical role in monitoring the purity of hydrogen streams for optimal conversion rates. They also track H2S in the recycle stream for better reaction control.

Energy Efficiency & Emissions

Continuous gas analyzers and Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS) provide real-time data to quantify greenhouse gas emissions.

Real-time monitoring of flows, temperatures, and pressures of both process and transfer fluids in heat exchangers provides early detection of equipment fouling. The measurements optimize heat transfer and significantly reduce energy waste and emissions.

Simplifying Regulatory Reporting

Automated level and flow metering instrumentation with onboard diagnostics facilitates accurate fluid transfer measurements and reporting, ensuring compliance with regulations. This includes custody chain documentation, invoices, transportation, and audit trails critical to securing government subsidies.",https://www.emersonautomationexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 12:57:22.353540

“This is great news – not just for the hydrogen sector but for the UK’s ambition to become energy secure and a global leader in clean energy.” Clare Jackson, CEO of Hydrogen UK, said: “We’re thrilled to see many Hydrogen UK members succeed in the second Hydrogen Allocation Round, marking a crucial step for scaling electrolytic hydrogen.
“This progress builds on valuable lessons from past rounds and strengthens UK leadership in clean energy – reinforcing the sector’s crucial role in economic growth and energy security.”","A new wave of hydrogen powered projects was shortlisted on Monday April 7, 2025, to help cut emissions and create thousands of jobs in the UK’s industrial heartlands – driving growth as part of the government’s Plan for Change.

Twenty-seven hydrogen projects have been selected for the next stage of the Second Hydrogen Allocation Round (HAR2) – supporting low-carbon hydrogen production in the UK. The industry has the potential to attract over £1 billion of private sector investment into the UK by 2029, supporting the government’s mission to become a clean energy superpower.

Hydrogen will help deliver a new era of clean energy across the UK and decarbonise emission-intensive industries. It has already attracted £400 million of private sector investment in towns and cities such as Milford Haven in Wales and High Marnham in Nottinghamshire and is creating over 700 direct jobs in construction and operations.

Government support for hydrogen will help create thousands more jobs in the sector and reindustrialising the UK’s proud manufacturing regions. This includes roles for apprentices, graduates and technically trained professionals, such as engineers, welders, skilled construction workers, pipefitters and operations specialists.

Monday’s shortlist includes projects that could use hydrogen to help tackle the climate crisis by decarbonising their manufacturing and industrial practices, including ammonia production, new clean power generation, glass manufacturing, brick making, and sustainable aviation fuel production.

Industry Minister, Sarah Jones, said: “We are deploying hydrogen at a commercial scale for the first time – not just investing in a technology – but investing in British jobs, our proud manufacturing communities and our energy security.

“From distilleries and sustainable aviation fuel to public transport and clean energy generation, hydrogen can power our everyday life and unlock clean energy growth across the country as part of our Plan for Change.”

Green hydrogen is produced by using renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, resulting in a zero-carbon fuel that can be used for power generation, transport and industrial processes.

This builds on the success of the First Hydrogen Allocation Round which saw 11 projects being allocated over £2 billion in government funding. One recipient, Whitelee Green Hydrogen in Scotland, will produce hydrogen for the Inchdairnie Whiskey distillery which intends to sustainably distil whisky by 2027.

Stretching across England, Scotland, and Wales, this latest wave of shortlisted HAR2 projects showcases the government’s commitment to create skilled jobs and establish clean energy hubs across Great Britain. The HAR2 shortlist could lead to projects that help support strong supply chains and the delivery of the clean energy superpower mission.

Dr Emma Guthrie, CEO of the Hydrogen Energy Association, said: “This much-anticipated announcement brings vital clarity to the UK’s hydrogen sector, providing a crucial boost for projects that will drive forward the country’s low-carbon transition.

“The funding support offered through HAR2 gives our members and the wider industry the confidence to gear up for delivery, unlocking investment, creating jobs, and driving economic growth.

Future Energy Global is backed by Aviation Partners, the world leader in advanced winglet technology which has already saved more than 140 million tons of aviation CO2 emissions.","ENGLEWOOD, Colo., April 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ: GEVO) and Future Energy Global (FEG) are pleased to announce that they have signed a pioneering offtake agreement for carbon abatement attributes, to enable airlines and other companies to reduce their CO2 emissions through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Under the multi-year agreement, FEG will acquire from Gevo the Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions credits from 10 million gallons per year of fuel to be produced at Gevo’s alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) SAF production facility, Gevo ATJ-60, to meet demand from FEG customers, both airlines and corporates, seeking to decarbonize their operations. The agreement also includes an option for FEG to increase the off-take at a later date.

This agreement is expected to enable Gevo’s financing of the construction of its ATJ-60 facility. Gevo has secured a loan guarantee conditional commitment of $1.63 billion (including capitalized interest during construction) from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Loan Programs Office (LPO) and is originating equity from project level capital providers. Under development in Lake Preston, South Dakota, ATJ-60 is designed to address the market need for cost-effective jet fuel while abating carbon and to respond to growing worldwide demand for SAF. Gevo's proprietary plant design is expected to be able to produce 60 million gallons of SAF per year at similar production costs to conventional jet fuel, but with far lower carbon emissions.

The aviation industry has targeted net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, and SAF is expected to contribute around two thirds of the necessary emissions reduction, but to achieve this, its production quantities need to scale more than 400-fold. SAF is not yet available at all major airports worldwide so FEG provides SAF-derived Scope 1 credits to airlines who wish to buy additional SAF but who cannot easily source the physical fuel at their own airports. Similarly, when companies purchase and retire SAF-derived Scope 3 credits to compensate for their business travel emissions, they mitigate the added cost of SAF to airlines and thus enable the faster scale-up of SAF production.

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol defines different “scopes” of responsibility for emissions. The emissions from a flight fall under an airline’s direct responsibility (i.e., Scope 1), but a company with staff flying for business on that flight is responsible for its staff’s share of the flight’s emissions (i.e., Scope 3 or indirect emissions). Separating the Scope 1 and Scope 3 attributes from the physical fuel, an approach known as “Book and Claim,” reduces fuel transportation and storage costs and carbon emissions, and unlocks a global SAF market both for airlines and for indirect aviation fuel customers around the world who are seeking to mitigate their emissions.

“Gevo has always planned to leverage SAF market economics to scale our business, and a Book and Claim market that enables the trading of SAF environmental attributes can accelerate SAF production even faster,” says Dr. Patrick R. Gruber, CEO of Gevo. “Future Energy Global is building just such a market, spanning corporate customers, airlines, and aircraft lessors. Aircraft lessors own about half of all commercial aircraft worldwide, and Book and Claim is a critical enabler to allow them and their airline customers to adopt SAF faster.”

“FEG’s collaboration with Gevo strongly enhances the portfolio of Book and Claim solutions we can offer our airlines, our lessors and our corporate customers,” says Natasha Mann, CEO and Co-Founder of FEG. “It’s crucial to scale SAF production, and our business model lets us unlock the capital to do so. We’re impressed with Gevo’s pipeline, which combines technology ready for today’s market and additional technologies far along in development that could increase production efficiency and accelerate the trajectory of SAF scaling.”

FEG’s unique business model brings together investors, suppliers, and buyers to help accelerate and scale SAF production globally. FEG generates additional revenue streams by commercializing the carbon credits which SAF provides, enhancing the business case for faster production scale-up. FEG’s offtake agreement with Gevo is expected to fulfill a market need by giving buyers access to SAF credits at predictable prices, while providing financial commitments and revenue certainty that are expected to allow suppliers like Gevo to expand. FEG’s initial focus has been on aviation, though its sustainable-fuel credit solutions span the transport spectrum, including marine and land transport.

About Book and Claim

Book and Claim is a well-established structure for accounting for environmental attributes and has been in use for many years in markets such as renewable electricity generation, where individual electrons cannot be tracked through the grid. Book and Claim systems overcome this challenge by allowing renewable electricity providers to “book” the electricity they supply to the grid, while customers can “claim” the renewable electricity they have bought, whether or not they physically receive the renewable electrons. Book and Claim systems, whether in renewable electricity or in SAF, rely on robust tracking and accounting procedures to ensure that environmental credits are counted only once.

Whilst only a preliminary plan, the development will take place in 2-3 phases, with the first planned to be operational around 2034-2036.

Additionally, ABO will explore the possibility of producing methanol and sustainable aviation fuel (e-SAF) in Oulu – however, this will depend on the availability of biogenic carbon dioxide. The company would offer the waste heat generated for use as district heating in the region.

ABO Energy Suomi Oy, owned by ABO Energy KGaA, will implement the plant in the industrial area of Pyyryväinen.

As the land reservation is only a preliminary decision, a final investment decision (FID) will be made at a later date.

Finland was chosen due to its cheap electricity prices, ABO said in an online statement. Head of Development at ABO Energy Finland, Amanda Cardwell, explained, “Finland is an incredibly attractive destination for investment, thanks to our abundant, affordable green electricity and exceptional capacity to scale up production.”

Furthermore, the Oulu region is reportedly the largest producer of renewable electricity in Finland. “Our unique strength as a company lies in our ability to supply renewable energy to hydrogen projects directly through our wind energy portfolio,” Cardwell added.

ECO2FLY combines the sustainability of a business of great importance to the surrounding area, such as the cement industry, with the creation of a new industry for decarbonization, which will generate employment and wealth for the region, José Antonio Membiela said.

A leading position

The combination of technology and production capacity for the fuel of the future of aviation positions ECO2FLY as a leader in Europe for the decarbonization of key development sectors considered difficult to decarbonize.

In this context, over the first ten years of operation, ECO2FLY will avoid emissions of over 6.5 million tonnes of CO2.

At ECO2FLY, companies have come together from different sectors, all of them key for society like construction, energy, mobility, tourism and logistics.

In this regard, Ignacio Casajús, Global Strategy & Growth Lead at Exolum, highlighted how “Exolum is making a firm commitment to the development of partnerships that allow the development of sustainable fuels that, as of today, are presented as the only viable solution to reducing carbon emissions in the short term in sectors like aviation and shipping”.

An opportunity for Europe

This partnership is an example of how inter-sectoral collaboration allows Europe to tackle challenges it faces successfully.

This project will be submitted to the next call of the European Union Innovation Funds. Its roll-out will not only contribute to the energy transition and help achieve net zero emissions, but it will also drive the position of Spain and the European Union as a leader in industrial innovation and sustainability, strengthening our energy independence.

This project is an opportunity to be leaders in Europe in the production of eSAF, which represents an enormous strategic value for the Spanish economy. It will be the start of a new industry that will create employment and wealth, and a new energy paradigm for the country, with the opportunity to become exporters of renewable fuel on a large scale for the first time, ended Javier Esteban, Director of the Consortium and Partner of P2X Spain.",https://bioenergyinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/schematiceco2fly.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 12:57:25.781390

The aim is to produce one hundred thousand tons of sustainable aviation fuel annually, known as eSAF, which is made from water, renewable electricity, and captured carbon dioxide.
This type of aviation fuel will become required for European airlines starting in 2030.
Today, he considers them the best in the world when it comes to sustainable aviation fuel.
Back to Joachim Nordin at Skellefteå Kraft, who at this point cannot say for sure how Skellefteå Kraft will act in the future.","The planned aviation fuel factory at Näsudden in Skelleftehamn is a significant hydrogen project. The aim is to produce one hundred thousand tons of sustainable aviation fuel annually, known as eSAF, which is made from water, renewable electricity, and captured carbon dioxide.

This type of aviation fuel will become required for European airlines starting in 2030. Initially, it will need to make up 0.7 percent of total fuel use, increasing to at least 25 percent by 2050.

– This will create a large new market, Maarten van Dijk, CEO of the Dutch company SkyNRG, told Norran.

SkyNRG, pronounced Sky Energy, has been working with sustainable aviation fuel since 2009. Together with the company's co-founder, KLM Airlines, they were the first in the world to use this type of fuel on a commercial flight in 2011.

Since then, they have continued to gain market share in the industry.

– We've had both a short-term strategy where we simply bought and resold fuel, and a long-term strategy focused on building our own factories, says Maarten.

Maarten van Dijk, CEO of SkyNRG, being interviewed by Norran via video link. He co-founded SkyNRG in 2009 and has worked in various roles at the company since then.

Currently, they have one factory being built in the Netherlands and two more planned. One of them is in the USA – and the other is in Skellefteå.

– We looked at sites in Amsterdam, Germany, Canada, the Middle East, Australia, and Brazil – but ultimately, we decided that northern Sweden is the best place.

Why is that?

– There are mainly two important reasons. We need a completely green electricity network and available carbon dioxide from sources that aren't fossil fuels, like the forestry industry. This makes Skellefteå a very good location, says Maarten, who also mentions that other vital factors are the existing electricity and transportation infrastructure.

En tidig illustration av hur flygbränslefabriken på Näsudden kan komma att se ut. Kapaciteten som planeras, hundra tusen ton eSAF, beräknas täcka uppskattningsvis en sjättedel av det lagstadgade behovet i Europa 2030, baserat på de senaste flygbränsleprognoserna för EU, enligt SkyNRG.

To make this investment happen, SkyNRG teamed up with Skellefteå Kraft and created a joint company called SkyKraft AB.

However, when Joachim Nordin, CEO of the city-owned Skellefteå Kraft, first heard about SkyNRG, he didn’t know who they were.

– We had to do very careful checks. There were many other companies also talking to us, he told Norran.

Today, he considers them the best in the world when it comes to sustainable aviation fuel.

– We’ve visited their headquarters twice and met their board, management, suppliers, and owners. After the second visit, I felt completely sure – they are the best partner for this, says Joachim, who also points out that the Australian investment bank Macquarie Asset Management has invested 1.9 billion kronor in SkyNRG as proof that they are the right partner.

""Just because we’ve made money in the past doesn’t mean we can sit back and assume it will continue. The world around us and our conditions are changing – and so must we,"" says Joachim Nordin.

That Skellefteå Kraft should be involved in a project like this is, according to Joachim, completely obvious.

He believes that as an energy company, Skellefteå Kraft ""can't just keep doing things the way they've always been done"" without risking their profits.

– Just because we've made money in the past doesn't mean we can relax and expect it to continue. The world around us is changing – and so must we, says Joachim, pointing out that there's a large surplus of electricity in northern Sweden, which leads to lower earnings for energy companies.

Selling all the extra electricity to the south isn't possible because the power grid has limitations. According to him, Skellefteå Kraft instead needs to, for example through a sustainable aviation fuel plant, process its green energy locally, while also using the leftover heat to warm Skellefteå’s district heating system.

The latter is currently losing money.

– A project like this is the solution to our two biggest strategic problems, he says.

At Hedensbyn, a pilot plant for hydrogen production is being planned. Skellefteå Kraft is building it themselves, with help from, among others, EU funding. According to Joachim Nordin, the pilot plant is expected to be ready in 2026, provided all permits are granted. “The facility in Skelleftehamn is 100–150 times larger than this one, but it’s important for us to learn, for example, how to make use of waste heat,” says Joachim.

But who will pay for the construction of the factory, which is estimated to cost between 20 and 25 billion kronor? Norran asked this question to both Maarten and Joachim. Both answer that the largest part will be financed by banks and other external investors.

SkyNRG, which is backed by the giant investment bank Macquarie, also plans to invest significant capital in the operation itself.

– We are here to stay for the next 40 years, or more, and run the factory. We will not ask Skellefteå Kraft to run it. If they think it’s a good business opportunity to invest in, they can do so; if not, that’s also okay with us, says Maarten.

A potential decision on whether Skellefteå Kraft will invest larger sums will come later. So far, according to Joachim, besides working hours and some overhead costs, they have only invested 24,500 kronor, which is 49 percent of the share capital in SkyKraft AB.

How much Skellefteå Kraft is willing to invest in total, Joachim cannot say, but he admits that he has no problem investing one hundred million kronor, which is the same amount they invested in Northvolt, which recently went bankrupt.

– Even though I wasn't CEO when the decision to invest in Northvolt was made, I would argue that it was a very good decision by Skellefteå Kraft. We have received much more back than that over these years, both directly and indirectly. From a business perspective, we can easily invest 100 million kronor in a project like this, he says.

The number of employees at the factory is estimated to be around 50–100 people. “It’s not a Northvolt in terms of number of employees,” says Joachim Nordin.

If Skellefteå Kraft is to invest larger sums than that, a decision needs to be made by the politicians in the municipal council, Joachim emphasises.

Furthermore, investing larger amounts will only happen in the next phase when more details are available and agreements with future customers are to be signed.

Maarten describes the project in four different financial phases, where varying amounts of money need to be invested to move on to the next.

– In an early stage, perhaps 5 million kronor were needed, and in phase two, where we are now, around 20-30 million kronor are needed, he says.

– In the next phase after that, an estimated 500 million kronor will be needed, and then we will have a discussion with Skellefteå Kraft about whether they want to join that phase. After that will come the really large costs for building the factory.

Approximately 20 billion kronor, according to Maarten.

– Then I imagine that 70 percent will be financed with bank loans, and 30 percent will come from equity. Then the question is whether everything will be owned by SkyNRG, by SkyNRG and Skellefteå Kraft, or by SkyNRG and external investors who want to invest in this type of infrastructure, says Maarten.

""We are very aware of risks and extremely careful before making decisions, especially after all the media attention on Skellefteå Kraft as a part-owner of Northvolt. But at the same time, every business involves some kind of risk, and I wouldn’t be a good CEO if I avoided all risks.""

Back to Joachim Nordin at Skellefteå Kraft, who at this point cannot say for sure how Skellefteå Kraft will act in the future. However, he emphasizes that they will carefully consider the risks.

– We are very aware of risks and are extremely careful before making decisions, especially after all the media attention that has been on Skellefteå Kraft as a co-owner of Northvolt. But at the same time, all business involves some type of risk, and I wouldn't be a good CEO if I avoided all risks, says Joachim.

Does a municipally-owned company really need to be involved in a project like this? If it's such a good opportunity, wouldn't private businesses find it attractive?

– I don't think this would become a reality if Skellefteå Kraft wasn't involved as an important partner, and IF it were to happen anyway, it's not certain that the operation would be integrated with our heating network and that we would be the ones selling the electricity. We are doing this because it is best for Skellefteå Kraft and for the people of Skellefteå, says Joachim.",https://cdn.ntm.se/api/v1/images/jpmek2kj/smart/width/1200/height/630,N,,2025-04-09 09:56:44.988973

Touted for its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel, SAF is poised to transform air travel into a greener industry. Yet, its trajectory hasn’t been smooth—especially in the U.S., where economic policy during the Trump administration reshaped the outlook of the SAF market in unforeseen ways.

During his presidency, Donald Trump’s hardline approach to trade led to a sweeping tariff regime targeting China, the European Union, and other key trading partners. The goal was to revitalize U.S. manufacturing and reduce trade imbalances, but the ripple effects across various industries—particularly renewable energy and sustainable fuels—were significant.

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel market, still in its developmental stages, faced heightened uncertainty, higher input costs, and disrupted global partnerships. In this article, we explore the multifaceted impact of Trump-era tariffs on the SAF landscape and how the market is working to regain its momentum in a post-tariff economy.

Rewriting the Rules: How Trump Tariffs Restructured the SAF Ecosystem

SAF production relies on a complex web of global supply chains. Equipment, feedstocks, and conversion technologies often span continents. When tariffs on raw materials like aluminum, steel, and refining machinery were imposed, SAF infrastructure projects in the U.S. saw cost overruns that derailed timelines and reduced investor confidence.

At the same time, tariffs on agricultural products like soybeans and corn—critical feedstocks for many SAF technologies—added volatility to input pricing. These policies created a domino effect: fewer investments, reduced R&D budgets, and a reluctance from airlines to commit to large-scale SAF procurement amid fluctuating prices.

Trade Wars Leave Deep Scars on SAF Development

Although the trade war officially cooled off near the end of Trump’s term, its economic aftershocks continue to shape SAF development today. In the early years of SAF commercialization, stability was crucial—yet the trade war fostered an environment of unpredictability.

Joint ventures with foreign companies suffered. U.S.-based SAF firms that relied on European biofuel tech found themselves blocked by tariffs and supply delays. Airlines that had announced pilot SAF programs postponed their rollouts due to rising costs and regulatory confusion.

As a result, the U.S. fell behind global peers. Europe, despite also being targeted by tariffs, surged ahead with strong regulatory support and an aggressive SAF adoption roadmap. The U.S., by contrast, entered a holding pattern.

Post-Tariff Adaptation: A Smarter, Stronger SAF Market?

With the Biden administration rolling back some of the most disruptive trade policies, the SAF industry is slowly finding its footing. One major pivot has been toward domestic resilience.

Companies have begun seeking U.S.-based alternatives for SAF feedstocks and processing equipment. There’s now a strong emphasis on innovation within national borders. This has led to the acceleration of new technologies that rely on waste oils, municipal waste, and non-food biomass—inputs less dependent on international trade.

This period of recalibration has also encouraged vertical integration. SAF producers increasingly want to control every stage of the value chain, from sourcing raw material to refining to distribution. It’s not just about green fuel anymore—it’s about ensuring security of supply.

The New Energy Independence: Can America Sustain Itself?

Trump’s vision of American self-sufficiency inadvertently sparked a shift in thinking within the SAF sector. While energy independence was historically associated with oil, it’s now equally relevant to sustainable fuel.

The U.S. has the resources—vast farmlands, innovation hubs, and engineering prowess—to become a leader in SAF. Success depends on sustained government incentives, cross-sector collaboration, and a clear national SAF strategy.

Federal programs like the SAF Grand Challenge aim to produce 3 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2030. But achieving this goal without international cooperation—particularly on technology and certification frameworks—remains a formidable task. Going it alone might yield limited progress.

Agricultural Turbulence: How Tariffs on Crops Shook the SAF Supply Chain

The trade war’s impact on agriculture cannot be overstated. China’s retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybeans caused exports to plummet. This led to gluts in domestic markets, causing soybean prices to crash temporarily—appearing to benefit SAF producers using soy-based fuels.

The instability proved harmful in the long run. Farmers scaled back production or shifted to other crops, making feedstock sourcing less predictable. Contracts for long-term SAF supply, which depend on feedstock price certainty, became harder to negotiate.

Beyond soy, corn, canola, and even used cooking oil faced similar challenges. The result was a fractured feedstock landscape that disrupted many SAF pilot projects and commercial scale-ups.

Financial Fallout: What the Trade War Cost the SAF Industry

SAF has always carried a green premium—it costs more to produce than fossil-based jet fuel. But the Trump administration’s tariffs amplified that gap. Construction of SAF plants became significantly more expensive due to tariffs on steel and advanced machinery.

In turn, this increased the price of the final product, making it harder to secure long-term contracts with airlines. Airlines, pressured by shareholders and passengers to go green, found themselves unable to meet their SAF goals without incurring unsustainable costs.

The government did step in with grants and subsidies, but the inconsistency of support—coupled with market instability—slowed down investor enthusiasm. Many early-stage SAF ventures went dormant, and those that survived had to scale back their ambitions.

Green Goals vs. Trade Walls: A Conflict of Priorities

While the trade war was rooted in economic nationalism, climate change is a global problem. In that sense, the Trump-era policies worked against international collaboration—an essential ingredient for accelerating SAF adoption.

The result? U.S. participation in international SAF efforts was weakened. The European Union doubled down on its Green Deal and continued developing SAF capacity. Asia-Pacific nations, like Japan and Singapore, increased investments in SAF refining capabilities.

This shift allowed other regions to pull ahead in the race for SAF dominance. The U.S., once a front-runner in clean tech, became a cautionary tale of how protectionism can backfire on sustainability goals.

Rebuilding Confidence: Evolving SAF Investment and Policy Post-Tariffs

Since the Trump administration ended, U.S. policy has taken a more pragmatic turn. The Biden administration has restored diplomatic ties and promoted SAF through legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act, which offers tax incentives to biofuel producers.

Private capital is also returning. SAF companies are now securing funding rounds again, and new public-private partnerships are being announced. Airlines have renewed their commitments, some even investing directly into SAF startups to lock in future supply.

Investors are now smarter—many build geopolitical risk into their financial models and prioritize projects with strong domestic foundations. The goal is no longer just profitability, but resilience in a shifting global landscape.

A Global Shake-Up: Who Benefited and Who Lost?

The U.S. retreat created opportunities for other nations. The EU strengthened its position as a global SAF leader. Countries like Finland and the Netherlands rapidly built refining capacity and developed export pipelines.

U.S. SAF producers, particularly small and medium enterprises, bore the brunt of uncertainty. Some merged, others downsized, and many shut down. But the ones that endured—often those with unique feedstock access or patented conversion processes—are now stronger for it.

The playing field has changed. Global SAF markets are less centralized, with multiple power centers emerging. For the U.S., the opportunity to lead is still alive, but it requires bridging past mistakes with forward-thinking strategy.

Protectionism’s Double-Edged Sword: A Legacy for SAF

While the Trump tariffs imposed hardships on SAF development, they also sparked new conversations around economic resilience, domestic innovation, and the fragility of global interdependence. The industry’s response—a shift toward diversified supply chains, domestic investment, and innovation—may ultimately prove beneficial.

The future of SAF in America now hinges on building partnerships that balance national interest with global cooperation. That includes streamlining federal policy, supporting scalable SAF technologies, and participating in global certification standards.

If the U.S. can balance trade policy with climate ambition, it still has the chance to lead a more sustainable future in aviation. The Trump-era tariffs were a shock—but one that forced the industry to grow, innovate, and adapt.",,N,,2025-04-09 10:56:38.939324

In the preliminary plan, the new hydrogen plant would have an electrolyser with a maximum capacity of 600MW. Implementation would take place in 2-3 phases.

In addition to hydrogen production, the company is exploring the possibility of producing methanol and sustainable aviation fuel (E-SAF) in Oulu.

The feasibility of synthetic fuel production depends on the availability of biogenic carbon dioxide.

ABO Energy would offer the waste heat generated for use as district heating in the Oulu region.

The first phase is planned to be operational around 2034-2036. For the new green transition industrial area of Pyyryväinen, the plant would be implemented by ABO Energy Suomi Oy, whose parent company is ABO Energy KGaA of Germany.

Amanda Cardwell of ABO Energy Suomi Oy said: ""Finland is an incredibly attractive destination for investment, thanks to our abundant, affordable green electricity and exceptional capacity to scale up production.

""Our unique strength as a company lies in our ability to supply renewable energy to hydrogen projects directly through our wind energy portfolio.""

Electricity in Finland is among the cheapest in Europe. The Oulu region is the largest producer of renewable electricity in Finland.

Several other hydrogen production and H2 derivative projects have already been initiated in the Oulu region.

Gasgrid Finland plans to establish a hydrogen transport infrastructure to connect Oulu's hydrogen production with the rest of Finland and other European countries, including Germany.

Other hydrogen production companies have also decided to invest in Oulu, attracted by the international port of Oulu, biogenic carbon dioxide sources and the European TEN-T transport network.

The University of Oulu is also a centre of hydrogen research, providing the city with both high-quality hydrogen expertise and a large pool of hydrogen specialists to meet companies' workforce needs.

There is no doubting that Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT) has gone from strength to strength over the last decade as its route network has grown, passenger numbers have soared and it has earned itself a reputation for being one of the most innovative gateways in the United States.

It is also one of the most self-contained and sustainably run airports in the nation based on the fact that it is the only airport in the US to have its own microgrid, which provides 100% of its energy needs.

Launched in 2021, the microgrid is powered by five natural gas-fired generators with natural gas drilled from underneath the airport site and nearly 10,000 solar panels.

And true to its pioneering ways which have led to the airport establishing its own on-site innovation lab (xBridge) for developing, trialling, testing and launching new technology, and Neighborhood 91 – a 195-acre hub for additive manufacturing with goods produced on site shipped around the world – PIT is now looking at producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) on the airport campus.

Producing and exporting SAF on-site at PIT

What’s the thinking behind PIT potential leading the way on SAF blending and production?

Christina Cassotis, who celebrated her 10th anniversary as CEO of Pittsburgh International Airport in January 2025, says: “Why not? The world needs it, we want aviation to be more sustainable, and we have the perfect mix of assets and resources to make it happen.

“We sit on 3,500 hectares of land, a lot of which is still open for development. We have pipelines to and from the Ohio River where we get our Jet A fuel, so we could export to the North East, New York, Boston, Washington and mid-Atlantic.

“We are surrounded by millions of acres of corn production in Pennsylvania and Ohio, so we can support our farmers by turning the corn into ethanol which becomes the jet fuel. We build things in Pittsburgh, so we can do it.”

The on-site production of SAF would also generate extra revenue for PIT that will help secure its future and help transition the industry to further reduce CO2 emissions. PIT is, of course, not going to invest its own money on building and operating a SAF refinery, so the undertaking would be in partnership with a third party.

“We didn’t want to run a utility like our microgrid and we don’t want to run a SAF refinery. We want to enable it, be a strategic landlord and benefit from the fuel being produced here,” confirms Cassotis.

There are several collaboration pathways the airport could go down when it comes to SAF production.

CNX, for example, which currently extracts natural gas from the airport site, is working with KeyState Energy to develop a hydrogen hub on the airport that would allow for the production of SAF from hydrogen made from coal mine methane.

PIT is also exploring the option of working with a European company that already has ASTM Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) biofuel in production and in use by the US Air Force elsewhere on the airport site.

If things go well, it is possible that construction of a SAF refinery at PIT could start as early as the end of 2026.

PIT’s transformation over the last decade

The airport’s SAF ambitions are very real, and as PIT has proved with creating its own microgrid and countless other pioneering initiatives over the last decade, if its plans make good business sense, they almost invariably happen.

After all, PIT’s reinvention under Cassotis over the last 10 years really is nothing short of remarkable, particularly when you consider that back then she noted that the airport had to adopt a new business plan and focus on a future as an O&D gateway to finally get over the loss of its status as a US Airways hub.

Innovation, in all its forms, appears to have been the key driver of PIT’s new business plan to make it a better and more efficient airport, less dependent on aviation related revenue, and a key economic generator for the city and region.

While the decision to let go of the idea of PIT regaining its hub status and concentrate on developing its O&D services has proved a masterstroke, with the airport accommodating 9.95 million passengers last year, the most since 2006, on the back of a much expanded route network.

Putting that in some kind of perspective, when Cassotis started at PIT, the airport had service to 37 non-stop destinations across the US and Canada and handled around eight million passengers per annum. Today, the figure stands at 62 non-stop routes and includes international long-haul routes to London (British Airways) and Reykjavik (Icelandair) in Europe as PIT boasts seven more airlines that it had in 2015.

So, reflecting on her 10 years at PIT, is it possible for Cassotis to say what the highs and lows have been during this time?

“That’s a hard one to answer as there’s been lots of a highs and quite a few lows as we’ve faced many obstacles over the years, but I would say putting Pittsburgh back on the global stage from a aviation perspective would be the highlight, as that was always the intention,” enthuses Cassotis.

She notes that passenger traffic has increased by nearly 25% since her arrival and will exceed 10 million in 2025, which it would have done last year if it wasn’t for a global IT outage that downed airline computer systems for 24 hours during the peak summer months.

Cassotis cites the success of getting Pittsburgh to believe and buy into her plan to develop PIT as an O&D gateway as the major turning point for the airport and catalyst for its current growth trajectory.

“I would say that my role has always been sales/business development, which started internally with getting people to believe that there were other ways we could be successful other than as a hub, which was the mindset when I got here,” she explains.

“Back then the community’s understanding of success was tied to regaining our hub status with an airline. So, getting the airport team and then the community to understand that an origin and destination airport could still be a very successful business model for PIT was a really big accomplishment.”

As an aside, Cassotis adds that Pittsburghers have always been fiercely proud and supportive of their airport, so much so in fact that she reveals that this enthusiasm led her to take the job in the first place.

Other achievements Cassotis is proud of PIT achieving in the first decade under her watch include the creation the microgrid, the opening of a childcare centre for airport staff and the new terminal which opens for business later this year.

New terminal

“Built by Pittsburgh for Pittsburgh”, PIT’s new terminal will open later this year – most likely in Q4 – and is expected to take operational efficiency and customer convenience and satisfaction to new levels.

The ongoing $1.57 billion new terminal programme is designed to improve facilities and create a new consolidated terminal that modernises outdated former hub facilities and just make it easier for passengers and staff to use.

What that effectively means is that PIT will get a terminal designed for today’s O&D driven market and not the long gone connecting travellers that accounted for 80% of all passengers when US Airways was the hub carrier.

Indeed, the de-hubbing of PIT left it with plenty of facilities that it just didn’t need any more, including eight miles of baggage belts built for transfer passengers that previously caught connecting flights across the airport campus.

O&D passengers now make up 97% of PIT’s passengers, so the airport simply needs new facilities that will make journeys easier, more convenient and comfortable for passengers and the airlines. Its opening will complement improvements to PIT’s existing ‘airside’ facilities (and eliminate the half-a-mile gap between the terminals) which contain the airport’s X-shaped central core, which according to Cassotis will be gutted and completely redesigned.

“The concourses are getting massive upgrades, the holdrooms, the back of the house and all the systems we couldn’t do preventative maintenance on before are being addressed now, so it’s a lot of fun out there right now,” jokes Cassotis.

According to PIT, the main goals of the new terminal programme include reducing passenger wait and walk times, shortening baggage delivery times, improving the international arrivals process, reducing operations and maintenance costs, providing more public parking spaces and making the airport more efficient and sustainable overall.

Some examples of the improved airport experience the new terminal will bring for passengers include one central security checkpoint instead of the existing two in different buildings, and separate levels for Arrivals and Departures.

It is hoped that the terminal will also end the current confusion passengers face on exiting the airport due to ongoing development work and the confusing layout of existing facilities that sometimes means that arriving passengers have to travel between different levels just to get outside.

In March, it was announced that the construction of the new terminal was 85% complete, ensuring that the facility is on target to open as planned in the second half of 2025.

Guided by the core principles of nature, technology and community, the key design features of the new terminal include:

Four new outdoor terraces – two accessible before security and two beyond.

Structural supports made to look like tree columns and leaf designs in the flooring, paying tribute to Western Pennsylvania’s foliage.

A 4,000 constellation ceiling lights installation, creating a night sky effect.

A new 5,000-space parking structure and roadway system.

The new terminal will have three levels: a commercial kerb on the first floor, an arrivals level on the second floor and a departures level on the third floor.

Technology woven seamlessly into the design concept to improve operations at security and baggage claim.

Prioritising enhancing the passenger experience through a range of design features, the new terminal’s Universal Access features include raised crosswalks with improved lighting, accessible-height ticketing counters, digital wayfinding that offers both visual and audio cues, intuitive layouts to simplify navigation, and outdoor spaces with biophilic design elements.

These enhancements are said to build on Pittsburgh International Airport’s established commitment to inclusivity, best illustrated by Presley’s Place – one of the USA’s first comprehensive sensory rooms designed for travellers with autism and other sensory sensitivities.

The airport believes that facilities like Presley’s Place signal what the future of air travel could look like with regards to being more welcoming and supportive for all passengers.

Cassotis has no doubt that the new terminal will usher in a new era for PIT in terms of operational efficiency, customer service levels and even people’s perceptions of the airport.

“It will be transformative,” enthuses Cassotis. “Every single part of our business will change. The equipment it will utilise will allow us to operate more efficiently and give us data that we never had before to make decisions and do predictive maintenance.

“The new terminal will allow us to do a better job of taking care of staff and passengers. Passengers will enjoy shorter walk times and be guided on their journeys by more intuitive wayfinding. It will be a much more pleasant experience.”

It will also be one of only a handful of airport terminals in the US to have outdoor terraces airside, which like its landside counterparts, will be accessible to all passengers.

Worthy of note is the fact that 16,000 tons of locally fabricated steel have been used in the terminal’s construction.

Energy efficient

The terminal itself is designed around using less energy for heating and cooling through the orientation of the terminal, strategic building overhangs and materials used in construction.

Like the rest of the airport, it will be powered by PIT’s microgrid, which means that the airport is 100% self sufficient in terms of energy supply and able to continue operating if the local grid goes down for whatever reason. On the reverse side of the coin, it also has the capability to switch to the traditional power grid if it experiences issues with its own microgrid.

An added bonus of the microgrid is that it has reduced PIT’s carbon emissions by six million pounds a year, and saved the airport around $1.5 million annually in utility costs.

Passenger growth, routes and destinations

As mentioned earlier, Pittsburgh International Airport handled 9.95 million passengers in 2024 – 8.1% more than the previous year and 166,000 passengers more than in pre-pandemic 2019.

The airport attributes the upturn, and first time it has exceeded pre-COVID levels, to a record number of Pittsburghers travelling through PIT, with over 9.7 million travellers recorded to have started or ended their trips in Pittsburgh last year.

It’s the highest origin-and-destination (O&D) figure in the airport’s history. What’s more, PIT’s international traffic surpassed 195,000 international passengers in 2024, a 30% increase from 2023, boosted by Icelandair launching seasonal service to Reykjavik, Iceland, in May and British Airways’ continued growth on its year-round service to London Heathrow.

And international travel in Pittsburgh is expected to grow again in 2025 as British Airways will upgrade frequency to London Heathrow to a daily service starting March 30, and Icelandair will resume its seasonal Reykjavik service a month earlier in 2025, with flights returning on April 17.

“Pittsburgh is a market that responds to the air service that comes in and gives it the passenger numbers that it needs, so we are constantly adding destinations or increasing frequency or aircraft capacity on existing ones,” enthuses Cassotis.

“When I got here, I looked at the map of destinations served from Pittsburgh and thought, wow, the West Coast is missing! That’s no longer the case today.”

In terms of the overall traffic, PIT’s increasingly diverse mix of domestic routes shows that the top airlines at the airport in terms of market share are Southwest (26%) and American Airlines (24%) – the former accommodating the most passengers and the latter the most daily flights – followed by Delta (18%); United (14%); and Spirit (12%).

When we last spoke in early 2016, Cassotis mentioned that she hoped that in five to ten years PIT would see the return of international flights to Europe and the introduction of a Gulf carrier to serve the Gulf region and beyond.

BA and Icelandair have, of course, now ticked the Europe box, but Cassotis is not overly celebrating as she feels that there is scope for more services, mentioning Germany and Amsterdam in the Netherlands as potential new routes. She is, however, still looking for a Gulf carrier.

Cassotis says: “I have not given up on a Gulf carrier as we believe that we can support traffic to the region because of our Indian market and the cargo potential of the route. As you know, it often takes years for a new route to happen, and we are playing the long game.”

Innovation and new technology

When talking about innovation and ‘smart airports’, Cassotis is quick to point out that it is about more than just technology, encompassing everything from inspiring new retail/F&B offerings and route development to the opening of a childcare centre for airport staff.

“Innovation certainly isn’t always tied to technology,” she notes. “In my opinion, the definition of innovation means doing something better than before, that it makes sense, and everybody benefits from it.”

Having said that, new technology that will aid airport operations as well as passenger journeys is certainly high on the agenda for PIT, which is perhaps not surprising considering Pittsburgh’s status as a technology centre and the robot capital of the world.

Indeed, Google, Bosch, Meta, Uber (driverless car testing), Intel and Yahoo are among thousands of technology firms based in the area and the city is home to 68 colleges and universities that include R&D leaders Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.

For its part, PIT has helped bring some 30 technologies to an advanced stage at its xBridge innovation centre, located in a 10,000 square foot facility at the end of Concourse B.

One of these technologies is BioFlyte, a bio-aerosol surveillance sensor that can quickly detect and identify airborne pathogens and subsequently bio-terrorism threats such as ricin, anthrax and fentanyl in the air in less than five minutes.

One of these technologies is BioFlyte, a bio-aerosol surveillance sensor that can quickly detect and identify airborne pathogens and subsequently bio-terrorism threats such as ricin, anthrax and fentanyl in the air in less than five minutes.

During its proof of concept at PIT, Bioflyte’s BioTOF z200 sensor was installed in an HVAC mechanical room where it collected data on return air from the terminal. Additionally, BioFlyte tested simulations of threats at PIT to prove that the sensor can detect them.

It is currently deployed with the US Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, and a Fortune 100 investment banking firm.

Other innovations include tested at PIT via xBridge include smart recycling bins (CleanRobotics’ TrashBot), autonomous wheelchairs (Blueberry Technology Inc’s BBGo), the technology to convert regular vehicles into remote controlled cars (Mapless AI), and autonomous robots used to clean floor (Carnegie Robotics) or deliver food and beverages to passengers (Ottonomy’s Ottobot).

Through xBridge the airport has a partnership with British Airways’ parent company IAG to assist it in some of the work and testing it is doing in the field of robotics.

While one of the more unusual successes of xBridge has been AlgenAir’s aerium, which harnesses the natural power of algae to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) and produce oxygen (O2), combating indoor air pollution. Its first commercial-sized aerium currently sits in the baggage hall at PIT and has proved a welcome distraction for passengers waiting for their luggage.

PIT notes that the broad airport ecosystem enables innovations across many industries such as parking, logistics, retail, food and beverage, customer experience, security, sustainability, building management and more.

Talking specifically about xBridge, Cassotis says that it is “designed to embed innovation inside the airport, among its staff, companies and industry partners while maintaining a sense of Pittsburgh”.

Explaining a little more, she comments: “xBridge is a physical centre for innovation to test two things – materials, such as the paint on columns and flooring, and technology.

“On the technology side, instead of going to the robotics, AI and automation community here in Pittsburgh to say can you fix this, we have folks from xBridge who go into the start-up or robotics communities and ask them whether they’ve ever thought about using their technology in an airport. We then invite them to come to PIT and see what it can do.”

Away from technology, Cassotis believes that PIT’s sensory room and more recent opening of childcare centre for the children of airport staff are two of the most high profile ways that the airport has shown innovation in other areas.

The 1,500ft and now much copied sensory room, Presley’s Place, recently enjoyed its fifth anniversary, with Cassotis noting that it was actually the idea of PIT employee, Jason Rudge, who has an autistic son (Presley).

While the late 2023 opening of PIT’s very own childcare centre has arguably helped PIT hold on to staff and attract others to work at the airport who otherwise wouldn’t have considered it due to child care concerns.

PIT believes that providing a childcare option on the same site as an employee’s workplace helps strengthen parents’ work-life balance and supports workforce development. The goal, it says, is to break down barriers preventing working parents from starting careers at the airport.

Speaking at the facility’s opening, Cassotis said: “Being a working parent and dealing with childcare issues is huge stress. This is our contribution to getting more and more working parents, more and more peace of mind, as they build careers and build families.”

Forward looking, innovative, not afraid to embrace ‘out of the box thinking’, and determined to provide the best facilities it can for both passengers and staff, it can only be Pittsburgh International Airport.",https://airport-world.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/wawegaawg-1-394x218.jpeg,N,,2025-04-09 11:56:51.675238

Industry leaders gathered to discuss pioneering technologies, including Open Fan engine architecture, which could revolutionise fuel efficiency and emissions reductions.

During the Summit’s Pioneering Technology for Future Aircraft session, Mohamed Ali, senior vice president and chief technology and operations officer at GE Aerospace, joined Frank Haselbach, senior vice president of propulsion engineering at Airbus, to explore the potential impact of Open Fan technology.

Ali highlighted the aviation industry's steady progress in engine efficiency over the decades. “If you reflect on it, our current newest engine at CFM, the CFM LEAP, is 15% better in fuel burn than its iconic predecessor, the CFM56 engine. And then the CFM56 on its own has been 15% to 20% better than its predecessor,” he said.

Despite these gains, the fundamental shape of commercial jet engines has remained relatively unchanged. As Haselbach pointed out, the industry faces a pivotal choice – either continue refining high-bypass-ratio ducted engines or pursue a bolder, more revolutionary approach: Open Fan architecture.

Open Fan technology removes the traditional engine casing, boosting bypass ratios and significantly improving efficiency. CFM International, a joint venture between GE Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines, is spearheading Open Fan development through its Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) programme, aiming for a 20% improvement in fuel burn compared to current commercial engines.

Beyond its efficiency gains, Open Fan is designed to operate with alternative fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and hybrid electric systems, further supporting aviation's drive towards sustainability.

The RISE programme has completed over 250 critical field tests, including extensive wind tunnel evaluations. “These supercomputers’ capabilities are unprecedented in the ability to simulate the future,” Ali said, praising computational modelling used in collaboration with Boeing, NASA, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

Further tests continue, ensuring durability, vibration resistance, and alternative fuel compatibility. Airbus and CFM plan a joint demonstration flight later this decade, marking a significant step towards Open Fan’s commercial viability.",https://www.aero-mag.com/image-assets/1016e2de4a45355509923810b450038d.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 05:56:25.933612

No longer limited to futuristic imaginations, it is actively changing society, and bringing with it great opportunities to better address tomorrow’s global challenges.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has brought fundamental changes to how data is processed and analysed. Its speed and efficiency means using it can bring improvements to every industry. At Airbus, AI is not a new phenomenon – it's already being used internally to improve production, manufacturing and operational processes. It is also used in the software of some of our products, improving operational performance and safety.

A key area where AI has played a huge role at Airbus is in Earth observation. Airbus provides a range of satellite imagery services that help customers respond more effectively to natural disasters, monitor environmental changes such as deforestation, and maximise farming yields and fertilisation. AI improves these services as it enables data to be processed at incredible speeds, while leveraging machine-learning to fill in gaps in information and predict results. This enables real-time monitoring that would be impossible to do manually. It also enhances precision, reducing the likelihood of error.

AI is able to automate things like pattern recognition and predictive analysis, allowing it to detect anomalies immediately and without human oversight. These anomalies can then immediately be flagged for customers, allowing them to respond swiftly to emergencies or irregular changes, improving their decision-making capabilities and resource allocation. The AI is also powerful enough to run many algorithms in tandem, permitting it to scan for any need to activate a range of different emergency protocols.This results in a faster, more focused response.

In practical terms, there are several primary ways that AI-powered services improve satellite imagery results for our customers. Take a look at just a few of the highlights below.

Enhancing satellite imagery for better wildfire management

Climate change has made some environments around the world warmer and drier, which has increased both the frequency and burn area of wildfires. When it comes to firefighting, the ability to quickly detect, assess and respond to wildfires in real time is paramount. Pléiades Neo, Airbus’ Earth observation satellite constellation, provides key support to those fighting fires on the ground. Its high-resolution imagery of wildfires greatly enhances situational awareness for firefighters, allowing them to track the evolution of fires, predict their spread and identify safe evacuation routes. Its data can also be combined with that of other satellites to have a larger view of a situation at lower resolution.

The Pléiades Neo imagery is provided in 30 centimetre resolution, meaning one pixel of an image represents a 30 x 30 centimetre square of the planet. The utility of this extremely high-resolution imagery is taken a step further by the AI-powered software that is able to identify tiny changes and flag them for review. This allows our customers to react to new threats as quickly as possible, without waiting for them to become large enough to be detected by the naked eye.

Tracking deforestation from space

Deforestation is a significant contributor to climate change, and the supply chains of certain commodities – including palm oil, coffee, cocoa, rubber, pulp and paper, timber and soy – are known to be at risk of supporting illegal deforestation. Starling is a software programme founded by Airbus and the Earthworm Foundation to help companies combat deforestation and meet their responsible sourcing requirements.

Starling analyses high-resolution imagery from ESA’s Sentinel-2, NASA’s Landsat and Airbus’ Pléiades Neo satellite systems, and uses AI-powered algorithms to detect suspicious changes in forest cover and identify illegal deforestation. This is especially important as some, though not all, deforestation takes place in very remote areas far from human sight. Being able to identify damage in real time helps local law enforcement enforce policies against illegal logging as quickly as possible, supporting biodiversity and responsible land use.

Increasing harvest quality and yields

Farmstar is another Airbus product that uses AI-powered algorithms to improve farming productivity and yields for wheat, barley and rapeseed crops. Vegetation reflects sunlight differently depending on its development, which can be discerned in satellite imagery. This information is then processed by algorithms and combined with meteorological data to provide advice about soil conditions, crop health and environmental factors. These recommendations can then be used to help optimise farming practices, leading to increased yields and crop quality.

Farmstar supports precision fertilisation by tracking nitrogen levels. Its algorithm can then recommend where to add more fertiliser and where to withhold it. This is called automatic variable rate application, and it saves money for the farmer and reduces the amount of fertiliser used, reducing its environmental impact.

Farmstar can also support the growth of sustainable aviation fuels. It can optimise the yield of the crops used for SAF production, and find the right balance between crops to feed populations, crops to produce SAF and intermediate crops to absorb carbon emissions.",https://mediaassets.airbus.com/medias/domain38/media102215/664640-y5ld0j4c65-preview.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 05:56:44.755206

The government said Nigeria was in full alignment with the project by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) on “Leave no Country Behind”, and was fully carried along by developed countries in the transition processes.

But it lamented the cost implications of transitioning into the Greener Aviation industry.

Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Festus Keyamo, made the disclosures when he received members of the House Committee on Aviation at the Ministry of Aviation and Aerospace Development headquarters, Abuja.

While pointing out that Nigeria accounted for only 2.5 per cent of global CO₂emissions as of 2015, Keyamo said, “As a Third World country, we face major limitations in investing in infrastructure and research for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), even though it is part of our mandate.

“Most developed countries have made limited progress in producing SAF due to lack of market demand and most aircraft are still manufactured to run on fossil fuels. It would be very expensive to modify existing aircraft engines to be compatible with SAF.”

The aviation minister explained that the sector’s agencies were working assiduously on initiatives to mitigate the effect of climate change.

Keyamo said some of the initiatives included production of Seasonal Climate Prediction by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet) and participation in Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) programme by the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN).

As a result, the carbon footprint for Lagos airport was reduced by six per cent in 2021 due to improved energy management, earning the airport a Level 2 ACA accreditation (Reduction), he stated.

Keyamo added that the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) was actively addressing climate change through initiatives, like the “Fly2Green Nigeria” programme to promote Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and collaborate with the National Council on Climate Change (NCCC) to facilitate cleaner aviation energy.

Chairman, House Committee on Climate Change, Honourable Chris Nkwonta, emphasised the financial burden of transitioning to greener aviation.

Nkwonta said the committee had discussed that with the United Nations, stressing the need for international support to help developing nations meet climate change targets.

He also stressed the need for conscious steps to decarbonise the sector as much as possible through the innovative use of less emitting fuels and carbon trade-offs; green infrastructure at the airports; sustainable waste management practices, among others.

Nkwonta called on airlines to invest in buying carbon credits to offset their carbon footprints, saying the funds from there can then be used to invest in more sustainable energy sources for the country and even in climate-smart agricultural practices that can help address food security issues.

The facility is expected to produce up to 96 million litres of SAF annually which will be supplied to nearby airports. Early modelling indicates a potential lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction of 70% compared to conventional jet fuel.

The project, currently in pre-final investment decision stage, aims to deliver SAF from early 2029.

Renewable Developments Australia’s Managing Director, Tony D’Alessandro, said the partnership with Virgin Australia and Qatar Airways marks a significant milestone in the development of a sustainable aviation fuel industry in Australia.

He said: “We are proud to be working with two globally recognised airlines that share our vision of creating a domestic supply of SAF. This project is designed to deliver real, long-term emission reductions while building a new industry in regional Queensland.

“Our EtJ SAF facility in the Charters Towers Region will be a fully integrated production site, generating sustainable fuel from bioethanol derived from locally grown sugarcane. Additionally, by repurposing by-products of the SAF production process to generate renewable power onsite, we are setting a new benchmark for sustainability in aviation fuel manufacturing.

“This initiative is more than just a step towards decarbonising air travel; it represents a major investment in Australia’s energy security and regional economic development.”",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Virgin-Australia-and-Qatar-pic-Biofuel-9-4-768x512.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 03:56:15.163912

🔌 PluggedIn: How Symphonic Capital is setting up pre-seed founders for success (video)

Sydney Thomas was working for an early stage venture capital firm when she noticed that some of the firm’s portfolio companies from unconventional backgrounds would get “lost in the sauce” when they went to raise follow-on rounds from investors. That led her to launch Symphonic Capital with former entrepreneur and Y Combinator alum Shruti Shah. The pre-seed venture firm invests in founders building solutions for underserved communities. “The thesis was, how are we investing in companies that are closing access gaps around health and wealth for overlooked communities?” Thomas told Sherrell Dorsey on this week’s PluggedIn. “A consistent theme that we saw was that climate intersects with both of these.”

Digital supply chain solutions can transform compliance challenges into a strategic advantage, helping brands build trust, enhance operational efficiency, and drive long-term profitability.","From global icons to mid-size businesses, today’s fashion and apparel brands are facing pressure to meet increasingly stringent environmental, social, and governance (ESG) requirements. Between the growing scrutiny from consumers to the watchful eyes of investors and regulators, the stakes have never been higher for companies to ensure ethical sourcing, environmental responsibility, and supply chain transparency.

With these challenges, however, comes opportunity: digital supply chain solutions are emerging as critical tools for mitigating ESG risks, maintaining compliance, and turning sustainability obstacles into competitive advantage.

Rising pressures: The ESG imperative in fashion supply chains

Under growing scrutiny from regulators and stakeholders, fashion brands face intensifying pressure to transform their operations and ensure full transparency in their supply chains.

Violations in environmental standards or an infringement of worker rights can quickly escalate into a reputational crisis, particularly when issues arise deep within supply chains. That said, gaining visibility into these areas continues to be a formidable challenge due to the fragmented nature of global supply chains and disconnected data systems.

For example, brands often struggle to track materials and processes across multiple geographies and supply chain layers. Without reliable insights, companies may be susceptible to serious losses due to supply chain disruptions. They also risk non-compliance with ESG mandates, financial penalties, and diminished consumer trust.

Challenges in capturing accurate ESG data

The challenges of ESG compliance often stem from fragmented systems and data silos, creating significant obstacles for companies striving to achieve transparency and accountability.

Fragmentation occurs when different systems are used to track disparate data points, such as materials, processes, facilities, and their social or environmental impacts. This disjointed approach makes it difficult to consolidate information into a unified framework.

Compounding this issue, data silos frequently arise when product-specific data is isolated from facility-level sustainability metrics. This isolation hampers the ability to generate comprehensive and accurate reports.

Regulatory uncertainty adds yet another layer of complexity. The rapidly evolving landscape demands that companies comply across all tiers of their supply chains, yet many lack the necessary tools to effectively capture and organize the required data.

This lack of centralized data and reporting practices only exacerbates these challenges, leaving brands unprepared to meet both current and future mandates.

Digital innovation for tackling ESG hurdles

An important first step is to adopt a digital supply chain platform and framework to ensure you can collect, interpret, and report on the data required. Digital supply chain solutions for fashion and apparel brands offer game-changing potential for addressing the above challenges head-on, providing the necessary tools to build transparent, compliant, and sustainable supply chains.

For example, real-time supply chain tracking that utilizes IoT sensors and AI-driven analytics can enhance visibility into every layer of the supply chain. These tools allow brands to closely monitor material origins, labor practices, and environmental impacts, ensuring a deeper understanding of supply chain dynamics.

Additionally, automated compliance management can play a crucial role in streamlining processes. With digital audit trails, supplier self-assessments, and AI-based risk assessments, brands can minimize human error and ensure adherence to regulatory requirements.

Data unification and interoperability can further address ESG challenges by enabling the consolidation of data from multiple sources into flexible, cloud-based systems. This capability allows for dynamic reporting and analysis, making it easier for brands to respond to evolving regulations.

Finally, AI-powered tools can also add an important layer of value by predicting potential ESG supply chain risks (financial or otherwise) and providing actionable insights to address issues before they escalate into full-blown reputational crises.

Future-proofing ESG: Flexible solutions for success

As regulations evolve, brands must adapt to meet both immediate and long-term ESG requirements. A dual approach can help.

In the short-term, it’s important to align with existing voluntary frameworks to help ensure compliance. These include the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which provides standards for sustainability reporting, and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), which focuses on financially material ESG disclosures.

Longer term, brands should consider implementing modular, adaptable systems that can evolve alongside future regulatory changes and market demands.

Collaboration across the supply chain is equally important. Brands need to engage suppliers at all tiers, leveraging digital tools to simplify data collection and ensure accurate, consistent reporting. This not only strengthens compliance but also fosters stronger partnerships and operational efficiencies.

The path forward: Turning ESG challenges into strategic wins

Rather than looking at ESG compliance as a burden, brands should lean into it as an opportunity to differentiate themselves in a crowded market. Digital supply chain solutions can transform compliance challenges into a strategic advantage, helping brands build trust, enhance operational efficiency, and drive long-term profitability.

The future of fashion and apparel supply chains lies in digitization, transparency, and sustainability. By taking these steps today, companies can seamlessly navigate the challenges of ESG compliance and lead the way toward a more ethical and sustainable future.",https://img.sdcexec.com/files/base/acbm/scn/image/2025/03/Generative_ART_AdobeStock_618444171.67c36055d827d.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-04-09 01:56:20.960019

Though aviation doesn’t account for a large portion of emissions, the increase in use of aviation globally has created a demand for sustainable aviation.
Aviation companies tend to mix bio fuels, hydrogen, and batteries, which are only viable for short flights.
Accountability has also created a barrier for the use of Sustainable Aviation, as there are no yet verdicts on large suits against Aviation Companies for unsustainable practices.
Without clear mandates or widespread market incentives, aviation companies have little reason to adopt these cleaner alternatives.","EcoAero had the opportunity to meet with Ethan Elkind, the director of the Climate Program at UC Berkeley Law School center for Law, Energy and the Environment. Mr. Elkind has recently started his research on law and energy use specifically in the aviation industry, as seen in his “Clean Take Off” Publication. He has started answering the questions of what legal tools does California use to require the use of sustainable aviation fuel and the incentives being put to use. The question of E-fuels, the combination of zero emission hydrogen with carbon capture, in aviation was a large part of Mr. Elkind’s Research as it looks to be a promising way to create a carbon neutral synthetic fossil fuel.

The Carbon Footprint of aviation is relatively small, about 2% globally and state wide. Though aviation doesn’t account for a large portion of emissions, the increase in use of aviation globally has created a demand for sustainable aviation. Contrails, the result of aviation, can magnify the effects of Greenhouse gasses. There is no ready, universal solution to limit the use of fossil fuels in aviation. Aviation companies tend to mix bio fuels, hydrogen, and batteries, which are only viable for short flights. The laws and policies on sustainable aviation are limited at this point and current solutions are just not enough so companies are looking towards solutions such as e-fuels.

It is not yet clear as to the economic value of e-fuels. E-fuel is essentially a synthetic petroleum molecule, carbon neutral with very limited emissions. In order for e-fuels to have a chance of success in the current market it would have to be cost competitive with other fuel sources such as jet fuel. The hydrogen and carbon capture required is extremely expensive and if there is excess wind or solar power, it would be more economical to store it for other uses. There is also no demand in the market right now thus companies have no incentive to spend four times the amount of money on sustainable fuel when it is not yet required by any law.

As for the legalities, there are no clear cut mandates for aviation companies to change the sustainability of their fuel and incentives are the only thing pushing the use of sustainable Aviation. The Federal Government has already stepped in the field and passed a series of laws, mostly in the 1970s, such as the Airline Deregulation Act which created a national market for Aviation in which states have no control over. The question remains, if California continues to challenge the use of sustainably in Aviation, will it be challenged and invalidated by Federal law?

Accountability has also created a barrier for the use of Sustainable Aviation, as there are no yet verdicts on large suits against Aviation Companies for unsustainable practices. Companies need to be held accountable in order for progress to be made in the field and it might take multiple decades for these suites to come to a final judgement. It is not clear yet where the money from the suits would be distributed if the cases were to render a guilty verdict.

The best way to fight the cost issue, Mr. Elkind states, is to get as much deployment as possible to bring the cost down over time. Reducing the cost of electrolyzers plays a huge part in this strategy.

In speaking with Ethan Elkind, we gained insight into the critical but complex intersection of aviation, sustainability, and legal policy. While the aviation sector currently contributes a relatively small portion of global emissions, its rapid growth and the amplified climate impact of byproducts like contrails make the need for sustainable alternatives increasingly urgent. Mr. Elkind’s research shines a light on promising technologies such as e-fuels — synthetic, carbon-neutral alternatives that may eventually offer viable replacements for conventional jet fuel. Yet as he made clear, significant legal, economic, and infrastructural challenges remain. Without clear mandates or widespread market incentives, aviation companies have little reason to adopt these cleaner alternatives. At EcoAero, we recognize that bridging this policy and innovation gap is essential. We will continue advocating for stronger legal frameworks and greater accountability while spotlighting emerging solutions like those Mr. Elkind studies — ensuring the path to cleaner aviation is not just imagined but actively pursued.",https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1030/1*kFtTEF7LjElWeqvKVvTFgg.jpeg,N,,2025-04-09 05:56:57.740436

A final investment decision on the company’s proposed sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project is expected by year end.

Tidewater began commercial operations at its renewable diesel and renewable hydrogen (HDRD) complex during the final quarter of 2023. The HDRD complex achieved a daily throughput of 2,677 barrels per day during the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a utilization rate of 89%, up from 1,700 barrels per day, or 57%, during the same period of 2023.

For the full year 2024, Tidewater reported that significant improvements in throughput and reliability at the HDRD complex allowed the facility to achieve an average daily throughput of 2,643 barrels per day, equating to a utilization rate of 88%. The biorefinery has produced and sold more than 170 million liters (44.91 million gallons) of renewable diesel into the local British Columbia market since the facility began operations in November 2023.

Tidewater has proposed to develop 6,500 barrels per day of SAF capacity at the Prince George biorefinery. The company said it has continued to make meaningful progress on the front-end engineering design work for the proposed SAF project and expects to make a final investment decision during the second half of 2025.

Tidewater reported a fourth quarter net loss of $3.4 million, compared to a net loss of $12.7 million during the same period of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $6 million, down 44% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.

For the full year 2024, Tidewater reported a net loss of $357.8 million, compared to a net loss of $41 million for 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $74.5 million, up 62% when compared to the previous year.

During a fourth quarter earnings call, company officials discussed policy changes and company actions that aim to improve the Canadian market for renewable diesel. Tidewater, in late 2024 filed a countervailing (anti-subsidy) and anti-dumping duty complaint with the Canada Boarder Services Agency. The complaint alleged that unfairly traded imports of renewable diesel from the U.S. were significantly undermining the Canadian industry. In response to that complaint, CBSA on March 6 announced it is initiating investigations into alleged dumping and subsidizing of renewable diesel from the U.S.

Tidewater has also spoken out in support of action taken by the government of British Columbia earlier this year to update the law governing its Low Carbon Fuels Standard. The updates will require eligible renewable fuels to be produced in Canada and boost the renewable content requirements for diesel.

The week after Tidewater issued its fourth quarter earnings release, the company announced that a minor fire occurred at the HDRD complex on April 1. According to a statement released by Tidewater, no injuries were reported and the incident appeared to cause a low level of damage.

It gives airlines’ corporate customers access to in-sector emissions reductions and capitalises on firms’ capacity to co-finance the cost of decarbonisation.
The SAF Registry is designed to be technology- and feedstock-neutral, allowing for a range of SAF production methods.
“In releasing the SAF Registry to CADO for launch, we have put in place a critical platform for the benefit of all stakeholders.
“Governments must reallocate their direct support given to fossil fuel producers in favour of renewable energy production.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has launched the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry, a global system to record SAF transactions in a standardised and transparent way.

The system allows the environmental benefits of SAF to be recorded as the fuel moves through the value chain, supporting airlines and corporate customers in claiming these benefits under regulatory frameworks and voluntary initiatives.

Now operated by the Civil Aviation Decarbonisation Organisation (CADO), the Registry aims to create a standardised, transparent marketplace for SAF – helping airlines and corporate customers prove their environmental claims and meet climate-related goals.

By supporting accurate tracking of SAF transactions worldwide, the platform aims to accelerate the sector’s transition to net-zero emissions by 2050.

The Registry helps solve the challenge of limited SAF supply – which is acutely scarce and available in a few locations globally – by connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers, regardless of their geographical location. It gives airlines’ corporate customers access to in-sector emissions reductions and capitalises on firms’ capacity to co-finance the cost of decarbonisation.

The SAF Registry is designed to be technology- and feedstock-neutral, allowing for a range of SAF production methods. It can align with specific regulatory requirements while supporting efforts toward global harmonisation. The system is intended to be interoperable with other registries to promote competition and open markets.

The Registry was developed in consultation with airlines, government authorities, OEMs, fuel producers and suppliers, and corporate travel management companies. With over 30 early users already in the process of onboarding and ready to use the system, the Registry is underpinned by the IATA SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology which provides a consistent approach to accounting for the environmental benefits of SAF purchases, regardless of location.

“Aviation’s decarbonisation is a team effort,” says Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s chief economist and SVP of sustainability. “In releasing the SAF Registry to CADO for launch, we have put in place a critical platform for the benefit of all stakeholders.

“It ensures that all airlines in the world have access to SAF and that their SAF purchases can be claimed against any climate-related obligations in this domain. The Registry will record the environmental attributes of SAF purchases in an immutable way, safeguarding against double counting.

“Airlines, their corporate customers, fuel producers, regulatory bodies, and all related organisations will be able to record and account for their SAF transactions in a global market for SAF.

“While this is of fundamental importance and a historically momentous advance, it is but one step along the way to a mature, transparent, and liquid global SAF market. The Registry cannot produce miracles on its own, but without it, no miracles can be produced.

“Further progress requires active policy support for the ramping-up of all renewable energy production, and for SAF within that production,” says Thomsen. “Governments must reallocate their direct support given to fossil fuel producers in favour of renewable energy production. The precedent of the wind and solar energy markets is the example to follow, and this without any further delay.”

The deal had two parts. First in his capacity of an adviser to the U.K. government, Carney has helped push for a new British regulation to use 10 per cent biofuel in jet planes. Second, Carney’s company Brookfield made a $1-billion investment in a biofuel company.

“Mr. Carney is not a businessman,” Poilievre said in Edmonton on Tuesday. “He is a political grifter who has used his political influence to turn decisions that profit his company at the expense of workers and seniors — and that is exactly how he would govern the country.”

Article content

Carney brought up the jet fuel deal at the Prime Quadrant conference — billed as a place to reach 400 “ultra high net worth investors” — in December 2024. At the time, Carney was both an official economic adviser to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and also chairman and head of impact investing for Brookfield.

Carney used the jet fuel deal as an example of how government policy can drive investment into net-zero businesses.

He told his interviewer that he gave free advice to politicians. “I do spend some time advising on what, you know, again, pro bono, but advising on the types of policies that are going to have maximum impacts for investors.”

He then pointed to air travel causing two per cent of global carbon emissions. “So the question is, ‘Are we going to have green, sustainable aviation fuel?’ What’s happened in the U.K., the EU, is they’ve said to major airlines, ‘Look, if you’re flying in and out of Heathrow or wherever, you have to have 10 per cent of your load, it has to be sustainable aviation fuel by 2030.'”

As a consequence of this policy, Carney said the biofuel produced by a Texas company suddenly became economic. Airline companies like American Airlines and British Airways had to purchase this more expensive fuel. “They’ll pay a green premium,” Carney said. “In that case, we put, Brookfield, put a billion dollars to work there (investing in the biofuel company). And, you know, it’s a fantastic opportunity. The point being, the policy has to drive it and drive things down.”

I asked Poilievre about this jet fuel deal. He was in Edmonton for a political rally, then took questions from the media at a Tire Town outlet, standing before a group of shop workers.

“It’s crony capitalism,” Poilievre said, “It works against these people behind me.”

He gestured at Tire Town workers, then unpacked what Carney had said and done. “In this particular case he used his political power to convince the British government to require more expensive jet fuel for air travel, and then he invested, his company invested, a billion dollars in the company that was selling that jet fuel. So, if God forbid, a family like the people behind me here want to take their kids on a vacation somewhere, they have to pay higher airplane ticket prices to fund this more expensive jet fuel so that Mark Carney’s billion-dollar investment can pay off.”

Poilievre concluded his critique. “Mark Carney has been getting rich by making the working class poor.”

Of course business leaders often lobby government leaders. But Carney’s relationship was more than lobbying, it was working closely with government on policy, sometimes as a formal adviser.

Of course Carney will say the carbon policies he pushed and/or is now still pushing — from consumer carbon taxes to biofuel mandates, from carbon emissions caps on the oil and gas industry to carbon tariffs on imported products — are hugely beneficial when it comes to dealing with global warming.

That may or may not be true. I have major doubts given how hesitant progressive left elites have been to embrace the best way to lower emissions, namely building out nuclear power and replacing coal burning with lower emissions LNG exports.

It’s also fair to ask at a time when the world’s economic tigers, from the U.S. to China to India, are producing and securing as much fossil fuel energy as they can, and when numerous top Western financial institutions are backing away from Carney’s net-zero regulatory scheme, if it’s wise for Canada to now go all-in on iffy policies that have done well for Carney and Brookfield but have driven up costs for struggling Canadian families.

CTP’s unique approach involves working closely with corporate partners to identify and support technology solutions tailored to aviation needs.

Qantas and Airbus’ collaboration with CTP will help stimulate technological advancements in SAF, particularly in Australia, through a dedicated investment vehicle. It will focus on technologies for SAF production, feedstock development and other value-chain innovations and will sit alongside Climate Tech Partner’s main fund. CTP will leverage the diverse skills and knowledge base of its group of 12 partners – made up of leaders in industries ranging from energy generation to infrastructure – to provide mentorship and strategic guidance to enable further collaboration.

This initiative will help bridge the gap that Qantas and Airbus have identified between early-stage climate technologies and at-scale commercial production in Australia. Through this partnership, CTP will invest on behalf of Qantas and Airbus into leading local and global start-ups focused on SAF and other innovative technologies. As these solutions mature, Qantas and Airbus have the option to explore further follow-on and direct investments enabling deployment of the start-up’s technologies in real-world Australian projects. The investment will be made from Qantas and Airbus’ US$200 million partnership which was established in 2022 to help accelerate SAF production.

Airbus Chief Sustainability Officer Julie Kitcher said: “Decarbonising aviation at speed and scale requires bold action and collaboration across sectors – from airlines, manufacturers and airports to regulators, governments and investors. This partnership with CTP and Qantas highlights that the scaling of Sustainable Aviation Fuel needs innovative solutions for a nascent technology that will drive innovation, attract investment and create new jobs in Australia, which I believe is well positioned to be a leader in low carbon fuels. At Airbus, we are honoured to be partnering with Qantas and now CTP to transform aviation for the long term.”

Qantas Group Chief Sustainability Officer Fiona Messent said: “Sustainable aviation fuel is the most effective tool we have to decarbonise aviation and, with Airbus, we’re investing significantly in ways to make it more available and accessible. As well as funding, this partnership will help provide a vote of confidence in new technologies so they can be developed, scaled and integrated in the SAF supply chain, while also providing companies with access to Qantas and Airbus as they develop and test their solutions. For Australia, an onshore SAF industry will mean improved national fuel security, more jobs and economic benefit, so it’s fantastic to be collaborating across industries to help accelerate local production.”

Patrick Sieb, Co-Founder, CTP said: “Working with global leading aviation and aerospace companies allows us to not only make more deeply informed investment decisions in this complex area but attract and support the best companies by helping them accelerate through industry engagement.”

Climate Tech Partners specialises in investing in globally scalable technology solutions, primarily at the Series A stage, across the Energy & Power, Transport & Logistics, and Industrials & Resources sectors.

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel market is now ready for takeoff—wiser, tougher, and more determined than ever.","Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is widely recognized as a cornerstone in reducing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint. With global carbon neutrality goals intensifying, SAF has drawn increasing support from regulators, airlines, and investors. The path to scaling SAF has faced major roadblocks, none more significant than the economic ripple effects of the Trump-era trade war.

The trade conflict, characterized by aggressive tariff regimes aimed at key international partners such as China and the EU, affected nearly every major industry, and SAF was no exception. From feedstock pricing volatility to industrial equipment shortages, the impact on SAF development was substantial. This article explores how the Trump administration’s trade war shaped the SAF market, caused policy shifts, altered global competitiveness, and spurred new innovations amid the chaos.

How Trump’s Tariffs Altered the SAF Supply Chain

Sustainable Aviation Fuel relies on a complex international supply chain involving feedstocks like soybean oil, used cooking oil, animal fats, and agricultural waste. Many of these are processed using imported equipment and technologies, particularly from Europe and Asia. The tariffs imposed on aluminum, steel, and high-tech machinery led to higher costs for infrastructure development. Simultaneously, tariffs on agricultural imports and exports destabilized feedstock sourcing.

The result was that SAF producers faced higher capital costs, unpredictable feedstock pricing, and regulatory uncertainty. Infrastructure build-outs slowed, research investments contracted, and airlines hesitated to commit to SAF procurement due to unstable supply and inflated prices.

SAF Cost Volatility and Investment Withdrawal

The early-stage nature of SAF commercialization meant the industry was particularly vulnerable to price shocks. With production already more expensive than conventional jet fuel, additional costs from tariffs made SAF an even tougher sell. Airlines that had pledged to reduce their carbon emissions by integrating SAF into their fuel mix were forced to delay or renegotiate contracts.

Venture capital and private equity investments in biofuel startups also saw a decline during the peak years of the trade war. The uncertainty over equipment tariffs and export restrictions created risk factors that discouraged funding. As a result, many SAF projects either scaled back or stalled entirely.

Agricultural Sector Instability and Feedstock Scarcity

A major, often overlooked aspect of the trade war was its impact on U.S. agriculture. China’s retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybeans, corn, and other crops disrupted export flows, leading to domestic surpluses and price crashes. While this initially appeared beneficial for SAF producers relying on these feedstocks, the long-term result was lower crop yields, a shift in farmer priorities, and reduced agricultural resilience.

This feedstock uncertainty undermined planning for long-term SAF contracts, complicating the economic modeling needed for large-scale facility investments. Tariffs on imported feedstocks from countries like Argentina and Brazil further limited options for producers.

Policy Paralysis and Regulatory Delay

The Trump administration focused heavily on deregulation and promoting fossil fuels, often at the expense of renewable energy programs. SAF, still an emerging technology at the time, received limited direct support. Without robust federal incentives or a clear regulatory framework, SAF producers were left navigating a high-cost environment without a clear pathway to scale.

This policy vacuum delayed progress on SAF mandates, blending requirements, and infrastructure funding. By contrast, the European Union advanced its SAF roadmap through mandates like ReFuelEU, widening the transatlantic gap in sustainable aviation readiness.

International Competition and Global Market Shifts

While U.S. companies struggled under the weight of protectionist trade policies, international competitors accelerated SAF production. Finland, the Netherlands, Singapore, and the UK leveraged government support and favorable trade policies to attract investment and build SAF refining capacity.

As a result, Europe and Asia-Pacific began exporting SAF to global carriers, securing long-term contracts with international airlines. U.S.-based producers, constrained by tariffs and lacking scale, missed out on these early opportunities. This shift not only reduced U.S. market share but also signaled a broader decline in American leadership in green aviation technology.

The Turnaround: Post-Tariff Recovery and Strategic Resilience

Since the end of Trump’s presidency, the Biden administration has sought to reverse many of the economic barriers faced by the SAF industry. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 included significant tax credits and incentives for low-carbon fuel production. These measures helped rejuvenate investor interest and sparked new SAF initiatives across the U.S.

In response to past supply chain disruptions, SAF companies are now prioritizing domestic resilience. Many have started to localize supply chains, develop non-agricultural feedstock alternatives like municipal solid waste and algae, and integrate vertically to minimize reliance on foreign equipment.

Lessons Learned: Balancing Trade, Security, and Climate

The Trump-era trade policies served as a wake-up call for the SAF sector. While the intention was to boost domestic industries, the ripple effects proved that trade isolation can hinder innovation, disrupt green goals, and weaken global competitiveness.

Policymakers today must strike a balance between protecting national interests and fostering international collaboration. SAF, by its nature, is a globally interconnected industry. Harmonizing regulatory standards, facilitating cross-border tech transfer, and maintaining open supply chains will be essential for its success.

A Stronger, Smarter SAF Industry Ahead

Despite the setbacks of the Trump-era tariffs, the SAF market has demonstrated remarkable resilience. What once seemed like insurmountable challenges have sparked innovation, localization, and strategic partnerships. The U.S. may have lost ground temporarily, but the lessons learned have laid the foundation for a more self-sufficient, stable, and forward-thinking SAF industry.

With continued policy support, investment, and international alignment, SAF will remain a critical pillar of sustainable aviation. The turbulence of the trade war has passed, but its legacy will inform the next generation of clean fuel strategies and supply chain design.

Nigeria’s Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Mr Festus Keyamo, said on Tuesday that the federal government is investing in sustainable aviation infrastructure. He spoke during a visit from the House Committee on Aviation at his Abuja office.

Keyamo stressed the need to cut the aviation industry’s carbon footprint. He noted Nigeria’s alignment with the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO) “Leave No Country Behind” project, ensuring the country keeps pace with developed nations in this shift.

Though Nigeria contributed just 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions in 2015, Keyamo highlighted challenges. “As a third-world country, we face major limitations in investing in infrastructure and research for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), even though it is part of our mandate,” he said.

He added that developed countries also struggle with SAF production due to low demand, and most aircraft still rely on fossil fuels. “It would be very expensive to modify existing aircraft engines to be compatible with SAF,” he explained.

He praised ongoing efforts. “All the aviation agencies are working assiduously on initiatives to mitigate the impact of climate change,” Keyamo said. These include the Nigerian Meteorological Agency’s (NiMet) Seasonal Climate Predictions and the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria’s (FAAN) Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) programme.

“As a result of this, the carbon footprint for Lagos airport was reduced by 6% in 2021 due to improved energy management, earning the airport a Level 2 ACA accreditation (Reduction),” he added.

Hon Chris Nkwonta, Chairman of the House Committee on Climate Change, raised funding concerns.

As business aviation operators strive for greater sustainability while maintaining operational efficiency, the complexity of evolving regulations presents both challenges and opportunities. To navigate this rapidly changing landscape, digitalization is emerging as a crucial tool for ensuring compliance and boosting operational efficiency.

New Sustainability Regulations for 2025

Several significant regulatory changes have come into effect in 2025, shaping the future of sustainability in business aviation. In the UK, the government implemented its Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate on January 1, requiring all jet fuel supplied in the country to contain at least 2% SAF. While this marks a significant step in reducing fossil fuel emissions, it also creates financial challenges for operators. Aircraft owners and charter companies will need to invest in SAF at a higher cost while waiting for production scales to increase, creating an opportunity for technology to alleviate these financial pressures.

In Europe, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has introduced mandates for emissions tracking and transparency. The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), effective from January 1, 2025, requires reporting on non-CO₂ emissions. Additionally, the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) will be mandatory starting in 2026. These measures call for business aviation operators to invest in emissions tracking systems and enhance their reporting capabilities to meet these new environmental standards.

In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has adopted new regulations for companies to disclose their environmental footprint, including Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Corporate flight departments and aircraft managers will need to implement systems that track emissions accurately. These disclosures will start in 2026, covering Fiscal Year 2025. Additionally, the U.S. has introduced the Clean Fuel Production Credit (CFPC), incentivizing SAF production based on emission reductions, which could make SAF more cost-effective and widely available for business aviation operators over time.

The Need for Digital Solutions in Business Aviation

As regulatory requirements continue to evolve, business aviation companies must stay agile. Digitalization is playing a pivotal role in managing these complexities, especially with the increasing need for emissions tracking and environmental reporting.

Introducing digital document management systems can streamline compliance with evolving regulations. Traditional paper-based systems can overwhelm operators with hundreds of pages of data, making it difficult to stay up to date. A digital solution consolidates all information into one accessible platform, automatically updating regulatory changes and flagging necessary actions for operators.

The use of large language models (LLM) in aviation documentation further enhances efficiency. With AI, users can easily query and receive detailed explanations about new regulations, saving valuable time spent searching for relevant information and improving compliance.

We examine the economic ripple effects, challenges faced by stakeholders, evolving policy landscapes, and what the future holds for SAF in a post-tariff world. By analyzing multiple angles—feedstock supply chains, global competition, investment climates, and policy shifts—we provide a holistic view of the intersection between trade policy and sustainable innovation.

How Trump-Era Tariffs Are Reshaping the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market

The Trump administration’s aggressive tariff strategy—aimed at rebalancing trade deficits and protecting domestic industries—had unintended consequences for the renewable energy sector. Sustainable Aviation Fuel, which depends on a complex network of global supply chains, was particularly vulnerable.

Tariffs on aluminum, steel, and industrial machinery increased the cost of building and operating SAF production facilities. Even more critically, tariffs on agricultural products disrupted feedstock supply chains. Corn, soybeans, and used cooking oil—common SAF feedstocks—saw pricing volatility that discouraged producers from scaling operations. Import restrictions also made it harder for U.S. companies to access advanced refining equipment and bioconversion technologies developed in Europe and Asia.

The uncertainty surrounding ongoing trade negotiations made investors hesitant. Many feared that new policies could make foreign partnerships less viable or affect raw material availability, leading to project delays or cancellations.

The Trump Trade War and Its Lasting Impact on Sustainable Aviation Fuel Development

The impact of the Trump-era trade war has extended well beyond the immediate economic shockwaves. While some sectors have since recovered, the SAF market continues to feel the long-term effects of disrupted growth.

Many SAF producers were in nascent stages of development during the tariff period. The sudden increase in capital expenditure due to tariffs and counter-tariffs on machinery, chemical catalysts, and feedstock materials deterred early adopters. Several joint ventures between U.S. firms and European partners were either paused or restructured, reflecting a new level of geopolitical risk factored into sustainability strategies.

These delays pushed back SAF certification efforts, slowed down commercialization timelines, and reduced the confidence of airline operators who were eager to secure green fuel contracts. As a result, the U.S. lagged behind Europe in SAF readiness, even as global mandates like CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) loomed on the horizon.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel in a Post-Tariff World: Lessons from the Trump Trade War

As the dust begins to settle from the trade war, stakeholders across the SAF value chain are applying hard-earned lessons. Chief among them is the importance of diversification—not only of feedstock types but also of supply sources and geopolitical risk exposure.

Many producers have begun sourcing feedstocks domestically to avoid future tariff exposure, which in turn is reviving interest in U.S. agriculture-based fuel solutions. There is also a renewed emphasis on vertical integration, where companies aim to control both feedstock supply and fuel refining processes to buffer against international disruptions.

Innovation in SAF technology has accelerated in part due to this shift. Emerging feedstocks such as municipal solid waste, algae, and forest residues are gaining traction, as they offer less exposure to trade volatility and fewer conflicts with food supply chains. Furthermore, domestic collaborations are being prioritized over international joint ventures, reflecting a cautious shift in partnership strategy.

Can the U.S. Achieve Energy Independence in SAF Amid Trade Barriers?

One of the unexpected outcomes of the Trump administration’s protectionist policies was a renewed call for energy independence—not just in fossil fuels, but also in renewable alternatives. For the SAF sector, this raises an intriguing question: Can the U.S. truly produce enough sustainable aviation fuel domestically to meet future demand?

The short answer is: not yet, but it’s within reach. The U.S. has vast agricultural resources that can be leveraged for SAF production. Scaling production will require investment in biorefineries, government subsidies, and a coordinated policy framework. Programs like the Inflation Reduction Act and the Department of Energy’s SAF Grand Challenge have stepped in to bridge this gap.

Still, challenges remain. Building a fully domestic SAF ecosystem requires overcoming logistical hurdles, technological scaling, and regulatory compliance. Without international collaboration—particularly in technology exchange and best practices—the U.S. risks siloing its SAF development, which may limit innovation and delay decarbonization goals.

From Soybeans to SAF: How Tariffs on Agricultural Products Disrupted Biofuel Supply Chains

The Trump tariffs notably targeted agricultural exports and imports, particularly from China. Soybeans, one of the most important feedstocks for biofuel, were caught in the crossfire. As China retaliated with its own tariffs, American soybean farmers faced surplus inventories and falling prices.

While this initially seemed beneficial for domestic SAF producers—lower prices meant cheaper feedstock—the longer-term impact was more damaging. Farmers shifted away from soybean cultivation, disrupting future supply reliability. The uncertainty discouraged long-term contracts, a crucial element for SAF production planning.

Other feedstocks like corn stover and used cooking oil also faced price fluctuations due to altered trade dynamics. This volatility made it difficult for SAF producers to establish stable supply chains, impacting both pricing models and production timelines.

The Cost of Going Green: Economic Burden of Trump Tariffs on the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Sector

Producing SAF is already more expensive than traditional jet fuel. Adding trade tariffs on essential components like feedstocks, refining technology, and infrastructure only widened the cost gap. Trump-era tariffs on steel and machinery, for instance, raised capital expenditure costs for SAF plant construction by an estimated 10–20%.

These cost increases trickled down the value chain, leading to higher per-gallon SAF prices. Airlines, already operating on razor-thin margins, were hesitant to commit to long-term SAF contracts at premium prices. This created a vicious cycle where producers couldn’t scale without demand, and demand wouldn’t materialize without price parity.

Even as government subsidies helped buffer some of the financial strain, the policy uncertainty introduced by trade wars made long-term financial planning a challenge. Investors, too, pulled back from large-scale SAF projects, instead favoring lower-risk renewable energy ventures.

Global Trade Wars vs. Green Aviation Goals: Who Wins?

The core conflict here lies between protectionist economic policies and global environmental mandates. Trade wars by nature disrupt international cooperation, while climate change is a global issue requiring cross-border collaboration. When Trump-era tariffs disrupted the flow of sustainable technologies, feedstocks, and capital, it posed a serious setback for climate-aligned aviation goals.

International SAF initiatives, such as those driven by ICAO and the EU, had to adapt without U.S. leadership. Countries like Germany, France, and the Netherlands accelerated their own SAF production plans, capturing market share and technical leadership in the process. Meanwhile, the U.S. temporarily lost its competitive edge.

In the long run, the trade war served as a cautionary tale: nationalistic policies may serve domestic industries in the short term, but they can undermine global progress in sustainability. To meet 2030 and 2050 climate targets, the SAF market needs more collaboration, not less.

Tariff Aftershocks: How SAF Policy and Investment Strategies Are Evolving in the U.S.

In the aftermath of the trade war, U.S. policy toward SAF has undergone a significant shift. The Biden administration has moved away from unilateral tariffs and instead promoted multilateral climate cooperation. The Inflation Reduction Act provides SAF-specific tax credits, while the Federal Aviation Administration is actively funding SAF R&D.

Investment is also bouncing back. Venture capital and institutional investors are increasingly interested in SAF startups, especially those focusing on novel feedstocks and modular refining units. Many investment strategies now include clauses that protect against geopolitical risks, and some funds have even created SAF-specific portfolios.

Airlines are becoming more proactive. United, Delta, and American Airlines have all signed SAF purchase agreements and invested in domestic SAF startups. These moves signal a growing confidence that the market has stabilized and that the U.S. is serious about achieving long-term SAF scalability.

Trump Tariffs and the Global SAF Market: Winners, Losers, and the Road Ahead

During the height of the trade war, several international players stepped in to fill the void left by the U.S. retreat. European nations continued to lead in SAF policy innovation, while Asian countries like Japan and Singapore made strategic investments in bio-refineries.

Many smaller SAF firms in the U.S. struggled to survive the uncertainty. The lack of clear policy direction combined with increased costs made it difficult to secure funding. This period also led to a shakeout, where only the most resilient and innovative firms survived.

As tariffs gradually ease and new trade agreements are negotiated, the global SAF market is realigning. There's renewed interest in transatlantic collaboration, and SAF hubs are emerging in California, Texas, and the Midwest. The road ahead will require balancing national interests with international cooperation to ensure that the aviation sector can truly decarbonize.

How Protectionism Shaped the Future of Sustainable Aviation Fuel in America

Ultimately, the Trump trade war served as a stress test for the SAF industry. While the short-term effects were damaging—higher costs, reduced investment, and policy fragmentation—the long-term impact has been more nuanced. The industry has emerged more resilient, more domestically focused, and more aware of the geopolitical factors that can influence its growth.

Protectionism inadvertently sparked a conversation about the importance of domestic supply chains, technological independence, and energy sovereignty. These conversations are now driving policy and investment decisions that could shape the future of green aviation in America for decades to come.

If the U.S. can learn from past mistakes and adopt a balanced approach to trade and sustainability, it still has a chance to lead the global SAF revolution.

With €2.3 million ($2.5 million) in pre-seed funding and grants of around €300,000 ($324,000), Spark e-Fuels may soon bring sustainable air travel closer.

As Climate Insider reported, the Berlin-based company has developed proprietary e-fuel technology that optimizes how sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is produced.

According to the United States Department of Energy, SAF is a synthetic fuel created from ""non-petroleum feedstocks."" While SAF still produces planet-warming pollution when burned, the DoE noted that compared to conventional jet fuel, it can reduce emissions by 94%.

However, it still requires a lot of energy to create, which is why more efficient processes that don't rely on dirty fuels are needed.

While renewable energy sources like wind and solar are cheaper and more accessible than ever, their intermittent availability makes it tough to produce SAF at scale — something Spark's system is designed to overcome. The company plans to test the tech in its first e-fuel pilot plant soon.

""For sustainable aviation fuel to become the industry standard, production must be both scalable and cost-competitive,"" Mathias Bösl, CEO and co-founder of Spark e-Fuels, told Climate Insider. ""Our technology unlocks this potential by integrating renewable energy in a demand-responsive way.""

This could be a huge win for both travelers and the planet. If SAF can be produced at scale reliably and affordably, it would help airlines to cut pollution, lower transportation costs, and improve air quality for surrounding communities.

""We were drawn to Spark's ability to integrate renewable energy into chemical production in a demand-responsive way,"" said Isabella Fandrych, General Partner at Nucleus Capital, one of the investors. ""This approach is not only essential for SAF but has wider applications across the chemical industry, which must decarbonize rapidly.""

There's growing momentum behind clean fuels as aviation works to reduce its climate footprint — it's a $50 billion market. SAF is expected to make up less than 0.7% of total jet fuel production in 2025, but companies like Spark could help ramp that up. Plus, Spark's technology will also aid the green energy transition in the overall chemical industry.

More and more companies are moving toward innovative clean energy solutions, such as Walmart putting EV charging stations at hundreds of stores and European energy companies working to reduce carbon pollution.

""The airline industry's decarbonization must be seen as part of the global energy transition, not compartmentalized as a transport issue,"" said Marie Owens Thomsen of the IATA.

The initiative aims to create a standardized global market for SAF, facilitating transparent transactions and promoting adoption. The platform is now live, with over 30 early users onboard, including airlines, fuel producers, government entities, and corporate travel management companies.

Fuel remains the largest source of emissions in the aviation sector. SAF, derived from sources such as waste oils and agricultural residues, has the potential to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 85% compared to conventional jet fuel. However, widespread adoption is constrained by limited supply and high costs. IATA estimates SAF production reached 1 million tonnes in 2024—equivalent to 1.3 billion liters—doubling 2023 volumes but still accounting for just 0.3% of global jet fuel output.

The SAF Registry seeks to address supply challenges by enabling stakeholders to transparently track SAF transactions and their environmental attributes across the value chain. It allows airlines and corporate customers to claim environmental benefits under regulatory frameworks and voluntary sustainability programs, preventing double counting of emissions reductions.

“Aviation’s decarbonization is a team effort. With the launch of the SAF Registry, we have provided a critical platform that ensures all airlines can access SAF and claim their purchases against climate-related obligations,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President of Sustainability and Chief Economist.

The Registry operates as a global system for standardized SAF transaction recording. It is technology- and feedstock-neutral, encouraging diverse SAF production pathways worldwide. By decoupling SAF attributes from physical location, the platform allows airlines to access fuel benefits regardless of where the SAF is physically uplifted, improving accessibility and usability.

“While this is a significant and historic advance, it is just one step toward a mature, transparent, and liquid global SAF market. The Registry alone cannot create miracles, but without it, no miracles are possible,” Thomsen added.

Participation in the SAF Registry will be free of charge until April 2027, after which it will transition to a cost-recovery operational model. The platform is designed for interoperability with other registries, fostering competition and integration across markets.

“The Registry addresses the critical challenge of limited SAF supply — scarce and geographically concentrated — by connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers globally. It also enables corporate customers to access in-sector emissions reductions, leveraging their ability to co-finance decarbonization costs,” IATA stated.

IATA stressed the need for strong policy intervention to advance SAF adoption further. “Progress requires active policy support to scale up renewable energy production, including SAF. Governments must redirect subsidies from fossil fuels to renewable energy. The successes of the wind and solar energy markets provide a blueprint, and we must act without delay,” Thomsen concluded.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-04/IATA%20Launches%20SAF%20Registry%20for%20Global%20Fuel%20Transparency.jpg?h=9e53bbac&itok=2RcmGA22,N,,2025-04-08 15:56:34.654330

The aircraft is powered by the latest generation of Rolls-Royce engines, achieving a 25% reduction in fuel consumption compared to previous generation models, alongside a similar decrease in carbon emissions.

In line with industry sustainability efforts, the A350 can operate with up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with Airbus aiming for its aircraft to be capable of using 100% SAF by 2030.

The A350 Family has garnered over 1,360 orders from 60 customers globally, with more than 640 aircraft currently in service across 38 operators, primarily on long-haul routes.

EVA Air president Clay Sun said: “The new additions to our fleet reaffirm our commitment to sustainable aviation and delivering an exceptional travel experience.

“Both the A350-1000 and A321neo set a high standard in their respective categories, offering remarkable efficiency and comfort to our passengers.”

The A321neo, part of the A320neo Family, features the latest technologies, including new generation engines, Sharklets, and cabin efficiency enhancements, collectively delivering a 20% improvement in fuel savings.

Since its launch in 2016, the A321neo has received over 6,800 orders from more than 90 customers, capturing over 80% of the market share in its category.

Airbus commercial aircraft business sales EVP Benoit de Saint-Exupery said: “EVA Air’s new orders underscore the enduring appeal of the A350-1000 Long Range Leader as the benchmark for intercontinental operations, and the A321neo as a leader in regional efficiency.”

Last month, Airbus partnered with Japan Airlines, Nippon Paper Industries, Sumitomo Corporation, and Green Earth Institute to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

This collaboration aims to support a low-carbon society and help the aviation industry reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, using bioethanol sourced from domestic wood.",https://www.airport-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2025/04/Eva-air-image.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 13:56:44.086959

This annual event is the preeminent conference for sharing best practices about airport planning, terminal technologies, and improving passenger experience. It’s a window into the technologies and trends that will shape the airport of the future. It’s also an opportunity to learn about the challenges and pressures facing airport executives as they work to build a more seamless and streamlined airport experience for the world’s ever-increasing population of air travelers.

This year’s event comes at an incredibly important time in the commercial aviation industry – when rising passenger numbers, labor shortages, and new technologies are coming together to drive massive innovation in today’s modern airports.

We were recently joined by Anthony James, editor of PT World, the official publication of PTE 2025, to learn more about the trends and technologies that will be on display at this year’s event.

Connected Aviation Today (CAT): With PTE 2025 on the horizon, what would you say are the largest challenges facing modern airports?

Anthony James: I recently sat down with experts at airports and aviation authorities responsible for airport master planning, and they suggested that it’s no longer enough for airports to only consider how best to expand their capacity to meet future passenger growth.

Today, airports need to give careful consideration and planning towards sustainability, climate resilience, and fuel and energy infrastructure while also increasing digitalization and minimizing exposure to cyberattacks. They need to think about all these critical challenges while also dealing with an ever-increasing number of passengers.

CAT: What are the technologies that airports are embracing to help overcome these challenges? How far along are global airports in the adoption of these technologies?

Anthony James: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one area that all airports are currently exploring to help them become more efficient and improve their operations. In so doing, they will also improve the passenger experience.

“There is a strong vision and desire across airports and the larger commercial aviation industry for a fully automated, contactless, seamless passenger journey.” – Anthony James

There are numerous recent examples of airports embracing AI. Airports are exploring AI tools and solutions to minimize aircraft turnaround and detect foreign object debris on the runway. They’re also using AI chatbots to improve customer service. AI can also help speed security screening, while biometrics will help to speed border clearance.

CAT: There are numerous sessions and panel discussions planned for PTE 2025 around the “Future Airport.” What does the airport of the future look like? How is it different from what we have today?

Anthony James: There is a strong vision and desire across airports and the larger commercial aviation industry for a fully automated, contactless, seamless passenger journey.

There is also a consensus that the sector will likely see the widespread adoption of sustainable aviation fuel and perhaps even hydrogen or electric aircraft.

“Today, airports need to give careful consideration and planning towards sustainability, climate resilience, and fuel and energy infrastructure while also increasing digitalization and minimizing exposure to cyberattacks.” – Anthony James

CAT: It’s clear that Urban Air Mobility (UAM) – and the associated increase in drone and eVTOL aircraft traffic – is part of that future. What challenges does this create for airports? How are they adapting?

Anthony James: There are still clearly some air traffic integration issues, and UAM will require the creation of robust communication protocols between eVTOLs and ANSPs.

However, rather than a challenge, this is also a huge opportunity to boost airport connectivity and slash onward travel times for passengers.

“AI is one area that all airports are currently exploring to help them become more efficient and improve their operations.” – Anthony James

CAT: This year’s PTE is happening at a time of incredible change and advancement among commercial airlines and airports. Who should attend PTE, and what can they expect to learn at this year’s conference?

Anthony James: Everyone should attend! Not just airports – airlines, architects, urban planners, governments and aviation authorities, too. It’s the industry’s most important event.

PTE 2025 will be where everyone gets together to catch up with each other, share ideas, discuss their current projects, and source and discover new solutions and technologies – there is no greater opportunity to fast-track your understanding of this rapidly evolving sector!",https://connectedaviationtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/shutterstock_2467550689.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 12:56:29.369149

The new facility, located at the Holcim factory in Villaluenga de la Sagra (Toledo), is designed to capture over 700,000 tpy of CO2 during cement production.
Part of this CO2 will be combined with green H2 produced from renewable energy to be converted into sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF), reaching an estimated production of 100,000 tpy.
In this context, Over the first 10 years of operation, ECO2FLY will avoid emissions of over 6.5 million tons of CO2.
Ricardo de Pablos, CEO of Holcim España, said, “This strategic alliance between IGNIS P2X and Exolum represents a decisive step forward as part of our commitment to the transformation and decarbonization of the industry.","Holcim, IGNIS P2X and Exolum have formed a strategic partnership to develop ECO2FLY, an innovative CO2 circular economy project that will transform industrial emissions – inherent in the cement production process – into sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF). These sustainable fuels can directly replace conventional kerosene made from fossil fuel with no need for adaptations in aircraft or supply infrastructure, facilitating the immediate decarbonization of air transportation.

The new facility, located at the Holcim factory in Villaluenga de la Sagra (Toledo), is designed to capture over 700,000 tpy of CO2 during cement production. Part of this CO2 will be combined with green H2 produced from renewable energy to be converted into sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF), reaching an estimated production of 100,000 tpy. The remaining CO2 will be stored permanently in geological repositories.

The combination of technology and production capacity for the fuel of the future of aviation positions ECO2FLY as a leader in Europe for the decarbonization of key development sectors considered difficult to decarbonize. In this context, Over the first 10 years of operation, ECO2FLY will avoid emissions of over 6.5 million tons of CO2.

Ricardo de Pablos, CEO of Holcim España, said, “This strategic alliance between IGNIS P2X and Exolum represents a decisive step forward as part of our commitment to the transformation and decarbonization of the industry. Not only are we making progress on reducing the carbon emissions of our own processes, but we are also driving a key innovation for construction in the form of cement with a total carbon reduction.”

In this regard, Ignacio Casajús, Global Strategy & Growth Lead at Exolum, highlighted how “Exolum is making a firm commitment to the development of partnerships that allow the development of sustainable fuels that, as of today, are presented as the only viable solution to reducing carbon emissions in the short term in sectors like aviation and shipping.”

José Antonio Membiela, CEO of IGNIS P2X, considers this project “the most important in the production of synthetic aviation fuel currently produced in Spain, both in terms of size and strategic location and the circularity it offers partners (energy, CO2 capture, methanol production and consumption in aviation). ECO2FLY combines the sustainability of a business of great important to the surrounding area, such as the cement industry, with the creation of new industry for decarbonization, which will generate employment and wealth for the region.

For his part, Javier Esteban, Director of the Consortium and Partner of P2X Spain, states that “this project is an opportunity to be leaders in Europe in the production of eSAF, which represents an enormous strategic value for the Spanish economy. It will be the start of a new industry that will create employment and wealth, and a new energy paradigm for the country, with the opportunity to become exporters of renewable fuel on a large scale for the first time.”

Risk mitigation is top of mind for U.S. corporate issuers in 2025, as the current federal administration attacks diversity, equity and inclusion, or “DEI”.

Just pick up a newspaper or scroll through LinkedIn and you’ll see hundreds of responses to corporate DEI commitments (or retractions) in reaction to recent legal challenges and political rhetoric.

DEI as a practice has come under fire. Critics contend that programs intended to assist people from historically disadvantaged groups do more to divide than to foster genuine inclusion, undermining fairness and hiring for merit or capability. Proponents believe that DEI leads to better financial results by creating cultures where different perspectives mitigate risk and drive innovation, and that helping uplift people is the right thing to do.

Companies are facing a dilemma – reframe or remove DEI initiatives to avoid attack (but risk disenfranchising stakeholders that support DEI) or stand strong with their beliefs (and risk potential attacks from the administration or other important stakeholders).

As with all corporate strategy, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all roadmap or playbook on how to manage this dynamic. Company decisions will be more nuanced, to make commitments that are best for their unique stakeholders and ultimately, their business. While the media may be quick to jump on any company update as a “retreat” from the tenets of DEI, many businesses are reframing their commitment to DEI as simply “inclusion” or “belonging”, to create workplace cultures that welcome everyone and to generate financial success.

In today’s highly divided world, can companies create cultures where both sides are valued, and their respective positions are heard?

Welcome to DEI 2.0, focused on inclusion and belonging for financial results, versus social impact.

Here’s what we can expect from companies in the era of DEI 2.0.

Companies will reflect on their values and how DEI aligns with their moral and ethical foundation.

The moral and ethical foundation of DEI is fairness, based on the belief that every individual possesses inherent worth and dignity, regardless of their identity or background. This foundation is not likely to significantly change for most companies.

However, companies will tailor (and potentially change) the strategies and communications around their values to fit their customers and key stakeholders, ensuring that these efforts reflect the priorities of the communities they serve.

What does this mean in practice? A bell curve of responses from companies across the board:

Some companies will keep their existing programs and language in place. For select organizations, this means a continuity of trust with core customer and employee groups and a DEI strategy that remains unchanged, part of which involves lifting people up from historically disadvantaged demographics. This will be even more important for mission-driven organizations.

Most will reposition their programs and their language. This represents businesses that would like to maintain trust with existing customer and employee groups that support DEI – but need to adjust their framing and approach in response to feedback from opposing groups. This is the most common outcome that we are seeing today: a move toward inclusion and belonging for all (tied to financial success) and away from the social impact objective.

Some will roll-back programs entirely. For some organizations, particularly those who may have never bought in on the value of DEI, this represents retracting commitments entirely. This applies to companies answering to activist stakeholders in select geographic areas and/or those who cannot make the case for the business value of DEI in today’s environment.

Our advice:

Draw upon your code of ethics for guidance. These documents were developed by your predecessors and peers to ensure corporate integrity, and foster accountability to build trust and credibility with your stakeholders.

Don’t react to one stakeholder group while alienating another. Be inclusive to all. We are just now starting to see the spillover effects of corporations rolling back DEI programs – customer boycotts, employee lawsuits and other scrutiny. The backlash can often be just as intense as opposition to the initiatives themselves (Don’t believe me? Just ask Target these days!). Make sure that key stakeholders like employees or employee groups are fully considered before changing your course of action.

Even if diversity is “out”, inclusion is always “in”. While DEI is increasingly becoming weaponized, its core tenets are not. Inclusive environments lead to higher levels of innovation, creativity, and collaboration and diverse teams perform better when inclusion ensures that all voices are heard and valued. Figure out ways to include all your employees and create paths for growth for everyone.

Companies will be even more focused on connecting the dots between DEI 2.0 (inclusion and belonging) and financial value.

It will be more important than ever to make the link between a company’s approach to inclusion and belonging and long-term value creation.

Companies will need to evaluate initiatives, procedures, and programs to ensure they meet the objective of driving long-term financial resilience and performance. This will include linking initiatives to financial outcomes and revising communications (including policies, financial communications, job postings and reports) where needed, to better focus this point.

Integrating DEI 2.0 into core business strategies will allow for the full financial benefits of sustainability – which is always about helping companies to achieve competitive advantages, to capitalize on market trends, and to promote innovation.

The result? An organization that is more collaborative, better engaged, ready to meet challenges, and foster innovation.

Our advice:

Evaluate initiatives to ensure they meet the objective of financial value creation. Carry this through all your internal and external communication channels.

Tools like materiality assessments are helpful to reinforce that your sustainability priorities are aligned with key stakeholder views.

Consider the long-term impact. Administrations change every 4-8 years and reacting to today’s political challenges may be detrimental to your long-term strategy and goals. Identify a lane and stay consistent.

Companies will make language changes to avoid legal scrutiny and overall politicization.

Whether announced publicly through a press release or scrubbed in the cover of night, companies will make shifts around how they discuss DEI programs moving forward. For some, this may simply be a rebrand of efforts or for others, a name change to reflect the complete overhaul of a program. In general, many companies are moving away from the language of social impact objectives, quotas, and goals.

Our advice:

Consider some of these shifts that we are seeing to promote a broader sense of inclusion:

Programmatic names are changing from “DEI” or “DEIB” to “Belonging” or “Inclusion”

Employee resource groups or “ERGs” are being expanded to “Affinity” groups, affirming any employee can participate

“Diversity” is being broadened to cut across racial and gender lines (i.e. “first-generation college graduates” or “disadvantaged backgrounds”)

“Pay equity” is being repositioned as a tool for employee retention

Keep all disclosures and communications around sustainability and DEI precise and clarify any nuance to ensure that all efforts can be tied to your overall business strategies.

Companies will continue to prioritize profit.

Like it or not, the DEI conversation has solidified that corporations’ biggest priority in the U.S. is driving profit – and that includes managing today’s political highwire.

While the past decade has seen some momentous shifts in our working culture (including the radical transformation of remote work), today’s DEI debates make clear that companies must balance multiple stakeholder groups in their pursuit of financial value.

Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily ¬– our view is that this creates a more transparent environment in which all key stakeholders have a better sense of the values and the ideals of the company.

2025 has proven to be a major inflection point for U.S. companies of all size. But instead of looking at this moment as an abandonment of sustainability principles, we could view this shift as an opportunity to advance DEI to be ever more inclusive, and to better tie inclusion to long-term financial performance and innovation.

DEI as a construct lives on in many of the reframed programs and initiatives in 2025. The language may be different, but the foundational values remain the same for the companies doing it right – fairness and creating cultures where people feel comfortable, celebrated and able to do meaningful work that enables financial success for all.

If our programs unintentionally divide people on either side, then we need to be open to constructive feedback and continuous improvement until everyone feels included.",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Third-Economy-Spitler2.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 12:57:00.273117

Without policy, sustainability efforts risk being unstructured and fragmented, leaving companies unaligned in their initiatives.

As business aviation organizations seek to operate more sustainably while maintaining operational efficiency, evolving regulations introduce new challenges and opportunities. Operators must find ways to navigate these complexities and stay abreast of what’s happening in the sector.

Digitalization will be crucial to ensuring they can stay compliant in this competitive and more sustainable landscape.

Sustainability: What’s New In 2025

2025 marks a significant year for the industry’s drive to a more sustainable future as several new regulations come into effect.

In the UK, the government administered its Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate on Jan. 1st which requires all jet fuel supplied to the country to contain at least 2% SAF.

While the legislation marks a significant step forward in the industry’s drive to reduce harmful fossil fuel emissions, it requires operators to overcome new financial hurdles. Jet owners, aircraft management, and charter companies that operate in the UK will need to invest more in the short term as SAF production continues to scale. We’ll likely see business aviation organizations turn to technology to alleviate new pressures, thanks to the long-term cost and time saving benefits it offers.

In Europe, we’ll continue to see regulations emphasize emissions tracking and transparency. EASA has already outlined its mandate to standardize environmental impact information, allowing passengers to compare the environmental impact of their flights more easily. The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) also introduced new reporting requirements for non-CO₂ emissions from Jan.1, 2025, and the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is set to become mandatory from the start of next year.

These measures reinforce Europe’s move toward more rigorous environmental disclosure and lifecycle emissions analysis, which will require operators to introduce accurate tracking systems and reporting methods.

Proactive engagement and investment in technology will be essential for operators to successfully navigate these evolving regulations, as well as boost emission transparency between stakeholders.

In the US, similar reporting mandates have been implemented. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has adopted a rule requiring public companies, including non-U.S. firms with shares traded in the U.S., to report elements of their environmental footprint, including Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Corporate flight departments and managed aircraft used by large public companies will need to invest in technologies that ensure accurate and efficient emissions tracking, with first disclosures being scheduled for 2026 to cover Fiscal Year 2025 reporting.

Sustainability initiatives in the U.S. are also developing through incentive programs. The Clean Fuel Production Credit (CFPC) rewards SAF producers based on emission reductions.

For business jet operators, this means that while there is no direct obligation to incorporate SAF into their fuel mix, the increasing availability and potential cost reductions of SAF in the future – driven by these incentives – could make adoption easier and more appealing over time.

Navigating Changes With Digitalization

Complying to a range of new regulations, which differ from region to region, introduces complexities for business aviation organizations. Businesses will need to remain agile as mandates continue to evolve and reshape the industry’s future.

Technology is becoming increasingly critical. Among large scale projects, introducing digital systems at an administrative level can be the key to a more flexible approach. For example, digital document management solutions can significantly streamline regulatory adherence. Traditional, paper-based systems often exceed hundreds of pages of information, making it difficult to adapt when changes to an existing regulation are issued or new framework introduced.

Digitalization can condense all information into one accessible platform, while automatically updating and flagging regulatory changes. This is an extremely beneficial practice for business aviation operators looking to save time, drive operational efficiency, and remain compliant.

The introduction of large language models (LLM) in aviation documentation further enhances these opportunities. Navigating regulatory information can be time-consuming. With AI, users can ask questions about a new regulation and receive descriptive answers, not only saving time spent sourcing relevant information but further improving compliance.

Is The Future Digital?

As environmental regulations become more complex and diverse, forward-looking business aviation operators must prioritize digitalization to remain competitive. Digital tools are integral to the operational efficiency that modern businesses require in an evolving regulatory environment. Digital documentation platforms are one example, working to significantly reduce the burden of managing multiple frameworks. In a shifting industry, those who adapt early to digital solutions will be best positioned to thrive in an increasingly regulated future.
