The current situation in the production of sustainable aviation fuels is presented along with challenges related to its use. Lignocellulosic biomass is considered a promising feedstock for the production of aviation fuels; its composition, as well as possible conversion routes, are analyzed. Emphasis is placed on the levulinic acid as a component received as a result of biomass processing. It is proposed to convert levulinic acid into alkyl levulinates using different simple alcohols to use them as components of sustainable aviation fuels. The method of alkyl levulinates synthesis is described. The basic physical-chemical properties of received products are determined and analyzed. Alkyl levulinates’ properties are compared to conventional jet fuel’s properties. Based on the experimental data, the possibilities of f using lignocellulosic biomass use for sustainable aviation fuel production are substantiated.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/assets/img/ieee_logo_smedia_200X200.png,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10380174/,2025-02-25 00:00:02.446187
