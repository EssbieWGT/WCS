In an interview with Turkish news agency Anadolu, Uraloglu said the shift is being led by the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) directive recently issued by Türkiye’s Civil Aviation Directorate.
Under the new directive, the use, supply, and monitoring of aviation fuels will conform to international technical benchmarks, including the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
The SAF directive excludes humanitarian, medical, firefighting, and state-owned aircraft flights.
“We will continue our efforts to ensure that Türkiye achieves a strong and green aviation system, in line with international standards through regulations like the SAF Directive,” Uraloglu said.","Türkiye’s civil aviation sector is entering a “green era” that prioritizes environmental responsibility, domestic production, and alignment with global standards, Transport and Infrastructure Minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu said Friday.

In an interview with Turkish news agency Anadolu, Uraloglu said the shift is being led by the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) directive recently issued by Türkiye’s Civil Aviation Directorate.

“Türkiye has taken a step toward a policy that is environmentally friendly and climate responsible, which is not only important for the environment but also for our industrial policies and energy supply security,” Uraloglu said.

The country’s aviation and transport strategies have been reshaped in line with its 2053 net zero emissions target, he noted.

Under the new directive, the use, supply, and monitoring of aviation fuels will conform to international technical benchmarks, including the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

The regulation aims to reduce dependence on imported fuel and foster domestic refinery investment, supporting a technology-driven production infrastructure.

Directive applies to all national and international air carriers

“This directive applies to all national and international air carriers operating international flights, airport operators, non-hazardous workplaces, and individuals licensed by Türkiye’s Energy Market Regulatory Authority, covering flights from Türkiye and operations involving aircraft with a maximum takeoff weight exceeding 5,700 kilograms (12,566 pounds),” Uraloglu said.

The SAF directive excludes humanitarian, medical, firefighting, and state-owned aircraft flights.

“The directorate will announce the required SAF use and the minimum emission reduction per liter before the end of the third quarter each year on its website,” he added. “Fuel suppliers must ensure SAF-blended fuel meets the emission reduction requirement, and air carriers will be obligated to consume the specified amount.”

He also stated that carriers departing from Türkiye will be required to load at least 90% of their fuel needs from within the country under the directive.

Uraloglu emphasized that SAF must meet ICAO's current standards and technical specifications. He added that Türkiye’s leading energy players, including refinery operator Tupras, are finalizing preparations to begin SAF commercial production by 2026.

Other major investors, such as SOCAR Türkiye, a subsidiary of Azerbaijan’s state-owned oil firm, are also taking part in the initiative.

“The collaboration between Trinity College Dublin and Dublin Airport exemplifies the kind of forward-thinking partnerships that are essential for driving innovation and real change as we all make our way towards a Net Zero world.”","Trinity College Dublin has developed a new carbon capture technology currently undergoing testing at Dublin Airport.

The initiative is funded by a European Innovation Council (EIC) Transition grant called AirInMotion and supported by Enterprise Ireland. It aims to demonstrate the technology’s potential in the aviation and e-fuel sectors.

This Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology focuses on scalable, energy-efficient solutions for capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

It plays a crucial role in reducing industrial emissions and is essential for achieving net-zero targets and combating climate change, according to Trinity.

The technology was created by Professor Wolfgang Schmitt and Dr Sebastien Vaesen from Trinity’s School of Chemistry and the AMBER Centre for Advanced Materials and BioEngineering Research.

For the past three months, the demonstrator has been operational at Dublin Airport, collecting vital data on its efficiency, operational stability, and energy consumption.

The results from this test are expected to validate the technology’s performance and guide future development and commercial applications.

Schmitt said: “By advancing and integrating this technology across industries, we are not only reducing emissions but also creating economic opportunities through supplying high-purity CO₂ that aligns with global sustainability goals.”

Dr Elham Katoueizadeh, the project developer, emphasised that after over a decade of research and innovation, the technology is now ready for large-scale implementation across various industries.

Following the initiation of this field test, the team is focused on securing additional investment and forming partnerships to accelerate commercial adoption.

This project aligns with the European Commission’s ReFuelEU Aviation legislation, which mandates that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) must constitute 2% of fuel at EU airports by 2025, increasing to 70% by 2050.

Furthermore, the legislation requires that e-fuels, produced from renewable electricity and sustainable carbon dioxide, account for 50% of SAF.

Andrea Carroll, sustainability director at global airports and travel retail group Daa said: “This project offers Daa an opportunity to explore carbon capture as a potential means of decarbonising our operations and industry.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam (CAAV) has submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Construction to inform the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) of the country’s intent to join the scheme.

The move “reflects Vietnam’s commitment to mitigating the aviation sector’s impact on climate change,” according to a government statement, published last week on the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment.

CORSIA, launched by ICAO in 2016, aims to achieve carbon-neutral growth in international aviation through market-based measures.

Countries opting into the voluntary phase, which ends in 2026, must notify ICAO by June 30 of the prior year.

Relevant: Vietnam Approves Carbon Market Development Plan

Initial estimates suggest that Vietnam’s aviation industry could spend between USD 5.6 million and USD 37.5 million annually on carbon credits once enrolled.

This step reinforces Vietnam’s broader climate goals and supports policies promoting sustainable aviation fuel, particularly in line with the European Union’s frameworks.

To prepare, CAAV has already implemented a Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from international flights and issued regulations for fuel use and emissions tracking.

It has also engaged with other ministries to develop national strategies and address challenges.

CORSIA’s mandatory phase will begin in 2027, and Vietnam’s early participation signals its readiness to take part in global climate governance and support sustainable aviation development.

Jet fuel production will rise by 20,000 bpd, while the production of Group II lubricating oils will grow by 12,000 bpd.
With ANP authorization secured, commercial production is set to commence shortly, reaching a potential output of 50,000 m³ per month (10,000 bpd).
This R$4 billion project will utilize natural gas processed via Route 3 at Boaventura and is currently under internal approval processes.","Petrobras has announced a comprehensive investment initiative amounting to roughly R$33 billion, aimed at bolstering its refining and petrochemical operations in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Out of this total, R$29 billion will be sourced from Petrobras’ own capital expenditure (Capex), while an additional R$4 billion will be allocated to a complementary project aligned with Petrobras assets.

A major portion of the funds—estimated at R$26 billion—is earmarked for integration projects at the Boaventura Energy Complex in Itaboraí and the Duque de Caxias Refinery (Reduc). These investments are part of Petrobras’ 2025–2029 Business Plan (PN 2025–2029), with bidding processes for associated service contracts already underway.

One of the key outcomes of these developments will be a significant enhancement in the production capacity of refined fuels. The upgrades are expected to add 76,000 barrels per day (bpd) of S-10 diesel, comprising 56,000 bpd from quality improvements and 20,000 bpd from new capacity. Jet fuel production will rise by 20,000 bpd, while the production of Group II lubricating oils will grow by 12,000 bpd.

The Boaventura Complex will also house a dedicated Bio Jet Fuel plant, capable of producing 19,000 bpd of renewable fuels, including Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Additionally, two gas-fired power plants are planned at the complex and will participate in future capacity reserve auctions. These units will benefit from existing synergies with the Itaboraí Natural Gas Processing Unit (UPGN), whose infrastructure will support their operations.

At Reduc, a lubricant oil re-refining initiative is being explored, which would handle approximately 30,000 m³ per month (equivalent to 6,300 bpd). This project complements the Group II lubricant oil production at Boaventura and introduces circular economy practices by transforming used oil into valuable products. Regulatory approval for co-processing tests has already been obtained from the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP), with trials expected later this year.

Reduc has also achieved a milestone in decarbonization, completing a successful SAF test using up to 1.2% corn oil. With ANP authorization secured, commercial production is set to commence shortly, reaching a potential output of 50,000 m³ per month (10,000 bpd). Additionally, the refinery already produces Diesel R5 and is preparing to begin tests on Diesel R7, which will contain 7% renewable content.

To enhance operational efficiency, Petrobras plans to construct a modern thermal power plant at Reduc, replacing outdated systems. This effort, requiring R$860 million in investment, is aimed at aligning the refinery with top global energy efficiency standards. A further R$2.4 billion is allocated for planned maintenance shutdowns at Reduc between 2025 and 2029, with major activities scheduled for 2026.

In the petrochemical domain, Petrobras is evaluating a project to produce acetic acid and monoethylene glycol (MEG) at Boaventura. Both are vital raw materials for the chemical and plastics industries, and Brazil currently depends heavily on imports for these products. In tandem, Braskem, in which Petrobras holds a stake, is planning to expand its polyethylene production capacity by up to 230,000 tons per year.

Next Steps For Solar Gasoline Synhelion began producing began producing fuels in quantity at the DAWN facility last year, and it has been busy since then.","If US President Donald Trump really wants to do his friends in the fossil fuel industry any favors, he’s going to have to try a lot harder. The global economy is moving into a new, low-carbon industrial era with or without any help from the former British colonies. The latest example comes from Switzerland, where the startup Synhelion has just showcased its new “solar gasoline” on a tour of the mountains, in the gas tank of a classic 1985 Audi Sport quattro.

What Is This Solar Gasoline Of Which You Speak?

If “solar gasoline” brings the e-fuels industry to mind, that’s close but no cigar. The emerging category of e-fuels, or electrofuels, generally refers to liquid fuels synthesized with green hydrogen, which is produced from water in electrolysis systems that run on electricity from renewable resources. Synhelion also uses renewable energy as the foundation of its system. However, the company deploys renewable energy — specifically, solar energy — in the form of heat.

The company’s integrated process focuses on deploying solar energy to produce syngas (synthetic gas composed of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) from biogas and water, through a thermochemical reaction. The reaction requires high heat, which is where the solar angle comes in. In effect, the syngas stores solar energy for later use, as a standard input for synthetic liquid fuels, including kerosene jet fuel as well as gasoline and diesel. “Such Sun-to-Liquid fuel closes the CO2 cycle, as it releases only as much CO2 during its combustion as was previously used for its production,” Synhelion states.

From Solar Gasoline To Solar Jet Fuel

As with e-fuels produced by water electrolysis, the result of Synhelion’s process is a drop-in replacement for fossil-based liquid fuels. That angle is particularly important in the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) movement. Conventional bio-based jet fuels have struggled mightily to qualify for use in aircraft. Currently they can be blended with traditional jet fuel, but they have yet to break through on a drop-in basis.

Aviation stakeholders have indicated that there is an economic case to be made for SAFs produced through the e-fuels pipeline. Synhelion provides SAF stakeholders with another option. The company surfaced on the CleanTechnica radar earlier this year with an SAF version of its solar fuel, produced at a facility in Spain.

A High Profile Solar Gasoline Showcase

The argument for replacing gasoline in an automobile with Synhelion’s solar gasoline is another kettle of fish, which explains the Audi Sport quattro showcase last month.

Synhelion used the occasion of the Supercar Owners Circle Classic Andermatt event in Switzerland last month to put its solar gasoline through its paces. The aim was to demonstrate that the company’s solar gasoline can replace its fossil-sourced counterpart without any modifications to an automobile — and without damage to the engine or any other part of a uniquely precious auto, of course.

“The 1985 Audi Sport quattro, part of the AMAG Classic car collection, became the first vehicle in history to run on solar gasoline produced at Synhelion’s industrial-scale plant DAWN in Jülich, Germany,” Synhelion pronounced in a press release on July 3.

“For the first time, we’ve shown that solar fuel can power a car in real-world conditions. It proves that our technology is ready for the road and that even iconic internal combustion engines can have a role in a green future,” added Synhelion Co-CEO and Co-Founder Philipp Furler.

What Is The Supercar Owners Circle?

For the record, the Supercar Owners Circle (SOC) is an exclusive network of auto collectors, recently acquired by the duPont Registry Group. Here’s what they had to say in the runup to last month’s Andermatt event:

“While SOC Classic, as the name implies, centers around vintage and classic metal like the Mercedes 300 SL Gullwing, Porsche 356, air-cooled 911s (including restomods), Alfa Romeos, Lancias, and old-school Ferraris, the mix of cars that showed up this year spanned several eras…Think Lamborghini Countach, Ferrari 512, F40, F50, Superamerica, and more.”

During the event, the solar-gassed Audi was driven by AMAG Group CEO Helmut Ruhl, who provided his feedback to the media. “What struck me most was how normal it felt — no difference compared to fossil gasoline, except for the significantly lower carbon emissions,” Ruhl stated.

“The car’s historic drive marks the debut of solar gasoline as a viable, drop-in fuel for existing internal combustion engines. No modifications were made to the Audi’s original 306 hp engine, demonstrating the compatibility of Synhelion’s renewable synthetic fuel with today’s vehicles and infrastructure,” Synhelion emphasized.

AMAG Loves Synthetic Fuels

SOC aside, AMAG is also a high profile showcase for synthetic fuels. The company, which bills itself as the biggest automotive firm in Switzerland, owns a mouthwatering collection of historic gasmobiles. AMAG also sells and services exceptional cars through its Classic division, and it is a Synhelion investor and customer, too.

Although AMAG states that it has no hearsay knowledge of any incompatibility between synthetic fuels and classic car engines, the company also notes that anecdotal evidence regarding compatibility is scanty. In order to reassure itself, and its classic car customers, the company recently engaged in a research effort to gather more data. “It was clear to us that the majority of owners of valuable classic cars would not embark on adventures with unexplored fuels,” explains the head of AMAG’s Classic division, Dino Graf.

The study was conducted by Empa (the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology), with support from the Swiss oil company Motorex. The study included extended engine component testing long with road tests and performance measurements on selected cars. “The result: Even classic cars can be operated in a climate-friendly manner in the future, as synthetic gasoline can be used safely in older engines,” AMAG reported.

Next Steps For Solar Gasoline

Synhelion began producing began producing fuels in quantity at the DAWN facility last year, and it has been busy since then. In addition to the classic car showcase and the SAF project in Spain, the company has fueled a motorcycle with its solar gasoline, and it has been pitching solar diesel as a drop-in replacement for steamboat engines.

The DAWN facility is located in Jülich, Germany. The output is only a few thousand liters per year, but that’s enough for the company to scout the globe for more opportunities to showcase its solar fuels.

It announced a sweeping $33 billion reais ($6 billion) investment plan centered in Rio de Janeiro. Through integrated refining, petrochemical and renewable fuel initiatives, the company aims to boost domestic fuel supply, support energy transition goals and stimulate industrial synergy across the value chain.

Boaventura and Reduc: The Heart of Integration

The core of the initiative lies in connecting the Boaventura Energy Complex in Itaboraí with the Duque de Caxias Refinery (Reduc). Together, these projects represent a R$26 billion investment, which is already included under Petrobras’ 2025-2029 Business Plan, wherein the service packages are currently in the bidding phase. Once operational, this infrastructure will enhance S-10 diesel output by 76,000 barrels per day (bpd), 56,000 bpd from quality improvements and 20,000 bpd from additional capacity. The project will also increase jet fuel production by 20,000 bpd and expand Group II lubricants output by 12,000 bpd.

Boaventura will also host a state-of-the-art biojet fuel facility producing 19,000 bpd of sustainable fuels, Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (“HVO”) and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”), alongside two 400 MW gas-fired thermoelectric plants. The power plants are designed to integrate with the nearby Itaboraí gas processing unit, participating in future capacity reserve auctions.

Circular Economy and Decarbonization at Reduc

At Reduc, Petrobras is exploring a lubricant oil re-refining unit with a monthly capacity of 30,000 m3 (6,300 bpd). This would enable the reuse of waste oil into high-value products, in line with circular economy practices. The facility has already gained regulatory approval for a co-processing test.

Reduc is also pushing renewable fuel production. A pilot to blend 1.2% corn oil into jet fuel has been successfully completed, paving the way for 10,000 bpd commercial-scale production. Diesel R5 with 5% renewable content is already in production and a Diesel R7 with 7% blend is under testing, reinforcing Petrobras’ ambition for low-carbon fuels.

In parallel, Petrobras plans to modernize its on-site power infrastructure with a new thermal plant to replace outdated steam and power generation equipment with investments of up to R$860 million. The company also plans to spend up to R$2.4 billion on maintenance shutdowns between 2025 and 2029 to ensure operational safety and efficiency.

Expanding Petrochemicals and Strategic Partnerships

Petrobras is also eyeing new petrochemical capabilities. Studies are underway for the local production of acetic acid and monoethylene glycol at Boaventura, materials that Brazil currently imports.

Braskem, a Petrobras affiliate, is expected to invest around R$4 billion in expanding its polyethylene plant. The project, which is subject to necessary approvals by Braskem's governance bodies, hinges on increased gas flow from Route 3 and aims to add 230,000 tons per year of production capacity.

The partnership between Petrobras and Braskem is strengthening, particularly as both seek to shift from naphtha to gas-based feedstocks like ethane for a competitive edge. Talks are also underway to supply Braskem’s Bahia operations with domestic gas, further reducing import reliance.

Looking Ahead: Gas Supply, Renewables and National Reach

Petrobras’ current focus is on boosting domestic gas availability. Reactivating shut-in gas wells and pursuing integration with Argentina and Bolivia are part of a broader strategy to lower prices and meet rising demand from Brazil’s expanding digital and industrial sectors.

Beyond Rio de Janeiro, Petrobras is preparing to invest in the second refining train at RNEST in Pernambuco (R$8 billion) and resume fertilizer production (R$6 billion). The company also plans a new bidding round to convert units at the Presidente Bernardes refinery for renewable fuel output.

As Petrobras sets its sights on a cleaner, more self-sufficient energy future, these investments reflect a decisive commitment to modernization, sustainability and long-term national benefit. The company's business plan also foresees a capex of $17 billion in the refining, transportation and commercialization area between 2025 and 2029.

The system has been running for three months in a live operational environment, supported by European Innovation Council funding. The team behind the technology aims to scale it for commercial deployment.

The system captures carbon dioxide directly from ambient air and releases it using low-grade industrial waste heat, resulting in a purified CO2 stream. While the precise materials are not disclosed, the team said that it focused on optimising energy use and operational conditions to improve capture efficiency and enable industrial deployment.

“By advancing and integrating this technology across industries, we are not only reducing emissions but also creating economic opportunities through supplying high-purity CO2 that align with global sustainability goals,” said Professor Wolfgang Schmitt, who helped develop the system.

The system, which captures CO2 from the air while utilising low-grade waste heat from on-site industries, is intended to help meet the European Commission’s ReFuelEU Aviation legislation, which states that SAF must comprise 2% of fuel at EU airports by 2025, increasing to 70% by 2050. It also requires that e-fuels, produced from renewable electricity and sustainable CO2, make up 50% of the SAF.

“This project offers DAA [Dublin Airport Authority] an opportunity to explore carbon capture as a potential means of decarbonising our operations and industry,” said Andrea Carroll, Director of Sustainability at DAA.

The demonstrator is collecting data on energy use, capture efficiency, and operational stability in real-world conditions. Insights from the trial will guide design improvements and support ongoing efforts to commercialise the system, according to technical lead Dr Sebastien Vaesen.

This breakthrough paves the way for converting abundant wet wastes into sustainable jet fuel, contributing significantly to greener aviation.","Wet wastes such as food waste and biomass present a valuable opportunity for producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). These wastes contain triglycerides that can convert into biocrude through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), making them promising feedstocks for greener fuels.

Challenges in Meeting SAF Fuel Standards

However, SAF precursors must satisfy stringent criteria based on conventional fuels like Jet A. In particular, they require complete oxygen removal to prevent jet engine corrosion and must achieve a higher heating value (HHV) close to Jet A. Unfortunately, no biocrude derived from HTL has met all these standards to date.

Innovative Use of Mo2C Nanocatalysts for Biocrude Upgrading

To address this challenge, researchers from the Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation (CABBI) investigated the use of zeolite-supported molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) nanocatalysts. According to Science X Daily, these nanocatalysts effectively upgrade wet waste-derived biocrudes into SAF precursors that meet all essential criteria for the first time.

Methodology: Generating and Testing Mo2C Nanocatalysts

The team generated Mo2C nanocatalysts in the gas phase and dispersed them onto zeolite supports. They then tested the catalysts’ ability to remove oxygen from biocrudes and used them to upgrade wet waste-derived biocrude via HTL. The upgraded biocrudes underwent thorough characterization against Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) specifications.

Promising Results in Fuel Quality and Catalyst Reusability

The results demonstrated complete oxygen removal from the biocrude and a high heating value of 46.5 MJ/kg, closely matching Jet A fuel. Additionally, prescreening tests revealed that the average carbon number of the distilled SAF fraction was 10.6, near the 11.4 typical of conventional jet fuel. The upgraded biocrude also met all key SAF prescreening standards, including surface tension, density, viscosity, flash point, and freezing point. Notably, the Mo2C nanocatalysts retained their deoxygenation activity over multiple reuse cycles.

Conclusion: Pioneering Sustainable Jet Fuel Production from Wet Waste

This study, published in Science Advances, demonstrates for the first time that zeolite-supported Mo2C nanocatalysts can catalytically upgrade wet waste-derived biocrudes into SAF precursors that satisfy all critical fuel specifications.

Conclusion: Building Bridges, Not Walls The SAF Matchmaker is more than a tool—it is a statement.","A New Era in Aviation Energy

The aviation sector is witnessing a transformative shift. As sustainability becomes an indispensable pillar of long-term viability, innovative approaches are needed not just in aircraft design or operations, but in the very fuel that powers flight. In a significant stride, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has introduced a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Matchmaker platform—a digital tool aimed at accelerating the uptake of SAF through smarter, simpler connections between suppliers and buyers.

This platform could prove to be more than just a technical facilitation tool. It may well evolve into a central mechanism for systemic change, particularly by reducing friction in the SAF supply chain and aligning market incentives toward emissions reduction goals.

Why a Matchmaker Platform Matters

Despite broad consensus on the critical role SAF will play in decarbonising aviation, access and procurement remain major bottlenecks. The SAF Matchmaker addresses this issue with a pragmatic digital solution that reflects a deeper truth—market alignment is as important as technological advancement.

Three key pillars underpin the platform’s design:

1. Centralised Efficiency

One of the most overlooked hurdles in SAF adoption is the fragmentation of its market. There is often no clear line of sight between producers who have SAF to sell and airlines looking to make sustainable purchases. By serving as a centralised hub where both parties can list and review opportunities, the platform eliminates time-consuming steps and reduces reliance on intermediaries. The absence of added fees further enhances its accessibility, inviting more participation and cultivating a broader ecosystem for voluntary SAF transactions.

2. Transparent Connectivity

Unlike conventional marketplaces driven solely by price competition, this platform foregrounds visibility. Airlines can indicate their interest based on current or future SAF volumes, while suppliers showcase their available and planned production. This matchmaking functionality simplifies the initial discovery process but leaves commercial negotiations to take place offline, ensuring confidentiality and flexibility.

Importantly, this fosters a network of direct engagements built on trust and relevance, rather than guesswork or limited supplier lists.

3. Enhanced Market Visibility

One of the more progressive features of the platform is the depth of information available about each SAF offer. Data includes feedstock sources, production location and technology, emissions reduction potential, and regulatory compliance with frameworks like CORSIA and the EU Renewable Energy Directive. This allows buyers to make informed decisions not just on price or volume, but on broader sustainability credentials, helping to align corporate ESG goals with procurement decisions.

A Pushback Against Inefficiencies

IATA Director General Willie Walsh has not shied away from critiquing existing market distortions. His comments highlight the tension between regulatory mandates and actual production incentives. Specifically, the EU’s 2 percent blending mandate has increased costs for airlines without proportionally boosting SAF output. Walsh has gone so far as to label the status quo a “great green scam,” referring to excessive compliance fees levied by some suppliers.

This backdrop underscores why initiatives like the SAF Matchmaker are more than digital utilities—they are instruments of market reform. By promoting transparency and reducing artificial barriers to entry, such tools help to rebalance power dynamics and foster fairer pricing environments.

Designed for Evolution

Initially limited to airlines and SAF producers, the Matchmaker platform is designed to evolve. Future access will expand to include non-aviation corporate buyers, potentially unlocking wider demand from sectors keen to support aviation decarbonisation through indirect SAF purchases or credit-based systems.

In doing so, the platform could also pave the way for multi-sector collaboration, introducing models where logistics firms, technology providers, and even public sector actors co-invest in SAF infrastructure or purchase agreements. Such synergies can amplify the sustainability benefits far beyond aviation alone.

The platform is hosted on the Aviation Energy Hub, a dedicated digital space aimed at improving energy management in aviation. This makes the SAF Matchmaker part of a broader suite of tools, each one addressing a different facet of aviation’s complex energy transformation.

What This Means for the Industry

The launch of this platform signals a maturing SAF ecosystem—one where transparency, access, and innovation begin to converge. It reflects a growing consensus that sustainability must be embedded not just in ambition but in infrastructure and operations.

More subtly, it also highlights a shift in mindset: sustainability professionals are moving away from reliance on policy nudges or unilateral commitments. Instead, they are building architecture that lowers the friction of doing the right thing—platforms, frameworks, and toolkits that turn aspiration into action.

Such digital infrastructure is indispensable to closing the gap between climate targets and tangible outcomes.

Conclusion: Building Bridges, Not Walls

The SAF Matchmaker is more than a tool—it is a statement. A declaration that collaboration, not competition, will be the hallmark of aviation’s sustainable future. It also reflects a broader truth in the journey to net zero: systemic change requires systemic thinking.

By designing platforms that address not only supply or demand but also the mechanics of interaction between them, the industry is proving that progress can be purposeful and strategic. As aviation redefines its energy narrative, such initiatives will form the backbone of both accountability and acceleration.

The pilot project is designed to be scalable and aims to meet the rising demand for SAF in the region.

Oiltek, a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore-listed Oiltek International, is supporting the SAF roadmap and has a track record of building renewable energy facilities across Asia, including a 600 MTD integrated biodiesel plant in Bintulu. The firm also developed a POME (Palm Oil Mill Effluent) oil treatment facility that supplies high-quality feedstock to global HVO producers.

SEDCE is also working with Apeiron Bioenergy, Asia’s largest used cooking oil (UCO) collector, to establish a sustainable UCO logistics and collection ecosystem in Sarawak. This partnership aims to secure a stable feedstock supply for the SAF plant while promoting circular economy goals.

SEDC Energy CEO Robert Hardin noted that SAF production requires hydrogen to convert feedstock into jet fuel, aligning the project with Sarawak’s broader ambitions in developing its hydrogen value chain.

The project comes amid mounting global pressure for aviation decarbonisation, as the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s CORSIA scheme enters its mandatory phase in 2027.

However, the heavy carbon footprints of long-haul flights are also making air travel increasingly environmentally unsustainable and a serious concern. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents a breakthrough in sustainable aviation. Unlike conventional jet fuel derived from petroleum, SAF is produced from a diverse range of renewable feedstocks. As a strong advocate for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), Indian industrialist and energy visionary Vasanth JB views Southeast Asia as a regional force that can lead the global charge toward cleaner skies.

What is SAF?

Unlike regular jet fuel, SAF is sustainable as an aviation fuel. It is produced from renewable feedstocks, like waste oils, agricultural residues, municipal solid waste, and even captured carbon dioxide.

The fundamental distinction lies not in its combustion properties as SAF performs identically to conventional jet fuel in aircraft engines. Sustainability comes from SAF’s lifecycle carbon profile. SAF feedstocks are specifically selected to avoid competition with food production, prevent deforestation, and minimize water consumption, and thus encompasses a comprehensive approach to sustainability. SAF production contributes to broader environmental goals rather than merely shifting environmental burdens from one sector to another.

In a world increasingly conscious of climate imperatives, few voices resonate with both clarity and conviction like that of Indian industrialist and energy visionary Vasanth JB. As a strong advocate for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), Vasanth sees Southeast Asia not just as a passive consumer in the aviation transition, but as a regional force that could lead the global charge toward cleaner skies.

“The ASEAN bloc is poised for a fuel transformation. With the right policy coordination and industry participation, Southeast Asia could become the world’s most cost-effective, feedstock-rich SAF region.” - Vasanth JB during a closed-door session with energy executives in Kuala Lumpur.

The SAF Momentum in ASEAN: A Perfect Takeoff Runway

ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries are aligning their strategies with ICAO’s (International Civil Aviation Organization) CORSIA framework. It encompasses net-zero targets and lays the policy and infrastructure groundwork for widespread adoption of SAF.

Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam have made concrete contributions, starting from formulating SAF blending mandates, repurposing refineries, to securing long-term procurement agreements with international carriers.

According to Vasanth, the synergy among policy, industry, and airport infrastructure is creating “a golden corridor for green aviation” in Southeast Asia.

Airports Fuel the Future

One of the clearest indicators of progress is the commitment from major ASEAN airports to integrate SAF infrastructure into their fueling systems. These airports are:

●Changi International Airport (Singapore)

●KLIA (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia)

●Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (Jakarta, Indonesia)

●Suvarnabhumi Airport (Bangkok, Thailand)

They are in various stages of feasibility studies and infrastructure upgrades for SAF blending, storage, and distribution pipelines. These upgrades will be rolled out in phases between 2026 and 2030, reflecting an accelerated transition to operational readiness.

Feedstock Richness: The ASEAN Advantage

A defining strength for ASEAN is its abundance of feedstock sources suitable for HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids)-based SAF:

●Malaysia and Indonesia lead in palm oil waste and used cooking oil.

●Thailand and Vietnam offer large volumes of agricultural residues.

●Singapore is becoming the logistics and refining nexus

In fact, “feedstock availability and logistics integration give ASEAN an edge over other regions,” said Vasanth as part of his discussions with several SAF startups and biofuel traders across the region.

Harmonizing Regional Targets: The Next Milestone

The emerging policy harmonization across ASEAN countries is extremely promising for many players in the region’s biofuel sector. While blending mandates are currently under national jurisdiction, informal dialogues suggest a regional SAF target announcement. This will be potentially modeled on the EU’s ReFuelEU initiative.

A multi-nation regional target would reduce fragmentation, pool investment across borders, and give global investors a coherent, scalable framework for entering the ASEAN SAF market.",https://www.sangritoday.com/uploads/images/202507/image_870x580_68678ce7b19c1.webp,N,,2025-07-04 07:05:40.415553

Energy Complex (Itaboraí – RJ) and Reduc (Duque de Caxias – RJ) involves an estimated investment of R$26 billion. This amount is included in the 2025 - 2029 Business Plan (PN 2025 - 2029), and service packages for the projects are currently in the bidding phase.

This new structure will increase S-10 diesel production by 76 000 bpd, 56 000 of which will come from quality improvements and 20 000 from additional capacity. The project also provides for a 20 000 bpd increase in jet fuel production capacity and a 12 000 bpd increase in Group II lubricating oil production.

The project also includes a dedicated bio jet fuel plant at the Boaventura Complex, with a production capacity of 19 000 bpd of renewable fuels, including hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF); and two gas-fired power plants at the complex, which will participate in capacity reserve auctions. The engineering project for the power plants has been approved, and the units will leverage synergies with the infrastructure of the Itaboraí Natural Gas Processing Unit (UPGN).

A lubricant oil re-refining project with a capacity of 30 000 m³/month (6300 bpd) is also under evaluation at Reduc. With the operation of the Boaventura Complex for Group II lubricant oil production, Reduc may repurpose existing units to re-refine used oil, applying the circular economy concept to generate high-value products from waste. The co-processing test has already been authorised by ANP and is expected to take place in 2025.

Decarbonisation at Reduc

Reduc has completed a test for producing the first jet fuel with renewable content (SAF) through co-processing, reaching up to 1.2% corn oil in jet fuel production. ANP authorisation has already been granted, and commercial production at Reduc is scheduled to begin in 2025, with a capacity of up to 50 000 m³/month (10 000 bpd).

Reduc already produces Diesel R5, with 5% renewable content, and has received ANP authorisation to begin testing a new 7% blend for Diesel R7 production. These initiatives reinforce Petrobras’ commitment to the decarbonisation of its products and the energy transition.

Petrobras plans to build a new thermal power plant at Reduc to replace obsolete steam and power generation equipment, with expected investments of R$860 million, enhancing reliability and bringing the refinery up to the highest international efficiency standards.

Investments of up to R$2.4 billion in maintenance shutdowns at Reduc are also planned from 2025 to 2029, to ensure the integrity, reliability, and safety of the facilities. Major shutdowns are scheduled for 2026 in the delayed coking and hydrotreatment units of the refinery.

Petrochemicals

In the petrochemical segment, a study for the production of acetic acid and monoethylene glycol (MEG) is under evaluation at the Boaventura Complex. Acetic acid is an important raw material for the production of paint, PET, and the broader chemical industry. Brazil currently imports its entire acetic acid demand and complements MEG demand with imports.

In addition to Petrobras’ projects in the region, Braskem, a Petrobras affiliate, is planning to expand its polyethylene plant, increasing the unit’s production capacity by up to 230 000 tpy. The project, which uses part of the natural gas processed at Route 3 of the Boaventura Complex, is budgeted at around R$4 billion and remains subject to the necessary approvals by Braskem’s governance bodies.",https://dlgivnpf6gg8w.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/brazil-02.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 12:15:15.081743

Introduction: From Pledge to Progress

Aviation is the lifeblood of global trade, tourism, and human connection. It links continents, underpins economic development, and powers globalization. Yet, it is also responsible for approximately 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions—an impact amplified by high-altitude contrails and nitrogen oxides that increase its total warming effect to nearly 3.5% of global warming. Unlike other sectors, aviation’s energy needs cannot be easily electrified or substituted. Long-haul aircraft require high energy density fuels that batteries and hydrogen cannot yet deliver efficiently or affordably.

That’s why Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is critical. SAF is the only near-term, scalable solution to cut aviation emissions. It’s a “drop-in” fuel that can be used in existing aircraft engines and fueling infrastructure. When derived from waste-based feedstocks like used cooking oil (UCO), animal fats, and agricultural residues, SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuel.

Yet despite this promise, SAF today accounts for less than 0.2% of global jet fuel consumption.

If we are to move the needle, the world must create conditions that accelerate SAF production, distribution, and consumption. That’s where ambitious SAF mandates come in—compulsory blend requirements set by governments to create market demand and trigger investment across the value chain.

This article explores:

The benefits of strong SAF mandates,

How SAF mandates are funded globally,

A detailed comparison between Singapore, the European Union (EU), and the United States (US),

And how Malaysia can craft its own strategic pathway toward SAF leadership in Southeast Asia.

Why SAF Mandates Matter: The Case for Regulatory Muscle

Markets do not scale sustainably without clear signals. In the context of SAF, voluntary uptake alone has not delivered the volume or consistency needed to meet the aviation sector’s climate goals. Without a mandate, airlines often defer SAF use due to cost premiums (2x–5x higher than fossil jet fuel), lack of infrastructure, or regulatory uncertainty.

Mandates change this by:

Creating predictable demand: Investors and refiners gain confidence that there will be buyers for their product.

Leveling the playing field: All airlines operating in a jurisdiction must comply, avoiding a first-mover penalty.

Driving innovation: Higher blend targets encourage new pathways, including power-to-liquid and advanced biofuels.

Building infrastructure: Airports and fuel suppliers are incentivized to upgrade logistics and blending capacity.

Generating transparency and accountability: With regulatory oversight comes traceability, monitoring, and reporting.

Mandates are not just a policy instrument—they are a market builder and a climate accelerator.

Singapore: Precision in Policy and Purpose

In 2024, Singapore became one of the first Southeast Asian nations to announce a SAF mandate. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) committed to a 1% SAF blending mandate at Changi Airport by 2026, with gradual increases envisioned toward 2030 and beyond.

At first glance, 1% may appear modest. But Singapore’s SAF strategy is anchored in pragmatism, infrastructure readiness, and coordinated funding.

Key Elements:

Voluntary ramp-up preceding the mandate: Pilot projects have already introduced SAF at Changi via airlines like Singapore Airlines and Scoot.

Price support via the CAAS Environmental Fund: The government will subsidize the price gap between SAF and fossil jet fuel for airlines.

Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs): Singapore actively collaborates with global SAF producers, logistics providers, and certification agencies.

Sustainability Certification: Feedstock must meet ISCC standards and align with ICAO’s CORSIA framework.

Funding Mechanism:

Government subsidies (direct support to airlines buying SAF),

Tax incentives for infrastructure investments (e.g., tanks, blending systems),

Private equity and VC mobilization via regulatory certainty.

Singapore’s approach is methodical and data-driven, aligning its SAF rollout with its Green Plan 2030, which includes carbon tax escalation and green finance reforms.

European Union: Regulation Meets Climate Ambition

No region has embraced SAF mandates with more vigor than the EU. In 2023, the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation was passed under the European Green Deal. It sets binding, escalating SAF blending targets for all EU airports and departing flights.

SAF Mandate Timeline:

2% by 2025

6% by 2030

20% by 2035

70% by 2050

1.2% synthetic fuels (e-fuels) by 2030

These are not suggestions—they are enforceable obligations with clear compliance mechanisms.

Policy Architecture:

Eligible Feedstocks: Only waste and residue-based inputs (e.g., UCO, animal fats, lignocellulosic biomass).

Certification: Mandatory ISCC-EU certification and alignment with RED II/III requirements.

Reporting: Airlines must submit verified SAF usage data annually.

Penalties:

Financial fines for non-compliance,

Market exclusion for non-conforming SAF producers.

Funding Support:

EU Innovation Fund: €10 billion available through 2030 for climate technologies including SAF production.

National subsidies: France, Germany, and the Netherlands offer SAF-specific grants.

EU ETS incentives: Airlines using SAF receive fewer emissions obligations.

Contracts for Difference (CfD): In development to guarantee SAF offtake pricing.

What Makes the EU Model Work:

Regulatory backbone (mandates),

Financial stimulus (public grants),

Industrial policy alignment (Green Deal),

Clear signal to producers and investors.

United States: Incentives Over Mandates

The U.S. does not have a national SAF mandate. However, it leads the world in financial incentives, using carrots instead of sticks to drive SAF adoption.

Key Instruments:

Blender’s Tax Credit (BTC): Offers up to $1.75/gallon SAF used, depending on carbon intensity.

Inflation Reduction Act (IRA): Earmarks billions for biofuel and SAF infrastructure, valid through 2027.

California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS): SAF earns carbon credits, traded on open markets.

Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2): SAF producers earn Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs).

State-Level Support:

Illinois and Washington provide state tax credits,

Oregon offers low-carbon grants for airport blending infrastructure.

Additional Incentives:

Private sector momentum: United, Delta, JetBlue have signed multi-year SAF offtake agreements with startups.

USDA grants: Target feedstock innovation (algae, cover crops, municipal solid waste).

The U.S. model shows that subsidy-heavy frameworks, even without mandates, can catalyze early-stage market formation—especially in a risk-averse investment climate.

Malaysia’s SAF Opportunity: A Hybrid Model for a New Hub

Malaysia can—and should—draw upon global best practices to design a SAF mandate and funding model uniquely suited to its strengths:

Feedstock Abundance: Malaysia has a dense network of UCO, animal fats, and agricultural waste streams. FatHopes Energy’s decentralized collection system is already operational across the country.

Port & Trade Advantage: Located on the Straits of Malacca, Malaysia is strategically positioned to become a SAF export hub.

Refining Ambitions: FatHopes Energy is spearheading the development of Malaysia’s first commercial SAF refinery. This will be a beacon project for domestic consumption and international offtake.

Digital Traceability: Malaysia’s traceability infrastructure already meets ISCC and CORSIA requirements, allowing for fast-track certification.

Government Engagement: The National Energy Transition Roadmap and MyHIJAU initiatives offer a framework for embedding SAF into broader green growth plans.

What Malaysia Should Do:

Set a 1–2% blending mandate for KLIA and Subang by 2026, grow to 10% by 2030.

Create a SAF Producer Credit (like BTC) to lower entry barriers for refiners.

Launch a SAF Fund to subsidize airline purchases, modeled after CAAS.

Expand green tax incentives to cover SAF logistics, R&D, and export.

Embed SAF in ESG disclosure requirements for Malaysian public companies and GLCs.

Conclusion: From Policy to Progress

The SAF revolution is inevitable. The question is not if, but who will lead.

Mandates offer the clearest, fastest route to SAF scale-up. But they must be ambitious, enforced, and financially supported. Whether it’s Singapore’s precision, Europe’s regulation, or America’s incentives—the models show that different pathways can all drive impact, if underpinned by conviction.

Malaysia stands at the convergence point of feedstock potential, industrial capability, and geographic advantage. If we act now, we can go from being a feedstock exporter to a fuel exporter, from a green policy follower to a climate policy leader.

The version introduced on June 28, 2025, in the Senate would have required solar and wind projects to begin construction before the date of enactment, or they would be subject to a placed-in-service date of Dec. 31, 2027. Wind and solar projects beginning construction after June 16, 2025, would have been subject to the material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity requirements, as described below, and wind and solar projects that did not qualify for a credit or meet such requirements would have been subject to an excise tax.

Thanks to a last-minute deal from Sen. Murkowski of Alaska, the July 1, 2025, version of the bill passed by the Senate contained the same placed-in-service deadline for solar and wind projects, but only to the extent that they do not begin construction for tax purposes prior to 12 months after the date of enactment. This key provision allows solar and wind developers to safe harbor projects in 2025 and 2026 that will be placed in service in 2028, 2029 and 2030.

Additionally, the final bill adds no new limits on transferability, other than that credits cannot be transferred to prohibited foreign entities.

While the final version of the bill suggests that projects with planned placed-in-service dates in 2028, 2029 and 2030 can be safe harbored until 12 months after the President’s signature, clients should still consider beginning construction for projects with placed-in-service dates of 2028 or 2029 as soon as possible, since forthcoming IRS guidance that could affect the beginning of construction regime or related continuity safe harbor is possible.

McGuireWoods’ client alerts on the original version of the bill and the version passed by the House are available here and here.

A table summarizing the treatment of various credits under the final bill is below.

Beginning Construction

Despite favorable rules in the bill, McGuireWoods suggests that developers consider beginning construction on projects with a placed-in-service date of 2028 or 2029 as soon as possible.

Generally, the IRS recognizes two tests for a project to begin construction for tax purposes, the physical work test and the 5% safe harbor. Only one test must be satisfied to establish the beginning of construction. Once construction has begun, a taxpayer must make continuous efforts towards completion. Under a continuity safe harbor endorsed by the IRS, projects that begin construction in 2025 would have until the end of 2029 to be placed in service, and projects that begin construction in 2026 would have until the end of 2030 to be placed in service.

Under the physical work test, a taxpayer must perform physical work of a substantial nature on equipment that is an integral part of the facility. Off-site work must be performed pursuant to a binding written contract on components not normally held in the supplier’s inventory of the supplier that are critical to the project’s production of energy. For on-site work, work such as foundations uniquely designed to support electricity-generating equipment or other physical work of a substantial nature can establish the beginning of construction.

Under the 5% safe harbor, a taxpayer must, pursuant to a binding written contract, pay or incur at least 5% of the total cost of the facility and, for accrual-based taxpayers, take delivery of such components or expect to take delivery within 3.5 months of the execution of the binding written contract.

FEOC Rules

The bill would adopt a regime designed to stop credits claimed under 45Y, 48E, 45X, 45Q, 45Z and 45U from being claimed by or sold to certain prohibited foreign entities. For Section 45Y, 48E and 45X, this applies for credit claimed beginning Jan. 1, 2026. Additionally, (i) for Section 45Q, it applies beginning Jan. 1, 2026, and (ii) for Section 45Z and 45U, it applies beginning Jan. 1, 2026, in each case by determining if an entity is a prohibited foreign entity without regards to (b) and (c) under “foreign-influenced entity,” below.

Prohibited Foreign Entity: A specified foreign entity or a foreign-influenced entity.

Specified Foreign Entity: Foreign entities of concern, as described in the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act of FY 2021, include Chinese military companies operating in the United States, any entity on a list required by the strategy to enforce prohibition on imported goods made through forced labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region, an entity listed as ineligible for Department of Defense battery acquisition in the National Defense Authorization Act of FY 2024 or a foreign-controlled entity.

Foreign-Controlled Entity: Foreign-controlled entities include the government of a covered nation (the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea, the Republic of China, the Russian Federation and the Islamic Republic of Iran); a person who is a citizen, national or resident of a covered nation, provided the person is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident; an entity or qualified business unit incorporated or organized under the laws of or having its principal place of business in a covered nation; or an entity controlled by any of the listed foreign-controlled entities.

Foreign-Influenced Entity: Foreign-influenced entities are entities:

with respect to which, during the taxable year, (a) a specified foreign entity has the direct or indirect authority to appoint a covered officer, (b) a single specified foreign entity owns at least 25% of such entity, (c) one or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate at least 40% of such entity, or (d) at least 40% of the debt of such entity is held in the aggregate by one or more specified foreign entities;

which, during the previous taxable year, made a payment to a specified foreign entity pursuant to a contract, agreement or other arrangement which entitles such specified foreign entity to exercise control over a qualified facility or energy storage technology, including (a) determining the timing or production of electricity or an eligible component, (b) determining which entity may purchase or use the output of a project, (c) restrict access to data critical to the production of storage or energy or (d) repair or maintain the facility or energy storage technology on an exclusive basis; or

which is party to a licensing agreement with a specified foreign entity that entitles such specified foreign entity to exercise effective control over a qualified facility or energy storage technology or is longer than 10 years.

Material Assistance From a Prohibited Foreign Entity: Material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity is determined with respect to the “material cost ratio” of a qualified facility, energy storage technology or product line that produces eligible components. Generally, the material cost ratio for Sections 48E and 45Y is the portion of the cost of manufactured products, for 45X, is the cost of materials used to produce an eligible component, which come from sources other than prohibited foreign entities. The bill requires the IRS to issue safe harbor tables with respect to the cost of manufactured products and materials by Dec. 31, 2026, and states that until then, taxpayers may use the existing tables in IRS Notice 2025-08 to determine the cost of manufactured products and materials.

Additionally, the bill introduces new certification rules, but until the IRS issues guidance on these, taxpayers may rely on certifications from manufacturers or suppliers regarding the material cost ratio, provided that they do not rely on certifications they have reason to know are false. Existing contracts are exempt from the material assistance rules, provided that they were entered into prior to June 16, 2025, and relate to property that will be placed in service prior to Jan. 1, 2030.

A table summarizing the material cost ratios applicable under Sections 45Y, 48E and 45X is below:

Changes to Depreciation

The bill would eliminate (a) 5-year Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System depreciation for solar projects that do not qualify for a credit under Sections 48E or 45Y and (b) the energy-efficient commercial building deduction under Section 179D for projects beginning construction after June 30, 2026. Solar projects may still be able to utilize 100% bonus depreciation under Section 168(k).

Master Limited Partnerships

The bill would cause hydrogen storage, carbon capture, advanced nuclear, hydro-power and geothermal activities to constitute “qualifying income” under the master limited partnership tax regime. This provision creates an interesting regime that could pass tax credits through to master limited partnership investors and provide a method of raising capital for capital-intensive technologies. Additionally, this provision appears to be a boost to the oil and gas industry, which already uses the master limited partnership structure and could benefit from the inclusion of Section 45Q.",https://www.mcguirewoods.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/MW-social-media-icon.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 04:00:07.008035

By merging the Reduc refinery in Duque de Caxias with the Boaventura Energy Complex in Itaboraí, Petrobras aims to transform its refining and petrochemical operations into a cornerstone of the global low-carbon transition. This initiative not only enhances refining efficiency but also positions Petrobras as a leader in sustainable fuel production, all while aligning with President Lula's vision for industrial revitalization and economic growth in Rio de Janeiro's central corridor.

Strategic Advantages in Refining Efficiency

The integration's core objective is to maximize production of high-value fuels while minimizing emissions. By upgrading the Reduc refinery's hydrotreating and delayed coking units, Petrobras plans to boost S-10 diesel output by 76,000 barrels per day (bpd) and jet fuel capacity by 20,000 bpd. These upgrades leverage advanced hydrogen recovery systems, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by over 80% compared to older processes.

The project's focus on operational excellence is underscored by its modernization of the GasLub Complex, which will produce 12,000 bpd of high-grade lubricants by 2029. Meanwhile, a new R$860 million thermal power plant at Reduc will replace outdated equipment, enhancing energy efficiency and reliability.

Investors should note that these upgrades directly address Petrobras' GHG intensity target of 30 kg CO₂e per barrel by an unspecified year, a metric that could improve its ESG ratings and access to green financing.

Biofuel Production: A Catalyst for Low-Carbon Leadership

Decarbonization is central to the project's success. The Boaventura Complex's new Bio Jet Fuel plant will produce 19,000 bpd of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), leveraging renewable feedstocks like corn oil. Early trials at Reduc have already demonstrated the viability of co-processing SAF with 1.2% renewable content, with commercial production expected to hit 10,000 bpd by late 2025.

Petrobras' BioRefining Program further expands with the authorization to test Diesel R7—a 7% renewable-content diesel—expanding from the current 5% blend. With global BIOQAV (aviation bio-kerosene) demand projected to grow at 12% annually until 2030, these initiatives position Petrobras to capture premium pricing in high-margin biofuel markets.

The scalability of these projects is bolstered by Brazil's abundant agricultural feedstocks, offering a competitive advantage in cost-efficient biofuel production.

Synergies with Braskem: Petrochemical Growth and Circular Economy

The integration's petrochemical ambitions are equally compelling. Braskem, Petrobras' 47%-owned affiliate, is expanding its polyethylene plant capacity by 230,000 tons/year near Reduc, utilizing natural gas from Boaventura's Route 3. This synergy reduces feedstock costs and aligns with Petrobras' goal of reducing imports of critical chemicals like acetic acid and monoethylene glycol (MEG), both of which are 100% imported today.

Moreover, a proposed lubricant re-refining project at Reduc aims to process 30,000 m³/month of used oil, converting waste into high-value products. This circular economy approach not only cuts emissions but also creates new revenue streams from waste management—a model increasingly favored by global investors.

Aligning with Lula's Industrial Policy and Regional Growth

President Lula's administration has prioritized reviving Brazil's industrial base through strategic investments in energy and petrochemicals. The Reduc-Boaventura project directly supports this agenda by creating jobs in Rio de Janeiro's economically disadvantaged regions and reducing reliance on imported fuels and chemicals.

The project's total R$33 billion investment—split between Petrobras and Braskem—also signals long-term commitment to the region. With Brazil's ethanol subsidies and global sulfur standards evolving, the integration's flexibility in adapting to regulatory shifts further mitigates risks tied to compliance costs.

Investment Considerations and Risks

While the project's scale and alignment with global decarbonization trends are compelling, risks remain. Execution delays or cost overruns could strain Petrobras' capital allocation, particularly with R$2.4 billion earmarked for maintenance shutdowns through 2029. Additionally, regulatory hurdles—such as delays in ANP approvals for new biofuel blends—could slow revenue generation.

However, the project's early milestones, such as the REPLAN hydrotreating unit's completion in May 2024, suggest strong execution capability. For investors, Petrobras' exposure to rising biofuel demand and its leadership in low-carbon refining make it a compelling long-term play.

The company's target of $2.1 billion EBITDA growth by 2028—driven by efficiency gains and premium biofuel sales—supports a ""Buy"" rating for investors with a multi-year horizon.

Conclusion

The Reduc-Boaventura Integration is more than a refinery upgrade—it's a strategic blueprint for Petrobras to dominate the low-carbon energy transition. By enhancing refining efficiency, scaling biofuel production, and leveraging synergies with Braskem, the project creates a robust platform for value creation. Combined with Brazil's industrial policy priorities and the global shift toward sustainable fuels, Petrobras is poised to transform itself into a leader in the new energy economy. For investors, this is a rare opportunity to back a company at the intersection of decarbonization, regional development, and long-term profitability.",,N,,2025-07-04 01:59:12.934374

The platform will help connect airlines and SAF producers by matching requests for SAF supply with offers. When there is a match, airlines and suppliers can connect and take their negotiation offline to agree on specific terms including price and payment terms.

IATA hopes that the platform will address three main issues:

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. It will therefore facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes while airlines are able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes. Subsequent trades will take place outside the platform.

Visibility: The platform carries comprehensive information regarding the available SAF, such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

IATA Director General Willie Walsh expressed his frustration with the current process earlier this year, describing the actions of some fuel suppliers as ‘profiteering’.

Referring to the EU mandate which is for airlines to mix 2% SAF in the jet fuel supply, Walsh pointed out that this had “…raised costs but not production.” He went on to say “It’s an outrage that suppliers are charging airlines compliance fees that value SAF at double its market premium over conventional jet fuel. That’s a billion-dollar windfall for fuel suppliers. This is the EU great green scam.”

About the launch of the SAF Matchmaker Platform, Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist said:

“To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market. The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF. The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers,”.

The SAF Matchmaker supports spot purchases as well as offtake agreements and is initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers only. In due course, other SAF buyers such as non-aviation corporations will also be able to participate.

The complete Flight Emissions Review with full rankings, regional analysis, is available at cirium.com","Global aviation analytics firm, Cirium has launched a new Flight Emissions Review which ranks airlines globally for fuel burn and overall emissions.

Cirium’s EmeraldSky is a new methodology which the company claims is the industry’s most precise independent standard for measuring both aircraft emissions and fuel burn. The system has achieved ISAE 3000 Reasonable Assurance from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and official accreditation from the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI).

The data has Wizz Air topping the table for efficiency with the lowest emissions intensity for last year when ranking the world’s 100 largest airlines by capacity. Wizz Air emits an industry low of 53.9 grams of CO₂ per Available Seat Kilometre (ASK) compared to a global average of 74.8. The airline has achieved this through a combination of high seat density on its aircraft, and newer fleets.

In the US, American low-cost carrier Frontier Airlines came second, emitting 54.4 grams, while Turkish carrier Pegasus came third with 57.1 grams.

In addition to Wizz Air and Pegasus, a further four European airlines made the global top 20, namely SunExpress (9th), Transavia (13th), Aegean Airlines (16th), Ryanair (20th).

Cirium’s report also ranked the ten largest airlines in the world by ASK. At the head of the table was Ryanair, emitting 63 grams of CO₂ per ASK, followed by Southwest Airlines, and Delta Air Lines.

The top 20 major airlines globally are pictured below:

Mike Malik, chief marketing officer of Cirium said that “what makes this data both encouraging and sobering [is that] while these airlines excel at reduced emissions intensity, total emissions continue rising with demand growth. Even the most efficient operators can’t offset demand growth through operational improvements alone yet.”

Malik added that:

“The data confirms what many in the industry suspected: seat density and fleet age matter more than almost any other factor airlines can control. While industry leaders are succeeding through these operational strategies, it also highlights how limited the levers for emissions reduction really are compared to the scale of the challenge.”

The new methodology does not currently factor in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into its analysis. Cirum points out that “…current production covers only 0.53% of fuel demand and scaling requires massive infrastructure investment and years of development. Until airlines have consistent access to meaningful volumes, operational efficiency remains the primary lever they can pull today.”

The emissions calculations are built on a multi-layered data integration approach that combines several data sources:

Flight Operations Data: The system ingests actual flight tracking data, including gate and runway departure and arrival times. This real-world operational data replaces the theoretical great circle distance calculations used by many existing tools.

Aircraft Performance Models: The system incorporates detailed aircraft-specific fuel consumption models that account for individual aircraft characteristics, engine types, and configuration variables. These models consider factors such as aircraft age and operational weight that significantly impact fuel burn rates.

Operational Context Integration: The system accounts for operational factors such as taxi times, ground delays, air traffic control routing changes, and holding patterns that contribute to taxi/ flight times and therefore total flight emissions but are often excluded from simplified calculation methods.

Real-Time Data Processing: EmeraldSky processes this multi-source data through advanced algorithms that weight and correlate different variables to produce fuel consumption estimates. The system then applies standardised emissions factors to convert fuel burn data into CO₂.

Validation and Calibration: The platform continuously validates its calculations against actual reported fuel consumption data where available, using machine learning techniques to refine its models and improve accuracy over time.

That includes the green hydrogen industry, which is finding a place for itself in global food systems as producers scout for more sustainable alternatives to petrochemical fertilizers.

New Green Hydrogen Project Targets Green Ammonia

The latest news about sustainable fertilizer comes from the UK-listed firm ATOME. The company is planning to construct a new, $630 million USD fertilizer facility in Paraguay, which will deploy green hydrogen to produce ammonia-based fertilizer.

“Due to traditional fossil-fuel production methods, the fertiliser industry emits 2.6 billion tonnes of CO₂ per year – more than the shipping and aviation sectors combined,” ATOME notes, by way of explaining why a shift into green hydrogen is needed.

If you’re wondering how green hydrogen comes into the fertilizer equation, that’s a good question. Producing ammonia fertilizer requires a copious amount of hydrogen along with nitrogen (the chemical symbol for ammonia is NH3). In the conventional ammonia-based fertilizer industry, the supply chain lands on hydrogen extracted from natural gas or coal. The green hydrogen industry presents a more sustainable alternative.

ATOME plans to produce calcium ammonium nitrate fertilizer at the new facility, with green hydrogen providing a fossil-free source of ammonia. Electricity from the hydropower facility will run electrolysis equipment, which jolts hydrogen gas loose from water. “Our process virtually eliminates harmful emissions at the point of production which leads to the displacement of up to 12.5 million tonnes of CO2 – from just one of our projects!” ATOME enthuses.

Green Hydrogen: Follow The Money

Stakeholders in the alternative hydrogen space have also explored bio-based and waste-based pathways to push virgin fossil sources out of the way of the hydrogen supply chain, but most of the investor money is currently focused on water electrolysis.

ATOME comes into the picture flush with cash and a string of well heeled industry collaborators including Yara, Hy24, AECOM, Natixis, IDB Invest, and ANDE among others. Earlier this year ATOME tapped Hy24 for up to $115 million USD to serve as anchor and lead equity investor for the Paraguay project.

Another major milestone occurred in April, when ATOME put up a lump sum of $465 million to engage the global engineering firm Casale to take the lead on EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) for the Paraguay fertilizer project. Located in Villeta, the new facility is expected to produce 260,000 tonnes (about 286,600 US tons) of fertilizer for markets in the Mercosur region. If all goes according to plan, Casale will begin construction later this summer and the facility will be up and running in time for sales to begin in 2028.

“Once constructed, the Villeta Project will service a developed and ready market in the heart of the largest food-producing region in the world, meeting critical demand for low-carbon fertilisers from the agriculture and food sectors,” Casale noted in a press release last April.

Casale CEO Federico Zardi also emphasized that his firm has been transitioning its traditional business into a low-carbon model for the past 10 years or so, enabling it to apply a considerable base of knowledge to the ATOME project.

“Through these technological advancements, we are delivering an extremely optimized design at Villeta, setting a precedent for sustainable fertiliser production at costs that are competitive with, or even lower than, conventional ‘grey’ fertilisers, paving the way to a sustainable agricultural future,” Zardi emphasized.

Follow More Money To Green Hydrogen

If you caught that thing about “competitive with, or even lower than, conventional ‘grey’ fertilisers,” that represents a sea change for the green hydrogen industry. Leading up to today, green hydrogen has struggled to compete on cost against the fossil energy supply chain. However, the script is beginning to flip. In addition to system optimization, the cost of electrolysis equipment has come down. Access to low-cost renewable energy also plays a role, as does qualification for public subsidies. ATOME notes that the Villeta project is located in a tax-free zone, for example.

Another downward driver of costs is favorable financing, for which the new fertilizer project also qualifies. Earlier this week the ATOME team contacted CleanTechnica by email with news that the project has just been approved for $50 million USD in concessional financing from the Green Climate Fund. Concessional provides more favorable terms than conventional, market-available financing.

“The concessional finance reduces the Project’s cost of capital and supports market competitiveness,” ATOME noted.

“This highly competitive funding, alongside competitive senior debt support from leading multilateral development institutions, will meaningfully lower the overall cost of capital, ATOME CEO Olivier Mussat emphasized in a press statement.

“By enhancing the value of the equity component, it importantly enhances the bankability and value of the Project equity and will assist in optimising returns for ATOME’s shareholders,” Mussat emphasized again for good measure.

A feature of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change,the Green Climate Fund bills itself the largest climate fund in the world. It provides financial support to developing countries in pursuit of their decarbonization goals under the Paris Agreement. The $50 million in financing for the fertilizer project will be administered through the International Finance Corporation branch of the World Bank Group.

Meanwhile, Here In The US …

ATOME anticipates that the seal of approval from GCF will provide a shot of adrenaline to the green hydrogen industry beyond the Villeta project. “GCF views the Project as a large-scale catalytic step towards decarbonising fertiliser production across South America and importantly will contribute to the sustainability, affordability and security of the food supply chain,” the company notes.

Meanwhile, here in the US, the green hydrogen industry already got a shot of adrenaline a couple of years ago, from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The BIL carved out $7 billion to support the creation of new regional hydrogen hubs, leveraging the distinctive natural, infrastructural, and economical resources of different parts of the US.

The BIL also included a further carveout requiring natural gas to be represented in the program, but most of the emphasis was on green hydrogen produced from water or biomass with renewable energy.

That’s “was” as in “probably not gonna happen after all.” On May 30, Energy Secretary Chris Wright (this guy) canceled 24 clean energy programs totaling $3.7 billion, some of which were related to clean hydrogen.

That doesn’t necessarily mean the end of green hydrogen in the US. In Iowa, a modestly scaled, solar-enabled green hydrogen-to-fertilizer project is providing farmers with access to locally produced, carbon-free ammonia fertilizer.

On the larger end of the scale, keep an eye on Texas. BloombergNEF recently identified Texas as one of the few regional markets where green hydrogen has the potential to gain a competitive edge, and the global sustainable aviation fuel movement is providing green hydrogen stakeholders with a lifeline.

CORSIA is a global mechanism for reducing and offsetting carbon emissions from international flights, backed by the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization.
ICAO's statistics showed that the scheme has already covered about 60% of total international aviation CO2 emissions.
However, some large developing countries, like China, India and Brazil, have not yet committed to joining CORSIA.
""This is a substantial figure, especially as many Vietnamese airlines are recovering post-pandemic and facing intense competition,"" the government statement said.","The Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam has officially committed to participating in the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation from Jan. 1, 2026, according to a Vietnamese government statement released on July 2.

CORSIA is a global mechanism for reducing and offsetting carbon emissions from international flights, backed by the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization. Under CORSIA's framework, airlines need to offset any growth in CO2 emissions above 85% of 2019 levels. As such, this mechanism has been widely seen as a key stimulus of carbon credit demand.

ICAO's statistics showed that the scheme has already covered about 60% of total international aviation CO2 emissions. However, some large developing countries, like China, India and Brazil, have not yet committed to joining CORSIA. Vietnam's latest announcement sent an encouraging signal to indicate a higher level of readiness of developing countries.

The Vietnamese government said this move also marks a significant stride in the green transition roadmap for Vietnam's aviation sector, while also posing a considerable challenge for domestic airlines, according to the statement.

The ICAO on June 30 confirmed the registration of CAAV, an agency under Vietnam's Ministry of Construction, to participate in the voluntary phase of CORSIA commencing from Jan. 1, 2026, the Vietnamese government statement said.

CAAV SAID Vietnam has undertaken numerous preparatory steps for participation. The construction ministry has issued a circular regulating the management of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions in civil aviation activities. CAAV has also implemented a monitoring-reporting-verification system for airline emissions and submitted international emissions data reports to ICAO for 2019-2024, the statement said.

In addition, CAAV has studied policies related to sustainable development from ICAO and the EU and organized various meetings with stakeholders to assess impacts and develop appropriate solutions for the CORSIA participation, according to the statement.

Financial impacts

However, CAAV warned that domestic airlines will face significant financial pressure due to the CORSIA participation. It is projected that the cost of purchasing carbon credits during the voluntary phase could range from $13 million to $92 million, depending on the market price of credits, which vary between $6 and $40/mtCO2e.

""This is a substantial figure, especially as many Vietnamese airlines are recovering post-pandemic and facing intense competition,"" the government statement said.

The CORSIA mechanism is structured in three main phases.

The Pilot Phase (2021-2023) applies to states that choose to participate voluntarily, followed by Phase 1 (2024-2026), which also remains voluntary. Phase 2 (2027-2035), however, becomes mandatory for states whose international aviation activities accounted for more than 0.5% of global revenue ton-kilometers based on 2018 data.

Least Developed Countries, Small Island Developing States, and Landlocked Developing Countries are exempt from this obligation unless they choose to participate voluntarily, according to ICAO.

CAAV will continue to coordinate closely with the airlines and relevant agencies in the future to standardize policy proposals and deliver financial and technical support mechanisms, helping aviation enterprises effectively adapt to CORSIA's new requirements, the statement said.

Binh Son Refining and Petrochemical Joint Stock Company, operator of the 130,000 b/d refinery at Dung Quat, in March signed a consulting contract with Kellogg Brown & Root for a pre-feasibility study on sustainable aviation fuel. The contract will grant BSR access to advanced technologies and technical solutions for energy transition and carbon emission reduction while also creating opportunities to facilitate its investments in new energy and sustainable aviation projects.

National carrier Vietnam Airlines successfully conducted the first flight using SAF from Singapore to Hanoi on May 27, 2024, the government said in a statement in May last year.

An earlier Senate version of the BBB would have denied the zero-emission nuclear power production credit under IRC § 45U if nuclear fuel imported from China, Russia, Iran or North Korea was used for electricity production from a facility (subject to an exception for binding contracts in effect before January 1, 2023). Such prohibition represented an extension of the various foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions imposed on renewable energy projects under the BBB. While the FEOC restrictions largely remain intact in the final version of the BBB, the prohibition of use of imported nuclear fuel under IRC § 45U has been removed.

New Excise Tax. A surprise addition to the earlier Senate version of the BBB was a new excise tax applicable to wind and solar projects that violate the material assistance rules, which generally are intended to limit the use of materials obtained from persons or entities with ties to China, Russia, Iran or North Korea (“prohibited foreign entities”). Very generally, prohibited foreign entities include “specified foreign entities” (SPEs) and “foreign influence entities” (FIEs), with a SPE including a foreign entity of concern or other entity or person with ties to Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, and a FIE generally including (i) an entity in which SPEs hold significant ownership interests or possess the ability to appoint directors or key executives or (ii) an entity that made certain sizable payments to SPEs during the previous taxable year. As drafted, the new tax would have been imposed on project equipment based on the degree to which a project exceeds material assistance cost ratios for materials sourced from prohibited foreign entities, up to 50% for wind projects and 30% for solar projects, and would have applied to wind and solar projects which either (i) begin construction after December 31, 2027, and before January 1, 2036, or (ii) begin construction after the date of enactment and before January 1, 2028, and are placed in service after December 31, 2027. The excise tax proposal, described by industry participants as potentially being the death knell for wind and solar projects, was excluded from the final version of the BBB.

Renewable Fuel. The BBB contains several key changes to the clean fuel production credit under IRC § 45Z, which provides a tax credit for the production of low-carbon-intensity transportation fuels. Most notably, the BBB extends the IRC § 45Z credit through the end of 2029. (The credit was originally due to expire in 2027.) Beginning in 2026, IRC § 45Z will only be available for fuel produced from feedstocks produced in the United States, Mexico and Canada. The BBB now caps the value of the IRC § 45Z credit at $1.00 per gallon (including for sustainable aviation fuel) except in the case of fuel produced from animal manure (e.g., renewable natural gas) for which the Treasury may provide for a credit value in excess of $1.00 per gallon depending upon the emissions rate of the fuel. These changes provide some additional stability for the renewable fuels market generally but will cause some disruption in the sustainable aviation fuel and imported feedstock markets.

Hydrogen. The BBB sunsets the clean hydrogen production credit under IRC § 45V for hydrogen projects that have not yet commenced by December 31, 2027. This is five years earlier than had been originally provided under the IRA.

This strategic partnership is expected to help the UK’s flagship carrier reduce lifecycle carbon emissions of approximately 400,000 metric tons, compared with use of the same volume of conventional jet fuel. This reduction is equivalent to the total emissions of flying ~ 240,000 economy class passengers on return flights between London and New York.

As part of its sustainability roadmap, British Airways has committed to powering 10% of its flights with SAF by 2030 (the UK government has since set a SAF Mandate). EcoCeres will provide SAF produced from 100% waste-based biomass feedstock, such as used cooking oil (UCO). This SAF has the potential to provide a lifecycle carbon reduction of up to 80% compared to the traditional jet fuel it replaces.

Matti Lievonen, CEO of EcoCeres, stated, “We are proud to partner with British Airways in this strategic agreement to jointly tackle greenhouse gas emissions in aviation. Our commitment to sustainability is unwavering, and this partnership exemplifies our dedication to providing innovative fuel solutions that will help the aviation industry meet its environmental targets. Together, we are contributing to the broader effort of reducing emissions in transportation.”

Carrie Harris, Director of Sustainability at British Airways, added, “At British Airways, we see SAF as an important part of our BA Better World strategy. In 2024 alone, SAF accounted for 2.7% of British Airways’ total fuel use and is contributing to our achievement of a 13% reduction in our carbon intensity since 2019. That’s why this new agreement with EcoCeres is so exciting - it's another important step forward on our journey to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.”

The following statement can be attributed to David Fialkov, Executive Vice President of Government Affairs for NATSO and SIGMA.

""We thank the Trump Administration and Congressional Leaders for advancing a strong tax reform package that advances our nation's economic and energy goals while supporting the fuel retail and travel center industries through a competitive tax environment and technology-neutral biofuels policies.""

""This legislation marks a major victory for the nation's fuel retailers, their employees and the communities in which they operate. We applaud the inclusion of key tax provisions, such as the 199A Qualified Business Income Deduction and the full expensing of capital investments, which help spur innovation in our competitive marketplace.""

""NATSO and SIGMA, which together represent nearly 90 percent of fuel sold at retail, strongly support the revision to the '45Z' Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit, which restores equal tax treatment between sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other advanced biofuels such as biodiesel and renewable diesel. Modifying '45Z' to be technology-neutral marks a critical step in revitalizing U.S. biofuel production.

""Incentivizing SAF at the same tax rate as all other biofuels will result in more gallons of biofuel being produced and consumed at a lower cost to taxpayers.""

In addition to Petrobras’ projects in the region, Braskem, a Petrobras affiliate, is planning to expand its polyethylene plant, increasing the unit’s production capacity by up to 230 thousand tons per year.","Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. – Petrobras announces that approximately R$33 billion in investments are planned for refining and petrochemical projects in Rio de Janeiro, of which R$29 billion in Petrobras Capex and R$4 billion in another project that operates in synergy with Petrobras assets.

The implementation of the integration projects of the Boaventura Energy Complex (Itaboraí – RJ) and Reduc (Duque de Caxias – RJ) involves an estimated investment of R$26 billion. This amount is included in the 2025-2029 Business Plan (PN 2025-2029), and service packages for the projects are currently in the bidding phase.

This new structure will increase S-10 diesel production by 76 thousand barrels per day (bpd), 56 thousand of which from quality improvements and 20 thousand from additional capacity. The project also provides for a 20 thousand bpd increase in jet fuel production capacity and a 12 thousand bpd increase in Group II lubricating oil production.

The project also includes a dedicated Bio Jet Fuel plant at the Boaventura Complex, with a production capacity of 19 thousand bpd of renewable fuels (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil – HVO and Sustainable Aviation Fuel – SAF); and two gas-fired power plants at the Boaventura Complex, which will participate in capacity reserve auctions. The engineering project for the power plants has been approved, and the units will leverage synergies with the infrastructure of the Itaboraí Natural Gas Processing Unit (UPGN).

A lubricant oil re-refining project with a capacity of 30 thousand m³/month (6.3 thousand bpd) is also under evaluation at Reduc. With the operation of the Boaventura Complex for Group II lubricant oil production, Reduc may repurpose existing units to re-refine used oil, applying the circular economy concept to generate high-value products from waste. The co-processing test has already been authorized by ANP and is expected to take place this year.

Decarbonization at Reduc

Reduc has successfully completed a test for producing the first jet fuel with renewable content (SAF) through co-processing, reaching up to 1.2% corn oil in jet fuel production. ANP authorization has already been granted, and commercial production at Reduc is scheduled to begin in the next few months, with a capacity of up to 50 thousand m³/month (10 thousand bpd).

Reduc already produces Diesel R5, with 5% renewable content, and has received ANP authorization to begin testing a new 7% blend for Diesel R7 production. These initiatives reinforce Petrobras’ commitment to the decarbonization of its products and the just energy transition.

With a focus on modernization and energy efficiency, Petrobras plans to build a new thermal power plant at Reduc to replace obsolete steam and power generation equipment, with expected investments of R$860 million, enhancing reliability and bringing the refinery up to the highest international efficiency standards.

Investments of up to R$2.4 billion in maintenance shutdowns at Reduc are also planned from 2025 to 2029, to ensure the integrity, reliability, and safety of the facilities. Major shutdowns are scheduled for 2026 in the delayed coking and hydrotreatment units of the refinery.

Petrochemicals

In the petrochemical segment, a study for the production of acetic acid and monoethylene glycol (MEG) is under evaluation at the Boaventura Complex. Acetic acid is an important raw material for the production of paint, PET, and the broader chemical industry. Brazil currently imports its entire acetic acid demand and complements MEG demand with imports.

In addition to Petrobras’ projects in the region, Braskem, a Petrobras affiliate, is planning to expand its polyethylene plant, increasing the unit’s production capacity by up to 230 thousand tons per year. The project, which uses part of the natural gas processed at Route 3 of the Boaventura Complex, is budgeted at around R$4 billion and remains subject to the necessary approvals by Braskem’s governance bodies.",https://brazilenergyinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/boaventura.webp,N,,2025-07-03 19:03:24.585110

Applies to credits disallowed due to FEOC or foreign-sourcing restrictions

Sec. 6695B

Substantial misstatements on certifications provided by suppliers:

New proposed penalty that targets suppliers or manufacturers who issue false certifications regarding domestic content or foreign sourcing

Applies to certifications provided after Dec. 31, 2025

Greater of $5,000 or 10% of credit amount claimed by the taxpayer relying on the misstated certification

Observation: Projects seeking tax credits under sections 45 and 48 are generally unaffected by the bill, except as described below with respect to the termination of 2% energy credit. To be eligible for tax credits under sections 45 or 48, a project (except for ground or groundwater thermal systems, as described below) must have begun construction before Jan. 1, 2025, and generally be placed in service within 4 years (or 10 years in the case of offshore wind) after in year in which construction begun.

§168 – Accelerated Cost Recovery System (Depreciation)

Section 45Y and 48E property would continue to be listed as 5-year MACRS property under section 168.

Property that would be ""energy property"" as defined in section 48 would no longer be listed as 5-year MACRS property under Section 168.

Observation: Without a specific indication to the contrary, there are arguments that such property would continue to be subject to the MACRS rules/guidance, which include general rules regarding the determination of MACRS class lives (such as Rev. Proc. 87-56).

Alternatively, taxpayers would appear to be able to elect the alternative depreciation system and apply 12-year, straight-line recovery under section 168(g).

45Y – Clean Electricity Production Credit & §48E – Clean Electricity Investment Credit

Placed in Service Deadline for Wind and Solar: Credits would terminate for wind and solar facilities that begin construction after 1 year from enactment and are not placed in service before Jan. 1, 2028—facilities that begin construction within 1 year from enactment would not be subject to the placed in service deadline.

Phase-Out for other technologies: All technology other than wind and solar would phase out after 2032 as follows:

100% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2033;

75% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2034;

50% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2035; and

0% credit for facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2035.

Observation: The version of the bill that initially passed the House included deadlines based on beginning construction (within 60 days of enactment) and being placed in service (by Dec. 31, 2028). The Senate Finance Committee's version of the bill included a modified phaseout for wind and solar based on beginning construction by Dec. 31, 2027, however that proposal was then replaced with a placed in service deadline of Dec. 31, 2027 for projects beginning construction one year after enactment.

Observation: The accelerated timeline for wind and solar projects to be placed in service (as compared to the phase out for other technologies) presents additional challenges for developers faced with construction and supply uncertainty and potential inability to control the timing for when their facilities can be placed in service.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after enactment;

Taxpayers whose facilities are determined to be under ""effective control"" by a ""specified foreign entity"" in tax years beginning after enactment; and

Facilities that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2025, and include ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"".

Observation: Requiring that ""effective control"" be ""determined"", in this context, implies that the determination will be made during post-filing examination and enforcement.

Special ITC Recapture Rule: 100% of ITCs claimed under section 48E with respect to a property would be recaptured if a ""specified taxpayer"" (i.e., one who is allowed an ITC for any tax year beginning 2 years after enactment) makes an ""applicable payment"" within 10 years after the property is placed in service.

Transferability would continue to be available for the duration of the credit period.

Special Rule for Residential Property: No credit would be allowed for residential solar water heating property or small wind energy property if the taxpayer/owner rents or leases such property to a third party.

Observation: Projects subject to PPAs and other property (such as battery storage projects) apparently would not be subject to the rule above.

Observation: Under the bill, residential solar electric property would not be subject to the rule above. Therefore, residential solar electric property leased to customers would still be eligible for section 45Y or 48E credits provided that other credit eligibility requirements are satisfied.

Observation: Residential projects that can demonstrate that they began construction in 2024 would qualify for the ITC under section 48.

Nuclear Energy Communities: Advanced nuclear facilities located in a metropolitan statistical area that has (or at any time after Dec. 31, 2009 has had) 0.17% of greater direct employment related to advanced nuclear power would be eligible for the energy community bonus credit amount for PTCs under section 45Y (but not for ITCs under section 48E).

Correction to Domestic Content Percentages Under 48E: The domestic content applicable percentage under 48E for qualified facilities and energy storage technology would be revised to match current 45Y as follows:

40% (or 20% for offshore wind) if construction begins before June 16, 2025;

45% (or 27.5% for offshore wind) if construction begins after June 16, 2025, and before Jan. 1, 2026;

50% (or 35% for offshore wind) if construction begins during 2026; and

55% if construction begins after Dec. 31, 2026.

Special Rules for Fuel Cell Property: For qualified fuel cell property that begins construction after Dec. 31, 2025, the credit rate would be fixed at 30% and could not be increased or otherwise adjusted, and the zero GHG emissions requirement and recapture rule for GHG emissions greater than 10 grams of C02e per KWh would not apply.

Observation: The fixed 30% ITC rate for fuel cell property suggests that PWA compliance would no longer be necessary to qualify for the full ITC rate, however the ITC rate could not be increased through bonus credit amounts for energy community or domestic content or otherwise.

§45Q – Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit

Parity of Credit Rate: For facilities placed in service after enactment, the credit amount would be the same regardless of whether the taxpayer merely disposed of the captured carbon oxide or undertakes use or utilization of the captured carbon oxide, as follows:

$17 ($36 for direct air capture) for tax years beginning in a calendar year after 2024 and before 2027 (indexed for 2025-inflation for any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2026)

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after enactment.

§45U – Clean Electricity Production (For Existing Nuclear Facilities)

The credit would terminate for electricity produced and sold after Dec. 31, 2032.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment;

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment; and

Transferability would continue to be available for the duration of the credit period.

§45V – Clean Hydrogen Production Credit

This credit would be terminated for facilities that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2027.

Observation: The FEOC restrictions apparently would not apply to section 45V.

§45X – Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit

Except as noted below, the credit rate would phase out under the current schedule based on the date the eligible components are sold:

Before Jan. 1, 2030: 100%;

During 2030: 75%;

During 2031: 50%;

During 2032: 25%;

After Dec. 31, 2032: 0%.

Wind energy components produced and sold after December 31, 2027, would not be credit eligible.

For critical minerals other than metallurgical coal, the credit rate would phase out as follows based on the date the critical minerals are produced:

Before Jan. 1, 2031: 100%;

During 2031: 75%;

During 2032: 50%;

During 2033: 25%;

After Dec. 31, 2033: 0%.

Inclusion of Metallurgical Coal as a Critical Mineral: Metallurgical coal that is suitable for use in the production of steel (within the meaning of the Department of Energy notice ""Critical Mineral List; Addition of Metallurgical Coal Used for Steelmaking"" (90 Fed. Reg. 22711 (May 29, 2025))) would be credit-eligible at a rate of 2.5% of the costs incurred by the taxpayer with respect to production, regardless of whether such production occurs inside or outside of the United States.

Metallurgical coal produced after Dec. 31, 2029, would not be credit eligible.

Observation: Under section 45X(d)(2) (not modified by the bill), sales are taken into account for section 45X credits only when production of eligible components is within the United States (or its possession). It remains to be seen whether this provision effectively requires the production of metallurgical coal to be within the United States to be credit-eligible.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after enactment;

Taxpayers who are determined to have produced eligible components through ""effective control"" by a ""specified foreign entity"" in tax years beginning after enactment; and

Eligible components produced in tax years beginning after enactment that include any ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"".

Additional Requirement for Battery Modules: To be credit-eligible, battery modules would be required to be comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.

Sale of Integrated Components: For tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2026, sales of integrated components would remain credit-eligible only if the ""primary component"" is integrated, incorporated, or assembled into a ""secondary component"" (i) that is produced within the same manufacturing facility as the primary component, (ii) that is sold to an unrelated person, and (iii) for which not less than 65% of the total direct material costs are attributable to primary components which are mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.

Observation: Taxpayers could still elect to treat a sale of components to a related person as being made to an unrelated person.

§45Z – Clean Fuel Production Credit

The credit period would be extended until Dec. 31, 2029 (based on when the fuel is sold).

Fuel produced after December 31, 2025, would be required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

Transportation fuel emissions rates published after Dec. 31, 2025, could not be less than zero.

Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions would exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land use charge, and distinct emissions rates would be provided for transportation fuels derived from animal manure, including dairy, swine, and poultry.

Prevention of Double Credit: fuel produced from a fuel that generated a credit under section 45Z would not be credit eligible, and Treasury would be authorized to issue guidance on preventing the doubling of 45Z credits.

Sales to Unrelated Persons: Treasury would be authorized to prescribe rules for related persons whom the taxpayer has reason to believe will sell fuel to an unrelated person.

Special Rules for Sustainable Aviation Fuel:

For fuel sold or used on or after enactment (and fuel sold or used before enactment that have not yet been allowed or paid a credit under section 6426(k)), the sustainable aviation fuel credit under section 6426(k) would not be allowed for any gallon of fuel that could receive a credit under section 45Z.

For fuel produced after Dec. 31, 2025, the increased credit rate for SAF would not apply.

The sustainable aviation fuel credit under section 6426(k) would not apply to any sale or use for any period after September 30, 2025.

Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit: For fuel sold or used after June 30, 2025:

The small agri-biodiesel producer credit under section 40A would be extended to sale or use on or before Dec. 31, 2026;

The credit amount would be increased from $0.10 to $0.20 per gallon of qualified agri-biodiesel production, and would be in addition to any credit determined under section 45Z with respect to such gallon of fuel;

The small agri-biodiesel producer credit could be transferred pursuant to section 6418; and

Eligible small agri-biodiesel producers would be required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment; and

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning 2 years after enactment.

§48 – Energy Credit

The 2% energy credit would terminate for any energy property beginning construction after June 16, 2025.

Observation: For projects beginning construction on or after Jan. 1, 2025, only ground or groundwater thermal systems remain eligible for the 6% energy credit, because other energy property eligible for a 6% energy credit (including fuel cells, solar, geothermal, small wind property, waste energy recovery property, energy storage technology, biogas property, microgrid controllers, and combined heat and power property) converted to the ""tech-neutral"" ITC under section 48E.

§48C – Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit

Upon enactment, allocations revoked for failure to place the project in service within 2 years from the date of certification would not be restored to the total amount of allocations under the program.

§6418 – Transfer of Certain Credits

The bill does not include a deadline with respect to the transfer of credits; however, transfers of credits under 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z, or 48E to a ""specified foreign entity"" would be prohibited.

Observation: The preservation of transferability is undermined by the accelerated expiration of the credits themselves.

Observation: Additional FEOC requirements would apply to credits under sections 45Y,48E, and 45X that would not apply to credits under sections 45U, 45Q, 45Z, and 48.

FEOC Restrictions:

A ""prohibited foreign entity"" is either (i) a specified foreign entity or (ii) a foreign-influenced entity.

""Specified foreign entities"" include:

entities designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the Secretary of State;17

entities included on the specially designated nationals and blocked persons list maintained by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control;18

entities alleged by the Attorney General to have engaged in conduct for which a conviction was obtained under certain laws;

entities determined by the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence, to be engaged in unauthorized conduct that is detrimental to U.S national security or foreign policy;19

Chinese military company operating in the United States;20

entities Listed Under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act21; or

certain battery producing entities.22

Specified foreign entities include ""foreign controlled entities"" such as (i) the government of a covered nation (e.g., China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea), (ii) an agency or instrumentality of a government of a covered nation, (iii) a citizen or national of a covered nation without U.S. status as a citizen, national or lawful permanent resident, (iv) an entity organized under the laws of, or having its principal place of business in, a covered nation, or (v) an entity controlled by any of the above, including subsidiaries, measured by more than 50% ownership of stock in a corporation, profits interests or capital interests in a partnership, or other beneficial interest in the entity (under the section 318 attribution rules).

There would be an exception for publicly traded entities, except that (i) any exchange or market which is incorporated or organized under the laws of a covered nation or has its principal place of business in a covered nation is excluded from the definition of exchange or market for this purpose, and (ii) such entity shall still be deemed to be a foreign-controlled entity if 1 or more specified foreign entities or foreign-controlled entities controls more than 50%.

An entity is a ""foreign-influenced entity"" if:

(i) During the taxable year:

A specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint a board member, executive officer, or similar individual;

A single specified foreign entity owns at least 25% of the entity;

One or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate at least 40% of the entity; or

At least 15% of the entity's debt is held in the aggregate by one or more specified foreign entities; or

(ii) During the prior taxable year, the entity made an ""applicable payment"" to a specified foreign entity pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement which entitles the specified foreign entity (or a related entity) to exercise ""effective control"" over (i) any qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer (or any related person) or (ii) the extraction, processing, or recycling of any applicable critical mineral or production of an eligible component by the taxpayer (or any related person):

""Effective control"" generally would mean 1 or more agreements or arrangements which provide 1 or more contractual counterparties (or related person) of a taxpayer with specific authority over key aspects of the production of eligible components, energy generation, or energy storage which are not included in the measures of control through authority, ownership, or debt held.

Until FEOC guidance is issued, ""effective control"" would mean the unrestricted contractual right of a contractual counterparty to make certain major decisions for the taxpayer (including any related party to the taxpayer), such as (i) determine the quantity or timing of production of an eligible components, (ii) determine the amount or timing of activities related to the production of electricity or the storage or electrical energy, (iii) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a production unit, (iv) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a qualified facility, (v) restrict access to data critical to production or storage of energy, or to the site of production or any part of a qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer, to the personnel or agents of such contractual counterparty, or (vi) on an exclusive basis, maintain, repair, or operate any plant or equipment which is necessary to the production of eligible components or electricity.

With respect to a licensing agreement entered into with a contractual counterparty (or related person), ""effective control"" would also mean a contractual right to (i) specify or otherwise direct 1 or more sources of components, subcomponents, or applicable critical minerals, (ii) direct the operation, (iii) limit the taxpayer's utilization of intellectual property, (iv) receive royalties under the licensing agreement or any similar arrangement (or payments under any related agreement) beyond the 10th year of the agreement (including modifications or extensions), (v) direct or otherwise require the taxpayer (or any related party) to enter into an agreement for the provision of services for a duration longer than 2 years (including any modifications or extensions), or the contract, agreement, or other arrangement (vi) does not provide the licensee with all the technical data, information, and know-how necessary to enable the licensee to produce the eligible component or components subject to the contract, agreement, or other arrangement without further involvement from the contractual counterparty (or related person) or a specified foreign entity, or (vii) was entered into (or modified) on or after the date of enactment.

There would be an exception for a bona fide purchase or sale of intellectual property. However, a bona fide purchase or sale would not include any purchase or sale of intellectual property where the agreement provides that ownership of the intellectual property reverts to the contractual counterparty after a period of time.

There would be an exception for publicly traded entities, except such entity shall still be deemed to be a foreign-influenced entity if (i) a specified foreign entity has the authority to appoint a covered officer, (ii) a single specified foreign entity owns not less than 25% of the publicly traded entity, (iii) 1 or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate not less than 40% of the publicly traded entity, or (iv) debt in excess of 15% of the publicly traded debt of the publicly traded entity has been issued to 1 or more specified foreign entities.

Whether construction or production of any property includes ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"" would be determined based on whether the ""material assistance cost ratio"" is less than the ""threshold percentage"".

Threshold percentages:

For any qualified facility under sections 45Y or 48E, the threshold percentage would be:

40% if construction begins in 2026;

45% if construction begins in 2027;

50% if construction begins in 2028;

55% if construction begins in 2029; and

60% if construction begins after Dec. 31, 2029.

For energy storage technology under section 48E, the threshold percentage would be:

55% if construction begins in 2026;

60% if construction begins in 2027;

65% if construction begins in 2028;

70% if construction begins in 2029; and

75% if construction begins in after Dec. 31, 2029.

For solar energy components:

50% if sold during 2026;

60% if sold during 2027;

70% if sold during 2028;

80% if sold during 2029; and

85% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For wind energy components:

85% if sold during 2026; and

90% if sold during 2027.

For inverters:

50% if sold during 2026;

55% if sold during 2027;

60% if sold during 2028;

65% if sold during 2029; and

70% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For qualifying battery components:

60% if sold during 2026;

65% if sold during 2027;

70% if sold during 2028;

80% if sold during 2029; and

85% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For applicable critical minerals:

0% if sold after Dec. 31, 2025 and before Jan. 1, 2030;

25% if sold during 2030;

30% if sold during 2031;

40% if sold during 2032; and

50% if sold after Dec. 31, 2032.

Observation: For purposes of the FEOC requirements, the bill would codify that ""beginning of construction"" for tax purposes is determined pursuant to rules under IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either Notice), as in effect on Jan. 1, 2025.

Observation: Treasury would be required to issue guidance not later than Dec. 31, 2027 applying new threshold percentages for critical minerals equaling or exceeding these amounts, taking into account domestic geographic availability, supply chain constraints, domestic processing capacity needs, and national security concerns.

Material assistance cost ratios:

For any qualified facility or energy storage technology, the material assistance cost ratio is the ratio of (i) the total costs of all manufactured products incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology upon completion of construction minus such costs that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, divided by (ii) the total costs of all manufactured products incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology upon completion of construction.

""Manufactured product"" has the same meaning as provided in domestic content guidance.

For any product line that produces eligible components, the material assistance cost ratio is the ratio of (i) the total direct materials costs that are paid or incurred for production of such eligible components minus such costs that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, divided by (ii) the total direct materials costs that are paid or incurred for production of such eligible components.

Safe harbor tables: Not later than Dec. 31, 2026, Treasury would be required to issue safe harbor tables. Until then, and for qualified facilities that begin construction within 60 days after the issuance of such tables, a taxpayer may (i) use the tables provided in the domestic content safe harbor guidance (IRS Notice 2025-08) to establish the total direct material cost of any listed eligible component or manufactured product and (ii) rely on a certification by the supplier that the manufactured product, eligible component, constituent element, material, or subcomponent was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

Certification requirement: The certification from the supplier would be required to (i) include the supplier's EIN, (ii) be signed under penalty of perjury, (iii) be retained by the supplier for not less than 6 years and be provided to the IRS upon request, and (iv) state either (1) that such property was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity and that the supplier does not know (or have reason to know) that any prior supplier in the chain of production of that property is a prohibited foreign entity, or (2) the total direct material cost for each product or component that were not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

If a taxpayer knows or has reason to know that a manufactured product or eligible component was produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, then the taxpayer must treat all direct material costs with respect to such product or component as mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity and may not rely on a certification from the supplier.

Binding written contract exception: Upon the election of the taxpayer (in form and manner to be designated by Treasury), any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent element, material, or subcomponent acquired by the taxpayer pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, and placed in service before Jan. 1, 2030 (January 1, 2028 in the case of solar and wind property used to generate electricity) in a facility that began construction before August 1, 2025, would not be included for purposes of determining the material assistance cost ratio.

Observation: The imposition of FEOC rules to tax credit qualification would introduce an additional layer of complexity. The statute would further authorize the Treasury Department to issue regulations under these rules, including establishing rules to prevent evasion, circumvention, or abuse of the rules through (i) impermissible technology licensing arrangements with specified foreign entities, (ii) abuse of the binding written contract exception through stockpiling of any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent material, or subcomponent during any period prior to application of the rules, or where the facts and circumstances demonstrate that the beginning of construction of a qualified facility or energy storage technology has not in fact occurred.

Extended assessment period: Any deficiency attributable to an error in the determination of material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity could be assessed within 6 years after the return for such year was filed.

Accuracy-related penalty: If there is a ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"", then the substantial understatement of income tax penalty would apply to understatements of income tax by more than 1% of the tax required to be shown on the return.

A ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" would be disallowance of a credit under sections 45X, 45Y, or 48E by reason of overstating the material assistance cost ratio.

For an entity claiming direct pay under section 6417, a ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" would cause an ""excessive payment"" and incur the 20% penalty on the amount of the excessive payment (unless the taxpayer shows reasonable cause).

Penalty for false certification of supplier: If an inaccurate or false certification by a supplier results in the ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" and the understatement of income tax exceeds the lesser of (i) 5% of the tax required to be shown on the return or (ii) $100,000, then the person making the certification would be required to pay a penalty equal to the greater of (a) 10% of the amount of the underpayment attributable to the inaccuracy or falsity or (b) $5,000 (unless the person shows reasonable cause).

Washington, DC, July 3, 2025 – The National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) welcomed today’s final vote in the House of Representatives of a bill with multiple NBAA-supported initiatives to promote the growth, safety and sustainability of the U.S. aviation industry.

The wide-ranging budget reconciliation measure was initially passed in the House on May 22. The Senate passed its revised version on July 1, sending the bill back to the House for today’s vote. The bill now heads to the president’s desk, and he is expected to sign the legislation into law.

The final legislation preserves $12.52 billion to fund replacement of aging air traffic control (ATC) facilities, systems and infrastructure and to bolster controller staffing and training.

Announced by House leaders in April, the ATC funding provision has the support of NBAA and more than 50 other aviation stakeholders comprising the Modern Skies Coalition of aviation associations, trade unions, manufacturers and others.

“We thank congressional leaders for preserving this vital ATC-transformation measure in the final budget-reconciliation bill, which provides a critical downpayment on investments in new technologies, facilities, the controller workforce and other priorities,” said NBAA President and CEO Ed Bolen.

The legislation also includes a permanent reinstatement of full and immediate expensing on purchases of factory-new and preowned aircraft. The current expensing schedule, most recently authorized in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, is phasing out and set to expire in 2027.

Immediate expensing has proven effective for incentivizing aircraft purchase, which in turn helps companies obtain a competitive asset and supports American manufacturing jobs. In the U.S., business aviation supports 1.3 million high-skill, high-paying manufacturing and service jobs and accounts for $340 billion in annual economic activity.

The final legislation also maintains a key provision supporting business aviation’s goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 – an additional two-year extension of the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit incentivizing production of sustainable aviation fuel to 2031, albeit with a reduction in the credit’s value, which could pose challenges for incentivizing enough production to meet demand.

“This bill enacts many important initiatives to ensure America’s continued leadership in aviation,” Bolen said. “The business aviation community looks forward to working with Congress and government agency leaders to ensure its full implementation.”

The online platform allows EU buyers to offer demand for biomethane, natural gas, hydrogen and raw materials.
The Hydrogen Mechanism is “designed to support the market development of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen and its derivatives (ammonia, methanol, electro-sustainable aviation fuel)”, the Directorate said in an online statement.
A Commission information page about the platform says, “The EU Energy and Raw Materials Platform enables the collection and exchange of market data, information about demand and supply, demand aggregation, and joint purchasing of energy-related products and raw materials.
The two other mechanisms under the platform - the Gas Mechanism and the Raw Materials Mechanism - will launch “in the coming months”, the Directorate’s statement said.","The European Commission rolled out Wednesday a mechanism for coordinated purchases of hydrogen, the first mechanism under the EU Energy and Raw Materials Platform.

The online platform allows EU buyers to offer demand for biomethane, natural gas, hydrogen and raw materials. It seeks to give EU companies a cost-effective and efficient access to such commodities by enabling negotiations with competing suppliers. The Commission’s Directorate-General for Energy said more products may be covered in the future.

The Hydrogen Mechanism is “designed to support the market development of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen and its derivatives (ammonia, methanol, electro-sustainable aviation fuel)”, the Directorate said in an online statement.

“The first round of matching demand and supply is planned for September 2025”, it added.

The Hydrogen Mechanism will operate until 2029 under the European Hydrogen Bank, as specified under the European Union’s “Regulation on the Internal Markets for Renewable Gas, Natural Gas and Hydrogen”. The Hydrogen Bank is an EU Innovation Fund financing platform to scale up the renewable hydrogen value chain in the 27-nation bloc and partner countries.

Energy and Housing Commissioner Dan Jorgensen said, “With the Hydrogen Mechanism launched today, we empower the European industry to seize competitive opportunities while advancing towards greater security of supply and decarbonization”.

A Commission information page about the platform says, “The EU Energy and Raw Materials Platform enables the collection and exchange of market data, information about demand and supply, demand aggregation, and joint purchasing of energy-related products and raw materials. The Platform fosters collaboration, efficiency, and transparency in finding counterparts”.

“It does not directly provide financing or support negotiations which may take place, outside of the Platform, between Participants following their connections through the Platform”, the page says.

However, financial institutions may participate in the platform to publish information about their financing offers, the page says.

The two other mechanisms under the platform - the Gas Mechanism and the Raw Materials Mechanism - will launch “in the coming months”, the Directorate’s statement said.

The Gas Mechanism is expected to replace AggregateEU, a mechanism in which gas suppliers compete to book demand placed by companies in the EU and its Energy Community partner countries. AggregateEU has been extended, having initially been meant only for the 2023-24 winter.

In March 2025 the Directorate said a second midterm round for AggregateEU matched nearly 20 billion cubic meters (706.29 billion cubic feet). Midterm rounds offer six-month contracts for potential suppliers during a buyer-seller partnership of up to five years.

The Directorate said February 1, 2024, announcing the first midterm tender, “In early 2024, with the effects of the energy crisis still not over, AggregateEU is introducing a different concept of mid-term tenders in order to address the growing demand for stability and predictability from buyers and sellers of natural gas”.

“Under such tenders, buyers will be able to submit their demand for seasonal 6-month periods (for a minimum 1,800,000 MWh for LNG and 30,000 for NBP per period), going from April 2024 to October 2029"", the Directorate said then. ""This is intended to support sellers in identifying buyers who might be interested in a longer trading partnership - i.e. up to 5 years”.

NBP gas, or National Balancing Point gas, refers to gas from the national transmission systems of EU states.

A total of seven rounds have been conducted under AggregateEU, pooling over 119 Bcm of demand and attracting 191 Bcm of offers. Nearly 100 Bcm have been matched, according to the latest results announcement March 26, 2025.

“In line with the Hydrogen and Decarbonized gases package, the Commission is now working on establishing a permanent instrument for the joint purchasing of gas and of other similar mechanisms for the demand aggregation of important commodities such as hydrogen and critical raw materials”, the announcement said.

(Asharq Al-Awasat) Türkiye will set mandates for airlines and jet fuel suppliers to boost uptake of sustainable aviation fuel, with a goal of reducing aviation emissions by 5% by 2030, its civil aviation authority said on its website.

The move is aimed at complying with the UN International Civil Aviation Organization's emission reduction scheme that will become mandatory in 2027.

The new rules will oblige airlines to use sufficient SAF in international flights involving Türkiye to meet the 5% emissions reduction goal. They will also require jet fuel suppliers in the country to procure SAF to meet that target, and domestic oil refiners Tupras and Socar to start producing SAFs, Reuters reported.

The authority will publish minimum emission reduction targets before the end of the third quarter each year, it said, adding it would penalize airlines and jet fuel suppliers for any non-compliance.

Airline operators must load 90% of the SAF they need for international flights in Türkiye, the authority said.

Aviation is responsible for 2.5% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, according to the International Energy Agency.

Tupras, Türkiye's largest oil refiner, aims to produce 20,000 metric tons of SAF at one of its major plants in 2026, the company said earlier this year.

It aims to lift production up to 400,000 tons by building a new unit at its Izmir refinery, pending a final investment decision.

U.S. routes faced declining VFR (visiting friends and family) demand due to geopolitical tensions and stiff competition from carriers like American Airlines and Viva Aerobus.
Domestically, Viva Aerobus—now Mexico's largest airline by capacity—has muscled into Volaris' core markets, holding a 61% share in Monterrey.","The Mexican aviation market has long been a battleground for carriers seeking to dominate domestic and regional routes. Among them, Volaris Group (VLRS) stands out as the largest ultra-low-cost carrier (ULCC) in Mexico, commanding a 42% domestic market share. Recent operational adjustments and strategic partnerships highlight the airline's pivot toward growth in high-demand corridors while retreating from less profitable markets. For investors, the question remains: Does this agility position Volaris for sustained success, or does its financial fragility overshadow its potential?

Operational Performance: Growth Amid Challenges

Volaris' first-quarter 2025 results revealed mixed signals. While passenger numbers rose 7.1% to 7.4 million, its net loss widened to $51 million, driven by a 12% year-over-year decline in operating revenues. The depreciation of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and falling revenue per passenger exacerbated these pressures. Load factors also dipped, with domestic routes hitting 86.5%—a 3.8 percentage point drop—while international routes struggled more, dropping 5.2 points to 74.7%.

Despite these headwinds, Volaris is doubling down on operational discipline. CEO Enrique Beltranena emphasized a shift toward prioritizing unit revenue over load factors, a strategy aimed at stabilizing margins amid macroeconomic uncertainty. The airline's fleet modernization—now 61% NEO models—has reduced CASM (cost per available seat mile) by 3%, underscoring the cost-saving benefits of newer aircraft.

Strategic Route Adjustments: Exit U.S., Double Down on Domestic

Volaris' most striking move in mid-2025 was its withdrawal from all U.S. routes from Monterrey, Mexico's third-largest city. This decision, while painful, reflects a pragmatic focus on profitability. U.S. routes faced declining VFR (visiting friends and family) demand due to geopolitical tensions and stiff competition from carriers like American Airlines and Viva Aerobus.

Instead, Volaris is reinvesting in high-growth domestic markets. New routes from Monterrey now connect to central Mexican hubs like Guadalajara and Mexico City, with frequencies increasing by 33%. The airline also launched 30 new routes in total, including international services to Tulum, Costa Rica, and Los Angeles from Querétaro—a city it previously abandoned in 2018.

Strategic Partnerships: Expanding Reach, Mitigating Risk

Volaris' June 2025 partnerships signal a push into international markets. A codeshare with China's Hainan Airlines opens access to Asia, while a fleet deal with CDB Aviation secures three new A320neo aircraft. These moves are strategically timed: Mexico's tourism boom and rising Chinese business travel demand could drive incremental revenue.

The airline's collaboration with Airbus on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) further positions it as a sustainability leader—a critical edge in an industry facing tightening emissions regulations.

Valuation: Is the Stock a Bargain or a Risk?

Volaris' stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of 12.5x, below its five-year average of 15.8x, suggesting investors are pricing in near-term risks like currency volatility and weak margins. Key valuation metrics include:

EBITDAR Margin: Declined to 29.9% in Q1 2025 from 30.6% in 2024, reflecting cost pressures.

Debt Levels: Net debt/EBITDAR rose to 2.7x, a potential red flag if cash reserves ($862 million) prove insufficient for further fleet investments.

Market Dynamics: A Duel for Dominance

Volaris faces a two-front battle. Domestically, Viva Aerobus—now Mexico's largest airline by capacity—has muscled into Volaris' core markets, holding a 61% share in Monterrey. Internationally, Aeroméxico's alliances with U.S. carriers threaten Volaris' attempts to expand. However, Volaris' cost structure (CASM ex fuel up only 5%) remains leaner, giving it pricing power in budget-conscious markets.

Investment Thesis: A Wait-and-See Approach

Volaris' stock presents a compelling risk-reward trade-off. On one hand, its route realignment and fleet upgrades position it to capitalize on Mexico's booming tourism sector (tourist arrivals rose 18% in Q1 2025). The Hainan partnership could unlock cross-Pacific demand, while its focus on central Mexico—where economic growth outpaces national averages—aligns with high-potential markets.

Yet risks loom large. The peso's weakness continues to bite revenue, and load factors must stabilize to improve margins. Investors should monitor Q2 results for signs of recovery in unit revenue and EBITDAR.

Final Take

Volaris is betting its future on agility—shifting routes to high-margin corridors, modernizing its fleet, and leveraging international alliances. For investors, the stock offers exposure to Mexico's economic upswing but demands patience. A long-term hold is advisable for those willing to overlook near-term volatility, but a wait-and-see stance is prudent until Q3 results clarify margin recovery.",,N,,2025-07-03 14:11:08.423358

Million Air Albany (KALB), an Avfuel-branded fixed-base operator (FBO), and the Albany County Airport Authority are proud to announce the availability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), providing a meaningful solution for operators seeking to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from flight operations.

This marks the first location in New York to offer a consistent supply of SAF specifically for business and general aviation.

In collaboration with Avfuel and the airport authority, Million Air received its first truckload of SAF at Albany International Airport on June 18, marking a major milestone in the FBO’s commitment to environmental responsibility.

“Sustainable aviation fuel is the most effective tool we have today to reduce the aviation industry’s carbon footprint,” said Brian King, general manager of Million Air Albany. “This initiative has been four years in the making. It’s been a privilege to work alongside Avfuel and the airport authority to bring this initiative to life, it’s a partnership we’re incredibly proud of.”

“Albany International Airport is proud to be the first airport in New York State to offer sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) through Avfuel to our general aviation customers,” said Sam Fresina, chair of the Albany County Airport Authority.

“This milestone reflects our deep commitment to supporting cleaner, greener technologies that protect our environment and advance the future of air travel. It also represents an exciting business opportunity for ALB, strengthening our position as an innovative transportation hub and a responsible community partner.”

The SAF, delivered by Avfuel from its supply point in the Northeast, has a targeted blend percentage of 30% neat SAF to 70% traditional jet fuel, providing a 24% reduction in carbon emissions over the fuel’s lifecycle compared to petroleum-based jet fuel. In its neat (pre-blended) form, SAF has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

“We couldn’t be prouder to partner with Million Air Albany and the Albany County Airport Authority to help further sustainability initiatives at a key Northeast location,” said Joel Hirst, Avfuel’s senior vice president of sales.

“Just six months ago, Albany’s authority and FBO leadership teams chose to entrust their fueling and operational support needs to Avfuel’s care as a new fuel supply partner, this sustainable product-line expansion reflects the power of our partnership, and our shared dedication to new aviation fuel technologies.”

This initiative is part of Million Air’s Beyond Green sustainability program, a company-wide commitment to responsible aviation practices. The Beyond Green platform focuses on integrating more sustainable solutions across Million Air’s network, from renewable energy investments and facility efficiencies to greener fuel options, like SAF. SAF is made from renewable and sustainably sourced waste materials, like used cooking oil.

Once blended with conventional jet fuel, SAF is a drop-in solution that meets ASTM D1655 specifications and performs to the same standards as traditional jet fuel, requiring no changes to aircraft, fuel infrastructure or handling procedures.

The company had originally planned a sustainable aviation fuel plant in Lake Preston, South Dakota, but when that site failed to secure permits, Gevo turned its attention to Richardton.
If completed ahead of Gevo’s South Dakota plant, the Richardton facility could become the first fully integrated sustainable aviation fuel plant in the United States.
“By blending biofuel with petroleum jet fuel, not only do you stretch fuel supply, but you also reduce overall emissions.” The blended fuel typically contains 10–50% sustainable aviation fuel, depending on current regulations.","Richardton, N.D: North Dakota Congresswoman Julie Fedorchak visited the Red Trail Energy bioethanol and carbon sequestration facility in Richardton on Monday, marking a significant moment for the future of sustainable energy in the state, reports AGWeek.

Fedorchak’s visit came months after Gevo Inc., a Colorado-based sustainable fuel company, purchased the plant for approximately $210 million. The company announced it plans to add a new on-site facility to convert ethanol into sustainable aviation fuel.

The acquisition was first revealed in September 2024. Red Trail Energy shareholders approved the sale in December, and the deal was finalized in February 2025.

Fedorchak, who co-chairs the Congressional Biofuels Caucus, met with Gevo representatives to discuss biofuel production, project timelines, carbon capture, and how energy and agriculture can work together. In a conversation with The Dickinson Press, she voiced strong support for the initiative.

“North Dakota’s economy is rooted in agriculture,” Fedorchak said. “We need to find better and higher value uses for our crops. Biofuels represent a major opportunity, especially now when the world is demanding more energy with lower carbon emissions.”

Gevo, founded in 2005, focuses on developing sustainable, low-carbon alternatives to traditional petroleum-based fuels. The company had originally planned a sustainable aviation fuel plant in Lake Preston, South Dakota, but when that site failed to secure permits, Gevo turned its attention to Richardton.

Chris Ryan, Gevo’s president and COO, said the Richardton location was ideal due to its existing infrastructure, access to local agriculture, and an operational carbon capture system.

“We wanted a site that aligns with our strategy and could move quickly. Richardton checked every box,” Ryan said.

If completed ahead of Gevo’s South Dakota plant, the Richardton facility could become the first fully integrated sustainable aviation fuel plant in the United States. Currently, the plant produces 65 million gallons of ethanol annually using 23 million bushels of corn. It also sells by-products like distillers grains, animal feed syrup, and corn oil.

The site already hosts the country’s first carbon storage project permitted under state regulations.

“The team running the plant is very efficient,” Ryan said. “We don’t plan on changing that.”

Gevo’s planned facility would convert the plant’s ethanol output directly into jet fuel on-site.

“That’s our main focus—producing sustainable aviation fuel from the ethanol already being made there,” Ryan added.

The project is expected to create around 50 permanent jobs, along with many more during the construction phase.

Stark County Commission Chairman Neal Messer, a Richardton native and grain farmer, welcomed the project, saying it would bring added value to local crops and support rural communities.

“This is a win for farmers. It lets smaller towns like Richardton grow and prosper,” Messer said.

He also confirmed receiving payments for carbon storage beneath his land and said he’s optimistic about the project’s agricultural impact, believing it would allow farmers to expand and diversify.

The aviation industry is under growing pressure to cut emissions. In 2021, the International Air Transport Association pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, with sustainable aviation fuel expected to account for 65% of that reduction and carbon capture for another 19%.

“Airlines are looking for lower-carbon fuel options,” Ryan said. “By blending biofuel with petroleum jet fuel, not only do you stretch fuel supply, but you also reduce overall emissions.”

The blended fuel typically contains 10–50% sustainable aviation fuel, depending on current regulations. Ryan believes that 100% sustainable aviation fuel could become more common in the future.

However, not everyone agrees on the benefits. The World Resources Institute (WRI) has raised concerns that sustainable aviation fuel may not significantly reduce emissions, pointing to the need for more farmland and the loss of carbon-absorbing grasslands—issues particularly relevant in North Dakota’s landscape.

Ryan responded that no major land-use changes are expected, since the ethanol plant has been operating for years. He also acknowledged the potential for increased corn production but said local farmers are ready.

“We asked our suppliers if they could grow more corn, and they said yes,” Ryan said.

Critics have also pointed out that the ethanol-to-jet fuel conversion ratio—1.7 gallons of ethanol to 1 gallon of jet fuel—is inefficient. Ryan countered that the process actually concentrates energy by removing water, improving energy content.

On carbon sequestration, environmental groups have raised safety concerns, including potential leaks into groundwater. Gevo officials said they are taking steps to reduce those risks.

Food vs Fuel Pros and Cons Below is a concise look at commonly cited food vs fuel pros and cons: Dimension Pros (Fuel Perspective) Cons (Food Perspective) Charting a Smarter Biofuel Future Global food challenges continue to influence the production of biofuels.","Biofuels have raced from the margins to the mainstream. The International Energy Agency projects that global demand for transport biofuels will climb 23 percent to roughly 200 billion liters by 2028—a scale big enough to shave millions of tons off net greenhouse-gas emissions.

At the same time, the advanced biofuel market is also experiencing intensive growth. Forecasts call for continued rapid expansion over the next several years.

But every liter of renewable fuel or ethanol needs a feedstock to power it. When that feedstock is corn, sugarcane, soy, or rapeseed that could have been somebody's dinner, we collide with several questions:

How do we decide whether this crop is food or fuel?

How do we decide food vs fuel for a cropland?

Should we use food crops or croplands for fuel when global hunger remains a fundamental problem?

This post unpacks what is the food vs fuel debate, why it matters to climate and human well-being, and where the science is pointing for a balanced path forward.

What Is Food vs Fuel?

At its core, the debate asks whether scarce agricultural land, water, and other inputs should be used to grow calories for people or hydrocarbons for engines.

The issue exploded during the 2007-2008 food-price spike, when rising biofuel mandates and commodity speculation pushed grain prices to record highs. The backlash sparked riots in more than thirty countries.

Scholars now frame the dilemma as a food energy ecosystem. The aim is to drive a holistic stewardship of land, carbon, and livelihoods.

With this in mind, what does it mean when food is a fuel? It means the same kernel of corn can power an SUV or nourish a child.

Converting corn to sustainable fuel delivers renewable energy and rural income. At the same time, it diverts cropland and may trigger indirect land-use change (ILUC)—for example, pasture converted to soy in one region pushes ranchers to clear forests elsewhere.

The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) notes that US corn used for ethanol ballooned from 54 million tons in 2006-2007 to 127 million tons by 2011-2012. This shift marks over 40 percent of total harvest to ethanol at its peak.

Unsurprisingly, these reallocations rippled through food markets worldwide.

What Foods Are Fuel?

When people ask what foods are fuel, the answer spans first-generation and emerging candidates:

Crop or Source

Fuel Route

Notes

These examples highlight why food is more than just fuel. It is culture, nutrition, and security. These values all argue for directing edible biomass to plates first.

Food vs Fuel Pros and Cons

Below is a concise look at commonly cited food vs fuel pros and cons:

Pros (Fuel Perspective)

Cons (Food Perspective)

Charting a Smarter Biofuel Future

Global food challenges continue to influence the production of biofuels. Despite their historic rise over the last decade and a half, their adoption should never interfere with anyone's access to food.

But from that same human-centric position, the rise of biofuels comes due to the imminent existential threat of climate change. The faster we adopt biofuels and deploy them to replace fossil fuels, the better.

Between these two points in food-vs-fuel lies a tension. Do we risk food shortages and world hunger to power the world on renewables? Or do we risk climate disaster by slowing down feedstock crops to produce food?

Fortunately, technology is rewriting the playbook and finding ingenious solutions to this issue.

Second- and third-generation processes turn waste oils, landfill gas, agricultural residues, and even algae into drop-in fuels at a commercial scale. Global demand growth is now projected to be led by renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made primarily from non-food feedstocks.

Continuous R&D, carbon-smart farming, and yield-boosting ag-genomics mean we don't have to choose between energy and food. Both issues can be better addressed simultaneously.

So, what is food vs fuel in 2025? It is no longer a zero-sum fight but a design challenge. Innovate so that kilns, cook-tops, and car engines run on carbon-light molecules while fields keep feeding a population on track for 9.7 billion by 2050.

The food vs fuel debate will stay with us for now. But its future chapters will be written through cooperative integration of technology and innovation that both nourish people and power progress.

Despite the blend being initially just 1% SAF combined with 99% jet fuel, “the official use of SAF on commercial flights marks a significant milestone in the airline’s transition toward a more environmentally friendly future,” said Captain Puttipong Prasarttong-Osoth, President of Bangkok Airways.

According to the airline this blend will help reduce emissions by an average of approximately 128 kg of CO2 per flight. It is also in keeping with Thailand’s proposed introduction of a SAF mandate at a 1% blend from 2026. This is expected to increase to 3 per cent in 2030 and 8 % by 2037.

By comparison, the UK’s SAF mandate, which was introduced on 1 January 2025, starts at 2 % of total UK jet fuel demand, increasing linearly to 10% in 2030 and then to 22% in 2040. It could deliver up to 6.3 megatonnes of carbon savings per year by 2040.

Bangkok Airways’ low carbon journey

The regional carrier first refuelled with SAF on a pilot flight operating between Samui and Bangkok in 2024. The fuel was supplied by PTT Oil and Retail Business Public Company (OR) and in May of this year, the airline signed a Letter of Intent with OR as part of its Low Carbon Skies initiative to use SAF produced domestically in Thailand.

In addition to refuelling with SAF, the airline has implemented other measures to reduce emissions, including more efficient aviation fuel use. The airline also prides itself on actively contributing to the sustainable growth of Thailand’s aviation industry.

It is “committed to evolving into a truly sustainable airline,” guided by its Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) framework. Other areas it is investing in to decarbonise is more efficient waste management and use of resources as well as the broader adoption of alternative energy sources.

How aviation stakeholders in Thailand are scaling SAF supply and demand

In March, 2025 the Thai government through the Ministry of Industry (MoI) announced it is partnering with six local companies and their affiliates to establish a waste cooking oil-based SAF feedstock supply chain. The initiative also aims to raise public awareness and participation through campaigns, education and network-building.

In May, one of the six companies the Thai government is partnering with – Bangchak Group – announced the launch of its first SAF production plant at the Bangchak Phra Khanong Refinery in Bangkok. The facility will produce 100% neat SAF with an initial production capacity of 1m litres per day. Confirmed customers include Shell Eastern Trading in Singapore and Japan’s Cosmo Oil.

In 2023 Thailand’s flag carrying airline, Thai Airways operated its first flights using SAF produced by Neste and supplied by PTT. The refuelling was carried out at Phuket Airport ahead of the airline flying to Bangkok.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Bangkok-Airways-SAF-refuelling-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-03 13:13:56.379132

Initially propelled by decarbonization mandates, SAF is now positioned as a core element in global energy security strategies.

This shift is driven by increased volatility in conventional jet fuel markets, tightening feedstock availability, fragmented regulation, and growing supply chain risk across major geographies.

Strategic Outlook

By mid-2025, SAF has moved beyond its role as an environmental compliance tool and is now integral to risk mitigation and energy diversification in aviation.

The market is structurally imbalanced: Europe is short, North America is long, and Asia is gaining capacity but remains fragmented. Market penetration remains below 1% of global aviation fuel consumption, but long-term fundamentals point to rapid growth as regulatory momentum builds, corporate net-zero targets accelerate, and geopolitical risks continue to pressure fossil jet fuel logistics.

Key growth drivers for the next 6–18 months include

New blending mandates in Asia and Latin America.

Expansion of book-and-claim platforms for indirect SAF compliance.

Trade route disruptions boosting SAF interest as an alternative supply option.

Investment in non-lipid feedstocks and advanced conversion technologies.

Macro market Dynamics and Strategic Positioning

Recent geopolitical shocks in the Middle East, particularly the June airstrikes in Iran, have intensified disruptions across traditional jet fuel supply routes. Volatility in global jet fuel markets is being amplified by bottlenecks in refining and transport infrastructure.

Global aviation players are accelerating the adoption of SAF not only to meet emissions targets, but to secure fuel supply against price shocks, sanctions, and logistics constraints. Jet fuel derivatives in Singapore saw a sharp rise of over 41% in traded volumes in June, while inventories at the Port of Fujairah increased for a fourth consecutive week to over 19.15 million barrels.

Middle distillate inventories, including jet fuel, reached their highest levels since March 31, reflecting regional stockpiling in anticipation of trade risks. SAF is now recognized not just as an emissions compliance mechanism, but as a strategic hedge for energy diversification. Airlines and refiners are recalibrating procurement strategies to accommodate SAF as a permanent fixture in fuel supply chains.

Global SAF Supply Landscape

Asia-Pacific

The Asia-Pacific region has emerged as the fastest-growing SAF production hub, with total capacity now approaching 2.0 million metric tons annually. Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and Malaysia are leading investments in HEFA-based and co-processing SAF facilities. However, structural constraints continue to limit growth.

Blending mandates are still largely absent, with only a few countries announcing voluntary or future SAF targets. Feedstock sourcing remains a critical weakness, particularly in used cooking oil (UCO), which dominates regional feedstock supply but suffers from poor traceability and informal supply chains.

Export restrictions on raw feedstocks from Indonesia and China are further complicating regional balance. Advanced feedstocks such as municipal waste and agricultural residues are being explored but remain commercially underdeveloped. Scaling such feedstocks would require investment in waste segregation, pre-treatment infrastructure, and refining technologies that are still immature in the region.

Europe

Europe remains the policy front-runner due to the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandating a 2% SAF blending requirement from 2025. Total SAF production in the region is estimated at 1.6–1.8 million tons, falling short of expected demand exceeding 2.5 million tons in 2025.

As a result, Europe is structurally dependent on imports, especially from North America and Asia. Local feedstock availability is limited due to EU waste regulations, indirect land use change (ILUC) constraints, and high demand for UCO.

Europe is investing in advanced feedstocks, but scale remains a long-term challenge. Supply tightness is expected to persist, sustaining premium price levels and import flows into the region.

North America

North America continues to lead in SAF production volume, with capacity estimated between 2.4 and 2.7 million metric tons in 2025. Growth is supported by strong policy incentives through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), including SAF-specific tax credits.

Despite supply strength, domestic SAF adoption remains low due to the absence of federal blending mandates. Most demand is concentrated in California and Washington, supported by state-level programs. Export flows are rising, but recent tightening of credit eligibility criteria has created uncertainty around long-term international trade.

Feedstock availability remains robust, particularly in soybean oil and tallow, but competition with renewable diesel producers is escalating input costs.

Middle East and Africa

The Middle East and Africa remain in early development stages for SAF. Limited production exists, but both regions have significant long-term potential. The Middle East is positioning itself for downstream investment via national oil companies, while several African nations possess strong feedstock fundamentals but lack industrial-scale refining infrastructure. Regional demand remains low, hindered by high production costs, absence of mandates, and minimal government engagement with SAF adoption frameworks.

Latin America

Latin America is resource-rich in SAF-relevant feedstocks, particularly UCO, soybean derivatives, and ethanol for alcohol-to-jet pathways. However, policy frameworks remain underdeveloped. Brazil has launched its ProBioQAV roadmap, but adoption is still in early phases and there are no enforceable SAF mandates across the region.

Production remains small, and uptake is constrained by macroeconomic volatility and regulatory inertia.

SAF Demand Overview

Europe

Europe is currently the world’s largest SAF-consuming region due to binding policy mandates. Demand is estimated at 2.3–2.6 million metric tons in 2025. Airlines are executing long-term offtake agreements, and book-and-claim platforms are being scaled up to meet both regulatory and voluntary corporate sustainability goals.

North America

Despite being the largest producer, the U.S. demand footprint is limited to 700–900 thousand metric tons in 2025. Adoption is concentrated in states with clean fuels programs.

Corporate demand from cargo and passenger airlines is gradually increasing, supported by sustainability-linked procurement.

Asia-Pacific

Regional SAF demand is still low, estimated between 450–600 thousand metric tons in 2025. However, market momentum is building, driven by strategic risk assessments and early-stage pilot programs. Infrastructure gaps, feedstock uncertainty, and cost premiums continue to limit broader adoption.

Middle East & Africa

Demand across the Middle East and Africa remains negligible. The region has initiated SAF demonstration flights, but commercial use is not yet scaling due to the absence of incentives and the high cost differential relative to fossil jet fuel.

Latin America

Latin American SAF demand is still in the pilot stage. Limited uptake from regional carriers is supported by voluntary programs but lacks policy enforcement and cost competitiveness.

SAF Price Trends and Market Structure

As of July 3, 2025, the Asia SAF-jet fuel spread was assessed at $1,109.99 per M/T, reflecting a modest rise from the previous day. SAF continues to trade at a premium between 3.5 to 4.5 times the price of fossil jet fuel, depending on region and feedstock source.

SAF certificate trading (book-and-claim) is gaining traction as a mechanism to bridge adoption gaps caused by infrastructure limitations.

Futures and derivatives linked to SAF remain thinly traded but are drawing increasing interest from hedging desks seeking to manage exposure to compliance-driven volatility.

GrainFuel Nexus® are closely monitoring:

Feedstock market tightness and competition from renewable diesel.

Variability in global policy alignment and blending mandates.

Certification and traceability standards for international credit eligibility.

Shipping and refinery capacity bottlenecks near major ports and hubs.

We expect expects SAF to evolve into a major traded commodity class by 2028, with structured financial instruments, cross-border certificate trading systems, and vertically integrated supply chains defining the competitive landscape.

Specifically, the SAF Matchmaker addresses three critical issues:

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. It will therefore facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes, while airlines are able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes. Subsequent trades will take place outside the platform.

Visibility: The platform carries comprehensive information regarding the available SAF, such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

Global digital shipbuilder Incat Crowther has been commissioned by Los Angeles operator Catalina Express to design a new low-emission, renewable diesel-powered passenger ferry. The new ferry will form part of the Port of Los Angeles’ $US31 million Los Angeles Marine Emission Reduction (LA MER) project, funded by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). Catalina Express was awarded a $15,000,000 grant to match its own $15,000,000 contribution to the project. LA MER aims to test and evaluate emission-reduction technologies as part of the Port of Los Angeles’ goal of becoming a zero-emission port.

The new 48-metre (160 foot) passenger ferry will service the popular one-hour tourist route between Los Angeles’ Long Beach Port and Santa Catalina Island. Capable of transporting up to 516 passengers across three spacious decks at speeds of up to 37 knots, the new vessel will be powered by renewable diesel fuel (R-99) comprised of plant-based stocks. The new vessel will be propelled by four EPA Tier 4-compliant MTU 4000 series engines, each designed to be equipped with a diesel particulate filter (DPF) once certified by the EPA, USCG, and CARB to meet CARB commercial harbor craft regulations.

The new vessel will replace three smaller Tier 2 and Tier 3 ferries with a combined six diesel engines, helping to reduce emissions while maintaining the same passenger capacity within the Catalina Express fleet.

In addition to offering a lower-emission transport option, the new vessel will also provide a world-class customer experience. Passenger comfort has been enhanced via a resiliently mounted superstructure which will reduce vibrations and noise transmitted from the hulls. The new vessel will offer spacious seating and amenities including two kiosks, a large protected luggage hold, space for 16 bicycles, café-style table seating, indoor and outdoor seating options and accessible toilets. The vessel has also been designed with active ride control comprising a pair of Naiad Active T-foil and interceptors to help reduce vessel motions.

The vessel’s main deck will seat 198 passengers, including space for four wheelchairs, in an air-conditioned cabin that boasts five bathrooms and a large kiosk. An internal staircase leads to the mid-deck which offers VIP seating for 142 passengers as well as another kiosk and two bathrooms. The mid-deck also provides aft outdoor seating for a further 39 passengers, two bathrooms and the vessel’s wheelhouse. External staircases from the mid-deck lead to a large, protected roof deck for 137 passengers.

Construction on the new vessel, which will take place at Marine Group Boat Works in San Diego, California, is planned to start in July 2025 with sea trials expected to occur in 2027.

“For over 43 years, Catalina Express has been environmentally conscious and has been able to meet or exceed federal and state regulations to help reduce emissions,” said Greg Bombard, President and CEO of Catalina Express.

“Catalina Express is grateful to CARB for this grant and the partnership with the Port of Los Angeles. Their support has allowed us to move forward on the construction of this new vessel to further the mission of environmental advancement and continuing to provide a valuable and affordable ferry service to Catalina Island for Island residents, visitors and local communities,” said Mr Bombard.

CARB Chair Liane Randolph said, “CARB is proud to support the development of the next generation of advanced marine vessels that will help protect the health of those living and working near ports. California is demonstrating what is possible and is leading the way in bringing cleaner marine vessel technology to the market.”

LA MER is part of California Climate Investments, a statewide initiative that puts billions of Cap-and-Trade dollars to work reducing greenhouse gas emissions, strengthening the economy, and improving public health and the environment – particularly in disadvantaged communities.

Incat Crowther North America Managing Director Grant Pecoraro said, “Incat Crowther is pleased to have been selected to design another groundbreaking and technologically advanced vessel for Catalina Express. We have an extensive track record of designing low and zero-emission ferries for operators around the world and what sets our approach apart is our technology-agnostic process to delivering bespoke designs. We’re looking forward to partnering with the team at Catalina Express to deliver an efficient, safe and world-class renewable diesel passenger vessel that will set the standard for other operators around the world looking to decarbonize.”

As a critical component of global transportation, the sector remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels. Due to stringent performance requirements, alternatives such as electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft are not (yet) viable for large-scale, long-haul aviation. As a result, Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) have emerged as a promising solution. SAF are similar to conventional fossil derived hydrocarbons, but are produced through more sustainable methods and feedstocks. They offer a key advantage: compatibility with existing aircraft and fuelling infrastructure.

One promising feedstock for SAF production is furfural, a biobased platform chemical that can be derived from hemicellulosic biomass, one of the most abundant sources of biomass on earth. While various furfural upgrading routes to SAF have been described in the literature, they tend to produce acyclic products with relatively low energy density. This limits their efficiency in jet engines, which benefit from fuels with high volumetric and gravimetric energy content.",https://www.utwente.nl/.utdesign/img/favicons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-07-03 13:14:16.456673

As Turkey moves closer to its 2030 emissions reduction goal, the commitment to SAF will play a vital role in shaping the future of the country’s aviation industry.","Turkey has unveiled a bold initiative to cut aviation and travel-related emissions by five percent by 2030, aiming to meet this target on time by introducing stringent new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) regulations. This move is part of the country’s broader climate strategy to align with global decarbonization goals, enhance air quality, and position itself as a regional leader in green aviation. By mandating the gradual adoption of SAF across domestic and international carriers operating in Turkish airspace, the government seeks to reduce the sector’s carbon footprint while driving innovation and investment in cleaner fuel alternatives.

Turkey’s civil aviation authority is taking significant steps to reduce aviation emissions by setting mandates for airlines and jet fuel suppliers to increase the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The goal is to cut emissions by 5% by the year 2030. This move aligns with the United Nations International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO) emission reduction program, which will become mandatory by 2027.

The new regulations focus on both airlines and jet fuel suppliers operating in Turkey. Airlines that fly international routes involving Turkey must use SAF to achieve the 5% emissions reduction target. In addition, fuel suppliers, including local refineries like Tupras, will also be required to source SAF to meet the overall target. This ambitious policy is part of Turkey’s broader efforts to reduce its aviation sector’s carbon footprint.

The civil aviation authority will publish minimum emission reduction targets on an annual basis before the third quarter of each year. These targets will guide airlines and fuel suppliers in meeting the required levels of SAF usage. For non-compliance, penalties will be imposed, ensuring that there are consequences for failing to meet the new standards.

One important aspect of the new regulations is that airlines must load 90% of their SAF requirements for international flights within Turkey. This ensures that the country takes a leading role in SAF usage, contributing to its own sustainability goals while complying with international aviation standards.

The drive for SAF stems from the aviation industry’s substantial role in contributing to global CO2 emissions. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), aviation accounts for approximately 2.5% of the world’s energy-related CO2 emissions. By shifting towards SAF, Turkey aims to reduce the environmental impact of its aviation industry while supporting the global transition towards cleaner energy sources.

The country’s largest oil refiner, Tupras, has already committed to producing 20,000 metric tons of SAF at its major plant by 2026. The company plans to scale up production even further, with a goal to increase output to 400,000 tons. This expansion will take place through the construction of a new SAF production unit at Tupras’ Izmir refinery, contingent on securing final investment approval.

Additionally, local biofuel company DB Tarimsal Enerji is set to play a significant role in this transition. The company has plans to establish a new facility with an annual production target of 100,000 tons of SAF. Together, these developments represent a substantial investment in sustainable aviation fuel production within Turkey, marking a significant step toward reducing the environmental footprint of the aviation industry.

On the consumption side, Turkey’s jet fuel usage saw a decrease of 4% in the previous year, amounting to 6.26 million tons, or approximately 135,000 barrels per day. This reduction in jet fuel consumption, while not necessarily driven by SAF initiatives, indicates that the country is actively looking for ways to optimize fuel efficiency and minimize its reliance on traditional jet fuels.

In addition to the focus on SAF production, this initiative is part of Turkey’s broader commitment to sustainability in its energy and transport sectors. The government is taking significant steps to enhance the country’s energy mix, supporting both domestic production and international standards for reducing carbon emissions. The country’s efforts to adopt SAF will not only help meet its international obligations but also create economic opportunities in the emerging biofuel sector.

The emphasis on SAF is particularly important for the aviation industry, which has long struggled with high emissions. As more countries and regions push for stricter environmental regulations, the demand for sustainable fuels like SAF is expected to rise. SAF is produced from renewable sources such as plant-based oils, waste materials, or even algae, offering a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuels.

Although SAF is more costly to produce compared to traditional jet fuel at present, its price is anticipated to drop as production volumes increase and technological advancements are made. The implementation of SAF mandates in Turkey is likely to drive the growth of the SAF industry, not only within the country but across the global aviation sector.

This policy represents a crucial step in Turkey’s ongoing efforts to align its aviation industry with global sustainability goals. By requiring airlines and fuel suppliers to meet specific SAF usage targets, Turkey is positioning itself as a leader in the global movement towards greener aviation. This proactive approach ensures that the country will remain competitive in the international aviation market, while also helping to mitigate the impact of climate change.

Turkey aims to reduce aviation and travel emissions by five percent by 2030 on time by implementing new SAF regulations, reinforcing its commitment to sustainable growth and global climate goals. This strategy supports cleaner air travel and aligns with international decarbonization efforts.

As Turkey moves closer to its 2030 emissions reduction goal, the commitment to SAF will play a vital role in shaping the future of the country’s aviation industry. By working closely with industry stakeholders and investing in local production, Turkey is laying the groundwork for a more sustainable and environmentally friendly aviation sector. With continued innovation and collaboration, the country is poised to meet the challenges of the future while contributing to the global transition towards renewable energy solutions.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-03-at-10.jpg,N,,2025-07-03 13:14:25.372642

While participating in the Pittsburgh 2030 District effort remains voluntary, local and state policies support its progress.","In an unparalleled achievement for urban sustainability efforts, a Pittsburgh district covering over 135 million square feet of commercial business space surpassed its carbon emissions reduction target six years ahead of schedule. The Pittsburgh 2030 District recently announced it achieved a 52 percent reduction in carbon emissions last year, exceeding its goal of a 50 to 65 percent reduction by 2030.

The built environment, including building operations, is responsible for a huge chunk of annual global carbon dioxide emissions, and it's still growing. The 2030 Districts Network, which the Pittsburgh district is a part of, is a collective of building industry leaders in cities in the United States and Canada committed to lessening that impact by reducing energy, water, and transportation-related building emissions. The Pittsburgh district is the largest member, representing about 14 percent of the network’s total square footage so far. Its achievement demonstrates what’s possible as every district in the collective works toward cutting carbon emissions by at least 50 percent by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2040.

Managed by the Western Pennsylvania-based nonprofit Green Building Alliance and made up of local building owners and operators, the Pittsburgh 2030 District spans over 1,300 buildings across healthcare, higher education, hospitality, technology and commercial real estate. Together, the properties reduced energy use by over 25 percent, saved $44.2 million in utility costs, and cut water use by over 33 percent — all while many businesses were returning to in-person operations after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Jenna Cramer, executive director of Green Building Alliance, credits the milestone to Pittsburgh’s legacy of reinvention. “With our strong industrial roots, revitalizing the city through sustainability, energy efficiency, and green building has been essential to our reemergence as a great place to live, work and grow,” Cramer told TriplePundit.

The Green Building Alliance recently released the Pittsburgh district’s annual progress report, which highlights energy efficiency and resiliency projects completed over the past two years.

“In 2012, we realized that most buildings we’ll have in 2030 already exist,” Cramer said. “That shifted our focus from new construction to upgrading older buildings for performance.”

District leaders attribute their success to a combination of building retrofits, clean energy adoption and policy alignment. Simple interventions like switching to LED lighting and upgrading to more efficient HVAC systems made a quick impact. “LEDs offer a fast return on investment and long-term savings,” Cramer said. “It was a no-brainer for many building owners.”

Wider electrification efforts also helped gain ground. One standout project was the complete overhaul of 411 Seventh Avenue, a century-old structure that’s now fully electric and among the district’s most efficient buildings, Cramer said.

Some buildings in the district are still in the process of transitioning away from natural gas to electricity and utilizing heat pumps and geothermal energy. For example, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, a historic landmark covering 15 acres in Pittsburgh, is integrating geothermal systems into new buildings, aiming for full electrification.

The regional electricity grid has also grown cleaner, aided by Pennsylvania’s renewable energy portfolio standard, Cramer said. Large local businesses — including PNC Bank, BNY Mellon and Carnegie Mellon University — are committed to sourcing 100 percent of their electricity from renewables.

Public-private partnerships are at the core of the Pittsburgh district’s success. The district includes participants from K-12 schools, higher education, government, nonprofits, and private industry, many of whom meet regularly to exchange best practices.

Members also participate in wider programs to collaborate with organizations outside of the Pittsburgh 2030 District, like the Western Pennsylvania Energy Consortium, which allows its members to collectively purchase clean energy, pooling their buying power to achieve goals faster, Cramer said. The Higher Education Climate Consortium is another example. Started by Green Building Alliance, the effort brings universities in the region together to reduce emissions.

“We’ve built a peer community that creates a sense of shared commitment,” Cramer said. “The Higher Education Climate Consortium, which we started in 2008, continues to align universities on climate goals to this day.”

Green Building Alliance also provides ongoing support for Pittsburg 2030 District members through building performance reviews, educational workshops, and monthly programming to keep stakeholders informed and engaged. For the alliance, sustainability isn’t just about carbon, it’s about people.

“We were the first 2030 District to formally include indoor air quality,” Cramer told 3p. “That became especially important during the pandemic. Practices like proper ventilation and filter changes don’t just improve health, they increase building value and tenant satisfaction.”

Equity is also a part of the district’s efforts. Green Building Alliance offers technical assistance and training for lower-income communities and small businesses. A recent initiative embedded climate resilience and health priorities into neighborhood development plans, helping ensure that sustainability efforts reflect community needs.

While participating in the Pittsburgh 2030 District effort remains voluntary, local and state policies support its progress. Pennsylvania’s Act 129 utility rebates and the statewide financing program for clean energy projects on commercial properties helped unlock funds for district projects. Meanwhile, the city of Pittsburgh’s ordinance that requires non-residential buildings over 50,000 square feet to report their energy and water use brought new partners into the fold.

Federal support, especially through the Inflation Reduction Act, has been crucial, too. Though federal funding cuts and pauses raise concerns about future funds.

“It’s a challenge. Some of those opportunities are in limbo, but even without mandates, we’ve made huge progress,” Cramer said. “Data-driven solutions and cross-sector partnerships have shown the business case is real. We’ve documented $540 million in utility savings and $5.4 billion in regional investment since we started.”

Looking ahead to 2040, when the district aims to reach net-zero emissions, Green Building Alliance remains focused on innovation, collaboration and transparency.

“Every city is different, but the lessons are clear,” Cramer said. “Partnerships work, data matters and reinvention is possible.”",https://back.3blcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/ratio_3_2/public/triplepundit/wide/Pittsburgh%202030%20District%20David%20L.%20Lawrence%20Convention%20Center.jpg?h=702ab45f,N,,2025-07-03 13:14:28.792312

Consequently, they observed 20 times higher methane emissions in shipping lanes compared to nearby areas that were undisturbed by traffic.

Despite methane being a greenhouse gas 27 times more potent than carbon dioxide, these emissions are often overlooked due to today’s measurement methods.

“Our measurements show that ship passages trigger clear pulses of high methane fluxes from the water to the atmosphere,” explained Amanda Nylund, researcher at Chalmers University of Technology and the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute, SMHI.

“Pressure changes and mixing of the water mass cause this. Even if the pulses are short, the total amount during a day is significant.”

Shipping emissions caused by fuel choices and high activity

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and concerns about methane emissions from the few ships that run on liquefied natural gas (LNG) are a very hot topic.

The study found that methane emissions in shipping are largely decoupled from the ships’ choice of fuel. This means that all ships can emit greenhouse gases, and shipping’s contribution to these emissions has previously been underestimated.

The researchers note that although methane is naturally present in the sediments, the activity of the ships leads to an extensive release into the atmosphere.

The study focuses on shallow marine areas where the sediments are oxygen-free and rich in organic matter. In such environments, methane is formed, and at high production levels, the gas can leak or bubble up into the water above.

When a ship passes, the pressure at the seafloor changes and methane bubbles make their way out of the sediments more easily.

In combination with the mixing that takes place in the wake of ships, the methane can quickly rise to the surface and escape into the atmosphere.

Impact of ships crucial for improving global methane estimates

The phenomenon of extensive methane emissions in shallow waters was first discovered by chance, in connection with other measurements in Neva Bay, part of the Baltic Sea.

“The discovery of the hitherto unknown impact of ships is important for improving global estimates of methane emissions, not least considering that nine of the world’s ten largest ports are located in waters with similar conditions as Neva Bay,” said Johan Mellqvist, Professor of Optical Remote Sensing, Chalmers, whose group made the unexpected discovery that forms the basis for the new results.

Two of the largest ship types, cruise and container ships, triggered the most frequent and largest measured methane releases; however, slightly smaller ropax vessels (which combine freight and passenger ferries) also account for significant methane releases.

The larger (compared to ropax and container) vessel type, bulk carriers, accounted for lower emissions. This means that it is more complicated than the size of the vessels controlling methane emissions in shipping.

“A possible explanation for the high emissions of ropax vessels is that they have double propellers,” commented Rickard Bensow, Professor of Hydrodynamics, Chalmers, and responsible for the study’s modelling of ship traffic.

Rethinking where methane measurements are carried out

The authors of the current study now emphasise the need to rethink how and where methane measurements are carried out, especially in coastal waters where natural and human factors interact. They place particular focus on further investigating large ports in river deltas.

Ida-Maja Hassellöv, Professor of Maritime Environmental Science, Chalmers, who will lead the follow-up project, concluded: “The next step is to estimate how large these effects can be globally. Major ports in China, Singapore, and South Korea, as well as European ports such as Rotterdam and Antwerp, and river systems in Germany, have similar conditions to those of the Neva Bay.

Planned ground testing will begin in Q3 2025, with flight trials scheduled for 2027 using Airbus’ A220 test aircraft. The Mirabel site at YMX International Aerocity, managed by Aéroports de Montréal (ADM), will provide infrastructure and operational support for CRYSTAL, one of the key projects under Espace Aero – the first official Quebec aerospace innovation zone project this year.

Collaboration and innovation

Including notable partners such as Polytechnique Montréal, École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS), and FSM Management Group, with additional engagement from national aerospace research programs such as INSAT (Initiative for Sustainable Aviation Technology) and CRIAQ (Consortium for Research and Innovation in Aerospace in Québec), the CRYSTAL consortium promises to create new pathways for clean propulsion research, fuel innovation, and data-driven emissions modeling that could directly influence the next generation of aircraft and propulsion systems. And, according to Mélanie Lussier, President of Aéro Montréal, it’s a collaboration that bolsters Quebec’s standing within the aerospace industry.

“Espace Aéro is proud to see a major project take shape with CRYSTAL, driven by Airbus’ leadership and its partners,” she says. “This collaborative initiative perfectly reflects our innovation zone’s commitment to decarbonization and showcases how Quebec’s ingenuity and innovation are helping to shape the sustainable aviation of tomorrow. By bringing together industrial and academic players around concrete solutions, we are strengthening Quebec’s position as a leader in aerospace environmental performance.”

Developing a better understanding

The CRYSTAL initiative is one that reflects a growing recognition concerning non-CO₂ impacts—including water vapor, aerosols and contrails—which may contribute significantly to aviation’s climate footprint. Yet, unlike carbon dioxide, these emissions are not currently regulated or fully understood. However, by producing high-resolution, real-world emissions data, CRYSTAL has the potential to refine climate models and inform future fuel specifications, engine designs and flight operations. In fact, it’s an undertaking that Catherine Guillemart, Head of Public Affairs and Sustainability, Canada, Airbus, suggests is critical to the future of aerospace innovation.

The Navy Hangar was originally part of a larger proposal to develop 46 acres of land along Hartwell Road into nearly 500,000 square feet of aircraft storage and maintenance space intended for private and corporate leasing.

While the project team has been working on a required supplement to their larger project Draft Environmental Impact Report to satisfy a Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act Office (MEPA) certificate issued a year ago, opportunities have evolved for the existing Navy Hangar space.

A Notice of Project Change (NPC) was filed with MEPA on June 2. Wednesday’s information session was one part of the proponent’s outreach on the project. A recording of the session is expected on the project website.

The information session included a presentation of the project by Rick Muse, North Airfield Ventures director of operations, and an overview of the contents and technical studies in the NPC by Lauren DeVoe, environmental review consultant with VHB.

The project plan is to renovate the Navy Hangar, empty for the past 20 years, consistent with Historic Preservation regulations. The hanger would be updated to be used for research and development, medical service, and specialty pharmaceutical delivery service.

A key interest in the project plans is Merlin Labs, an autonomous flight technology company, which plans to lease 70 to 80 percent of the Navy Hangar for their research and development headquarters. Merlin Labs plans to run one to two short duration experimental test flights per day with at least one human operator on board, according to the presentation.

Mark Ward, vice president of test flight operations at Merlin Labs, and one of Merlin’s pilots, said that test flights are planned to move “up and away” from heavily populated areas, as well as the Boston area congested air space. Ward stated that “flights can get to the New Hampshire shore in a dozen minutes or less.”

Most of the project area is already developed, according to DeVoe. The renovation and proposed use of the Navy Hangar space does not trigger a MEPA review, however a Phase One waiver is required to begin construction while the larger development project remains under review.

With Merlin Labs eager to begin in Bedford, plans, contractors, and funding sources are already in the works and awaiting approval expected at the end of August. The approval process will require a few more steps, including an additional public comment period, DeVoe explained. Muse estimates construction would take 10 to 12 months once started.

According to DeVoe’s presentation, an access way from Hartwell Road to a 140-space parking lot with 35 EV charging stations will be created, the current access ramp to an existing Hanscom Field runway will be reconfigured and updated, a small amount of wooded area will be cleared, and 1.35 acres of existing pavement will be replaced with a pervious surface.

The consultants anticipate “negligible” traffic impact to Hartwell Road, use of existing stormwater management, no significant noise impacts, “minimal” greenhouse gas emissions (772 short tons per year of CO2), and the use of sustainable design elements, including installing heat pumps and looking into rooftop solar installation. The team is also taking into consideration the proximity to the Superfund cleanup sites in the plans.

A handful of people commented and asked questions during the Q&A portion of the information session, with a few raising concerns over adding any amount of greenhouse gasses as the state, Bedford, and other neighboring towns work towards Net Zero. The team said that plans for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at Hanscom Field is in the near future (including in the larger project plan), and the use of clean or electric aircraft is not out of the question, but availability of that technology is not here yet.

Molly Haskell, a representative from the Bedford Arbor Resources Committee made a plea for “finessing” tree removal to safeguard any existing trees.

Russ Arena, executive director for Massachusetts Business Aviation Association (MBAA), commented that MBAA is very excited about the project. Arena was a chief pilot for Raytheon, one of the original tenants of the Navy Hangar, and is excited about the return of research and development and the renovation of the building. “I know there is negativity,” Arena said, but he called the project a “wonderful thing for the state, for the town, and for employment.”",https://cdn.thebedfordcitizen.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NavyHangar-Proposed-NPC.png,N,,2025-07-03 05:01:44.721144

BIO-BASED SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL (SAF) MARKET OVERVIEW

The global Bio-based Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Market was valued at USD 1.59 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow to USD 1.99 billion in 2025, reaching USD 27.49 billion by 2033, with a projected CAGR of about 25.7% during the forecast period 2025-2033.

Emerging importantly as the global game changers of aviation industry strategy for environmental footprint mitigation in global aviation, the market for bio based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). SAF is produced from renewable, biological sustainable sources including used cooking oil, Agri-wastes, MSW and non-food crops such as algae. SAF has the potential to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuel, subject to the feedstock and production method [1]. Aviation is responsible for about 2–3% globally of the total CO₂ emissions, it is of course going to have to clean up its acts more urgently than ever. SAF through mandates, tax credits and emission trading schemes have been supported by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and other bodies of regulation. The policy frameworks combined with consumer and environmental groups mounting pressure are already moving the needle for SAF technologies to be adopted and commercialized.

With the market maturing, there are various technological pathways, such as Hydro processed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), Fischer-Tropsch, and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) being scaled to widen the feed-stock conversion of aviation fuel pathways into closely-forced standards for jet fuel. The major fuel producers and also the major airlines are investing into purpose-built biorefineries plus long-term offtake contracts to secure more stable supply. The SAF market though has pile of challenges on its head. As production remains considerably expensive, unable to cross-the-horizon globally thus infrastructure limitations hampering large-scale deployment. Nevertheless, airline profitability, corporate sustainability targets and improved feedstock pathways & conversion efficiencies are predicted to support the growth of market over forecast period. Today, North America and Europe are the front-runners of the SAF development with their heavily industrialised areas and supportive regulatory set-ups, while Asia-Pacific is becoming more active driven by national governments and global alliances aiming at establishing regional supply chains. We have entered a new era of air travel, the bio-based SAF market is moving from niche to mainstream, serving as one of key in re-inventing sustainable flight.

COVID-19 IMPACT

Bio-based Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Industry Had a Negative Effect Due to Disrupted Air Travel and Delayed Investments during COVID-19 Pandemic

The global COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented and staggering, with the market experiencing lower-than-anticipated demand across all regions compared to pre-pandemic levels. The sudden market growth reflected by the rise in CAGR is attributable to the market’s growth and demand returning to pre-pandemic levels.

COVID-19 has affected the bio-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market with two-sided impacts. Lockdowns, travel restrictions and generally weak consumer demand severely affected short-run global commercial aviation in an unprecedented fashion. The significant decrease in air travel activity led to a contemporaneous decline in jet fuel demand of which SAF was included causing bottlenecks for SAF procurement contracts, project investments and infrastructure expansion plans. Many biofuel producers went off-road to automotive markets or halted production entirely because of financing challenges and ambiguous demand forecasts. Cash flow drag for airlines also constrained their ability and willingness to lock in more expensive sustainable fuels. However, in the longer run, the pandemic was a wake-up call for the aviation industry to speed up decarbonization and work on increased resilience. During the recovery packages and green transition incentives, SAF was rediscovered as a key lever for sustainable recovery. Airlines also announced new sustainability targets and net-zero emission time-frames with considerable attention being paid to their road maps and SAF. This reshaped the market dynamics by turning upside down priority for environmental responsibility and painted a collaborative picture of both fuel producers, as well as airlines & governments in achieving SAF production scaling up in post-COVID recovery era.

LATEST TRENDS

Airline-Producer Partnerships to Accelerate SAF Commercialization to Drive Market Growth

One of the major trends fuelling the bio-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market going forward is the increasing strategic partnerships among airlines and fuel producers to commercialize SAF as soon as possible. Regulatory bodies and global alliances moving regulatory decarbonization milestones fast, creating long-term offtake agreements with SAF producers so airlines have stable feedstock for low-emission fuels. Those partnerships are aimed at solving one of the biggest problems in industry capacity constraints by offering some level financial certainty and an incentive to build new biorefineries, and also bring innovation infeed stock. Also, such initiatives allow airlines in near term emissions reduction whilst future roadmap for their compliance with the enabling regulations mandating the proportion of SAF blending. These partnerships are also creating federations of research and development, where stakeholders investigate into the use of raw materials like algae and agricultural waste, municipal solid with an aim to decouple from current sources (used cooking oil) in part of the feedstock. In addition, fuel providers are collaborating closely with aviation suppliers to validate new production pathways and support the operational readiness of SAF in current aircraft and their infrastructure. That burgeoning ecosystem of cooperation not only speeds technology uptake, but says loud and clear to the aviation industry that its long-term commitment in sustainable fuel solutions is firmly anchored. This developing trend, as it progresses will undoubtedly drive increased market scalability by driving supply and cost reductions of SAF to create a secure, and sustainable aviation fuel supply chain.

BIO-BASED SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL (SAF) MARKET SEGMENTATION

BY TYPE

Based on type, the global market can be categorized into HEFA, G+FT, AtJ and other

HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids): HEFA is the most mainstream production pathway for SAF, it converts fats oils and grease to fossil-based jet fuel all renewable. With a high degree of compatibility with current aircraft engines and infrastructure, it has massive market growth.

G+FT (Gasification and Fischer-Tropsch): The gasification of biomass and waste feedstock followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthetic gas/pathway to produce so called bio-hydrocarbon. It allows a wide choice of feedstocks but needs more capital expenditure.

AtJ (Alcohol-to-Jet): AtJ technology is capable of turning alcohols e. g. ethanol or butanol into jet fuel. Because it is attracting more attention for processing agricultural residues and cellulosic biomass, with efforts scale-up intend to provide cost advantages.

Other: This includes still-developing routes such as pyrolysis and power-to-liquid processes, both in the embryonic stage but prospective diversification sources of SAF production in future.

BY APPLICATION

Based on application, the global market can be categorized into commercial aircraft, military aircraft and other

Commercial Aircraft: Largest application segments being powered by airlines commitment to reduce carbon emissions. Commercial aviation is increasingly blending SAF in-flight through blend standards and voluntary sustainability programs.

Military Aircraft: SAF used in the military aviation sector for improvement of energy security as well as reduction in carbon footprint with performance constancy. A number of defence agencies have launched initiatives to standardize and agree upon SAF for their respective fleets.

Other: This encompasses private jets, helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), where SAF uptake is just coming on the horizon, and thus far is a relatively new less dominant segment when compared to commercial and the military.

MARKET DYNAMICS

Market dynamics include driving and restraining factors, opportunities and challenges stating the market conditions.

DRIVING FACTORS

Increasing Regulatory Support and Environmental Mandates to Boost the Market

The most important driver for the rising bio-based sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) market growth is the huge regulatory backing and global environmental standards. A number of policies at the initiative of governments, aviation regulatory bodies and international organizations to hasten decarbonization to clean jet fuels from fossil-based origins. These involve blending mandates that compel airlines to use a certain volume of SAF in their fuel mix, carbon pricing mechanisms and producer/consumer financial burden reducing tax relief for sustainable fuels. Moreover, emission trading schemes and carbon offset programs create the economic imperative for airlines to seek cleaner fuels as they begin to monetize reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. In aggregate, this regulatory landscape creates the critical mass of investment in SAF production infrastructure and drives innovation in feedstock diversification and conversion technologies. While North America, and Europe are front-runners by most ergo have seen one of the biggest increases in bio-based SAF market share in these regions as a result of stringent policies to enable SAF commercialisation. This regulatory landscape not only drives market growth, but also reinforces global sustainability yields by setting aviation sector goals in line with broader climate targets and increases stakeholder certainty enabling widespread adoption of SAF.

Rising Airline Commitments to Carbon Neutrality to Expand the Market

The bio-based sustainable aviation fuels market is expected to gain power since the number of airline commitments focus on carbon-neutral growth and net-zero emissions often sounds louder. Given the central role they play in global emissions, many of today leading airlines have set very far-reaching environmental targets to at least halve their carbon emissions by 2030, 2040 or until mid-century at the latest. Such commitments typically require SAF to be incorporated into an integrated strategy that overtakes or substitutes conventional jet fuel because of its substantial carbon saving capacity. Long-term offtake agreements among airlines and fuel producers offer financial certainty as well as incentives to build new biorefineries, lead additional work on scaling existing facilities to secure a long-term supply of SAF. In addition to buying agreements, airlines are cooperating with fuel developers on joint R&D projects to optimize feedstock utilization as well as drive down production costs. Increasing consumer, investor and regulatory pressure on the industry only adds to sense of urgency that airlines are under in order to put sustainable fuel solutions into practice. This increases market for SAF, with the growing demand coupled by this holistic focus on SAF are spurring technological advancements and market expansion as well as increasing OEM acceptance in the aviation industry as ending pathway for bio-based SAF integral part of future sustainable air travel.

RESTRAINING FACTOR

High Production Costs and Feedstock Limitations to Potentially Impede Market Growth

One major inventory constraint on the expansion of bio-based sustainable aviation fuel market is high production costs of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel. Constraining factors, i.e., complex conversion processes and costly feedstocks along inelastic supply chains keep prices disproportionately high for SAF to be competitive without subsidies or regulatory support. Another difficulty in the way is feedstock availability and sustainability. For many bio-based feedstocks such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, among others volumes are largely restricted by competition from other industries and must be priced to offset the higher cost. Additionally, land use change, land competition for food and environmental impacts of some biomass sources limit large-scale feedstock expansion. Each of these contributes to the added complexity of production and further complicates the ability for producers to scale up their operations effectively. This creates further impediments on market penetration through, significant capital investment required for new biorefineries and infrastructure and supply chain uncertainties. As long as production costs are high and there is none-to-generally accepted diversity of feedstock types the bio-based sustainable aviation fuel market will face hurdles to reach large scale commercialization cost competitiveness vis-a-vis fossil-based jet fuels.

One such incentive is the 45Z tax credit, designed to spur the ramp up of American-made clean transportation fuel production.
Congress has a unique opportunity to step in and bolster American manufacturing and energy security – but it can and must act today.","While our international competitors race ahead in biomanufacturing, America’s $210 billion bioeconomy remains at risk. The U.S. has the tools to outcompete China, unleash a manufacturing boom, and achieve energy security—all within its reach today.

But regulatory delays and uncertain tax policy at the federal level are thwarting the ability of innovators to scale these critical American-made industries. In the case of sustainable aviation fuel, these failures are particularly magnified given the ongoing unpredictability surrounding a federal tax credit called Section 45Z.

Bioindustrials represent a revolution in American manufacturing, including fuel production. Unlike traditional manufacturing, bioindustrials leverage microorganisms, like yeast, to harness the power of domestic feedstocks, like corn and soy. These inputs undergo precision fermentation in state-of-the-art bioreactors before being transformed into a range of high-end products, including biofuels that can power our homes, cars, and even U.S. Air Force jets.

For American farmers and ranchers, these biobased markets offer a critical lifeline at a time when they face an unprecedented number of challenges. Agricultural feedstocks not only unlock additional revenue streams for growers but also provide an energy source that’s uniquely rooted in U.S. agriculture. This could mean American energy dominance achieved through a robust biobased economy right here at home.

To put that in perspective, the U.S. stands to unlock $400 billion in the next five years through food, agriculture, and manufacturing biotechnologies alone. Unfortunately, much of the progress achieved thus far and the future ahead are at serious risk today—unless Congress takes action to help build the infrastructure needed to deploy these technologies at scale.

As it stands, American biomanufacturing capacity is falling behind our competitors. One challenge facing pioneers at home is the cost and time it takes to scale current technologies. Commercial-scale facilities can take two to five years to build and cost up to $2 billion. For many early-stage companies, this represents a significant barrier on top of the costs needed to navigate a complicated and frequently duplicative oversight system and lengthy and costly review processes.

Overcoming these challenges is possible—especially with targeted tax incentives that can help ramp up production capacity. One such incentive is the 45Z tax credit, designed to spur the ramp up of American-made clean transportation fuel production. Unfortunately, the incentive is stuck in limbo as part of Congress’s larger tax policy overhaul.

While there is bicameral support for 45Z’s extension until 2031, several limitations remain in current budget reconciliation proposals. Many of these restrictions, such as capping the dollar value of some fuels or phasing out the transferability of the credit early, will do more harm than good.

In fact, adding burden in a sector where cost barriers to scale are already high would likely drive smaller companies and startups out of business. That would mean the death of the very engine of American innovation and bioindustrial growth, and with it, the nation’s global leadership in this growing sector.

The best way forward is the one that keeps America leading on bioindustrials both today and in the future. Before the bill is finalized, Congress must ensure that the 45Z tax credit is not only maintained for its full tax rate in the long term but also that it remains accessible and usable to a wide array of feedstocks. This would guarantee that the tax credit delivers clear, direct benefits to U.S. farmers and rural economies while providing the bioindustrial sector with the necessary certainty to ensure its future is proudly made in America.

Congress has a unique opportunity to step in and bolster American manufacturing and energy security – but it can and must act today.

On July 1, the Senate approved its version of the multi-trillion dollar reconciliation bill (“Senate bill”) known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). OBBBA is a reconciliation bill that includes budgetary provisions relating to the border, defense, energy policy, spending cuts, the debt ceiling, and taxes that were approved. The Senate bill passed by a vote of 51-50, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie. The bill will now be reconsidered by the House before final passage. It extends or makes permanent many of the provisions contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), meets many of the tax campaign promises made by President Trump, and adds additional tax provisions, which are summarized more fully below. The bill passed using the current policy as a baseline, which means it will cost $3.8 trillion over 10 years.

Provisions Affecting Businesses

Research and Experimentation (R&E) Deductions: The TCJA required taxpayers to capitalize and amortize domestic R&E over five years, using a midyear convention. Foreign R&E is required to be amortized over 15 years.

OBBBA permanently allows immediate deductibility of R&E expenses rather than five-year amortization for R&E beginning after Dec. 31, 2024. Businesses with annual gross receipts of $31 million or less are allowed to apply this change retroactively for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2021. This means businesses could amend returns and potentially get refunds. Taxpayers with domestic R&E expenses incurred after Dec. 31, 2021, and Jan. 21, 2025, can elect to accelerate the remaining deductions over a one- or two-year period. Foreign R&E remains subject to 15-year amortization.

The Senate bill creates new IRC Section 174A, which would permanently allow taxpayers to either deduct domestic research or experimental expenditures or elect to capitalize and recover domestic research or experimental expenditures ratably over at least 60 months, beginning with the month in which the taxpayer first realizes benefits from those expenditures.

Amounts incurred for the development of software are included in the definition of R&E expenses.

Taxpayers should review their specific tax situations to determine which option may produce the best result. For example, deducting the expenses in the year incurred may not generate the best tax result if it generates excess business losses under IRC section 461(l).

OBBBA also includes rules to coordinate the immediate deductibility of R&E with the research credit.

Bonus Depreciation: OBBBA makes the first-year bonus depreciation provisions of section 168(k) permanent. The allowance is increased to 100% for property acquired and placed in service after Jan. 19, 2025. These provisions allow businesses a continued favorable expense deduction timing for property types that qualify under section 168. The Senate bill allows immediate deductions for domestic R&E expenses, maintains 15-year amortization of foreign expenses starting in 2025, and provides the possibility of amended returns to claim refunds for two prior years. Special transition rules for small business taxpayers (gross receipts $31 million or less) apply, including election to make or revoke the reduced Section 41 research credit under section 280C(c)(2) on an amended return.

Qualified Production Property: Manufacturers can claim 100% deduction for the cost of new “qualified production property,” including real property, defined as any property used in a “qualified production activity” (“the manufacturing, production, or refining of a qualified product” which “result[s] in a substantial transformation of the property comprising the product.”). A “qualified product” means any tangible personal property if such property is not a food or beverage prepared in the same building as a retail establishment in which such property is sold. It applies to non-residential real property other than “real property which is used for offices, administrative services, lodging, parking, sales activities, research activities, software development or engineering activities, or other functions unrelated to the manufacturing, production, or refining of tangible personal property.” The change applies to qualified property placed in service after the date of enactment and before Jan. 1, 2031.

Business Interest Limitation: OBBBA reinstates the section 163(j) interest deduction limitation using a calculation of income that excludes the deduction for depreciation, amortization, or depletion. The provision is for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2024. The Senate bill permanently modifies the definition of “motor vehicle” for purposes of the floor plan financing interest and floor plan financing indebtedness definitions. The Senate bill contains a new ordering rule to calculate 163(j) limit prior to other interest capitalization. In addition, interest capitalized under sections 263(g) or 263A(f) is not deemed interest for the limitation. Subpart F, GILTI, and section 78 gross-ups are excluded from taxable income for purposes of the calculation.

Similar to bonus depreciation, there is bipartisan support for the extension of changes to the section 163(j) interest limitation, as it was previously included in the H.R. 7024 bipartisan legislation in 2024.

Excess Business Losses Limitation: The Excess Business Loss (EBL) rule applies to non-corporate taxpayers and is defined as the amount by which deductions (excluding net operating losses and IRC section 199A Qualified Business Income deductions) related to trades or businesses exceed income from such trade or business. Such net business losses are currently allowed only up to certain thresholds (which for 2025 are $626,000 for joint filers and $313,000 for other filers). Any business losses above these thresholds are EBLs. Any disallowed EBL is carried forward and is treated as a net operating loss in future years, subject to an 80% of taxable income limitation.

Under current law, the EBL rules are scheduled to expire after 2029. The OBBBA makes the EBL rule permanent for years after 2029.

Limit on Executive Compensation: OBBBA provides an aggregation rule to section 163(m) and provides a deduction limit of $1 million for total payments of a controlled group of corporations.

Employee Retention Tax Credit: OBBBA retroactively bars the IRS from issuing refunds for Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) claims for Q3 2021 (and in some instances Q4 2021 (collectively, “affected quarters”) filed after Jan. 31, 2024. The bill also would require ERTC promoters to comply with due diligence requirements with respect to a taxpayer’s eligibility and the amount of an ERTC for affected quarters. In addition, the bill provides a $1,000 penalty for each failure to comply, and it would also extend the penalty for excessive refund claims to employment tax refund claims.

Some commentators have raised doubts about whether such retroactive legislation satisfies constitutional standards. Meanwhile, employers with legitimate ERTC claims for any eligible quarter were already severely disadvantaged by the IRS processing moratorium simply because their claims were submitted on or after Jan. 31, 2024. These employers rightfully feel short-changed, as they submitted legitimate ERTC claims well within the statute of limitations for filing claims. Under current law, taxpayers had until April 15, 2025, to submit claims for 2021 ERTC refunds. Adding insult to injury, many employers have already paid additional income tax by amending their income tax returns, as required, to account for the effects of the ERTC claim while still waiting for their ERTC refunds.

Employers may wish to speak with their legal counsel to evaluate other options that could compel the U.S. government to finally process and pay their refund claim. In October 2024, the IRS extended the time to appeal denial letters beyond the typical 30-day period to the entire two years after the date of the denial letter. However, an appeal will not extend the time to file a refund suit, so taxpayers must be vigilant not to let that deadline pass. Employers may also want to consider filing “protective claims for refund” that would allow them to recoup the additional income tax they paid in anticipation of their ERTC refund in the event the IRS denies some part or all of the ERTC refund after the statute of limitations expires on claiming the associated income tax refund expires. OBBBA extends the amount of time that the IRS has to examine and deny or claw back erroneous or excessive ERTC claims for affected quarters from five years to six years. Also, for employers who claimed the ERTC in 2020 or 2021for affected quarters, but have not amended their tax returns for those years, the IRS will have six years to assess additional tax related to the wage deductions related to the ERTC claims.

Because the Senate bill only changes section 3134, which only applies to the affected quarters, taxpayers may still be able to claim refunds and assert statute of limitations defenses to ERTC claims filed for other quarters.

Payments from Partnerships to Partners: OBBBA makes section 707(a)(2), which addresses payments from partnerships to partners acting other than in the capacity of a partner with respect to services or contributions, self-enacting. Under current law, this type of transaction requires IRS regulations to implement its provisions. This provision is not retroactive, but it is not intended to change the substance of the current law.

Clean Energy: OBBBA makes significant changes that mostly eliminate clean energy credits, with modifications generally based on timing and reduced amounts.

The clean vehicle credit under section 30D is repealed for vehicles acquired more than 180 days after date of enactment. The credit for qualified commercial clean vehicles under section 45W is generally repealed for vehicles acquired more than 180 days after enactment, with vehicles under 14,000 pounds subject to critical mineral and battery component restrictions in section 30D after June 16, 2025. The alternative fuel refueling property credit in section 30C is repealed for property placed in service after date of enactment. The Senate bill also terminates section 179D deduction for energy efficient commercial buildings that begin construction more than 12 months after enactment date.

OBBBA repeals the special five-year cost recovery period in section 168(e)(3)(B) for energy property in sections 45Y(b)(1)(A), 48E(b)(2), and 48E(c)(2) that are placed in service after the enactment date. A last-minute amendment removed a new excise tax and eased some restrictions on the placed-in-service dates.

Under OBBBA, the credit for wind and solar facilities is reduced to 60% of the otherwise available credit for construction beginning in 2026, 20% for construction beginning in 2027, and 0% beginning for 2028. Eliminated the “later of” rule to start phase down and termination of the credit after 2032 and also denies credit for facilities that received material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity. The Senate bill also disallows credit for wind and solar leasing arrangements.

With respect to carbon sequestration under section 45Q the Senate bill prohibits certain foreign entities from claiming credit beginning the year of enactment. For facilities placed in service after 2022, it enacts a parity credit value of $17 regardless of end use and indexes for inflation. In addition, the Senate bill retains the $36 credit for direct air capture and retains transferability.

OBBBA denies credits for zero-emission nuclear power production under section 45U for taxpayers that are specified foreign entities beginning on the date of enactment. It also denies credit for foreign-influenced taxpayers two years after enactment. It further denies credit for facilities that use nuclear fuel provided by a covered nation or entity (after Jan. 31, 2027) unless a binding written contract was in effect before Jan. 1, 2023.

The section 45V credit for production of clean hydrogen is repealed for facilities that begin construction after Jan. 31, 2025.

The credit in section 45X for advanced manufacturing production adds a new phaseout for critical minerals at 75% for 2031, 50% in 2032, and 25% in 2033. No credit is allowed after 2033. Wind energy components produced and sold after Jan. 31, 2027, are denied. Foreign entity and material assistance restrictions also apply, and transferability is retained.

OBBBA extends the clean fuel production credit under section 45Z through 2031. However, it restricts the credit for certain foreign entities, precludes the credit for entities claiming the sustainable aviation fuel credit, and eliminates section 6426(k) credits after Sept. 30, 2025. Under the Senate bill, fuel producers can utilize feedstock produced anywhere, but the value of the 45Z credit is reduced by 20% for fuel produced from feedstocks produced or grown outside the U.S., effective Jan. 1, 2026. The Senate bill also eliminates the “special rate” of the credit currently available for SAF. The change would essentially cap the value of the credit at $1 per gallon for all eligible fuels, including SAF. Currently, SAF is eligible for a credit of up to $1.75 per gallon.

Qualified Opportunity Zones (OZ): OBBBA includes a permanent rolling 10-year designation beginning Jan. 1, 2027, maintains the current OZ designation process, and provides strengthened eligibility requirements.

New Market Tax Credits: OBBBA makes these credits permanent.

Employer-provided Child Care: OBBBA permanently increases the credit to help all businesses cover more of the costs of providing child care or supporting employee access to child care services. Additionally, the bill creates a boost for small businesses specifically to help offset a greater portion of the cost. Businesses are provided an increased percentage of qualified expenses of 40%, with a $500,000 cap. Small businesses (gross receipts under $31 million) are given a 50% rate for qualifying expenses with $600,000 maximum credit.

Provisions Affecting Individuals

Tax Rates: OBBBA makes the regular income tax rate schedules under section 1 permanent for individuals as enacted by the TCJA, which generally modifies the indexing for inflation for bracket thresholds by providing one additional year of inflation in the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). The COLA for regular income tax brackets for 2026 is generally the percentage by which the chained CPI for 2025 exceeds the chained CPI for 2016. The result is that the bracket thresholds are larger than they would otherwise be without the additional year of inflation. These changes both cement current tax rate brackets and provide a more favorable COLA for future years. The Senate bill also provides inflation adjustments for the 10% and 12% brackets.

Standard Deduction: OBBBA makes the temporary increases to the standard deduction permanent as enacted under section 63 of the TCJA and modifies the inflation indexing of the standard deduction by adding one additional year of inflation in the COLA starting in taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025. OBBBA also increases the amount of the standard deduction in taxable years beginning after 2025. Starting in 2025, the standard deduction will increase to $15,750 for individual filers and $31,500 for joint filers, which are adjusted for inflation.

Personal Exemption: OBBBA makes permanent the personal exemption in section 151 that was temporarily reduced to zero under the TCJA.

SALT Cap: Under prior TCJA provisions, individuals who itemize deductions may only deduct up to $10,000 in state, local, and foreign income, property, or sales and use taxes (the SALT cap). In the past several years, most states with an individual income tax have enacted laws that allow owners of pass-through entities to legitimately work around this limit by imposing an entity-level tax on the business.

OBBBA increases the limit to $40,000 with phase outs beginning at $500,000 of income. The increase is only temporary for five years. In 2026, the thresholds would increase by 1% or to $40,400 for households with income under $505,000. The thresholds would continue to increase by 1% each year through 2029, after which the SALT limit would be permanently reduced to $10,000.

Pass-Through Entity Tax (PTET) Deduction: Unlike the House-passed version of H.R. 1, the Senate bill essentially maintains the status quo with respect to PTET deductions. The House version repealed the PTET deduction for specified service trades or businesses and placed restrictions which could limit the deduction by one-half or even more in certain circumstances.

Section 1202 Small Business Stock: OBBBA provides tiered gain exclusion for qualified small business stock (QSBS) of 50% for QSBS held for at least three years, 75% for QSBS held for at least four years, and 100% for QSBS held for at least five years. The change only applies to stock originally issued after the date of enactment. The gain excluded under the three- and four-year rules would not be treated as a preference item for purposes of the AMT if the stock were to be acquired after Sept. 27, 2010.

The per-issuer cumulative exclusion limitation increases from $10 million to $15 million, with an annual inflation adjustment increase. Taxpayers that fully use the limitation as inflation adjusted in any tax year are not eligible for additional inflation adjustments. The conforming amendments ensure married filing separate taxpayers benefit from the adjusted inflation limitations on a per-issuer basis. In addition, OBBBA would increase the “aggregate gross asset” calculation under IRC Section 1202(d) to $75 million from $50 million, that is also subject to an annual inflation adjustment.

Sec 199A Qualified Business Income (QBI) Deduction: OBBBA makes the QBI deduction, which was scheduled to expire after 2025, permanent. It also makes a number of other structural changes to the law for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025. While the House version raised the deduction to 23%, the Senate version returns it to 20% while expanding the limit phase-in range.

Charitable Contributions: The Senate bill creates a permanent deduction for taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions. For tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025, non-itemizing taxpayers can claim a deduction of up to $1,000 if a single filer ($2,000, married filing jointly) for certain charitable contributions.

For taxpayers who itemize their deductions, the Senate bill would limit otherwise allowable charitable contribution deductions to amounts in excess of a 0.5% floor over the contribution base (generally, adjusted gross income without regard to net operating losses) for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025. New carryover rules apply to amounts not entitled to be deducted. The Senate Bill also permanently extends the increased 60% contribution limit for cash gifts to qualified charities.

Child Tax Credit: OBBBA increases and extends the child tax credit under section 24(h). A maximum child tax credit of $2,200 is allowed for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2024.

AMT Exemption: The Senate Bill follows H.R. 1 with some language variations on the inflation adjustment. The sunsetting provisions of the individual AMT exemption amounts and phase-out thresholds under section 55A are repealed in the Senate bill, and the TCJA exemptions amounts are made permanent. This means that taxpayers who would have been subject to an increased additional alternative minimum tax will now continue to have the higher exemption levels previously provided by TCJA.

Limitation of Tax Benefit of Itemized Deductions: OBBBA permanently repeals the “Pease” limitation on itemized deductions and creates a new formula to apply to taxpayers only in the highest tax bracket, generally capping the benefit of otherwise allowable itemized deductions at 35%.

Repeal of Certain Miscellaneous Itemized Deductions: OBBBA permanently suspends certain miscellaneous itemized deductions that were scheduled to expire under TCJA. These include unreimbursed employee expenses, investment advisory fees, tax preparation fees, certain legal fees, hobby expenses, and safe deposit box rentals. However, OBBBA removes unreimbursed expenses for eligible educators from the list.

Loan Limit on Interest Deduction on Principal Residence: The Senate bill follows H.R. 1 but the $750,000 ($375,000 married individual filing separately) limit on principal residence acquisition indebtedness under section 163(h), scheduled to expire under TCJA, is made permanent, as is the exclusion of interest on home equity indebtedness from the definition of qualified residence interest. This provision may limit tax benefits for taxpayers facing rising housing prices and interest rates. OBBBA allows certain mortgage insurance premiums to qualify as deductible interest.

Personal Casualty Losses: The temporary limitation on personal casualty losses in section 165(h)(5) under TCJA is made permanent and includes state declared disasters. TCJA allowed an individual taxpayer to claim an itemized deduction for a personal casualty loss if the loss is attributable to a declared federal disaster area. A loss is deductible only to the extent of the sum of the individual’s personal casualty gains plus the amount by which aggregate net disaster-related losses exceed 10% of the individual taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. For individual taxpayers, personal casualty losses are losses of property not connected with a trade or business, or a transaction entered into for profit, if such losses arise from fire, storm, shipwreck, other casualty, or theft. Personal casualty losses are deductible to the extent they exceed $100 per casualty.

Wagering Losses: OBBBA allows deductible expenses incurred in gambling activity beyond 2025 but limits the losses to 90% of the amount in excess of gains from the taxable year.

Moving Expenses: The Senate bill would permanently repeal the deduction for moving expenses under section 217(k), except in the case of a member of the Armed Forces (or their spouse or child) to whom section 217(g) applies. The bill would also permanently repeal the qualified moving expense reimbursement exclusion under 132(g)(2), except in the case of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States on active duty who moves pursuant to a military order and incident to a permanent change of station.

Tip Income: OBBBA allows an above-the-line deduction for tip income with phaseout amounts beginning at $150,000 ($300,000 married filing jointly) for tax years 2025 through 2028. This applies to both employees and independent contractors in industries that customarily receive this income. A list of eligible industries will be provided by the Treasury.

New Deduction for Seniors: OBBBA increases the House temporary bonus deduction to $6,000 under section 63(f) for all individuals who have attained age 65 (and for each spouse meeting the applicable criteria in the case of a joint return). The bill allows a deduction for taxable years 2025 through 2028 beginning after Dec. 31, 2024, and before Jan. 1, 2029. This additional amount is $6,000 per individual and phases out for taxpayers with income over a threshold amount of $150,000 for taxpayers filing jointly and $75,000 for all other taxpayers.

Overtime Pay: For taxable years 2025 through 2028, OBBBA provides a deduction for qualified overtime pay of $12,500 ($25,000 for married filing joint filers). Qualified overtime compensation is overtime compensation paid to an individual required under section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) in excess of the regular rate at which such individual is employed. The deduction phases out for AGI over $150,000 ($300,000 for married filing joint filers).

Interest on Domestic Auto Purchases: For taxable years 2025 through 2028, a deduction is allowed for qualified passenger vehicle loan interest. Individuals are allowed an above-the-line deduction for interest on loans used to purchase American-made cars. The deduction is capped at $10,000, with income phase-outs starting at $100,000 (single filers) and $200,000 (married filing joint filers). OBBBA requires a VIN number and excludes campers and RVs.

Clean Energy: The Senate bill terminates several individual credits, including the clean vehicle credits for new and previously owned motor vehicles, the energy efficient home improvement credit, the residential clean energy credit, and the new energy efficient home credit. The repeal is effective 180 days from the date of enactment, except for the new energy efficient home credit, which is effective 12 months from the date of enactment.

Family Medical Leave and Adoption Credit: OBBBA makes the family medical leave credit available to business under section 45S permanent, makes the cost of family leave insurance eligible for the credit, and lowers the eligible employee tenure from 12 to 6 months. OBBBA makes the adoption tax credit partially refundable up to $5,000 and indexed for inflation beginning in tax years starting after Dec. 31, 2024. The refundable portion of the credit cannot be carried forward.

Section 529 Accounts: OBBBA would allow tax-exempt distributions from Sec. 529 savings plans to be used for additional educational expenses in connection with enrollment or attendance at an elementary or secondary school. The bill would also allow tax-exempt distributions from 529 savings plans to be used for additional qualified higher education expenses, including “qualified postsecondary credentialing expenses.”

Trump Accounts: OBBBA creates Trump accounts that allow parents to open accounts for children under 8. Parents and others can contribute up to $5,000 annually (adjusted for inflation) until the beneficiary turns 18. The accounts enjoy preferential tax treatment when amounts are spent on certain qualifying expenses. The trustee can access the account after reaching age 18 and has until age 31 to use the funds in a tax-advantaged manner. OBBBA also provides a pilot federal government complementary contribution of a one-time transfer of $1,000 into Trump accounts for children born between 2025 and 2028. To be eligible, the child needs to be a U.S. citizen at birth with an SSN which must be provided. There are no income limits or phaseouts.

Provisions Affecting Colleges and Universities

Excise Tax on Colleges and Universities: The TCJA required certain colleges and universities with at least 500 students paying tuition and endowments exceeding $500,000 per student to pay an excise tax of 1.4% of their net investment income for the year. This is a flat rate for these institutions. In determining the per student amount, assets which are used directly for educational purposes are excluded.

OBBBA creates a tiered system that ranges from 1.4% to 8%. The rate depends on the ratio of the institution’s assets to students.

Student-Endowment Ratio of up to $500,000 – no excise tax applies

Student-Endowment Ratio of $500,001 to $750,000 – 1.4%

Student-Endowment Ratio of $750,001 to $2,000,000 – 4%

Student-Endowment Ratio of over $2,000,000 – 8%

An applicable education institution must have at least 3,000 tuition-paying students in a prior year, have more that 50% tuition-paying students located in the U.S., not be a state college or university, not be a qualified religious institution, and the student-adjusted endowment is at least $500,000.

Provisions Affecting Trusts, Estates, and Gifts

Tax Rates: The income tax rates and brackets for estates and trusts enacted in the TCJA are made permanent with modifications for inflation. To the extent possible, taxpayers may wish to revisit their estate and trust planning for this change, along with the increased exemption.

Exemption: The unified estate and gift tax exemption is made permanent to an inflation-indexed $15 million per individual for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025. The generation-skipping transfer tax exemption is also permanently increased to an inflation-indexed $15 million. The $15 million exemption amount is indexed for inflation with a base year of 2025. Accordingly, the exemption amount is $15 million for decedents dying and gifts made in calendar year 2026 and increases with inflation thereafter. Taxpayers may want to revisit their estate and gift planning in light of these changes.

Provisions Affecting Businesses with International Operations

Global Intangible Low-taxed Income (GILTI): OBBBA modifies the section 250 deduction for GILTI to 40%. The foreign tax credit reduction is 10%. This results in an effective tax rate on GILTI to 14%, higher than the 10.668% effective rate proposed by the House version of H.R. 1. The deduction for QBAI in determining a U.S. shareholder’s GILTI inclusion is eliminated. In addition, the allocation of expenses is limited (before foreign tax credits) for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025.

Foreign-derived Intangible Income (FDII): Similarly, for domestic corporations, OBBBA reduces to 33.34% the currently applicable 37.5% deduction for FDII, which was scheduled to decline to 21.875% after 2025. Therefore, the effective tax rate on FDII is slightly increased to 14%, consistent with GILTI. As under GILTI, Qualified Business Asset Investment (QBAI) is eliminated in determining the FDII deduction. In addition, the allocation and apportionment of expenses is limited to directly related expenses. Furthermore, deduction eligible income (DEI) would not include gains from the sale or other disposition of property that gives rise to rents or royalties.

Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax (BEAT): OBBBA permanently increases the BEAT rate from 10% to 10.5%. These changes to the BEAT provisions apply to taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025.

Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) Provisions: OBBBA adds a number of CFC provisions not contained in H.R. 1, including making the CFC look through rule permanent, repealing the 1 month deferral in section 898(c), reinstating section 958(b)(4) to prevent downward attribution from a foreign person to a U.S. person in determining CFC status, adding section 951B to cause certain foreign corporations to be treated as CFCs, and amending the pro rata share rules under section 951A.

Foreign Tax Credits: For section 904 calculation purposes, income from the sale of U.S. produced inventory attributable to an office or other fixed place of business outside the U.S. is foreign source income up to 50% of the total taxable income from the sale.

Provisions that did not make it into OBBBA

There are a number of provisions that were not included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Those provisions include lower corporate tax rates (including the 15% rate for domestic manufacturers, increased tax rates for high-income individuals making over $2.5 million annually, the taxation of partnership carried interests, and a corporate SALT cap. In addition, the Senate bill did not include language on some provisions in H.R. 1. Those include the section 899 “Revenge Tax,” legacy section 48 credit, adjustments to section 197 asset basis for sports teams, modification of the section 856 REIT subsidiary, an increased excise tax on private foundations, changes to UBIT, health reimbursement arrangements, cafeteria plans, and employer credit for CHOICE arrangements.

Conclusion

The changes made by the One Big Beautiful Act are significant and will require ongoing examination and planning opportunities.

Now British Airways joins EcoCeres in a strategic move to accelerate the transition toward sustainable air travel by securing a long-term supply of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This partnership reflects British Airways’ commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and achieving its goal of powering 10% of its flights with SAF by 2030. By teaming up with Hong Kong-based EcoCeres, which operates an advanced SAF production facility in Jiangsu, China, the airline is reinforcing its global sustainability strategy and supporting innovation in cleaner aviation fuels that significantly cut emissions compared to traditional jet fuel.

British Airways Signs Landmark Sustainable Aviation Fuel Deal with EcoCeres to Slash Emissions by 400,000 Tonnes

British Airways (BA) has taken a major step toward its climate goals by entering a significant new partnership with alternative aviation fuel pioneer EcoCeres. This long-term agreement marks a strategic push by the UK’s flag carrier to dramatically reduce carbon emissions from its operations by ramping up the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Under this newly signed multi-year agreement, Hong Kong-based EcoCeres will supply British Airways with SAF sourced from its advanced production facility in Jiangsu, China. The airline aims to use the fuel to help meet its ambitious target of powering at least 10% of its flights with sustainable fuel by 2030 — a move that reflects growing momentum in the aviation sector to transition toward cleaner energy sources.

A Bold Step Towards Cleaner Skies

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is made from non-fossil sources such as waste oils, agricultural residues, and non-edible biomass. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF has the potential to reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80%, depending on the feedstock and production methods used. British Airways’ deal with EcoCeres is expected to cut emissions by approximately 400,000 metric tonnes, based on the lifecycle of the SAF when compared to traditional fossil-based jet fuel.

To put that into perspective, the emissions saved through this supply deal are equivalent to the carbon produced by 240,000 roundtrip economy passengers flying between London and New York — a staggering figure that underscores the potential of SAF in supporting aviation’s sustainability goals.

EcoCeres: A Key Partner in Asia’s Green Aviation Push

EcoCeres, headquartered in Hong Kong, is at the forefront of renewable fuel innovation in Asia. The company specializes in converting waste-based biomass into high-value biofuels, including SAF. Its Jiangsu facility is equipped with cutting-edge technology designed for large-scale SAF production that meets international safety and quality standards.

The partnership with British Airways elevates EcoCeres’ profile as a reliable SAF supplier to leading global carriers. The company expressed its commitment to supporting the airline’s journey to net-zero carbon emissions through scalable, low-carbon fuel solutions.

In an official statement, EcoCeres emphasized the significance of the agreement as a milestone in expanding the global SAF supply chain and strengthening international cooperation in tackling climate change.

BA’s SAF Commitment: Beyond a Single Partnership

British Airways’ collaboration with EcoCeres is part of a broader strategy by its parent company, International Airlines Group (IAG), which has pledged to invest $865 million in sustainable aviation fuels over the next decade. The airline has also partnered with other SAF producers including LanzaJet, which is developing facilities in the UK and the US.

LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Georgia, USA, is considered a breakthrough project, and British Airways is backing a similar initiative in the UK. These ventures aim to produce SAF at commercial scale using ethanol derived from agricultural waste and other renewable sources.

By expanding its SAF supplier network to include Asia-based producers like EcoCeres, British Airways is not only diversifying its energy mix but also helping to accelerate global SAF production capacity — a critical factor in driving down costs and making the fuel more accessible across the industry.

Why SAF Matters for Aviation’s Climate Strategy

The aviation sector contributes approximately 2-3% of global CO₂ emissions, and that share is expected to rise without meaningful decarbonization. With limited near-term options for electrification or hydrogen-based propulsion in long-haul flights, SAF is widely regarded as the most viable solution available today to lower the environmental impact of flying.

However, SAF currently represents less than 0.1% of global jet fuel consumption, primarily due to high production costs and limited infrastructure. Deals like the one between British Airways and EcoCeres are crucial in signaling long-term demand, encouraging investment in new refineries, and prompting governments to establish favorable policy frameworks.

Scaling Production and Encouraging Adoption

One of the key obstacles in scaling SAF usage is supply. While technological readiness has improved, producers still face challenges in scaling feedstock collection, refining capacity, and certification processes. British Airways’ commitment to working with multiple SAF developers shows a clear strategy of reducing risk and ensuring future availability.

As demand for air travel continues to rebound, the pressure on airlines to deliver emissions reductions without compromising capacity or network reach has intensified. By securing long-term SAF agreements now, British Airways is not only preparing for regulatory changes and potential fuel mandates, but also positioning itself as a leader in sustainable aviation.

A Model for Global Carriers

British Airways’ SAF partnership with EcoCeres sets a strong example for other international carriers looking to deepen their environmental commitments. While government policies like the UK’s “Jet Zero” strategy are pushing for a net-zero aviation sector by 2050, the onus still falls heavily on individual airlines to invest in innovation and seek out credible partners.

This deal may also have a ripple effect across Asia and Europe, encouraging more cross-border collaborations in renewable aviation fuels. Given the scale of emissions involved, the transition to SAF must be global, and partnerships like BA-EcoCeres highlight how cooperation across continents can yield tangible climate benefits.

Conclusion

British Airways’ latest move to secure Sustainable Aviation Fuel from EcoCeres represents more than just a supply agreement — it’s a clear commitment to a lower-carbon future for air travel. With emissions reductions comparable to removing tens of thousands of transatlantic flights’ worth of carbon, the deal not only boosts BA’s sustainability credentials but also reinforces the role of SAF as a cornerstone in aviation’s decarbonization roadmap.

Now British Airways joins EcoCeres to secure a reliable supply of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, reinforcing its commitment to greener travel and its goal of cutting emissions across global operations. The partnership supports BA’s target to use 10% SAF by 2030 and advances its net-zero ambitions.

This initiative supports compliance with the UN International Civil Aviation Organisation’s emission reduction program, which becomes mandatory in 2027.

Under the new regulations, airlines operating international flights involving Turkey must use enough SAF to achieve the 5% emissions reduction target. Jet fuel suppliers in Turkey will also be required to source SAF to meet this goal, including domestic oil refiners like Tupras.

The authority will set and publish minimum emission reduction targets annually before the end of the third quarter. It will enforce penalties on airlines and fuel suppliers that fail to comply.

Additionally, airlines must load 90% of their required SAF for international flights within Turkey.

According to the International Energy Agency, aviation accounts for 2.5% of global energy-related CO2 emissions.

Tupras, Turkey’s largest oil refiner, plans to produce 20,000 metric tons of SAF at a major plant by 2026 and aims to increase production to 400,000 tons by constructing a new unit at its Izmir refinery, pending final investment approval.

RELATED: From India, Soft Power Punching Harder With Opportunity and Skill India, Japan, and the New Tariff Reality Finding Opportunities for Cooperation in India's Challenging Neighborhood","In a move to expedite decarbonization efforts while reducing clean energy costs in India, Japan and India are finalizing a Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM). This bilateral framework will enable both nations to exchange emission reduction credits, supporting Japan in fulfilling its climate commitments.

Japan's goal of achieving net-zero by 2050 and India's 45% emissions reduction target by 2030 highlight the natural partnership between the two countries in decarbonization and economic growth. Japanese companies are increasingly interested in entering the Indian market as a relocation destination for production bases or as an investment opportunity. Therefore, this article explores the potential of partnerships in the carbon market sector.

What is the Joint Credit Mechanism?

Under the JCM, Japanese companies will invest in and deploy advanced carbon reduction technologies in India. In return, Japan will receive carbon credits that can offset its emissions or be traded within its national carbon market. The initiative falls under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, which ensures internationally recognized and verifiable emissions reductions.

Once finalized, carbon credits will be officially registered and tracked. Joint committees will be formed to oversee project implementation and to verify credit issuance through the formulation of a detailed report.

Consequently, this mechanism will assist both countries in meeting their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris framework. A wide range of sectors, including solar thermal energy, green hydrogen, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), are expected to benefit from JCM investments.

A Proven Model for International Cooperation

Originally initiated by Japan, the JCM facilitates the transfer of technical expertise and climate-friendly technologies from developed to developing countries. Developed nations benefit by outsourcing their emissions reductions, often at a lower cost. Meanwhile, this supports sustainable development in host countries. It helps mobilize international finance, alleviating the cost burden for the recipient country.

Currently, Japan has established similar agreements with 11 other countries, including Indonesia, Kenya, and Vietnam.

India and Japan had been discussing a JCM partnership since 2014. In 2023, a $600 million fund was jointly launched by India's quasi-sovereign wealth fund, the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) to invest in sustainable projects. JBIC contributed 51% of that total, while the remainder came from India.

The fund aimed to invest in sustainable projects in areas such as e-mobility, renewable energy, and waste management. Other key initiatives, such as the Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT) scheme, have facilitated a long-standing India-Japan collaboration in energy efficiency. This partnership has reduced 10 million tons of CO2 emissions, saved 25 million tons of oil equivalent energy, and generated $10 billion in investments.

What are the Benefits?

For a country like India, which is vulnerable to climate change, adopting clean technologies is both essential and urgent. Achieving low or zero carbon emissions necessitates access to these technologies. However, such technologies often come with high upfront costs. This may exceed what the governments of developing countries can currently fund. They are typically expensive or not widely available.

For example, generating electricity from coal is cheaper than using green hydrogen or solar thermal power, despite the environmental cost. In this context, Japan's role becomes critical. It helps to equalize the cost of clean energy with conventional, polluting sources by subsidizing these technologies. Today, problems such as a severed supply chain, amid an unstable global situation, have aligned both countries' efforts and broader climate ambitions to build effective carbon markets.

A Strategic and Economic Game-Changer

Coal continues to dominate India's power mix due to its lower capital costs. However, with Japanese subsidies, alternatives such as energy storage systems and solar thermal plants could become economically viable, thereby accelerating India's energy transition. It has the potential to transform India's energy sector by improving the competitiveness and affordability of renewable energy technologies.

Beyond emissions cuts and costs, the JCM has the potential to generate jobs in both nations by fostering investments in low-carbon technologies. Furthermore, it promises to drive economic growth by creating skilled jobs. India can strategically channel these funds into underdeveloped clean energy sectors, leveraging Japanese expertise to expedite its transition to a low-carbon economy. This aligns with India's dual goals of sustainable development and economic expansion. Meanwhile, Japanese companies gain access to a rapidly growing market for clean technologies.

The initiative is likely to strengthen India-Japan strategic ties, complementing their collaboration in infrastructure, defense, and economic security. It also counterbalances China's growing regional influence, having a ripple effect on different domains of collaboration. However, the ultimate goal is for India to adopt and scale these technologies independently, making JCM a high-stakes and high-impact partnership.

India Fields Itself

India is poised to introduce its long-awaited carbon market by 2026. The market for the sale and purchase of carbon credits does not currently exist in our country. Under this program, those who use fossil fuels or emit carbon would have to buy carbon credits, while those who use power from non-fossil sources would receive carbon credits that they can sell in the market.

The introduction of carbon credits should incentivize manufacturers to adopt green energy solutions, reducing carbon emissions and enhancing compliance with global regulations. India's strong potential in green hydrogen, energy efficiency, waste management, and biogas reaffirms Japan's commitment to supporting these initiatives.

Major Roadblocks

There have been significant roadblocks to warming India-Japan relations in the climate domain. Negotiations with India have been ongoing since 2014, highlighting the complexity of such high-stakes climate agreements. Challenges also remain in ensuring that emissions reductions are not double-counted. This will be crucial to upholding the mechanism's credibility and preventing any compromise of its integrity.

Additionally, there is a concern that Japan might use the JCM to delay more decisive domestic climate actions. Critics argue that developed countries should prioritize cutting emissions at home first, as it feeds into domestic political debate on climate. However, supporters of the mechanism contend that international cooperation through frameworks like the JCM facilitates faster and more cost-effective global progress toward climate goals.

Long-term sustainability is another critical issue. India must ultimately develop the capability to adopt and scale these technologies independently. This will require not only funding but also knowledge transfer, training, and the development of infrastructure.

Without such capacity-building, the JCM risks becoming a short-term fix rather than a foundation for lasting transformation. India must cultivate the ability to sustain and expand these technologies over time.

Toward a Model Partnership

India is the world's third-largest GHG emitter, primarily due to its coal and industrial activities. Similar JCM partnerships, such as those in Vietnam, have already achieved measurable CO2 reductions in key sectors. A similar trajectory can be expected for India by targeting high-emission areas with solutions like sustainable aviation fuel and green hydrogen. Although the exact emissions reduction targets under the India-Japan JCM have yet to be disclosed, the potential is significant.

The Japan-India JCM could serve as a global blueprint for climate cooperation if implemented effectively. It has the potential to reduce the cost of climate action, accelerate technology transfer, and strengthen diplomatic ties. This should help both nations move closer to their climate goals.

Technological options include the potential of green ammonia, hydrogen, and solar energy in industrial transformation. Carbon dioxide removal technologies are also highlighted as important. There is a need for technology transfer, financing, and strategic partnerships to boost sustainability efforts.

Both nations are committed to climate action. Through innovative technologies and strong policy frameworks, they can create mutually beneficial pathways toward decarbonization. Japan's approach to carbon markets aligns well with India's sustainability goals. Its commitment to strengthening investment ties with India through the JCM framework, which promotes energy security and a low-carbon future, is well-timed.

By aligning sustainability objectives with strategic interests, this partnership can show how developed and developing countries can collaborate meaningfully to address one of the most significant challenges of our time.

“Global airlines are increasingly looking to Latin America and the Caribbean to redirect operations and mitigate geopolitical risks,” says Peter Cerdá, IATA’s Regional Vice President for the Americas.
Increasing connectivity Airlines have certainly delivered on connectivity when the opportunity and framework are there.
In Latin America and the Caribbean, that drops to $3.40—less than half.
“With collaboration, investment, and a shared vision, we can continue transforming how people and goods move across the region,” Cerdá summarizes.","Aviation in Latin America and the Caribbean links more than 670 million people across 33 countries. In 2024, some 481 million passengers took to the skies, marking a 7.8% increase from the previous year.

Conflict and turbulent geopolitics in other parts of the world are feeding into this growth. “Global airlines are increasingly looking to Latin America and the Caribbean to redirect operations and mitigate geopolitical risks,” says Peter Cerdá, IATA’s Regional Vice President for the Americas. “For example, we have seen Canadian and European carriers capitalize on shifting demand away from the United States by launching new routes to the Caribbean, Mexico, and South America, highlighting how our region is becoming a strategic alternative for global carriers.”

Cerdá adds that this should also serve as a reminder for the many Ministers of Tourism who attended WOCA that airlines are looking for partnerships and favorable conditions to start service. In 2024, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council, the tourism sector contributed $714 billion to the GDP of Latin America and the Caribbean and supported over 28 million jobs.

Increasing connectivity

Airlines have certainly delivered on connectivity when the opportunity and framework are there. In Guatemala, international traffic increased 45% between 2019 and 2024 thanks to an ambitious reform agenda consisting of a new legislation, airport modernization, and a commitment to resolving tax and infrastructure issues.

In Guyana, the administration has reaffirmed its commitment to making aviation a pillar of national development. KLM has opened up a route into Europe and major US carriers have started connecting the country to their major hubs.

Argentina, meanwhile, has prioritized liberalization and competition—signing or renegotiating 14 bilateral air service agreements, opening the ground handling market, and reducing regulatory barriers. By March 2025, this had led to a 26% year-over-year increase in international passenger demand. Aerolineas Argentinas is profitable for the first time in many years.

Overcoming vulnerabilities

“But the truth is that it is still difficult for carriers in the region to make money,” stresses Cerdá. “Globally, in 2025 airlines are expected to achieve a profit of $36 billion or about $7.20 per passenger. In Latin America and the Caribbean, that drops to $3.40—less than half. This razor-thin margin highlights how vulnerable this region is to shocks—from excessive taxation to regulatory burdens and infrastructure constraints.”

Taxes and fees can make up to 40% of the ticket cost in certain countries and these fees are dampening demand and negatively affecting the region. The proposed 26.5% VAT on air tickets in Brazil highlights this onerous tax burden. If the law goes into effect, IATA estimates it could lead to a 30% reduction in demand. So, while the rest of the region increasingly benefits from aviation connectivity, the Brazilian market would contract.

The VAT increase would raise the average cost of flying from $130 to $160 for domestic traffic, and from $740 to $935 for international traffic. This comes on top of the highest litigation rates in the world and import-priced jet fuel, despite local production.

But even in this tough cost environment, since 2015 international airfares in Brazil have dropped 15.3%, and domestic fares 14.9%, showcasing airlines’ resilience and the value they provide.

“There is a small window of opportunity to reduce the VAT and educate the authorities on international best practice,” says Cerdá. “We will explain what a loss of connectivity could mean for the country.”

Regulation and infrastructure

More generally, the regulatory environment needs to be simplified. A particular concern is the rise in consumer protection laws modeled on EU261, even though this clearly isn’t solving the delays seen in Europe.

In Peru, there is a bill aimed at removing airlines’ ability to charge for specific seat assignments and carry-on luggage, which Cerdá likens to “telling a restaurant it can’t charge for drinks or appetizers—only the main course.”

In Colombia, proposed legislation on overbooking and fare caps would drive-up costs and reduce flexibility and similar ideas are under consideration in Brazil, Chile and Mexico.

In terms of infrastructure, there has been a lot of development in the region. Major hubs like Bogotá, Buenos Aires, Lima, Mexico City, Panama City, Santiago and São Paulo have new or expanded facilities. But many of these facilities are already saturated.

“We need a long-term vision—not just for major hubs, but also for secondary and tertiary cities,” Cerdá notes.

In Colombia, a comprehensive airspace/airport optimization study for Eldorado airport in Bogotá was developed collaboratively by IATA, the industry, and the government over two years ago. Although this initiative is now being looked at again, to date only a handful of its recommendations have been implemented. Cerdá says this is typical of the missed opportunities to unlock efficiency, reduce delays, and enhance capacity.

Sustainability

As with other regions, sustainability looms over all developments in the region. When looked at on paper, the region could be a significant producer of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) because of its natural environment. Although there is no production at present, several countries—specifically Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico—are putting the right framework in place. Securing the investment and kickstarting production will take time, however.

“There is a long road ahead but there is still a lot of countries can do before the SAF supply picks up,” says Cerdá. “There are many small gains that will add up from better infrastructure to air traffic control to improved taxiing at certain airports. There is low hanging fruit still out there.”

Regional integration

Latin America and the Caribbean is expected to grow 3.2% year-on-year until 2044. The region is becoming more attractive and though challenges remain, the opportunities are taking to gain precedence. China Eastern recently announced a new flight connecting Shanghai and Buenos Aires via Auckland, for example.

“With collaboration, investment, and a shared vision, we can continue transforming how people and goods move across the region,” Cerdá summarizes. “There is a rising middle class, increased tourism, and stronger regional integration. We have the chance to build a region that is more connected, more competitive, and more inclusive than ever before.

“And that would mean more jobs, more trade, and more opportunities for millions of people.”

SAF precursors must meet criteria derived from conventional fuels (e.g. Jet A), including complete oxygen removal to prevent jet engine corrosion and a higher heating value (HHV) close to Jet A. Currently, no HTL-derived biocrude meets these. This study, with contributions from researchers at the Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation (CABBI), explored using zeolite-supported molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) nanocatalysts to upgrade wet waste-derived biocrudes into SAF precursors that meet all essential criteria for the first time.

Mo2C nanocatalysts were generated in gas phase and dispersed onto zeolite, tested for their ability to remove oxygen from biocrudes, then used to upgrade wet waste-derived biocrude to SAF via HTL. The upgraded biocrudes were characterized against Federal Aviation Administration specifications.

Our data showed complete oxygen removal from the biocrude and a high heating value of 46.5 MJ/kg, comparable to Jet A. Prescreening tests showed the average carbon number of the upgraded biocrude’s distilled SAF fraction was 10.6, close to 11.4 for average conventional jet fuel, and it satisfied all key SAF prescreening standard specifications, including surface tension, density, viscosity, flash point, and freezing point. The metal carbide nanocatalysts were reusable in upgrading tests multiple times and retained their deoxygenation activity.

This work demonstrates for the first time the feasibility of catalytically upgrading wet waste-derived biocrudes into SAF precursors using zeolite-supported Mo2C nanocatalyst.

The Senate passed its version of the bill in the early hours of Tuesday morning.

But some lawmakers have expressed concern with aspects of the package related to building a new Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC). The bill includes $1.9 billion to build the ARTCC, but one provision of that budget item states that at least three current ARTCCs must be “divested and integrated” into the new facility. Additionally, $100 million is allocated to establish the ARTCC Realignment and Consolidation Effort, where at least 10 ARTCCs would be “closed or consolidated to facilitate recapitalization of ARTCC facilities” operated by the FAA.

This consolidation effort is one of the major aviation amendments from the original House bill, one that could give many state representatives pause. Potential closures would disrupt jobs across a number of districts. Representatives in these districts might be less apt to vote to pass the bill knowing constituents’ jobs are about to be slashed. Currently, 22 ARTCCs are in operation across the country. Which centers are on the chopping block remains unclear.

The sprawling domestic legislation allocates the $12.5 billion for technological and infrastructural upgrades to the nation’s air traffic control system. First passed by the House of Representatives, the bill now returns to the lower chamber where members will vote on the changes made by the Senate before sending it to the president’s desk for signature. Republicans in the house, holding a razor-thin majority, are hoping for a swift passage.

Included in the Senate-passed package is $7.75 billion to telecommunications infrastructure and radar system upgrades, $1 billion for bolstering terminal radar approach control (TRACON) facilities, and $500 million for runway safety and surveillance technologies, among other initiatives. Funding will be provided fully upfront and prioritization of which projects will take precedence will be left to the discretion of the FAA. The bill also reduces the tax credit for using Sustainable Aviation fuel (SAF) from $1.75 per gallon to $1.

As part of the up-front funding, the FAA is required to report specific expenditures to Congress 180 days after the bill’s final passage and every 90 days after that.

On X.com, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy implored Congress to send the bill to the president’s desk. In the post he defended the bill, saying that if not passed, the department will “do nothing” on the air traffic control front.

His support is a backtrack of previous comments where he expressed it would require additional funding in order to implement the needed overhauls to air traffic control.

Duffy said at a press conference in May when asked about the bill, “I’m having conversations with [Congress] at a private level about what I think it could be. The $12.5 billion that we have in the House bill; it’s going to be more than that.”

Aviation industry advocates such as the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) have lauded the legislation for the steps taken to revitalize air traffic control. “We thank the Senate for recognizing with this initial funding that a safe and efficient national airspace requires a robust, resilient ATC system that bolsters our nation’s global aviation leadership,” NBAA president and CEO Ed Bolen said in a statement.",https://avweb.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/25-7-3-Congress.jpg,N,,2025-07-02 19:06:40.589743

On Tuesday, the U.S. Senate passed their version of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” by a vote of 51 to 50, with Vice President J.D. Vance breaking the tie, sending it back to the House for final passage before becoming law. The vote was the culmination of an—at times—tumultuous week for Senate GOP leaders who had to keep a procedural vote on the legislation open for three hours on Saturday night to secure the votes necessary to move forward.

The Senate’s version made several changes to the House bill passed on May 22. Most of the changes came after the Senate Parliamentarian ruled some provisions of the bill were in violation of the so-called “Byrd Rule” in the Senate. That rule requires any legislation considered under the reconciliation procedures to be primarily budgetary and not just a policy change that doesn’t impact the budget or only impacts it secondarily. This required changes to, or jettisoning entirely, quite a few of the House’s spending cut provisions.

While the Senate did make some changes to the House-passed tax title, NACS’ main priorities remained in the bill. The Senate did eliminate the House-passed increase in the 199(A) deduction for pass-through entities, but it preserved NACS’ top priority of making the existing deduction permanent.

The Senate bill also maintained the House language making increases in the Estate Tax and Section 179 expensing thresholds permanent. It also improves the House bill by not only extending 100% Bonus Depreciation and the return to EBITDA for calculating income for the purposes of the business interest deductions, but making those changes permanent as well.

Below is a list of tax features the Senate Reconciliation Bill has updated:

Federal Corporate Tax Rate (C-corps): Remains flat 21%, no rate cut in Senate text

Graduated Rates: The flat rate stays at 21%

Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax: Eliminated under TCJA, no new CAMT included in bill

Pass-Through Income (QBI, sec 199A): Makes permanent at 20% (20% deduction legacy was previously set to expire in 2025)

Bonus Depreciation: Permanently extended, was previously 100% through 2025 under TCJA

R&D Expensing (Sec 174): Permanent suspension of capitalization, retroactive

Interest Limitation: Switches to EBITDA cap permanently

Section 179 Expensing: Expanded to $2.5M/$4M limit, was previously $1.16M limit

Estate Tax: Permanently sets exemption at $15M per person, indexed annually

One of the most contentious negotiations among GOP Senators was the same as on the House side—how to deal with the State and Local Tax (SALT) Deduction. Notable for many convenience retailers, the Senate’s compromise eliminates the House language that invalidated SALT deduction work arounds for businesses that many states had passed since 2018.

On the energy side, the Senate bill also levels the playing field between sustainable aviation fuel and other biofuels. This provision will help level the playing field for biofuel production instead of arbitrarily creating winners and losers among the trucking, railway and aviation industries.

Noting the above benefits to our industry, NACS sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) expressing our industry’s support and urging Senators to support final passage of the Reconciliation package.

Due to the changes the Senate made, the bill must now be passed again in the House of Representatives before it can be sent to President Donald Trump. It remains to be seen if the changes made will be acceptable to the House GOP, particularly to budget hard liners in the caucus. If the House makes any further changes, it will have to be sent back to the Senate for another round of voting. Should that occur, the overall viability of the legislation would be in even greater jeopardy. The goal of republican leadership remains to have this package on the President’s desk by July 4, meaning the House will have to be called back from their district work period this week to take the needed votes.",https://www.convenience.org/getattachment/Media/Daily/2025/July/2/2-Senate-Passes-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill_GR/Story-2.png,N,,2025-07-02 18:07:56.781590

Vice President J.D. Vance cast the tiebreaking vote, securing the bill’s return to the House for a final vote.

The newest version of the bill includes a rollback of certain clean energy tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act. Under the Senate-passed version, the bill accelerates the sunset of some existing incentives, including the consumer tax credit for electric vehicles and used EV credit, which will expire on September 30, 2025.

The Senate’s version of the bill also shortens the lifespan of the 45V hydrogen production tax credit. Originally enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the 45V credit was designed to provide up to $3 per kilogram of low-emission hydrogen during a 10-year period. Under the Senate-passed legislation, the credit would be phased out entirely for projects not under construction by the end of 2027. Hydrogen facilities that begin construction before the bill’s enactment and are operational by December 31, 2027, would remain eligible for the credit. The change could also affect the future of the Department of Energy’s Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs initiative, which is reliant on the 45V credit to attract private capital and ensure commercial feasibility.

The Senate version of the bill also includes modifications to biofuel and renewable diesel tax credits. It extends the clean fuel production credit — Section 45Z — through 2031, but applies a 20% reduced credit value for biofuels manufactured from feedstocks sourced outside the U.S. The legislation also revives and increases the small agri-biodiesel producer credit, boosting it from $0.10 to $0.20 per gallon and extending eligibility through December 31, 2026, and reinstates credit transferability.

For sustainable aviation fuel, the Senate version rolls back the enhanced credit rate for fuel sold after 2025. However, the basic SAF credit remains available through fuel sold in 2029 as part of Section 45Z adjustments.

The House is expected to take up the bill later this week. If successful, President Trump is expected to sign the bill into law on or before July 4.",https://www.act-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CSPAN-Senate-Vote.jpg,N,,2025-07-02 19:06:44.456543

Frontier, with carbon dioxide emissions of 54.4 grams per available seat kilometer in 2024, was beat out only by Hungarian discount carrier Wizz Air, which emitted 53.9 grams of CO2 per seat kilometer last year, according to the Cirium analysis.

As a point of comparison, lifecycle emissions of a simple cup of black coffee are 21 grams of carbon, according to CarbonClick, with emissions sometimes ballooning to many times more than that depending upon cultivation techniques, the type of cup used and whether the coffee is consumed with cream or other additives.

Among the world's 10 largest airlines, as measured by total seat miles offered, Ryanair was the top emissions performer, emitting 63 grams of CO2 per available seat kilometer. The four U.S. carriers among the top 10 largest airlines ranked second through fifth respectively, with Southwest leading the way, followed by Delta, American and United.

Southwest was the clear efficiency winner among those U.S. behemoths, with emissions of 68.9 grams per available seat kilometer. The other three were bunched closely together, emitting between 74.4 and 75.4 grams of CO2 per seat kilometer.

How the ranking is calculated

Cirium joins several entities that have developed methodologies for measuring aviation and airline carbon emissions, including Google, IATA, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the U.K.'s environmental department DEFRA and Cirium's competitor, OAG. But Cirium says its platform, called Emerald Sky, is the first to use real-time flight tracking data for its calculations instead of relying on projected or standard routes or forecasted route averages.

To achieve its emissions estimates, the platform also considers actual air time and atmospheric conditions of a flight; aircraft and engine types; aircraft age; seating configurations; passenger loads; cargo loads; and taxi times.

An airline's usage of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is not yet considered in the Emerald Sky formula because SAF accounts for only a tiny fraction of total jet fuel. Cirium chief strategy officer Kevin O'Toole said the company will include SAF in the algorithm once its accounts for 1% of global fuel consumption, which is about double its current contribution.

Cirim said the methodology had been independently reviewed and validated by PricewaterhouseCoopers and by the Rocky Mountain Institute, a Boulder, Colo.-based environmental nonprofit.

Why low-cost carriers are more CO2-efficient

Overall, the Cirium Flight Emissions Review showed that dense seat configurations and modern fleets are airlines' primary levers for efficiency.

All the 10 most efficient carriers have a low-cost model. Frontier achieved its second place ranking largely through its combination of densely configured cabins and a fleet that averages just four-and-a-half years of age.

The other U.S. airline in the top 10 is low-cost carrier Spirit, with a fleet-age average of 6.3 years of age.

As demand surges in the Americas and Europe while regional supply chains buckle under refinery outages and geopolitical tensions, Northeast Asian exporters—led by South Korea—are stepping into the breach. A 26% projected leap in South Korea's July jet fuel exports, fueled by arbitrage opportunities and widening price differentials, underscores a structural shift in energy trade dynamics. Yet, this boom comes with risks: rising freight costs, Middle Eastern competition, and regulatory headwinds loom large. For investors, the question is clear: how to position for this volatile yet transformative market?

The Arbitrage Play: Price Gaps and Refinery Flexibility

South Korea's jet fuel exports to the U.S. hit a four-year high in May 2025, with 4.3 million barrels exported—a 33% year-over-year jump. This surge reflects a stark reality: U.S. refinery shutdowns (e.g., PBF Energy's California fire, Valero's Benicia closure) have created a supply vacuum. Meanwhile, Northeast Asian refiners like SK Innovation and S-Oil are leveraging their idle capacity and proximity to Asian crude markets to exploit price differentials.

Jet fuel in Asia trades at a $10–$15/barrel discount to U.S. prices due to weaker regional demand and oversupply. This gap, combined with freight rates hovering near 2024 lows (despite rising competition), makes arbitrage feasible—for now.

Risks on the Horizon: Freight, Middle Eastern Muscle, and Sustainability

The arithmetic of arbitrage is fragile. Freight costs, though currently manageable, could spike if trans-Pacific demand for tankers surges. Middle Eastern producers—such as Saudi Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company—also eye the U.S. and European markets, armed with lower-cost crude and long-haul shipping expertise.

Moreover, sustainability mandates loom. South Korea's 2027 SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) blending rule requires refiners to mix 1% SAF into jet fuel—a hurdle for firms without green infrastructure. Companies like SK, which has partnered with Cathay Pacific on SAF exports, may gain an edge, while laggards face compliance costs.

Investment Strategies: Short-Term Gains, Long-Term Bets

Short-Term: Refiners with Flexibility

SK Innovation (SK 034730.KS) and S-Oil (010950.KS) are prime picks. Their modern refineries can pivot quickly between jet fuel, gasoline, and petrochemicals, capitalizing on price swings. Both have export contracts with U.S. buyers and are expanding SAF capacity.

Logistics Plays: Invest in firms like Hanjin Logistics (086650.KS) or COSCO Shipping (1999.HK), which handle trans-Pacific shipments. Their earnings correlate strongly with tanker utilization rates.

Long-Term: Structural Winners in SAF and Supply Chains

SAF Leaders: Companies like SK E&S (004090.KS), which is building a $1.2 billion SAF plant in South Korea, will benefit as mandates tighten.

Regional Infrastructure: Ports like Busan and Singapore's PSA International (0509.SI) are critical nodes in Northeast Asia's export network. Their valuations may rise if transoceanic trade volumes normalize post-arbitrage frenzy.

Conclusion: Navigating the Turbulence

The Northeast Asian jet fuel boom is a classic case of supply chain arbitrage—a short-lived opportunity to profit from regional imbalances. Investors must balance the upside of current price gaps with the risks of rising costs and Middle Eastern competition. For those willing to be nimble, refiners and logistics firms offer asymmetric returns. But as sustainability rules bite and global supply chains stabilize, only those with green credentials and scale will dominate the next phase of this market.

Stay agile, and keep an eye on those freight rates.

If completed before its South Dakota counterpart, the Richardton facility would be the nation’s first fully integrated sustainable aviation fuel plant.
“We envision making sustainable aviation fuel there.
He sees the potential for 100% sustainable fuel use in the future, though not immediately.","RICHARDTON, N.D. — North Dakota Congresswoman Julie Fedorchak visited the Red Trail Energy bioethanol production plant and carbon sequestration facility in Richardton on Monday, June 30.

Fedorchak’s visit came several months after Gevo Inc., a Colorado-based sustainable energy company, purchased the plant for about $210 million and announced plans to add an on-site facility to convert bioethanol into sustainable aviation fuel.

Gevo first announced the acquisition in September 2024. Red Trail’s shareholders approved the sale in December, and the deal closed in early February 2025.

Fedorchak, co-chair of the Congressional Biofuels Caucus, met with Gevo officials to discuss biofuels production, construction timelines, carbon sequestration and the integration of agriculture with energy production.

In an interview with The Dickinson Press, Fedorchak voiced her support for the project.

“North Dakota is an agricultural state, farming is the backbone of our economy,” she said. “Our land is our greatest resource so we always need to be looking at ways to do new and higher value things with our crops, and biofuels are one of our biggest opportunities. We need more energy in our country and in our world. There's a high demand for lower carbon fuels. Biofuels can potentially need that demand.”

Founded in 2005, Gevo Inc. develops low-carbon, sustainable alternatives to petroleum-based fuels. The company began planning a sustainable aviation fuel plant in Lake Preston, South Dakota, to use the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline for carbon capture .

When Summit failed to secure state permits, Gevo sought an alternative site.

“We decided to take some of our money and go kind of jump start our production capability by finding a site that would really fit in with our business strategy,” said Chris Ryan, Gevo’s president and COO.

Ryan cited the existing ethanol plant, ties to local agriculture, carbon sequestration capabilities and the company’s growth strategy as reasons for selecting Richardton.

If completed before its South Dakota counterpart, the Richardton facility would be the nation’s first fully integrated sustainable aviation fuel plant.

The Richardton site currently produces 65 million gallons of corn-based bioethanol annually from 23 million bushels of corn. It also sells co-products like distillers grains, syrup for animal feed and corn oil, which has both culinary and industrial uses.

The site also hosts the first U.S. carbon capture and storage project permitted under state primacy.

“The plant is very efficient. It’s a great team up there, running it. We don’t plan on really changing that,” Ryan said.

Gevo’s new facility would convert ethanol into jet fuel on-site.

“We envision making sustainable aviation fuel there. That’s a key focus for us,” Ryan said. “To do that, we would add a facility that would take the bioethanol and convert it to jet fuel.”

The new plant is expected to create 50 full-time jobs and many more during construction.

Stark County Commission Chairman Neal Messer, a Richardton native and small grains farmer, said the project adds value to local commodities.

“I view it as value added to our farm commodities and anytime you can do that it’s a good thing,” Messer said.

He also disclosed receiving payments for carbon stored under his property.

Messer expressed confidence in the agricultural impact, saying the facility would help farmers diversify and grow.

“It allows smaller communities like my hometown of Richardton to thrive,” he said.

Messer said he wasn’t overly concerned about the impact the new facility would have on the local agricultural community, instead stating his belief it would enable local farmers to grow and diversify their farm commodities.

He ended his interview by saying he believed the project would be a net positive for Richardton.

“It allows smaller communities like my hometown of Richardton to thrive,” Messer said.

In 2021, the International Air Transport Association — which represents about 82% of global air traffic — pledged to be carbon-neutral by 2050. The plan relies on sustainable aviation fuels for 65% of its reductions and carbon capture for 19%.

“The aviation industry is under pressure to do something about their carbon emissions,” Ryan said. “So over the years they have decided to step up and participate in buying lower carbon options.”

The fuel produced at Richardton will be sold to airlines, typically mixed with petroleum jet fuel at 10–50%, depending on regulations.

“You’re basically extending the life of the petroleum jet fuel not only by adding gallons, but you’re also decreasing the carbon score for the entire gallon,” Ryan said.

He sees the potential for 100% sustainable fuel use in the future, though not immediately.

Not all are convinced of the benefits. The World Resources Institute argues sustainable aviation fuels may not reduce net carbon emissions, citing increased demand for cropland and loss of carbon-storing grasslands — a concern in sparsely forested states like North Dakota.

Ryan noted the landscape wouldn’t change significantly due to the site’s existing ethanol plant and that any shifts would have occurred when it opened in the 2000s.

Still, Gevo has discussed expanding ethanol production, potentially increasing corn demand.

“A lot of our supplier farmers attended a launch where we talked to them and asked, ‘Do you have the ability to grow more corn,’ and they said absolutely yes,” Ryan said.

The WRI also criticized the conversion rate — 1.7 gallons of ethanol to make 1 gallon of jet fuel — as inefficient.

Ryan countered that the energy content remains consistent or higher because the conversion process removes water, concentrating hydrocarbons.

Carbon sequestration, while operational, carries risks. The Environmental Law Institute warns of potential leakage into soil or groundwater.

Gevo officials said the risk is mitigated by the site’s placement over the Broom Creek Formation, which is capped by two impermeable rock layers.

Ryan said the facility is in the engineering phase, with construction potentially beginning in 12 to 18 months. Completion is projected for late 2028 or 2029.

Airlines operating in Europe are facing mounting challenges stemming from compliance fees imposed by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) producers and suppliers.

While these fees are designed to support regulatory and sustainability goals, they are adding significant financial, operational, and strategic burdens to an industry already navigating tight margins and a highly competitive landscape.

“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to 2mn tonnes in 2025, which is just 0.7% of aviation’s total fuel needs. And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4bn globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate,” said IATA’s Director General Willie Walsh.

The problem with mandates: Most SAF is now heading towards Europe, where the European Union and United Kingdom mandates kicked in on January 1.

“Unacceptably, the cost of SAF to airlines has now doubled in Europe because of compliance fees that SAF producers or suppliers are charging,” IATA says.

For the expected 1mn tonnes of SAF that will be purchased to meet the European mandates in 2025, the expected cost at current market prices is $1.2bn.

Compliance fees are estimated to add an additional $1.7bn on top of market prices—an amount that could have abated an additional 3.5mn tonnes of carbon emissions.

Instead of promoting the use of SAF, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel.

“This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonisation.

“Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7tn should not be the aim or the result of decarbonisation policies. Europe needs to realise that its approach is not working and find another way,” Walsh said on the sidelines of IATA’s annual general meeting in New Delhi last month.

Global SAF market: To support the development of a global SAF market, IATA has worked on two initiatives:

A SAF registry managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonisation Organisation (CADO) that brings a transparent and standardised system for tracking SAF purchases, usage and associated emissions reductions in compliance with international regulations such as Carbon Offsetting Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.

The SAF Matchmaker that will facilitate SAF procurement by matching airline requests for SAF with supply offers.

IATA urges governments to focus on three areas:

Creating more effective policies. Eliminating the disadvantage that renewable energy producers face compared with big oil is necessary to scale renewable energy production in general and SAF production in particular. This includes redirecting a portion of the $1tn in subsidies that governments globally grant for fossil fuel.

Develop a comprehensive approach to energy policy that includes SAF. Firstly, advancing SAF production requires an increase in renewable energy production from which SAF is derived.

Secondly, it also requires policies to ensure SAF is allocated an appropriate portion of renewable energy production. A holistic approach should support joint use of infrastructure, co-production and other measures that will benefit the energy transition for aviation and for all other economic sectors.

Ensure the success of CORSIA as the sole market-based mechanism to address international aviation’s CO2 emissions. IATA urges governments to make Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) available to airlines. To date Guyana is the only state to have made their carbon credits available for airlines to purchase and claim against their CORSIA obligations.

Focus on India: India, one of the emerging economies on the world stage today, is the third-largest oil user after the US and China. India launched the Global Biofuels Alliance to position biofuels as a key to energy transition and economic growth.

This includes a target for 2% SAF blending for international flights by 2028 with enabling policies such as guaranteed pricing, capital support for new projects, and technical standards. IATA will be working with the Indian Sugar & Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) and Praj Industries, to provide guidance on global best practices for life cycle assessment of the use of feedstocks in the country.

As the third-largest global civil aviation market, India can strengthen its leadership in biofuels with the accelerated adoption of SAF through progressive policies.

IATA SAF Matchmaker platform: Recently, IATA announced the release of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Matchmaker platform, to facilitate SAF procurement between airlines and SAF producers by matching requests for SAF supply with offers.

When there is a match, airlines and suppliers can connect and take their negotiation offline to agree on specific terms including price and payment terms.

The growing use of SAF is essential to decarbonising aviation. However, excessive compliance fees in Europe risk undermining adoption by inflating costs and reducing efficiency.

Airlines must balance regulatory obligations with economic realities—something only achievable through smarter, more supportive policy frameworks.

On 20 March, a fire at the North Hyde 275kV substation, which feeds most of Heathrow, resulted in the airport’s closure.
It found that an elevated moisture reading in the bushing had been detected in oil samples taken by the National Grid in July 2018.
Following the report's findings, Ofgem has now launched an investigation into National Grid.
The report states that “Heathrow airport have a plan to deal with this which includes reconfiguring their internal electrical distribution network to take power from the other two supply points”.","A fire at a Heathrow airport substation, owned by the National Grid, was caused by a problem first detected seven years ago but never fixed, according to a final report by the National Energy System Operator (NESO).

On 20 March, a fire at the North Hyde 275kV substation, which feeds most of Heathrow, resulted in the airport’s closure.

Aviation chaos ensued, with more than 1,300 flights cancelled and hundreds of thousands of passengers affected. More than 70,000 other businesses, homes and services were also affected, including Hillingdon Hospital.

Energy watchdog Ofgem commissioned NESO to conduct an investigation, assessing the reasons the fire started in the first place as well as a broader assessment about the UK’s energy resilience and actions that could be taken to prevent similar incidents in future.

The report found that at 11.21pm on 20 March one of three supergrid transformers (SGT3) at the North Hyde substation and its associated circuit tripped. Shortly after, the other transformers (SGT1 and SGT2) tripped. The cause was a catastrophic failure on one of SGT3’s high-voltage bushings, which caused the transformer to catch fire.

This was most likely caused by moisture entering the bushing, causing an electrical fault.

It found that an elevated moisture reading in the bushing had been detected in oil samples taken by the National Grid in July 2018.

According to the National Grid’s relevant guidance, such readings indicate “an imminent fault and that the bushing should be replaced”.

While this elevated moisture reading was recorded in its online system, “mitigating actions appropriate to its severity were not implemented”, the report found.

In addition, in 2022 a decision was made to defer basic maintenance on SGT3.

Fintan Slye, NESO’s chief executive, told the BBC’s Today programme that while the report “did not set out to apportion blame”, the National Grid was responsible for the maintenance of the equipment and ensuring it was fit for operation.

“So when they identified those moisture levels back in 2018, what should have happened is that the transformer should have been taken out of service for a short period of time and that fault effectively repaired.

“That was missed. The moisture got worse over time and ultimately that’s what caused the fire to happen. The story of our report really is probably one of missed opportunities.”

According to the BBC, National Grid said it had “taken further action since the fire”, including “re-testing the resilience of substations that serve strategic infrastructure”.

Following the report's findings, Ofgem has now launched an investigation into National Grid.

The report also found that because of the way Heathrow’s electricity network is configured, the loss of power from the substation – one of three supply points for the airport – led to a power outage to some of the airport’s critical systems.

The report states that “Heathrow airport have a plan to deal with this which includes reconfiguring their internal electrical distribution network to take power from the other two supply points”.

It also found that “energy network operators are not generally aware whether customers connected to their networks are Critical National Infrastructure”.

The report makes a number of recommendations to reduce the likelihood and impact of a similar event in the future. These include resilience of infrastructure with multiple supply points, maintenance actions, electricity safety, quality and continuity regulations, and incident management protocols.

Slye said: “The power outage and closure of Heathrow airport were hugely disruptive, and our report seeks to improve the way parties plan for and respond to these incidents, building on the underlying resilience of our energy system.

“All parties involved are focused on working together to deliver these important recommendations, and much of this work is already under way with NESO’s full support.”",https://cdn2.eandtmagazine.org/sites/default/files/styles/uncropped_small/public/2025-03/web_london-united-kingdom-15-july-2024_Credit_WildSnap_shutterstock_2506722765_1600x900.jpg?itok=VqERPk13,N,,2025-07-02 18:08:12.026467

This movement aimed to discourage air travel due to its significant environmental impact, particularly its contribution to carbon emissions.
The reversal of the tax, effective July 1, comes as the government seeks to boost the country’s commercial aviation industry.
This move is expected to lower ticket prices, making air travel more affordable and potentially increasing demand, which could boost the competitiveness of airlines.
A majority of Swedes initially supported the air tax, but the environmental impact of the tax has been a subject of debate.","Sweden has reversed its air travel tax policy, which was introduced in 2018 to curb carbon emissions and reduce air travel. The tax, which placed levies on airline tickets based on the distance flown, was part of a broader movement known as ""flight shaming,"" popularized by environmental activists like Greta Thunberg. This movement aimed to discourage air travel due to its significant environmental impact, particularly its contribution to carbon emissions.

The reversal of the tax, effective July 1, comes as the government seeks to boost the country’s commercial aviation industry. The tax had led to a steady decrease in air traffic, particularly to Sweden’s rural airports. A center-right coalition, supported by the far-right Sweden Democrats, presented a 2025 budget proposal that eliminated the tax. This move is expected to lower ticket prices, making air travel more affordable and potentially increasing demand, which could boost the competitiveness of airlines.

Since the tax was implemented, Sweden has seen a significant drop in air traffic. Flights landing in Swedish airports decreased by more than 35%, and Irish airline Ryanair withdrew entirely from Sweden’s domestic market. The tax also contributed to a shift in travel preferences, with train travel passenger numbers jumping to a record high in 2018. A majority of Swedes initially supported the air tax, but the environmental impact of the tax has been a subject of debate.

The reversal of the tax has been met with mixed reactions. Aviation industry leaders are hopeful that the move will stimulate future investments in sustainable technology. Catrin Mattsson, Area Manager for the International Air Transport Association, stated that the previous aviation tax did not support the transition to reducing emissions. With the tax abolished, funds can be redirected towards investments in Sustainable Aviation Fuel, new technologies, and innovations needed for the transition to net-zero CO2 emissions.

However, environmental activists and the Green Party have criticized the decision. They argue that the removal of the aviation tax is counterproductive to Sweden's environmental goals. The Green Party spokesperson expressed disappointment, stating that the government's policies are stupid and counterproductive. The reversal of the tax sends a mixed message about Sweden's commitment to environmental protection and sustainable travel.

Despite the criticism, the Swedish government maintains that sustainability remains a priority. The focus has shifted from discouraging air travel to reducing emissions through other means. The decision to reverse the tax highlights the challenges of balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability. It remains to be seen how this decision will impact Sweden's efforts to reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainable travel in the long run.",,N,,2025-07-02 17:06:49.302096

European bio-bunkers: Prices diverge, abatements firm

London, 1 July (Argus) — European marine biodiesel prices diverged as prices in underlying markets also diverged on Tuesday. In prompt biodiesel markets, outright used cooking oil methyl ester (Ucome) and Advanced Fatty acid methyl ester (Fame) 0 barge prices rose sharply at the close. In fossil markets, the front-month Ice Brent crude and gasoil futures contracts diverged again at 16:30 BST. Delivered VLSFO and MGO prices were mostly close to steady in ARA and GAC, except for VLSFO dob ARA, which fell by $10/t. Marine biodiesel blend prices diverged along the type of biofuel used, as prices for Advanced Fame-based blends picked up while Ucome-based blends eased. Calculated B30 Advanced Fame 0 dob ARA prices, which includes a deduction of the value of Dutch HBE-G renewable fuel tickets, gained $2.38/t to $725.70/t. And calculated B100 Advanced Fame 0 dob ARA prices also increased by $31.29/t to $1,215.18/t — a one-year high. B30 Ucome dob ARA values, on the other hand, eased by $5/t to $820/t, reflecting reported market indications. In the west Mediterranean, Argus assessed B24 dob Algeciras-Gibraltar lower by $10/t on the day at $750/t, also in line with indications. Argus assessments for FuelEU Ucome-MGO abatement and Ucome-VLSFO abatement prices firmed by $8.88/tCO2e to $323.80/tCO2e and by $12.89/tCO2e to $363.70/tCO2e respectively. The increase in Ucome fob ARA prices outpaced higher MGO barge levels, while VLSFO fob northwest Europe values edged lower on the day, lending support to abatement prices. EU ETS prices rebounded to $82.40/t from $80.46/t, but ETS-inclusive premiums held by marine biodiesel blends against their fossil counterparts mostly widened. B30 Ucome dob ARA's ETS-inclusive premium to VLSFO dob ARA rose by $3.73/t to $289.11/t. B30 Advanced Fame 0's ETS-incorporated premium to VLSFO gained $11.11/t to $194.82/t, while B100 Advanced Fame 0's premium to MGO firmed by $28.43/t to $379.75/t, a two-month high. But the ETS-inclusive premium held by B24 dob Algeciras-Gibraltar to VLSFO dob GAC narrowed by about $13/t to $184.89/t.

Philippines’ ethanol imports to increase: USDA

Singapore, 1 July (Argus) — The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) expects the Philippines' fuel ethanol market and imports to grow in 2025, but the country's biodiesel outlook remains unclear. The Philippines' fuel ethanol consumption is expected to increase from 797mn litres in 2024 to 840mn l this year, rising in tandem with the USDA's gasoline consumption growth forecast of 5pc for 2025. The Philippines has a 10pc ethanol blending mandate for road fuel, tying ethanol demand to gasoline consumption. Car purchases rose by 9pc in 2024, the USDA said, while investments in the country's public transportation system have yet to yield results. Reflecting the forecast increase in road fuel consumption, the USDA is predicting that fuel-grade ethanol imports will rise by 10pc to 450mnl in 2025. The relatively steep growth in imported fuel-grade ethanol is the result of limited ethanol feedstock in the country, it said. The Philippines prioritises the use of domestic ethanol in road fuel blending. Fuel suppliers can only import ethanol at times of domestic shortages. Domestic ethanol is produced from sugarcane and molasses, but a recent decline in available sugarcane land has supported sugarcane and molasses prices, pushing up the cost of ethanol. This has resulted in a slowdown in ethanol production growth because of narrower margins. The USDA expects domestic ethanol production to increase at a relatively low rate of 2pc on the year in 2025 because of the feedstock limitations. Sugarcane- and molasses-based ethanol have one of the highest greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction rates among commonly used first-generation or crop-based ethanol feedstocks such as corn. The Philippines' mandate does not stipulate a definite GHG reduction requirement, leading to imports of predominately US corn-based ethanol, which is the most competitively priced in the market. The affordability of US corn-based ethanol encourages a higher blend of ethanol in road fuel. The Philippines approved a voluntary E20 programme in June 2024 and the USDA expects to see higher uptake of this blend in the coming year. Biodiesel The USDA is forecasting that the Philippines' biodiesel production will hit 360mn l in 2025 should the country remain at B3. But it may increase by 50pc from 2024 to 400mn l this year should the B4 mandate be implemented. The progress of the country's B4 programme remains uncertain after members of the national biofuel board (NBB) agreed on 29 May to pass a resolution to suspend the B4 and B5 implementation in 2025 and 2026 respectively. The board cited the relatively high price of seaborne coconut oil as a reason to recalibrate the programme. The Philippines uses domestic coconut oil in its biodiesel production, but coconut oil prices have more than doubled from $1,100/t in 2024 to around $3,000/t in 2025, resulting in a halt to reconsider market economics. The country's energy department has yet to issue an official advisory on the suspension of the B4 programme, leaving the market in limbo. Sustainable aviation fuel The Philippines has yet to publish a roadmap for its SAF mandate but has formed a SAF committee under the NBB. The country's flag carrier Philippine Airlines announced a 1pc SAF target for 2026. Another local airline, Cebu Pacific, has started using SAF and signed an agreement with Finish SAF producer Neste in 2023. The Philippines has yet to produce SAF but is evaluating the situation and considering the feasibility of different pathways.

EcoCeres, British Airways sign SAF supply agreement

Singapore, 1 July (Argus) — Hong Kong-based biofuels producer EcoCeres has signed a multi-year agreement to supply UK's British Airways with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), it announced on 30 June. The SAF is expected to help the airline reduce life cycle carbon emissions by approximately 400,000t, compared with using the same volume of conventional jet fuel, EcoCeres said in its press release. This reduction is also equivalent to the total emissions from flying around 240,000 economy class passengers on return flights between London and New York. EcoCeres declined to share the SAF volumes or time period agreed in the supply deal. British Airways has committed to fuelling 10pc of its flights with SAF by 2030. SAF accounted for 2.7pc of its total fuel use in 2024, and has contributed to a 13pc reduction in carbon intensity since 2019, said the company's director of sustainability Carrie Harris. EcoCeres operates a 350,000 t/yr SAF and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) plant in Jiangsu, China. Its planned SAF and HVO plant in Johor, Malaysia, has a maximum production capacity of 420,000 t/yr and is expected to come on line in the fourth quarter of 2025, market participants said. EcoCeres also manufactured the 500,000 litres of used cooking oil (UCO)-based SAF delivered to Air New Zealand in June 2024 . The SAF was supplied and blended by ExxonMobil.

US Senate bill cuts 45Z extension, boosts crops

New York, 30 June (Argus) — The latest Senate draft of a major US budget bill would extend a biofuels tax break for an additional two years, down from four years in the prior draft, and set far more sweeping limits on foreign feedstocks. The ""45Z"" clean fuel production credit would last until 2029 and be available for only domestically produced fuels produced from North American feedstocks starting next year, according to a draft released over the weekend by Senate leaders that could be voted on as soon as Monday. An earlier Senate draft proposed extending the incentive through 2031 and cutting credit values for foreign feedstocks by just 20pc. The incentive, part of the Inflation Reduction Act, kicked off this year and currently offers a sliding scale of subsidy to US-made alternative fuels through 2027 based on their greenhouse gas emissions. The updated language is a win for farm groups, which have worried that imports of used cooking oil, tallow, and sugarcane ethanol are hurting demand for home-grown crops that can also be turned into biofuels. Refiners that had previously looked abroad for renewable diesel inputs, expanding US production to record levels last year, would have to pay up for scarcer domestic options. A shorter credit extension could frustrate corners of the industry that had emphasized the need for policy certainty — including companies with plans to start producing novel fuels later this decade — although biofuel incentives have a long history of extensions. For instance, the Senate bill would revive an expired tax credit for small biodiesel producers in a major change from earlier drafts. Facilities with capacities of no more than 60mn USG/yr could claim a 20¢/USG subsidy for up to 15mn USG of annual production this year and next year, supplementing tax breaks they can already claim under 45Z. That could keep more biodiesel plants, which have struggled to adapt to policy changes and competition from larger renewable diesel producers, running after a difficult start to the year. Smaller producers also would benefit from the latest Senate draft preserving the ability of companies without enough tax liability to sell tax credits to others. The bill is otherwise similar to earlier versions. It would still bar regulators next year from considering indirect emissions from land use changes, a shift from current law that in effect ups subsidies for fuels made from crops, another top priority for farm groups. If passed, the typical gallon of US dry mill corn ethanol and canola biodiesel would likely qualify for some 45Z subsidy — unlike under current rules — and soybean-based road fuels would earn larger credits next year. Aviation fuels conversely would see slimmer subsidies starting next year, since the bill would eliminate extra credit under current law for jet fuels over road fuels. That would be a major disruption to airlines and to those refiners that have invested in upgrading more of their renewable diesel output to instead produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Trucking groups had argued that the imbalance was diverting feedstocks away from road markets to costlier SAF production — and that treating fuel types equally was one way conservative lawmakers could reduce the credit's price-tag. More changes possible The bill could be changed further Monday as the Senate proceeds with a process in which lawmakers can propose amendments. If the bill passes, it would go back to the House for approval. President Donald Trump has pushed lawmakers to finalize the sprawling package this week, an ambitious timeline given lawmakers still disagree on key issues. Any revised 45Z credit would also need final rules from the US Department of Treasury, which still has questions to answer about eligibility this year. The ultimate profitability of biofuels will depend on interactions between the tax credit and other policies that are also in flux. That includes a federal biofuel blend mandate, which the Trump administration wants to revamp to discourage foreign feedstocks, and newly tougher carbon intensity targets in California's influential low-carbon fuel standard market.

This marks another step to the airline’s fleet renewal and future growth plans. The highlight of the possibility to use 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the aircraft echoes with SAS’s development of more sustainable aviation.

Next Steps: Fleet Renewal, Sustainability and Improved Regional Connectivity

SAS’s record-breaking Embraer order of 55 aircraft is the largest direct order the airline has placed since 1996. The order consists of 45 Embraer E195-E2 aircraft, with purchasing rights of 10 more aircraft. The deal was valued at approximately £3.15 billion, with delivery dates starting in 2027.

Anko van der Werff, CEO and President of SAS, deemed this a ‘defining moment’ for the airline:

“The Embraer E195-E2 is a world-class aircraft, combining outstanding performance with excellent fuel efficiency and comfort. This aircraft is key to enabling future growth and improved connectivity across Scandinavia and beyond. We’ve taken the time to make the right decision — and this major investment reflects our confidence in the future and the strength of the agreement we’ve secured.”

The newly ordered aircraft are part of the strategy to enhance connectivity between the Scandinavian region and Europe. The E2 aircraft, with lower emissions, also allows the airline to abide by sustainability development and promote greener aviation.

Greener Aviation: Increasing SAF Usage

SAF, Sustainable Aviation Fuel, has been gaining increasing attention in recent years with rising environmental concerns. SAF, generally made from renewable or waste sources, could reduce carbon emissions of up to 80% compared to fossil fuels.

The Embraer E2 family has been tested with 100% SAF, whereas as of today, 50% blended SAF is completely achievable in flights. As technology and research progress, the aircraft could fly with 100% SAF, ensuring SAS’s contributions to sustainable development and greener aviation.

With advanced technology and engineering systems, the E195-E2 delivers huge reductions in fuel burn, emissions, and noise compared to previous-generation aircraft.

The Hungarian low-cost carrier emits around 54 grams of CO₂ per seat per kilometer, according to the review, which was verified by PwC and is the first of its kind in the industry.

That efficiency measure is driven by several key factors, starting with Wizz Air’s relatively young fleet. The airline’s planes average around four years old, and many are up to 25% more fuel-efficient than older aircraft.

Seat configuration plays a role too. Low-cost carriers typically cram more seats into each plane, which reduces emissions per passenger.

One often-overlooked detail: how long a plane spends taxiing on the ground. That process can at times account for as much as 20% of a flight’s total emissions.

Cirium's ranking lists airlines that are moving to newer generation aircraft.

Total Greenhouse Gas Emissions Not Accounted For

However, the ranking does not account for total greenhouse gas emissions or the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which the industry says could cut a flight’s carbon footprint by up to 80%.

Wizz Air, for example, is still one of Europe’s most polluting airlines. It’s also among the fastest-growing, with over 70 new planes on order.

Since 2019, Wizz Air’s total emissions have nearly doubled, from 3,734,556 tonnes in 2019 to 7,962,308 tonnes in 2024, according to a report from Transport and Environment and the airline’s own sustainability data.

Yvonne Moynihan, the group’s ESG officer, previously told Skift that the rise in emissions is linked to the airline’s rapid growth under its “WIZZ500” strategy, which aims to double the fleet by 2033.

“This growth contributes to higher overall emissions,” she said. “But we emphasize carbon intensity per passenger-kilometer as a more relevant metric for assessing environmental impact.”

Moynihan acknowledged that reducing emissions while expanding is a significant challenge and that deeper cuts will depend on scaling up SAF, which is still barely used across the industry.

“We are actively pursuing fleet renewal and operational efficiency,” she said. “But broader reforms are needed across the industry to ensure success.”

Cirium excluded SAF from its 2024 analysis because it currently makes up just 0.53% of global aviation fuel use.

“SAF still emits CO₂,” said Jeremy Bowen, CEO of Cirium. “But today it makes up a very small fraction of fuel use. In the future, if SAF use ramps up, it will be taken into account.”

How Airlines Ranked

Cirium ranked airlines by CO₂ emissions per seat per kilometer in grams.

Here are the top performers:

Wizz Air: 53.9 grams of CO₂ per seat per kilometer

Fueling the Bioeconomy: Clean Energy Policies Driving Biotechnology Innovation

07.02.25 | 13 min read | Text by Nazish Jeffery & Addy Smith & Andy Gordon

The transition to a clean energy future and diversified sources of energy requires a fundamental shift in how we produce and consume energy across all sectors of the U.S. economy. The transportation sector, a sector that heavily relies on fossil-based energy, stands out not only because it is the sector that releases the most carbon into the atmosphere, but also for its progress in adopting next-generation technologies when it comes to new technologies and fuel alternatives.

Over the past several years, the federal government has made concerted efforts to support clean energy innovation in transportation, both for on-road and off-road. Particularly, in hard-to-electrify transportation sub-sectors, there has been added focus such as through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Grand Challenge. These efforts have enabled a wave of biotechnology-driven solutions to move from research labs to commercial markets, such as LanzaJets alcohol-to-jet technology in producing SAF. From renewable fuels to bio-based feedstocks, biotechnologies are enabling the replacement of fossil-derived energy sources and contributing to a more sustainable, secure, and diversified energy system.

SAF in particular has gained traction, enabled in part by public investment and interagency coordination, like the SAF Grand Challenge Roadmap. This increased federal attention demonstrated how strategic federal action, paired with demand signals from government, targeted incentives, and industry buy-in, can create the conditions needed to accelerate biotechnology adoption.

To better understand the factors driving this progress, FAS conducted a landscape analysis at the federal and regional level of biotechnology innovation within the clean energy sector, complemented by interviews with key stakeholders. Several policy mechanisms, public-private partnerships, and investment strategies were identified that were enablers of advanced SAF adoption and production and similar technologies. By identifying the enabling conditions that supported biotechnology’s uptake and commercialization, we aim to inform future efforts on how to accelerate other sectors that utilize biotechnologies and overall, strengthen the U.S. bioeconomy.

Key Findings & Recommendations

An analysis of the federal clean energy landscape reveals several critical insights that are vital for advancing the development and deployment of biotechnologies. Federal and regional strategies are central to driving innovation and facilitating the transition of biotechnologies from research to commercialization. The following key findings and actionable recommendations address the challenges and opportunities in accelerating this transition.

Federal Level Key Findings & Recommendations

The federal government plays a pivotal role in guiding market signals and investment toward national priorities. In the clean energy sector, decarbonizing aviation has emerged as a strategic objective, with SAF serving as a critical lever. Federal initiatives such as the SAF Grand Challenge, the SAF Roadmap, and the SAF Metrics Dashboard have helped to elevate SAF within national climate priorities and enabled greater interagency coordination. These mechanisms not only track progress but also communicate federal commitment. Still, despite these efforts, current SAF production remains far below target levels, with capacity largely concentrated in HEFA, a pathway with constrained feedstock availability and limited scalability.

This production gap reflects deeper structural challenges, many of which parallel broader issues across the clean-energy biotech interface. One of the main challenges is the fragmented, short-duration policy incentives currently in use. Tax credits like 40B and 45Z, while important, lack the longevity and clarity required to unlock large-scale, long-term private investment. The absence of binding fuel mandates further undermines market certainty. These policy gaps limit the ability of the clean energy sector to serve as a sustained demand signal for emerging biotechnologies and slow the transition from pilot to commercial scale.

Importantly, these challenges point to a broader opportunity: SAF as a test case for how the clean energy sector can serve as a driver of biotechnology uptake. Promising biotechnologies, such as alcohol-to-jet and power-to-liquid, are currently stalled by high capital costs, uncertain regulatory pathways, and a lack of coordinated federal support. Addressing these bottlenecks through aligned incentives, technology-neutral mandates, and harmonized accounting frameworks could not only accelerate SAF deployment but also establish a broader policy blueprint for scaling biotechnology across other clean energy applications.

To alleviate some of the challenges identified, the federal government should:

Extend & Clarify Incentives

While tax incentives such as the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit offer a promising framework to accelerate low-carbon fuel deployment, current design and implementation challenges limit their impact, particularly for emerging bio-based and synthetic fuels. To fully unlock the climate and market potential of these incentives, Congress and relevant agencies should take the following steps:

Congress should amend the 45Z tax credit structure to differentiate between fuel types, such as SAF, e-fuels, biofuels, and renewable diesel, based on life cycle CI and production pathways. This would better reflect technology-specific costs and accelerate deployment across multiple clean fuel markets, adding specificity as to how to utilize and earn the credits based on the type of fuel.

Congress should extend the duration of the 45Z credit and other clean-fuel related incentives to provide long-term policy certainty. Multi-year extensions with a defined minimum value floor would reduce investment risk and enable financing of capital-intensive projects.

Congress and the Department of Treasury should clarify eligibility to ensure inclusion of co-processing methods and hybrid production systems, which are currently in regulatory gray areas. This would ensure broader participation by innovative fuel producers.

Federal agencies, including the Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Transportation (DOT), and the Department of Defense, should be directed to enter into long-term (more than 10 years) procurement agreements for low-carbon fuels, including electrofuels and SAF. These offtake mechanisms would complement tax incentives and send strong market signals to producers and investors.

Scale Biotech Commercialization Support

The clean energy transition depends in part on the successful commercialization of enabling biotechnologies, ranging from advanced biofuels to bio-based carbon capture, SAF and biomanufacturing platforms that reduce industrial emissions. Recent or proposed funding cuts to clean energy programs risk stalling this progress and undermining U.S. competitiveness in the bioeconomy.

To accelerate biotechnology deployment and bridge the gap between lab-scale innovation and commercial-scale production, Congress should take the following actions:

Authorize and appropriate expanded funding to the DOE, particularly through Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO) and to the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to support pilot, demonstration, and first-of-a-kind commercial scale projects that enable biotechnology applications across clean energy sectors.

Direct and fund the DOE Loan Programs Office to establish a dedicated loan guarantee program focused on biotechnology commercialization, targeting platforms that can be integrated into the energy system, such as bio-based fuels, bioproducts, carbon utilization technologies, and electrification-enabling materials.

Encourage DOE and USDA to enter into long-term offtake agreements or structured purchasing mechanisms with qualified bioenergy and biomanufacturing companies. These agreements would help de-risk early commercial projects, crowd in private investment, and provide market certainty during the critical scale-up phase.

Strengthen public-private coordination mechanisms, such as cross-sector working groups or interagency task forces, to align commercialization support with industry needs, improve program targeting, and reduce time-to-market for promising technologies.

Design and Promote Next-Gen Biofuel Policies

To accelerate the deployment of low-carbon fuels and enable innovation in next-generation bioenergy technologies, Congress and relevant agencies should take the following actions:

Congress should direct the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to modernize the Renewable Fuel Standard by incorporating life cycle carbon intensity as a core metric, moving beyond volume-based mandates. Legislative authority could also support the development of a national Low Carbon Fuel Standard, modeled on successful state-level programs to drive demand for fuels with demonstrable climate benefits.

EPA should update its emissions accounting framework to reflect the latest science on life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, enabling more accurate assessment of advanced biofuels and synthetic fuels.

DOE should expand R&D and demonstration funding for biofuel pathways that meet stringent carbon performance thresholds, with an emphasis on scalability and compatibility.

Regional Level Key Findings & Recommendations

Regional strengths continue to serve as foundational drivers of clean energy innovation, with localized assets shaping the pace and direction of technology development. Federal designations, such as the Economic Development Administration (EDA) Tech Hub program (Tech Hub), have proven catalytic. These initiatives enable regions to unlock state-level co-investment, attract private capital, and align workforce training programs with local industry needs. Early signs suggest that the Tech Hub framework is helping to seed innovation ecosystems where they are most needed, but long-term impact will depend on sustained funding support and continued regional coordination.

Workforce readiness and enabling infrastructure remain critical differentiators. Regions with deep and committed involvement from major research universities, national labs, or advanced manufacturing clusters are better positioned to scale innovation from prototype to deployment. Real-world testbeds provide environments for stress-testing technologies and accelerating regulatory and market readiness, reinforcing the importance of place-based strategies in federal innovation planning.

At the same time, private investment in clean energy and enabling biotechnologies remains crucial to developing and scaling innovative technologies. High capital costs, regulatory uncertainty, and limited early-stage demand signals continue to inhibit market entry, especially in geographies with less mature innovation ecosystems. Addressing these barriers through coordinated federal procurement, long-term incentives, and regional capacity-building will be essential to supporting growth in regions with strong assets to develop industry clusters that could yield clean energy benefits.

To accomplish this, the federal government and regional governments should:

Strengthen Regional Workforce Pipelines

A skilled and regionally distributed workforce is essential to realizing the full economic and technological potential of clean energy investments, particularly as they intersect with the bioeconomy. While federal funding is accelerating deployment through initiatives such as the IRA and DOE programs, workforce gaps, especially outside major innovation hubs, pose barriers to implementation. Addressing these gaps through targeted education, training, and talent retention efforts will be critical to ensuring that clean energy projects deliver durable, regionally inclusive economic growth. To this end:

Federal agencies like the Department of Education and National Science Foundation should explore expanding support for STEM programs at community colleges and Minority Serving Institutions, with a focus on biosciences, engineering, and agricultural technologies relevant to the clean energy transition.

Federally supported training and reskilling programs tailored to regional clean energy and biomanufacturing workforce needs could benefit new and existing cross-sector partnerships between state workforce agencies and regional employers.

State and local governments should consider implementing talent retention strategies, including local hiring incentives, relocation support, and career placement services, to ensure that skilled workers remain in and contribute to regional clean energy ecosystems.

Strengthen Regional Infrastructure and Foster Cross-Sector Collaboration

Robust regional infrastructure and cross-sector collaboration are essential to accelerating the deployment of clean energy technologies that leverage advancements in biotechnology and manufacturing. Strategic investments in shared facilities, modernized logistics, and coordinated innovation ecosystems will strengthen supply chain resilience and improve technology transfer across sectors. Facilitating access to R&D infrastructure, particularly for small and mid-sized enterprises, will ensure that innovation is not limited to large firms or major metropolitan areas. To support these outcomes:

Federal support for regional testbeds, prototyping sites, and grid modernization labs, coordinated by agencies such as DOE and EDA, would support the demonstration and scaling of biologically enabled clean energy technologies.

State and local governments, in coordination with federal agencies including DOT and DOC, explore investment in logistics infrastructure to enhance supply chain reliability and support distributed manufacturing.

States should consider creating or expanding the use of innovation voucher programs that allow small and mid-sized enterprises to access national lab facilities, pilot-scale infrastructure, and technical expertise, fostering cross-sector collaboration between clean energy, biotech, and advanced manufacturing firms.

Attract and De-Risk Private Capital

Attracting and de-risking private capital is critical for scaling clean energy and biotechnology innovations. By offering targeted financial mechanisms and leveraging federal visibility, governments can reduce the financial uncertainties that often deter private investment. Effective strategies, such as state-backed loan guarantees and co-investment models, can help bridge funding gaps while strategic partnerships with philanthropic and venture capital entities can unlock additional resources for emerging technologies. To this end:

State governments, in collaboration with the federal agencies such as DOE and Treasury, should consider implementing state-backed loan guarantees and co-investment models to attract private capital into high-risk clean energy and biotech projects.

Federal agencies like EDA, DOE, and the SBA should explore additional programs and partnerships to attract philanthropic and venture capital to emerging clean energy technologies, particularly in underserved regions.

Federal agencies should increase efforts to facilitate connecting early-stage companies with potential investors, using federal initiatives to build investor confidence and reduce perceived risks in the clean energy sector.

Cross-Cutting Key Findings

The successful deployment of federal clean energy and biotechnology initiatives, such as the SAF Grand Challenge, relies heavily on the capacity of regional ecosystems and the private sector to absorb and implement national goals. Many regions, particularly those outside established innovation hubs, lack the infrastructure, resources, and technical expertise to effectively utilize federal funding. As a result, the impact of national policies is often limited, and the full potential of federal investments goes unrealized in certain areas.

Federal programs often take a one-size-fits-all approach, overlooking regional variability in feedstocks, industrial bases and cost structures. Programs like tax credits and life cycle analysis models can unintentionally disadvantage regions with different economic contexts, creating disparities in access to federal incentives. This lack of regional customization prevents certain areas from fully benefiting from national clean energy and biotech initiatives.

The diffusion of innovation in clean energy and biotechnology remains concentrated in a few key regions, leaving others underutilized. Despite robust federal R&D investments, commercialization and scaling of innovations are primarily concentrated in regions with established infrastructure, hindering the broader geographic spread of these technologies. In addition, workforce development efforts across federal and regional programs are fragmented, creating misalignments in talent pipelines and further limiting the ability of local industries to leverage available resources effectively. The absence of a unified system for tracking key metrics, such as SAF production and emissions reductions, makes it difficult to coordinate efforts or assess progress consistently across regions. To address this, the federal and regional governments should:

Create a Federal–Regional Clean Energy Deployment Compact

A Federal-Regional Clean Energy Deployment Compact is critical for aligning federal clean energy initiatives with the unique capabilities and needs of regional ecosystems. By establishing formal mechanisms, such as intergovernmental councils and regional liaisons, federal programs can be more effectively tailored to local conditions. These mechanisms will ensure two-way communication between federal agencies and regional stakeholders, fostering a collaborative approach that adapts to evolving technological, economic, and environmental conditions. In addition, treating regional tech hubs and initiatives as testbeds for new policy tools, such as performance-based incentives or carbon standards, will allow for innovative solutions to be tested locally before scaling them nationally, ensuring that policies are effective and contextually relevant across diverse regions. To this end:

The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in collaboration with the DOE and EPA, should establish formal intergovernmental councils or regional liaisons to facilitate ongoing dialogue between federal agencies and regional stakeholders. These councils would focus on aligning federal clean energy initiatives with regional needs, ensuring that local priorities, such as feedstock availability or infrastructure readiness, are considered in policy design.

The DOE and EPA should treat tech hubs and regional clean energy initiatives as testbeds for policy innovation. These regions can pilot performance-based incentives, carbon standards, and other policy tools to assess their effectiveness before scaling them nationally. Successful models developed in these testbeds should be expanded to other regions, with lessons learned shared across state and local governments.

Regional universities and innovation hubs should collaborate with federal and state agencies to develop pilot programs that test new policy tools and technologies. These institutions can serve as incubators for innovative clean energy solutions, providing valuable data on what policies work best in specific regional contexts.

Build a National Innovation-to-Deployment Pipeline

Creating a seamless innovation-to-deployment pipeline is essential for scaling clean energy technologies and ensuring that regional ecosystems can fully participate in national clean energy transitions. By linking DOE national labs, Tech Hubs, and regional consortia into a coordinated network, the U.S. can support the full life cycle of innovation, from early-stage R&D to commercialization and deployment, across diverse geographies. Additionally, co-developing curricula and training programs between federal agencies, regional tech hubs, and industry partners will ensure that talent pipelines are closely aligned with the evolving needs of the clean energy sector, providing the skilled workforce necessary to implement and scale innovations effectively. To accomplish this the:

DOE should facilitate the creation of a national network that connects federal labs, regional tech hubs and innovation consortia. This network would provide a clear pathway for the transition of technologies from research to commercialization, ensuring that innovations can be deployed across different regions based on local needs and capacities.

Regional Tech Hubs, in partnership with local universities and research institutions, should be integrated into the pipeline to provide localized innovation support and commercialization expertise. These hubs can act as nodes in the broader network, offering the infrastructure and expertise necessary for scaling up clean energy technologies.

Develop a Shared Metrics and Monitoring Platform

A centralized dashboard for tracking key metrics related to clean energy and biotechnology initiatives is crucial for guiding investment and policy decisions. By integrating federal and regional data can provide a comprehensive, real-time view of progress across the country. This shared platform would enable better coordination among federal, state, and local agencies, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently and that policy decisions are informed by accurate, up-to-date data. Moreover, a unified system would allow for more effective tracking of regional performance, enabling tailored solutions and based on localized needs and challenges. To this end:

The DOE, in partnership with the EPA, should lead the development of a centralized dashboard that integrates existing federal and regional data on SAF production, emissions reductions, workforce needs, and infrastructure gaps. This platform should be publicly accessible, allowing stakeholders at all levels to monitor progress and identify opportunities for improvement.

State and local governments should contribute relevant data from regional initiatives, including workforce training programs, infrastructure development projects, and emissions reductions efforts. These contributions would help ensure that the platform reflects the full range of activities across different regions, providing a more accurate picture of national progress.

The Department of Labor and the DOC should integrate workforce development and industrial capacity data into the platform. This would include information on training programs, regional workforce readiness, and skills gaps, helping policymakers align talent development efforts with regional needs.

The DOT should ensure that transportation infrastructure data, particularly related to SAF production and distribution networks, is included in the platform. This would provide a comprehensive view of the supply chain and infrastructure readiness necessary to scale clean energy technologies across regions.

The clean energy sector, and specifically SAF, highlights both the promise and the persistent challenges of scaling biotechnologies, reflecting broader issues, such as fragmented regulation, limited commercialization support, and misaligned incentives that hinder the deployment of advanced biotechnologies. Overcoming these systemic barriers requires coordinated, long-term policies including performance-based incentives, and procurement mechanisms that reduce investment risk and free up capital. SAF should be seen not as a standalone initiative but as a model for integrating biotechnology into industrial and energy strategy, supported by a robust innovation pipeline, expanded infrastructure, and shared metrics to guide progress. With sustained federal leadership and strategic alignment, the bioeconomy can become a key pillar of a low-carbon, resilient energy future.",https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/0702-bioeconomy-blog.png,N,,2025-07-02 12:23:16.840572

When there is a match, airlines and suppliers can connect and take their negotiation offline to agree on specific terms including price and payment terms.

Specifically, the SAF Matchmaker addresses three critical issues:

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. It will therefore facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes while airlines are able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes. Subsequent trades will take place outside the platform.

Visibility: The platform carries comprehensive information regarding the available SAF, such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

“To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market.

So this is the mea culpa: I was wrong in thinking that biomethanol would not be the shipping fuel of the future.","For the past week I’ve been working with a team of deep and broad experts in decarbonization in the Netherlands. The transmission system operator TenneT invited me and other experts to assist them with their Target scenario for 2050 to enable them to plan for transmission upgrades and space requirements in a country where land is so precious that they make their own, building entire provinces from sea beds, dykes, and massive pumps.

The TenneT core team were deep and broad in their own ways. Emiel van Druten, who led the charge on scenario planning, with a decade of modeling background in energy across Dutch economy, has a sharp-eyed view on where the football will be. Emmanuel van Ruitenbeek brought aerospace engineering, a masters in sustainability, and a decade of European energy trading to the table. Tim Gaßmann brought power engineering and a decade of energy planning to the room, along with a deep understanding of how the core scenario tool, the Energy Transition Model, and related external dashboard hang together.

A brief shoutout to the Energy Transition Model (ETM). This free, browser-based toolkit from Amsterdam’s Quintel puts you in the driver’s seat, letting you build future energy systems with a dizzying array of sliders, around 300 by the last count. Want to see what happens if your region doubles down on heat pumps or scraps coal by 2050? Just tweak the supply and demand bars and watch as charts, emissions figures, and costs update in real time. It’s transparent, open-source, and refreshingly honest, with no hidden assumptions, no techno-liturgical claptrap. Every European country is baselined in it, but seemingly no non-European countries at this time. That should change. The TenneT team and the larger national scenario modeling team have been using ETM for years, and I was deeply impressed with it and that they were so familiar with the levers to pull as we explored options.

The external expert team was diverse. Professor Heleen de Coninck is a Dutch climate scientist and professor specializing in technology, innovation, and societal change for decarbonization. She is widely respected for her authoritative role as Coordinating Lead Author for the IPCC’s landmark Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C. De Coninck’s research critically examines the intersection of climate policy, carbon capture, renewable energy systems, and sustainable innovation. Her insights are frequently sought by policymakers and academia for nuanced analysis of how technology choices shape climate outcomes and social equity. Currently, she is a professor at Eindhoven University of Technology, guiding research and dialogue on actionable pathways toward deep decarbonization. She held our feet to the fire on negative emissions pathways, something we actually found.

Reinier Grimbergen is a prominent Dutch expert on industrial transformation and sustainability, who served as Principal Consultant at TNO, the Netherlands’ leading applied research institute. With a PhD in solid-state chemistry from Radboud University, Grimbergen spent nearly two decades at DSM, driving innovation strategy, corporate sustainability, and R&D leadership. His current work focuses on electrification, renewable feedstocks, and circularity within Europe’s heavy industrial sectors, particularly chemicals and materials. Grimbergen is deeply involved in shaping Europe’s Green Deal initiatives and industry-wide collaboration through platforms such as VoltaChem and Brightsite. His insights into the chemical industry in the Netherlands were key to our approach.

Last but not least of the external experts was Paul Martin, a Canadian chemical engineer with over three decades of experience in hydrogen, syngas, and industrial process development, with dozens of projects developing modular chemical processing plants of all types. As founder of Spitfire Research, he combines hands‑on expertise in designing and scaling pilot‑to‑commercial plants with a keen no‑nonsense approach to decarbonization. A co‑founder of the Hydrogen Science Coalition, Martin is a trusted contrarian voice in the energy transition, questioning hydrogen “hopium” and advocating for practical, efficiency‑first solutions.

The TenneT team included numerous others who came and went from the different sessions, bringing insights or listening to the evolving solution. I was deeply impressed with the insights and strategic clarity of the organization. From the TenneT Board downward throughout the organization, the Target scenario I and the other external experts assisted with is central to their strategic planning, and the priority they have given to it is a key takeaway for other organizations.

The overall Netherlands’ process is equally admirable, although with shortcomings. Nothing is perfect, but that they have a 2050 scenario planning exercise playing out that includes all energy and power sectors, all utilities, all industrial sectors and most major corporations operating in the country is extraordinary. The final results are an excellent set of scenarios that bound the solution space.

However, the high-electrification scenario had systemic challenges which TenneT needed to overcome. The external experts were asked to provide their insights and opinions on a series of specific and broad points to identify a more likely scenario, and overcome inconsistencies that the process had inserted. A PESTEL analysis had identified multiple high, median and low options, and the process ensured that each potential extreme was represented in at least one of the four scenarios. The Target scenario needed to be cleansed of unlikely extremes, for example the persistence of 60% of fossil fuel refining in the country.

And now we start to get to the mea culpa and the good news that comes along with it. The Netherlands is the refinery for Europe, with very large crude carriers steaming into its major ports to feed its five massive refineries. While ground transportation had broad agreement in the high electrification scenario as almost entirely electrified, with a mere 10% of heavy goods vehicles running on hydrogen to eliminate, the core question of aviation and shipping energy remained.

I’ve been looking at the question of demand for years, with projections of both maritime shipping and aviation volumes through 2100 in the public domain, along with innumerable analyses of the pathways to decarbonization. My broad opinion remains unchanged, in that it will still be batteries and biofuels powering the ships and planes of the future. As always with my projections, I don’t claim to be right, just less wrong than most, and when I find out I’m wrong about something, I massage my perspective, not the facts. Case in point: this article.

Aviation will electrify far more than most think, with battery hybrid turboprops carrying 100 passengers flying 1,000 km routes, divert and reserve provided by biokerosene. Those flights will be cheaper than current flights because operations and maintenance of simple electric drive trains with many fewer moving parts powered by high-efficiency and cheap electrons will be cheaper. Long-haul flights will be more expensive, quite a bit more expensive, as airlines add sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) surcharges to ticket prices. The combination will be a reduction in long-haul flights and an increase in vacationers traveling more locally, simply because a lot more people will be able to afford 1,000 km electric flights than 4,000 km SAF-powered flights for their families.

But those long-haul flights need kerosene, and a lot of it. The cheapest way to make kerosene that doesn’t include fossil fuels is from vegetable oils that are hydrogenated, with about 36 kilograms of hydrogen as a chemical feedstock per ton of end fuel. This is starting to get to the nub of what I got wrong.

The same vegetable oils can be processed differently to create diesel-equivalent fuels for ships, and are in large tonnages today. My assumption was that with the lower overall shipping demand, they would compete with aviation for those fuels, and would be powered by them.

The lower shipping demand is due to 40% of total tonnages being fossil fuels, a set that will decline radically with decarbonization in the coming decades, and a general economic shift to more local processing due to higher shipping costs. Only the lightest, sweetest crudes will be in tankers, and they will be steaming to electrified petrochemical refineries, not refineries set up to make diesel, kerosene and gasoline. I and the other experts agreed that burning fossil hydrocarbons makes no sense in a decarbonized future, but that the best source of the durable, non-burning products we make from fossil hydrocarbons today is fossil hydrocarbons in the future.

Another 15% of total tonnage is raw iron ore, steaming to the same ports the bulk coal carriers are berthing at. As I noted recently with my update to global iron and steel demand, China makes and uses half of all steel in the world, and half of that goes into buildings. With China’s infrastructure and building boom over, and the country shifting into maintenance and replacement mode, their steel production and demand is necessarily declining. The rest of the developing world will not create a market as large as the last few decades in the Middle Kingdom, so global production will decline.

Further, the economics of making iron are shifting radically, with different low-carbon technologies having bigger and smaller niches. The world will shift to America’s 70% plus supply from electric arc furnaces fed with scrap. The much smaller new steel requirements, in the range of 400 million tons a year, will be met by combinations of biomethane direct reduction with electrified process heat where biomethane is plentiful and ore grades are high, molten oxide electrolysis which requires only iron ore and electricity where ore grades are poorer and renewable resources are massive and without competition, and finally flash iron making where biomethane resources are high and ore grades are low.

While a couple of these have low technology readiness levels, I’m comfortable that they are more likely than green hydrogen direct reduction of iron, as I published recently., simply because hydrogen can be green, but it can’t be cheap and the same environmental and economic drivers that make it not viable as a ground transportation fuel — or indeed a fuel of any kind — make it uneconomic for new steel. The same illusions of cheap green hydrogen that powered the past decade of policy missteps and transportation failures also powered the illusion that green iron made with hydrogen would be cheap. Virtually all iron and steel manufacturers are backing away from hydrogen direct reduction, something that also requires high-grade ores, because it has become clear that the economics make absolutely zero sense.

The important part for the maritime shipping question is that the much smaller amounts of new iron will mostly be made much nearer to iron mines where there is an abundance of either biomass or renewable electricity resource with limited competition, and only the iron will be shipped. Iron is half the mass of the iron ore it comes from, and less iron will be required, so the 15% of shipping of raw iron ore will decline substantially as well.

So overall shipping tonnages, especially transoceanic, will decline. There is no world in which the minority tonnages of container shipping will grow to fill the void left by perhaps 50% of tonnage going away, especially in a world with more expensive shipping fuels. As a reminder, the best number I have is that 11% of fossil fuels are used to extract, process, refine and distribute fossil fuels, so the total amount of energy and remaining hydrocarbons for petrochemicals is smaller than most realize.

There’s another lever that’s important in this regard, electrification. I’ve been bullish on batteries for vessels for a long time, and I keep being proven right. My assertion for years has been that all inland shipping and most short sea shipping would simply electrify. I updated that in the past year or so with the expectation of hybridized transoceanic vessels, with all navigation within 200 km of land being on batteries. That too reduces fuel demand.

Shipping fuels will be more expensive, where electrons can’t be used. The cheapest available low carbon shipping fuels are the previously mentioned hydrogenated vegetable oils, termed HVO in shipping circles. They are currently 2-3 times the cost of the very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO) which currently is bunkered for large ships. The next cheapest is biologically sourced methanol, which has only 45% of the energy density of VLSFO, so on a cost per unit of energy are more expensive than HVO.

While having some flaws, the basic insights of the 2022 Nature paper by Kersey et al out of Berkeley Lab in the USA remain valid. Mass and weight of batteries aren’t limiting factors for shipping, the cost per kWh of energy is. While the numbers aren’t perfect, they found that at $100 / kWh, trips of 1,500 km broken even economically. At $50 / kWh, 3,000 km routes would electrify because it was cheaper.

China’s latest energy storage auction saw the $51 / kWh as the average bid for four hour LFP battery energy storage systems. That’s all components and systems in the full battery system, deployed, operated and maintained for a couple of decades. Grid batteries and ship batteries have remarkably similar requirements and constraints, so what grid batteries cost is going to be what ship batteries cost. This isn’t the end of the reductions in BESS costs. It’s going to get close to the cost of materials, but that means substitutability as well. China continues to invest in sodium ion batteries despite them not currently being cost competitive with LFP.

As with aviation and road transport, the simplicity and efficiency of battery electric drive trains will turn directly into cost reductions that shipping operators will exploit and lean into. 70% of all ferry orders today are have electric drive trains, and where they are hybrid there are usually plans to fully electrify. The largest ferries in the world, capable of carrying thousands of passengers and hundreds of cars, are now on order with fully electric drive trains. There are 700 unit container ships plying 1,000 km routes on the Yangtze, winching discharge containerized batteries off and charged containers of batteries on in ports along the route. An 850 unit container ship, fully electrified, is on order in northern Europe. Tug boats, tenders and lighters are all electrifying.

But back to molecultes. If all else were equal, and I mistakenly thought all else was equal, ship operators would buy the cheapest fuel and bunker HVO. This had the significant advantage of requiring no changes for ports, with blends in existing tanks and the same pumps and hoses being reusable with no modifications. Procurement and monitoring would be required, but those are minimal compared to alternatives like methanol, where a complete set of new bunkering infrastructure would be required and no blending would be possible.

However, there are reasonable limits to the amount of vegetable oils that can be procured to make HVO, and the same vegetable oils are the cheapest pathway to biokerosene, the winning sustainable aviation fuel. And crucially, while ships can burn almost literally anything, jets absolutely require kerosene.

Further, aviation is a much higher margin business than shipping, and fuel is only 19% of the average carrier’s operational expenses. The lack of substitutability of the molecules in kerosene for jet engines, the availability of the vegetable oil to jet fuel pathway, and the much higher cost of alternative pathways to jet fuel such as ethanol to jet means that the aviation industry will pay more for the available vegetable oil to heavy fuel than the shipping industry will be willing to pay.

The aviation industry will consistently bid up the price of vegetable oil for SAF over the price of alternatives available to the shipping industry like biomethanol. The shipping industry won’t get the cheap HVO because the aviation industry will bid it up above the cost of the more expensive to make biomethanol. Whatever biomethanol costs, aviation will pay more than that for biokerosene. Effectively, the cost of biomethanol is the low end of aviation fuel costs.

Currently biomethanol is coming in from $1,000 to $1,500 per ton, or $2,200 to $3,300 for the same energy as in a ton of HVO, a price expected to come down a bit as volumes increase, but not to fossil fuel levels. A ton of HVO meanwhile, cost an average of $1,600 per ton and a ton of VLSFO costs $500 to $650 per ton. Yes, shipping fuels are going to get a lot more expensive, four to six times as expensive, but so are aviation fuels, which see similar ratios and as noted will bid the HVO equivalent up above the biomethanol price point. The International Maritime Organization’s recent decision to put carbon pricing on fuels will ensure that they pay the price or get out of the shipping business.

Of course, hydrogen-based synthetic fuels are completely out of the running. In the best possible case scenario they are more expensive than biofuels, and so while some will undoubtedly be made in some cases to fill gaps in the market, they won’t be more than a few percent.

That merit order of competition drove a lot of discussions. Paul Martin was integral to this, shaped by his decades prototyping chemical processing plants where feedstocks had key trade offs. I’m indebted to him for this clarity, as I knew we disagreed on HVO vs biomethanol for shipping, but we hadn’t found time to discuss it at length and arrive at a conclusion, at least on my part.

I said there was good news with this. The biggest piece of good news is that the global shipping industry paid absolutely no attention to my opinion that methanol wasn’t the end fuel choice. 14% of new ship orders are dual-fuel with methanol this year. 30% are dual-fuel with LNG, which is a dead end due to methane slippage and supply chain leakage making it usually higher carbon than VLSFO. There is still confusion in the space, to which I inadvertently contributed.

The other piece of good news from my perspective is that with high biomethanol prices, plummeting battery costs, increasing energy densities, chemistries with vanishingly small chances of thermal runaway and the increasing proof points of ships running on batteries, hybridization of heavy ships will be triggered sooner rather than later. The transoceanic industry doesn’t appear to have caught on to this, but hybridization means so much cheaper energy costs that the capital costs of batteries will pay for itself rapidly.

Remember the 3,000 km breakeven at $50 per kWh? That was against VLSFO, not biomethanol. Against biomethanol, the breakeven point is a lot further. Electrons are always going to be a lot cheaper per unit of energy than biomethanol. As soon as a ship hybridizes, it’s going to burn every single electron before it burns a single drop of biomethanol.

There are still limits to battery chemistry, but my current assumption has shifted the goalposts substantially. All inland shipping will still electrify, but now I think virtually all short sea shipping will be battery powered, 98% or so. There are some weird, long coastal routes where some methanol will be required, but the end game is virtually all electrons. Everything in inland seas including the Mediterranean will be electric, barring some Suez Canal traffic.

The Canal, and every other major canal globally, becomes an opportunity for electron bunkering. Container ships transiting it are much more likely to winch containers of batteries on and off while they are necessarily stopped en route due to the nature of canals and lock systems. That’s going to maximize electrons as well, with massive wind, solar and battery farms in Egypt charging containerized batteries for the ship trade. At present they are exploring making synthetic methanol, but as noted, that’s going to be priced out of the market, and Egypt’s limited biomass doesn’t make it a good choice for making much biomethanol.

And that 200 km from coastlines I mentioned earlier as the part of ocean journeys that would be running on electrons? It’s going to turn into thousands of kilometers of journeys. My expectation is that trans Atlantic journeys will routinely be fully electric in 2100, and that a full 60% of global shipping energy demand will be battery powered.

That reduces the total energy demand from liquid fuels in my projection to 30 million tons of VLSFO equivalent, or about 60 million tons of biomethanol given the energy density difference. That’s good news for the global methanol industry, although nowhere near their dreams of tripling or quadrupling global demand.

So this is the mea culpa: I was wrong in thinking that biomethanol would not be the shipping fuel of the future. My economic analysis didn’t include merit order competition. The people I’ve spoken to who said that aviation would take the vegetable oils required for both SAF and HVO were right. And I was wrong about the degree of electrification, once again underestimating the plummeting costs of batteries and contrasting with HVO costs, not biomethanol costs.

Liquid fuel demand goes down further. Bulk shipping plummets. Container ships winch containers of charged batteries on board along with cargo. Ports are much quieter, cleaner and healthier. Global trade continues, but the climate change impacts plummet. The world becomes a better place. Those parts of my projection remain unchanged, but the molecules and molecules/electron ratio changes. I can live with that.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-2-2025-10_53_26-AM-800x533.png,N,,2025-07-02 12:23:28.661150

This insight comes from Rafael Schwartzman, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) regional vice president for Europe, in an interview with domestic media.
Schwartzman emphasised that increasing SAF production is a crucial step toward achieving zero carbon emissions in aviation, noting that SAF can cut carbon emissions by as much as 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.
“We recognise and support Azerbaijan’s efforts to promote SAF, despite current regulatory and commercial obstacles within the country,” Schwartzman said.
“Building stronger partnerships with SAF suppliers and optimising fuel procurement will be vital for Azerbaijan Airlines to stay economically efficient while meeting EU sustainability standards.","Azerbaijan’s abundant energy resources position the country well to develop sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production — a sector expected to see rising global demand in the coming years.

Schwartzman emphasised that increasing SAF production is a crucial step toward achieving zero carbon emissions in aviation, noting that SAF can cut carbon emissions by as much as 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

“Azerbaijan Airlines (AZAL) flights to Europe will be significantly impacted by the new EU ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, which mandates a gradual increase in the use of SAF at European airports,” said Schwartzman. “The goal is to reduce emissions by requiring the blending of SAF with conventional fuel, with SAF expected to make up to 70% of total fuel volume by 2050.”

He added that while AZAL has already begun investing in SAF and has joined the ReFuelEU initiative, complying with the new regulations may present operational challenges. These include higher fuel costs and potential supply limitations at European airports.

“We recognise and support Azerbaijan’s efforts to promote SAF, despite current regulatory and commercial obstacles within the country,” Schwartzman said. “Building stronger partnerships with SAF suppliers and optimising fuel procurement will be vital for Azerbaijan Airlines to stay economically efficient while meeting EU sustainability standards. To speed up SAF adoption in Azerbaijan, the country might consider accepting ASTM international standards as an alternative or supplement to the currently used GOST standards.”

The site will serve as a model for scalable, low-cost sustainable aviation fuel production. This company milestone advances Syzygy’s mission to seize the significant global opportunity to profitably convert biogas into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using clean electricity.

Located in Durazno, Uruguay, NovaSAF 1 will produce over 350,000 gallons of ASTM Certified SAF annually, marking a breakthrough in cost-effective, scalable clean fuel. The project is backed by long-term feedstock and site agreements with Estancias del Lago (EDL), one of Uruguay’s largest dairy and agri-energy operations. Permitting and equipment sourcing is ongoing alongside front-end engineering work led by Kent, a world leader in SAF project development and execution.

Powered by Syzygy’s proprietary NovaSAF™ platform, the facility combines the benefits of biogas and Power-to-Liquids (PtL) technologies, leveraging waste as feedstock, eliminating the need for pipelines or costly separation while achieving ultra-low water use and carbon intensity. Syzygy’s electrified pathway can potentially qualify as a RFNBO to meet EU regulations. Unique to NovaSAF™ is the ability to provide these social and carbon benefits at a production cost that is unmatched by traditional SAF alternatives like HEFA, ATJ, or PtL. The result is a clean fuel solution that is not only scalable and sustainable, but also economically viable by delivering Jet-A parity fuel when fully commercialized.

“This is more than just a SAF plant. It’s a new model for biogas economics,” said Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics. “We’re unlocking a global asset class of underutilized biogas sites and turning them into high-value clean fuel hubs without pipelines, costly gas separation, or subsidy dependence. We believe NovaSAF™ represents one of the few viable pathways to producing SAF at Jet Parity and successfully decarbonizing air travel.”

Background

Hydrogen plays an important role in decarbonising industrial processes and industries for which reducing carbon emissions is both urgent and hard to achieve. Hydrogen and its derivatives such as ammonia, methanol and certain sustainable aviation fuels are therefore essential to support the EU’s commitment to reach climate neutrality by 2050 and in its objective to become independent from Russian fossil fuels by the end of 2027.

The Regulation on the internal markets for renewable gas, natural gas and hydrogen (EU/2024/1789) mandates the Commission to set up and operate a mechanism under the European Hydrogen Bank to support the market development of hydrogen for a limited duration until the end of 2029.

The Hydrogen Mechanism aims to empower market participants by matching and aggregating demand and supply, help to identify needs related to the development of infrastructure and making it easier to access information on financial solutions.

The excitement continued in Calgary on June 7, where the Plane Pull for Sight once again captured the hearts of spectators and participants alike. With 360 determined individuals, including 200 dedicated FedEx team members, the Calgary event was a resounding success. Over 1,000 attendees watched in awe as teams showcased their strength and commitment to Orbis's mission. By this point, the campaign's total fundraising efforts exceeded $245,000, further supporting initiatives to end avoidable blindness in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.

A grand finale in Vancouver

The final leg of the campaign unfolded in Vancouver on June 22, wrapping up with an impressive display of teamwork and community spirit. More than 25 teams, including more than 300 FedEx team members, competed in this friendly contest, bringing the grand total of participants across all three cities to over 1,500. The Vancouver event pushed the campaign's total fundraising to an incredible $282,000 (and counting), a testament to the power of pulling together for a noble cause.

A vision for the future

Since its inception in 2009, the Plane Pull for Sight events have raised over 2.9 million dollars for Orbis Canada. These funds are vital for providing critical eye care training, sight-saving treatments, and a brighter future for millions around the globe. The 2025 campaign not only highlighted the generosity and determination of each community but also reignited hope for a world where no one is needlessly blind.

Japan is targeting a 10 per cent SAF mandate by 2030.
India will have a one per cent SAF mandate on international flights by 2027, rising to five per cent by 2030.
Matthew Cope, American biofuel reporter for Argus, said the SAF supply and demand situation is much further behind in North America.
However, there won’t be enough UCO to supply the sector by the time the EU achieves its 20 per cent mandate by 2035.","SASKATOON — Sustainable aviation fuel is finally taking off, say analysts.

“A lot of global consumption is going to be underpinned by the mandates in Europe and the United Kingdom,” said Fabricio Cardoso, principal at Argus Consulting.

Both of those regions introduced two per cent SAF mandates in 2025 and will be driving global demand going forward, he said during a recent webinar hosted by the company.

Alfonso Berrocal, business development manager for oil products with Argus, estimates that the European Union and U.K. mandates will generate 1.5 to 1.7 million tonnes of demand in 2025.

The EU mandate remains at two per cent for the first five years and then moves to six per cent.

The U.K. mandate is more ambitious in the short-term, growing to 10 per cent by 2030 and 22 per cent by 2040.

However, the EU mandate is bigger in the long-term, climbing to 20 per cent by 2035 and 70 per cent by 2050.

Lindsey Liu, senior Argus analyst covering the Chinese biofuel market, said the Asia Pacific region is a bit behind the EU and U.K., but mandates are coming.

Japan is targeting a 10 per cent SAF mandate by 2030.

Singapore will go to one per cent by 2026, rising to three to five per cent by 2030.

Thailand’s is one per cent by 2026, climbing to three per cent by 2030.

India will have a one per cent SAF mandate on international flights by 2027, rising to five per cent by 2030.

China has no national mandate. Instead, it has set a 50,000 tonne SAF target for 2025 that will be met through airport level blend targets for select airlines at key airports in Beijing, Chengdu, Zhengshou and Ningbo.

Indonesia has a 2.5 per cent target for 2030, while Malaysia and South Korea have one per cent targets.

Australia has no planned mandate, but one is likely coming with the re-election of the Labor government in May.

Liu said there are SAF proposals in most of the major markets in the Asia Pacific region, but there is still considerable policy uncertainty, which is leaving producers wary.

“A lack of firm policy support in most countries in the region is slowing development of the sector and causing timelines of many planned projects to be postponed,” she said.

There are close to 50 announced projects in the region, but many are a long way from producing.

Matthew Cope, American biofuel reporter for Argus, said the SAF supply and demand situation is much further behind in North America.

“This market is far less developed than what we’re seeing in Europe and Asia,” he said.

It is a market that will be driven by tax credits rather than mandates.

Producers are still awaiting clarity on the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit, which will pay up to US$1.75 per gallon for SAF.

Cardoso said when it’s all added up, there will be about 15 billion litres of annual global demand by 2030 and 30 billion litres by 2035.

However, there is a big caveat.

“Obviously, any mandate coming from China could have a massive impact on overall demand,” he said.

As it sits, there will be more global capacity than demand until 2035 when demand finally surpasses capacity.

And that is only using projects that are under construction or have achieved a final investment decision.

If you factor in “very provisional” proposed plants that have not secured financing, the capacity far outstrips demand well beyond 2035.

The burning question for many in the agriculture sector is — what feedstock will be used to make the jet fuel?

“We would expect SAF to be coming primarily from UCO (used cooking oil),” said Cardosa.

However, there won’t be enough UCO to supply the sector by the time the EU achieves its 20 per cent mandate by 2035.

A wide assortment of feedstocks will be needed by that time.

“This initiative reflects Sarawak’s intent to contribute meaningfully to global aviation decarbonisation efforts, while building domestic capability in clean fuel manufacturing,” Sulzer stated.
“In collaboration with SAF technology provider Sulzer, we are confident in our ability to make this showcase SAF plant a flagship success in Sarawak,” said Oiltek.
It also built a crude POME oil treatment plant in Sarawak that supplies high-quality feedstock to HVO producers in Singapore and Europe.
This SAF pilot plant initiative comes amid the global aviation industry’s transition toward low-carbon fuels, driven by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).","By DayakDaily Team

KUCHING, July 2: SEDC Energy (SEDCE) is exploring the development of a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) pilot plant with an initial capacity of 15,000 tonnes per annum (15KTA), utilising Sulzer’s cutting-edge Bioflux technology with a scalable potential to meet the growing regional demand for SAF.

According to a joint media release today, the pilot plant programme marked a major collaboration between Sarawak and Swiss technology leader Sulzer, in positioning the State at the forefront of clean aviation fuel development.

SEDC Energy signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Sulzer and Apeiron Bioenergy, with Oiltek expressing support, witnessed by Deputy Minister of Energy and Environmental Sustainability (MEESty) Datuk Dr Hazland Abang Hipni and Sarawak Economic Development Corporation (SEDC) chairman Tan Sri Abdul Aziz Husain. The ceremony was held in conjunction with MyAero Sustainable Aviation APAC Symposium in Putrajaya.

Sulzer emphasised that the partnership will prioritise two critical enablers for the project’s success—ensuring a steady supply of suitable feedstock and securing SAF offtake agreements before the launch of the plant.

“This initiative reflects Sarawak’s intent to contribute meaningfully to global aviation decarbonisation efforts, while building domestic capability in clean fuel manufacturing,” Sulzer stated.

In further support of this initiative, SEDCE has also partnered with Apeiron Bioenergy, Asia’s largest collector of used cooking oil (UCO), to explore and potentially develop a sustainable UCO collection ecosystem in the region.

This aligns with Sarawak’s circular economy and renewable energy goals, transforming waste into low-carbon SAF.

“Apeiron Bioenergy will work with SEDCE to establish UCO logistics, storage, and traceability systems, leveraging its 17 years of experience in biofuel markets to ensure sustainability and compliance throughout the collection network,” said the Singapore-headquartered company, which operates in 10 countries and has supplied over 1 million metric tons of UCO for biofuel production since 2016.

Oiltek Sdn Bhd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore Exchange-listed Oiltek International Limited, is also supporting the SAF programme.

With an extensive portfolio in biodiesel and renewable energy projects—including Sarawak’s 600 MTD integrated biodiesel facility in Bintulu—Oiltek brings proven expertise to the SAF pilot plant’s development.

“In collaboration with SAF technology provider Sulzer, we are confident in our ability to make this showcase SAF plant a flagship success in Sarawak,” said Oiltek.

Oiltek, established in 1980, has delivered over 16 biodiesel plants and more than 20 methane biogas capture facilities across 38 countries. It also built a crude POME oil treatment plant in Sarawak that supplies high-quality feedstock to HVO producers in Singapore and Europe.

SEDC Energy chief executive officer (CEO) Robert Hardin highlighted that SAF production requires hydrogen via the hydrogenation process to remove oxygen from feedstocks and convert them into jet fuel.

“Hydrogen is needed in removing oxygen from the feedstock, which will then convert this into jet fuel or in this case, SAF,” he said, noting that the pilot plant complements Sarawak’s broader hydrogen value chain ambitions.

This SAF pilot plant initiative comes amid the global aviation industry’s transition toward low-carbon fuels, driven by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

The scheme, which becomes mandatory in 2027, targets 85 per cent coverage of international aviation CO₂ emissions through the participation of major economies such as China, India, and Brazil.

As Sarawak advances its aspiration to become a regional energy hub, the SAF pilot plant project is seen as a strategic step to anchor its presence in the global clean energy value chain and support the aviation sector’s climate goals. — DayakDaily",https://i0.wp.com/dayakdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SAF-PIC-1.jpeg?fit=800%2C548&ssl=1,N,,2025-07-02 12:24:15.689527

Million Air Albany received its first sustainable aviation fuel delivery on June 18 at Albany International Airport.

The Avfuel-branded fixed-base operator partnered with the Albany County Airport Authority to establish consistent fuel supply for operators seeking to reduce emissions.

The fuel blend contains 30% sustainable aviation fuel mixed with 70% traditional jet fuel. According to Avfuel, this blend provides a 24% reduction in carbon emissions over the fuel’s lifecycle compared to petroleum-based jet fuel.

“Sustainable aviation fuel is the most effective tool we have today to reduce the aviation industry’s carbon footprint,” said Brian King, general manager of Million Air Albany. “This initiative has been four years in the making.”

Sam Fresina, chair of the Albany County Airport Authority, said the milestone reflects the airport’s commitment to environmental technologies. “This represents an exciting business opportunity for Albany International Airport, strengthening our position as an innovative transportation hub,” Fresina said.

The sustainable aviation fuel comes from renewable waste materials including used cooking oil. The fuel meets ASTM D1655 specifications and requires no modifications to aircraft or fuel infrastructure.

Joel Hirst, senior vice president of sales at Avfuel, noted the partnership began six months ago when Albany selected Avfuel as its fuel supply partner. The sustainable fuel option expands the existing relationship between the companies.

The initiative forms part of Million Air’s Beyond Green sustainability program covering renewable energy investments and facility efficiency improvements. According to Million Air, neat sustainable aviation fuel can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

The aviation industry is entering a crucial phase in its journey towards climate neutrality. The recent announcement from the International Air Transport Association about the anticipated doubling of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in 2025 is more than a statistical update—it is a signal. While the projected 2 million tonnes of SAF may represent just 0.7 percent of the sector’s total fuel demand, the increase is noteworthy given the slow pace of progress in the last few years.

This milestone, however modest it may appear, holds layered insights into how the ecosystem around aviation is recalibrating. It hints at both momentum and the mountain that remains to be climbed.

Reading the Signals Beyond the Headline

A surface-level reading might focus on how 2 million tonnes of SAF still leave the industry far from its net-zero 2050 target. But a deeper reflection reveals more compelling subtleties:

SAF production is finally moving from pilot scale to commercial relevance: Scaling production even this far is complex, given the regulatory, logistical, and technological challenges in turning waste oils and biomass into reliable jet fuel.

Cost pressure is now a tangible lever for acceleration: The projected $4.4 billion increase in the global fuel bill is steep, but it may also serve as a forcing function. When inefficiencies become expensive, market forces tend to respond faster.

Alignment gaps are clearer than ever: The divergence between energy producers, aircraft manufacturers, and airlines over timelines and deliverables is now in sharper focus, paving the way for strategic interventions and smarter integration.

These insights are vital for industry stakeholders who seek not just to observe sustainability transitions—but to influence them.

The Economic Reality Check

Director General Willie Walsh’s statement underscores a key economic reality. While SAF offers a pathway toward lower lifecycle emissions, its cost relative to conventional jet fuel remains prohibitive. This discrepancy underscores a deeper structural issue: sustainable alternatives are not yet operating on a level economic playing field.

In such contexts, operational strategy becomes just as important as technological innovation. Airlines are already pointing toward delays in more fuel-efficient aircraft deliveries as part of their broader frustration. This underlines the fact that even incremental SAF adoption can become unsustainable unless the upstream and downstream systems evolve in sync.

Converting Struggles Into Strategic Leverage

Challenges around SAF availability and affordability are not mere roadblocks—they are leverage points. By exposing the friction points between ambition and execution, the industry is creating an urgent space for collaborative solutions.

This is precisely where strategic sustainability guidance becomes essential. With multiple moving parts—from biofuel supply chains to certification standards to cross-border emissions regulations—the aviation sector needs more than ambition; it needs interpreters, connectors, and accelerators. Those who can help decode complexity and integrate fragmented efforts will hold the key to unlocking real progress.

A Systems View of Transition

The SAF story is not isolated. It is nested within a larger shift toward circularity, resilience, and environmental accountability across transport systems. The aviation industry’s move towards SAF is a litmus test for how fast other high-emission transport sub-sectors—like maritime and road freight—can mobilize their decarbonization pathways.

As aviation grapples with the difficult trade-offs of green fuel adoption, a broader systems-thinking approach is emerging. The goal is not just to meet targets but to realign entire operational paradigms around sustainability metrics.

What Comes Next Is Pivotal

The doubling of SAF production in 2025 may only mark a beginning, but it is a milestone worthy of strategic reflection. With net-zero 2050 on the horizon, the actions taken in this current decade will define the feasibility of that long-term goal.

Moving forward, the aviation industry—and the transport sector at large—must focus on three critical shifts:

Aligning incentives: Public and private sectors must co-create viable policy instruments that balance risk, reward, and urgency.

Building trust across stakeholders: Transparent communication between energy providers, aircraft OEMs, and operators is vital to avoid bottlenecks.

Operationalizing sustainability roadmaps: Long-term goals must be broken down into achievable short-term actions that are measurable and iterative.

Conclusion: Optimism Rooted in Realism

The International Air Transport Association’s forecast may not deliver headline-grabbing figures, but it does deliver something more enduring—momentum grounded in realism. This is the kind of momentum that invites proactive shaping, not passive waiting.

As the aviation sector takes tentative but necessary steps toward SAF adoption, there is a clear call for strategic engagement across the ecosystem.

US Senate votes to soften clean energy tax cuts: Update

Adds details throughout Washington, 1 July (Argus) — The US Senate is giving wind and solar projects slightly more time to qualify for subsidies, as part of a budget bill Republicans passed today that would repeal most of the clean energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act while expanding oil and gas leasing. An updated version of the bill , released shortly before it was passed Tuesday by the Senate in a 51-50 vote, would allow wind and solar projects to continue to qualify for clean electricity tax credits so long as they commence construction within 12 months of the bill's enactment. Republican leaders also dropped a first-time excise tax on wind and solar projects they added to the bill just days ago, as they worked to shore up support from US senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and other moderates that had balked at a more aggressive tax credit phase-out schedule. The Senate-passed bill would still zero out tax credits for wind and solar projects that are not placed into service before the end of 2027 — in line with a draft of the bill released on 28 June — but developers that start construction within 12 months can still qualify for tax credits worth up to 30pc of a project's cost or up to $15/MWh. Renewable energy officials saw that change as an improvement over the initial draft, which could have ended credits for projects already under development. Business Council for Sustainable Energy president Lynn Abramson said the legislation still represents a ""significant step backward"" for the industry. The bill, which passed with US vice president JD Vance casting a tie-breaking vote, will now advance to the US House of Representatives for a final vote as soon as Wednesday. House speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) said the chamber will ""work quickly"" to pass the bill, although doing so will require near-unanimous support from House Republicans, some of whom have bristled at changes the Senate made to the bill. President Donald Trump said today he wants a final vote by 4 July and urged House Republicans to ignore ""its occasional 'GRANDSTANDERS'"" that have previously held up his legislative agenda. The Senate bill is expected to cut about $560bn of clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, according to estimates based on the 28 June version of the bill. But those savings will be dwarfed by other spending in the bill and additional tax cuts that, if enacted, are expected to add nearly $3.3 trillion to the debt over the next decade, the US Congressional Budget Office said. The bill would repeal a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles purchased after 30 September and zero out all penalties against automakers that fail to meet fuel-economy standards, undermining incentives for automakers to sell electric and hybrid vehicles. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, who earlier this year worked alongside Trump on a cost-cutting ""DOGE"" project, said the bill would destroy millions of jobs. ""Utterly insane and destructive,"" Musk said in a social media post on 28 June. ""It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future."" The Senate softened some of the tax credit cuts the House voted for in May. Clean hydrogen projects would need to start construction by 1 January 2028 to qualify for a tax credit of up to $3/kg, rather than facing a House deadline at the end of 2025. In another change, the bill extends a tax credit for biofuels by two years, until 2029, rather than a four-year extension the Senate initially proposed. The bill would expand federal oil and gas leasing by mandating twice yearly lease sales in the US Gulf of Mexico and regular onshore leases, in addition to slashing royalty rates to the lowest levels in nearly two decades. The bill would also indefinitely delay the collection of a $900/metric tonne fee on methane leaks and reinstate a federal tax deduction for ""intangible"" drilling costs. Another program would provide $171mn to buy crude to refill the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a fraction of the $1.3bn fund that was passed by the House. Republicans initially sought to overhaul permitting through the bill, but the only program that is eligible for the filibuster-proof process used for the bill would allow industry to pay a fee to fast-track environmental reviews. The bill would also cut royalties on coal mined on federal land, provide a tax credit for metallurgical coal, repeal climate-related grant programs from the Inflation Reduction Act, and permanently extend some business tax breaks.

US Senate votes to pass tax, energy bill

Washington, 1 July (Argus) — The Republican-led US Senate narrowly passed a more than $3 trillion bill today that would expand oil and gas leasing, weaken fuel-economy rules, and phase out many of the clean energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act. The Senate voted 51-50 to pass a revised version of the massive budget bill, with US vice president JD Vance casting a tie-breaking vote. US senators Rand Paul (R-Kentucky), Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) joined Democrats in voting against the bill, which will now advance to the US House of Representatives for a potential final vote by the end of the week. ""The House will work quickly to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill that enacts President Trump's full America First agenda by the Fourth of July,"" House speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) said. President Donald Trump has pushed for the enactment of the bill the Independence Day holiday, but suggested today that his non-binding deadline may slip. ""I'd love to do July 4th, but I think it's very hard to do July 4"", he said. Among the difficulties is a House rule meant to provide at least 72 hours to review a bill before starting debate, in addition to a razor-thin Republican majority in the House that could make it challenging for the bill to pass. The Senate bill is expected to save about $560bn over a decade by ending many of the clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, but other tax cuts and policies in the bill are expected add more than $3 trillion to the deficit, according to estimates the non-partisan US Joint Committee on Taxation conducted on the bill as drafted on 28 June. The bill would repeal a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles purchased after 30 September and zero out all penalties against automakers that fail to meet fuel-economy standards. The bill would also end tax credits for wind and solar projects that fail to start operations by 2027.

But the Senate bill softened some of the energy tax credit cuts the House voted to pass in May. Clean hydrogen projects would need to start construction by 1 January 2028 to qualify for a tax credit of up to $3/kg that developers say is critical for the industry's growth, rather than facing a House deadline at the end of 2025. In another recent change, the Senate bill is seeking a two-year extension of a biofuels tax break until 2029, rather than a four-year extension the Senate initially proposed.

Philippines’ ethanol imports to increase: USDA

Singapore, 1 July (Argus) — The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) expects the Philippines' fuel ethanol market and imports to grow in 2025, but the country's biodiesel outlook remains unclear. The Philippines' fuel ethanol consumption is expected to increase from 797mn litres in 2024 to 840mn l this year, rising in tandem with the USDA's gasoline consumption growth forecast of 5pc for 2025. The Philippines has a 10pc ethanol blending mandate for road fuel, tying ethanol demand to gasoline consumption. Car purchases rose by 9pc in 2024, the USDA said, while investments in the country's public transportation system have yet to yield results. Reflecting the forecast increase in road fuel consumption, the USDA is predicting that fuel-grade ethanol imports will rise by 10pc to 450mnl in 2025. The relatively steep growth in imported fuel-grade ethanol is the result of limited ethanol feedstock in the country, it said. The Philippines prioritises the use of domestic ethanol in road fuel blending. Fuel suppliers can only import ethanol at times of domestic shortages. Domestic ethanol is produced from sugarcane and molasses, but a recent decline in available sugarcane land has supported sugarcane and molasses prices, pushing up the cost of ethanol. This has resulted in a slowdown in ethanol production growth because of narrower margins. The USDA expects domestic ethanol production to increase at a relatively low rate of 2pc on the year in 2025 because of the feedstock limitations. Sugarcane- and molasses-based ethanol have one of the highest greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction rates among commonly used first-generation or crop-based ethanol feedstocks such as corn. The Philippines' mandate does not stipulate a definite GHG reduction requirement, leading to imports of predominately US corn-based ethanol, which is the most competitively priced in the market. The affordability of US corn-based ethanol encourages a higher blend of ethanol in road fuel. The Philippines approved a voluntary E20 programme in June 2024 and the USDA expects to see higher uptake of this blend in the coming year. Biodiesel The USDA is forecasting that the Philippines' biodiesel production will hit 360mn l in 2025 should the country remain at B3. But it may increase by 50pc from 2024 to 400mn l this year should the B4 mandate be implemented. The progress of the country's B4 programme remains uncertain after members of the national biofuel board (NBB) agreed on 29 May to pass a resolution to suspend the B4 and B5 implementation in 2025 and 2026 respectively. The board cited the relatively high price of seaborne coconut oil as a reason to recalibrate the programme. The Philippines uses domestic coconut oil in its biodiesel production, but coconut oil prices have more than doubled from $1,100/t in 2024 to around $3,000/t in 2025, resulting in a halt to reconsider market economics. The country's energy department has yet to issue an official advisory on the suspension of the B4 programme, leaving the market in limbo. Sustainable aviation fuel The Philippines has yet to publish a roadmap for its SAF mandate but has formed a SAF committee under the NBB. The country's flag carrier Philippine Airlines announced a 1pc SAF target for 2026. Another local airline, Cebu Pacific, has started using SAF and signed an agreement with Finish SAF producer Neste in 2023. The Philippines has yet to produce SAF but is evaluating the situation and considering the feasibility of different pathways.

Australia’s NSW to propose new net zero plan in FY26

Sydney, 1 July (Argus) — Australia's New South Wales (NSW) plans to announce a new net zero plan in the July 2025-June 2026 financial year to reach the state's existing 2030 and 2035 emissions reduction targets. This comes on the back of concerns on ongoing progress raised by the Net Zero Commission. The new plan will be developed over the next 12 months, a spokesperson from the NSW Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Waster (DCCEEW) told Argus . The plan will include all sectors but will prioritise transport and built environments. NSW's total emissions decreased by only 27pc over 2005-22, according to the Net Zero Commission 2024 annual report released in November 2024. This has been followed by a parliamentary inquiry report released in March 2025. NSW is targeting to cut emissions by 50pc from 2005 levels by 2030 and by 70pc by 2035 , but meeting these targets is not guaranteed and NSW will need to increase and accelerate its efforts to remain on track, the reports said. The new net zero plan is part of a government response to the annual report as well as the parliamentary inquiry report by the Joint Standing Committee on Net Zero Future. NSW also introduced its Energy Security Corporation (ESC), which became fully operational on 1 July, to support decarbonising the state's electricity grid. The ESC is a government-backed investor with A$1bn ($660mn) of seed funding to invest in renewable electricity, large-scale storage and power networks, according to a joint ministerial media release on 1 July. There has been criticism from the energy industry about the lack of a viable transition from coal-fired power to renewable energy, according to the National Electricity Market review . The Net Zero Commission is ""concerned about the risks to the state's targets"" that the resources sector poses. The government is establishing a regional monitoring network for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in response to the commission's concerns. NSW is also reviewing its position on coal mining exploration. The state will reach a 46pc reduction of emissions by 2030 and 62pc by 2035 if it continues to comply with the first stage of its net zero plans, according to the Central Resources of Sharing and Enabling Environmental Data NSW's Net Zero emissions dashboard. The role of biofuels is not specifically outlined but will be part of a Renewable Fuel Strategy to be published in mid-2025, according to the NSW government. The Net Zero Commission expects the transport sector to be the largest emitting sector by 2030.

As one of the leading enterprises in the aviation-logistics sector, Vietnam Airlines has pursued a sustainable development strategy over the years. The airline focuses on reducing emissions, modernising its fleet, improving operational processes, and optimising resource use.

It also uses sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), implementing a carbon control system and investing in a new generation of fuel-efficient fleets.

On May 27, 2024, Vietnam Airlines operated the first commercial flight using SAF from Singapore to Hanoi. Continuing this success, on June 5, on the occasion of World Environment Day, the airline simultaneously operated six domestic flights using SAF.

This is the first time in Vietnam that SAF has been applied simultaneously on both international and domestic flight networks, marking the transition from pilot to practice in sustainable aviation operations.

In addition to focusing on environmental factors, Vietnam Airlines also actively integrates social and governance criteria into all its activities. The airline maintains a policy of remuneration and career development for employees, enhances internal training, promotes gender equality, and ensures the rights of diverse labour groups.

For social responsibility programmes, from community support to blood donations and relief activities, the carrier has maintained its commitment to the community. One of these activities was ""Dream Trip 2025"", which brought memorable experiences to 80 children living in special circumstances in Danang. Dream Trip is a volunteer activity, and a spiritual bridge between the enterprise and the community, inspiring a desire to change the lives of those less fortunate.

To protect the environment and restore the ecosystem, Vietnam Airlines and MoMo launched a forest protection campaign in June 2024. The campaign focuses on restoring 50 hectares of forest in the northwest region to prevent degradation and protect natural resources for future generations.

With drones and air taxis likely to become a prominent feature of our future skies, drone traffic management will be a growing issue.

To avoid drone-on-drone collisions, US research university Virginia Tech has formed the Virginia Tech Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership (MAAP), supported by Nasa and the FAA.

MAAP has created a drone traffic management system that enables governments and industry to share data about their flight operations. The aim is that this information will help deconflict drone flights quickly and safely.

John Coggin, MAAP’s associate director, said: “This is a culmination of 10 years of work. The product of this work is that the industry now has a path forward for data-sharing among uncrewed aircraft systems operators, which helps mitigate collision risk between drones.

“Advanced and overlapping drone operations require that companies share data to ensure safety. The industry-governed framework established here helps meet these safety goals and provides a template to scale drone traffic management services in the US and worldwide.”

The traffic management system was put to the test in a real-world scenario for the first time in North Texas during March.

This led to the FAA granting authorisation of drone flights to share the airspace, despite significant operator demand and overlapping drone flight paths.

Chris Rocheleau, FAA administrator, said: “It was a historic first for US aviation. Now we want to move from one-off approvals or exemptions to the predictability of operating by rule for beyond visual line of sight, or BVLOS.

“And when finalised, this rule will provide the UAS [unmanned aircraft system] industry with the regulatory framework it needs.”

MAAP is urging drone operators to undergo an onboarding process to enable them to use this traffic management system framework.

Robert Briggs, MAAP’s chief engineer, said: “Unlike previous efforts I’ve been involved in, it’s not a ‘here is your final report’ and the project is done.

“Here, the traffic management systems are operational and can continue to grow and be used as a model for future implementation around the world.”",https://cdn2.eandtmagazine.org/sites/default/files/styles/uncropped_small/public/2025-07/web_two-drone-quad-copters-high-resolution_Credit_Goinyk-Production_shutterstock_636131741_1600x900%20%281%29.jpg?itok=UsE-8khD,N,,2025-07-02 05:01:19.195835

July 01, 2025 - The growing volume of global air travel and the increasing push for decarbonization in aviation are major factors driving revenue growth in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) market. Airports Council International (ACI) World forecasts that global passenger traffic will surpass pre-pandemic levels by 2024, reaching 9.5 billion, and is projected to exceed 12 billion by 2030, driven largely by expanding markets in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. Additionally, data from the European Union shows that 973 million people traveled by air within the EU in 2023. Spain recorded the highest number of passengers at 110.9 million, while Malta experienced the largest year-over-year growth, rising 31.8% to 5.7 million.

On June 2025, Axens, in partnership with IFP Energies nouvelles (IFPEN) and SMS group, has successfully certified the Carboverseo technology. This cutting-edge reverse water-gas shift process, which transforms CO₂ into CO, is now operational and poised to reshape the e-fuel sector by offering a reliable and scalable method for converting CO₂ into valuable outputs. The development of Carboverseo was accelerated through a fast-track approach, capitalizing on the combined expertise of all partners. Axens played a key role by contributing its process design and integration know-how, built on its extensive background in the oil and gas industry.

One of the primary obstacles to the adoption of sustainable aviation fuels is their high cost. At present, biofuel-based SAF is priced at two to three times the cost of conventional jet fuel, while eSAF can be six to eight times more expensive. The aviation sector faces intense competition, operates on narrow profit margins, and bears high liability due to strict safety regulations—factors that make integrating these costly alternatives particularly challenging.

At the core of this transformation are federal incentives that signaled a new era of American industrial and energy policy, which the private sector has responded to with a surge of investments across the U.S. These incentives, in the form of tax credits, grants, and loans, seek to position the United States as the global leader in next-generation energy technologies such as advanced renewables, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, advanced nuclear, and enhanced geothermal. Many clean energy related investments are only beginning to materialize into shovels in the ground, but in just under three years since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that created or expanded these energy tax incentives, almost every community in the United States has been impacted by new investment, production, and development.

The future of clean energy tax credits, and broader U.S. energy deployment, hangs in the balance, as the 119th Congress considers rolling back federal support. Recent analysis by Brattle, Energy Innovation, and Rhodium Group find that repealing energy tax credits would have significant consequences for energy costs for both households and manufacturers, eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs, stifle U.S. industrial competitiveness, and reduce economic growth and GDP.

CATF takes a deeper look into the geography of federal clean energy tax credits to provide a snapshot of where and how these credits are shaping local economies across the United States.

The analysis below indicates that such rollbacks would have disproportionate effects on specific regions of the country, with outsized impacts in Southern and Western states; Republican districts; and historic manufacturing and industrial communities that have been reinvigorated by these investments.

Southern and Western states benefit significantly from clean energy investments

Figure 1. Total reported investments per capita for manufacturing, utility electricity, and industrial facilities under construction or completed between Q2 2022 and Q1 2025 (post-IRA).

From the second half of 2022 through the first quarter of 2025:

Over $321 billion was invested in manufacturing, electricity, and industry projects across the United States, with over 2,000 facilities breaking ground during this period.1

In aggregate, Texas and California have seen the most clean energy related investments, totaling $62.3 billion and $34 billion, respectively, between 2022 and the first quarter of 2025.

Texas has leveraged its diverse energy portfolio and streamlined permitting and approval processes to activate a slew of energy projects across technologies, while California has taken advantage of federal incentives to drive investments towards the state’s evolving energy system.

While Texas and California are the clear winners in the aggregate, analysis on a per capita basis2 reveal that clean energy investments have also significantly benefited other Western and Southern states:

Nevadans on average have received $3,605 from clean energy investments

New Mexicans have gained about $2,095 from clean energy investments

Wyoming registers the highest per capita benefit from clean energy investments at over $6,800

For comparison, the per capita benefits in Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York are all below $1,000.

Texas, the largest energy consuming state and largest net supplier of energy to other states, has seen over $60 billion in investments on solar, wind, batteries, storage, critical minerals, carbon capture, hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel, and carbon removal projects across power, manufacturing, transport, and industry sectors. There are currently 130 of these projects under construction and 234 projects in operation, which are already expanding local and nationwide industry capabilities while creating and sustaining thousands of construction, manufacturing, and installation jobs across the state. This surge of investments is only fraction of what Texas should expect to see – the state still has an estimated $128.5 billion in outstanding investments for 250+ more announced projects.

Texas is one of many states with significant project investments in the pipeline. Projections show significant tax credit-induced investments are still outstanding for a number of states like Louisiana, North Dakota, Washington, Virginia, and Oregon. For example, Louisiana has seen $2.8 billion invested in the state since the second half of 2022, only 7% of the total expected project investments to come to the state. North Dakota, Washington, Virginia, and Oregon have yet to receive more than 50% of their expected investments as well.

Job creation spurred by clean energy investments are concentrated in Republican districts

Figure 2. Cumulative job potential by congressional district, including construction and operational jobs, generated by clean energy tax credits (post-IRA).

As firms take advantage of federal incentives to expand existing facilities, initiate greenfield projects, or invest in new production capacity and supply chains, communities are seeing broader opportunities for jobs in the energy sector. The map above shows cumulative job potential by congressional district, including construction and operational jobs, based on announced or completed projects that have been supported by clean energy incentives.

As others have noted, most clean energy projects are landing in Republican-held districts and they stand to lose the most if these incentives are rolled back. In fact, CATF finds that, on average, for every job generated in a Democratic district, three jobs are generated in a Republican district.

Moreover, nine of the top ten districts expected to gain the most jobs are currently held by Republicans:

This includes Nevada’s second congressional district (NV-02), where major investments include Lithium America’s Thacker Pass mine, which is expected to produce enough battery-quality lithium carbonate per year to power 800,000 electric vehicles. The project recently reached a key development milestone and could provide almost 2,000 jobs from an agreement between Bechtel and North America’s Building Trades Unions to establish a local apprenticeship program.

Other districts at risk of unrealized job gains include Texas’ nineteenth congressional district (TX-19), Arizona’s ninth congressional district (AZ-09), and Tennessee’s eighth congressional district (TN-08), where cumulative job impacts from clean energy investments are expected to be over 10,000 each.

These districts, along with many others across the country, are benefiting from tangible growth and economic gains associated with new projects, from increased local tax revenue to thousands of new construction, manufacturing, and operations jobs.

Historic manufacturing and industrial corridors are benefiting alongside emerging clusters

Figure 3. Density heat map of facility-level investments across the U.S., weighted by size of capital expenditures, from Q2 2022-Q12025 (post-IRA).

Energy and Industry

Manufacturing

Lastly, there appears to be an emerging geographic pattern in the type of clean energy projects that are flowing into communities, supporting existing industrial, manufacturing, and energy corridors as well as catalyzing new hubs. The heat maps above show the regional concentration of facility-level investments as of the first quarter of 2025, weighted by the size of investments. This allows for assessing the spatial concentration of actual investment dollars.

CATF finds significant energy and industry-related investments in the Gulf Coast, Southern Louisiana, the Texas Triangle, and established corridors for energy-related sectors. Energy and industry-related investments are also flowing into emerging hubs such as Southern Arizona, which has drawn investments in solar, batteries, critical minerals and hydrogen. Major investments include America Battery Factory’s $1.2 billion production facility in Tuscon and Fortescue’s $550 million green hydrogen project in Buckeye, which is now at risk as the future hydrogen incentives remain uncertain.

Manufacturing investments, meanwhile, have concentrated in the Midwest and emerging manufacturing clusters in the Southeast, notably Northern Georgia and North Carolina. For example, Toyota’s nearly $14 billion investment in EV production in Liberty, North Carolina is among the largest clean energy investments in the country, and the facility is expected to continue to ramp up production capacity through 2030.

Clean energy manufacturing has evolved from a niche subsegment to a powerhouse industry and is forecast to contribute $86 billion to the country’s GDP by 2030. Curtailing federal support for crucial incentives would jeopardize much of this progress.

These projects depend on sustained federal incentives, including grants and tax credits. But there is still a large percentage of investment outstanding, putting these projects – and the economic and public health benefits they create – at risk if clean energy provisions are diminished or eliminated.

Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, has rapidly ascended to the forefront of climate discourse within the aviation industry. Its promise lies in its capacity to drastically cut lifecycle emissions from aircraft operations, without demanding radical changes to existing infrastructure or aircraft technology. As airlines, governments and industry stakeholders work toward ambitious net-zero targets, SAF has emerged as a central enabler, projected to contribute more than 60 percent of aviation’s carbon reduction pathway.

Yet, despite its promise, SAF today accounts for less than one percent of total jet fuel usage. With global demand expected to soar, production capabilities remain well below target. Over 300 renewable fuel projects have been announced globally, but only a fraction are poised to reach operational status by the end of this decade.

This mismatch between ambition and reality presents both a challenge and a window of strategic opportunity—particularly for countries willing to position themselves early in the SAF value chain.

India’s Natural Advantage: Feedstock and Policy Potential

India is uniquely equipped to seize this opportunity. The country enjoys abundant feedstock availability—from agricultural residues to used cooking oil—and a robust biochemical and refining ecosystem. Moreover, its diverse geography, growing domestic demand, and well-established research institutions offer a fertile ground for innovation and scalable production.

However, natural advantages alone are not enough. The global SAF race is a policy-led movement. Regions like the United States and European Union have advanced production thanks largely to consistent incentives, mandates, and long-term regulatory clarity. In contrast, countries still in the policy formulation phase risk falling behind, despite their resource potential.

India has the tools to lead, but a decisive policy shift is required. Strong and targeted incentives for producers, guaranteed offtake frameworks, and investment in certification infrastructure can propel the ecosystem forward.

Learning from the World: Incentives Over Mandates

A key insight emerging from global SAF development is the effectiveness of incentives over mandates. While mandates offer a clear signal to industry, they risk creating demand without sufficient supply, driving up costs and discouraging investment. In contrast, incentive-based models—such as the United States’ Inflation Reduction Act—have proven more conducive to scaling production.

India, at its current stage of SAF evolution, stands to benefit from an incentive-first approach. Tailored fiscal instruments, such as tax credits, production-linked subsidies, or SAF-specific viability gap funding, could dramatically alter the risk-reward calculus for producers and investors.

Equally important is fostering regional collaboration and knowledge exchange. By learning from jurisdictions that have successfully implemented SAF policy frameworks, India can avoid pitfalls and accelerate implementation.

Infrastructure, Timelines, and Market Readiness

Even with policy support, SAF production remains a long-lead endeavor. Most commercial-scale biorefineries take four to five years from concept to commissioning. That timeline poses a critical planning challenge. If India aims to be a global SAF supplier by 2030, groundwork must begin now.

Beyond production facilities, attention must be paid to supply chain readiness. This includes storage, blending infrastructure, logistics integration at airports, and robust sustainability verification mechanisms.

The private sector, public institutions, and academia must collaborate to build a future-ready SAF ecosystem that integrates feedstock innovation, process optimization, and lifecycle carbon accounting.

The Larger Narrative: India’s Role in the Global Net-Zero Transition

By embracing SAF leadership, India does more than secure a share in a burgeoning industry. It reinforces its standing as a climate-responsible nation and a solution provider for the global South. The country can offer scalable, cost-effective SAF solutions that serve both domestic needs and international carriers seeking lower-emission fuel alternatives.

The move would also align with broader national goals—boosting rural employment, supporting agricultural waste valorization, enhancing energy security, and contributing to Make in India and green industrialisation objectives.

Conclusion: A Strategic Call for Early Action

India’s moment to act is now. With the world still early in its SAF journey, there is space for new leaders to emerge. By crafting an ambitious, yet pragmatic policy framework anchored in incentives, India can unlock significant socio-economic and environmental value.

The window of opportunity may be brief. If India is to move from potential to position—from feedstock-rich to future-ready—then clarity, coordination, and conviction will be key. The path is clear, the world is watching, and the time to lead is here.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-62.svg,N,,2025-07-02 07:05:06.122990

The airline has officially announced the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) on its commercial flights, reinforcing Thailand’s green aviation industry and laying a crucial foundation for environmentally balanced aviation development in the future.

The initiative took effect on 1 July 2025.

Bangkok Airways Public Company Limited President Captain Puttipong Prasarttong-Osoth commented at the launch: “The official use of SAF on commercial flights marks a significant milestone in the airline’s transition toward a more environmentally friendly aviation future.

“This initiative aligns with the goal of achieving Net Zero Carbon Emissions, which lies at the heart of sustainability policies in the aviation sector. In 2024, the airline began using SAF on a pilot flight operating between Samui and Bangkok. This time, SAF will be used on commercial flights departing from Bangkok (Suvarnabhumi Airport) to international destinations, including Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Luang Prabang, and the Maldives.”

Bangkok Airways will begin using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blended at 1% with 99% Jet A-1 fuel, which can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 128 kilogrammes of CO₂ per flight.

Bangkok Airways is committed to evolving into a truly “Sustainable Airline,” guided by the ESG framework, which is integrated across all aspects of its operations.

The airline upholds responsibility in three aspects: Environmental, Social, and Governance. In terms of environmental responsibility, Bangkok Airways focuses on climate change management, waste management, efficient use of resources, and the adoption of alternative energy sources. It continues to explore comprehensive measures to improve fuel efficiency, conduct corporate carbon footprint reporting, expand waste separation bins, and promote the upcycling of operational waste into products that benefit both society and the environment.

What we've learned from the GoGreen Plus journey The demand is real: People expect emissions-reduced logistics.","As businesses face growing pressure to decarbonize, logistics is a critical lever for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. DHL’s innovative GoGreen Plus empowers companies to harness this lever to help meet their decarbonization targets and future-proof their supply chains.

Transport accounts for more than a third of CO₂ emissions from end-use sectors, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). After a temporary dip during the COVID-19 pandemic, transport emissions are on the rise again. To stay on course for net-zero emissions by 2050, the IEA says CO₂ output from transport must fall by more than 3% per year through 2030.

Where there's a will, there's a way – and businesses across all sectors have made sustainability a top priority. According to a recent DHL survey, nearly 80% surveyed air traders committed to reducing carbon emissions, reflecting a growing trend of environmental responsibility within the industry.

But decarbonizing transport is complex. Companies need solutions that are not only effective but also transparent, scalable, and tailored to their specific business needs.

Making sustainable logistics simple, scalable, and measurable

To help businesses take climate action where it counts, we launched GoGreen Plus – a growing portfolio of sustainable logistics services designed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our customers’ supply chains. Rather than relying on offsetting, GoGreen Plus focuses on true value chain decarbonization, using Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) to reduce actual emissions within the logistics value chain.

How does it work?

GoGreen Plus uses a straightforward ""book and claim"" approach. When you opt in, we replace fossil fuels with low- or zero-emission alternatives across our logistics network. We book the sustainable aviation fuel. You claim the reduced emissions – even if your shipments are not physically transported by a vehicle using those fuels. This is called carbon insetting. Rather than offsetting (e.g., investing in renewable energy like wind farms), we use sustainable fuel (either directly or via partners), reducing the overall emissions of our services and the transport sector as a whole.

How do you measure success?

With our own GHG emissions reduction targets aligned with the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) – and SBTi monitoring our progress – measurability is a top priority. That's why robust reporting standards are built into GoGreen Plus. Emissions reductions are calculated at regular intervals, verified by independent auditors, and documented in externally verified certificates for transparency and reporting.

From ambition to action – the results are clear

Since we launched GoGreen Plus, the response has been overwhelmingly positive, and we've continually expanded our sustainable logistics solutions ever since. As demand has grown, we have proactively worked to increase our use of sustainable fuels. For example, we have formed numerous partnerships to drive up the production of SAF.

What we've learned from the GoGreen Plus journey

The demand is real: People expect emissions-reduced logistics.

Partnerships are key: The supply of SAF remains limited, but our progress shows the power of working with the right partners.

Anything's possible: With the right technologies and partners, we can decarbonize logistics – even at scale.

One size doesn't fit all: Sustainability solutions must be flexible and adapt to each business model.

Transparency builds trust: Verified data and credible reporting are essential to make decarbonization efforts measurable and meaningful.

The company is upgrading its supply chain on every level, from cocoa origin countries in West Africa to processing hubs in Europe.

The plans include measures to reduce carbon emissions, eliminate waste and boost efficiency throughout the chain.

Small changes, big impact

Founded in 1865 as a single grain warehouse, Cargill has grown into a global partner, operating in 70 countries with more than 160,000 employees worldwide.

It partners with farmers and customers to source, make and deliver products to customers, all while ensuring responsible and sustainable practices.

To cut waste, Cargill is making small changes that make big impacts throughout the entire chain. In Côte d’Ivoire, it's turning waste into energy by using once-discarded cocoa shells to fuel biomass boilers.

In Tema, production is powered by a solar plant, and disposable packaging is being replaced by new ISO tanks to transport cocoa butter. This alone means up to 100 tonnes of waste can be cut each month.

“Sustainability isn’t a single project at Cargill—it’s how we operate,” comments Emiel van Dijk, Managing Director of Cocoa & Chocolate Europe and West Africa. “From circular waste reuse to renewable transport and clean energy, we’re showing that climate action can scale, without compromise.”

Sustainability is built into every step of the production process, ensuring strong and lasting chains. From the warehouse to the final delivery, every step is examined and Cargill considers how it can reduce its negative impact.

Beans are stored in solar-powered warehouses near Amsterdam before transportation via fully-electric barges to Zaandam - cutting 190,000kg of CO2 emissions annually.

Cocoa shells are reused as fuel in Cargill’s biomass boiler in Amsterdam, reducing GHGs by almost 19,000 tonnes every year.

On the Amsterdam warehouses, Marijn Moesbergen, Cocoa Sourcing Director, says: “This location allows us to operate at scale while reducing our environmental footprint.

“By investing in infrastructure like this, we improve logistics efficiency, reduce emissions and ensure that cocoa arrives safely and responsibly at the heart of the European supply chain.”

The wider goal

Low-emission transport plays a big role in the final step of the production journey. The semi-finished products are shipped using BIO LNG trucks (heavy-duty vehicles using fuel produced from organic waste materials) to another warehouse in Zaandam.

This warehouse uses solar panels, automated vehicles and intermodal rail and barge connections, reducing last-mile impact.

Products are then delivered across Europe using renewable fuels and short sea shipping, which factors into Cargill’s global target to reduce supply chain emissions by 30% per ton of product by 2030.

“This is what sustainability at scale looks like,” adds Emiel. “It’s measurable, circular and designed to serve both people and the planet.”

Cargill believes that the success in the cocoa value chain goes hand in hand with benefits for cocoa farmers, so it works to create a sustainable, lasting supply chain.

Through the Cargill Cocoa Promise, Cargill aims to improve the livelihoods of a million farmers. By providing training in sustainable agriculture practices and access to resources, it will help farmers and their communities, as well as strengthening the cocoa supply chain.

Cargill is also committed to zero deforestation in its direct and indirect cocoa supply chain by 2030, ensuring it maintains supply chain transparency with farmer mapping and bean traceability.

The measures Cargill is taking to have a positive impact on the environment through its cocoa supply chain can be tracked every step of the way, and it looks right on track to meet its 2030 targets.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/13e0613c7c9489d5977f5477be9693a7:4fe59a637369756eac0d79bfe13b1186/pablo-merchan-montes-scbq6ukcymy-unsplash.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-02 05:59:46.723122

The new company aims to produce around 40 million Nm³ (*3) of biogas – equivalent to the annual gas consumption of about 20,000 Danish households. It will also expand SE's existing biogas production sites across Denmark. Further, leveraging knowledge gained from the biogas business, the joint venture will develop other bioenergy sources, including e-SAF, a sustainable aviation fuel. This marks Sumitomo Corporation's first participation in a biogas production business and will accelerate the growth of its energy solutions division, one of the key growth areas in its current Medium-Term Management Plan.

Denmark's Biogas Market

As an agricultural powerhouse, Denmark aims to make full use of organic waste generated through farming while achieving carbon neutrality. The country has set a target to power its national gas grid entirely with biogas by 2030. Biogas – produced from organic waste such as food residue and livestock manure – is attracting increasing attention as a renewable energy source. Because it does not emit CO2 during combustion but instead returns only the CO2 originally absorbed by its raw materials, it contributes to achieving carbon neutrality. In addition, by using domestically sourced raw materials, biogas enhances energy self-sufficiency and drives the development of new production facilities across the country.

Purpose of Establishing the New Company

Since its founding in 1999, SE has developed renewable energy projects such as wind power. Today, it owns facilities for biogas production from cattle manure and land for developing Power to X business such as e-SAF. SE has also built strong partnerships with agricultural cooperative associations in Denmark and has signed a long-term raw materials supply agreement through 2032. This will ensure a stable supply of raw materials for biogas production.

By combining Sumitomo Corporation's business network in Europe with SE's strengths, the new company aims to expand the biogas business and develop e-SAF production. As a synthetic fuel produced from biomass-derived carbon dioxide and green hydrogen, e-SAF is expected to see rising demand as it moves towards commercialization. Denmark generates around 90% of its domestic electricity from renewable sources, giving it an advantage in procuring green hydrogen. By expanding biogas operations across the country, the new company will be able to supply biomass-derived CO2 – an ingredient in e-SAF – stably and at low cost from its own plants.

Sumitomo Corporation Group's Bioenergy Business

The Sumitomo Corporation Group has positioned bioenergy as a key method for achieving carbon neutrality in its business operations by 2050 and realizing a sustainable energy cycle. In addition to promoting the MORISORA Project in Japan under an MoU signed in February 2025 to develop domestically produced SAF, the Group also signed an MoU with reNIKOLA in Malaysia in May 2025 to explore bioenergy development, including projects for producing and selling biomethane in Malaysia and Indonesia.

Houston American Energy Corp. (NYSE American: HUSA) has positioned itself at the forefront of this transformation through its acquisition of Abundia Global Impact Group (AGIG), a move that redefines its identity from a traditional oil and gas player to a leader in advanced recycling and low-carbon fuels. This strategic alignment with the renewable energy transition and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) investment trends could make HUSA a compelling play for investors seeking exposure to the circular economy and decarbonization megatrends.

The Strategic Rationale: From Fossil Fuels to Plastic-to-Fuel Innovation

The acquisition of AGIG represents more than a diversification play—it is a full-scale business transformation. By integrating AGIG's proprietary pyrolysis technology, HUSA gains a scalable solution to convert waste plastics into high-value drop-in fuels, chemicals, and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This shift addresses two critical global challenges: reducing plastic pollution and meeting the surging demand for low-carbon alternatives.

The Gulf Coast facility, central to AGIG's five-year growth plan, leverages the region's petrochemical infrastructure and logistical advantages. With access to abundant waste feedstock and proximity to chemical manufacturers and airlines—key buyers of SAF—the site positions HUSA to capitalize on a multi-billion-dollar market. This strategic geographic choice underscores the company's focus on capital efficiency and supply chain integration.

The ESG Opportunity: Aligning Profit with Purpose

The renewable energy transition is not just about technology—it's about investor sentiment. ESG-focused funds now manage over $40 trillion globally, with a growing emphasis on companies that contribute to circular economies and climate solutions. HUSA's acquisition checks multiple ESG boxes:

Environmental Impact: AGIG's technology diverts plastic waste from landfills and oceans while producing fuels with a fraction of the carbon intensity of traditional oil-based products.

Social Value: The project creates skilled jobs in the Gulf Coast, aligning with regional economic development goals.

Governance: The leadership team, including AGIG founder Ed Gillespie as CEO, brings deep expertise in advanced recycling and project execution—a critical factor for investors wary of greenwashing.

The transaction's structure also reflects ESG priorities: AGIG's 94% stake in HUSA post-acquisition incentivizes alignment between management and shareholders, as success now hinges on executing on the company's sustainability mission.

Risks and Challenges: Execution Will Determine Success

While the strategic vision is compelling, execution risks remain significant. HUSA's transition faces hurdles such as:

- Capital Requirements: Scaling the Gulf Coast facility will demand substantial financing.

- Regulatory Approval: Permits for chemical facilities and SAF production standards must be secured.

- Market Competition: Companies like Chevron and Honeywell are also investing in plastic-to-fuel technologies, raising the stakes for HUSA's cost and efficiency advantages.

Investors should monitor HUSA's liquidity, its ability to secure debt or equity financing, and progress on securing long-term supply agreements with airlines and chemical firms. A delay in facility construction or a drop in SAF pricing could pressure the stock, currently trading near multi-year lows.

Investment Considerations: A High-Reward, High-Risk Bet on Renewables

Extension and modification of small agri-biodiesel producer credit applies to fuel sold or used after June 30, 2025

Carbon Capture 45Q15 Updated standard $17/ton base rate ($36/ton for projects meeting PWA rules) for all uses (i.e., enhanced oil recovery, storage, utilization) starting in 2025 After enactment: taxpayer cannot be a prohibited foreign entity Parity for different uses and updated utilizations of qualified carbon oxide apply to facilities or equipment placed in service after enactment of the bill

Section Penalty Description Penalty Amount Sec. 666216

Substantial understatement of income tax due to disallowance of applicable energy credits:

Stricter penalty threshold when the IRS disallows a taxpayer's claimed energy credit (e.g., 45X, 45Y, or 48E) due to foreign entity restrictions or material assistance violations

A 1% misstatement of the tax liability would trigger a 20% penalty

Applies to credits disallowed due to FEOC or foreign-sourcing restrictions

Sec. 6695B

Substantial misstatements on certifications provided by suppliers:

New proposed penalty that targets suppliers or manufacturers who issue false certifications regarding domestic content or foreign sourcing

Applies to certifications provided after Dec. 31, 2025

Greater of $5,000 or 10% of credit amount claimed by the taxpayer relying on the misstated certification

Observation: Projects seeking tax credits under sections 45 and 48 are generally unaffected by the bill, except as described below with respect to the termination of 2% energy credit. To be eligible for tax credits under sections 45 or 48, a project (except for ground or groundwater thermal systems, as described below) must have begun construction before Jan. 1, 2025, and generally be placed in service within 4 years (or 10 years in the case of offshore wind) after in year in which construction begun.

§168 – Accelerated Cost Recovery System (Depreciation)

Section 45Y and 48E property would continue to be listed as 5-year MACRS property under section 168.

Property that would be ""energy property"" as defined in section 48 would no longer be listed as 5-year MACRS property under Section 168.

Observation: Without a specific indication to the contrary, there are arguments that such property would continue to be subject to the MACRS rules/guidance, which include general rules regarding the determination of MACRS class lives (such as Rev. Proc. 87-56).

Alternatively, taxpayers would appear to be able to elect the alternative depreciation system and apply 12-year, straight-line recovery under section 168(g).

45Y – Clean Electricity Production Credit & §48E – Clean Electricity Investment Credit

Placed in Service Deadline for Wind and Solar: Credits would terminate for wind and solar facilities that begin construction after 1 year from enactment and are not placed in service before Jan. 1, 2028—facilities that begin construction within 1 year from enactment would not be subject to the placed in service deadline.

Phase-Out for other technologies: All technology other than wind and solar would phase out after 2032 as follows:

100% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2033;

75% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2034;

50% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2035; and

0% credit for facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2035.

Observation: The version of the bill that passed the House included deadlines based on beginning construction (within 60 days of enactment) and being placed in service (by Dec. 31, 2028). The Senate Finance Committee's version of the bill included a modified phaseout for wind and solar based on beginning construction by Dec. 31, 2027, however that proposal was then replaced with a placed in service deadline of Dec. 31, 2027 for projects beginning construction one year after enactment.

Observation: The accelerated timeline for wind and solar projects to be placed in service (as compared to the phase out for other technologies) presents additional challenges for developers faced with construction and supply uncertainty and potential inability to control the timing for when their facilities can be placed in service.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after enactment;

Taxpayers whose facilities are determined to be under ""effective control"" by a ""specified foreign entity"" in tax years beginning after enactment; and

Facilities that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2025, and include ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"".

Observation: Requiring that ""effective control"" be ""determined"", in this context, implies that the determination will be made during post-filing examination and enforcement.

Special ITC Recapture Rule: 100% of ITCs claimed under section 48E with respect to a property would be recaptured if a ""specified taxpayer"" (i.e., one who is allowed an ITC for any tax year beginning 2 years after enactment) makes an ""applicable payment"" within 10 years after the property is placed in service.

Transferability would continue to be available for the duration of the credit period.

Special Rule for Residential Property: No credit would be allowed for residential solar water heating property or small wind energy property if the taxpayer/owner rents or leases such property to a third party.

Observation: Projects subject to PPAs and other property (such as battery storage projects) apparently would not be subject to the rule above.

Observation: Under the current Senate bill (unlike the House bill and previous Senate Finance Committee bill), residential solar electric property would not be subject to the rule above. Therefore, residential solar electric property leased to customers would still be eligible for section 45Y or 48E credits provided that other credit eligibility requirements are satisfied.

Observation: Residential projects that can demonstrate that they began construction in 2024 would qualify for the ITC under section 48.

Nuclear Energy Communities: Advanced nuclear facilities located in a metropolitan statistical area that has (or at any time after Dec. 31, 2009 has had) 0.17% of greater direct employment related to advanced nuclear power would be eligible for the energy community bonus credit amount for PTCs under section 45Y (but not for ITCs under section 48E).

Correction to Domestic Content Percentages Under 48E: The domestic content applicable percentage under 48E for qualified facilities and energy storage technology would be revised to match current 45Y as follows:

40% (or 20% for offshore wind) if construction begins before June 16, 2025;

45% (or 27.5% for offshore wind) if construction begins after June 16, 2025, and before Jan. 1, 2026;

50% (or 35% for offshore wind) if construction begins during 2026; and

55% if construction begins after Dec. 31, 2026.

Special Rules for Fuel Cell Property: For qualified fuel cell property that begins construction after Dec. 31, 2025, the credit rate would be fixed at 30% and could not be increased or otherwise adjusted, and the zero GHG emissions requirement and recapture rule for GHG emissions greater than 10 grams of C02e per KWh would not apply.

Observation: The fixed 30% ITC rate for fuel cell property suggests that PWA compliance would no longer be necessary to qualify for the full ITC rate, however the ITC rate could not be increased through bonus credit amounts for energy community or domestic content or otherwise.

§45Q – Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit

Parity of Credit Rate: For facilities placed in service after enactment, the credit amount would be the same regardless of whether the taxpayer merely disposed of the captured carbon oxide or undertakes use or utilization of the captured carbon oxide, as follows:

$17 ($36 for direct air capture) for tax years beginning in a calendar year after 2024 and before 2027 (indexed for 2025-inflation for any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2026)

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after enactment.

§45U – Clean Electricity Production (For Existing Nuclear Facilities)

The credit would terminate for electricity produced and sold after Dec. 31, 2032.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment;

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment; and

Transferability would continue to be available for the duration of the credit period.

§45V – Clean Hydrogen Production Credit

This credit would be terminated for facilities that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2027.

Observation: The FEOC restrictions apparently would not apply to section 45V.

§45X – Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit

Except as noted below, the credit rate would phase out under the current schedule based on the date the eligible components are sold:

Before Jan. 1, 2030: 100%;

During 2030: 75%;

During 2031: 50%;

During 2032: 25%;

After Dec. 31, 2032: 0%.

Wind energy components produced and sold after December 31, 2027, would not be credit eligible.

For critical minerals other than metallurgical coal, the credit rate would phase out as follows based on the date the critical minerals are produced:

Before Jan. 1, 2031: 100%;

During 2031: 75%;

During 2032: 50%;

During 2033: 25%;

After Dec. 31, 2033: 0%.

Inclusion of Metallurgical Coal as a Critical Mineral: Metallurgical coal that is suitable for use in the production of steel (within the meaning of the Department of Energy notice ""Critical Mineral List; Addition of Metallurgical Coal Used for Steelmaking"" (90 Fed. Reg. 22711 (May 29, 2025))) would be credit-eligible at a rate of 2.5% of the costs incurred by the taxpayer with respect to production, regardless of whether such production occurs inside or outside of the United States.

Metallurgical coal produced after Dec. 31, 2029, would not be credit eligible.

Observation: Under section 45X(d)(2) (not modified by the bill), sales are taken into account for section 45X credits only when production of eligible components is within the United States (or its possession). It remains to be seen whether this provision effectively requires the production of metallurgical coal to be within the United States to be credit-eligible.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after enactment;

Taxpayers who are determined to have produced eligible components through ""effective control"" by a ""specified foreign entity"" in tax years beginning after enactment; and

Eligible components produced in tax years beginning after enactment that include any ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"".

Additional Requirement for Battery Modules: To be credit-eligible, battery modules would be required to be comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.

Sale of Integrated Components: For tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2026, sales of integrated components would remain credit-eligible only if the ""primary component"" is integrated, incorporated, or assembled into a ""secondary component"" (i) that is produced within the same manufacturing facility as the primary component, (ii) that is sold to an unrelated person, and (iii) for which not less than 65% of the total direct material costs are attributable to primary components which are mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.

Observation: Taxpayers could still elect to treat a sale of components to a related person as being made to an unrelated person.

§45Z – Clean Fuel Production Credit

The credit period would be extended until Dec. 31, 2029 (based on when the fuel is sold).

Fuel produced after December 31, 2025, would be required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

Transportation fuel emissions rates published after Dec. 31, 2025, could not be less than zero.

Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions would exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land use charge, and distinct emissions rates would be provided for transportation fuels derived from animal manure, including dairy, swine, and poultry.

Prevention of Double Credit: fuel produced from a fuel that generated a credit under section 45Z would not be credit eligible, and Treasury would be authorized to issue guidance on preventing the doubling of 45Z credits.

Sales to Unrelated Persons: Treasury would be authorized to prescribe rules for related persons whom the taxpayer has reason to believe will sell fuel to an unrelated person.

Special Rules for Sustainable Aviation Fuel:

For fuel sold or used on or after enactment (and fuel sold or used before enactment that have not yet been allowed or paid a credit under section 6426(k)), the sustainable aviation fuel credit under section 6426(k) would not be allowed for any gallon of fuel that could receive a credit under section 45Z.

For fuel produced after Dec. 31, 2025, the increased credit rate for SAF would not apply.

The sustainable aviation fuel credit under section 6426(k) would not apply to any sale or use for any period after September 30, 2025.

Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit: For fuel sold or used after June 30, 2025:

The small agri-biodiesel producer credit under section 40A would be extended to sale or use on or before Dec. 31, 2026;

The credit amount would be increased from $0.10 to $0.20 per gallon of qualified agri-biodiesel production, and would be in addition to any credit determined under section 45Z with respect to such gallon of fuel;

The small agri-biodiesel producer credit could be transferred pursuant to section 6418; and

Eligible small agri-biodiesel producers would be required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment; and

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning 2 years after enactment.

§48 – Energy Credit

The 2% energy credit would terminate for any energy property beginning construction after June 16, 2025.

Observation: For projects beginning construction on or after Jan. 1, 2025, only ground or groundwater thermal systems remain eligible for the 6% energy credit, because other energy property eligible for a 6% energy credit (including fuel cells, solar, geothermal, small wind property, waste energy recovery property, energy storage technology, biogas property, microgrid controllers, and combined heat and power property) converted to the ""tech-neutral"" ITC under section 48E.

§48C – Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit

Upon enactment, allocations revoked for failure to place the project in service within 2 years from the date of certification would not be restored to the total amount of allocations under the program.

§6418 – Transfer of Certain Credits

Unlike the House bill, the Senate bill does not include a deadline with respect to the transfer of credits; however, transfers of credits under 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z, or 48E to a ""specified foreign entity"" would be prohibited.

Observation: The preservation of transferability is undermined by the accelerated expiration of the credits themselves.

Observation: Additional FEOC requirements would apply to credits under sections 45Y,48E, and 45X that would not apply to credits under sections 45U, 45Q, 45Z, and 48.

FEOC Restrictions:

A ""prohibited foreign entity"" is either (i) a specified foreign entity or (ii) a foreign-influenced entity.

""Specified foreign entities"" include:

entities designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the Secretary of State;17

entities included on the specially designated nationals and blocked persons list maintained by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control;18

entities alleged by the Attorney General to have engaged in conduct for which a conviction was obtained under certain laws;

entities determined by the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence, to be engaged in unauthorized conduct that is detrimental to U.S national security or foreign policy;19

Chinese military company operating in the United States;20

entities Listed Under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act21; or

certain battery producing entities.22

Specified foreign entities include ""foreign controlled entities"" such as (i) the government of a covered nation (e.g., China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea), (ii) an agency or instrumentality of a government of a covered nation, (iii) a citizen or national of a covered nation without U.S. status as a citizen, national or lawful permanent resident, (iv) an entity organized under the laws of, or having its principal place of business in, a covered nation, or (v) an entity controlled by any of the above, including subsidiaries, measured by more than 50% ownership of stock in a corporation, profits interests or capital interests in a partnership, or other beneficial interest in the entity (under the section 318 attribution rules).

There would be an exception for publicly traded entities, except that (i) any exchange or market which is incorporated or organized under the laws of a covered nation or has its principal place of business in a covered nation is excluded from the definition of exchange or market for this purpose, and (ii) such entity shall still be deemed to be a foreign-controlled entity if 1 or more specified foreign entities or foreign-controlled entities controls more than 50%.

An entity is a ""foreign-influenced entity"" if:

(i) During the taxable year:

A specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint a board member, executive officer, or similar individual;

A single specified foreign entity owns at least 25% of the entity;

One or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate at least 40% of the entity; or

At least 15% of the entity's debt is held in the aggregate by one or more specified foreign entities; or

(ii) During the prior taxable year, the entity made an ""applicable payment"" to a specified foreign entity pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement which entitles the specified foreign entity (or a related entity) to exercise ""effective control"" over (i) any qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer (or any related person) or (ii) the extraction, processing, or recycling of any applicable critical mineral or production of an eligible component by the taxpayer (or any related person):

""Effective control"" generally would mean 1 or more agreements or arrangements which provide 1 or more contractual counterparties (or related person) of a taxpayer with specific authority over key aspects of the production of eligible components, energy generation, or energy storage which are not included in the measures of control through authority, ownership, or debt held.

Until FEOC guidance is issued, ""effective control"" would mean the unrestricted contractual right of a contractual counterparty to make certain major decisions for the taxpayer (including any related party to the taxpayer), such as (i) determine the quantity or timing of production of an eligible components, (ii) determine the amount or timing of activities related to the production of electricity or the storage or electrical energy, (iii) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a production unit, (iv) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a qualified facility, (v) restrict access to data critical to production or storage of energy, or to the site of production or any part of a qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer, to the personnel or agents of such contractual counterparty, or (vi) on an exclusive basis, maintain, repair, or operate any plant or equipment which is necessary to the production of eligible components or electricity.

With respect to a licensing agreement entered into with a contractual counterparty (or related person), ""effective control"" would also mean a contractual right to (i) specify or otherwise direct 1 or more sources of components, subcomponents, or applicable critical minerals, (ii) direct the operation, (iii) limit the taxpayer's utilization of intellectual property, (iv) receive royalties under the licensing agreement or any similar arrangement (or payments under any related agreement) beyond the 10th year of the agreement (including modifications or extensions), (v) direct or otherwise require the taxpayer (or any related party) to enter into an agreement for the provision of services for a duration longer than 2 years (including any modifications or extensions), or the contract, agreement, or other arrangement (vi) does not provide the licensee with all the technical data, information, and know-how necessary to enable the licensee to produce the eligible component or components subject to the contract, agreement, or other arrangement without further involvement from the contractual counterparty (or related person) or a specified foreign entity, or (vii) was entered into (or modified) on or after the date of enactment.

There would be an exception for a bona fide purchase or sale of intellectual property. However, a bona fide purchase or sale would not include any purchase or sale of intellectual property where the agreement provides that ownership of the intellectual property reverts to the contractual counterparty after a period of time.

There would be an exception for publicly traded entities, except such entity shall still be deemed to be a foreign-influenced entity if (i) a specified foreign entity has the authority to appoint a covered officer, (ii) a single specified foreign entity owns not less than 25% of the publicly traded entity, (iii) 1 or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate not less than 40% of the publicly traded entity, or (iv) debt in excess of 15% of the publicly traded debt of the publicly traded entity has been issued to 1 or more specified foreign entities.

Whether construction or production of any property includes ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"" would be determined based on whether the ""material assistance cost ratio"" is less than the ""threshold percentage"".

Threshold percentages:

For any qualified facility under sections 45Y or 48E, the threshold percentage would be:

40% if construction begins in 2026;

45% if construction begins in 2027;

50% if construction begins in 2028;

55% if construction begins in 2029; and

60% if construction begins after Dec. 31, 2029.

For energy storage technology under section 48E, the threshold percentage would be:

55% if construction begins in 2026;

60% if construction begins in 2027;

65% if construction begins in 2028;

70% if construction begins in 2029; and

75% if construction begins in after Dec. 31, 2029.

For solar energy components:

50% if sold during 2026;

60% if sold during 2027;

70% if sold during 2028;

80% if sold during 2029; and

85% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For wind energy components:

85% if sold during 2026; and

90% if sold during 2027.

For inverters:

50% if sold during 2026;

55% if sold during 2027;

60% if sold during 2028;

65% if sold during 2029; and

70% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For qualifying battery components:

60% if sold during 2026;

65% if sold during 2027;

70% if sold during 2028;

80% if sold during 2029; and

85% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For applicable critical minerals:

0% if sold after Dec. 31, 2025 and before Jan. 1, 2030;

25% if sold during 2030;

30% if sold during 2031;

40% if sold during 2032; and

50% if sold after Dec. 31, 2032.

Observation: For purposes of the FEOC requirements, the Senate bill would codify that ""beginning of construction"" for tax purposes is determined pursuant to rules under IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either Notice), as in effect on Jan. 1, 2025.

Observation: Treasury would be required to issue guidance not later than Dec. 31, 2027 applying new threshold percentages for critical minerals equaling or exceeding these amounts, taking into account domestic geographic availability, supply chain constraints, domestic processing capacity needs, and national security concerns.

Material assistance cost ratios:

For any qualified facility or energy storage technology, the material assistance cost ratio is the ratio of (i) the total costs of all manufactured products incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology upon completion of construction minus such costs that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, divided by (ii) the total costs of all manufactured products incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology upon completion of construction.

""Manufactured product"" has the same meaning as provided in domestic content guidance.

For any product line that produces eligible components, the material assistance cost ratio is the ratio of (i) the total direct materials costs that are paid or incurred for production of such eligible components minus such costs that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, divided by (ii) the total direct materials costs that are paid or incurred for production of such eligible components.

Safe harbor tables: Not later than Dec. 31, 2026, Treasury would be required to issue safe harbor tables. Until then, and for qualified facilities that begin construction within 60 days after the issuance of such tables, a taxpayer may (i) use the tables provided in the domestic content safe harbor guidance (IRS Notice 2025-08) to establish the total direct material cost of any listed eligible component or manufactured product and (ii) rely on a certification by the supplier that the manufactured product, eligible component, constituent element, material, or subcomponent was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

Certification requirement: The certification from the supplier would be required to (i) include the supplier's EIN, (ii) be signed under penalty of perjury, (iii) be retained by the supplier for not less than 6 years and be provided to the IRS upon request, and (iv) state either (1) that such property was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity and that the supplier does not know (or have reason to know) that any prior supplier in the chain of production of that property is a prohibited foreign entity, or (2) the total direct material cost for each product or component that were not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

If a taxpayer knows or has reason to know that a manufactured product or eligible component was produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, then the taxpayer must treat all direct material costs with respect to such product or component as mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity and may not rely on a certification from the supplier.

Binding written contract exception: Upon the election of the taxpayer (in form and manner to be designated by Treasury), any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent element, material, or subcomponent acquired by the taxpayer pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, and placed in service before Jan. 1, 2030 (January 1, 2028 in the case of solar and wind property used to generate electricity) in a facility that began construction before August 1, 2025, would not be included for purposes of determining the material assistance cost ratio.

Observation: The imposition of FEOC rules to tax credit qualification would introduce an additional layer of complexity. The statute would further authorize the Treasury Department to issue regulations under these rules, including establishing rules to prevent evasion, circumvention, or abuse of the rules through (i) impermissible technology licensing arrangements with specified foreign entities, (ii) abuse of the binding written contract exception through stockpiling of any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent material, or subcomponent during any period prior to application of the rules, or where the facts and circumstances demonstrate that the beginning of construction of a qualified facility or energy storage technology has not in fact occurred.

Extended assessment period: Any deficiency attributable to an error in the determination of material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity could be assessed within 6 years after the return for such year was filed.

Accuracy-related penalty: If there is a ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"", then the substantial understatement of income tax penalty would apply to understatements of income tax by more than 1% of the tax required to be shown on the return.

A ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" would be disallowance of a credit under sections 45X, 45Y, or 48E by reason of overstating the material assistance cost ratio.

For an entity claiming direct pay under section 6417, a ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" would cause an ""excessive payment"" and incur the 20% penalty on the amount of the excessive payment (unless the taxpayer shows reasonable cause).

Penalty for false certification of supplier: If an inaccurate or false certification by a supplier results in the ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" and the understatement of income tax exceeds the lesser of (i) 5% of the tax required to be shown on the return or (ii) $100,000, then the person making the certification would be required to pay a penalty equal to the greater of (a) 10% of the amount of the underpayment attributable to the inaccuracy or falsity or (b) $5,000 (unless the person shows reasonable cause).

In line with other European nations, Türkiye’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation has announced a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate in a bid to cut aviation emissions by 5% by 2030.

The planned regulations aim to align with the UN International Civil Aviation Organization’s emissions reduction scheme, which will become mandatory in 2027.

Meeting the mandate

Under the new rules, airlines operating international flights to and from Türkiye will need to use enough SAF to meet the 5% emissions reduction goal. Fuel suppliers will also be required to procure enough SAF to meet that target, while domestic refiners including Tupras and Socar will be expected to begin local production.

Türkiye’s largest oil refiner, Tupras, plans to introduce 20,000 metric tonnes of SAF at one of its major plants in 2026. It also aims to increase production to 400,000 tonnes by constructing a new unit at its Izmir refinery, pending a final investment. Meanwhile, local biofuel firm DB Tarımsal Enerji plans to produce 100,000 tons of SAF at a new plant.

According to the country’s energy regulator, Türkiye’s jet fuel demand fell 4% in 2024 to 6.26 million tonnes.

The Civil Aviation Authority also revealed it will publish minimum emission reduction targets before the end of the third quarter each year and will impose penalties on airlines and jet fuel suppliers that are non-compliant. Airlines must also ensure that 90% of the SAF required for international flights is uplifted in Türkiye.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/fuel.jpg,N,,2025-07-01 19:03:47.652463

The biofuel, which can be blended with regular jet fuel, is expected to be the biggest contributor in the industry’s decarbonisation efforts. According to PREETI JAIN, head, Net Zero Transition Programs at global airline industry body International Air Transport Association (IATA), India is well-positioned to emerge as an international SAF manufacturing hub, provided it capitalises on the opportunity with concerted efforts, primarily through a policy push and incentives for the segment’s value chain. In an interaction with SUKALP SHARMA, Jain delves into the global SAF ecosystem, its challenges, lessons from other regions, mandates-versus-incentives debate, and the road ahead globally as well as in India. Edited excerpts:

How critical is SAF for the global aviation industry’s decarbonisation targets? Is SAF production on track to meet multilateral requirements and regional and country-specific mandates?

There are four things which we have identified for the decarbonisation roadmap —sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), operational efficiencies, (carbon) offset, and hydrogen and electric planes. All of them are important. While all are important, SAF alone is likely to account for over 60 per cent (in decarbonisation)… On SAF, it is important to understand that even if we deploy all the solutions today, they can only bring a certain level of carbon emission reduction. We are still far away from our final goal, as well as mid-term and short-term goals, because SAF currently stands at just around 0.7 per cent of global jet fuel production. We map around 300 renewable fuel projects around the world, and we considered 160 projects for our assessment. We saw that nearly 54 per cent of the projects are just announcements; all of them want to produce SAF by 2030. Each plant would likely take at least four-five years to be built, and it doesn’t look likely that many would be ready by 2030.

Having earlier worked in this domain in India, how do you see the country’s SAF ecosystem?

I have witnessed this ecosystem for more than 10 years in India. I’d say India is headed in the right direction and should do fine in meeting the initial requirements. Interestingly, India wants to come up with its tailor-made policies which can help its own ecosystem. The country has announced its intent to have time-bound SAF blending targets. But we are yet to see a firm roadmap and the implementation plan. Various Indian energy companies are working on SAF projects. These companies have always come forward to do what is required by the government and international commitments. So, I’m positive about India. The question is would India be happy just doing the bare minimum to meet mandates and requirements? Or does it want to be ahead of the curve and start making SAF not just for Indian airlines, but also for international airlines operating to India? There is enough ethanol supply in the country, and some of it can be diverted to make SAF… India wants to export ethanol, and similarly, SAF also presents a similar opportunity. There can be a ‘make in India for the world’ opportunity in SAF. India can potentially manufacture 40 million tonnes of SAF by 2050.

What is it that India should do to meet SAF requirements as well as become an SAF manufacturing hub?

India should prioritise feedstock for the production of SAF without waiting further, leverage the existing refining capability, invest in the research and innovation and new technologies. Funding should be made available to projects as well as the feedstock aggregation supply chains. It also needs to be ensured that the SAF manufactured in India meets all sustainability certification criteria, and that needs to start now, not when the plants are ready for production.

Europe already has SAF blending mandates which have come much before CORSIA’s mandatory phase kicks in (from 2027). Is it a move in the right direction?

Mandates and incentives need to come together in the right proportion. While there is already a mandate in Europe, the fundamental question is about the ecosystem, is it ready? That ecosystem readiness was not there, and in such a scenario, mandates aren’t going to really be effective. Much of the SAF being used in Europe is coming from different continents. Does it even make sense, considering long-haul transportation of the fuel itself would have a high carbon footprint? That is why we are asking for incentives to be brought in so that the local ecosystem is prepared with enough domestic production.

Why does IATA seem to be opposed to the way Europe is going about SAF mandates?

What airlines are being charged for SAF in Europe is not on a cost-plus basis. They are being charged exorbitant compliance fees and there is no transparency in the cost structure. We don’t understand what is the rationale behind these high numbers. We estimate that this non-transparent compliance fee is adding an additional $1.7 billion to the cost of SAF for airlines in Europe on top of the cost of SAF, which itself is quite high. It was already a supply-constrained market and then you (Europe) introduced mandates, which essentially means that the airline is bound to buy SAF at any price, or be penalised…Also, our position on SAF is that it should be feedstock agnostic and technology neutral. All technologies should compete, and the market forces would lead to the best and the most efficient ones being picked up. But Europe has put a sub-mandate for the power-to-liquid (PTL) pathway for SAF production. That puts other pathways and technologies (like alcohol-to-jet, which various companies are working on) at a disadvantage.

Unlike what is happening in Europe, the US is seen as a success story on SAF use. What did they do differently?

The US provided incentives around the value chain. In one sense, Europe and the US are very similar, in that they provided a lot of funding and research for these technologies to mature. But the US went a step ahead. They provided production-linked incentives, they subsidised the feedstock, gave other incentives that led to the SAF feedstock supply chain being streamlined there, etc. Then there were tax credits for SAF production and blending. Additionally, apart from the central or federal incentives, some US states also had their own incentive plans. Many of the SAF facilities also need hydrogen, so the US also provided some incentives for green hydrogen production. Essentially, they worked on bits and pieces across the SAF value chain.

Are US-like incentives the answer for boosting SAF production? Is it something that can easily be replicated in other parts of the world?

There is enough biorefinery capacity around the world. The question is, how can governments provide the right incentives for these biorefineries to switch their production in the favour of SAF. A biorefinery is not built specifically for renewable diesel or SAF for that matter. These capacities can swing very quickly to produce SAF. We can have sufficient production of SAF to meet the airlines’ demand—voluntary as well as the mandates. Governments should seriously look at incentives for SAF production, like facilitating offtake, providing subsidies, etc… Let’s take the example of solar and wind in India and elsewhere. Governments provided production-linked incentives, tax holidays, and subsidies. We need the same story in the SAF ecosystem.",https://www.processingjournal.com/assets/favicons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-07-01 21:02:24.795681

Washington, DC, July 1, 2025 – The National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) welcomes today’s Senate passage of several provisions to promote the growth, safety and sustainability of U.S. aviation included in a revised budget-reconciliation bill.

Similar NBAA-supported provisions were passed by the House of Representatives in a budget reconciliation package on May 22 that was referred to the Senate.

While the Senate made numerous changes to the House legislation, similar items in the Senate’s version include a $12.52 billion down payment to fund transformation of the nation’s air traffic control (ATC) technologies, facilities and other infrastructure.

Announced by House leaders in April, the ATC-funding proposal has the backing of NBAA and more than 50 other leading aviation organizations comprising the recently formed Modern Skies Coalition.

“We thank the Senate for recognizing with this initial funding that a safe and efficient national airspace requires a robust, resilient ATC system that bolsters our nation’s global aviation leadership,” said NBAA President and CEO Ed Bolen.

The Senate legislation also includes a permanent reinstatement of full and immediate expensing on purchases of factory-new and pre-owned aircraft. The expensing schedule, most recently renewed in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, is set to expire in 2027.

“As leading economists have found, immediate expensing helps companies and entrepreneurs relying on business aviation have access to a critical competitive asset, while strengthening America’s manufacturing base,” Bolen said, noting the sector supports 1.3 million jobs and accounts for $340 billion in annual economic activity.

The Senate bill also includes a measure related to business aviation’s goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 – an additional four-year extension of the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, but with a reduction in the value of the credit from $1.75/gal to $1.00/gal. While the credit is among the initiatives that spurred the doubling of U.S. SAF production from December 2024 to February 2025, the reduction in credit value could make it difficult to meet increasing demand.

The wide-ranging bill now moves back to the House this week for a final vote. If approved, it will head to the president to be signed into law.

“These provisions represent an important investment in an essential American industry, and the citizens, companies and communities that depend on it,” Bolen concluded. “NBAA looks forward to their continued progress.”

As part of its sustainability roadmap, British Airways has committed to powering 10% of its flights with SAF by 2030 (the UK government has since set a SAF Mandate). EcoCeres will provide SAF produced from 100% waste-based biomass feedstock, such as used cooking oil (UCO). This SAF has the potential to provide a lifecycle carbon reduction of up to 80% compared to the traditional jet fuel it replaces.

Matti Lievonen, CEO of EcoCeres, stated, “We are proud to partner with British Airways in this strategic agreement to jointly tackle greenhouse gas emissions in aviation. Our commitment to sustainability is unwavering, and this partnership exemplifies our dedication to providing innovative fuel solutions that will help the aviation industry meet its environmental targets. Together, we are contributing to the broader effort of reducing emissions in transportation.”

Carrie Harris, Director of Sustainability at British Airways, added, “At British Airways, we see sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as an important part of our BA Better World strategy. In 2024 alone, SAF accounted for 2.7% of British Airways’ total fuel use and is contributing to our achievement of a 13% reduction in our carbon intensity since 2019. That’s why this new agreement with EcoCeres is so exciting - it's another important step forward on our journey to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.”

As EcoCeres continues to expand its production capabilities and partnerships, the company remains committed to innovation in the sustainable fuel sector. This agreement with British Airways marks a significant milestone in EcoCeres’ journey to lead the way in sustainable aviation fuel solutions.

About Sustainable Aviation Fuel

‘Sustainable Aviation Fuels ‘(‘SAF’) are defined in the Refuel EU Aviation Regulation as aviation fuels that are either synthetic aviation fuels, aviation biofuels or recycled carbon aviation fuels.

SAF produces similar levels of carbon dioxide to conventional aviation fuels when burned, but the carbon dioxide generated is already part of the carbon cycle and is not extracted from the ground specifically for creating aviation fuel. This means that using SAF results in a reduction in carbon emissions compared to the traditional jet fuel it replaces over the lifecycle of the fuel. A major challenge is that SAF availability remains low globally and today accounts for 2.7% of our total fuel.

As SAF is similar in chemistry to traditional fossil jet fuel, it can be dropped straight into existing fuel supply infrastructure and aircraft without modification. As a result, it is the readiest solution to reduce the carbon emissions associated with aviation. Emission reductions from the use of SAF are measured as the reduction of carbon emissions on a greenhouse gas lifecycle basis, typically by 80% or more compared with the fossil jet fuels it replaces.
