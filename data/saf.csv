Well, our recent study found that even with optimistic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and fuel efficiency assumptions, the net-zero carbon target could be exceeded as early as 2037.
Therefore, to meet the 2050 net-zero target, accelerating efforts to develop ZEPs seems critical.
It will also feature an updated version of the ICCT’s net-zero aviation roadmap, which for the first time will include the climate impact of non-CO2 emissions.
The recent setbacks are a wake-up call and these indicators will tell us if ZEPs can move from prototypes to actionable climate solutions.","Just a few years ago, proposals for zero-emission planes (ZEPs) were regularly attracting headlines for their potential to dramatically reduce global carbon emissions from aviation. But now things are rather different, as the past several months have been filled with setbacks. Let’s consider what this means for efforts by policymakers and the aviation industry to achieve aviation’s target of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050.

The most high-profile setback came when Airbus pushed back its ambitious goal to introduce hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft in 2035. Citing a mix of infrastructure challenges and slower-than-expected technology development, it made the announcement during the Airbus Summit 2025 and expects a 5-10-year delay. Airbus isn’t alone. Other manufacturers have recently dialed back plans or hit financial difficulties. Why this turbulence? Well, as with Airbus, the primary challenges are technology and infrastructure.

Technologically, battery-electric aircraft remain limited to serving short routes (less than 500 km) due to severe battery weight limitations. Jet fuel is still roughly 50 times more energy dense than today’s most advanced lithium battery. While jet fuel contains about 43 MJ/kg of energy, the most advanced lithium-ion batteries today offer only around 0.9–1.0 MJ/kg, making them roughly 40 to 50 times less energy dense by weight. The additional battery weight increases the total mass the aircraft must lift and thus the energy to sustain flight—creating a compounding penalty. Hydrogen technologies such as fuel cells and combustion engines can offer greater range but face their own set of engineering hurdles, particularly concerning the need to develop lighter hydrogen storage tanks and more powerful fuel cells to minimize their significant mass and volume penalty. One of the major aircraft manufacturers, Embraer, recently pushed back its Energia project, a family of low-emission hybrid-electric aircraft, because both battery and hydrogen fuel cell advancements have been slower than hoped. This necessitated the delay of the project from its original intended entry-into-service year of 2035.

Infrastructure is probably an even bigger barrier. Airbus noted that inadequate hydrogen infrastructure—including hydrogen production, distribution, and fueling facilities, airport expansion and modification, and new safety protocols—is one of the major roadblocks to its ZEROe program, the flagship hydrogen-powered aircraft initiative aimed at launching the world’s first commercial ZEP. Indeed, green hydrogen, which is produced using renewable electricity and water electrolysis, comprised less than 1% of global hydrogen production in 2024. And even if green hydrogen were being produced in large volumes, the infrastructure to reliably distribute hydrogen remains sparse and expensive to build. Regulatory frameworks are also lagging, and that’s creating uncertainty and slowing investment. For example, Airbus recently reduced the budget for ZEROe by 25%.

What about the innovative startups we heard about a few years ago? Universal Hydrogen, a U.S.-based company that aimed to decarbonize regional aviation by retrofitting planes to run on hydrogen fuel cells, achieved a remarkable goal when it flew the largest aircraft ever on hydrogen-electric power. However, Universal shut down a year later after failing to secure enough funding to continue research and development. Eviation, an electric-plane startup based in Washington state, paused its Alice program and laid off most of its employees. That these firms struggled to secure the substantial funding and regulatory support necessary to scale is a lesson for the aviation industry: Zero-emission flight requires sustained and coordinated investment and collaboration beyond the reach of individual companies.

What does this all mean for aviation’s climate targets? Well, our recent study found that even with optimistic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and fuel efficiency assumptions, the net-zero carbon target could be exceeded as early as 2037. Therefore, to meet the 2050 net-zero target, accelerating efforts to develop ZEPs seems critical. But with Airbus and others suggesting that 2035 is infeasible, achieving the net-zero target by 2050 looks more difficult than ever.

This puts more pressure on SAF, technical efficiency improvements, and operational optimization to fill the gap. Due in part to this reality, hybrid-electric solutions have emerged as intermediate alternatives because they can be integrated in the medium term and offer moderate emission reductions (even though they are short of climate goals, including when combined with SAFs).

The upcoming update to our Vision 2050 report will reflect the latest industry realities and reassess the role that ZEPs, SAFs, and other mitigation measures must play to realistically meet global targets. It will also feature an updated version of the ICCT’s net-zero aviation roadmap, which for the first time will include the climate impact of non-CO2 emissions.

Ultimately, stakeholders have to ask: Are hydrogen tanks getting lighter? Are fuel cells getting more powerful? Is battery chemistry improving? The recent setbacks are a wake-up call and these indicators will tell us if ZEPs can move from prototypes to actionable climate solutions. Even if there is continued progress on the technology side, the business case will need to be addressed—both the capital and regulatory aspects—to make ZEPs into a reality. In the meantime, as important as ZEPs are to the long-term solution, to stay on track for 2050 it’s likely that policymakers and the aviation industry will have to focus on alternative measures that can deliver medium-term emission savings.",https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AdobeStock_431775423_scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 06:56:08.015878

Stay tuned for Aerospace Global News’ second day of coverage from day two of of the event.","As Sustainable Skies World Summit (SSWS) opened its doors to the industry on day one of the annual event, “climate change is not a choice,” reiterated Jonathan Counsell, group director of sustainability, IAG Group. And buoyed yet again with the underlying imperative that it takes an entire industry’s input to address aviation’s ongoing sustainability challenges, attendees from across the sector – from airlines to fuel producers, innovators and regulators – arrived at Farnborough International for two days of insight and discussion.

Welcoming over 110 speakers across the event, complemented by 36 showcase exhibitors, the elevated number of attendees at the summit was certainly indicative of the scale of the challenge. Now in its fourth iteration, SSWS attendance has risen exponentially from a few hundred attendees in 2022 to some 1,300 plus, explained Counsell, who stressed: “Climate change is not a PR opportunity. And it’s not if we address it, it’s how”.

Certainly, the scope of the global challenge at hand – the decarbonisation of a sector universally acknowledged as ‘hard to abate’ – was not shied away from. Although the UK has halved its carbon emissions since 1990, explained independent advisor the Climate Change Committee (CCC), much work remains to be done. Notably, with around 50% of UK carbon emissions reductions in 2008 attributable to evolving energy supplies, the recommended 7th carbon budget for 2040 (CB7) will require a shift in focus. And despite agricultural and land use set to comprise some 35% alone of this reduction alone, aviation invariably has its part to play, too. By 2040, the CCC’s roadmap projects that SAF will be responsible for some 33% of emissions savings; helping to address what could otherwise become an “existential industry for the industry” – with aviation and agriculture nevertheless set to become the two biggest greenhouse gas emitting sectors by 2040.

As such, the time to start addressing these challenges is now. From pioneering propulsion systems and alternative fuels (such as SAF, electrification and hydrogen) to carbon sequestration, offset strategies, efficiency advancements and clean-sheet aircraft deigns, a thoughtful day of panel discussions and workshops faced the industry’s challenges head-on. Although many ‘pathway to net zero’ roadmaps have been drawn up, “the only thing we can say with any certainty is that all roadmaps are wrong,” mused Anna Stukas, VP of strategic partnerships at carbon capture and storage company 1PointFive. However, with the “building blocks” already in place to effect meaningful change and “leverage strengths”, she urged that “taking small steps is OK” (even if each of these so-called ‘baby steps’ represent significant technological progression and millions, if not billions, of dollars at a time).

And there is ample cause for optimism along the way. Net zero analysis from the UK Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) estimates SAF will play a 25%-30% part in reducing emissions by 2050, with many calling for further government support to solidify revenue certainty mechanisms and bolster production. As Jill Blickstein, chief sustainability officer at American Airlines, succinctly explained: “SAF doesn’t have to be a partisan issue – it’s a growth issue”.

Indeed, over the past 20 years, crude oil has fluctuated from between $0.50 to $4 a gallon, revealed Jan Toshka, CEO of sustainable aviation fuel venture Zaffra highlighted. Amid fears that SAF surcharges may price many people out of flying (with fuel currently accountable for around 25% of the overall ticket price), the industry has still grown, he highlighted. Additionally, while airlines can’t begin “engaging with every passenger on the planet,” it’s important to build long-term trust, he suggested.

While SAF remains the largest widely-accepted lever to accelerate aviation’s short-term decarbonisation efforts, hydrogen’s potential also remains a key factor, with airports such as London Heathrow and Amsterdam Schiphol also highlighting their perspectives on the future of infrastructure decisions. These are “really significant choices and investment decisions,” suggested London Heathrow’s carbon strategy director Matt Gorman, citing sustainability concerns as at the heart of any future expansion plans.

From airports to the types of aircraft themselves- with Germany’s all-electric Vaeridion and the US Otto Aviation’s laminar-flow business jet representing two vastly different aircraft concepts discussed during the day – it seems there is no single solution or lack of innovation on hand. Even airspace modernisation – acknowledged by NATS sustainability, and health and safety director Ian Jopson as a relatively small financial outlay offering huge benefits – has its part to play. Although a moderately small contribution, “we know how do to it,” he suggested, proving that even comparatively small investments could account for up to 5% of the total carbon savings (according to UK Aerospace Technology Institute analysis).

Although methods and strategies – seen by many as complementary rather than contradictory – may differ, this overall determination to innovate is “really part of our history,” concluded Cesar Perira, chief sustainability officer at Embraer.

WTTC Urges the Travel & Tourism Industry to Collaborate on Scaling Sustainable Aviation Fuel for a Net-Zero FutureIn a landmark move, the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), in partnership with global consultancy ICF, has released a comprehensive new framework urging the global Travel & Tourism sector to unite in tackling one of its most pressing challenges: scaling up the production and adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other renewable fuels.

This call to action comes at a critical time when the sector is striving to meet ambitious net-zero targets and address its significant carbon footprint.

The Challenge: Scaling Sustainable Aviation Fuel Supply to Match Demand

Julia Simpson, WTTC President and CEO, highlighted the urgency of addressing the supply-demand imbalance for SAF:

“Sustainable fuel is the single biggest game-changer for Travel & Tourism, but right now, supply falls dangerously short of demand. If we don’t act together, we risk rising costs, limited availability, and stalled climate progress.”

Today, SAF accounts for a mere 0.3% of global jet fuel consumption. To align with net-zero emissions goals by 2050, production needs to increase more than 400-fold — from approximately 1.25 billion litres to over 450 billion litres annually. Achieving this scale will require establishing around 6,500 new renewable fuel plants globally. Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF), which similarly addresses maritime transport emissions, faces analogous production and infrastructure barriers.

Why SAF is a Crucial, Practical Solution

Unlike some decarbonisation options that require new aircraft or engine technologies, SAF is a ‘drop-in’ fuel, meaning it can be used directly in existing engines and infrastructure without modification. This characteristic makes it an attractive and immediate solution for reducing aviation emissions.

However, the challenges of high production costs, limited feedstock availability, and underdeveloped infrastructure have kept SAF production volumes low and prices significantly higher than conventional jet fuel — sometimes up to ten times more expensive. Overcoming these hurdles is essential for broad adoption.

WTTC-ICF Framework: A Blueprint for Sector-Wide Engagement

The new report, Scaling Up Sustainable Fuel, provides a practical roadmap tailored to different types of businesses within the Travel & Tourism ecosystem, including hotels, tour operators, travel agencies, cruise lines, and airlines. It defines clear roles businesses can assume to support SAF growth, categorized as:

Collaborators: Entities that join campaigns, promote sustainable fuels, and share best practices.

Promoters: Those who actively educate stakeholders and customers on sustainable fuel benefits.

Adopters: Companies purchasing SAF or sustainable fuel certificates to reduce their carbon footprint.

Investors: Businesses funding production facilities or infrastructure development to increase SAF availability.

This tiered approach ensures that every organization, regardless of size or resources, can contribute meaningfully to scaling sustainable fuel use.

Insights from Industry Leaders and Case Studies

Daniel Galpin, Managing Director of ICF, emphasized the crucial role of the wider tourism ecosystem in supporting decarbonisation:

“Decarbonising transport is a crucial step towards achieving a sustainable tourism sector. While transport industries, particularly aviation with its focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), have recognised the importance of sustainable fuels and are courageously working towards a new era, there remains a significant journey ahead.”

Real-world examples underscore progress already underway:

The Erawan Group in Asia is innovatively converting hotel waste oil into SAF, turning waste into a valuable, renewable resource.

Jet2 has invested in a UK-based SAF plant that utilizes recyclable household waste, exemplifying circular economy principles.

These cases demonstrate how different stakeholders across Travel & Tourism can harness innovative solutions to support sustainable fuel production.

Economic and Environmental Imperatives for Scaling SAF

Travel & Tourism is forecasted to generate $16.5 trillion and support over 460 million jobs globally by 2035. The sector’s growth is vital to economies worldwide, but it must proceed sustainably to protect the environment.

Government bodies, such as the UK’s Department for Transport (DfT) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), emphasize the importance of transitioning to renewable fuels to meet climate commitments under the Paris Agreement and national net-zero targets.

The European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, part of the EU’s broader “Fit for 55” climate package, mandates increasing SAF use on flights operating in the bloc, illustrating government efforts to regulate and stimulate sustainable fuel uptake (European Commission Aviation).

The Risk of Inaction: Rising Costs and Consumer Impact

The WTTC-ICF report warns that without collective sector action, governments may impose SAF mandates requiring airlines to blend 5% to 10% SAF into jet fuel by 2030.

Without sufficient supply and cooperative engagement from the Travel & Tourism industry, these mandates could lead to increased travel costs and reduced consumer choice, potentially dampening demand and stalling tourism recovery post-pandemic.

Therefore, proactive investment and participation from all tourism businesses are essential to scale supply, reduce costs, and ensure an equitable transition.

Broader Role of Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF)

In addition to aviation, sustainable marine fuels are critical for decarbonizing the cruise and shipping sectors. Like SAF, SMF adoption faces challenges related to feedstock competition, production costs, and infrastructure development. The WTTC encourages the maritime sector within Travel & Tourism to also align with sustainable fuel scaling efforts to achieve holistic industry decarbonisation.

Government and Industry Collaboration: A Key to Success

Governments play a pivotal role in incentivizing SAF production through policy instruments such as tax credits, subsidies, and research funding.

The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive set examples of ambitious policies designed to accelerate sustainable fuel market growth.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) advocates for public-private partnerships to bridge investment gaps and create viable supply chains.

Conclusion: A Collective Call to Action

Sustainable fuel represents both an environmental necessity and a business imperative for the Travel & Tourism sector.

WTTC’s new framework highlights that from hotels and tour operators to airlines and cruise lines, every business has a critical role in scaling production and adoption of SAF and SMF.

The path to net-zero emissions requires collaboration, innovation, and strategic investment.

The UK Government has implemented new measures today (14 May 2025) to help the UK become a world leader in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), supporting industry growth and boosting jobs nationwide.

Sustainable aviation fuel is an alternative to fossil jet fuel, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 70% on average on a lifecycle basis. Sustainable fuel is more costly than jet fuel; however, the new measures will protect the industry and consumers from excessive costs.

£400,000 funding to speed up clean fuel production

Decarbonisation is an essential factor in accelerating expansion plans, and to get sustainable aviation fuel to the market quicker, the government has allocated an additional £400,000 in funding to help producers get the fuel on the market quicker. This funding will support testing and qualification of green fuels and follows £63m funding made available through the Advanced Fuels Fund this year.

Additionally, the revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) will keep ticket price changes minimal, keeping fluctuations to £1.50 a year on average. It will be industry-funded through a levy for aviation fuel suppliers. The Department for Transport (DfT) will continue to engage with the industry on the details of the RCM, including pricing.

This new commitment to sustainable aviation fuel will help fulfill the government’s mission to deliver economic growth through job creation, making it a clean energy superpower. It will allow the UK to go further and faster with expansion plans, boosting the tourism industry.

Aviation Minister Mike Kane said: “I want to see a golden age for green aviation, and today, we see take-offs for sustainable flights.

Aviation continues to be one of the fastest growing and most integral parts of the UK’s economy, offering more jobs across engineering, tourism and hospitality, and as we support aviation expansion, we need to move at full throttle towards decarbonisation.

We are making the UK one of the best places in the world to produce sustainable aviation fuel, putting the pedal down on growth and boosting job opportunities across the country as part of the Plan for Change.”

10% of all jet fuels must be made sustainably

The new measures will help the industry meet its requirements under the SAF Mandate, introduced in January this year, requiring at least 10% of all jet fuel used in UK flights from 2030 with sustainable fuel, rising to 22% by 2040.

The funding confirms the UK’s commitment to building a homegrown, sustainable fuel production hub. Low-carbon fuels could add up to £5bn to the economy by 2050 and position the UK as a global hub for sustainable aviation fuel production.

Tim Alderslade, Chief Executive of Airlines UK, said: “This is a welcome announcement given the importance of the RCM to commercialising and scaling up SAF production in the UK, a technology key to decarbonising aviation by 2050. A UK SAF industry, kick-started by the RCM and SAF Mandate, can create tens of thousands of jobs across the country whilst supporting our world-class aviation sector to deliver economic growth.

We look forward to working with government on scheme design and how contracts are allocated, so that we balance the need to deliver the SAF required to support mandate compliance, whilst keeping costs as low as possible through a competitive and transparent bidding process that places the consumer at its heart.”

Duncan McCourt, Chief Executive of Sustainable Aviation, said: “We hugely welcome the publication of this important legislation. SAF is a crucial element in the plan to decarbonise aviation as it can be used in existing aircraft with existing infrastructure.

The challenge now is to scale the industry, ensuring we have enough SAF to meet the mandate whilst keeping costs low and create thousands of jobs in the process. This legislation will help to do that.”",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iStock-1278067350-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 05:56:12.727687

The 2025 Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix will be the first of the nine European races to use a low carbon energy system across the paddock area, delivering an approximate 90% reduction in associated carbon emissions.

Supplied by Formula 1 partner Aggreko, the rollout to all European events follows successful trials at the 2023 Austrian Grand Prix, and the 2024 Austrian, Hungarian, and Italian Grands Prix, all of which yielded significant carbon reductions in the Paddock, Pit Lane, and Event Technical Centre.

The paddock-wide solution will centralise energy supply into one compound powered by renewable sources, such as hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), solar panels, and battery energy storage systems (BESS), and remove the requirement for Formula 1, the 10 F1 teams, and the FIA to use their own generators.

In addition to the carbon reduction through centralised, renewable energy generation, the reduction in on-site generators will also minimise associated transportation emissions.

The return of DHL’s biofuel fleet trucks across the European stint provides Formula 1 with another way to operate more sustainably through the use of alternative fuels.

In 2023, the use of biofuel-powered trucks during the European leg of the season resulted in an average reduction of logistics-related emissions by 83% compared to traditional fuels. This year, DHL will once again use 37 of its trucks to transport freight across Europe.

At the beginning of the season, F2 and F3 cars successfully made the move to Aramco’s 100% advanced sustainable fuel, following the use of 55% sustainable fuel last season. This move comes ahead of the Formula 1 cars adopting the fuels in 2026 in the new hybrid engines that will take to the circuit next year.

The move to 100% advanced sustainable fuels is an instrumental part of the sport’s alternative fuel strategy, as well as having a wider impact in the automotive industry, as the fuel developed by Formula 1 will be a ‘drop-in’ and can be used in road cars without modification, serving as a sustainable alternative of global benefit.

Formula 1’s alternative fuel strategy is a pivotal part of how the sport continues to reduce carbon emissions today. Last year, Formula 1 made significant investments in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), delivering an estimated 80% reduction in associated carbon emissions per flight compared to the use of conventional aviation fuel.

The combined investment in SAF with Global Partners DHL and Qatar Airways reduced total related emissions by more than 8,000 tCO2e (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent), an approximate 19% reduction in related emissions compared to traditional aviation fuel across the flyaway events of the 2024 season.

Transcript

Did you know that leftover cooking oil can help power an A380 engine? Let me explain. Sustainable aviation fuel, or safe for short, is an alternative to traditional jet fuel. But how is it made? SAF, unlike traditional jet fuel, isn't derived from fossil sources. It's made from feedstock like agricultural waste, sugar cane byproducts, and even algae to produce SAP. Feed stocks are refined through chemical processing, then tested and certified to make sure that the end product meets all the performance, safety, and certification requirements of traditional jet fuel. The SAF is then blended with traditional jet fuel and drop straight. Some existing fueling infrastructure. Aviation is a hard to abate sector, which means there aren't many readily available solutions to help us reach our emissions targets. SAF is currently the single biggest lever we have to reduce aviation emissions. And today, alongside Sydney Airport, AMPOL and supported by our S Coalition made-up of leading Australian and international organisations, we're marking the largest ever commercial importation of SAF into Australia, with nearly 2,000,000 litres arriving this week. We've already begun taking steps to help us. Published a domestic sustainable aviation fuel industry in Australia which has the potential to not only lower emissions but create thousands of jobs across Australia and increase national fuel security.

Drawing from the science of leadership and the timeless lessons of musical legends, here are seven powerful ways leaders can transform their teams into high-performing ensembles.
Leadership takeaway: In today’s hyper-distracted workplaces, attention has become the new competitive advantage.
Like great musicians, great leaders don’t scatter their energy; they channel it.
Leadership takeaway: Excellence doesn’t happen by accident; it’s engineered.","In business, as in music, true mastery isn’t about striving for mechanical perfection but resonance, rhythm and trust.

Before I became a business strategist and certified neuroleadership coach, I was a professional bassist, trained in classical and jazz performance. What I learned on the concert stage about collaboration, adaptation and peak performance now informs everything I teach leaders about orchestrating high-performing teams.

Today, neuroscience confirms what great musicians have always known: peak team performance is a synchronized act of emotional connection, cognitive agility and intentional practice. Research published in Harvard Business Review shows that teams with strong emotional bonds and psychological safety outperform others by as much as 27% on complex tasks. Similarly, a study in Frontiers in Psychology found that musical ensembles’ ability to synchronize with each other relies on shared mental models — a principle equally vital for organizational success.

Drawing from the science of leadership and the timeless lessons of musical legends, here are seven powerful ways leaders can transform their teams into high-performing ensembles.

1. Practice like Prince: Focus is a superpower

Prince was more than a talented performer — he was a perfectionist of craft. He mastered dozens of instruments, choreographed his shows and oversaw production. His obsessive focus wasn’t accidental; it was a practiced discipline.

Leadership takeaway: In today’s hyper-distracted workplaces, attention has become the new competitive advantage. According to Harvard Business Review, multitasking can reduce productivity by as much as 40%. Leaders who try to juggle everything dilute their impact.

What to do:

Create a daily “focus setlist” identifying your top three critical priorities.

Schedule uninterrupted blocks (at least 90 minutes) for strategic thinking.

Protect these blocks like sound checks before a concert — non-negotiable.

Like great musicians, great leaders don’t scatter their energy; they channel it.

2. Lead like Beyoncé: Excellence is in the details

Beyoncé’s legendary performances are the result of rigorous preparation. Every lighting cue, costume change and note is meticulously rehearsed. Yet what’s extraordinary is how her teams — backup dancers, musicians and crew reflect that same standard of excellence.

Leadership takeaway: Excellence doesn’t happen by accident; it’s engineered. A 2022 Gallup study showed that teams with clear goals and expectations outperform others by 20% in productivity and profitability.

What to do:

Set crystal-clear expectations for every project — objectives, roles and outcomes.

Prepare for critical meetings like Beyoncé preps for tour rehearsals: anticipate questions, align stakeholders and create backup plans.

Role-play difficult conversations with a coach or trusted colleague to fine-tune delivery.

Small details, rehearsed consistently, make the difference between a good performance and a standing ovation.

3. Improvise like Coltrane: Make space for innovation

John Coltrane’s improvisations weren’t chaotic — they were intentional explorations built atop the deep musical structure. Improvisation at its best is a profound act of listening, adapting and creating in real-time.

Leadership takeaway: In fast-paced industries, innovation doesn’t come from rigid planning—it comes from adaptive collaboration. Google’s Project Aristotle identified psychological safety and open idea-sharing as the top predictors of team success.

What to do:

Schedule “improv jams” once a month — open sessions where teams brainstorm ideas without judgment.

Rotate facilitators to avoid hierarchy dominating the room.

Celebrate wild ideas; iteration often comes after exploration.

When leaders create structured spaces for spontaneity, they unleash hidden creativity within their teams.

4. Collaborate like The Beatles: Harmony beats hierarchy

The Beatles weren’t just a collection of solo stars but a system of mutual amplification. Paul’s basslines supported John’s lyrics. Ringo’s drums filled George’s guitar riffs. Their magic came from synergy, not ego.

Leadership takeaway: Diversity of strengths fuels innovation — but only when collaboration is nurtured. McKinsey’s research shows that diverse teams are 35% more likely to outperform their peers in profitability, but only when there is intentional collaboration.

What to do:

Break down departmental silos with regular cross-functional “sectionals” short, problem-solving huddles across departments.

Assign team goals that can only be achieved through cross-unit collaboration.

Recognize and reward collaboration as much as individual achievement.

Harmony beats hierarchy every time — and the music you create together will be richer for it.

5. Reinvent like David Bowie: Stay relevant by evolving

David Bowie wasn’t afraid to evolve artistically or personally. He shifted personas, genres and styles while remaining undeniably himself. Reinvention wasn’t about abandoning identity but growing into new possibilities.

Leadership takeaway: Today’s world demands reinvention. The World Economic Forum predicts that 50% of all employees will need reskilling by 2025 to meet changing job requirements.

What to do:

Host quarterly “Retire, Refresh, Reimagine” workshops with your team.

Ask: What practices are outdated? What strengths should we amplify? What innovations should we chase?

Encourage career pathing and lateral moves that build skills outside narrow job roles.

Leaders who embrace reinvention model adaptability — and their teams follow suit.

6. Play the long game like Billie Eilish: Vulnerability builds trust

Billie Eilish broke into global fame by doing the unthinkable: leading with vulnerability. She ditched pop’s traditional polish for raw honesty — and millions resonated.

Leadership takeaway: Vulnerability isn’t weakness; it’s a catalyst for trust. According to research in Harvard Business Review, leaders who model vulnerability increase team learning behaviors and engagement by up to 30%.

What to do:

In team retrospectives, openly share lessons from mistakes or missteps.

Invite feedback about your leadership style — and act on it visibly.

Celebrate vulnerability in others: highlight when a team member shares a hard truth or admits a mistake.

When leaders are brave enough to be human, their teams become brave enough to innovate.

7. Think like an orchestra: Culture is the bass, strategy is the drums

The rhythm section — the bass and drums — sets the tone in any great band or orchestra. If the rhythm falters, no amount of brilliant solos can save the performance.

Leadership takeaway: Strategy (the plan) and culture (the human connection) must cohere. According to the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), toxic workplace cultures cost US businesses over $223 billion in turnover over five years.

What to do:

Conduct quarterly “culture check-ins” with your team.

Regularly assess whether strategy and culture are aligned, and course correct if not.

Remember: If the culture feels offbeat, even the best strategy will eventually collapse.

When strategy keeps tempo and culture provides groove, your team will not just deliver projects — they’ll deliver performances.

Build your leadership symphony

High-performing teams don’t happen by accident. They are composed, rehearsed and fine-tuned over time. As a leader, you’re not simply managing projects but orchestrating energy, emotion and execution.

Your team occasionally hits the wrong notes, like a great band or symphony. But if you keep the rhythm strong, foster trust, encourage creativity and lead authentically, you’ll create performances — and business outcomes — that stand the test of time.

So ask yourself: What music are you making with your team? And is it something worth listening to, growing with and celebrating every day?

Azure Sustainable Fuels Corp. is working in partnership with Tk’emlúps te Secwepemc to make the project a reality.

The facility would convert agricultural feedstocks, mainly canola, into Sustainable Aviation Fuel using a process called the Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids process.

The technology has been in commercial use and in operations for several years in many facilities around the world, including facilities in North America, Azure said in a written statement sent to iNFOnews.ca. The company is exploring multiple sites including Manitoba, Ontario and Kansas but they don't have any facilities in operation.

Already used by several airlines, the sustainable aviation fuel is approved for blending up to 50% with conventional jet fuel. In contrast to fossil fuels, the renewable fuel results in fewer carbon dioxide emissions.

In December 2024, a company called Parklands became the first in Canada to produce low carbon aviation fuel at its Burnaby Refinery, producing more than 100,000 litres that was purchased by Air Canada, according to Parkland's website.

The Azure plant is one part of the 7Mile District development project by Tk’emlúps te Secwepemc, that aims to turn a section of the reservation into an industrial park on one side and a solar powered agricultural area on the other.

The land sits between Highway 5 and the North Thompson River, and is divided in half by the CN rail yard.

The jet fuel plant would be built on a 71-hectare heavy industrial section and include storage tanks for feedstocks and products, process units for fuel production and utilities to support process units. According to the 7Mile District Master Plan, Azure is proposing to minimize the use of fossil fuels as an energy source for process operations, and use the train to transport feedstock.

The facility would produce roughly 20,000 barrels per day of renewable fuel, or up to 1 billion litres per year, providing for the reduction of up to 2,600,000 tonnes of CO2 annually, the master plan said. If the heavy industrial use plan proves to be unfeasible, either another industrial anchor might be chosen or a more locally focused, multi-business industrial park model built instead.

British Columbia has set a renewable fuel target for jet fuel at 1% starting in 2028 and increasing to 3% in 2030. Several countries around the world, including the United Kingdom and the European Union have set targets for minimum amount of sustainable aviation fuel requirements ranging from 2% in 2025 up to 70% in 2050, according to Azure.

The 7Mile Renewable Fuels Facility is currently undergoing community engagement, and regulatory and environmental review, and a final investment decision is expected in 2026.

Panelists at an American Medical Association webinar explored the challenges rural IPs face and the resources that can help them keep patients and health care workers safe.

Challenges around infection prevention training

A focus group led by Drs. Ylinne Lynch and Liza Rosenman of the Teaching Infection Prevention through Simulation team at the University of Washington found that many infection preventionists “fell” into the role due to administrative reasons and have a broad range of backgrounds, which can be a benefit. But they didn’t have the tools they needed to be successful. Some reported having to learn on the job, often with little institutional support, leaving them feeling overwhelmed.

Moreover, they reported difficulties getting infection prevention education to appropriate teams, due to misinformation, staff turnover or competing demands. Regardless, they have empathy for clinicians, understanding they face competing priorities, with one participant noting that clinicians are “just trying to get through caring for someone with a higher ratio than normal, and you’re trying to talk about hand hygiene.”

A separate assessment by infection preventionists and registered nurses Lauren Musil and Alisha Sheffield of the University of Nebraska Medical Center found similar challenges. More than 60% of infection preventionists said that they had infection prevention and control training, but only 44% felt it was adequate. On top of that, many have multiple roles, making it difficult to effectively do their job. However, infection preventionists report more job satisfaction if they have the support of hospital leadership, Musil said.

Lynch also touched on that. “I think what’s really hard about [infection prevention and control] is that when it’s done really well, the value’s a little bit invisible,” she said. “You can’t really easily measure the HAIs that are prevented.”

Resources for infection preventionists

The TIPS focus groups found that infection preventionists want more resources to support their efforts. Some participants noted that they needed to create culturally relevant materials or otherwise needed additional guidance to bolster and improve their infection prevention programs.

The IPC Support Center, described by Musil, aims to support such programs by providing tools for IPC education and practice. The center’s Self-led Infection Control Evaluation, or SLICE, tool allows rural and critical access acute care facilities to perform a self-evaluation of their infection prevention programs to identify areas for opportunity. Domains involve environmental cleaning, injection safety and critical device reprocessing, among others, providing resources and immediate summary reports. The center’s “Behind the Mask” webinar series corresponds to the SLICE tool, providing a way to ”reach hundreds of IPs instead of just one IP at a time to answer” pressing questions, Sheffield added.

Other resources within the IPC Support Center include the Extended Reality Education Program, created specifically for sterile processing workflows, giving users the opportunity to become familiar with them before stepping into a processing space. IPs can take advantage of the training by using a headset for an immersive experience, or through a laptop or tablet. The center also has a growing resource repository that includes checklists, audit forms and templates.

Local support

Another resource for IPs is their local Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology chapter, where they can connect with other professionals who have similar questions, Sheffield said. Local and state public health departments, as well as health care coalitions, also are resources that IPs can tap in to, and Musil noted that some departments offer office hours specifically for IPs, as well as webinars and infection prevention courses.

Sheffield had more advice for IPs in rural areas: Cold call IP professionals at other facilities to network and collaborate. She added that she has found success by putting herself out there and connecting with others in the field.

Results from the TIPS focus group support the idea of formal and informal networking. Participating IPs said they have shadowed IPs at other facilities and networked to learn how other professionals do their jobs and what worked for them, while others leaned on conferences, webinars and APIC resources.

“There’s lots of support within this community. Everybody’s rooting for one another,” Sheffield said.",https://www.smartbrief.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/infection-prevention-e1747245188960.png,N,,2025-05-14 21:56:12.754276

It is estimated that roughly 40% of the world's potential SAF feedstock will come from Asia-Pacific, particularly Southeast Asia.
Southeast Asia could produce 26 million tonnes of SAF per year, of which 5 million tonnes would come from Thailand, she said.
Energy conglomerates Bangchak and PTT Global Chemical have already begun SAF production.
SAF comprises less than 1% of global aviation fuel used today, but it should reach 6% by 2030, she said.","Airbus is banking on Southeast Asia becoming the world's top producer of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), while the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT) plans to mandate 1% SAF usage for European routes starting in the fourth quarter.

Julie Kitcher, chief sustainability officer at Airbus, said with SAF key to achieving its net-zero goal by 2050, she is optimistic about Thailand's prospects of becoming a global SAF producer and supplier.

SAF, also known as biofuel for aircraft, is a liquid fuel made of feedstock that can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% across the lifecycle, from production to usage.

It is estimated that roughly 40% of the world's potential SAF feedstock will come from Asia-Pacific, particularly Southeast Asia.

Southeast Asia could produce 26 million tonnes of SAF per year, of which 5 million tonnes would come from Thailand, she said.

Ms Kitcher said Thailand already has a strong agricultural sector with extensive feedstocks such as molasses, rice straw and rice husks.

Energy conglomerates Bangchak and PTT Global Chemical have already begun SAF production.

The decreased demand for bioethanol in Thai road transport due to the uptick in electric vehicles could free up space in production plants to produce more SAF, she said.

Ms Kitcher said Thailand's challenge is developing an in-depth feasibility study for different types of feedstocks, its location, accessibility as well as collection and transport costs.

In Thailand, the aviation sector contributed more than 7% of GDP before the pandemic, as more than 80% of inbound tourists arrived by air.

SAF comprises less than 1% of global aviation fuel used today, but it should reach 6% by 2030, she said.

The fuel costs 3-5 times more than kerosene, as it requires more investment in new projects to help reduce prices.

Ms Kitcher said policymakers should create schemes to help assure revenue for producers, which could help sustain the growth of SAF production, allowing them to confidently plan production 5-7 years ahead.

Airbus jets can be powered by up to 50% SAF blending and the company is also developing new aircraft to adopt a 100% SAF blend by 2030, she said.

ACM Manat Chavanaprayoon, director-general of the CAAT, said the authority is now in the final stage of gathering feedback in order to announce a regulation mandating SAF usage by Thai carriers, which should minimise the impact for airlines and passengers, and be ready by the end of this year.

Mr Manat said it plans to start with mandating a 1% SAF blend, as SAF today costs over three times more than jet A-1 fuel.

The 1% usage should not significantly affect airfares and would allow the CAAT to study its impact during the initial phase, he said.

This measure might be introduced on European routes first since the EU already mandated using a 2% blend of SAF at their airports and penalising airlines who fail to meet SAF blending requirements.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2025/05/14/5605196_700.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 19:56:47.253492

The draft legislation amends and extends the 45Z clean fuel production credit but repeals several other clean energy tax credits.
The existing 45Z tax credit, established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, provides a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transformation fuels.
“The SAF Coalition is grateful to the Ways & Means Committee for supporting the extension of the Clean Fuel Production Credit (45Z) through 2031,” Graab continued.
“The American Biogas Council applauds the House Ways and Means Committee for extending the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit in its reconciliation bill,” said Patrick Serfass, executive director of the ABC.","The House Ways and Means Committee on May 14 advanced its portion of President Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax bill. The draft legislation amends and extends the 45Z clean fuel production credit but repeals several other clean energy tax credits.

The existing 45Z tax credit, established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, provides a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transformation fuels. The credit starts at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit is up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. The tax credit is currently in place for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

Section 111112 of the draft legislation aims to limit availability of the 45Z credit to fuels produced from feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S. It also aims to exclude indirect land use change (ILUC) from being used to calculate the lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of eligible fuel and directs the U.S. Treasury Department to establish distinct emissions rates for specific manure feedstocks.

The draft bill would extend the 45Z credit through Dec. 31, 2031. Additional changes to the 45Z credit aim to eliminate transferability of the credit for fuel produced after Dec. 31, 2027, and restrict access to the credit for certain prohibited foreign entities.

The draft bill leaves the 45Q credit for carbon sequestration largely intact but aims to enact restrictions on transferability. Specifically, the legislation would repeal transferability for carbon capture equipment where construction begins two years after the bill’s date of enactment. It also restricts access to the credit for certain prohibited foreign entities.

While the draft bill updates and extends the 45Z tax credit and leaves the 45Q credit mostly unchanged, it also aims to repeal and scale back numerous other clean energy tax credits, including the clean hydrogen tax credit and the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit.

The alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit allows taxpayers to claim a tax credit for advanced refueling property placed in service during a give tax year, including property used to dispense E85, biodiesel blends of B20 or greater, natural gas, hydrogen, propane, and electricity. The credit value is 30% of the cost of the property, up to $100,000. The credit is currently scheduled to retire on Dec. 31, 2032. The draft bill would accelerate the sunset date of the credit to Dec. 31, 2025.

The bill also aims to terminate the clean hydrogen production tax credit, which was established by the IRA and allows taxpayers to claim a credit per kilogram of qualified clean hydrogen produced for sale or use. The credit is based on GHG emission ate of the production process, with a value of up to 60 cents per kilogram. The clean hydrogen tax credit is currently available for facilities that commence construction before Jan. 1, 2033. The draft bill would accelerate the expiration of the credit to facilities the construction of which begins after Dec. 32, 2025.

Another section of the draft bill aims to phase-out a credit that supports the installation of residential wood heating appliances. The legislation would terminate the energy efficient home improvement credit, which currently allows taxpayers to claim a tax credit for household energy efficiency improvements. The value of the credit is 30% of qualified expenses, up to $1,200 annually, or $2,000 for heat pumps and biomass stoves. The credit is currently set to expire on Dec. 31, 2032. The draft bill would accelerate the expiration to Dec. 31, 2025.

In addition, the draft bill seeks to phase out the production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) for clean electricity. The credits are not currently set to expire. The draft bill, however, aims to phase out the credit by reducing the value of the credit by 20% for facilities placed into service after 2029, by 40% for facilities placed into service in 2030, and 60% for facilities placed into service 2031. No credit would be available for facilities placed into service after 2031. Bill provisions also eliminate transferability of the credit and restrict access to the credit for certain prohibited foreign entities.

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAC) Coalition has spoken out in support of the bill’s 45Z provisions. “Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a key solution for strengthening U.S. energy dominance, driving investment in rural economies and positioning the United States as a global leader in SAF production,” said Alison Graab, executive director of the SAF Coalition.

“The SAF Coalition is grateful to the Ways & Means Committee for supporting the extension of the Clean Fuel Production Credit (45Z) through 2031,” Graab continued. “This critical legislation provides long-term certainty for SAF producers, incentivizes private sector investment, and builds out a robust domestic supply chain. The bill ensures that 45Z delivers direct benefits to U.S. farmers and rural economies.

“We urge Congress to pass this extension to reinforce our energy dominance and unleash the full economic potential of America’s heartland.”

The American Biogas Council is also applauding extension of the 45Z credit. “The American Biogas Council applauds the House Ways and Means Committee for extending the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit in its reconciliation bill,” said Patrick Serfass, executive director of the ABC. “This is a critical step toward supporting reliable renewable fuels like biogas that reduce air and water pollution, create American-made energy, and drive rural economic development. The extension of 45Z ensures continued momentum for investment in biogas systems that turn organic waste into clean energy—benefiting communities, farmers, and rural economies.”

Brian Jennings with the American Coalition for Ethanol tells Brownfield the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements that were tied to most of the Biden era tax credits including 45Z are not feasible. “Potentially, include either an improvement to that prevailing wage and apprenticeship language or eliminating that requirement alltogether. That’s a conversation we’ll be having with the House and with the Senate.”

Geoff Cooper with the Renewable Fuels Association agrees and says he would also like to see the transferability of the credit go beyond 2027 to help smaller producers. He says the bill also doesn’t allow ethanol producers to benefit from conservation practices on the farm as part of the carbon intensity scoring. “And therefore, there’s really no way for ethanol producers to reward farmers for those practices through the existing structure of this tax credit.”

Cooper is hoping these issues can be addressed in the House Budget Committee or in the Senate before the bill is finalized.

Jennings says if the 45Z tax credits are available, ethanol companies are ready to innovate and take advantage of them, but he wonders if the value of the credit will be enough to get sustainable aviation fuel production off the ground because of the extra refinement needed.

The 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit is one of the few tax policies House Republicans kept from the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act. As written, the credit would extend to 2031.

On 1 January 2025, the UK’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate came into force, which requires the flight sector to supplant 2% of its jet fuel demand with SAF in flights taking off from the UK from 2025. This will grow year-on-year to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.

Made from sustainable sources, including materials such as household waste or used cooking oil, SAF is considered a major tool in helping to lower climate change emissions from air travel – widely regarded as one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise.

SAF can be used in existing aircraft, and it emits on average 70% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than using fossil jet fuel on a life-cycle basis.

A recent study found that emissions from European airlines have soared to pre-Covid-19 levels .

However, a key challenge for airlines meeting this mandate and using SAF in their aircraft is that there is simply not enough of it. Lufthansa and British Airways have already said that switching to cleaner, more expensive sustainable fuel will drive up ticket prices . Air New Zealand also announced it is dropping its 2030 goal to cut carbon emissions because of difficulties in procuring new planes and SAF.

Aware of the challenge of scaling SAF production to meet the mandate while keeping costs low, the government said in January that it would introduce a revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) for SAF producers to attract investment in new plants in the UK.

This RCM has now been introduced in parliament. The DfT said this RCM will keep ticket price changes minimal – a fluctuation of around £1.50 a year – and will be industry-funded through a levy on aviation fuel suppliers.

The DfT said it will continue to engage with industry on the details of the RCM, including pricing.

It also announced an additional £400,000 to enable SAF producers to get new clean fuels to market quicker. This funding will be used to support the testing and qualification of these green fuels.

It follows £63m allocated through the Advanced Fuels Fund in January 2025 to support UK SAF production.

Mike Kane, aviation minister, said: “Aviation continues to be one of the fastest growing and most integral parts of the UK’s economy, offering more jobs across engineering, tourism and hospitality – and as we support aviation expansion, we need to move at full throttle towards decarbonisation.”

Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, said: “We look forward to working with government on scheme design and how contracts are allocated, so that we balance the need to deliver the SAF required to support mandate compliance, whilst keeping costs as low as possible through a competitive and transparent bidding process that places the consumer at its heart.”

While the government wants the UK to be a global hub for SAF production, there is concern about where the feedstocks for this production will come from. In 2023, a study by the Royal Society found that the transition to SAF would require the use of 50% of the UK's agricultural land .

Meanwhile, some aircraft producers are working on other means of decarbonising aviation. In March 2025, Airbus said its dedication to hydrogen-powered flight remains “unwavering” .",https://eandt.theiet.org/sites/default/files/styles/uncropped_small/public/2025-05/web_refueling-airplane-airport-ground-service-before_Credit_Jaromir-Chalabala_shutterstock_2191982235_1600x900.png?itok=EVVeuaZO,N,,2025-05-14 15:57:56.117853

For example, The Erawan Group provides its used hotel oil to be recycled into SAF in Asia.

""Sustainable fuel is the single biggest game-changer for Travel & Tourism, but right now, supply falls dangerously short of demand,” said Julia Simpson, WTTC President & CEO. “If we don’t act together, we risk rising costs, limited availability, and stalled climate progress.”

“Every hotel, tour operator, travel agency, cruise line and airline has a role to play,” she continued. “This framework gives them the blueprint. Sustainable fuel is not just an environmental necessity; it’s a business imperative and governments must incentivise the production of SAF, not just set targets for the sector.”

Though stumbling blocks remain, on the bright side, the industry has seen continued innovation in terms of sustainability initiatives. For a deeper look ahead, we tapped multiple aviation experts for an exploration of private aviation trends and challenges for 2025 and beyond.

Doug Gollan is president and founder of Private Jet Card Comparisons, a data-based buyers guide to jet cards, memberships and fractional ownership programs. He notes, “The industry enters 2025 coming off its third-best year ever in terms of flying with a strong end-of-year surge. Private Jet Card Comparisons subscribers project they will fly 42.7 hours in the next 12 months, up from 42.4 hours the year before. What’s more, 95.4 percent of the consumers who started flying since the Covid pandemic have stayed with private aviation, demonstrating that it’s a product customers like, and once they try it on a regular basis, come back for more.”

Jamie Walker, Chairman of Jet Linx, states, “the industry has found new footing after the seesaw of demand and rising costs from previous years.” Gregg Brunson-Pitts, founder and CEO of Advanced Aviation Team, continues, “Private aviation is thriving as more individuals and businesses recognize the value of flexible, time-saving travel solutions. While demand has leveled off after the post-pandemic surge, our clients today are more sophisticated and selective, placing a higher premium on comfort, personalization and overall experience. It’s no longer just about getting from point A to point B—it’s about creating a seamless, luxury journey that caters to every detail, from ground services to in-flight amenities.”

David McCown, president of the Americas for global aircraft charter specialist Chapman Freeborn, adds, “While globally, the outlook is varied, in the US the trend is clearly positive. In the charter market, we see growing year-over-year demand . . . January year-over-year departures for Chapman Freeborn in the US are trending above industry, up over 20 percent, and we see solid trip requests for future travel even into the summer months.”

Sustainability at the Forefront

As with travel as a whole, sustainability is a key trend to focus on moving ahead. “The continued rollout of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is likely the biggest thing to watch in 2025 due to the progress made last year. There is a lot of positive momentum to continue pushing this important initiative to the forefront,” shares Walker of Jet Linx. Brunson-Pitts agrees, adding, “Sustainability remains front and center, with more clients asking about carbon offsets and sustainable aviation fuel, which is becoming more widely available, including at key airports like Teterboro (TEB) and Washington Dulles (IAD).” He says, “Operators and FBOs are steadily integrating greener solutions into their operations, and the industry is moving toward a future where sustainability isn’t just a luxury—it’s the new standard.”

McCown shares, “Regarding sustainability, the US withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement should not hinder aviation’s progress towards a sustainable future. Many Global (non-US) companies who [operate] within the US still have emissions reduction targets to meet which will require the same amount of focus from US-based operators and businesses.” According to McCown, this includes advancing alternative aviation fuel production, using sustainable fuels and developing aircraft and engines compatible with these initiatives. “Globally, the industry’s push for emission reductions should drive innovation, create value and generate employment opportunities both in the US and worldwide,” he says.

Gollan notes that in his experience, it’s the industry advancing the sustainable initiative rather than the consumer. “While sustainability continues to be a major push from the industry side, only 29.2 percent of Private Jet Card Comparisons subscribers say these programs will factor into the next time they choose a provider, so from a consumer point of view, changes to program policies and rules will continue to be the most important factors,” he explains.

Popular Aircraft

In terms of what private aviation travelers want for 2025 and beyond, there’s lots to report. “We’re seeing increased demand for larger cabin aircraft, particularly for longer international trips. Clients are prioritizing space and comfort, with a focus on the ability to work, relax and connect with family or colleagues seamlessly while in the air,” says Brunson-Pitts. He adds, “At the same time, new aircraft like the Gulfstream G700 are entering the market, creating a ripple effect on the availability of older-generation jets like the G650 and G550. Looking ahead, the expected certification of the Bombardier Global 8000 this year and the Falcon 10X in 2027 will further expand options for travelers seeking the latest in performance and luxury.”

Jet Linx data post pandemic shows the same trend. “From 2020 to 2025, we’ve seen light jet flights drop by 22 percent, while super midsize grew by 41 percent and heavy jet grew by 184 percent. Midsize jet flights have remained flat. International flights grew by a combined 76 percent across all size categories since 2020,” Walker shares.

Gollan notes that for fractional ownership and jet card users, it’s often about being able to stand up in the plane’s cabin if you are tall. “There is a lot of interest in seeing a dedicated Praetor 500 card to cover the midsize segment—but to this point, we’re still waiting. Challenger 300 series is very popular for the super-midsize segment. Both cabins are six feet high,” the Private Jet Card Comparison founder shares.

Chapman Freeborn’s McCown states, “we are seeing a demand trend towards newer aircraft, in part due to the perception that they are safer [and] more reliable (incurring fewer mechanicals).” He also notes that customers are increasingly looking for larger business aircraft, even for shorter trips, sharing that, “Phenom 300s are a favorite, and Citation Latitudes/Longitudes and Embraer Praetors are becoming increasingly popular.”

Challenges

As is true almost across the board, rising costs continue to affect the private aviation industry. These higher costs have pushed a segment of users out of the marketplace, according to Walker. “Therefore, demand isn’t as robust as it should be with a growing economy and the bull market results of 2024,” he concludes. “Going into 2025, the industry will continue to consolidate due to the challenges of higher costs, a shortage of talent and soft demand. These challenges are compounded for the smaller companies who haven’t yet reached the economies of scale needed to weather the current marketplace,” Walker explains. “New technology will continue to help the industry find greater efficiencies, but not at a rate quick enough to improve earnings or lower costs for the end users,” he adds.

Gollan points to supply chain interruption as another core issue facing private aviation today. “This has made it more difficult for operators, particularly regarding older aircraft where there are still shortages of parts, which means aircraft are on the ground longer. With pricing stabilizing, operators will also see margins squeezed as they deal with increased costs from pilot and general wages to various fees,” he says.

But on the whole, there’s still much to look forward to in terms of private aviation. “Our industry continues to evolve to meet the needs of a more diverse client base. While business and corporate travel remain a core driver, particularly for privacy and security purposes, we’re seeing more families and individuals choosing private jets for leisure travel—whether to explore remote destinations that are hard to reach or to avoid the unpredictability of commercial air travel,” shares Brunson-Pitts. “It’s ultimately about creating an experience that prioritizes convenience, safety and time efficiency,”",https://www.jetsetmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Falcon10X_GAL_212_202302.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 15:58:06.398658

There are currently seven approved pathways for producing SAF, with an eighth — eSAF — emerging as a key long-term solution:

HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids)

Produced from waste oils and fats. Commercially established, easy to scale, and can be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel.

Fischer-Tropsch (FT-SPK)

Converts solid biomass or waste into syngas, which is then converted into fuel. Technically proven but capital-intensive and best suited for large-scale infrastructure.

Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ)

Converts ethanol or isobutanol (from sugars or waste) into jet fuel. Suitable for regions with abundant agricultural feedstocks. Approved for blending up to 50%.

CHJ (Catalytic Hydrothermolysis Jet)

Processes lipids through hydrothermal upgrading. Certified and under active development.

HFS-SIP (Fermented Sugars to Iso-Paraffins)

Uses engineered yeast to convert sugars into jet fuel. Approved but limited to 10% blending due to fuel composition.

FT-SPK/A

A Fischer-Tropsch variant that includes aromatics to better match jet fuel standards. Recently certified.

HC-HEFA

Derived from algae and other novel lipid sources.

eSAF

Emerging as a long-term solution, electrofuels such as eKerosene are produced using renewable electricity to generate hydrogen, which is then combined with captured CO₂ to create a sustainable, carbon-neutral fuel.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) refers to a range of bio-based and synthetic fuels that reduce carbon emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. SAF can be produced through various pathways, such as HEFA, Fischer-Tropsch, or Alcohol-to-Jet.

eSAF (electrofuels) is a subset of SAF produced using renewable electricity, typically by combining captured CO₂ with renewable hydrogen to create synthetic fuels like eKerosene. eSAF is considered a long-term, scalable solution for the aviation sector, offering an additional route to decarbonization that relies on renewable energy and carbon capture technologies.

eKerosene is considered sustainable because it is produced using renewable hydrogen and captured CO₂, making it a carbon-neutral fuel. The production of eKerosene significantly reduces lifecycle emissions compared to conventional jet fuel, which helps meet global net-zero targets. As a drop-in fuel, eKerosene can be blended with existing jet fuel, allowing the aviation sector to reduce its carbon footprint while continuing normal operations without the need for major infrastructure changes. Furthermore, eKerosene supports the transition to sustainable aviation by offering a renewable alternative that can scale with the growing demand for low-emission fuels.

The Methanol-to-Jet (MtJ) process is a two-step method used to produce eKerosene. In the first step, eMethanol is converted into long-chain olefinic hydrocarbons through the Methanol-to-Olefins (MtO) process. Next, in the Olefins-to-Jet (OtJ) process, these olefins undergo hydroprocessing to produce jet fuel isomers, yielding a jet fuel fraction (approximately 80% by weight), as well as naphtha and offgas.

What makes MtJ flexible is its modular and scalable nature, as it can be implemented in smaller, decentralized plants that use liquid eMethanol as a feedstock. This flexibility offers advantages in logistics and distribution, allowing for easier integration into existing infrastructure compared to more centralized methods like Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.

The Methanol-to-Jet (MtJ) process can use both fossil methanol and eMethanol as feedstocks. However, eMethanol is typically preferred in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production because it is renewable and fossil-free. eMethanol is produced from captured CO₂ and renewable hydrogen, which makes it a key component in producing eKerosene with a much lower carbon footprint compared to conventional methanol derived from fossil fuels. Using eMethanol ensures that the resulting eKerosene is carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative, contributing to more sustainable aviation practices.

Fischer-Tropsch synthesis requires syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) as a feedstock, which must be produced through gasification of coal, natural gas, or biomass. This process typically requires large, centralized facilities, making it more complex and capital-intensive. In contrast, the Methanol-to-Jet (MtJ) process uses liquid methanol, which can be produced from renewable sources like CO₂ and green hydrogen. This enables the establishment of smaller, more flexible, and distributed production plants, reducing infrastructure costs and simplifying logistics.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e8dd7bd5994173d6a216b14/t/5ec2e39f3dae1216502b0c9d/1589830576965/LiquidWind_socialsharing.png?format=1500w,N,,2025-05-14 17:56:40.483996

Daniel Galpin, ICF Managing Director, stated “Decarbonising transport is a crucial step towards achieving a sustainable tourism sector.
In conclusion, the WTTC-ICF framework provides a comprehensive and actionable blueprint for the Travel and Tourism sector to unite behind sustainable aviation and marine fuels.","The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), in partnership with the global consultancy firm ICF, has unveiled a groundbreaking new framework aimed at transforming the Travel and Tourism sector’s approach to sustainability. The initiative targets one of the industry’s most pressing challenges: dramatically increasing the production and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other renewable fuels to significantly reduce transport-related carbon emissions. This ambitious plan marks a decisive step forward in accelerating the transition to cleaner, more sustainable energy sources within a sector that plays a vital role in the global economy.

Currently, Sustainable Aviation Fuel accounts for a mere 0.3 percent of global jet fuel consumption, a figure that starkly highlights the urgency for rapid change. To align with the global goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, SAF production must surge by more than four hundred times, escalating from just over one billion two hundred fifty million litres today to a staggering 450 billion litres annually. Achieving this level of supply will require the construction of approximately six thousand five hundred new renewable fuel production plants scattered across the globe. The challenges faced by SAF are mirrored in the marine sector, where Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF) also grapples with limited supply capacity and infrastructure.

Julia Simpson, WTTC President & CEO, said “Sustainable fuel is the single biggest game-changer for Travel & Tourism, but right now, supply falls dangerously short of demand. If we don’t act together, we risk rising costs, limited availability, and stalled climate progress.

“Every hotel, tour operator, travel agency, cruise line and airline has a role to play. This framework gives them the blueprint. Sustainable fuel is not just an environmental necessity; it’s a business imperative and governments must incentivise the production of SAF, not just set targets for the sector.”

What makes Sustainable Aviation Fuel uniquely promising compared to other decarbonisation technologies is its compatibility with existing aircraft engines and fuel systems, a characteristic known as being a “drop-in” solution. This means that SAF can be integrated into current aviation operations without requiring costly modifications or replacements of existing fleets. However, the road to widespread adoption is obstructed by several critical barriers. High production costs, insufficient infrastructure for fuel distribution, and intense competition for sustainable feedstocks have all contributed to keeping SAF volumes low and prices exceptionally high — sometimes up to ten times greater than conventional jet fuel.

The new framework developed by WTTC and ICF offers a clear and practical roadmap tailored to engage every business within the Travel and Tourism ecosystem, regardless of its size or specific role. It categorises stakeholders into four distinct groups: Collaborators, Promoters, Adopters, and Investors. This tiered approach provides actionable steps for each group to contribute meaningfully. For example, businesses can participate by joining global sustainability campaigns, supplying waste products suitable for fuel production, investing capital into new production facilities, or committing to purchase sustainable fuel certificates. The framework leaves no doubt that every business has a vital part to play in driving this transformation.

Real-world examples highlighted in the report demonstrate that momentum is already building within the industry. In Asia, the Erawan Group has pioneered the conversion of waste oil from its hotel operations into Sustainable Aviation Fuel, showcasing an innovative approach to resource utilisation. Similarly, Jet2, a leading UK airline, has taken a bold step by investing in a domestic SAF plant that uses recyclable household waste as feedstock. These case studies serve as proof points that sustainable fuel initiatives are not just theoretical ideas but are actively shaping the future of travel.

Daniel Galpin, ICF Managing Director, stated “Decarbonising transport is a crucial step towards achieving a sustainable tourism sector. While transport industries, particularly aviation with its focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), have recognised the importance of sustainable fuels and are couragesouly working towards a new era, there remains a significant journey ahead. It is essential for the broader tourism ecosystem to take action and provide support to meet the targets set, as well as to implement both operational and strategic changes required.

“ICF is proud to have collaborated closely with WTTC to identify the roles that tourism stakeholders can adopt and the actions they can take to facilitate the decarbonisation of the sector, thereby contributing to a more sustainable future.”

The report also underscores a crucial warning: failure to act collectively and swiftly could lead to unintended economic consequences. Governments around the world are moving toward implementing SAF mandates, requiring fuel blends containing five to ten percent sustainable content by the year 2030. Without adequate industry-wide engagement, these mandates risk driving up travel costs and restricting consumer options, which could hamper demand for air travel and negatively impact the broader economy.

This issue carries immense economic weight, as the Travel and Tourism sector is projected to generate sixteen and a half trillion dollars in revenue and support over four hundred sixty million jobs globally by 2035. Scaling up sustainable fuels is therefore not only an environmental necessity but also an economic imperative. The industry’s ability to meet ambitious climate goals while sustaining growth depends heavily on embracing and accelerating the use of SAF and other renewable alternatives.

In conclusion, the WTTC-ICF framework provides a comprehensive and actionable blueprint for the Travel and Tourism sector to unite behind sustainable aviation and marine fuels. By fostering collaboration, encouraging investment, and promoting adoption at every level, the sector can overcome existing barriers and lead the way toward a cleaner, greener future. The time to act is now — the environmental health of the planet, the vitality of the global economy, and the future of travel depend on it.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WTTC-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 14:56:36.281150

The new American Express Business Travel feature will help managers find viable rail alternatives when available, pick more carbon-efficient flights, choose carbon-efficient cabin classes, and opt for flights using sustainable aviation fuel.

The new tool follows on the heels of the launch of Amex GBT's carbon pricing features.

This is all made available through Amex's Egencia travel management platform. The system already allows travel managers to find electric rental vehicles and hotels that have third-party sustainability verification.

""In addition to having a competitive marketplace that gives them the best choices of content and prices, we're also making it easier for them and their employees to make better choices.""

Choosing low-impact travel is an important part of minimizing weather extremes, arctic sea ice loss, oceanic warming, and sea level rise. Aviation alone accounts for about 2.5% of global global carbon dioxide pollution.

All of the new measures Egencia is employing have shown promise.

Airports are now supporting the use of sustainable aviation fuels, some of which can be 80% cleaner than traditional jet fuel. Rail is a much cleaner option than flying, especially versus short-haul flights.

First-class passengers eat up a larger proportion of a flight's carbon footprint by sheer virtue of the amount of space they take up.

SAF production has been disappointingly slow to scale up, in part due to the complex and costly investments needed to get facilities off the ground. The ambition of the UK policy is to de-risk the private investment needed and subsequently propel this nascent industry forward. The policy, termed a revenue certainty mechanism (RCM), ensures producers a guaranteed level of revenue as the market matures. This sort of scheme is not new—it has worked well in establishing an offshore wind sector for the UK—but is new for SAF production. The UK government is proposing the industry (in fact mainly the airlines) fund the scheme, adding additional layers of cost to a sector already exposed to incredibly high SAF pricing.

What are the key issues airlines and IATA are prioritizing in the UK when it comes to SAF?

A fair price for SAF, transparency around the pricing from suppliers and a means to scale up domestic production.

Where needed, policy intervention to correct a market failure.

An incentive scheme for SAF production in the UK that does not add to existing pressure on airlines finances.

Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Officer at International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of British Airways, explains further …

What is the latest on SAF?

The UK SAF mandate started this year and initially requires 2% of all aviation fuel supplied in the UK to be SAF, ramping up to 10% by 2030. The EU has a similar mandate, with a 2% requirement in 2025 but their mandate is for 6% by 2030.

A large amount of SAF is currently produced in the US where incentive schemes through tax credits have bolstered investments, while in the UK there is one facility today producing commercial volumes of SAF and plans for test facilities that can scale up in the next five years. In 2024, SAF production volumes reached 1 million tonnes (1.3 billion litres), double the 0.5 million tonnes (600 million litres) produced in 2023. SAF accounted for 0.3% of global jet fuel production and 11% of global renewable fuel.

Are the mandates working?

SAF is key to the aviation sector meeting its Net Zero CO2 emissions by 2050 commitment, IATA anticipates 65% of the decarbonization will come from the use of SAF. But we are facing challenges – SAF under the mandate is more expensive than anticipated and European airlines are therefore paying far more than other operators to fly as all our flights are subject to the mandate – whether it be in the UK or EU. Governments in Europe have legislated for SAF use through mandates, before essential production incentives have kicked in.

Stimulating supply is important – it will ensure airlines can maximize the use of SAF and abate CO2 emissions quicker, but also will keep prices down. Airlines are currently paying on average ~ 3 to 5 times more for SAF over traditional jet fuel, which is far higher than anticipated when the policy was designed. It seems the suppliers are simply passing on their obligations under the mandate to the airlines via compliance fees, and there is a significant gap between SAF market prices and the real cost of SAF airlines are facing at airports, which is a lose-lose for both airlines and consumers.

What can be done to speed up production?

The development of a UK SAF industry is vital to bring scale of SAF locally, so we’re not importing all our sustainable fuel to meet mandates. Our focus is the incentive mechanism, known as the Revenue Certainty Mechanism (RCM), which will guarantee the pricing structure for producers. While we’re fully supportive of an RCM, the decision about who pays for the mechanism is worrying airlines.

Under current proposals, airlines and their suppliers could end up paying even more to fund the new SAF plants. We must ensure new proposals are not at the expense of keeping air travel affordable and accessible when aviation drives billions of pounds of economic value (GVA – Gross valued Added) and supports hundreds of thousands of jobs across the economy. Fuel bills are typically up to a third of an airline’s costs, and in the UK, we already pay significantly higher costs than our competitors with Air Passenger Duty, higher airport charges and business rates, and carbon charges through the UK Emissions Trading System.

We believe there is a different way to fund the RCM: using the aviation industry’s contribution into the UK Emissions Trading System. The UK ETS was set up in 2021 as a way to reduce CO2 emissions from heavy industries and is paid into by firms in energy-intensive sectors - including aviation. It’s estimated there will be ample contribution to the Treasury over the coming 10 years from aviation ETS - around £1 billion to £4 billion. This funding could be used for SAF projects which is entirely consistent with the original purpose of the scheme. Indeed, in the EU, ETS funds are recycled to provide SAF allowances to contribute to the price difference between SAF and kerosene and support the Innovation Fund[1] which backs projects for the innovation of low-carbon technologies.",https://www.iata.org/contentassets/9c75d7065f6f44e5946f36ab6c32ad29/big-ben.png,N,,2025-05-14 18:56:08.496152

Sustainable Supersonic Jets: A Farce or Achievable?
| SAF – Sustainable Aviation Fuel Could Make Flying Greener Soon | Clean Skies Ahead?
Unlike Concorde, today’s supersonic jets are being designed with sustainability, efficiency, and digital optimization in mind.
Supersonic jets have marked a return, not just in engineering labs and factories, but in the public imagination.","Nearly 70 years after the Supersonic Transport Aircraft Committee formed and began investigating the potential of supersonic jets, a new wave of designs is emerging; will the models-in-the-making today ensure or impede the aspirations for sustainable aviation?

Earlier this year, American Boom Supersonic’s experimental jet XB-1 broke the sound barrier, reaching the speed of Mach 1.122. Lifting off from California’s Mojave Air & Space Port, the moment echoed the historic accomplishment of the Bell X-1, which flew in the same location in 1947, flying faster than Mach 1 for the first time in human history.

Marking renewed ambitions to bring supersonic flight back to commercial airlines, promises of great speed have raised significant questions about their environmental impact. Over two decades since the legendary Concorde made its last flight, the question remains: will its successors overcome the issues that led to its retirement?

The New Contenders

The supersonic race of the Cold War era was defined by three major contenders: the USA’s Boeing 2707, the USSR’s Tupolev Tu-144, and the UK-France’s Concorde. Among them, only Concorde succeeded in entering the commercial market. Today, contenders in a supersonic resurgence race include Boom Supersonic (USA), Comac (China), and Venus Aerospace (USA), chasing ambitions to re-establish super-fast air travel, this time for good.

Founded in 2014 by CEO Blake Scholl in an Oakland basement, Boom is now leading the commercial supersonic charge with its flagship project: Overture. The company’s use of computational fluid dynamics testing for the XB-1 model — a prototype of Overture — has led to a substantial reduction in development costs.

“We can run the equivalent of hundreds of wind tunnel tests overnight in simulation for a fraction of the cost of a real wind test,” Scholl stated.

Set to enter service in 2029, the Overture already has 130 orders from American Airlines, United Airlines, and Japan Airlines. Boom opened its superfactory last year, and it is estimated that it will be manufacturing 66 Overtures annually. Signalling its commitment “to build sustainability into its entire aircraft program,” Boom’s bespoke propulsion system, Symphony, has been designed to run entirely on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

However, with supersonic jets requiring significantly more fuel than subsonic and SAF representing only 0.5% of jet fuel currently used due to its scarce and expensive production, such aims could be deemed overambitious, at least for now.

Across the Pacific, China’s Comac is developing its supersonic vision as well; its C949 jet is projected to reach speeds of Mach 2.04, surpassing Overture’s 1.7. Compared to Concorde, the C949 jet promises a 50% greater range (6,800 miles) and a 95% reduction in noise.

Comac’s innovations to combat pollution reportedly include a “shape-shifting” fuselage to reduce sonic booms and noise disruption, and AI-driven aerodynamics to maximize fuel efficiency. With a debut planned for 2049, C949 represents a longer-term strategy to lead in both speed and sustainability.

Then, something of a hybrid between a rocket and an aircraft comes Venus Aerospace‘s hypersonic Stargazer M4 jet — a science-fiction fantasy hoping to become a reality. The jet will target speeds of Mach 4 — and potentially Mach 9 — with a top cruising altitude at the edge of space: the Karman line.

Powered by an innovative rotating detonation rocket engine, a next-generation propulsion system that Venus claims is both more powerful and more fuel-efficient, the Stargazer has attracted support from NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense. If successful, it could redefine commercial air travel by the 2030s.

Sustainable Supersonic Jets: A Farce or Achievable?

While the resurgence of supersonic travel is stirring excitement, it is accompanied by a chorus of concern. Supersonic jets burn significantly more fuel per passenger than subsonic ones. According to estimates, each passenger seat in Overture’s 64–80 capacity aircraft will use 2 to 3 times more fuel than a standard business/first class cabin.

Thus, the promised affordability of supersonic flights is called into question. Will they repeat the Concorde’s financially unsustainable exclusivity or revolutionise the aviation industry?

Moreover, as supersonic jets cruise at higher altitudes — well into the stratosphere — emissions such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and water vapour may have more serious implications for ozone depletion and radiative forcing. However, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), assessment of the environmental impact of modern supersonic civilian aircraft is limited; with none currently in operation, data is insufficient.

Beyond emissions volume and fuel type (traditional jet fuel or SAF), the factors affecting a jet’s climatic impact and fuel efficiency include fleet size, aircraft technology, speed, and flight path.

SAF, often hailed as a solution to aviation’s CO₂ emissions, may currently be out of reach as a saving grace. Derived from biomass, recycled materials, and even captured carbon, SAF remains scarce and expensive at present. But international investment is growing, with efforts focused on innovation and scaling up production.

The EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, for example, aims to increase the share of SAF at European airports from just 2% in 2025 to 70% by 2050 — an ambitious target that, if met, could significantly reshape aviation’s climate footprint.

Lessons from Concorde

The shadow of Concorde still looms over the industry. A technological marvel when it entered the industry in 1976 with British Airways and Air France, one problem after another led to its retirement in 2003. High operational and maintenance costs undercut its appeal; the noise pollution made it impractical for overland routes; its engines were inefficient by modern standards; mounting environmental and safety concerns further eroded public support, and eventually, demand waned.

Unlike Concorde, today’s supersonic jets are being designed with sustainability, efficiency, and digital optimization in mind. Boom’s engineers have developed an airframe made of carbon fiber composites, which are both lighter and stronger than traditional metals. In theory, this could lead to a significant reduction in fuel burn.

Aiming to make supersonic travel viable over land, both Boom and Comac are working to reduce noise levels of supersonic jets, seeking to avoid the glass-shattering sonic booms that once confined Concorde to transoceanic routes. In parallel, NASA is researching low-boom technologies to create less disruptive shockwaves. Comac may win the gold medal if it succeeds in making C949’s “noise level like a blowing hairdryer” as the company claims it could.

Yet, even with all the promises of greener technology and quieter skies, the same fundamental challenge remains: is there a viable market for supersonic travel that is both profitable and sustainable? If so, will it extend beyond the global elite?

Between 1990 and 2019, aviation made major strides in energy efficiency, cutting the fuel required per passenger-kilometre from 2.9 megajoules (MJ) to 1.3. However, with flight demand quadrupling over the same period, aviation’s emissions increased overall. Even if the promises of improved efficiency and eventual affordability are met, will large increases in demand, particularly for intercontinental travel requiring more fuel, lead to greater environmental impact?

Looking to the Future: Aviation’s Race to Decarbonise

Commercial aviation accounts for roughly 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions, but its total impact on warming is closer to 4%, factoring in non-CO₂ pollutants and contrails. Across the board, aviation’s survival in a carbon-conscious world depends on scaling up SAF, electrifying regional aircraft, and developing new propulsion systems — from hydrogen to hybrid-electric.

With international commitment being promoted by the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation’s initiatives and ICAO to avoid patchy progress and uneven regulation, a more sustainable supersonic future in aviation may be achievable through international cooperation.

However, as alluring as futuristic supersonic — nay, hypersonic — flight may be, pouring billions into ultra-fast jets might be a high-stakes gamble, especially for what could prove to be a niche market or a repeat of Concorde’s costly missteps. Critics may argue that such investment may be premature, potentially diverting resources from more scalable green innovations — technologies that could offer a more reliable path toward sustainable progress in aviation.

Supersonic jets have marked a return, not just in engineering labs and factories, but in the public imagination. Driven by a blend of nostalgia, innovation, and national pride, the motivations of the sixties persist; nevertheless, the world they enter is greatly different from the one when Concorde first appeared. Greater dedication to environmental targets, stronger public scrutiny, and larger equity concerns cast long shadows across their glossy fuselages.

Will it be Boom, Comac, or Venus to reel in a new golden age of flight — speedier, cleaner, smarter — or an unsuspecting underdog? Or will the perpetuity of innovation be sacrificed for a quick spectacle, ushering in another hiatus to realising a science-fiction fantasy?",https://impakter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/XB-1_FT07-2-e1747235827441.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 12:57:46.267397

“We have the engine design; we have the integration plans for the launch airframe; we have the solutions to provide the hydrogen fuel; and we have the customers wanting to operate the first routes. We now need to double our attention on the certification testing that will get this route flying and then ramp up production for our other confirmed ZA600 customers,” Val Miftakhov, ZeroAvia’s founder and CEO, said in a press release announcing the deal.

The entrepreneur referred to the fact that ZeroAvia’s hybrid hydrogen-fed propulsion system is not yet certified., However, the company has made strides in that direction.

The project reflects a shared commitment to a greener future under the vision, “A Gift from the Earth to the Sky.” It aims to position Colombia as a leader in SAF production in the region and support the global push toward decarbonizing aviation.

Following more than three years of evaluating over 20 available technologies, BioD selected LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology for its proven ability to convert ethanol into SAF at scale. LanzaJet, based in the United States, is recognized internationally for its innovations in ethanol-to-SAF solutions.

The study will evaluate the technical, economic and operational viability of deploying LanzaJet’s ATJ technology in Colombia. It also seeks to determine how the project can be successfully implemented using locally sourced feedstocks, such as agroforestry residues and energy crops approved under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

“This is not just theory—it’s about building the future starting today,” said Carolina Betancourt, head of BioD’s bioenergy business unit and project leader. “Our commitment is to produce SAF in Colombia, generating both environmental and economic benefits for local communities.”

The project aims to become a benchmark for SAF production across Latin America and is aligned with Colombia’s national roadmap for sustainable aviation fuels. It is part of a broader strategy to diversify the country’s energy sources and integrate SAF into the national energy matrix by 2029.

In addition to advancing energy transition goals, the initiative seeks to foster rural development and social inclusion by connecting agricultural regions with industrial transformation efforts.

“This feasibility study is an important milestone for Colombia and for the growth of SAF across Latin America,” said Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet. “We’re proud to bring our leading ATJ technology to this partnership with BioD and to support Colombia’s efforts to build a more sustainable energy future.”

Through this collaboration, LanzaJet and BioD reaffirm their shared dedication to decarbonizing aviation and leading the shift toward sustainable fuel alternatives. The project underscores both companies’ roles in building a resilient, low-carbon aviation sector in Latin America and beyond.

BioD, a Colombian company and national leader in sustainable biodiesel production, has been operating for more than 17 years. Rooted in the principles of innovation and sustainability, BioD is dedicated to creating renewable energy solutions that contribute to a cleaner, more sustainable future.

The UK Government has also announced an additional £400,000 of funding for producers so that new clean fuels can get to market quicker.

SAF is an alternative to fossil jet fuel and reduces greenhouse gas emissions on average by 70% on a lifecycle basis. While the fuel is more costly to produce than jet fuel, the UK Government’s SAF measures protect industry and consumers from excessive costs, it said.

In addition, the revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) will keep ticket price changes minimal – keeping fluctuations to £1.50 a year on average – and will be industry funded through a levy on aviation fuel suppliers. The Department for Transport (DfT) said it would continue to engage with industry on the details of the RCM, including pricing.

A new round of government funding is also being announced to offer fuel producers a share of £400,000 to support the testing and qualification of green fuels, helping to get them to market quicker. This support for producers follows £63 million of funding made available through the Advanced Fuels Fund this year.

Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, said:

“I want to see a golden age for green aviation and today sees take off for sustainable flights.

“Aviation continues to be one of the fastest growing and most integral parts of the UK’s economy, offering more jobs across engineering, tourism and hospitality – and as we support aviation expansion, we need to move at full throttle towards decarbonisation.”

The new legislation will help industry meet its requirements under the SAF Mandate, introduced in January this year, which specifies that at least 10% of all jet fuel used in flights taking off from the UK from 2030, be made with sustainable fuel, rising to 22% by 2040.

The UK Government said its approach on low carbon fuels could add up to £5 billion to the economy by 2050 and position the UK as a global hub for SAF production.

Tim Alderslade, Chief Executive of Airlines UK, said:

“This is a welcome announcement given the importance of the RCM to commercialising and scaling-up SAF production in the UK, a technology key to decarbonising aviation by 2050. A UK SAF industry, kick-started by the RCM and SAF Mandate, can create tens of thousands of jobs across the country whilst supporting our world-class aviation sector to deliver economic growth.

“We look forward to working with government on scheme design and how contracts are allocated, so that we balance the need to deliver the SAF required to support mandate compliance, whilst keeping costs as low as possible through a competitive and transparent bidding process that places the consumer at its heart.”

Duncan McCourt, Chief Executive of Sustainable Aviation, said:

“We hugely welcome the publication of this important legislation. SAF is a crucial element in the plan to decarbonise aviation as it can be used in existing aircraft with existing infrastructure.

“The challenge now is to scale the industry, ensuring we have enough SAF to meet the mandate whilst keeping costs low and create thousands of jobs in the process. This legislation will help to do that.”",https://businessnewswales.com/wp-content/uploads/Boost-for-British-Green-Aviation-Fuel-Production-to-Support-Jobs-and-Lift-Off-Emerging-Industry.png,N,,2025-05-14 13:56:38.051779

It is political, economic, and cultural.","As the global aviation industry works towards decarbonisation goals, the pace and direction of progress are increasingly shaped by shifting political landscapes. Changes in government bring altered priorities, funding frameworks, and regulatory approaches, creating both opportunities and potential headwinds.

In a panel discussion at Sustainable Skies World Summit, taking place at Farnborough International Airport from 14-15 May, senior figures from major airlines, government, and sustainability organisations offered insights into how these politics are influencing the net-zero transition.

Geopolitical Uncertainty

The backdrop to the discussion acknowledged the current period of increased geopolitical uncertainty. In both the UK and the US, trade tensions and populist politics are reshaping priorities, leading to the potential for adverse impacts on climate commitments.

The panellists acknowledged that in the US, President Trump has expressed consistent scepticism towards climate change and has implemented policies that reflect this stance. Meanwhile, Duncan McCourt, Chief Executive at Sustainable Aviation, noted that the increasingly popular Reform party in the UK is following suit, and as a result, the public and political rhetoric surrounding net-zero priorities is changing.

Polona Gregorin, Head of Unit Mobility at the European Commission, highlighted the risks associated with this dynamic political landscape. In particular, the transition to using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents a long-term investment that requires a stable course and consistent regulations. Without consistency, investors and operators alike face uncertainty, which risks hindering progress at a time when momentum is most needed.

Economic Development

Despite the impact of political tensions on net-zero ambitions, the panellists were optimistic that the support for SAF could continue due to economic factors.

Gregorin stressed that in Europe, SAF production will help ensure Europe remains a competitive market in the sector. This drive complements the European Union’s regulatory mandates for SAF, motivated by the need to decarbonise aviation

Likewise, in the US, support for SAF is persisting across party lines by focusing on economic development and job creation, rather than solely on climate impact. For example, Jill Blickstein, Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer at American Airlines, cited the extension of federal SAF tax credits to 2031 as a key win.

Blickstein said:

We've worked closely with both Republicans and Democrats on the hill to make the case for Sustainable Aviation Fuel as a job creator, as a way to support communities, and as a form of production and economic power that can stretch across the United States.

We've seen a nice buildup of support for staff on both sides of the aisle, so that SAF doesn't have to be a partisan climate issue. It's an economic opportunity.

Furthermore, Diana Birkett Rakow, Senior VP of Public Affairs & Sustainability at Alaska Airlines, noted that opportunities to enhance sustainability will also arise from the federal government’s present focus on improving the nation’s Air Traffic Control System. Last week, US Secretary of Transportation Sean P. Duffy announced a plan to build a new air traffic control system to replace the nation’s current infrastructure. This system should be able to deliver improved efficiencies in flight paths and operations that will, in turn, reduce emissions from fuel.

As a result, although decarbonisation may not be the primary priority, the industry can still leverage relevant opportunities to advance progress towards sustainability.

State-Level Support in the US

In addition to federal support, arguably driven by the potential for SAF to act as an engine for economic growth, state-level initiatives in the US also play a pivotal role in advancing the sector.

For example, Birkett Rakow detailed how Washington State has enacted SAF production incentives, drawing companies like Twelve to invest in local infrastructure. Meanwhile, Illinois has taken a different route, offering purchase incentives for SAF buyers. With these contrasting models, US states are able to serve as test beds for scalable national strategies.

The utility of these initiatives was highlighted by Jill Blickstein, who noted that American Airlines is purchasing SAF to be transported via a pipeline from a production facility in Texas to Chicago O’Hare International Airport (ORD), leveraging the state of Illinois’ purchase incentives.

Growth vs. Green in the UK

In the UK, despite noting that the increasingly popular Reform Party appears to be echoing Trump-era attitudes and deprioritising climate action, McCourt maintained that the current UK government remains committed to its net-zero roadmap. In fact, earlier today, new measures to accelerate the support of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) were introduced in Parliament.

However, panel moderator, Dirk Singer, Head of Sustainability at SimpliFlying, pointed out a disconnect between a sustainable ambition and recent government decisions—specifically the approval of multiple airport expansions, including the proposed third runway at Heathrow. Adding to this tension, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has publicly prioritised nationwide economic growth over the protection of natural ecosystems.

Political tension and uncertainty are therefore clearly present in the UK, adding to a global picture of uncertainty around the future of climate policy.

With this in mind, the panel reached consensus on a key message: the aviation sector must not allow political shifts to derail its net-zero trajectory. It must remain on course to decarbonise regardless of who’s in power in each nation.

International Models – Singapore

To achieve this vision, the industry requires clear, consistent regulations and policies that encourage stable investment in key technologies such as SAF. Policies and pricing currently vary greatly across nations with different mandates, levy structures, and incentive schemes, and the most prosperous model is not yet evident.

As an example, Singapore’s emerging model drew particular attention during the panel discussion for its consumer-facing approach. A small surcharge on airline tickets, essentially a SAF levy, will be used by the government to purchase SAF centrally, creating cost stability and transparency.

Jill Blickstein praised this model, stating that it fosters awareness among consumers while also sending a stable demand signal to producers. However, McCourt cautioned against this approach in the UK, where public support is already wavering away from politics in favour of net-zero initiatives. He argued that an explicit tax on consumers could easily contribute to eroding public support for climate action in aviation.

Looking Ahead

Ultimately, the event highlighted that the challenge to decarbonising aviation isn’t just technological. It is political, economic, and cultural.

Accelerating technology remains a key challenge, but aligning policy and public support is arguably even harder—and even more essential.

Senate File 657 and its House companion, House File 1054, contain 17 provisions, including the creation of tax credits for film production, sustainable aviation fuel, as well as the elimination of older credit programs.

It also overhauls the Research Activities Credit, a program that provides tax incentives to businesses, replacing it with the Research and Development Tax Credit Program. The new program, administered by the Iowa Economic Development Authority, would provide tax credits to eligible businesses that incur qualified research expenses in Iowa.

Under the bill, qualifying businesses include those primarily engaged in sectors including second-generation food innovation, crop protection, diagnostic analytics and immunotherapies, chip technologies and microelectronics, medical equipment and supplies, software and technology, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, consumer products and others.

Republican Sen. Dan Dawson, of Council Bluffs, the bill’s sponsor, said the overhaul of business tax incentives makes the credit awards more up-front and makes the process less “cumbersome.”

“It's always important for us to look at some of our whole programs and figure out how we can modernize our new programs,” Dawson said.

The creation of the Research and Development Tax Credit Program includes a provision that would take back credits awarded to businesses that lay off workers and knowingly employ individuals not authorized to legally work in Iowa.

This provision comes from a bill introduced earlier in the session that would’ve clawed back Research Activities tax credits from businesses that implemented “mass layoffs” in 2024. The legislation was aimed at Deere & Co. after workforce layoffs over the past few years.

Republican Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, of Wilton, who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, said the provision would make sure that state funds don’t go to companies that lay off Iowa workers.

“Both provisions are designed to punish a company that knowingly hires undocumented immigrants and/or ships jobs out of the country or out of the state,” Kaufmann told reporters Monday. “If you're doing either of those practices, you do not deserve our tax credits. I would have preferred a chain saw approach. This is a scalpel approach, but at least it gives them (IEDA) a hammer.”

During Deere’s 2022 layoffs, it announced that work from the 250 jobs at the Waterloo facility would be moved to Ramos Component Works in Mexico, which was completed last year. The company has, however, repeatedly affirmed its commitment to U.S. manufacturing and has said the layoffs are responses to changes in the farm economy, not an effort to move jobs out of the U.S.

Democratic Sen. Bill Dotzler, of Waterloo, backed the bill, adding that state funding should go to companies that keep jobs in Iowa.

“If we're giving large amounts of money to a business and they have a major layoff, we should be clawing back those resources and using them in the right spot,” Dotzler said during Senate debate Tuesday.

The legislation also would keep, but pare down, Endow Iowa after a full cut of the program was originally floated.

The Endow Iowa program awards tax credits to people who make donations to qualified community foundations across the state. The bill would reduce its funding to $3.5 million for FY 2026 from the $6 million provided in 2025.

The adjustment to the program is projected to increase Iowa general fund revenues by $2.3 million in FY 2027.

Here is what else the bill would do:

London, UK: The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), in collaboration with global consultancy ICF, has today launched a bold new framework urging the entire Travel & Tourism sector to unite in tackling one of its toughest challenges: scaling up the production and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other renewable fuels.

The report, Scaling Up Sustainable Fuel, sets out a practical roadmap for how every business in the sector, no matter its size or role, can help address transport-related emissions and accelerate the shift to cleaner fuels.

Julia Simpson, WTTC President & CEO, said ""Sustainable fuel is the single biggest game-changer for Travel & Tourism, but right now, supply falls dangerously short of demand. If we don’t act together, we risk rising costs, limited availability, and stalled climate progress.

“Every hotel, tour operator, travel agency, cruise line and airline has a role to play. This framework gives them the blueprint. Sustainable fuel is not just an environmental necessity; it’s a business imperative and governments must incentivise the production of SAF, not just set targets for the sector.”

Today, SAF accounts for just 0.3% of global jet fuel use. To meet net-zero targets by 2050, production must increase more than 400-fold – from 1.25BN litres today to over 450BN litres. That will require as many as 6,500 new renewable fuel plants worldwide. Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF) faces similar supply and infrastructure constraints.

Unlike other decarbonisation options, SAF is a ‘drop-in’ solution. It works with existing engines and aircraft. But high production costs, limited infrastructure, and feedstock competition have kept volumes low and prices high – up to 10 times that of conventional fuel.

The new WTTC-ICF framework offers clear, tiered actions for Travel & Tourism stakeholders to engage, whether as Collaborators, Promoters, Adopters, or Investors. From joining campaigns and supplying waste products, to funding production facilities or purchasing sustainable fuel certificates, the report makes it clear: every business can contribute.

Daniel Galpin, ICF Managing Director, stated “Decarbonising transport is a crucial step towards achieving a sustainable tourism sector. While transport industries, particularly aviation with its focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), have recognised the importance of sustainable fuels and are couragesouly working towards a new era, there remains a significant journey ahead. It is essential for the broader tourism ecosystem to take action and provide support to meet the targets set, as well as to implement both operational and strategic changes required.

“ICF is proud to have collaborated closely with WTTC to identify the roles that tourism stakeholders can adopt and the actions they can take to facilitate the decarbonisation of the sector, thereby contributing to a more sustainable future.”

Real-world case studies show how action is already underway. The Erawan Group is turning hotel waste oil into SAF, in Asia, whilst Jet2 has invested in a UK-based SAF plant using recyclable household waste.

Crucially, the report warns that unless the sector acts collectively, SAF mandates introduced by governments, requiring a 5% to 10% blend by 2030, could increase travel costs and limit consumer choice.

American families have been hit hard by inflation, and more and more consumers are seeking out lower-cost options at the pump.
In April, both Minnesota and Iowa (the only states that specifically report E15 sales) announced record breaking sales in 2024, with sales in Iowa surging by an impressive 45%.
Just weeks ago, Growth Energy’s Technical Director for Market Development Reid Wagner was one of the first customers to take advantage of Costco’s new Unleaded 88 (or E15) fuel offering.
And thanks to Nebraska’s E15 Access Standard, Nebraskans will soon have access to low-cost Unleaded 88 at even more locations.","Earlier this spring, the Trump administration formally announced a summer waiver allowing uninterrupted sales of lower-cost E15. Action on the waiver fulfills a key element of President Trump’s executive order directing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to leverage E15 “to meet any projected temporary shortfalls in the supply of gasoline across the Nation.”

The decision takes the guesswork out of summer fueling options, giving our retail partners the regulatory certainty they need to manage inventory and protect a critical market for U.S. farmers. It could not come at a better time.

E15 demand is growing at a record pace. American families have been hit hard by inflation, and more and more consumers are seeking out lower-cost options at the pump. In April, both Minnesota and Iowa (the only states that specifically report E15 sales) announced record breaking sales in 2024, with sales in Iowa surging by an impressive 45%.

Other states aren’t far behind. Just weeks ago, Growth Energy’s Technical Director for Market Development Reid Wagner was one of the first customers to take advantage of Costco’s new Unleaded 88 (or E15) fuel offering. Located at the Costco in La Vista, Nebraska, it is the first Costco location in the country to offer the higher blended fuel. And thanks to Nebraska’s E15 Access Standard, Nebraskans will soon have access to low-cost Unleaded 88 at even more locations.

Of course, retailers and motorists aren’t the only winners. E15 can also help deliver on the President’s trade agenda, which includes securing domestic markets for domestic goods, so U.S. producers are less vulnerable to foreign trade barriers. It provides American farmers with more certain and reliable markets for their corn.

The bottom line is that E15 presents a huge opportunity to boost the rural economy and lower prices at the pump. And with a temporary waiver in place, our champions in Congress and the White House can focus on passing legislation restoring permanent, unrestricted access to E15 for all months, all states, all stations and all fuel dispensers.

That is Growth Energy’s goal, and we urge readers to help us keep up the momentum by visiting GrowthEnergy.com/E15Now, where biofuel supporters can quickly connect with their members of Congress. We have a coalition that is bigger and broader than it’s ever been, and with a permanent E15 fix in place in advance of the 2026 summer driving season, the need for temporary EPA waivers will be a thing of the past.

Of these companies, Unearthed found that five had apparently continued to promote claims that were actually or in effect identical after the ruling.
A spokesperson for Sources Alma said the company had “never intended to mislead consumers with inappropriate or erroneous environmental claims”.
She told Unearthed: “We are aware of the [ASA’s] decision on 19 January 2022 concerning our TV ad featuring the Aqua Pura brand.
By the end of last year this had resulted in rulings against 44 companies for breaching rules against misleading environmental claims.","Major brands, including car manufacturers, an airline, and a bottled water company have apparently continued to promote environmental claims after they were ruled “misleading” in a crackdown on greenwashing by the UK’s advertising watchdog, an Unearthed investigation has found.

Among them is Virgin Atlantic, which has kept posts pinned to the top of its Instagram, TikTok, and X accounts boasting it completed the first transatlantic flight using “100% sustainable aviation fuel.” The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled against Virgin nine months ago for using this language in an advert, saying it was likely to lead a “significant proportion” of people to “overestimate” the environmental benefits of the fuel.

Meanwhile, the car company Renault published videos on Facebook and YouTube last year claiming its hybrid cars offered “up to 80% electric driving” in the city, despite a 2023 ASA investigation which found that this wording fell foul of rules against misleading environmental claims.

And the front page of bottled water brand Aqua Pura’s website continued to boast about its “NEW Environmentally Friendly Caps”, three years after the ASA told the company to stop claiming that plastic bottle lids were “eco-friendly”.

An Unearthed analysis of online marketing activity by 44 companies ruled to have made misleading green claims in recent years found that at least five had continued to promote similar or identical claims after the ASA ruling.

Andrew Simms, director of the campaign group Badvertising, which has called for tougher regulation of greenwashing and a ban on advertising “high carbon” products, said that for some industries the rules against making false green claims seemed to be “hidden in clouds of their own planet-heating pollution”.

He added: “If, on the rare occasions that complaints to the regulator are investigated and upheld they simply get ignored, then the system seems broken, leaving the public in the grip of misinformation.”

A spokesperson for the ASA, which regulates UK advertising across all media, said that the regulator’s work on climate change and the environment “continues to be a priority area and we continue to proactively monitor green claims using our AI-based Active Ad Monitoring system, finding ads that potentially break our rules and getting those that do quickly amended or removed”.

“Monthly sweeps show high levels of compliance and we continue to act where we spot non-compliant ads,” he told Unearthed. “We are seeing businesses adapting and evolving to make better evidenced, more precise green claims.”

Unearthed provided the ASA with details of recent marketing activity by 16 companies that the regulator ruled had made misleading environmental claims. Of these companies, Unearthed found that five had apparently continued to promote claims that were actually or in effect identical after the ruling. These included instances where claims had been newly posted after the ruling, or where they had been maintained in prominent positions like the frontpage of a website, or pinned to the top of a social media account.

In addition, Unearthed provided details about a further 11 companies, which are not named in this article. These involved claims which merited review by the regulator but were less clear-cut – for example, instances where a claim was repeated shortly before it was ruled misleading.

The ASA spokesperson said the regulator would carefully assess the ad claims Unearthed had brought to its attention and it would “consider each case on its merits”. He added that the ASA could not make definitive judgements within the “short timeframe provided”, but that its initial assessment suggested there were “a number of examples that do not present obvious or clear-cut issues under our rules”.

However, at least three of the companies made changes to their websites this week after being approached by Unearthed for comment. These included Sources Alma, the French parent company of Aqua Pura.

A spokesperson for Sources Alma said the company had “never intended to mislead consumers with inappropriate or erroneous environmental claims”.

She told Unearthed: “We are aware of the [ASA’s] decision on 19 January 2022 concerning our TV ad featuring the Aqua Pura brand.

“At the same time, our marketing department, whose teams are split between the UK and France, has undergone a major restructuring. As a result, it has not been able to apply the ASA’s recommendations effectively across all communication channels between 2022 and 2023.”

Yesterday afternoon (Tuesday) Aqua Pura’s website was offline while “undergoing maintenance”.

The company’s spokesperson added: “In any case, we are now in line with ASA recommendations.”

A Renault UK spokesperson said the car manufacturer would “investigate the issues raised” by Unearthed’s findings.

However, a spokesperson for Virgin Atlantic told Unearthed that sustainable aviation fuel would be key to achieving net zero, and that the company’s transatlantic flight using the fuel was a “milestone for the industry”.

She added: “Social posts were shared to mark the achievement, demonstrate the breadth of the project and the challenges that remain for the industry to achieve net zero.”

The Virgin posts remained in place as of this morning.

The ASA launched its multi-year crackdown on greenwashing in advertising in September 2021, in what it said was an effort to support the UK’s push for net zero. By the end of last year this had resulted in rulings against 44 companies for breaching rules against misleading environmental claims.

Unearthed carried out a review of online activity by these companies to see how they had responded to the ruling.

The rules on environmental claims require advertisers, among other things, to be clear about the basis of the claim being promoted. If an advertiser makes an “absolute” claim – like describing a product as “eco-friendly” or “100% recycled” – this has to be supported by a high level of evidence.

“Eco-friendly” claims

In a November 2023 radio advert, Virgin Atlantic claimed it was about to become the first commercial airline to fly across the Atlantic using “100% sustainable aviation fuel.”

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) are derived from waste cooking oils and fats, green waste and non-food crops. They generally have a lower “lifecycle” carbon footprint than petroleum-based jet fuels, but they produce just as much CO2 when burned.

Virgin’s “Flight100” was hailed by the UK government at the time as a “major milestone towards making air travel more environmentally friendly” and heavily promoted by the airline.

However, the ASA received complaints about Virgin’s radio advert, and in August last year it ruled that the unqualified claim “100% sustainable aviation fuel” was misleading. The regulator said a significant proportion of listeners would think this meant that the fuel itself was 100% sustainable. It concluded that most consumers were “unlikely to be aware of the extent to which fuels described as sustainable aviation fuel still had negative environmental impacts”. Virgin had told the ASA that the flight was calculated to have delivered 64% savings in “lifecycle” greenhouse gas emissions, but this, the regulator said, showed that SAF “still produced significant emissions over its lifecycle”. It told Virgin that in future adverts referring to SAFs needed to explain the environmental impact of the fuel.

Despite this, Virgin kept video posts which use the “100% sustainable aviation fuel” claim “pinned” to the top of its corporate Instagram, TikTok and X feeds – ensuring they are among the most visible posts to visitors on these pages. In addition, Virgin marked the first anniversary of the flight with a new Instagram post repeating the claim, published four months after the ASA ruling. None of these posts provide any qualifying information about SAF’s environmental impact.

A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson told Unearthed that it was “committed to achieving net zero by 2050” and SAF would be key to this as “one of the most immediate levers to decarbonising long haul aviation”.

She added: “Flight100 was a milestone for industry globally as it proved that SAF is a safe, 100% drop-in replacement for fossil fuel and demonstrated the radical collaboration required to drive increased production, supply and uptake.”

But Alethea Warrington, head of aviation, heat and energy at climate charity Possible, told Unearthed: “The aviation industry wants us to believe that speculative and unscalable technologies can keep the sector growing while bringing emissions under control.”

Unearthed also found several instances of carmakers apparently repeating claims about the environmental impact of their vehicles similar to those that the ASA had already ruled to be misleading.

In November 2023, the ASA issued a ruling against Renault for an online advert that said one of its hybrid vehicles offered “up to 80% electric driving in the city”.

The regulator concluded there were “numerous possible interpretations” of the claim, from the share of journeys completed in electric mode to the time spent without petrol. It ruled that Renault’s advert “omitted material information and was likely to mislead.”

Renault told the ASA it removed the original ad. However, in 2024 it used the same claim in a Youtube video for the Renault Symbioz, and separately in two Facebook posts for other vehicles. In all three examples, no explanation of how this claim should be interpreted was included.

Misleading advertising of fossil fueled cars to make them appear ‘green’ risks delaying crucial emissions reductions

– James Ward, AdFree Cities

A Renault spokesperson told Unearthed: “Renault UK takes its responsibilities seriously and will investigate the issues raised.”

In early 2024, the car brand MG was reprimanded by the ASA for using the unqualified claim “zero emissions” in an online advert for a range of electric and hybrid models, including the MG5 EV. The ASA ruled that the company needed to be clear that the phrase “zero emissions” only applies to an electric vehicle while it is “being driven,” since EV manufacturing and charging can still produce carbon emissions. For plug-in hybrids, the ASA said MG must be clear that the claim applies only when driving on battery power.

Still, MG’s August 2024 brochure for an MG5 electric vehicle repeatedly boasted that it had “zero emissions” without providing any further qualifying text. Separately, a description on MG UK’s website for a used MG4 included the unqualified text: “Eco-Friendly & Cost-Efficient: Say goodbye to fuel costs and embrace zero emissions with an electric vehicle that’s both good for the planet and your wallet.”

After Unearthed approached MG for comment this week, this text was removed from the used car advert on its website.

A spokesperson for the brand said: “MG Motor UK fully accepted and then immediately responded to the ASA at the time, this related to a hybrid vehicle also being featured alongside an EV model and this was a point of clarification from the ASA which we accepted. We will always fully and actively cooperate with the ASA regarding any guidelines and all our creative teams are actively briefed to do so.”

James Ward, anti-greenwash campaigner at the campaign group Adfree Cities, said car advertising was “rife with greenwash claims,” and that “misleading advertising of fossil fueled cars to make them appear ‘green’ risks delaying crucial emissions reductions needed in the transport sector, which remains the UK’s highest emitting sector.”

Unearthed also found examples of plastic product manufacturers apparently continuing to promote claims after they had been ruled misleading. Easigrass, a UK artificial grass manufacturer, had continued to claim on its website that one of its plastic grass products was“eco-friendly and 100% recyclable” more than a year after the ASA told the company to stop making these claims about a similar product. The watchdog had found no evidence that plastic grass was “eco-friendly”, and concluded the term “fully recyclable” was misleading because there was only one facility in the entire UK that could recycle plastic grass.

After Unearthed approached Easigrass for comment the company removed the claims from its website, and thanked Unearthed for bringing them to its attention.

A spokesperson said: “We acknowledge the ASA’s ruling issued in March 2024 and can confirm that the marketing language referenced in your message was scheduled for removal following that decision.”

The spokesperson added that the claims identified by Unearthed had been “inadvertently missed” by Easigrass’ website team.

Similarly, the bottled water brand Aqua Pura was censured in January 2022 for a TV ad describing its 500ml bottle as a “100% recycled & recyclable bottle with eco-friendly cap.” The ASA ruled the claim “100% recycled bottle” misleading, since the cap and label were not recycled. The ruling also took the brand to task for claiming its bottles had an “eco-friendly cap”. Aqua Pura was told not to “overstate the environmental benefit” of its products, and not to “claim that products made of plastic were ‘eco-friendly’ or ‘nature friendly’”.

Despite this, until this week the front page of the brand’s website continued to boast about “NEW Environmentally Friendly Caps.” Unearthed also found that in two 2022 LinkedIn adverts posted after the ruling, Aqua Pura continued to describe its bottles as “100% recycled plastic” without clarifying this excluded caps and labels, and called their plastic caps “eco-friendly.” And a Facebook post for that year’s National Recycling Week also claimed “our bottles” are made from “100% recycled plastic,” without qualification.

A spokesperson for Aqua Pura’s French parent company, Sources Alma, told Unearthed that preserving the environment was an “absolute priority”, but that a 2022 restructuring of the company’s marketing department meant it had “not been able to apply the ASA’s recommendations effectively across all communication channels between 2022 and 2023”.

“Nevertheless, we take the ASA’s recommendations and the various points raised [by Unearthed] very seriously,” she continued.

“We will verify the current and future application of all recommendations relating to environmental claims, particularly on our website.”

She said the company’s product labels made clear that the claim “100% recycled” excluded caps and labels, and added: “We will also make this clear on our website.”

She added that the brand’s bottle caps remained attached to the bottles, preventing “the cap from being lost in nature, thereby reducing the amount of plastic waste that could end up in the environment”. “We are proud of this technology and wanted to highlight the benefits of this specific cap compared to a standard cap,” she said.

Tougher sanctions?

The ASA is responsible for investigating complaints to ensure ads comply with its advertising codes, and banning those it deems misleading, harmful, or irresponsible.

It is clear that consumers care about sustainability, or else companies would not even mention the environment

– Genevieve Guenther, End Climate Silence

The ASA claims most advertisers comply with its rulings to avoid significant reputational damage, however it does not have the power to impose fines. For “non-compliant” offenders, its sanctions are limited to naming and shaming companies on its website, requesting ads be removed from search engines and social media platforms, and issuing its own paid ads calling out violations. Once censured, companies are instructed not to run substantively similar ads in the future.

Campaigners like Badvertising have argued that the ASA is “not fit for purpose” to regulate advertising claims by polluting companies, and have called for reforms including “a mandate for legally binding rulings and fines” and enforcement powers to “suspend an advert pending investigation”.

Victoria Harvey, a PhD student at University of East Anglia specialising in sustainability in UK advertising, told Unearthed: “My research shows that the advertising trade bodies in general do not go far enough to protect against greenwashing.”

She added: “We urgently need updated and fit for purpose regulation that works harder to protect consumers and the environment.”

However, the ASA spokesperson said it was seeing businesses “adapting and evolving” in response to its work on climate and environment, and making “better evidenced, more precise green claims”. He added: “As an example, following our airline rulings on ‘sustainable’ and ‘eco-friendly’ claims, of the circa 140,000 ads monitored, five were found to be non-compliant.”

“It is clear that consumers care about sustainability, or else companies would not even mention the environment,” said Genevieve Guenther, founding director of media watchdog organisation End Climate Silence and author of The Language of Climate Politics.

“So even if the ASA cannot fine the companies that continue to mislead about the climate impacts of their products and services, consumers can boycott those companies to register their displeasure and even force them to change their practices.”

Political pressure

In some parts of Europe, governments have begun to impose tougher restrictions on advertising for high-carbon products. In 2022, France became the first European country to ban fossil fuel advertising. Cities including Edinburgh, in Scotland, and the Hague, in the Netherlands, have introduced bans on a range of high-carbon advertising, including commercial flights, SUVs and cruise ships.

In London seven months ago, Green Party Assembly member Caroline Russell urged Mayor Sadiq Khan to restrict fossil fuel ads on the capital’s public transport network, which has hosted more than 240 oil and gas campaigns since 2018.

“I’ve repeatedly challenged the Mayor on [Transport for London’s] advertising policies, and this new research leaves no room for doubt,” she told Unearthed. She added that companies that misled the public about their environmental records have “no business having access to prime advertising space in our city.“",https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1981169007-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 09:56:07.416690

An alternative to fossil jet fuel, SAF remains more expensive to produce, though the government’s dedicated SAF measures protect both the industry and consumers from inflated costs.

In addition to existing measures; the revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) will aim to keep ticket price changes minimal as the fuel alternative sees wider adoption throughout the industry, with fluctuations expected to sit around 1.50 GBP per year on average, which will in turn be funded through a levy on aviation fuel suppliers.

The Department for Transport (DfT) has stated it will continue to engage with industry leaders in order to maintain a consistent standard with regards to the RCM, including pricing.

Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, said:

I want to see a golden age for green aviation and today sees take off for sustainable flights.

Aviation continues to be one of the fastest growing and most integral parts of the UK’s economy, offering more jobs across engineering, tourism and hospitality – and as we support aviation expansion, we need to move at full throttle towards decarbonisation.

We are making the UK one of the best places in the world to produce sustainable aviation fuel, putting the pedal down on growth and boosting job opportunities across the country as part of the Plan for Change.

The new legislation is hoped to aid the aviation industry to meet requirements set out by the SAF mandate, which was introduced in January this year and specifies that a minimum of 10% of all jet fuel used in flights taking off from the UK from 2030 be made with sustainable fuel. This is planned to be extended to 22% by 2040.

Duncan McCourt, Chief Executive of Sustainable Aviation, said:

We hugely welcome the publication of this important legislation. SAF is a crucial element in the plan to decarbonise aviation as it can be used in existing aircraft with existing infrastructure.

The challenge now is to scale the industry, ensuring we have enough SAF to meet the mandate whilst keeping costs low and create thousands of jobs in the process. This legislation will help to do that.

In 2021, the ASA announced a greenwashing crackdown, censuring companies for making claims without evidence.
As recently as last week, at least five of these firms were still posting claims they had been censured for making, according to Unearthed.
However, it has continued to claim on its website that one of its plastic grass products is “eco-friendly and 100% recyclable”.
As an example, following our airline rulings on ‘sustainable’ and ‘eco-friendly’ claims, of the circa 140,000 ads monitored, five were found to be non-compliant.","Companies have continued to post misleading greenwashing adverts after being censured by the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA), according to an investigation.

Greenpeace UK’s investigative journalism unit, Unearthed, reports that Virgin Atlantic, Renault and Aqua Pura are among companies that continued to publish unfounded claims about the environmental credentials of their products after being told to remove such adverts by the advertising watchdog.

In 2021, the ASA announced a greenwashing crackdown, censuring companies for making claims without evidence. It said 44 firms had made misleading advertisements. As recently as last week, at least five of these firms were still posting claims they had been censured for making, according to Unearthed.

ASA rules mean advertisers need to be clear about the evidence behind any environmental claims, and a high burden of proof is needed for any absolute claims, such as that a product is “sustainable” or “eco-friendly”. The watchdog has few powers to ensure companies comply with their rulings; it says if firms are seen to be ignoring the rules it can “significantly damage their reputation”. However, it does not have the power to issue fines to advertisers.

Sanctions available include naming the company on the ASA website, asking search engines to remove paid search ads that contain the claim, asking social media companies to remove “non-compliant content”, and taking out its own paid search ads naming the company.

Virgin Atlantic has kept posts “pinned” to the top of its Instagram, TikTok and X accounts, claiming it completed the first transatlantic flight using “100% sustainable aviation fuel”, according to Unearthed. This is despite the ASA making a ruling against the airline nine months ago for this wording in an advert, because it was likely to lead consumers to overestimate the carbon savings of using the fuel – it thought consumers would interpret “100% sustainable aviation fuel” to mean the fuel was completely sustainable with no negative environmental impact.

Renault repeatedly published videos on Facebook and YouTube last year claiming its hybrid cars offered “up to 80% electric driving in the city”, despite a 2023 ASA ruling finding this wording to be misleading.

Other car manufacturers have continued to make green claims about their vehicles after being censured by the ASA. MG last year promoted its hybrid cars as “zero emissions”, but the ASA ruled the claim misleading, as hybrid vehicles are not zero emissions when being powered by petrol or diesel. Electric vehicles are zero emissions only when driving if the electricity that charged them is 100% renewable. An August 2024 brochure for an electric vehicle promoted in an original ad banned by the ASA repeatedly used the term “zero emissions” without clarification. Meanwhile, an ad for a used MG4 on the company’s website suggests that drivers can “embrace zero emissions” without clarification.

The front page of bottled water brand Aqua Pura’s website as recently as last week boasted about its “NEW Environmentally Friendly Caps”, three years after the ASA told the company to stop claiming that plastic bottle lids were “eco-friendly”. Easigrass, which makes plastic lawns, was told by the ASA more than a year ago to stop calling its synthetic grass products “eco-friendly”. However, it has continued to claim on its website that one of its plastic grass products is “eco-friendly and 100% recyclable”. At the time, the watchdog said that there was no proof that plastic grass was “eco friendly” and only one facility in the UK can recycle plastic grass.

An ASA spokesperson said: “Our world-leading work on climate change and the environment continues to be a priority area and we continue to proactively monitor green claims using our AI-based Active Ad Monitoring system, finding ads that potentially break our rules and getting those that do quickly amended or removed.

“We are seeing businesses adapting and evolving to make better evidenced, more precise green claims. As an example, following our airline rulings on ‘sustainable’ and ‘eco-friendly’ claims, of the circa 140,000 ads monitored, five were found to be non-compliant. But where we find issues, we act; as evidenced by our series of high-profile rulings against a range of businesses including some of the biggest companies in the world.”

A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: “We’re committed to achieving net zero by 2050 and key to this will be using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is one of the most immediate levers to decarbonising long haul aviation. Flight100 was a milestone for industry globally as it proved that SAF is a safe, 100% drop-in replacement for fossil fuel and demonstrated the radical collaboration required to drive increased production, supply and uptake.

“Social posts were shared to mark the achievement, demonstrate the breadth of the project and the challenges that remain for the industry to achieve net zero.”

A Renault spokesperson said: “Renault UK takes its responsibilities seriously and will investigate the issues raised.”

An Aqua Pura spokesperson said its advertising team had recently undergone a restructuring, meaning it was difficult to implement all the recommendations, adding: “We will verify the current and future application of all recommendations relating to environmental claims, particularly on our website.”

MG Motor UK said: “MG Motor UK fully accepted and then immediately responded to the ASA at the time, this related to a hybrid vehicle also being featured alongside an EV model and this was a point of clarification from the ASA which we accepted. We will always fully and actively cooperate with the ASA regarding any guidelines and all our creative teams are actively briefed to do so.”

An Easigrass spokesperson said: “We acknowledge the ASA’s ruling issued in March 2024 and can confirm that the marketing language referenced in your message was scheduled for removal following that decision. While our intention was to ensure all relevant content was updated accordingly, it appears a small number of archived references were inadvertently missed by our website team.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5576ba431ec0e73059f2de2e82fc32c2c6f38bef/171_0_2715_2173/master/2715.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=16196c5f4bb19b7e2dc9a08e1792a2ed,N,,2025-05-14 07:56:52.490276

The Nigerian government hosted a high-level regional workshop in Lagos State from 5th to 9th May 2025. Organised by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) in collaboration with the National Council on Climate Change Secretariat (NCCCS) and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the hybrid workshop aimed to explore SAF investment opportunities and address the sector’s financial and operational challenges.

The workshop brought together stakeholders from 14 African countries, alongside SAF project developers and international financial institutions. Coordinated by Mrs. Yinka Iriobe of the NCAA’s Directorate of Air Transport Regulations, the event focused on investment de-risking strategies, project bankability, and mechanisms for sustainable financing.

A significant milestone of the workshop was the formal inauguration of six (6) Technical Working Groups (TWGs) by the Director-General of NCAA, Captain Chris Najomo. These groups will oversee SAF development in Nigeria across key areas: Policy and Regulation, Feedstock and Production, Funding and Investment, Technology and Innovation, Environmental and Social Impact, and Infrastructure and Logistics.

The final two days of the event were dedicated to Nigeria’s domestic SAF roadmap, with participants engaging in robust discussions around project financing, capacity building, and access to sustainable energy sources in aviation.

The workshop formed part of the ACT-SAF Africa-India Project (Part II), designed to provide assistance, training, and capacity building for SAF development. Presentations from developers and financiers highlighted the need for robust risk mitigation frameworks and multi-stakeholder collaboration to support viable SAF production in Africa.

Participants also examined the SAF direct supply chain, financing tools, and best financial practices, while mapping key stakeholders and identifying existing financial instruments that could support the SAF value chain.

Sustainable aviation fuel is an alternative to fossil jet fuel, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 70% on average on a lifecycle basis.

With decarbonisation key to accelerating expansion plans, the government has also announced an additional £400,000 of funding for producers so that new clean fuels can get to market quicker, speeding up the UK’s path to green flying.

While the fuel is more costly to produce than jet fuel, the government’s SAF measures protect industry and consumers from excessive costs.

In addition, the revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) will keep ticket price changes minimal, keeping fluctuations to £1.50 a year on average, and will be industry-funded through a levy on aviation fuel suppliers.

The Department for Transport (DfT) will continue to engage with industry on the details of the RCM, including pricing.

Speeding up the SAF commercialisation process

A new round of government funding is also being announced to offer fuel producers a share of £400,000 to support the testing and qualification of green fuels, helping to get them to market quicker.

This support for producers follows £63m of funding made available through the Advanced Fuels Fund this year.

The government’s commitments to green fuel will help deliver on its missions to kickstart economic growth via job creation and become a clean energy superpower. It will also allow the UK to go further and faster with expansion plans, boosting the tourism industry.

Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, stated: “Aviation continues to be one of the fastest growing and most integral parts of the UK’s economy, offering more jobs across engineering, tourism and hospitality, and as we support aviation expansion, we need to move at full throttle towards decarbonisation.

“We are making the UK one of the best places in the world to produce sustainable aviation fuel, putting the pedal down on growth and boosting job opportunities across the country.”

22% of jet fuel must be green by 2040

The new legislation will help industry meet its requirements under the SAF Mandate, introduced in January this year, which specifies that at least 10% of all jet fuel used in flights taking off from the UK from 2030, be made with sustainable fuel, rising to 22% by 2040.

The government’s approach to low-carbon fuels could add up to £5bn to the economy by 2050 and position the UK as a global hub for SAF production.

“A UK SAF industry, kick-started by the RCM and SAF Mandate, can create tens of thousands of jobs across the country whilst supporting our world-class aviation sector to deliver economic growth,” explained Tim Alderslade, Chief Executive of Airlines UK.

Duncan McCourt, Chief Executive of Sustainable Aviation, added: “We hugely welcome the publication of this important legislation. SAF is a crucial element in the plan to decarbonise aviation as it can be used in existing aircraft with existing infrastructure.”

He concluded: “The challenge now is to scale the industry, ensuring we have enough SAF to meet the mandate whilst keeping costs low and creating thousands of jobs in the process. This legislation will help to do that.”",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2510038875.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 06:56:59.018885

US budget bill would prolong 45Z, boost crops

New York, 13 May (Argus) — A proposal from House Republican tax-writers would extend for four additional years a new tax credit for low-carbon fuels and adjust the incentive to be more lenient to crops used for biofuels. Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee on Monday introduced their draft portion of a far-reaching budget bill, which included various changes to Inflation Reduction Act clean energy subsidies. But the ""45Z"" Clean Fuel Production Credit, which requires fuels to meet an initial carbon intensity threshold and then ups the subsidy as emissions fall, would be the only incentive from the 2022 climate law to last even longer than Democrats planned under the current draft. The proposal represents an early signal of Republicans' plans for major legislation through the Senate's reconciliation process, which allows budget-related bills to pass with a simple majority vote. The full Ways and Means Committee will consider amendments at a markup this afternoon, and House leaders want the full chamber to vote on the larger budget bill before the US Memorial Day holiday on 26 May. Afterwards, the proposal would head to the Republican-controlled Senate, where lawmakers could float further changes. But the early draft, in a chamber with multiple deficit hawks and climate change skeptics that have pushed for a full repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act, is remarkable for not just keeping but expanding 45Z. The basics of the incentive — offering benefits to producers instead of blenders, throttling benefits based on carbon intensity, and offering more credit to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — would remain intact. Various changes would help fuels derived from US crops. The most notable would prevent regulators measuring carbon intensity from considering ""indirect land use change"" emissions that attempt to quantify the risks of using agricultural land for fuel instead of food. Under current emissions modeling, the typical dry mill corn ethanol plant does not meet the 45Z credit's initial carbon intensity requirement — but substantially more gallons produced today would have a chance at qualifying without any new investments in carbon capture if this bill were to pass. The indirect land use change would also create the possibility for canola-based fuels, which are just slightly too carbon-intensive to qualify for 45Z today, to start claiming some subsidy. Fuels from soybean oil currently qualify but would similarly benefit from larger potential credits. Still, credit values would depend on final regulations and updated carbon accounting from President Donald Trump's administration. Since the House proposal does not address the current law's blunt system for rounding emissions values up and down, relatively higher-carbon corn and canola fuels still face the risk of falling just below 45Z's required carbon intensity threshold but then being rounded up to a level where they receive zero subsidy. The House bill would also restrict eligibility to fuels derived from feedstocks sourced in the US, Canada, and Mexico — an attempt at a middle ground between refiners that have increasingly looked abroad for biofuel inputs and domestic farm groups that have lobbied for 45Z to prioritize US crops. That language would make more durable current restrictions on foreign used cooking oil and significantly reduce the incentive to import tallow from South America and Australia, a loss for major renewable diesel producers Diamond Green Diesel, Phillips 66, and Marathon Petroleum. The provision would also hurt US biofuel producer LanzaJet, which has imported lower-carbon Brazilian sugarcane ethanol as a SAF feedstock to the chagrin of domestic corn ethanol producers. The bill would also require regulators to set more granular carbon intensity calculations for different types of animal manure biogas projects, all of which are treated the same under current rules. Other lifecycle emissions models treat some dairy projects at deeply negative carbon intensities. Those changes to carbon intensity calculations and feedstock eligibility would kick in starting next year, meaning current rules would remain intact for now. The proposal would however phase out the ability of clean energy companies without enough tax liability to claim the full value of Inflation Reduction Act subsidies to sell those tax credits to other businesses. That pathway, known as transferability, would end for clean fuel producers after 2027, hurting small biodiesel producers that operate under thin margins in the best of times as well as SAF startups that were planning to start producing fuel later this decade. Markets unresponsive, but prepare for new possibilities There was little immediate reaction across biofuel, feedstock, and renewable identification number (RIN) credit markets, since the bill could be modified and most of the changes would only take force in the future. But markets may shift down the road. Limiting eligibility to feedstocks originating in North America for instance could continue recent strength in US soybean oil futures markets. July CBOT Soybean oil futures closed 3pc higher on Monday at 49.92¢/lb on the news and have traded even higher today. The spread between soybean oil and heating oil futures is then highly influential for the cost of D4 biomass-based diesel RIN credits, which are crucial for biofuel margins and have recently surged in value to their highest prices in over a year. The more lenient carbon accounting will also help farmers eyeing a long-term future in renewable fuel markets and will support margins for ethanol and biodiesel producers reliant on crops. Corn and soy groups have pushed the government for less punitive emissions tracking, worried that crop demand could wane if refiners could only turn a profit by using lower-carbon waste feedstocks instead. The House bill, if passed, would still run up against contradictory incentives from other governments, including SAF mandates in Europe that restrict fuels from crops and California's efforts to soon limit state low-carbon fuel standard credits for fuels derived from vegetable oils.

EU consults on tariffs for €95bn US imports

Brussels, 9 May (Argus) — The European Commission is consulting on an extensive list, worth €95bn ($107bn), of US industrial, agricultural and other imports that could be subject to tariff countermeasures. The long list includes extends from livestock, biofuels, wood pellets to metals, aircraft, tankers and polymers . The consultation runs until midday on 10 June. It is aimed at stakeholders affected by US measures and possible EU rebalancing measures. Also considered for possible countermeasures are restrictions, worth €4.4bn, on EU exports to the US of steel, iron and aluminium scrap, as well as toluidines, alcoholic solutions and enzymes (CN codes 7204, 7602, 292143, 330210 and 350790). The commission linked the possible new measures to US universal tariffs and to Washington's specific tariffs on cars and car parts. The commission said the public consultation is a necessary procedural step. It does not automatically result in countermeasures. The EU also launched a WTO dispute procedure against the US for Washington's universal tariffs, set at 20pc for EU goods and currently paused at 10pc, and at 25pc on all imports of vehicles and car parts. The commission will need approval by EU governments under a simplified legislative procedure. Officials say this will complete a legal act for the countermeasures, making them ""ready to use"" if talks with the US do not produce a ""satisfactory"" result. The list of products potentially targeted includes livestock, along with items ranging from spectacles to antiques. The 218-page list includes a range of agricultural and food products including oats, maize, and cereal pellets. Also included are biodiesel and wood pellets (CN codes 38260010, 44013100), as well as paper and cotton products. Aluminium, iron, steel are listed together with a wide range of other goods from gas turbines, ships propellers and blades, aircraft, sea-going tankers and other vessels. Polymers, copolymers, polyesters and other products are not spared (CN codes 39039090 and more). On 10 April, the EU paused its reciprocal tariffs against the US for 90 days, responding to a US pause. The EU notes that €379bn, or 70pc, of the bloc's exports to the US are currently subject to new or paused tariffs.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -United Airlines (UAL) may not take delivery of the Boeing (BA) 737 MAX 10 until 2027 or 2028 because of uncertainty about when the plane will be approved for use, an executive for the carrier said Tuesday.

Boeing has faced significant delays in getting the smaller MAX 7 certified, which must happen before the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration can then certify the larger MAX 10.

United Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella told reporters on the sidelines of an event that the airline is taking MAX 9 airplanes as it waits for the certification of the 10.

""In supply chain terms, we want to make sure we get our aircraft so we've committed to the MAX 9,"" Nocella said. ""Until we know the MAX 10 is going to be delivered, we don't want to have an aircraft that doesn't arrive.""

Nocella said United may not achieve its earlier goal of being one of the first delivery customers for the MAX 10.

""We want to see the aircraft certified before we make the firm commitment to convert our 9s to 10s.""

Boeing did not immediately comment.

In 2017, United made a major order of the MAX 10, which is larger and can carry more passengers. The 737 is Boeing's top-selling airliner. The FAA has currently capped production of the MAX at 38 planes per month after a 2024 mid-air emergency.

The FAA must approve an engine de-icing fix for the MAX 7 before it can certify the plane after Boeing in January 2024 withdrew a waiver request.

Alaska Airlines (ALK) told Reuters last year it did not expect to receive 737 MAX 10 airplanes until at least mid-2026.

Nocella said there is no end in sight to supply chain issues on engines and other parts.

The new 787-9 with updated interior ""should have been announced six months ago"" but for supply chain problems, he said, adding: ""I don't have a crystal ball, I can't tell you when it's going to be fixed.""

The test campaign involved high pressure turbine (HPT) blades and nozzles with the GE’s latest cooling technology that demonstrated improved durability and fuel efficiency compared to conventional turbine technology. The airfoils were inserted in the core of an F110 engine for testing.

Two test campaigns were conducted, with the first starting in 2023 focusing on initial performance validation. A second endurance campaign completed earlier this year simulated high-thrust takeoff and climb conditions to evaluate how components would withstand flight conditions.

“With endurance tests conducted on new high-pressure turbine blade cooling technologies, it shows the CFM RISE program’s early focus on durability and reliability,” said Arjan Hegeman, vice president of future of flight engineering for GE Aerospace. “This is the earliest in new technology development that we’ve done durability tests, incorporating the experience of our commercial aircraft engines flying today.”

The tests validated the thermal, mechanical and system performance of the HPT hardware, with the airfoils located in the engine’s hottest section subjected to extreme operating conditions. The next phase of testing will involve dust ingestion testing to evaluate turbine blade behavior in severe environments.

GE Aerospace is developing the compact engine core including high-pressure compressor, HPT blades and combustor technologies for a core demonstrator scheduled to be completed later this decade through the CFM RISE program. The compact core design targets significant improvements in thermal efficiency and power-to-weight ratio compared to current engine architectures.

The RISE (Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines) program, unveiled in 2021, has completed more than 250 tests and is one of the aviation industry’s most comprehensive technology demonstration efforts. Beyond the compact core, RISE is advancing engine architectures including Open Fan and hybrid electric systems.

Technologies are being tested with both conventional and alternative jet fuels, including unblended Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The CFM RISE program is targeting more than 20% better fuel burn compared to the most efficient commercial engines in service today, alongside improved durability and reliability.

Air cargo contributed $69.3 million, or 42.5%, of Anchorage airport revenues in 2024, mostly in landing fees.

Most large cargo planes are capable of flying trans-Pacific and trans-polar routes nonstop, but the economics are still attractive for freight operators to stop in Alaska to refuel. That’s because carrying less fuel allows for more cargo to be carried, maximizing revenue.

But that advantage is threatened in part by technology advances and a requirement from the EU that airlines use a 20% blend of sustainable and conventional fuels by 2035 and 42% by 2045.

Providing cargo carriers with a cost-effective supply of SAF would give them an incentive to continue refueling stops in Alaska even if technology improves the economics of flying nonstop.

""Anchorage is already a critical refueling hub for trans-Pacific cargo, but as aviation technology evolves, we can’t rely on today’s fuel burn vs. payload advantage alone,” said Katharine Keith, Alaska Deputy Commissioner of Transportation and Public Facilities.

“Investing in sustainable aviation fuel gives carriers a long-term reason to keep stopping here -- it’s a hedge against future aircraft designs and market shifts that might otherwise bypass Alaska. Building SAF capacity secures our position in the global air logistics chain,"" she said.

Backed by major airlines

The state is investigating an SAF plant that could meet air carriers’ growing demand. Atlas Air, one of the world’s largest air cargo operators, and Alaska Airlines, a major west coast regional airline and also the state’s largest passenger carrier, are supporting the state’s effort to make SAF for blending with conventional jet fuel.

Keith is leading the initial feasibility assessments. The goal is for a plant to produce 150 million gallons per year of sustainable fuel, which is one-sixth of the current jet fuel demand in Anchorage, along with 80 million to 95 million gallons of Renewable Diesel and Renewable Naphtha. The plan has the backing of Alaska’s governor, Mike Dunleavy, who has a strong interest in renewable energy.

Keith said six other airlines, mostly cargo operators, have written letters to the state supporting the idea. Initial studies show costs for SAF would be less than what the fuel costs elsewhere because of a huge amount of biomass that is available. Organic material like fish oil or forest biomass could be converted to fuel at costs low enough to offset the capital cost of building an SAF plant, which could range from $1 billion to $3 billion, depending on the technology selected, Keith said.

At this point, the Alaska team working on the initial feasibility is looking at two technology paths, Keith said. One is a Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids, or HEFA, process using organic material like fish oil from Alaska seafood processing plants to produce synthetic kerosene for blending. Plants elsewhere producing renewable aviation and diesel fuels mostly use the HEFA process.

The second approach is a Fischer-Tropsch technology that would rely mainly on the large amount of forest biomass available. Fischer-Tropsch process is used today in South Africa to produce fuel from coal and natural gas.

Pulp to power

But there are still uncertainties. “While the FT process is proven, not many FT refineries exist globally, and not with biomass as a feedstock. That, combined with our plan for carbon sequestration, means that many aspects will be new,” Keith said.

“There is a plant similar in feedstock and scale to ours, scheduled to be operational in 2028 in Louisiana,” she said. DG Fuels’ plant, located in St. James Parish, will have a planned capacity of 13,000 b/d of SAF, according to company information.

Keith said Fischer-Tropsch is costly, but with the large volumes of forest material available, Fischer-Tropsch could be more cost-effective than HEFA.

“This was a complete surprise to us because the capital cost would be much higher, but that appears to be offset by the more limited supply of fish oil and the longer transport costs from fish plants compared with the volumes of available wood biomass and the shorter distance from harvest areas,” she said.

Studies also show that Alaska’s fisheries will be able to supply only 9% of a plant’s target output, assuming that only byproducts like fish oil are used. Also, the largest fish processing plants are at a considerable distance from Anchorage. A smaller HEFA plant could still be viable with additional organic feedstock, such as municipal waste.

The forest biomass is closer, mostly within 150 miles of Anchorage in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough and the Kenai Peninsula. Estimates are that 46.2 million dry tons of live and dead timber can be reached within one mile of existing roads. For a target output of 150 million gallons a year of SAF, about 4.9 million dry tons of forest biomass, or 9.8 million green tons (with higher moisture), would be needed.

Infrastructure advantage

The existing fuel infrastructure near Anchorage offers advantages, Keith said. Anchorage’s port has 3.4 million gallons of fuel storage to supply both its airport and Joint Base Elemendorf-Richardson, a nearby military installation. If the SAF plant is built at or near an existing Marathon Petroleum refinery on the Kenai Peninsula, it can use an existing 67-mile liquids pipeline to move the SAF fuel to bulk storage in Anchorage.

An alternative plant site at Port MacKenzie, a short distance from Anchorage across Knik Arm of Upper Cook Inlet, could see the SAF fuel barged to storage facilities at Anchorage’s port.

Converting forest biomass, meanwhile, solves another problem for Alaska because much of it is damaged and dead spruce killed by beetle infestations. This creates a serious fire danger, so removing the damaged timber serves an important public purpose, Keith said.

This could be a double-win for Alaska if the technology and economics work – Alaska gets a reduced wildfire danger along with an anchor for its air carrier refueling industry.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-14 04:56:43.396575

Qantas, Sydney Airport, and Ampol, facilitated the bulk import, alongside Qantas’ Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Coalition partners.

Nearly two million litres of unblended SAF arrived this week, marking a significant step toward reducing aviation’s carbon footprint.

SAF stands as the most promising near-term solution to decarbonize the aviation industry. It offers a sustainable alternative to traditional jet fuel.

Australian Bulk SAF Delivery

On May 7, Ampol imported the SAF from Malaysia to its Kurnell facility. The fuel is now being blended with conventional aviation fuel at an approximate 18% ratio. It will undergo rigorous testing and certification before entering Sydney Airport’s supply chain.

Once certified, it will power flights departing from Sydney over the coming weeks. This volume of SAF could fuel around 900 flights from Sydney to Auckland on Qantas and Jetstar’s 737 aircraft. It will cut carbon emissions by an estimated 3,400 tonnes—equivalent to the annual emissions of about 800 cars.

This milestone highlights the capability of Ampol and Sydney Airport’s existing infrastructure to handle SAF, showing the potential for scaling up its use in Australia.

Developing a Domestic SAF Industry

It also signals growing momentum for establishing a domestic SAF industry, supported by Qantas, the national carrier.

In 2023, Qantas launched the SAF Coalition, uniting 15 major Australian and global companies committed to using SAF at scale to reduce emissions from air travel and freight, which often account for a significant portion of their carbon footprint.

A domestic SAF industry could bring substantial economic benefits. By 2040, it has the potential to contribute A$13 billion annually to Australia’s GDP.

It would support nearly 13,000 jobs in the feedstock supply chain. In addition, it will create 5,000 new jobs to build and operate SAF production facilities. These projections underscore the industry’s promise for economic growth and job creation.

Federal Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, and Local Government, The Hon. Catherine King MP, praised the initiative. “Australia has a unique opportunity to create jobs, industries, and skills by developing a domestic sustainable fuel sector,” she said.

“This import is a vote of confidence in the industry and a clear signal of demand. Our government is committed to supporting this progress as we build Australia’s future.”

Sydney Airport CEO Scott Charlton emphasized the airport’s pivotal role. “As the hub for nearly 40% of Australia’s aviation fuel uplift, Sydney Airport is well-positioned to lead the development of a domestic SAF industry,” he said.

“New South Wales, a major producer of feedstocks like canola, could become a global SAF leader with the right policy support, creating local jobs and fueling more sustainable flights.”

Qantas Group CEO Vanessa Hudson spoke of the criticality of the venture. “A domestic SAF industry is critical to decarbonizing aviation, enhancing fuel security, and creating jobs,” she said.

“This import demonstrates the demand for sustainable travel. As Australia’s national carrier, we’re committed to reducing aviation’s environmental impact, but collaboration with government and industry is essential. With 70% of our fuel uplifted in Australia, we’re eager to work together to scale SAF production.”

Plans for Future SAF Uptake

Qantas aims to source 10% of its fuel from SAF by 2030 and 60% by 2050, aligning with its Net Zero by 2050 goal. The airline currently uses SAF at London Heathrow and is exploring opportunities at other international hubs.

Through its A$400 million climate fund, Qantas is investing in SAF initiatives, including planned biofuel facilities in Queensland and New Zealand and a climate-focused venture capital fund.

Sydney Airport has set an ambitious target for 50% of its fuel uplift to be SAF by 2050. To further this goal, Qantas and Sydney Airport recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to collaborate on developing Australia’s SAF industry.

This landmark SAF import marks a turning point for Australian aviation, demonstrating the feasibility of sustainable fuel and paving the way for a cleaner, greener future.

With industry and government alignment, Australia aims to become a global leader in SAF production, driving economic growth and environmental progress.

This initiative, introduced on 14 May 2025, includes financial mechanisms to stabilize costs and mandates for increased SAF usage, promising job creation and environmental benefits.

New Legislation for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The UK government has taken a significant step towards decarbonizing its aviation sector by introducing new laws aimed at boosting homegrown sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

These measures are designed to position the UK as a global leader in this emerging industry.

The legislation includes a revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) that stabilizes costs for both consumers and the industry, alongside an additional £400,000 in funding to accelerate the testing and market entry of new green fuels.

The SAF Mandate requires at least 10% of jet fuel used in UK flights to be sustainable by 2030, with this figure rising to 22% by 2040.

This mandate supports decarbonization efforts while also creating jobs across various sectors such as engineering, tourism, and hospitality.

Economic and Environmental Benefits

The introduction of these new SAF laws is expected to have far-reaching economic and environmental benefits. By supporting green fuel production, the legislation will create jobs across the UK in sectors like engineering and tourism.

The revenue certainty mechanism is designed to limit ticket price fluctuations to an average of £1.50 per year, protecting consumers from excessive costs while promoting eco-friendly travel options.

Furthermore, the government’s £400,000 funding will help producers bring new sustainable fuels to market faster.

This complements the existing £63 million Advanced Fuels Fund aimed at supporting SAF development. These initiatives are part of a broader effort to make the UK a global hub for clean energy and green aviation.

Opportunities for Growth

Creation of jobs in engineering, tourism, and hospitality through green fuel production

Stabilization of ticket prices with minimal annual increases due to RCM

Acceleration of sustainable fuel market entry with additional government funding

Legal requirement for increased use of sustainable fuels in UK flights by 2030

Positioning the UK as a leader in clean energy and green aviation globally

International Implications

The UK’s leadership in SAF production not only strengthens its domestic economy but also enhances its geopolitical influence in climate policy and clean energy markets worldwide.

By fostering a domestic SAF industry, the country reduces reliance on fossil fuels and imports while encouraging other nations to adopt similar mandates.

This commitment could spur innovation in SAF technologies globally while ensuring that international airlines operating within the UK comply with new fuel requirements.

As such developments unfold, they may impact global supply chains positively.

In Conclusion

The UK’s ambitious plans for sustainable aviation fuel mark a pivotal moment for both its economy and environment.

By setting stringent targets for SAF usage alongside supportive financial mechanisms, these initiatives promise significant job creation while reducing carbon emissions—positioning Britain as an influential player within global efforts toward greener skies.

Aemetis Inc. released first quarter financial results on May 8, reporting increased biogas production, progress with efficiency improvements at the company’s ethanol plant, and resumed biodiesel deliveries. Financing activities are also underway for a proposed sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project.

During an earnings call, Aemetis Chairman and CEO Eric McAfee explained that the company’s renewable natural gas (RNG) business is quickly scaling production. Capacity is currently expected to reach 550,000 MMBtu this year, increasing to 1 million MMBtu annually by the end of 2026.

According to McAfee, Aemetis Biogas is now operating or building projects at 18 dairies, with four dairy RNG projects slated to come online early this summer. Third-party verification has been completed on seven dairy pathways under the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard. Those pathways are currently undergoing final review at the California Air Resources Board.

McAfee also noted offsite construction has begun on a mechanical vapor recompression (MVP) system that will be installed at the company’s ethanol plant in Keyes, California. Once operational, the MVP system is expected to reduce natural use at the facility by 80%.

Regarding the ethanol market, McAfee said pricing has improved since earlier this year. The U.S. EPA’s announcement it will issue emergency waivers allowing continued E15 sales this summer provides tailwinds for margin expansion, he added.

In addition to its U.S.-based biogas and ethanol operations, Aemetis also operates a biodiesel facility in India. According to McAfee, the company resumed biodiesel deliveries to government oil companies in April. He also noted Aemetis is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) of its India subsidiary, targeting late 2025 or early 2026. In addition, Aemetis is evaluating expanding its India operations to include RNG and ethanol production.

McAfee also provided a brief update of Aemetis’ proposed 90 MMgy Riverbank project, which aims to produce SAF and renewable diesel. He said the company is in active discussions on financing structures and is awaiting further clarity on the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit and state-level SAF mandates to support project financing.

The Riverbank project also features a proposed carbon capture and storage (CCS) project. According to McAfee, the company has completed initial drilling and pipe installation for its CO2 characterization well. Data obtained from the next phase of drilling with support permitting efforts.

Aemetis reported total revenues of $42.9 million for the first quarter, down from $72.6 million reported for the same period of last year. The company attributed the decline to delays in the receipt of contracts in India from government-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs). New OMC letters of intent for $31 million were issue din April and shipments started the same month.

The Keyes plant increased revenues by $1.7 million. The increase is primarily attributed to the increase in average selling price of ethanol. The dairy RNG segment sold 70,900 MMBtu of RNG during the three-month period, up 10,100 MMbtu when compared to the first quarter of 2024.

Gross loss for the first quarter was $5.1 million, compared to a gross loss of $600,000 reported for the same period of last year. Operating loss was $15.6 million, compared to an operating loss of $9.5 million. Net loss was $24.5 million, compared to a net loss of $24.2 million.

Jill Greer, Wheels Up's executive vice president, investor relations and sustainability, commented, ""We are delighted to launch our Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) program.","Wheels Up Experience Inc., a global leader in private aviation, on May 6 announced the launch of its new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) program. Now, Wheels Up charter customers who opt into this initiative are able to seamlessly book a private jet or group charter flight and contribute towards decarbonizing aviation by supporting SAF.

Wheels Up will partner with Delta Air Lines to purchase SAF, ultimately allowing private fliers to participate regardless of their flight operator or departure airport.

What is SAF?

SAF is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel, derived from more sustainable feedstocks. SAF is developed through advanced processes that significantly reduce its carbon footprint over the fuel's lifecycle, as compared to traditional fossil-based jet fuel.

SAF is significant in its drop-in capability, meaning it can be blended with traditional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft engines without modification. By using SAF in this immediate and practical way, airlines can achieve up to an 80% reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions.

How does this SAF Program work

While SAF is expected to play a critical role in decarbonizing aviation, it remains scarce today – in 2024, it only accounted for 0.3% of global jet fuel production, and it has very limited availability.

In this context, it is impractical to ensure that every customer wishing to 'fly on SAF' has physical SAF at their airport, much less loaded into their specific flights. Through Wheels Up's program, charter customers determine the amount of SAF they wish to support, and Wheels Up coordinates with Delta to direct customer contributions through the Delta SAF Program.

By integrating SAF into Wheels Up's charter infrastructure, Wheels Up and its customers have the opportunity to help increase the demand for SAF. Such market frameworks are anticipated to play a critical role in scaling SAF production and use in the coming years.

To support this initiative, Wheels Up has partnered with Chooose, a leading software platform specializing in lower-carbon aviation solutions.

Commitment to Sustainability

With the launch of this SAF program, Wheels Up is taking a proactive step towards helping to reduce aviation's carbon footprint. This introduction empowers customers to make more sustainable travel choices and contribute towards decarbonizing aviation by supporting SAF.

Jill Greer, Wheels Up's executive vice president, investor relations and sustainability, commented, ""We are delighted to launch our Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) program. As demand for ESG-conscious travel options grows, this initiative allows our customers to take meaningful steps toward reducing their carbon footprint, while reinforcing Wheels Up's commitment to sustainable aviation.""

Charlotte Lollar, director of sustainable aviation fuel at Delta Air Lines, added, ""We are pleased to collaborate with Wheels Up to provide access to Delta's SAF supply. Through this new partnership, we're able to offer charter customers a traceable and scalable way to contribute to reducing aviation emissions - even when traveling in locations where SAF is not readily available. We are excited to continue to propel the industry forward toward more sustainable aviation solutions.""",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Wheels_Up_May25_2211113cdf.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 21:56:34.655809

“This is a hit to Iowa corn growers and ethanol producers. The decision to ban carbon capture and sequestration projects cuts off our ability to tap into markets for ultra-low carbon ethanol and puts Iowa corn growers at a disadvantage compared to states pursuing CCS projects. Iowa has long been known as the corn state, and this decision impacts our ability to stay competitive as other states and countries seize this new opportunity. Our farmers deserve increased market access, not increased barriers. ICGA is disheartened by this decision but appreciates the support of Senate members who voted in the interest of the Iowa farmer.”

Additional Background:

Production of corn continues to outpace demand. USDA is estimating we will have 1.8 billion bushels of excess corn at the end of the 2025-26 crop year. If this bill is signed by the Governor, it would destroy the opportunity to pursue massive new ethanol markets like Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Worldwide jet fuel demand is projected to be at 120 billion gallons by 2035. If just 10% of that market could be made into SAF from ethanol, this would equate to nearly 19 billion gallons of new ethanol demand or nearly 6.5 billion bushels of new corn demand. That is more than 1.5 times the amount of corn grown in Iowa today.

Other states in the U.S. are implementing CCS technology. South American already has a significantly lower carbon score for corn ethanol and is also considering CCS to lower it further. The result of this will be these states and South America will become the market for low carbon ethanol. Iowa will no longer be the most competitive place to produce ethanol. Plants will be forced to stop expansion plans and ultimately will pay less for corn and that will mean less profitability for Iowa’s corn farmers.",https://www.croplife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Corn-Closeup.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 22:57:01.220965

With decarbonisation key to accelerating expansion plans, the government has also announced an additional £400,000 of funding for producers so that new clean fuels can get to market quicker, speeding up the UK’s path to green flying.

SAF is an alternative to fossil jet fuel, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions on average by 70% on a lifecycle basis. While the fuel is more costly to produce than jet fuel, the government’s SAF measures protect industry and consumers from excessive costs.

In addition, the revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) will keep ticket price changes minimal – keeping fluctuations to £1.50 a year on average – and will be industry funded through a levy on aviation fuel suppliers. The Department for Transport (DfT) will continue to engage with industry on the details of the RCM, including pricing.

A new round of government funding is also being announced, to offer fuel producers a share of £400,000 to support the testing and qualification of green fuels, helping to get them to market quicker. This support for producers follows £63 million of funding made available through the Advanced Fuels Fund this year.

Taken together, the government’s commitments on green fuels will help deliver on its missions to kickstart economic growth via job creation, become a clean energy superpower and will allow the UK to go further and faster with expansion plans, giving a boon to the tourism industry.

Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, said:

I want to see a golden age for green aviation and today sees take off for sustainable flights.

Aviation continues to be one of the fastest growing and most integral parts of the UK’s economy, offering more jobs across engineering, tourism and hospitality – and as we support aviation expansion, we need to move at full throttle towards decarbonisation.

We are making the UK one of the best places in the world to produce sustainable aviation fuel, putting the pedal down on growth and boosting job opportunities across the country as part of the Plan for Change.

The new legislation will help industry meet its requirements under the SAF Mandate, introduced in January this year, which specifies that at least 10% of all jet fuel used in flights taking off from the UK from 2030, be made with sustainable fuel, rising to 22% by 2040.

The new financial mechanism is another display that the UK is rock solid in its commitment to building a prosperous hub for homegrown sustainable fuel production. Furthermore, this vital update provides SAF producers and the industry at large the confidence and stability to plough investment into clean energy.

The government’s approach on low carbon fuels could add up to £5 billion to the economy by 2050 and position the UK as a global hub for SAF production.

Tim Alderslade, Chief Executive of Airlines UK, said:

This is a welcome announcement given the importance of the RCM to commercialising and scaling-up SAF production in the UK, a technology key to decarbonising aviation by 2050. A UK SAF industry, kick-started by the RCM and SAF Mandate, can create tens of thousands of jobs across the country whilst supporting our world-class aviation sector to deliver economic growth.

We look forward to working with government on scheme design and how contracts are allocated, so that we balance the need to deliver the SAF required to support mandate compliance, whilst keeping costs as low as possible through a competitive and transparent bidding process that places the consumer at its heart.

Duncan McCourt, Chief Executive of Sustainable Aviation, said:

We hugely welcome the publication of this important legislation. SAF is a crucial element in the plan to decarbonise aviation as it can be used in existing aircraft with existing infrastructure.

The challenge now is to scale the industry, ensuring we have enough SAF to meet the mandate whilst keeping costs low and create thousands of jobs in the process. This legislation will help to do that.",https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/682362a47b63976092644ade/s960_aviation-fueling-960.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 19:57:04.916826

Abstract

Biofuels induced land-use change (ILUC) emissions have been widely studied over the past 15 years. Many studies have addressed uncertainties associated with these estimates. These studies have broadly examined uncertainties associated with the choice of economic models, their assumptions and parameters, and a few bio-physical variables. However, uncertainties in land-use emission factors that represent the soil and vegetation carbon contents of various land types across the world and are used to estimate carbon fluxes due to land conversions are mostly overlooked. This paper calls attention to this important omission. It highlights some important sources of uncertainty in land-use emissions factors, explores the range in these factors from established data sources, and compares the influence of their variability on ILUC emissions for several sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pathways. The estimated land-use changes for each pathway are taken from a well-known computable general equilibrium model, GTAP-BIO. Two well-known carbon calculator models (CCLUB and AEZ-EF) that represent two different sets of emissions factors are used to convert the GTAP-BIO estimated land-use changes to ILUC emissions. The results show that the calculated ILUC emissions obtained from these carbon calculators for each examined SAF pathway are largely different, even for the same amortization time horizon. For example, the ILUC emissions values obtained from the AEZ-EF and CCLUB models for producing jet fuel from corn ethanol for a 25-year amortization period are 24.9 gCO2e/MJ and 15.96 gCO2e/MJ, respectively. This represents a 60% difference between the results of these two carbon calculators for the same set of land-use changes. The results show larger differences for other pathways as well.",https://www.anl.gov/sites/www/themes/custom/anl_public_theme/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-13 21:56:38.675860

Key View

We anticipate that Mainland China’s exports of Used Cooking Oil (UCO) will decline in 2025.

Several factors are expected to drive a downturn in Mainland China’s UCO exports through 2025 and beyond. Initially, we foresee a significant drop in US demand for Chinese UCO.

Secondly, we anticipate that Mainland China will prioritise the production and export of SAF over feedstock exports.

The US is likely to increasingly prioritise domestically sourced feedstocks, which could impact biofuel producer margins. However, unless there is a change in the current 45z tax credit, we anticipate that traditional US feedstock sources, like soybean, will continue to be supplanted by alternatives such as UCO and tallow.

Mainland China’s strategic pivot in the biofuel market reflects a significant shift in its energy policy. As global demand for sustainable energy rises, China has witnessed declining exports of used cooking oil (UCO), a once-popular feedstock for biodiesel production. This decline has forced the nation to reconsider its reliance on UCO and to explore alternative sources, particularly in response to increasing international competition and stringent environmental regulations.

In contrast to UCO, the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is gaining momentum in China’s biofuel strategy. SAF, derived from renewable biomass and waste sources, presents a promising solution to meet the country’s carbon-neutral goals while addressing aviation’s growing emissions. As the global aviation sector pivots toward greener alternatives, China is positioning itself to be a key player in the SAF market, investing in technologies and infrastructure to support large-scale production.",https://i0.wp.com/www.thailand-business-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Mainland-Chinas-Strategic-Shift-Decreasing-UCO-Exports-and-the-Growth.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 22:57:05.027573

H. Con. Res. 14, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025, instructed the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to recommend legislative changes that would decrease deficits by a specific amount over the 2025-2034 period. As part of the reconciliation process, the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure approved legislation on April 30, 2025, with provisions that would decrease deficits.

Estimated Federal Cost

In CBO’s estimation, the reconciliation recommendations of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure would decrease deficits by $36.6 billion over the 2025‑2034 period. The estimated budgetary effects of the legislation are shown in Table 1. The costs of the legislation fall within budget functions 400 (transportation), 500 (education, training, employment, and social services), 700 (veterans benefits and services), and 800 (general government).

Return to Reference

Basis of Estimate

For this estimate, CBO assumes that the legislation will be enacted in summer 2025. CBO’s estimates are relative to its January 2025 baseline and cover the period from 2025 through 2034. Outlays of appropriated amounts were estimated using historical obligation and spending rates for similar programs. CBO’s estimate incorporates administrative and judicial action as of April 10, 2025, the date that H. Con. Res. 14 was approved by the Congress.

Direct Spending

Enacting the bill would increase direct spending by $27.8 billion over the 2025-2034 period (see Table 2), CBO estimates. Most of that amount would result from specified direct appropriations for activities of the Coast Guard and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), offset by a reduction in direct spending from funds rescinded from transportation projects and programs involving federal buildings.

Coast Guard Assets Necessary to Secure the Maritime Border and Interdict Migrants and Drugs

Section 100001 would appropriate $21.2 billion for the Coast Guard to acquire, procure, and improve equipment and facilities, as follows:

$14.6 billion for vessels, including offshore patrol cutters, polar security cutters, and arctic security cutters;

$3.2 billion for shoreside infrastructure;

$2.0 billion for aircraft; and

$1.5 billion for other activities, including $500 million to acquire, procure, or construct a floating dry dock at the Coast Guard Yard in Baltimore, Maryland.

Based on historical spending patterns for similar projects, and using information from the Coast Guard, CBO estimates that enacting section 100001 would increase outlays by $19.6 billion over the 2025-2034 period.

Changes to Mandatory Benefits Programs to Allow Selected Reserve Orders for Preplanned Missions to Secure Maritime Borders and Interdict Persons and Drugs

Section 100002 would authorize the Coast Guard to place members of the Selected Reserve on active duty under certain circumstances. That time would count toward the reservists’ entitlement for benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill; those benefits are paid from mandatory appropriations. Accounting for the increased benefits some reservists and their dependents would receive and using information from the Coast Guard, CBO estimates that each year, 250 reservists, on average, would accrue about six months of additional active duty that would be counted toward their eligibility.

Using information from the Department of Veterans Affairs, CBO estimates that the longer time reservists spend on active duty would increase direct spending by $9 million over the 2025-2034 period.

Vessel Tonnage Duties

Section 100003 would increase tonnage duties on vessels entering the United States. Those charges are levied by Customs and Border Protection and recorded in the budget as offsetting receipts (that is, as reductions in direct spending). In general, the bill would increase tonnage duty rates by 125 percent relative to rates under current law. In 2024, the government collected about $33 million in such charges.

CBO estimates that the higher rate would increase collections (and reduce direct spending) by about $38 million per year relative to current law, totaling $343 million over the 2025‑2034 period.

Registration Fee on Motor Vehicles

Section 100004 would appropriate $104 million in 2026 to support states as they implement systems for collecting registration fees for electric and hybrid vehicles. Those collections are discussed below in the section on Revenues.

Based on historical spending patterns for similar programs, CBO estimates that enacting this section would increase outlays by $102 million over the 2025-2034 period.

Motor Carrier Data

Section 100006 would appropriate $5 million to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to create a public website for tracking motor carriers’ compliance with the agency’s operating requirements. The provision also would allow FMCSA to collect fees from entities that access the website, which could be spent without further appropriation. Those collections are discussed below in the section on Revenues.

CBO estimates that enacting this section would increase outlays by $20 million over the 2025-2034 period, reflecting spending of the direct appropriation ($5 million) and the collected fees ($15 million).

Rescissions

Section 100007 would rescind funds from seven programs established under the 2022 reconciliation act with the following purposes:

Support development of sustainable aviation fuel;

Support projects to improve walkability, safety, and transportation access in disadvantaged communities;

Convert General Services Administration (GSA) facilities to high-performing green buildings;

Install low-carbon materials in GSA facilities;

Support use of emerging technologies for environmental programs in GSA facilities;

Support environmental review for transportation projects; and

Support development of low-carbon transportation materials.

CBO estimates that enacting this section would reduce budget authority by $5.2 billion and outlays by $4 billion over the 2025-2034 period.

Air Traffic Control Staffing and Modernization

Section 100008 would appropriate $12.5 billion for the FAA to construct, acquire, improve, and operate various facilities and equipment as follows:

$7.8 billion for radar and telecommunications systems;

$2.2 billion for air traffic control facilities;

$1.0 billion for air traffic controller recruitment, retention, and training; and

$1.6 billion for other activities, including runway safety projects and unstaffed infrastructure.

Based on historical spending patterns for similar projects and using information from the FAA, CBO estimates that enacting this section would increase outlays by $12.0 billion over the 2025-2034 period.

John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts Appropriations

Section 100009 would appropriate $257 million for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, increasing outlays by the same amount over the 2025-2034 period.

Revenues

Enacting the bill would increase revenues by $64 billion over the 2025-2034 period (see Table 2). Almost all of that would be collected in registration fees on electric and hybrid vehicles under section 100004.

Registration Fee on Motor Vehicles

Sections 100004 and 100005 would require states to collect annual registration fees of $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrid vehicles, through September 30, 2035, and to deposit those collections into the Highway Trust Fund. States would be required to remit 99 percent of the collected fees to the federal government, retaining up to 1 percent to cover administrative costs associated with collections. The Federal Highway Administration would be directed to withhold apportionments from the Highway Trust Fund for states that do not collect and remit the fees. Starting in fiscal year 2027, the withheld amount would be 125 percent of the amount required to be remitted.

CBO expects that states would generally enact the necessary legislative or administrative measures to implement and collect the required fees within a few years of enactment and would comply with the remittance requirements. Proceeds from the collections would be deposited into the Highway Trust Fund; outlays from the fund are controlled by annual obligation limitations and therefore are considered discretionary.

Indirect taxes and regulatory fees tend to reduce collections of income and payroll taxes. As a result, CBO expects that the new fee collections would be partially offset by decreases in tax receipts of about 25 percent of the gross fee collections each year. CBO estimates that enacting sections 100004 and 100005 would increase revenues, on net, by $64 billion over the 2025-2034 period.

Motor Carrier Data

Section 100006 would authorize FMCSA to charge an annual fee of $100 for access to a website that would track motor carriers’ compliance with FMCSA’s operating requirements. Under the provision, brokers and similar entities would be considered to have exercised reasonable and prudent care in engaging motor carriers if they use the website to verify a carrier’s compliance status.

When they are collected by the federal government under its sovereign authority, fees are considered revenues. CBO considers a determination that an entity has acted in a “reasonable and prudent” manner as a matter of law to be an exercise of sovereign authority, so those access fees would be considered revenues.

Based on expected participation rates, and accounting for the offset for indirect taxes, CBO estimates that the collection of access fees would increase federal revenues, on net, by $12 million over the 2025-2034 period.

Uncertainty

Many of CBO’s estimates for the budgetary effects of enacting title X are subject to uncertainty because they rely on underlying projections and other estimates that are themselves difficult to estimate.

Several areas in particular are difficult to estimate:

The amounts collected in tonnage duties under section 100003 could vary from CBO’s estimates because the volume of goods imported into the United States is uncertain. CBO also cannot predict changes in tariffs or certain other factors that would affect the volume of imported goods.

Revenues collected for registrations of electric and hybrid vehicles under section 100004 could differ from estimated amounts if states begin to collect fees more quickly or slowly than CBO expects, or if there are more or fewer registrations than expected under current law.

Pay-As-You-Go Considerations

The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. The net changes in outlays and revenues that are subject to those pay-as-you-go procedures are shown in Table 1.

Increase in Long-Term Net Direct Spending and Deficits

CBO estimates that enacting the legislation would not increase net direct spending or on‑budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2035.

Mandates

The reconciliation recommendations included in title X of the legislation would impose intergovernmental and private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). CBO estimates that the total cost of those mandates would exceed the thresholds established in UMRA for intergovernmental and private-sector mandates ($103 million and $206 million in 2025, respectively, adjusted annually for inflation).

Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Fees

Section 100004 would require the owners of electric and hybrid vehicles to remit annual registration fees, which would impose intergovernmental and private-sector mandates on the owners of those vehicles. The requirement would include some light-duty vehicles owned by state and local governments, including schools, universities, and other public entities that are subject to state registration requirements. The legislation would exclude some commercial vehicles from the fee.

CBO estimates that the cost of the mandate would exceed $10 billion each year once the policy has been fully implemented. The cost for intergovernmental entities to comply with the mandate would exceed the threshold starting in 2029 and remain above it each year through 2034. As a result of the legislation, to avoid paying the registration fees, some states could choose to modify their registration requirements for government-owned vehicles.

The section would impose an additional intergovernmental mandate by requiring states to administer and collect the fees on behalf of the federal government. States would update their registration processes unless an alternative is approved by the administrator of FMCSA. The legislation would provide a onetime grant to states to implement the policy and allow them to retain a portion of the remittances to cover administrative costs. For states unable to recover credit and debit card fees from vehicle registration remittances, CBO estimates that the requirement would result in a net loss of several million dollars in revenue each year.

Motor Carriers

Section 100006 would require FMCSA to establish a website that would provide information to brokers and similar entities on the status of a motor carrier’s compliance with FMCSA operational requirements. That provision would impose a private-sector mandate by limiting the rights of action that petitioners may make against brokers. Currently, when a motor carrier causes injuries or property damage, a petitioner may challenge whether the broker exercised due care in selecting the carrier. Under the legislation, brokers using that site will be considered to have exercised due care in selecting a motor carrier. The cost of the mandate would be any monetary damages that would not be awarded as a result. CBO cannot estimate the cost of the mandate because it would depend on the outcome of future litigation.

Coast Guard Selected Reserve

Section 100002 would expand the scope of an existing intergovernmental and private-sector mandate on employers. That section would extend the employment protections of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 to members of the Coast Guard Selected Reserve who are placed on active duty. Employers would be required to treat those reservists as furloughed employees or employees on a leave of absence, which would entitle them to any compensation or benefits otherwise available to them in that status. Upon their return from active duty, employers would be required to provide them with the same benefits, pay, and seniority as though they had not been deployed. The cost of the mandate would be the cost to employers that provide those benefits. CBO expects that each year the provision would affect 250 reservists, on average. The cost for public and private employers would be small.

About SAF Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is an industry umbrella term that covers a range of non-conventional fuels made from a variety of biogenic and non-biogenic feedstocks and processing technologies.","Qantas, Sydney Airport and Ampol, supported by Qantas’ SAF Coalition partners, have today marked the largest ever commercial importation of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into Australia, with nearly two million litres of unblended SAF arriving this week. Sustainable Aviation Fuel has the greatest near-term potential to help decarbonise the aviation industry.

The fuel was imported by Ampol from Malaysia to its Kurnell facility on Wednesday 7 May and is currently being blended with conventional aviation fuel before testing and certification so that it can be distributed into the Sydney airport supply chain. It will then be used on flights departing from Sydney Airport over the coming weeks.

Once blended at a ratio of approximately 18%¹, the fuel could power the equivalent of 900 flights from Sydney to Auckland on Qantas and Jetstar’s 737 aircraft, reducing the resulting carbon emissions from those flights by a total estimated 3,400 tonnes². This is roughly equivalent to the annual emissions generated by 800 cars.

This import demonstrates the capability of Ampol and Sydney Airport’s existing infrastructure to handle SAF, as well as the growing momentum behind establishing the production of SAF and a viable industry in Australia, backed by the national carrier.

Qantas established the SAF Coalition in 2023 which consists of 15 leading Australian and global companies, all supporting the use of SAF at scale to help reduce their air travel and freight emissions, further demonstrating the demand for SAF that exists across industries. Air travel and freight can make up a significant part of the Coalition partners’ emissions.

If established, domestic SAF production has the potential to contribute approximately A$13B in GDP annually by 2040, while supporting nearly 13,000 jobs in the feedstock supply chain and creating 5,000 new jobs to construct and run the facilities³.

The Hon. Catherine King MP, Federal Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government said: “More than anywhere in the world, Australia has the opportunity to create new jobs, new industries and new skills through developing a domestic sustainable fuel industry – and our government is committed to providing the support to get there.

“Today’s announcement is a positive step in the right direction; a vote of confidence in the sector and a signal that demand is there.

“We made progress in our first term of government to develop a low carbon liquid fuel industry on our shores, and we look forward to building on that work as we build Australia’s future.”

The Hon. Penny Sharpe MLC, NSW Minister for Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Heritage, said: “I applaud this action to reduce emissions from the aviation industry to lay the groundwork for the net zero future of the sector.

""We want to see a strong domestic SAF industry here in NSW, which is a win-win for jobs, fuel security and the planet.”

Scott Charlton, Sydney Airport CEO, said: “Sydney Airport accounts for nearly 40 percent of Australia’s total aviation fuel uplift, so we have a big opportunity to be a leader in the development of a domestic SAF industry.

“NSW is uniquely placed to develop this industry, as a major producer of important feedstocks like canola. Most of Australia’s canola harvest currently goes offshore to be turned into biofuels by other nations.

“With the right policy settings at a state and federal level, and governments working in partnership with industry, NSW can become a global leader on SAF - creating local jobs, supporting local industry, and fuelling more sustainable flights in the future.”

Vanessa Hudson, Qantas Group CEO, said: “The creation of a domestic sustainable aviation fuel industry is key to our efforts towards the decarbonisation of aviation, increasing Australia’s fuel security and creating thousands of new jobs across our economy.

“Today’s announcement is a proud moment for Qantas and demonstrates the demand that exists for more sustainable travel. As the national carrier, we have a role to play in reducing the impact of air travel on the environment, but we can’t do it alone. We pick up 70% of our fuel in Australia so we’re looking forward to working closely with the government to chart the next course for SAF in Australia. The alignment of industry and government will be critical to establishing and scaling an industry here.”

Matthew Halliday, Ampol Managing Director and CEO, said: “This delivery marks Ampol's first major import of Sustainable Aviation Fuel into Australia and leverages our advanced supply chain infrastructure to deliver this product directly from a key domestic fuel terminal to the nation's busiest airport.

""This milestone highlights the critical role of collaboration in developing the SAF industry in Australia and demonstrates how industry can work hand-in-hand.

""This initiative is yet another step towards realising our ambition of establishing domestic renewable fuels capability at our Lytton Refinery in Brisbane.”

Mark Davies, General Manager Premium Services and International, Australia Post, said: “The SAF Coalition was established to enable large entities like Australia Post to take real and tangible action toward reducing our Scope 3 emissions, acknowledging we have a role to play in supporting the decarbonisation of transport industries.

“As Qantas’ largest domestic freight partner, we recognise the importance of driving progress across our sector. The SAF Coalition is key to advancing local sustainable aviation through cross-industry collaboration and, as a collective, we are taking meaningful action to reduce our emissions and drive the transition to a low-carbon future.”

In line with its Net Zero by 2050 ambition, Qantas is targeting 10% of its fuel use to come from Sustainable Aviation Fuel by 2030 and approximately 60% by 2050.

Qantas currently uplifts SAF from London Heathrow and is exploring opportunities at other international locations. Through its A$400m climate fund, Qantas is also backing several other SAF-focused initiatives, including planned biofuel facilities in Queensland and New Zealand, and a recently announced investment in a climate-focused VC fund.

Sydney Airport has an ambition for 50 percent of the fuel uplift at the airport by 2050 to be SAF.

Sydney Airport and Qantas extend cooperation through MoU

The importation follows the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Qantas and Sydney Airport to work together to further facilitate the development of a domestic SAF industry in Australia.

The MoU and import deal demonstrate the industry’s commitment to SAF across the supply chain – from airlines and airports to corporate customers – which can be practically used today with existing infrastructure to help reduce the emissions of Australian aviation.

Notes to Editors

The Qantas SAF Coalition is a corporate partnership program that enables companies to contribute to the incremental cost of sustainable aviation fuel purchased by Qantas via a “book-and-claim” model, thereby lowering their travel emissions and helping to scale the production and use of SAF globally. Current members include Australia Post, Accenture, ANZ, BCG, Commonwealth Bank, Deloitte, Fortescue, IMC, ING Australia, PwC Australia, Raytheon Australia, Sydney Airport, Woodside Energy, and Xero.

About SAF

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is an industry umbrella term that covers a range of non-conventional fuels made from a variety of biogenic and non-biogenic feedstocks and processing technologies. Biogenic SAF (made from feedstock such as used cooking oils and council waste etc) has the potential to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

Non-biogenic SAF — or synthetic fuel / efuels — utilises carbon dioxide, green hydrogen and renewable electricity to synthesise a liquid fuel which can reduce emissions on a lifecycle basis by up to 90% compared to fossil fuels. Currently SAFs are required to be blended with fossil jet fuel up to a 50% blend limit, but the industry is expected to move towards a 100% SAF blend in the second half of this decade. With Qantas’ goal to reach net zero by 2050, it is entering into partnerships with the aim of accelerating the use of SAF across its fleet and encourage the development of a SAF industry in Australia.",https://www.sydneyairport.com.au/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-13 18:56:25.581437

“Our innovation transforms seawater from a challenge into a solution … This is clean hydrogen made from the sea.”","A new technique can produce clean hydrogen directly from seawater without the need for desalination or added chemicals.

Researchers at the University of Sharjah in the UAE have designed a multi-layered electrode that resists the corrosion and performance degradation typically caused by chloride ions in traditional seawater electrolysis.

Their prototype system was able to sustain industrial-scale hydrogen production for more than 300 hours without any loss in performance. It also achieved a ‘Faradaic efficiency’ of 98%, which means that nearly all the electrical input was converted to hydrogen gas.

By eliminating the need for freshwater and energy-intensive desalination, the technology could enable solar-powered hydrogen farms in arid coastal areas such as those in the UAE, where seawater and sunlight are plentiful but freshwater is scarce.

If scaled up properly, the system could make it easier to produce large quantities of ‘green hydrogen’, produced through electrolysis with using renewable energy.

In contrast, ‘blue hydrogen’ is produced from natural gas via steam methane reforming or autothermal reforming and does not offer as many potential carbon-reduction benefits.

The researchers are currently preparing for pilot-scale testing and are ultimately planning to build a modular, solar-powered hydrogen generator designed for real-world use in harsh environments.

“Traditional methods face a host of problems, mainly corrosion and performance degradation caused by chloride ions in seawater,” said Tanveer Ul Haq, the study’s lead author.

But he says the team’s project has “demonstrated that direct seawater electrolysis is not only possible but scalable, delivering industrial-level efficiency while protecting the electrode over long-term use”.

CINCINNATI – GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE) recently completed more than 3,000 cycles of endurance tests on next-generation high-pressure turbine (HPT) airfoil technologies, another step in the development of a more compact engine core for the future of flight.

The test campaign of HPT blades and nozzles demonstrated improved durability and fuel efficiency compared to conventional turbine technology, important for customer operations. Endurance tests look to simulate high-thrust takeoff and climb to see how parts would withstand flight conditions. Earlier tests initially focused on validating thermal, mechanical, and system performance of the HPT hardware.

GE Aerospace is developing a compact engine core including high-pressure compressor, HPT, and combustor technologies for a core demonstrator later this decade through the CFM RISE* program.

“With endurance tests conducted on new high-pressure turbine blade cooling technologies, it shows the CFM RISE program’s early focus on durability and reliability. This is the earliest in new technology development that we’ve done durability tests, incorporating the experience of our commercial aircraft engines flying today,” said Arjan Hegeman, vice president of future of flight engineering for GE Aerospace.

Additional testing is planned. The next step is to run dust ingestion testing to evaluate how the turbine blades located in the hottest section of the engine behave in severe environments.

Real progress

Unveiled in 2021, the CFM RISE program is one of the aviation industry’s most comprehensive technology demonstrators showing real progress with more than 250 tests completed.

The RISE program is advancing a suite of pioneering technologies. In addition to the compact core, these include engine architectures like Open Fan and hybrid electric systems. Technologies are being tested with conventional and alternative jet fuels, such as unblended Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The CFM RISE program targets more than 20% better fuel burn and improved durability and reliability compared to the most efficient commercial engines in service today.

Combining all of these factors, Natilus is developing commercial aircraft that are more sustainable and fuel-efficient than ever before.
Additionally, over the next 20 years, the global demand for new narrowbody commercial aircraft is expected to exceed 40,000 planes.
Natilus’s BWB aircraft offer major advantages in sustainability, delivering a 30% reduction in fuel consumption and 50% decrease in carbon emissions.
Natilus has spent the past nine years developing the technology, fostering the talent and creating a customer pipeline to commercialize BWB aircraft.","Natilus, also known as the 'Boeing killer', is redefining the skyscape with its blended-wing-body planes. According to CEO, Aleksey Matyushev, consumers can expect to step aboard as early as 2030. Robbie Hodges reports

In just a decade, the typical commercial plane – tube and two wings – could seem nothing more than an anachronism. That is, at least, if Natilus’ vision comes to life. The aviation pioneers are known for their unique blended-wing-body (BWB) design, more akin to a stingray than a bird, which it claims is the world’s most energy efficient commercial aircraft.

2025 is an exciting year for the company. In March, it officially announced that it was looking for a new manufacturing facility in the US that would enable the company to build models at scale. As the tariff war takes hold with implications for steel and aluminium imports, Natilus hopes to provide US-based carriers with locally-made aircraft. The facility will produce KONA, Natilus’s regional BWB freighter plane, and will eventually be built out to produce its 200-passenger aircraft, HORIZON.

And what better time for expansion? After a slew of media scandals that eroded consumer trust in Boeing and Airbus, there’s a market opportunity for a radical newcomer to provide an alternative to commercial aircrafts. Globetrender talked to the company’s CEO, Aleksey Matyushev about plans for the future and why he thinks the 2030s will mark a historic turning point for commercial aviation.

Which problems in the aviation sector does Natilus aim to solve?

The aviation industry generates more than 900 million metric tons of CO2 per year globally – a number projected to peak this decade. To meet the International Air Transport Association (IATA)’s resolution to fly net zero by 2050, airlines and aircraft manufacturers are facing a reckoning to rethink their operations. While sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a promising solution, the effort is years from commercialization.

With Natilus’s innovative BWB design, its family of aircraft offers a 50% reduction in carbon emissions compared to traditional planes. Natilus delivers step-change technology improvements, independent of incremental advancements on the powertrain and fuel source, offering a 30% reduction in fuel consumption that can be stacked with SAF and hydrogen propulsion in the coming years. Combining all of these factors, Natilus is developing commercial aircraft that are more sustainable and fuel-efficient than ever before.

Additionally, over the next 20 years, the global demand for new narrowbody commercial aircraft is expected to exceed 40,000 planes. Boeing and Airbus are struggling to keep up with today’s demand, and the deficit is likely to grow as the companies’ supply chain challenges continue.

Commercial airlines are ready to embrace new manufacturers, especially if new aircraft offer a significant reduction in carbon emissions. Positioned to disrupt the Boeing-Airbus duopoly, Natilus will operate faster, leaner and more efficiently to develop next-generation aircraft for a fraction of what it costs today’s OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers).

What are the benefits of flying in BWB models for the consumer; in what tangible ways will the experience seem 'elevated'?

The BWB design offers 30% more floor space than the traditional airplane. Our interior designs are flexible and customizable for each airline – many of which are on the hunt for differentiated offerings for passengers and exploring unique seating configurations and plane layouts. Depending on the airline’s configuration, passengers could see more spacious economy seats, more lie-flat first-class seats or even dedicated configurations catering to business travelers and families. Overall all passengers should expect a quieter flight experience.

For the past decade, much sustainable aviation discourse has revolved around hydrofuels. Do you think tube fuselage planes are compatible with a greener future?

The aviation industry is making incremental progress through sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen fuels – but we need many different approaches to move toward a cleaner future. Natilus’s BWB aircraft offer major advantages in sustainability, delivering a 30% reduction in fuel consumption and 50% decrease in carbon emissions. In our case, Natilus’s HORIZON and KONA will be compatible with SAF and can also work with hydrogen-powered engines from ZeroAvia.

The aviation sector is in the midst of a trust crisis. Natilus Horizon looks (and I imagine feels) very different to the typical passenger plane. What’s your strategy for building consumer trust?

Our first aircraft will be our regional cargo aircraft, the KONA, and the HORIZON will follow soon after. While the HORIZON looks different, both pilots and passengers should expect a similar – yet elevated – experience onboard. Like all commercial aircraft, we will pursue FAA Part 25 Type certification and the HORIZON will meet all the airworthiness standards set by the FAA for transport category airplanes.

Natilus has already created an autonomous cargo plane (operated by the Natilus Pilot Operations Desk). Do you foresee a future of autonomous planes for consumer travel?

KONA will be optionally-piloted, meaning that customers can select for the KONA to be autonomous or human-piloted. At this point, we aren’t focused on developing autonomous planes for consumer travel due to the hurdle with FAA certification. The HORIZON will be human-piloted.

Where do you see Natilus Horizon sitting in the market?

The HORIZON will compete with the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737s, and is designed to operate within the existing gate infrastructure.

When is the HORIZON aircraft expected to hit the market i.e. when can consumers expect to step aboard?

We expect to take the Horizon to the market in the early 2030s. At that time, carriers are expected to make purchasing decisions on their next fleets to meet 2050 net-zero goals.

What market forces have held Natilus back in the past, and does there seem to be more appetite for aviation innovation right now? Why do you think that is?

The aircraft in use today are tube-and-wing designs that have been around for more than half a century. For manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus, the cost to develop a new aircraft is massive. It’s clear the industry needs new entrants to introduce more streamlined, fuel-efficient aircraft for the next half-century.

In light of the frustrations with Boeing and Airbus with delivery delays, airlines are exploring new aircraft manufacturers to navigate potential trade restrictions and supply chain disruptions, especially as tariffs put critical aerospace materials like aluminium and steel at a premium.

With the expansion of trade routes across the globe, the aviation sector needs more efficient and sustainable aircraft for the cargo and passenger markets. As a prime example, Canadian charter airline Nolinor Aviation purchased multiple production slots for Natilus’s regional cargo plane, KONA, due to its ability to operate in rugged terrain and extreme weather. The largest operator of the Boeing 737-200, Nolinor Aviation has turned to Natilus to provide a more sustainable way to reach its target markets in the Canadian Northwest.

Natilus has spent the past nine years developing the technology, fostering the talent and creating a customer pipeline to commercialize BWB aircraft. Right now, we are seeing market interest for the HORIZON driven by commercial airlines looking to reduce costs and emissions in their operations.

What lessons have you learned from the current Boeing/Airbus fiasco?

One of the key lessons we have learned is the critical importance of ensuring that Natilus remains engineering-led throughout development and manufacturing. We have also maintained a sharp focus on the problem we aim to solve and the risks we are prepared to take. For instance, the true innovation Natilus offers lies in the design of the airframe. However, we are not pursuing the development of new engine or avionics technologies. We understand our strengths and leverage a robust supply chain by integrating certified, flight-proven hardware and software.",https://globetrender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Kona_RENDER-1-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:57:13.334436

""Once the Tallgrass CCS pipeline in Nebraska begins operations later this year, that will no longer be the case.
The Iowa legislation will require pipeline companies to prove their projects are insured enough to cover losses and injury during construction.
Among other things, the Iowa bill would limit the operating time of carbon pipelines to 25 years.
OTHER STATE BARRIERS Outside of Iowa, Summit still faces challenges in South Dakota.","LINCOLN, Neb. (DTN) -- The Iowa Legislature moved one step closer on Monday night to make it more difficult for companies to use eminent domain to build carbon pipelines in the state, leaving the future of the proposed Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline connecting to 57 Midwest ethanol plants further clouded.

Summit's proposed 2,500-mile, $8.9 billion pipeline is an important part of helping ethanol producers lower their carbon footprints enough to make ethanol more attractive as a feedstock to produce sustainable aviation fuel.

The pipeline would transport carbon emissions from ethanol plants in Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, South Dakota and North Dakota, to underground storage in North Dakota.

House 639 passed by the Iowa Senate, changes the definition of what it means to be a common carrier in the state. The definition is key in determining whether a company like Summit Carbon Solutions qualifies for using eminent domain on such a project.

Whether or not Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds will sign the bill remains to be seen. The Des Moines Register reported on Tuesday that Reynolds was reviewing the legislation.

The bill has been in the making for several years and will require companies like Summit to work its way through a more complex regulatory process. It is aimed at forcing companies to work on exploring possible alternative pipeline routes and striking voluntary agreements with property owners.

The Iowa Renewable Fuels Association expressed disappointment and said the vote ""goes against farmers and ethanol producers"" who are looking for new markets for their corn and ethanol.

""IRFA is deeply disappointed by today's vote,"" IRFA Executive Director Monte Shaw, said in a statement.

""After enduring the largest two-year income drop in history, farmers are desperate to find new markets. CCS (carbon capture and storage) is the key to unlocking massive new demand for ethanol and corn around the world. For three years, IRFA has sought to work on a middle-ground approach that enhanced landowner rights and protections but would allow CCS projects a path forward. While a majority of the Iowa Senate turned their back on Iowa agriculture tonight, IRFA thanks those who stood for common sense.""

Summit Carbon Solutions did not respond to DTN's request for comment at press time.

EFFECTIVELY BANS

The IRFA said in the statement the bill effectively bans all CCS projects, even those that ""might achieve 100% voluntary easement, by putting permit restrictions in place making them not economically viable.""

Despite ""rhetoric"" from supporters of the bill, the IRFA said the measure ""fails to enhance"" property owner rights and ""targets"" only CCS projects.

All other privately owned projects including crude oil, wind and solar, would not be affected by the bill.

""For 25 years, Iowa has benefited greatly from being the most profitable place in the world to convert corn kernels into ethanol,"" Shaw said.

""Once the Tallgrass CCS pipeline in Nebraska begins operations later this year, that will no longer be the case. If this legislation goes into effect there will be very real, very severe economic consequences as others, like Nebraska, North Dakota and Brazil move forward with CCS. Iowa is poised to be left behind. Expansion plans will be shelved and we could see additional plant closures over time as the CCS-enabled plants elsewhere expand.""

EXPANDS BARRIERS

If the bill becomes law, it is expected to increase barriers to building carbon pipelines through a 25-year cap for operation, higher costs for insurance, more delays and opposition, and would deter investment.

The Iowa legislation will require pipeline companies to prove their projects are insured enough to cover losses and injury during construction.

Under the new definition of common carrier in Iowa, carbon pipeline companies are not allowed to use eminent domain to acquire property unless they can prove they are selling carbon dioxide as a commodity to someone not affiliated with their companies.

Among other things, the Iowa bill would limit the operating time of carbon pipelines to 25 years.

The IRFA said its members will be asking Reynolds to ""stand up for their future and the future of rural Iowa by vetoing this misguided legislation.""

The IRFA said it expects to see further economic decline in agriculture throughout 2025.

""CCS is the most cost-effective and impactful tool to unlock new markets that demand ultra-low carbon ethanol, such as heavy-duty engines, ocean-going vessels, rail and sustainable aviation fuel,"" the group said.

The global market for sustainable aviation fuel alone is expected to be about 100 billion gallons annually, IRFA said, potentially increasing corn grind by billions of bushels.

In November 2024, the Iowa Supreme Court sided with Summit Carbon Solutions in an appeal filed by a Hardin County landowner who fought the company from gaining access to his property to survey for the proposed project.

OTHER STATE BARRIERS

Outside of Iowa, Summit still faces challenges in South Dakota. The state's Public Utilities Commission in April voted 2-1 to again reject Summit's permit application. The state also rejected Summit's permit in 2023. South Dakota also passed a tougher eminent domain bill that was signed into law in March.

The Director General, Civil Aviation, Captain Chris Najomo has inaugurated six Technical Working Groups (TWGs) on accessing finance for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production in the country.

The TWGs will guide Nigeria’s SAF development across policy, feedstock, infrastructure, finance, sustainability, and technology.

The committee was inauguration at a high-level regional workshop on accessing finance for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production in Lagos.

The event, organized by the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) in collaboration with the National Council on Climate Change Secretariat (NCCCS) and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), brought together stakeholders from 14 African countries, international financial institutions, and SAF project developers

According to the spokesman, NCAA, Mr. Michael Achimugu, the workshop’s objectives included confronting the realities of SAF project development and financing, discussing de-risking strategies, and enhancing understanding of SAF direct supply lines and financial assessment tools.

The DGCA, Captain Najomo, emphasized the critical importance of access to finance for SAF production projects, while also highlighting its role in reducing the environmental impact of aviation and aligning with the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) Long-Term Aspirational Goal (LTAG) on net zero carbon emission by 2050.

Captain Najomo represented by the NCAA Regional Manager, Lagos, Barr. Bukola Teriba, noted that, the event marked a significant milestone in the region’s efforts to develop sustainable aviation fuels and reduce carbon emissions.

The aim of the workshop, he said, is to address investment challenges, risk mitigation, and project bankability on SAF, with a focus on Nigeria’s domestic roadmap.

Participants shared best practices in financial practices, identified key stakeholders in the finance space, and discussed available financial instruments in support of SAF development.

Limiting eligibility to feedstocks originating in North America for instance could continue recent strength in US soybean oil futures markets.","A proposal from House Republican tax-writers would extend for four additional years a new tax credit for low-carbon fuels and adjust the incentive to be more lenient to crops used for biofuels.

Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee on Monday introduced their draft portion of a far-reaching budget bill, which included various changes to Inflation Reduction Act clean energy subsidies. But the ""45Z"" Clean Fuel Production Credit, which requires fuels to meet an initial carbon intensity threshold and then ups the subsidy as emissions fall, would be the only incentive from the 2022 climate law to last even longer than Democrats planned under the current draft.

The proposal represents an early signal of Republicans' plans for major legislation through the Senate's reconciliation process, which allows budget-related bills to pass with a simple majority vote. The full Ways and Means Committee will consider amendments at a markup this afternoon, and House leaders want the full chamber to vote on the larger budget bill before the US Memorial Day holiday on 26 May. Afterwards, the proposal would head to the Republican-controlled Senate, where lawmakers could float further changes.

But the early draft, in a chamber with multiple deficit hawks and climate change skeptics that have pushed for a full repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act, is remarkable for not just keeping but expanding 45Z. The basics of the incentive — offering benefits to producers instead of blenders, throttling benefits based on carbon intensity, and offering more credit to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — would remain intact.

Various changes would help fuels derived from US crops. The most notable would prevent regulators measuring carbon intensity from considering ""indirect land use change"" emissions that attempt to quantify the risks of using agricultural land for fuel instead of food. Under current emissions modeling, the typical dry mill corn ethanol plant does not meet the 45Z credit's initial carbon intensity requirement — but substantially more gallons produced today would have a chance at qualifying without any new investments in carbon capture if this bill were to pass.

The indirect land use change would also create the possibility for canola-based fuels, which are just slightly too carbon-intensive to qualify for 45Z today, to start claiming some subsidy. Fuels from soybean oil currently qualify but would similarly benefit from larger potential credits.

Still, credit values would depend on final regulations and updated carbon accounting from President Donald Trump's administration. Since the House proposal does not address the current law's blunt system for rounding emissions values up and down, relatively higher-carbon corn and canola fuels still face the risk of falling just below 45Z's required carbon intensity threshold but then being rounded up to a level where they receive zero subsidy.

The House bill would also restrict eligibility to fuels derived from feedstocks sourced in the US, Canada, and Mexico — an attempt at a middle ground between refiners that have increasingly looked abroad for biofuel inputs and domestic farm groups that have lobbied for 45Z to prioritize US crops. That language would make more durable current restrictions on foreign used cooking oil and significantly reduce the incentive to import tallow from South America and Australia, a loss for major renewable diesel producers Diamond Green Diesel, Phillips 66, and Marathon Petroleum. The provision would also hurt US biofuel producer LanzaJet, which has imported lower-carbon Brazilian sugarcane ethanol as a SAF feedstock to the chagrin of domestic corn ethanol producers.

The bill would also require regulators to set more granular carbon intensity calculations for different types of animal manure biogas projects, all of which are treated the same under current rules. Other lifecycle emissions models treat some dairy projects at deeply negative carbon intensities.

Those changes to carbon intensity calculations and feedstock eligibility would kick in starting next year, meaning current rules would remain intact for now.

The proposal would however phase out the ability of clean energy companies without enough tax liability to claim the full value of Inflation Reduction Act subsidies to sell those tax credits to other businesses. That pathway, known as transferability, would end for clean fuel producers after 2027, hurting small biodiesel producers that operate under thin margins in the best of times as well as SAF startups that were planning to start producing fuel later this decade.

Markets unresponsive, but prepare for new possibilities

There was little immediate reaction across biofuel, feedstock, and renewable identification number (RIN) credit markets, since the bill could be modified and most of the changes would only take force in the future. But markets may shift down the road.

Limiting eligibility to feedstocks originating in North America for instance could continue recent strength in US soybean oil futures markets. July CBOT Soybean oil futures closed 3pc higher on Monday at 49.92¢/lb on the news and have traded even higher today. The spread between soybean oil and heating oil futures is then highly influential for the cost of D4 biomass-based diesel RIN credits, which are crucial for biofuel margins and have recently surged in value to their highest prices in over a year.

The more lenient carbon accounting will also help farmers eyeing a long-term future in renewable fuel markets and will support margins for ethanol and biodiesel producers reliant on crops. Corn and soy groups have pushed the government for less punitive emissions tracking, worried that crop demand could wane if refiners could only turn a profit by using lower-carbon waste feedstocks instead.

The House bill, if passed, would still run up against contradictory incentives from other governments, including SAF mandates in Europe that restrict fuels from crops and California's efforts to soon limit state low-carbon fuel standard credits for fuels derived from vegetable oils.",https://www.argusmedia.com/-/media/project/argusmedia/mainsite/images/14-generic-hero-banners/herobanner_1600x530_generic-c.jpg?h=530&iar=0&w=1600&rev=2cf023b4e0484c1bb091b9f72dbf7771&hash=72DBDFEBEF6EE62E751AB5DD2221C77E,N,,2025-05-13 14:57:24.842696

The funds will be earmarked for the delivery, fast food and renewable energy sectors.

The announcements were made on Monday (12) during the Brazil-China Business Seminar, closed by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (Workers’ Party), in Beijing, the Chinese capital.

Among those investing is Meituan, a leader in the Chinese delivery market. The company announced an investment of BRL 5.6 billion (more than US$ 987,7 million) over five years. It expects to generate 100,000 indirect jobs and compete with Brazilian delivery company iFood. In Brazil, the Chinese group will operate under the Keeta brand, already used in Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia.

Another company is Mixue, the world’s largest fast food chain, with 45,000 stores, surpassing McDonald’s. The group will import fruit from Brazil to produce ice cream and cold drinks. In total, the capital invested will be BRL 3.2 billion (over US$ 564,4 million).

Envision also announced investments of up to R$5 billion in an industrial park for the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green hydrogen.

In addition, BRL 6 billion (US$ 1,05 billion) was announced from Great Wall Motors (GWM), one of China’s largest automakers; BRL 3 billion (US$ 529,1 million) from the Chinese state-owned nuclear energy company CGN to build a renewable energy network in the state of Piauí; and BRL 2.4 billion (US$ 423,3 million) from the Baiyin Nonferrous mining group to buy a copper mine in the state of Alagoas.

After closing the meeting, Lula said that “in the last decade, China jumped from 14th to 5th place in the ranking of direct investment in Brazil. It is the main Asian investor in our country, with a stock of more than US$ 54 billion,” said the Brazilian president after the event.

“China has often been treated as if it were an enemy of world trade when, in fact, it is behaving like an example of a country that is trying to do business with nations that have been forgotten over the last 30 years by many others. We must remember that,” he continued.

President Lula also spoke about the need to export products with more added value. “There are people who complain that Brazil only exports agricultural products and iron ore to China, in other words, only commodities. I just would like to say to people who think like that that, for us to invest in more sophisticated products, with more technological development, we must bear in mind that for a long time, Brazil failed to invest in education. It’s important to remember that we won’t be able to be competitive in the technological world, in the digital world, if we don’t invest in education,” said Lula.

“We have to export agribusiness [products] and use this money to invest in education for us to be competitive with China in the production of electric cars, batteries, in AI developing. Nobody is going to give it to us for free. We have to seek the trust of partners so that they share with us their know-how. That’s what we’re doing with China,” concluded the president.

China, the second largest global economy, stands out as the main Asian investor in Brazil and the main destination for Brazilian exports. Impressively, 28% of the total value exported by Brazil goes to China, which is also responsible for 41.4% of the country’s trade surplus.

Commodities lead this trade relationship, with soybeans (33.4%), crude oil (21.2%) and iron ore (21.1%) accounting for 75.6% of everything Brazil sells to the Asian country. In 2024, Brazil cemented its position as the largest supplier of beef, poultry, soybeans, cellulose and sugar to the Chinese market.",https://assets.brasildefato.com.br/2025/05/bdf-20250512-125941-d09f9e.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 11:56:39.675140

Ampaire Inc. announced that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has approved the G-1 Issue Paper for its AMP-H570 hybrid electric propulsion system. This approval establishes the airworthiness and environmental standards required for FAA Supplemental Type Certification, marking a significant milestone toward commercial deployment of Ampaire's hybrid electric solutions.

The FAA's G-1 Issue Paper defines the regulatory framework that the AMP-H570 must satisfy to achieve Supplemental Type Certification (STC). With this approval, Ampaire advances to the next phase: working with the FAA to finalize the Means of Compliance and complete the testing campaign to validate the technology.

The AMP-H570's hybrid architecture – similar in principle to early automotive hybrids – enables in-flight recharging and does not require ground charging infrastructure. Combined with its retrofit-ready design, the system offers a plug-and-play solution for operators, reducing both deployment time and upfront costs while accelerating the path to lower-emission aviation.

The AMP-H570 delivers clear economic benefits for regional airlines and cargo operators, including lower fuel consumption, reduced maintenance costs, and extended aircraft service life. This positions Ampaire as a commercially scalable, cost-effective solution for cleaner aviation. The system also supports compliance with tightening global emissions regulations – enabling operators to reduce carbon footprint without sacrificing operational performance or profitability.

Ampaire's Eco Caravan, equipped with the AMP-H570, has already demonstrated more than double the fuel efficiency of conventional aircraft during flight tests. Recent ground tests successfully ran the system on 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), reinforcing Ampaire's leadership in practical, near-term solutions for sustainable aviation. The US Air Force has funded a research program to apply the AMP-H570 into the King Air, and other aircraft manufacturers have begun exploring both Integrated Parallel Hybrid and Series Hybrid applications of the AMP-H570 into new aircraft designs.

""The FAA's issuance of the G-1 Certification Basis for the AMP-H570 is a major step forward in commercializing hybrid electric propulsion,"" said Kevin Noertker, Cofounder and CEO of Ampaire. ""This milestone demonstrates that we are executing on our regulatory roadmap, removing risk for investors and customers, and accelerating real-world deployment.""

""Ampaire has worked for many years in close collaboration with our counterparts at the FAA,"" said Ed Lovelace, Chief Technology Officer. ""This productive dynamic has been instrumental in ensuring the highest safety standards while supporting the commercialization of our impactful, innovative solutions. The FAA's engagement has been essential to making hybrid electric propulsion a viable, scalable option for the aviation industry.""

Envision will develop Latin America’s first Net-Zero Industrial Park in Brazil, focusing on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), green hydrogen, and ammonia.

The initiative positions Brazil as a future global hub for green oil production, capitalizing on its biomass and renewable electricity.

The project replicates Envision’s proven Net-Zero model from Inner Mongolia and aligns with global decarbonization goals.

Envision, a global green tech leader, has partnered with the Brazilian government to accelerate the country’s green energy transition through the development of Latin America’s first Net-Zero Industrial Park.

The announcement came during Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s official visit to China, where he met with Envision Chairman Lei Zhang. The collaboration is part of a broader strategic effort to build sustainable industrial ecosystems and a complete green fuel value chain in Brazil.

Anchored by the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the industrial park will also drive the advancement of green hydrogen and green ammonia technologies. Envision will leverage its renewable energy systems and technology innovations to help Brazil scale its green oil capacity and establish global leadership in clean fuel production.

“Brazil is crucial to the global green transition of human society,” said Lei Zhang, Chairman of Envision. “It is poised to become the world’s most significant green oil production hub, with its abundant biomass and renewable electricity.”

Envision’s Net-Zero Industrial Park concept—first implemented in Inner Mongolia—has been recognized by the World Economic Forum’s World Transitioning Industrial Clusters Report. The site in Chifeng is currently home to the world’s largest and most cost-effective green hydrogen and ammonia facility.

“Envision is driving the advancement of cost competitiveness of green oil through technological innovation,” Zhang added. “Leveraging our pioneering Net-Zero Industrial Park model, we have built the world’s largest and most cost-effective green hydrogen and ammonia project.”

Building on successful rollouts in Inner Mongolia, Jiangsu, and Spain, Envision is now tailoring its model to Brazil’s unique resources and industrial strengths. The project is expected to position Brazil as a renewable energy innovation hub in Latin America and play a critical role in global decarbonization and energy security efforts.

“We are committed to putting the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind into action, leveraging China’s new energy innovations to bring a new global prosperity,” Zhang emphasized.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Envision-to-Build-Latin-Americas-First-Net-Zero-Industrial-Park-in-Brazil-to-Accelerate-Green-Fuel-Production.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 11:56:46.054089

Nebraska has a 75-cent-per-gallon income tax credit for SAF sold and used in the state, beginning Jan. 1, 2027.","Terry Wanzek sells corn to Dakota Spirit AgEnergy down the road from his farm near Jamestown in eastern North Dakota. And, since his farm is located near Interstate 94, his corn often heads to one of the western North Dakota ethanol producers, serving as a backhaul for truckers hauling sunflowers or beans to eastern buyers.

Wanzek also serves in the state legislature. So, when approached by the state’s ethanol association to sponsor legislation, he needed little convincing. “We grow a lot of corn and you can draw lines from our corn to the ethanol to the market that all comes back to us who raised the corn,” he says.

He was in the state senate over two decades ago when the state redirected its 1980s-era fuel tax credit that incentivized blending into a counter-cyclical program to aid the state’s producers during challenging market conditions with payments based on market costs of corn versus market value of ethanol.

“Back then, it did a couple things,” says Jeff Zueger, CEO of Harvestone Low Carbon Partners, owners of Dakota Spirit AgEnergy and Blue Flint Ethanol in western North Dakota. “It incentivized plants to get built in North Dakota, and made sure that, should you build a plant, there was a support mechanism around the commodity components.”

Though much smaller when compared to neighboring South Dakota and Iowa, North Dakota’s 550 million-gallon annual production still lands it in the top 10 ethanol producing states. Zueger points out that the North Dakota ethanol industry contributes nearly $1.7 billion annually to the state’s economy. While two of the original ethanol plants built in the 1980s closed (one in Grafton and one in Walhalla), six plants opened between 2007 and 2020. Five of them are operating today, and each has maxed out the counter-cyclical program’s caps of 10 years or $10 million per facility.

The North Dakota legislature is poised to redirect the continuing appropriation passed in 2003 to another program unique to North Dakota. “It’s about meeting the next phase for our industry,” Zueger says. “Commodity prices are relevant to our business, but sustainability relies on differentiating yourself and lowering the carbon intensity and energy inputs into your process so you can offer the product the market is asking for. The markets are asking for lower-carbon feedstock for SAF and lower-carbon products for the transportation industry.”

The legislation redirects the continuing appropriation consisting of 40% of the sums collected from farm vehicle registrations to a new low-carbon fuels fund. Eligible capital projects would include carbon capture and sequestration, energy efficiency upgrades and ethanol yield improvements. The low-carbon fuel incentives would be limited to 50% of the cost of a single project, with no more than $3 million per facility every biennium, capped at $10 million and 10 years for any one facility.

“This provides an additional support mechanism to cover some of the uncertainty in making these investments,” Zueger says. “Rulemaking in the regulatory front presents risk and the low-carbon fuel markets move around as well, so we’re making investments on two fronts with associated risks.”

The legislation has passed the state Senate and House, but was not yet signed by the governor at press time. Support was primarily positive, though Wanzek says some legislators want to get into discussions around climate change or the legitimacy of green initiatives. “I’m looking at it totally differently, from the business perspective. If there’s an opportunity to meet our customers’ needs, it could open up a whole lot more markets for ethanol and ultimately for corn farmers. We’re trying to assist the ethanol industry in North Dakota to address those market forces and help them position themselves to apply for those markets.”

North Dakota’s approach to positioning its ethanol production for future markets is unique in that it is directed at helping its producers bring lower carbon intensity (CI) products to emerging markets. Most states are adapting the 1980s-era tax credit approach aimed at lowering the cost of using the new, higher-priced sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to support in-state production and infrastructure.

States Targeting SAF

Illinois’ SAF incentive was first implemented in 2023. Washington State, Minnesota and Nebraska have also implemented SAF programs. New York and Michigan are currently considering measures. Chris Bliley, vice president of regulatory affairs for Growth Energy, also lists Arkansas, Hawaii and Alaska among states considering legislation. He expects other states with large aviation sectors, or those that have been on the cutting edge of carbon programs, to join the movement.

States vary in how they structure the incentive and their approaches to feedstocks.

Illinois’ $1.50-per-gallon tax credit started July 1, 2023, and covers SAF sold or used by an airline carrier in the state. To be eligible, SAF must achieve a 50% CI reduction when compared to petroleum-based jet fuel. Credits are not applicable to SAF from palm oil or soy-based SAF once air carriers have collectively purchased SAF made from 10 MMgy soybean oil feedstock. The credit can be claimed for fuel derived from biomass resources, waste streams, renewable energy sources or gaseous carbon oxides. Beginning June 1, 2028, feedstocks must be domestic biomass only.

Nebraska has a 75-cent-per-gallon income tax credit for SAF sold and used in the state, beginning Jan. 1, 2027. The credit applies to SAF reducing CI by at least 50%, with a supplementary credit of 1 cent for each percentage point better than 50%, capped at 50 cents. It excludes SAF derived from coprocessing and palm derivatives. This year, the legislature is considering removing a $500,000 annual limit.

Beginning July 1, 2024, Minnesota began offering a $1.50 tax credit for each gallon of SAF meeting a 50% CI reduction threshold, produced or blended in Minnesota, and used in aircraft departing from a Minnesota airport. The legislation excludes palm fatty acid distillates. Minnesota also offers a tax exemption for materials and supplies used in the construction or retrofitting of facilities located in the state to produce or blend SAF between June 2027 and July 2034.

The 2025 Minnesota legislature is considering increasing the incentive by 2 cents per gallon for each 1% CI reduction beyond 50%, capped at 50 cents per gallon (a max of $2). The credit would also be expanded to include liquid fuel derived from gaseous carbon oxides, increase the credit limits and allow unused credits to remain available for allocation through 2035.

Washington’s $1-per-gallon tax credit on SAF goes into effect once one or more facilities are operating with a production capacity of at least 20 MMgy, and expires nine years later. The credit applies to SAF achieving a 50% CI reduction compared to conventional jet, and increases by 2 cents for each additional 1% CI reduction, to a maximum of $2 per gallon. The credit applies to SAF produced or blended within the state of Washington for flights departing the state. Washington accepts SAF that has been coprocessed.

New York is considering one proposal for a $1.25-per-gallon producer tax credit that would increase to $1.50 per gallon for SAF made with domestically produced corn or soybeans. A second proposal under consideration by the legislature would peg the incentive at $1 per gallon, increasing by 2 cents for every 1% reduction below the 50% threshold, not to exceed $2 per gallon.

Michigan also has legislation to offer a $1-per-gallon tax credit for SAF that reduces life cycle emissions by at least 50% and is purchased in the state for departing flights. An additional 2-cent credit would be granted for each percent reduction greater than 50%, not to exceed $2.

Hawaii’s 2025 legislative session has two bills before it. One would mandate at least 10% SAF in intrastate airline flights by any commercial airline beginning in 2030 and increasing each year to 100% SAF in 2045. The bill calls for the state department of transportation to collaborate with other agencies and stakeholders to support the development of in-state SAF production, develop compliance procedures and incentives to promote SAF fuels, with an annual appropriation of $5 million. A second bill in Hawaii would establish a SAF credit on income taxes amounting to $1 per gallon sold for distribution in the state that meets a 50% reduction threshold in greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuel.

Arkansas legislators are considering an end user income tax credit equal to $1.09 per gallon of 100,000 gallons of SAF purchased, limited to 50% of the taxpayer’s income tax liability. For SAF producers, the bill offers an income tax credit equal to 30% of the cost of SAF production equipment up to $10 million for an investment over $2 billion and creating at least 75 new full-time permanent jobs. The bill also provides a sales-and-use tax exemption on utilities used in SAF production. The bill defines SAF as jet fuel derived from wood biomass.

In early April, Wisconsin lawmakers announced they were seeking co-sponsors for proposed legislation that would create a $1.50-per-gallon production tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel. To qualify for the credit, the SAF would need to be produced in Wisconsin and meet certain other conditions. This includes a requirement that at least 90% of the fuel be derived from synthetic, renewable and nonpetroleum sources, such as energy crops. In addition, the legislation requires eligible SAF feedstock to be produced in the U.S. If signed into law, the credit would take effect in 2028.

Support for New Fuel

The Biden administration’s SAF goals and the passage of SAF credits in the 2021 Inflation Reduction Act precipitated the state-level incentives, which mirror the 50% CI reduction threshold set in the IRA. Those incentives add to the SAF pathways already approved to generate renewable identification number (RIN) credits under the Renewable Fuel Standard.

“Because SAF is so new, it’s going to take a great deal of policy support,” Bliley says. “It’s important how all of these federal and state incentives stack up to help get a new fuel off the ground.” Asked whether the change in administrations will diminish SAF interest, Bliley responds: “These are important conversations happening not only here in the U.S., but there’s growing international appetite for SAF in places like Europe and Japan and other places. I think this continues. And I know a number of airlines continue to be heavily engaged, especially with the implementation of [the tax credits in the IRA under] 45Z.”

Details of the 45Z regulations and, indeed, the fate of the entire program itself, are in the hands of the Trump administration. The name itself is in flux, with the administration declaring the term “sustainable” will be replaced with the word “synthetic,” even though the fuels industry historically used the term for fuels made from coal or natural gas rather than petroleum.

“We don’t see a real change,” Bliley says. “It doesn’t change the way we view the market or the potential for ethanol for our producers.”

The potential for ethanol to contribute to carbon reduction is significant, Bliley says, citing the study, “A Strategic Roadmap for Decarbonizing the U.S. Ethanol Industry.” Released in September, the study was conducted by the Energy Futures Initiative Foundation, led by former DOE Secretary Ernest Moniz, lending credibility to the findings, Bliley says. “It emphasizes what we know already—ethanol’s ability to decarbonize. Just yield improvement can decarbonize ethanol by 6%, but we have the ability to drop carbon intensity by as much as 160%.”

EgyptAir and AerCap have announced a deepened strategic partnership to advance EgyptAir’s fleet modernization and expansion. The collaboration, solidified during a high-level meeting in Cairo on May 8, signals a robust commitment to innovation, sustainability, and global competitiveness in a rapidly evolving aviation landscape.

The meeting brought together AerCap CEO Aengus Kelly and Captain Ahmed Adel, Chairman of EgyptAir Holding Company, to explore new avenues for cooperation. With AerCap already financing 28 aircraft in EgyptAir’s fleet—comprising of Boeing 777-300ERs, Airbus A320/321neos, and Boeing 787-9s—the partnership is a cornerstone of EgyptAir’s operational strategy. Nearly 40% of EgyptAir’s fleet operates under leasing agreements with AerCap, underscoring the lessor’s critical role in the airline’s growth.

“This partnership enables us to integrate cutting-edge aircraft, supporting our goals of operational efficiency, environmental sustainability, and an elevated customer experience,” Captain Adel said. The discussions focused on aligning EgyptAir’s fleet with global aviation trends, particularly the rising demand for fuel-efficient aircraft amid ongoing supply chain challenges and delivery delays from manufacturers.

AerCap, which reported 112 lease agreements and 49 asset purchases in Q1 2025 alone, says it is well-positioned to support EgyptAir’s ambitions. “EgyptAir is a key partner in Africa and the Middle East, and we are proud to support their ambitious growth strategy,” Kelly stated. “Our collaboration reflects a shared commitment to innovation and sustainability, ensuring EgyptAir remains a leader in global aviation.”

A core focus of the partnership is sustainability, with both companies prioritizing modern, fuel-efficient aircraft to reduce carbon emissions and fuel consumption. This aligns with EgyptAir’s broader strategy to expand its network while meeting growing travel demand across Africa, the Middle East, and beyond.

EgyptAir’s fleet includes a long-haul portfolio of four A330-200s, four A330-300s, five 777-300ERs, eight 787 Dreamliners, and three A330 Freighters, with ten Airbus A350-900s on order to further modernize its operations. The carrier recently bolstered its long-haul capabilities with a 17-year-old Airbus A330-200 (MSN 874), which arrived in Cairo on April 25, 2025, after storage and prior operation with Hi Fly Malta and GullivAir.

Under its new guidance, Air New Zealand said that it expects to reduce its “well-to-wake” net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 20% to 25% per cent by 2030, on a 2019 net emissions basis.

Under its new guidance, Air New Zealand said that it expects to reduce its “well-to-wake” net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 20% to 25% per cent by 2030, on a 2019 net emissions basis. Well-to-wake emissions encompass emissions from the jet fuel the airline uses, covering the entire life cycle emissions of the jet fuel. Inn 2024, Air New Zealand said that well to wake emissions counted for 92% of its GHG footprint.

The airline’s prior SBTi-approved target, initially set in 2022, aimed for a 28.9% reduction in carbon intensity by 2030, from a 2019 baseline, of the associated with the well to wake emissions. Key focus areas targeted by the company to reach its climate goals included increasing the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), fleet renewal, the adoption of zero emissions aircraft technologies, implementing operational carbon efficiencies, and utilizing carbon removals.

In July 2024, however, the company announced that it was retiring its 2030 goal, as many of the levers needed to reach its target had not sufficiently advanced, including the availability of new aircraft for its fleet renewal initiatives, and the affordability and availability of SAF, as well as regulatory and policy support.

Scaling the use of sustainable aviation fuel remains a key lever in achieving the new guidance, with Air New Zealand saying that the guidance relies on meeting a target of 10% SAF as a percentage of total fuel in 2030. The airline only used 0.4% SAF last year, but said that it anticipates increasing this significantly to 1.6% this year.

Air New Zealand has retained its 2050 net zero carbon emissions target, and the company said that it plans to update its “Transition Plan to 2050” later this year.

In a post announcing the new guidance, Air New Zealand Chief Sustainability and Corporate Affairs Officer Kiri Hannifin said:

“I am sure there will be higher levels of ambition, and I acknowledge there will be many people who will argue we should be doing more. For us, we want to be very honest about what we think is possible given the challenges involved in decarbonising the aviation sector. Setting something we can’t reach wouldn’t be tika.

The Dutch Emissions Authority (NEa) releases data five times a year, in January, March, April, May, July and October.","The premium for used cooking oil methyl ester (UCOME) over gasoil reached two-month lows this week, as sources pointed to low physical demand and downward pressure from an excess of biofuel compliance tickets in the Netherlands’ HBE renewable energy system specifically tied to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production and trade, which road blenders can buy to meet their mandate targets.

Fastmarkets latest price assessments

Fastmarkets’ assessment for biodiesel, UCOME premium, fob ARA was $788.75 per tonne on Thursday May 8, up from a two-month low of $785 per tonne on Wednesday May 7. The price had remained above $800 per tonne since March 13.

Fastmarkets assessed oil, ultra low sulfur diesel, fob ARA at $594.75 per tonne on Thursday, up from $583.75 per tonne day on day and from $590.75 per tonne week on week.

Road demand in the Netherlands for physical biofuels in recent months has mostly been focused on biofuels made from feedstocks outlined in Annex 9 part A of the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED III), so-called 9A or advanced feedstocks able to generate advanced HBE tickets (HBE-G) such as advanced FAME and, especially, POME (palm oil mill effluent) based HVO.

Both SAF and UCOME can generate tickets under the Netherlands’ compliance system, as both are eligible under RED III’s Annex 9 part B or the Netherlands’ HBE IXB because they are produced using used cooking oil (UCO). SAF can also be produced using other wastes and advanced feedstocks, but most production and supply is limited to UCO-based product at present.

SAF trade and production

Trade and production of SAF at the beginning of the EU SAF mandate had also generated more tickets under the HBE system, with the Netherlands’ program including the maritime and aviation sectors alongside road transport.

As a result, buyers that need physical UCOME, or even category 1 and 2 tallow-based biodiesel, for the road are now incentivized to buy HBE IXB tickets, rather than physically blend fuels. This has further weighed on demand and prices for UCOME.

“KLM flooded the Dutch market with SAF tickets, so tickets were much cheaper than blending,” a source told Fastmarkets.

The Dutch Emissions Authority (NEa) releases data five times a year, in January, March, April, May, July and October.

According to the latest preliminary data released by the NEa in April, the number of HBE tickets registered under the Dutch biofuel compliance program for 2024 associated with SAF blending accounted for 11.5% of all HBEs registered, up from 9.2% in March and from 8% a year earlier.

SAF has claimed a total of 12.3 million HBEs so far for compliance year 2024 out of a total of 105.7 million registered HBEs, the data confirmed.

Comparatively, under the UK’s Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation, while UCOME can generate waste-based tickets or Renewable Trade Fuel Certificates (RTFCs), only road transport can currently take part in the program, with a separate process mapped out for the budding SAF sector.

In November, the UK SAF mandate was signed into law, requiring a 2% share of SAF be blended into jet fuel in 2025, 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.",https://www.fastmarkets.com/uploads/91/c7/9723a7604615afb197745ec58d70/biodiesel-plant-1024x631.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 07:56:57.591555

PTT Oil and Retail Business Plc (OR), the oil distribution arm of PTT, has announced a plan to supply locally-made SAF to an airline operator, while Bangchak expects to start commercial production of the biofuel for aircraft in the middle of this year.

These moves align with the European Union requiring airlines flying to Europe to mix 3% SAF with jet fuel. The proportion is set to increase to 15-50% by 2050.

SAF produces up to 80% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fuel, according to media reports citing various forecasts.

OR and Bangkok Airways recently signed a letter of intent to procure and utilise SAF, marking the first initiative of this kind in Thailand.

""This partnership represents a major step in propelling Thailand's aviation industry towards a greener, more environmentally responsible future,"" said Chaipruet Watchareecupt, OR's vice-president for aviation and marine marketing.

OR will apply its expertise in distributing aviation fuel to supply SAF to Bangkok Airways' flight operations.

SAF is being produced by another PTT subsidiary, PTT Global Chemical (GC), which uses used cooking oil as a raw material.

GC's SAF production is estimated at 6 million litres a year in the first phase.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand is preparing to announce the enforcement of SAF usage at 1%, scheduled to take effect in 2026. The amount will gradually increase to 3-5% in the future.

Bangchak, which also sees the increasing trend in SAF demand, is pushing ahead with SAF production near its oil refinery in Bangkok's Phra Khanong area.

The construction of its 8.5-billion-baht SAF factory has reached 96% completion as of April.

Bangchak plans to first make SAF, amounting to half of its full capacity of 1 million litres a day. The capacity of 1 million litres is calculated from an estimate that Thailand will use 5% SAF mixed with conventional oil, based on actual jet fuel supply of 20 million litres a day in 2019.

Let’s keep working together to secure more projects just like Woodchuck in Michigan so we can lead the future and grow our economy.”

At full capacity, the facility will divert tens of thousands of tons of wood waste from landfills each year—converting it into renewable biomass to power local industries, support utility decarbonization, and reduce methane emissions from decomposing wood. By using AI to sort, identify, and process usable materials, Woodchuck drastically increases efficiency and transparency in a sector long plagued by fragmentation and contamination challenges.

“Construction and demolition sites produce an enormous amount of recoverable wood, yet the majority of it still ends up in landfills,” said Todd Thomas, CEO of Woodchuck. “This facility changes that. Woodchuck transforms waste into value, reducing costs, reducing landfill usage, and unleashing an abundant energy future!”

In addition to servicing the construction industry, Woodchuck’s capabilities are already proving critical in emergency response and environmental recovery. Following the devastating ice storms that swept through northern Michigan earlier this month, Woodchuck has partnered with several counties to rapidly process fallen trees and wood debris—turning what would have been landfill waste or burn piles into clean biomass energy. The effort is helping communities recover faster, while reinforcing the value of localized circular economy solutions in the face of climate-driven weather events.

In addition to elected officials, the grand opening was attended by leaders from the energy, manufacturing, and sustainability sectors, highlighting growing national interest in waste-to-energy solutions that close the loop between construction, recycling, and clean power.

Public Support – Polls show most Americans support growing EV infrastructure as a step toward fighting climate change.
Taking the Fight to Court The Trump administration defends the freeze on federal EV charging funding.
It will also help them check how well the funding meets U.S. energy and economic goals.","Momentum for electric vehicles (EVs) is growing fast, but a major hurdle has appeared. Seventeen U.S. states, with California in the lead, sued the Trump administration. They want to restore $5 billion in federal funds meant for EV charging infrastructure.

Congress originally approved these funds. They are key to growing charging networks across the country and helping promote sustainable transportation.

States like New York, Illinois, and Minnesota are part of the lawsuit. They say freezing the funds slows down economic growth and harms renewable energy efforts. They believe the freeze blocks progress toward meeting important climate goals.

California Governor Gavin Newsom remarked that such a decision is illegal and can hurt thousands of jobs. Meanwhile, California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said:

“The President continues to roll back environmental and climate change protections, this time illegally stripping away billions of dollars for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, all to line the pockets of his Big Oil friends.”

The coalition views this funding as crucial. It helps keep the U.S. a leader in clean energy and ensures a sustainable transportation future.

Frozen Funds, Frozen Progress: Why the Lawsuit Matters

The lawsuit claims that halting access to the $5 billion fund creates serious problems for EV growth. Without a reliable network of chargers, many people might hesitate to switch from gas-powered cars to electric models.

Key points raised by the states include:

Economic Impact – Losing these funds could cost thousands of jobs in industries tied to building and maintaining EV infrastructure.

Climate Goals – Without a solid charging network, states may not meet their carbon reduction goals.

Public Support – Polls show most Americans support growing EV infrastructure as a step toward fighting climate change.

The states say that cutting this funding harms the environment. It also hurts local economies and makes it harder for everyone to access EVs.

Blocking these resources could slow down an EV market that experts expect to boom in the next few years. Analysts project that EVs could make up more than 60% of U.S. auto sales by 2030 if the right infrastructure is in place.

According to the International Energy Agency’s outlook, over a third of automobiles sold globally by 2030 could be EVs.

Taking the Fight to Court

The Trump administration defends the freeze on federal EV charging funding. They say the program is under review. This review aims to ensure it matches the administration’s priorities. These priorities focus on supporting fossil fuel development instead of expanding clean energy initiatives.

President Trump has expressed opposition to federal support for electric vehicles. He promised to roll back EV mandates. He will revoke pollution limits that help zero-emission vehicle sales and plans to eliminate federal EV tax credits.

The administration’s energy policy aims to declare a “national energy emergency.” This will boost domestic oil drilling and cut federal investment in EV infrastructure.

Some administration officials also say there’s a need to pause the program. They believe this will stop foreign competitors, like China, from gaining benefits. It will also help them check how well the funding meets U.S. energy and economic goals.

However, the states argue that this claim is misleading. They say that investing in local EV infrastructure boosts American industries, creates jobs, and strengthens energy independence.

Winning the lawsuit could do more than release the $5 billion. It could set a strong legal example for other renewable energy projects facing political challenges. Future green initiatives might be able to use this case to defend against funding cuts or delays.

At a time when global EV sales rose by 35% in 2023, reaching over 14 million units, according to the IEA, the pressure to keep moving forward is strong. The lawsuit is not just about chargers; it’s about protecting America’s role in a fast-growing, clean-energy future.

EV Market Poised for Growth—But Funding is Key

The electric vehicle market is already shifting rapidly. More drivers want EVs. They like the lower costs, care about the environment, and appreciate government incentives. However, building enough charging stations remains one of the biggest challenges.

In 2024, the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) market achieved a record high, with 1.3 million EVs sold, marking a 7.3% increase from the previous year. EVs accounted for about 8.1% of all new vehicle sales.

Notably, while Tesla’s sales declined by 5.6%, other automakers like General Motors and Honda experienced significant growth, introducing new models such as the Honda Prologue, which sold over 33,000 units in its debut year.

In April 2025, EV sales dropped by 5%. This decline came from high vehicle prices, fewer incentives, and worries about charging infrastructure.

On the infrastructure front, the U.S. expanded its EV charging network to nearly 204,000 Level 2 and DC fast charging ports by the end of 2024, doubling the number since 2020. This expansion has improved coverage along major corridors, with 59.1% now having DC fast chargers at least every 50 miles, up from 38% in 2020.

Currently, SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) and renewable technologies are growing. However, EVs still need thousands of new public chargers to meet rising demand. Without the $5 billion in federal funding, many of these projects could be delayed or canceled.

Here are the major stakes involved in this legal fight:

Access and Equality. Without widespread charger coverage, rural and underserved communities could be left behind.

Speed of Adoption: The more chargers are available, the faster people will feel comfortable buying EVs.

State Leadership. California and other states want to ban new gas-powered vehicle sales by 2035. However, they need the right infrastructure to make this transition work.

What’s Next for EV Infrastructure and Clean Energy Goals?

This lawsuit reveals a larger issue: the clash between state climate efforts and federal policy changes. With governments and companies pushing to cut carbon emissions, strong legal protections for green projects are more crucial than ever.

The legal outcome could change EV infrastructure in the U.S. If the states win, it may lead to more investments in EV chargers and other renewable energy tech. This boost could help the green economy and create thousands of jobs.

If the lawsuit fails, it might delay EV adoption. This is especially true in states that depend on federal support for infrastructure projects. Analysts say that if infrastructure development doesn’t keep up, hitting net-zero emissions by mid-century will be much tougher.

In the coming months, as the case moves through the courts, the outcome may decide if America can keep up with global leaders in clean transportation. This legal battle will greatly impact the future of clean mobility, economic opportunity, and environmental leadership.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/States-Sue-Trump-Over-5-Billion-EV-Charger-Funding-1024x683.png,N,,2025-05-12 18:56:48.630230

This is the Group’s second purchase of neat SAF from the Singapore refinery, helping to develop the country’s SAF ecosystem and enhance supply chain resilience.
SIA also participates in the Green Fuel Forward campaign, an initiative designed to boost the demand for SAF in the Asia-Pacific region.
Lee Wen Fen, Chief Sustainability Officer, Singapore Airlines, said: “These agreements represent important steps in the SIA Group’s broader strategy to scale up its use of sustainable aviation fuel.
The SIA Group will continue to work with partners around the world to test and implement solutions that support the airline industry’s long-term decarbonisation goals.","The Singapore Airlines (SIA) Group has signed agreements with Neste and World Energy to acquire Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and SAF certificates respectively, supporting its decarbonisation journey while gaining further valuable insights into the pathways, standards, and certification systems in the renewable fuel landscape.

The first transaction saw the Group acquire 1,000 tonnes of Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA)-eligible neat SAF, sourced from renewable fuel producer Neste. The SAF was produced at Neste’s Singapore refinery, blended locally and uplifted at Singapore Changi Airport. This is the Group’s second purchase of neat SAF from the Singapore refinery, helping to develop the country’s SAF ecosystem and enhance supply chain resilience.

In addition, the Group purchased approximately 2,000 tonnes of CORSIA-eligible SAF in the form of emissions reductions from World Energy, a United States-based producer, utilising the Book & Claim Chain of Custody model. This allows the Group to claim associated emissions reductions without physical fuel delivery. Both deals were completed in the first quarter of 2025 and these transactions are projected to reduce more than 9,500 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.

SIA also participates in the Green Fuel Forward campaign, an initiative designed to boost the demand for SAF in the Asia-Pacific region. Launched by the World Economic Forum and Singapore’s GenZero, the campaign seeks to enhance awareness and understanding of SAF, while actively promoting its use and fostering strategic partnerships between regional corporations and airlines.

Lee Wen Fen, Chief Sustainability Officer, Singapore Airlines, said: “These agreements represent important steps in the SIA Group’s broader strategy to scale up its use of sustainable aviation fuel. By working with different suppliers and exploring diverse sourcing models and certification pathways, we gain crucial insights into the SAF landscape and we can better understand the pathways towards a more sustainable aviation ecosystem. The SIA Group will continue to work with partners around the world to test and implement solutions that support the airline industry’s long-term decarbonisation goals. This will allow us to validate SAF demand, enhance our technical expertise in this area, and strengthen our ability to meet our medium-term commitment of 5% SAF use by 2030 and long-term goal net zero carbon emissions by 2050.”

The Singapore Airlines Group has developed a comprehensive strategy to support its medium-term commitment of using 5% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2030 and its long-term ambition of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. It utilises a test-and-learn approach, as the Group partners with stakeholders throughout the value chain to learn about differences in various SAF procurement methods.

Key elements of the strategy include expanding SAF supply through partnerships, driving industry growth with targeted SAF purchases, and advocating for supportive policies. SIA is also focused on raising SAF awareness within the aviation and corporate sectors, while collaborating with industry partners to develop standardised SAF accounting and reporting principles like the Book & Claim system. This approach reflects SIA’s commitment to a sustainable and carbon-neutral aviation future.",https://asianaviation.com/wp-content/uploads/854af4fe91c324cc_org-1024x684.png,N,,2025-05-12 18:56:56.945928

Made through its United Airlines Ventures Sustainable Flight Fund, the total investment is expected to support Twelve’s plans to develop its first commercial-scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production facility in the United States.

Once operational, the Moses Lake plant is expected to produce up to 50,000 gallons of SAF per year. This will be achieved by combining captured CO2 with hydrogen to create synthetic hydrocarbons, which will be refined into jet fuel.

Additionally, Twelve has also secured a 14-year agreement to supply 260 million gallons of SAF to the International Airlines Group (IAG), which includes airlines such as British Airways and Iberia.

“Scaling the SAF industry is the major hurdle air travel needs to clear to increase the supply and reduce the price of lower carbon fuels,” noted Andrew Chang, Head of United Airlines Ventures.

The startup will be part of United Airlines’ broader strategy to achieve Net-Zero emissions by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets.

Twelve CEO Nicholas Flanders stated that the company’s alternative SAF fuel will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90% compared to conventional jet fuel.

The event, organised by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) in collaboration with the National Council on Climate Change Secretariat (NCCCS) and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), under the Assistance, Capacity Building, and Training for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (ACT-SAF) Africa–India Project.

The five-day hybrid workshop, themed “Access to Finance for SAF Production,” brought together participants from 14 African countries, international financial institutions and SAF project developers. The aim was to explore investment opportunities, address financial challenges and promote risk mitigation and project bankability for SAF development across the continent.

The Nigeria-specific segment took place during the final two days and focused on the country’s domestic roadmap for SAF production.

A major highlight of the workshop was the formal inauguration of six technical working groups (TWGs) by NCAA director-general, Capt. Chris Najomo. Represented by the Lagos regional manager, Bukola Teriba, Najomo emphasised Nigeria’s commitment to advancing sustainable aviation.

The newly inaugurated TWGs will focus on policy and regulation, feedstock and production, funding and investment, technology and innovation, environmental and social impact, as well as infrastructure and logistics.

These working groups are expected to provide strategic guidance on SAF development in Nigeria, laying the foundation for policy, innovation, sustainability and infrastructure growth.

The ACT-SAF workshop also tackled the realities faced by SAF developers and financiers and promoted discussions around de-risking strategies. It underscored the importance of collaboration among stakeholders to achieve viable SAF production across Africa.

Other key objectives included improving understanding of SAF supply chains and financial assessment tools, sharing best practices in financing, mapping key financial stakeholders and identifying available funding instruments to support SAF development.

In her remarks, Teriba reiterated the importance of access to finance in achieving SAF production goals. She noted that investing in SAF aligns with the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO) long-term aspirational goal (LTAG) of achieving net-zero carbon emissions in aviation by 2050.

Tariffs between the U.S. and China to be dramatically reduced as negotiations continue

As trade tensions and uncertainty continue to drastically impact markets, officials from the United States and China met in Geneva this weekend to discuss tariffs. With current tariffs set at 145% for all Chinese imported goods in the U.S. and 125% tariffs for all exported U.S. goods to China, both economies have felt the effects of these immense import-export fees. Although the discussion is not over, both countries have agreed to reduce these tariffs for 90 days, reducing the 145% U.S. tariff to 30% and the 125% Chinese tariff to 10%. Negotiations will continue as both countries hope to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. In an increasingly uncertain world, ESG solutions are crucial for keeping your company on track.

Norwegian wealth fund divests from Israel’s Paz Oil Company as a result of war in Gaza

The world’s largest wealth fund in Norway sold all of its shares in the Israeli oil company, Paz. This is a direct result of the company’s activities of supplying fuel to Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The Council on Ethics is enforcing higher standards on businesses, especially those operating in occupied Palestine. In its divestment recommendation, the Council stated, “By operating infrastructure for the supply of fuel to the Israeli settlements on the West Bank, Paz is contributing to their perpetuation.” This recommendation is the second of its kind, as the Council also recommended a divestment from Bezeq, an Israeli telecommunications company, in December.

Twelve aims to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using carbon dioxide and water. They call the process “industrial photosynthesis,” using electrolyzers to create synthesis gas. The airline has also partnered with Heirloom, a startup focused on carbon capture directly from the air, and JetZero, a startup developing a blended wing body aircraft. With a $200 million Sustainable Flight Fund backed by Google, Boeing, and about 20 other companies and airlines, United is committed to a 2035 target of 50% fewer emissions. Companies trying to reach net-zero targets, like United, can find help through utilizing ESG tools.

Airlines are shifting their approach to a low-carbon future, seeking not only to offset the emissions they generate, but remove them altogether and then use the CO2 to make sustainable aviation fuel.

For United Airlines, this means teaming up with startups that are working to pull carbon dioxide out of the air, mimic photosynthesis to produce jet fuel and revolutionize aircraft design to slash emissions.

Earlier this year, the Chicago-based carrier joined forces with Heirloom, a company specializing in direct air capture of carbon dioxide, in a partnership that not only sees the companies sequester CO2 but also — potentially — use it to make sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. In another deal announced Tuesday, United said it was working with Twelve, a startup that uses industrial photosynthesis to produce SAF from CO2 and water.

Last month, United said it was investing in next-generation blended-wing startup JetZero in a deal that could see the airline buy up to 200 of the wide-bodied aircraft, which according to United, have the potential to reduce fuel burn by up to 50% per passenger mile compared with traditional planes.

Lauren Riley, the airline’s chief sustainability officer, sets the company’s decarbonization strategy. Her mandate includes reaching an interim sustainability target by 2035: a 50% reduction in carbon intensity compared with 2019, as verified by the Science Based Targets initiative.

At the center of the airline’s strategy is United Airlines Ventures’ Sustainable Flight Fund, a \$200 million investment vehicle backed by the carrier and 22 partners, including Air Canada, Air New Zealand, Boeing and Google.

Andrew Chang, head of corporate development at United, is the managing director of UAV and oversees its investments.

Carbon Removal Using Crushed Up Rocks

Startup Heirloom Carbon uses low-cost limestone to absorb carbon from the air.

Crushed up limestone is heated in a kiln.

That heat separates the limestone into carbon dioxide and calcium oxide powder. The carbon dioxide can then be stored permanently underground or in concrete.

The calcium oxide powder is mixed with water to form calcium hydroxide, which is spread out on large trays that are stacked vertically.

The calcium hydroxide absorbs carbon dioxide from the air. After about three days, it becomes limestone and the process is repeated.

Limestone naturally absorbs carbon. Heirloom accelerates the natural process so it takes days instead of years. To remove carbon from the air, the company warms up crushed limestone in a kiln heated to about 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit and powered by renewable electricity. That heat separates the carbon dioxide, which is stored underground or in concrete, and leaves a chemical powder called calcium oxide.

That powder is then combined with water to become calcium hydroxide and spread onto trays the size of picnic blankets. Outside, the calcium hydroxide puffs up like a cookie in the oven as it absorbs carbon dioxide over about three days. The resulting limestone can go back into the kiln to restart the cycle.

But what makes United’s deal with Heirloom unusual is its versatility: The captured CO2 can either be permanently sequestered—generating carbon-dioxide removal, or CDR, credits—or used in the production of power-to-liquid SAF.

United’s Sustainable Flight Fund has the option to buy 500,000 tons of CO2 from Heirloom. It said capturing that amount of CO2 from the air and sequestering it permanently underground is the equivalent to abating CO2 emissions from a 737 MAX flying about 33 million miles.

The airline acknowledged that SAF, like regular jet fuel, emits CO2 into the atmosphere when burned. But it pointed out the CO2 used to make SAF primarily comes from the atmosphere, whereas the CO2 used to make jet fuel comes from oil that was underground. The advantage of burning SAF is that it results in no net change to atmospheric CO2, the company says.

However, United added capturing and sequestering CO2 using Heirloom’s technology while continuing to use regular jet fuel is currently cheaper than using CO2 to make sustainable aviation fuel. That is because making SAF also requires making hydrogen and combining it with the captured CO2, which is expensive.

Riley said that the type of carbon removal Heirloom offers is preferable to traditional nature-based offsets, which she said lack permanence and are harder to measure.

Chang didn’t disclose exactly how much UAV invested in the three deals, saying only when it comes to investments, “our sweet spot is \$5 million to \$10 million, maybe sometimes up to \$15 million.”

How Twelve makes sustainable aviation fuel

In Twelve’s carbon dioxide electrolyzer, carbon dioxide flows in and comes into contact with a metal catalyst. One of the oxygen atoms in CO2 gets separated, leaving carbon monoxide (CO).

Water flows into a water electrolyzer and comes into contact with a metal catalyst, splitting into hydrogen and oxygen.

Carbon monoxide and hydrogen are combined to make synthesis gas, while oxygen is vented or captured and used in other industrial processes.

While the Heirloom deal is key to lowering emissions in the short term, United’s real decarbonization challenge lies in its long-term fuel strategy. In 2024, United sourced 14 million gallons of SAF—some 0.3% of its total fuel usage for the year. Yet, with SAF costing three to four times more than conventional jet fuel, increasing that share represents a challenge.

“Scaling the SAF industry is the major hurdle air travel needs to clear in order to increase the supply and reduce the price of lower carbon fuels,” said Chang.

United’s deal with Twelve goes some way to address that. It follows an \$83 million funding round secured by the startup for its first production facility in Moses Lake, Wash. The plant is expected to begin production this year and plans to produce 50,000 gallons of SAF annually, with the potential to reduce life cycle emissions by up to 90% compared with conventional jet fuel, according to United.

Riley and her team helped shape the SAF provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, including the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit, which provides a credit of 35 cents a gallon for sustainable aviation fuel. Today, following the election of President Trump, questions continue to hang over the future of the IRA, and the path ahead for the aviation industry appears turbulent.

Yet Riley remains bullish. She points to the SAF Coalition, a 60-member nonprofit advocacy group established last year including oil majors, startups, labor unions and agriculture stakeholders that she says are all pushing for the continuation of 45Z.

“What’s really interesting in the U.S. is that the states that are benefiting from new SAF production facilities coming online are largely in red states. It is largely in the geographies that you wouldn’t expect would be behind any kind of climate ambition. This is good for the economy. This is creating jobs in a transitioning industry,” she said.",https://decarbonfuse.com/assets/favi/favicon-32x32-b1c94ae87840c662751403aefa5b6ea92417e97aab4cbce5a1b99c4e112cac36.png,N,,2025-05-12 16:56:37.053325

The Director General of NCAA, Capt. Chris Najomo, inaugurated six Technical Working Groups (TWGs) that will guide Nigeria’s SAF development across policy, feedstock, infrastructure, finance, sustainability, and technology.

The TWGs will play a crucial role in shaping Nigeria’s SAF roadmap, and the workshop provided a platform for stakeholders to discuss various de-risking strategies and the role of all actors in achieving viable SAF production in Africa.

Additionally, the workshop enhanced understanding of SAF Direct Supply Line and its financial assessment tools, shared best practices in financial strategies, and identified key stakeholders within the finance sector.

The event was attended by representatives from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC), EU delegations to Nigeria and WACAF, other international organisations, industry stakeholders, and partners.

The workshop was coordinated by the Directorate of Air Transport Regulations of the NCAA.

According to Capt. Chris Najomo, access to finance for SAF production projects is critical to reducing the environmental impact of aviation, aligning with ICAO’s Long-Term Aspirational Goal (LTAG) of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Najomo stated that the workshop marked a significant step towards achieving this goal and that Nigeria’s commitment to developing SAF is expected to have a positive impact on the environment and the aviation industry.

The development of SAF is a crucial step towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions from aviation, and Nigeria’s efforts in this area are expected to contribute to the global goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.

With the Technical Working Groups in place, Nigeria is poised to take a leading role in the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuels in Africa.",https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/screenshot_20230620-155722_1.jpg,N,,2025-05-12 14:56:41.446059

This move is part of United’s Sustainable Flight Fund, and it supports the airline’s goal of cutting aviation emissions by 90% by 2050. The fund is designed to back new ideas that can make air travel cleaner.

Turning CO2 into Jet Fuel: How Twelve’s Tech Works

Twelve has built a new way to make jet fuel that doesn’t rely on crops, waste oils, or fossil fuels. Their patented process takes carbon dioxide (CO2) captured from the air or factories and mixes it with renewable electricity (like solar or wind power). The result is a liquid fuel that works like regular jet fuel but with much lower emissions.

This carbon transformation method creates a closed-loop carbon cycle. That means the CO2 used to make the fuel is the same CO2 released when planes burn it — no extra carbon is added to the atmosphere. By closing this loop, Twelve’s process helps slow climate change and reduces the need to pump new fossil fuels from the ground.

It also fixes another problem. Many traditional types of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) use materials like used cooking oil, animal fats, or crops such as corn and sugarcane. These feedstocks are limited and can be hard to get in large amounts. They also raise ethical questions about using farmland for fuel instead of food.

Twelve’s technology skips these issues entirely, making it easier to grow the SAF supply in the long run.

United’s investment comes after Twelve raised $83 million in its recent Series C funding round. The company is also building its first commercial facility, called AirPlant™ One, in Moses Lake, Washington. The plant will start operating this year and will produce 50,000 gallons of sustainable aviation fuel each year.

Backing the Future: United’s Sustainable Flight Fund

United Airlines is serious about finding new ways to make flying greener. The airline launched the Sustainable Flight Fund in 2023, raising over $200 million so far. Partners in the fund include Air Canada, Boeing, JPMorgan Chase, and other major companies.

The goal of the fund is to help new SAF projects grow faster. By putting money into companies like Twelve, United hopes to build up the supply of cleaner fuels and cut emissions without relying heavily on buying carbon offsets.

United is also unique among U.S. airlines for its long-term SAF focus. The company has invested in over 5 different SAF developers, including Fulcrum BioEnergy and Cemvita Factory. With these moves, United aims to secure steady supplies of SAF for its future flights.

Andrew Chang, head of United Airlines Ventures, noted:

“Scaling the SAF industry is the major hurdle air travel needs to clear in order to increase the supply and reduce the price of lower carbon fuels. Twelve has differentiated themselves through the capital they have raised and the SAF contracts they have secured.”

Why SAF Is So Important (and Growing Fast)

The aviation industry is under pressure to cut emissions. Planes account for about 2.5% of global CO2 emissions today, and demand for flights is still growing.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) says airlines used only 300 million liters of SAF in 2022, but demand could grow to 7 billion liters by 2030.

That’s a huge jump, showing just how important SAF is becoming. Some key facts to know about this jet fuel:

Today, SAF makes up less than 1% of all jet fuel used globally.

Experts think the SAF market could be worth over $15 billion by 2030.

SAF can lower lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuel.

Annual SAF demand range over the main and accelerated cases compared with capacity potential, 2020-2026

Even though SAF is good for the planet, it still costs 3 to 5x more than regular jet fuel. That’s why government policies are helping. For example, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) offers tax credits for low-carbon fuels, making SAF cheaper to buy. The European Union also passed rules requiring airlines to use increasing amounts of SAF starting in 2025.

Many believe that as technology improves and more SAF is made, costs will drop to match regular fuel prices by the early 2030s.

How Twelve Fits into the Bigger Picture

Twelve is one of the few companies working on Power-to-Liquid (PtL) SAF, which uses only CO2 and clean energy instead of crops or oils. This means their fuel can be scaled up faster without competing for food or farmland.

In 2023, Twelve opened its first demonstration plant in Moses Lake, Washington, to show that the technology works. Their long-term plan is to build bigger facilities that can produce millions of gallons of PtL SAF each year.

The U.S. Department of Energy has recognized PtL as a promising option for deep decarbonization. Studies show PtL fuels could cut aviation emissions by up to 90%, depending on how clean the electricity source is.

For United, working with Twelve is more than just cutting emissions — it’s about staying ahead of competitors. Many airlines still depend on buying carbon offsets to meet their climate goals. United wants to lead with direct emission cuts, which experts say is a stronger, more reliable strategy.

RELATED: Gevo Strikes Carbon Credit Agreement with Future Energy Global to Scale SAF Market

What Other Airlines Are Doing

United isn’t the only airline betting on SAF:

Delta Air Lines partnered with Gevo to buy 385 million gallons of SAF over seven years.

American Airlines signed a deal with Aemetis for 350 million gallons over 10 years.

Lufthansa, KLM, and British Airways are also working with SAF producers like Neste and Velocys.

However, most of these deals are focused on SAF made from used cooking oil, fats, and biomass — not PtL. United’s early and large investment in Power-to-Liquid SAF sets it apart from airlines still relying mostly on crop-based or waste oil SAF.

What’s Next? A Greener Future for Aviation

The future of flight is changing fast. Analysts predict that investments like United’s could speed up a major shift in aviation. As governments around the world set stricter rules on emissions and offer more support for low-carbon technologies, SAF use is expected to soar.

If SAF production grows as hoped, airlines could shrink their carbon footprints by 40% to 70% in the next 20 years.

United’s investment in Twelve and other clean fuel companies shows it’s not just following the trend — it’s trying to shape the future of sustainable travel. The airline’s plan is to use a mix of SAF sources, from waste oils to PtL fuels, to make sure it can meet rising demand.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2039047598.jpg,N,,2025-05-12 13:57:07.241045

Iowa’s farmers and biofuel producers are ready to lead, but Washington’s overregulation is shutting them out of the SAF market.
That’s how Iowa farmers can fully benefit from their efficient practices—and how we can ensure America retains control of its energy future.","Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District is home to some of the most productive farmland in the country, and agriculture has long been the backbone of our state’s economy. But with shifting market demands, Iowa farmers are facing the real risk of declining farm income, shrinking cash receipts, and fewer opportunities to grow and compete.

Fortunately, there’s a major opportunity that could reverse these trends and bring in economic growth for rural Iowa: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

SAF is jet fuel made from biomass products like farm crops and agricultural waste—resources that are abundant in Iowa. SAF was developed to enhance and support fossil fuels in commercial aircraft that millions of consumers are flying in today.

Fuel consumption by commercial airlines has been rising steadily. In 2023 alone, the global aviation industry consumed 91 billion gallons of jet fuel. That figure jumped to 99 billion in 2024 and is expected to continue climbing. This is a largely untapped market where Iowa’s farmers should be leading.

With the right policies, SAF can open a new revenue stream for American farmers, create good-paying jobs in the biofuel sector, support rural economies, and bolster our national energy security by increasing our domestic fuel supply.

Although current federal policies have supported early growth of SAF, Congress must now work with President Trump to ensure that SAF is a pillar of his American energy dominance agenda. That starts with giving energy producers the long-term confidence they need—making it clear the federal government is committed to scaling U.S. domestic SAF production.

By stimulating private investment, we can enable the construction of new facilities and expanded operations to meet the aviation industry’s growing fuel demands. This growth would position Iowa as a leading SAF hub, supporting more than 22,000 permanent jobs and adding $2.7 billion to the state’s GDP by 2050, according to the agricultural economic research firm Decision Innovation Solutions.

I have long supported cutting onerous red tape that holds back American businesses and stifles innovation. Iowa’s farmers and biofuel producers are ready to lead, but Washington’s overregulation is shutting them out of the SAF market.

Instead of stringent mandates, we need smart, forward-looking policies that give farmers and SAF producers the certainty they need to invest, expand, and innovate. That’s how Iowa farmers can fully benefit from their efficient practices—and how we can ensure America retains control of its energy future.

SAF is meant to work with our existing fossil fuel supply, not replace it. By expanding SAF production, we will help meet growing demand in the aviation sector while driving down fuel prices and improving market stability. More supply means more competition, and that’s good for both the aviation industry and American consumers.

Integrating SAF into our existing fuel mix can lower overall fuel costs while pursuing President Trump’s energy dominance agenda, making sure that the United States—not China—leads the future of aviation fuel.

I have always supported an all-of-the-above and all-of-the-below energy strategy, with biofuels front and center. Investing in domestically produced SAF will reduce our dependence on foreign fuel sources and support rural economies.

We have the technology, the crops, and the workforce to lead. We just need the policies to unlock these opportunities, realize SAF’s wide-ranging benefits, and ensure Iowa remains at the forefront of American energy leadership for decades to come.

“We will continue to develop our existing UK hydrogen projects, a market where there has been significant support from the UK and Scottish Governments, and seek investors to take them forward into construction and operation.

“We are committed to continuing with the other technologies and services we are well known for, including our leading markets and optimisation activities.”

Statkraft’s CEO and president Birgitte Ringstad Vartdal added: “After reducing the ambition level on green hydrogen development last year, we are experiencing even more uncertainty in the market.”

Policy support

Last month, 27 hydrogen projects were shortlisted for the next stage of the UK Government’s Second Hydrogen Allocation Round 2 (HAR2) support scheme.

The shortlist includes projects across England, Scotland, and Wales that could use hydrogen to decarbonise their manufacturing and industrial practices to tackle the climate crisis.

Some of the lead developers for the projects include Scottish Power, Uniper Hydrogen UK, Centrica Energy Storage, and EDF Renewables Hydrogen.

The HAR2 government support allows projects to apply for funding for capital expenditure through the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund and then ongoing revenue support through the hydrogen business production until its hydrogen levy on energy bills comes into effect in 2025.

The 27 shortlisted projects are all green hydrogen projects, whereby hydrogen is produced via electrolysis processes with water that are powered by renewable electricity. Hydrogen produced from the shortlisted projects would serve a range of industries including glass manufacturing, brick making, ammonia production and the production of alternative aviation fuels.

Energy minister Sarah Jones said: “We are deploying hydrogen at a commercial scale for the first time – not just investing in technology – but investing in British jobs, our proud manufacturing communities and our energy security.

The five-day event, held from May 5 to 9, 2025, in Lagos, brought together stakeholders from 14 African countries, international organisations and SAF project developers to address access to finance, investment risks, and project bankability.

According to a statement signed by Michael Achimugu, Director of Public Affairs and Consumer Protection, the event underscored Nigeria’s commitment to climate action and sustainable aviation, while fostering regional cooperation.

Organized by the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) in collaboration with the National Council on Climate Change Secretariat (NCCCS) and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the workshop formed part of the Assistance, Capacity Building, and Training for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (ACT-SAF) Africa–India Project.

A highlight of the workshop, as contained in the statement was the formal inauguration of six Technical Working Groups (TWGs) by Chris Najomo, NCAA Director General. These TWGs which includes ; Policy and Regulation; Feedstock and Production; Funding and Investment; Technology and Innovation; Environmental and Social Impact; and Infrastructure and Logistics, will guide Nigeria’s SAF development across key thematic areas.

The final two days of the workshop were dedicated to the Nigeria Engagement on SAF, which focused on developing a domestic roadmap for SAF production and deployment.

The hybrid workshop, themed “Access to Finance for SAF Production,” aimed to confront real-world challenges faced by SAF developers and financiers. It explored de-risking strategies, financial instruments, and the roles of various actors in creating a viable SAF ecosystem in Africa.

Participants included representatives from the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC), EU delegations to Nigeria and Western and Central African (WACAF), and other global aviation and climate stakeholders.

Speaking at the opening session, Chris Najomo, represented by Bukola Teriba, NCAA’s Regional Manager for Lagos, emphasised the importance of securing financing for SAF projects to reduce aviation’s environmental footprint and achieve ICAO’s Long-Term Aspirational Goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.",https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sustainable-aviation-fuel-financing.png,N,,2025-05-12 12:56:24.443369

Brazil and China are boosting their economic alliance, with Brazil sealing a $1 billion deal with Envision Energy for sustainable aviation fuel and courting other Chinese giants for tech and defense projects.

What does this mean?

In a strategic move during President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's visit to China, Brazil secured a significant $1 billion investment from Envision Energy to produce sustainable aviation fuel using sugarcane. This partnership is part of a broader economic collaboration, as Lula da Silva met with key Chinese firms like automaker GAC and defense company Norinco. These interactions signal Brazil's intent to weave tighter economic ties with China. Additionally, Brazil seeks to amp up its digital infrastructure, with efforts to attract investment in data centers. Beijing-based ByteDance, famed for TikTok, is contemplating data center deployment at Pecem port, bolstered by a staggering planned investment of 50 billion reais ($8.82 billion). Moreover, Brazil's Ministry of Mines and Energy is set to work with China's Windey Energy Technology and Senai Cimatec on renewable energy projects, marking another segment of this comprehensive cooperation.

The firm said that the fund exceeded its fundraising target, and was oversubscribed at more than $240 million.

ASP6 is Aligned Climate Capital’s largest infrastructure fund to date. The fund acquires construction-ready distributed solar projects from development partners across the U.S., finances their build-out, and delivers returns through tax credit monetization, operating income distributions, and portfolio sales to institutional infrastructure investors.

The firm’s investment strategy focuses on the “middle market” of solar, and typically targets underserved and rural markets. Aligned Climate finances construction with a combination of equity and construction debt, then monetizes the tax credits and secures long-term, low-cost permanent debt.

To date, ASP6 has placed more than 25MW of distributed solar projects in service in Maine and Washington, D.C., and has acquired additional solar projects in other states, which are under construction or scheduled to begin over the next two years. The firm said that ASP6 is scheduled to make its initial cash distribution to investors in 2025 and plans to make annual cash distributions going forward, and then ultimately selling the operating portfolio to institutional investors following the tax recapture period.

Peter W. Davidson, CEO of Aligned Climate Capital, said:

Mega-cap tech companies are expected to report mixed results related to their core businesses and provide varied guidance this earnings season. Management commentary on outlooks will be key, particularly in light of the effect that tariffs may have on tech companies’ operations. A significant concern is whether cloud service providers will maintain their substantial capital expenditure growth in fiscal 2025, as this will influence their ability to scale and innovate.

There has also been a surge in investment in technology infrastructure to support generative AI. This trend, which gained traction over the past year, is anticipated to continue. However, while operating expense growth projections have diminished, the accelerated pace of AI-related capex has raised alarms.

Global solar additions to stall in 2026 on policy, market uncertainty: SolarPower Europe

SolarPower Europe expects global solar photovoltaic installations to slow in 2025 and stagnate in 2026 due to mixed policy signals and geopolitical instability. In 2025, global solar PV additions are projected to grow 10% year over year to 655 GW, down from 33% year-over-year growth in 2024. Stagnation is expected in 2026, with additions reaching only 665 GW.

Growth is then anticipated to resume to 2029, with annual increases of 10% to 14%. However, the forecast for installations during 2026–2028 was revised down to 2.27 TW from 2.34 TW. The slowdown in 2026 is attributed to a new renewable power pricing mechanism in China that may delay investment decisions, potential impacts from rising import tariffs and international trade tensions.",https://spglobal.scene7.com/is/image/spglobalcom/4-gettyimages-909084582-1360x320?$responsive$,N,,2025-05-12 12:56:27.841929

“I am probably spending about 30-40% of my time just ensuring the fleet works and getting aircraft through the door and so forth.
“Anyone who says it will go away by the end of the year doesn’t know what they are talking about,” he says.
Oman, like Saudia Arabia, has a transformation and economic diversification strategy, Vision 2040, of which tourism is a key pillar.
“How do you deliver Oman’s requirements for its aviation sector, if the OEMs aren’t enabling that?” asks Hamilton-Manns.","During a wide-ranging panel session at IATA’s Aviation Day Middle East North Africa in Jeddah on 7 May, the chief executives of carriers in the region laid bare the extent to which the supply chain challenges, which have plagued the industry since the pandemic, are impacting their day-to-day business.

“It is a real issue,” said Stephen Greenway, chief executive of Saudi Arabian low-cost carrier Flyadeal. “I am probably spending about 30-40% of my time just ensuring the fleet works and getting aircraft through the door and so forth. For a CEO, that is an inordinate amount of time.”

He notes that while the delays in aircraft deliveries are the most visible impact, the issues cascade well beyond that.

“I have two aircraft in Toulouse without engines and I don’t know when I’m going to get them; spare parts are hard to come by; even getting one of our aircraft certified for ETOPS by the end of the year, I can’t get the oxygen tanks for the aircraft, line-fit or retroft.”

He adds: “It's May and I don’t know what my fleet is going to be for the summer peak at this moment in time. We hope to work that out in the next couple of weeks. We were meant to be getting two aircraft prior to the summer that would complete a full aircraft fleet to go into the summer, that’s just not happening.”

Neither does Greenway hold out hopes for a quick resolution to supply chain issues.

“Anyone who says it will go away by the end of the year doesn’t know what they are talking about,” he says. “This is with us for the next three-to-five years, minimum.”

Chief executive of Omani low-cost carrier SalamAir, Adrian Hamilton-Manns concurs and points to the challenge it creates, particularly for carriers that are looking to grow. SalamAir is looking to add 10 more Airbus A320s as it continues on a revamp which has seen it focus back on its core low-cost narrowbody operations.

“We need to get bigger quicker. But we are not going to be able to do that for three or four years. If we were a widebody operator, which we are not, we would not be able to get widebodies until about 2032, 2023. A waiting time of six years to fulfil a business plan you are looking at today is just impossible,” he said

This inability to ramp up creates issues in meeting the wider strategic goals of states in the region. Oman, like Saudia Arabia, has a transformation and economic diversification strategy, Vision 2040, of which tourism is a key pillar.

“How do you deliver Oman’s requirements for its aviation sector, if the OEMs aren’t enabling that?” asks Hamilton-Manns. “We’ve had a very visible issue with that this year in our civil aviation authority believing both ourselves and Oman Air are not going to have aircraft available to meet the demands of travel in the summer.”

This has prompted Oman’s aviation regulator to temporarily open up the market to foreign operators to fly domestic services during the summer peak. “That’s not a reflection of SalamAir’s abilities to carry passengers, or Oman Air’s,” he adds saying It’s a reflection of manufacturing not giving airlines what they need.

Leaders also flagged the fragmented regulatory environment, particularly around sustainability.

Gulf Air chief executive Jeffery Goh, for example, says that individual regulatory bodies need to recognise the industry is international.“For instance, I look at the regulations across the world on sustainability, reductions in greenhouse emissions, requirements for sustainable aviation fuel. It’s almost a repeat of what played out in Covid 19. Every country reacted it in its own way,” he said.",https://www.timesaerospace.aero/sites/aerospace/times/files/ta-favico.jpg,N,,2025-05-12 10:56:29.391212

Modernised trade The UK-India FTA offers more than just tariff relief; it presents a structural inflection point for cross-border air cargo.
If implemented effectively, the deal could position the UK-India corridor as one of the most dynamic east-west air cargo routes by the end of the decade.","The finalisation of the UK-India Free Trade Agreement (FTA) on 7 May 2025 is being hailed as a landmark achievement in bilateral economic diplomacy, with strategic implications for air cargo connectivity and policy frameworks between the two nations. As India emerges as a pivotal export manufacturing base and the UK seeks to diversify post-Brexit trade lanes, the FTA is expected to catalyse both directional cargo flows and systemic adjustments in cross-border logistics.

According to estimates released by the UK government, the agreement is expected to increase annual bilateral trade by £25.5 billion over the long term and contribute £4.8 billion annually to UK GDP. These projections, while headline-grabbing, also underscore a more complex operational reality for air cargo professionals: rising volumes, tighter lead times, and the need for synchronised policy reforms to support trade facilitation and infrastructure.

Tariff reductions

The agreement eliminates tariffs on over 90% of UK exports to India by value, directly impacting sectors with high air freight affinity such as automotive components, medical devices, and premium consumer goods. Notably, the phased reduction of tariffs on British whisky—from 150% to 40% over 10 years—and on luxury vehicles—down from over 100% to 10%—is likely to drive greater utilisation of bellyhold capacity, especially for high-value time-definite shipments.

Conversely, the UK will grant duty-free access to 99% of Indian exports by volume, with textiles, leather goods, and jewellery expected to benefit disproportionately. India’s apparel sector alone exported nearly $5 billion to the UK in FY 2023–24, and analysts expect this figure to rise by 15–20% annually under the new regime. Given the just-in-time nature of global fashion and e-commerce logistics, much of this incremental demand is likely to flow through air cargo channels.

Implications for networks and infrastructure

To accommodate this anticipated surge, both nations will need to reassess and expand current air cargo capacities. While major gateways—such as Delhi, Mumbai, Heathrow, and East Midlands—are expected to absorb a large share of the volume, second-tier airports with airside cargo handling potential could be leveraged to decongest primary hubs.

Revisiting the UK-India bilateral air service agreement (ASA) may be essential to enable higher flight frequencies, open skies arrangements for freighters, and fifth-freedom rights for intermediate stops. These policy adjustments could allow integrators and combination carriers to optimise their networks for rising volumes on the UK-India corridor.

Further, there is a growing need to invest in cold chain infrastructure, bonded warehouse integration, and real-time cargo visibility tools—particularly at Indian airports, where legacy handling infrastructure continues to constrain turnaround times. Trade facilitation improvements such as advance customs data integration, single-window clearances, and adoption of WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) standards will be critical

Sustainability and regulatory considerations

With the anticipated increase in cargo traffic, sustainability challenges come into sharper focus. Aviation accounts for approximately 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions, and growing air freight movements risk intensifying that share unless mitigated by proactive policy.

Air cargo operators and shippers will be under pressure to invest in lower-emission aircraft, optimise load factors, and adopt Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) solutions—despite current cost premiums that exceed three times the price of conventional jet fuel. From a regulatory standpoint, convergence between EU and UK carbon market mechanisms and India’s emerging SAF policy framework could help harmonise compliance pathways.

Carbon border adjustment mechanisms (CBAM) and enhanced ESG disclosures are also likely to influence routing and carrier selection, adding another dimension to air cargo planning.

Broader policy synergies

The FTA’s rollout coincides with India’s National Logistics Policy (NLP) and Gati Shakti infrastructure push, which aim to reduce logistics costs from 13–14% of GDP to below 8% by 2030. From the UK side, the Department for Business and Trade’s push to establish the UK as a hub for digital and green trade aligns with the expected use of digitised shipping documentation, AI-driven customs screening, and standardised eAWBs for UK-India cargo.

Additionally, the agreement includes provisions on services, intellectual property, and labour standards, which could indirectly support the development of specialised air cargo services, such as life sciences logistics and cross-border e-commerce.

Modernised trade

The UK-India FTA offers more than just tariff relief; it presents a structural inflection point for cross-border air cargo. For stakeholders across airports, carriers, freight forwarders, and regulatory agencies, the agreement demands a proactive re-evaluation of capacity planning, digital integration, policy coordination, and environmental compliance.

If implemented effectively, the deal could position the UK-India corridor as one of the most dynamic east-west air cargo routes by the end of the decade.

Like its global peers, Eneos is shifting its business portfolio to align with the energy transition.

""But the trend toward a carbon-neutral society is slowing, and the full-scale bifurcation of the energy transition, previously expected around 2030, may be delayed,"" Miyata said, adding the company is in no rush to supply hydrogen and ammonia.

In the new plan, Eneos has removed its previous target of supplying up to 4 million metric tons of hydrogen by the fiscal 2040 year.

Eneos already holds stake in LNG projects in Asia, but Miyata said U.S. projects, including Alaska LNG, could be considered if economically viable.

The refiner reported a 22 per cent decline in net profit for the year ended March 31 and forecast a 18 per cent drop for the current year.

It aims to raise its refinery run rate, excluding scheduled maintenance, to 90 per cent by fiscal 2027, up from 78 per cent in 2024.

,,2025-05-12 12:21:43+00:00,The Conversation,Governments shouldn't chase growth at all costs. The harms of over tourism show why,"Ilaria Pappalepore, Ko Koens, Shirley Nieuwland",,,,,https://theconversation.com/governments-shouldnt-chase-growth-at-all-costs-the-harms-of-over-tourism-show-why-255038,"In the controversial case of expansion at Heathrow airport, the UK government insists that the benefits of economic growth outweigh the environmental and wellbeing costs.
This provides options to rethink what tourism could look like when the focus is not just economic growth.
Falling under the umbrella term of “post-growth”, there are various approaches that all rethink the role of economic growth.
On the other hand, “doughnut economics” and regenerative approaches are more agnostic about economic growth.
But they cannot do much as long as economic growth is the focus of the Dutch government’s plans.","In the controversial case of expansion at Heathrow airport, the UK government insists that the benefits of economic growth outweigh the environmental and wellbeing costs. But what if focusing on prosperity is a shortsighted approach? The debate about a third runway, placed in the context of exponential growth in travel and tourism, makes the impact on people and the environment clear to see.

Tourism accounts for an estimated 8% of global CO2 emissions, and emissions related to tourism will continue to grow despite technological advances. The Heathrow expansion, for example, has been shown to be incompatible with net-zero requirements.

Meanwhile, many tourism destinations are struggling to cope with growing numbers of visitors. Residents have protested at the impact of overtourism on their quality of life, with harms including overcrowding, loss of amenities for residents and a skewed property market.

London’s airport development plans (expansion is also mooted at Gatwick and Luton) aim to inject investment into a range of sectors beyond tourism. However, our research suggests that aligning tourism with other sectors and better cooperation of decision-making at different levels of government could lead to increased wellbeing, a healthier environment and greater benefits to the local economy.

This provides options to rethink what tourism could look like when the focus is not just economic growth.

It should be possible to look at new models that take a holistic approach to tourism development. This means putting the wellbeing of the community and the environment first. Falling under the umbrella term of “post-growth”, there are various approaches that all rethink the role of economic growth. They advocate prioritising human wellbeing within planetary boundaries.

“Degrowth” argues that limiting growth is essential for a sustainable future. On the other hand, “doughnut economics” and regenerative approaches are more agnostic about economic growth. They argue that human prosperity and wellbeing should be prioritised regardless of whether GDP is going up or down.

In the context of tourism and travel, these approaches provide a different perspective on the role of the sector and what it can bring to a place, beyond economic growth.

They also go further than most strategies being implemented in popular tourist cities to prioritise residents’ wellbeing, quality of life, and lower-carbon travel.

Taking the heat off tourist hotspots

As part of a net-zero emission pledge, and in an attempt to curb overtourism and the frustration of locals, some cities across Europe are enforcing restrictions on cruise ships. And Greece is applying a climate resilience tax on top of the tourism tax on all overnight stays.

One of the cities that has done the most to curb tourism is Amsterdam. After the start of the COVID pandemic, it adopted a citizen initiative to cap tourism at 20 million overnight stays per year.

This number was reached in 2023, and the city has put forward a wide range of measures since then. These include a tourist tax rate of 12.5%, strict rules on short-term rentals, limits on visitor numbers at large attractions and reducing the number of cruises. The city has also strengthened its environmental regulations.

Copenhagen, on the other hand, chooses not to restrict tourism. Rather, it now rewards visitors who engage in climate-friendly actions, with the “CopenPay” pilot project. Visitors who choose to cycle, use public transport or participate in volunteering are eligible for discounts or free access to 24 attractions.

While these initiatives are laudable, there are two reasons why they don’t go far enough.

The first is that the majority of the measures are based on financial disincentives, such as charging entrance fees to destinations and taxing the most polluting transport. They rest on the assumption that we do not need to address the underlying pursuit of growth that led to this unsustainability.

Likewise, arguments in favour of green growth are based on technological advances, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This underpins claims that air travel can continue to grow. However, both within and beyond the travel sector, it has been argued that green growth is a myth.

Read more: There isn't enough 'sustainable' aviation fuel to make a dent in our emissions – and there won't be for years

In the long run, these measures do not cut the ever-growing number of travellers. Nor do they effectively address climate issues.

Second, cities need support from higher levels of government if they want to encourage travel that is more environmentally friendly and contributes to the wellbeing of residents. In the case of Amsterdam, the ongoing expansion of Schiphol airport can be linked to overtourism, as well as noise and air pollution.

City leaders want to cut the maximum number of flights. But they cannot do much as long as economic growth is the focus of the Dutch government’s plans.

This highlights the deep complexities of controlling visitor numbers. And it also suggests that the economic benefits that come with the growth of London’s airports may come with societal and environmental costs. These will be felt by London and its residents, and cannot be solved with local policies.

Rather than going further and faster with growth, when it comes to travel and tourism we may need to go “closer by and slower”.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/666532/original/file-20250507-62-dmn4zm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C275%2C5176%2C2588&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-05-12 08:56:12.559656

Thursday's agreement will see Britain's 19% tariffs on U.S. ethanol fall to zero through a 1.4 billion-litre (370 million gallon) quota - a figure equating to the size of the UK's entire ethanol market today.

Producers Associated British Foods and Ensus, which operate bioethanol facilities at Teesside and Hull in northern England, together account for nearly all of the UK's bioethanol production capacity.

Along with supply chain partners, they support thousands of jobs. Both said the operating environment ""is now impossible"".

""This (tariff) change comes on top of regulations that give overseas producers an unfair advantage in the British market,"" Paul Kenward, CEO of ABF Sugar, and Grant Pearson, chairman of Ensus, said in a joint statement.

""This vital sector is now facing imminent collapse because of the trade deal. In our current situation, we will have to close these plants,"" they said, going further than a statement AB Foods made on Friday.

Bioethanol is produced from crops like wheat and sugar cane and is used to make petrol. Byproducts of its production include animal feed and carbon dioxide, the latter facing severe shortages in 2022.

Britain's National Farmers' Union has warned the ethanol measure could mean the loss of a profitable outlet for arable growers which supply the industry.

ABF Sugar and Ensus jointly purchase more than two million tonnes of wheat annually.

""We are fast approaching the point where we need to decide whether to sign new contracts. In the current conditions, that would be irresponsible,"" they said, calling for ""urgent government action"".

Britain's concession on ethanol and beef was made in return for the removal of 25% additional tariffs on steel and aluminium, and a quota of 100,000 cars at a duty of 10%.

A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said officials from the Department for Business and Trade had met the affected companies, and that ""close engagement will continue in the coming weeks and months"".

The company’s Net ZERO Reverse programme aims to reduce the carbon footprint and financial costs of air freight by exclusively utilising ocean freight to return containers.
Second, we needed to address the significant problem of reverse logistics, which is where our Net ZERO Reverse program comes into play.
“Switching to ocean freight reduces CO2 emissions by more than 99 percent compared to airfreight,” Samsonowicz stated.
Our hardware and software solutions help eliminate these issues, leading to significant CO2 reductions and cost savings today.","The cold chain has seen significant expansion in recent years. With the industry’s growth, ensuring sustainability has become increasingly crucial, not just as an add-on but as a key point of the sector’s DNA.

“We don’t view sustainability as a change; it’s a testament to who we are as a company,” Radek Samsonowicz, Vice President of Sales for Containers at SkyCell, said. “If sustainability isn’t deeply embedded in your company’s DNA, you’re essentially playing catch-up.

“From the design of our products to our processes and the way we treat our solutions—whether hardware or software—sustainability is at the core of it all.”

This becomes particularly clear in one of the key challenges in the sector – the global trade imbalance in pharmaceuticals, particularly the enormous disparity between exports and imports between Western markets and Asia.

“The European Union and the United States export ten times more life-saving products to Asia than they import from there,” Samsonowicz explained. “ This situation has resulted in a huge number of containers and reusable packaging that need to be returned by air. This model creates enormous costs—hundreds of millions of dollars every year for pharma clients—and contributes to a massive CO2 footprint.

Applicable solution

SkyCell has taken steps to tackle this issue by focusing on reverse logistics. The company’s Net ZERO Reverse programme aims to reduce the carbon footprint and financial costs of air freight by exclusively utilising ocean freight to return containers.

“First, we looked at product design: Can we make the containers lighter? Can we optimise the use of space to reduce the number of containers needed? Second, we needed to address the significant problem of reverse logistics, which is where our Net ZERO Reverse program comes into play. This programme is designed to tackle this issue head-on, reducing both costs and emissions associated with airfreight.

“Switching to ocean freight reduces CO2 emissions by more than 99 percent compared to airfreight,” Samsonowicz stated. “Additionally, this solution eliminates the problem of extended lease days, cutting costs and improving efficiency.”

Partnering up for progress

The shift to ocean freight reflects a larger trend in the cold chain: moving away from siloed, individualistic approaches to more collaborative partnerships. SkyCell’s partnerships with airlines like Emirates and United have paved the way for this transformation. “By removing reverse logistics via air, airlines can open up new revenue streams,” he noted. “They recognise the benefits of reducing CO2 emissions and are keen to be part of this change. It’s a win-win for everyone involved.”

The industry has long awaited solutions like SkyCell’s, which offer immediate, actionable steps to reduce emissions today rather than waiting for future technologies like hydrogen or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to become widespread.

“We can’t afford to wait 10 or 20 years,” said Samsonowicz. “The biggest levers right in front of us are cost savings and reducing product loss. Our hardware and software solutions help eliminate these issues, leading to significant CO2 reductions and cost savings today.

“Since launching this programme in the US two weeks ago, the conversations we’ve had with pharma shippers, forwarders, and airlines have been amazing.

“It’s clear that the industry has been waiting for this kind of solution. We’re proud that SkyCell is leading the way, pushing innovation, and taking a brave, ambitious approach to change the market. It’s an exciting time, and we’re thrilled about what comes next.”

Scalable solution

With a successful launch in the US, Samsonowicz is optimistic about the global scalability of the solution. “Our Net ZERO Reverse program is ready to be implemented immediately in markets. We don’t have to wait; the solution is available now,” he explained.

“From today, we can tackle trade imbalances in regions like Europe and the US to China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the Middle East—markets that consume a significant amount of life-saving medicines but don’t export much in return.

“We’ve made the leap and invested heavily in the fleet required to manage this activity, particularly in terms of handling reverse logistics by ocean freight. This is a significant step forward, and we’re proud to be leading the way in this area.”

Freight forwarders are seeing the value of this solution. By streamlining operations and improving communication, they are able to offer cleaner, more efficient services to their pharmaceutical clients, resulting in a more effective and sustainable supply chain overall.

“SkyCell’s initiative represents a win-win-win scenario for airlines, pharma clients, and freight forwarders alike,” Samsonowicz declared. “As for competitors, the response is still uncertain. This is a relatively new concept, and while others may follow suit, the significant capital investment required to implement such a solution presents a barrier. Not all companies will have the resources to take on this challenge, making SkyCell’s early investment a bold and forward-thinking move.”",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cropped-Favicon_ACW-265x265.png,N,,2025-05-12 07:56:07.786298

The comments came during an online press conference as the organization released data showing India would be a valuable market for the nation’s corn growers and benefit rural America should the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to open the market to American goods prove effective.

“We applaud the Trump administration for the trade outreach it is conducting with India, and we will advocate over the next few months to encourage the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to include American corn exports in any new trade agreement it makes with the country,” said Illinois farmer and NCGA President Kenneth Hartman Jr. “Building a more level playing field for all American products to access global markets is exactly what corn growers need, especially as we face a projected third consecutive year of negative returns.”

Hartman added that the organization will continue working directly with the Trump administration and the media to highlight how beneficial an agreement with India would be for the nation’s corn growers.

India’s restrictions on genetically modified corn have blocked access for American corn imports, since 94% of American corn is genetically modified. India also imposes technical restrictions that prevent access for distiller dried grains with solubles, a byproduct from ethanol production used in animal feed and limits U.S. ethanol imports. India’s stance puts U.S farmers at a distinct disadvantage and addressing these barriers would benefit American farmers.
