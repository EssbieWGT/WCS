Metafuels is partnering with Evos Rotterdam to advance development of the plant, named Turbe. Evos, one of Europe’s leading storage companies for liquid energy and chemicals, brings vital infrastructure and operational expertise to the collaboration, underlining its commitment to supporting innovative energy solutions.

This latest project builds on Metafuels’ growing presence across Europe, following the recent announcement of Pizol, a planned production facility in Denmark. Initially, the Rotterdam site will produce 12,000 litres of e-SAF per day, with a second-phase expansion set to increase capacity tenfold to 120,000 litres per day.

Strong Investment Backing and Infrastructure

Metafuels’ rapid expansion is supported by robust financial backing, having raised $22 million in just over two years. This includes a $5 million grant from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, positioning the company among the best-funded SAF startups in Europe.

The Evos Rotterdam terminal—Europe’s largest ethanol storage provider and a dedicated multimodal methanol hub—offers full connectivity by vessel, barge, truck and rail. The facility can store renewable methanol that meets International Methanol Producers and Consumers Association (IMPCA) standards, making it an ideal location for Metafuels’ operations.

Advanced Technology for Scalable, Low-Carbon Aviation Fuel

Metafuels’ patented aerobrew process converts renewable methanol into jet fuel with high energetic efficiency and ultra-high carbon conversion, resulting in a drop-in fuel that reduces lifecycle emissions by up to 90 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. Crucially, it requires no changes to existing aircraft or airport infrastructure.

The technology is flexible, capable of processing both bio-methanol—derived from biological waste—and e-methanol, produced using renewable electricity and captured carbon. This versatility enables the production of both bio-SAF and e-SAF, or a combination of the two, in response to market dynamics.

The need for such innovation is critical. Aviation currently accounts for more than 2 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions—approximately 800 million tonnes. When additional greenhouse gases and climate factors are considered, the sector’s total contribution to global warming increases to around 3.5 percent.

Aligning with EU Net-Zero Mandates

Development of the Turbe facility is progressing steadily, with key milestones already achieved. The next step is the launch of front-end engineering and design, with a final investment decision expected in mid-2026.

The project supports major European decarbonisation initiatives, including RefuelEU Aviation and the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Synthetic SAF is expected to play a pivotal role in meeting the EU’s climate goals, with the bloc’s sub-mandate for synthetic fuels set to begin at 1.2 percent in 2030 and increase to 35 percent by 2050.

Leadership Commentary

Saurabh Kapoor, CEO of Metafuels, stated:

“We have made excellent progress with our technology, and this first-of-a-kind commercial plant represents a major step forward in its deployment. We are very excited about our cooperation with Evos as we work towards delivering the Turbe project. Europe has ambitious decarbonisation targets, but without scalable and affordable SAF production, aviation will struggle to keep up.”

Christiaan Kop, managing director at Evos Rotterdam, added:

“Metafuels is addressing one of the aviation sector’s most urgent challenges. With our infrastructure and operational expertise, we are well positioned to support this sustainable aviation fuel project. This partnership reflects our commitment to scalable, efficient solutions that will drive the industry’s net-zero transition.”

Boudewijn Siemons, CEO of the Port of Rotterdam, also welcomed the development:

“We are delighted that Metafuels has chosen Rotterdam for this new e-SAF facility. Their partnership with Evos and use of existing methanol infrastructure supports our climate goals and strengthens the port’s position as a leading renewable fuels hub.”

This development signals a major step in Europe’s efforts to decarbonise aviation and establishes Rotterdam as a key player in the future of sustainable flight.",https://tankterminals.com/wp-content/themes/tankterminals/src/img/favicon/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-05-17 12:57:02.827374

Dalam forum internasional industri sawit yang dihadiri oleh berbagai pelaku industri hingga regulator global ini, Jatmiko memaparkan langkah transformasi dengan mengangkat tema Enhancing Productivity While Maintaining Sustainability Standards in Palm Oil Plantation.

Mengawali paparannya, Jatmiko menjelaskan bahwa fondasi transformasi PalmCo bermula dari keputusan pemerintah pada Desember 2023 untuk menggabungkan sejumlah entitas PT Perkebunan Nusantara ke dalam satu entitas besar bernama PTPN IV PalmCo. Merger besar ini membawa konsekuensi perubahan masif, baik dari sisi sistem, budaya, hingga operasional di lapangan.

“Kami menghadapi tantangan besar di awal, mulai dari disparitas budaya kerja, sistem manajemen yang tidak seragam, hingga realita bahwa industri ini sangat bergantung pada tenaga kerja atau labor intensive. Transformasi ini harus dilakukan dari hulu ke hilir,” ujar Jatmiko.

Lebih lanjut, ia menyebut bahwa saat ini PTPN IV PalmCo merupakan perusahaan perkebunan kelapa sawit dengan luas areal terbesar di dunia. Aset perkebunan perusahaan tersebar di berbagai wilayah, mulai dari Sumatera, Jawa, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, hingga sebagian kecil di Papua.

Namun, menurut Jatmiko keberhasilan pengelolaan perkebunan tidak semata ditentukan oleh luasan lahan, jenis tanaman atau iklim melainkan ini tentang manusia, bagaimana cara menyikapi dan merawat tanaman, serta mengelola sumber daya secara bijak.

Sebagai bagian dari transformasi, manajemen PalmCo sejak awal telah mendorong digitalisasi proses bisnis secara menyeluruh. Salah satu terobosannya adalah pengembangan sistem PalmCo Business Cockpit, sebuah platform digital berbasis ERP SAP yang menyatukan data operasional perusahaan dan memungkinkan pengambilan keputusan secara real-time.

“Sistem ini kami rancang sebagai single source of truth, yang memastikan bahwa seluruh data dan keputusan manajerial memiliki dasar yang akurat dan dapat dipertanggungjawabkan,” kata Jatmiko.

Lebih lanjut, PalmCo juga mengemban peran strategis sebagai BUMN yang berpihak pada masyarakat. Salah satunya diwujudkan dalam dukungan terhadap program Peremajaan Sawit Rakyat (PSR).

Jatmiko menyampaikan bahwa pemerintah menargetkan PalmCo untuk mendukung penanaman kembali 60.000 hektare lahan plasma hingga 2026 sebagai dukungan terhadap sekitar 120.000 petani dan keluarga. Hingga tahun ini, perusahaan telah berhasil merealisasikan penerbitan rekomendasi atas 20.000 hektare program PSR bersama petani mitra.

“Transformasi kami tidak bisa dilakukan sendirian. Kami menyadari pentingnya keterlibatan masyarakat, terutama petani sawit. Karena itu, kami juga aktif memerangi peredaran bibit palsu dengan mendorong penggunaan bibit unggul bersertifikat. Ini kami lakukan untuk memastikan produktivitas petani bisa meningkat secara signifikan,” tuturnya.

Menurut Jatmiko, langkah ini sangat menguntungkan semua pihak. Bagi petani, peningkatan hasil panen berarti peningkatan pendapatan. Sementara bagi pelaku industri, mereka akan menerima Tandan Buah Segar (TBS) dengan kualitas prima yang mendukung produktivitas dan efisiensi pabrik kelapa sawit.

Tidak hanya itu, PalmCo juga memberdayakan UMKM lokal melalui program penyediaan alat panen. Jatmiko menyebut bahwa saat ini sebagaian alat panen di salah satu Regional PalmCo diproduksi oleh para pandai besi lokal yang tergabung dalam koperasi binaan.

PalmCo juga mencatatkan tonggak prestasi dalam inisiatif dekarbonisasi dan circular economy. Hingga saat ini, PalmCo telah mengoperasikan 11 unit Pembangkit Listrik Tenaga Biogas (PLTBg) dengan total kapasitas 12,05 MW. Ke depan, Perusahaan akan membangun 29 unit fasilitas Bio-CNG hingga 2030 dan satu unit Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) yang ditargetkan mulai beroperasi pada 2027.

“Beberapa waktu lalu, kami juga mendapat apresiasi dari Menteri Lingkungan Hidup yang bekunjung ke salah satuuni amiyaiu KS Lubuk Dalam yang berada di iak, Riau karena menjadi Perusahaan perkebunan pertama di Indonesia yang meraih Sertifikat Penurunan Emisi Gas Rumah Kaca (SPE-GRK). Ini merupakan bentuk pengakuan atas upaya serius kami menjalankan agenda dekarbonisasi,” ujar Jatmiko.

Ia menambahkan bahwa inisiatif dekarbonisasi ini tidak hanya berdampak pada penurunan emisi karbon, tetapi juga berkontribusi besar terhadap peningkatan citra industri sawit Indonesia di mata global khususnya Eropa.

“Dekarbonisasi sangat penting untuk memperkuat persepsi bahwa industri kelapa sawit kita adalah industri yang peduli lingkungan, berkelanjutan, dan siap memenuhi tuntutan pasar global yang makin ketat. Ini penting untuk keberlanjutan industri dan juga untuk keberlangsungan lingkungan hidup kita bersama,” pungkas Jatmiko menutup paparannya.",https://www.elaeis.co/foto_berita/2025/05/small_2025-05-17-jatmiko-ungkap-kunci-transformasi-palmco-di-palmex-internasional-2025.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 14:56:16.221753

Rencana Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM) menerapkan program mandatori bioavtur atau Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) berpotensi membuat harga tiket pesawat melonjak.

Pengamat Penerbangan, Alvin Lie, mengatakan kebijakan tersebut harus didiskusikan bersama Kementerian Perhubungan dan asosiasi maskapai (INACA), karena akan berdampak besar pada biaya operasional maskapai.

""Pada ujung-ujungnya ini akan berdampak pada harga tiket yang akan naik sangat signifikan,"" ungkapnya saat dihubungi kumparan, Sabtu (17/5).

Alvin mencontohkan, Singapura akan mewajibkan maskapai menggunakan bioavtur dengan campuran 1 persen mulai tahun ini. Kenaikan biaya dibebankan kepada tiket pesawat yang akan naik hingga USD 50.

""Itu akan berdampak kepada setiap tiket yang berangkat dari Singapura ada kenaikan USD 30 sampai 50. Bayangkan kalau ini diberlakukan di Indonesia, harga tiket akan naiknya luar biasa,"" tegasnya.

Namun, berbeda dengan Singapura, Alvin menyebutkan pemerintah Indonesia membatasi pergerakan harga tiket pesawat domestik melalui kebijakan tarif batas atas (TBA).

Jika mandatori bioavtur berlaku, maka dia meminta agar Kementerian Perhubungan menghitung kembali kebijakan TBA dengan menyesuaikan kenaikan biaya operasional maskapai.

""Kalau tarif batas atasnya tidak dinaikkan, saya yakin maskapai-maskapai penerbangan tidak akan mampu bertahan hidup dan pada ujung-ujungnya ini akan membunuh industri transportasi Indonesia,"" kata Alvin.

Di sisi lain, ketika harga tiket dinaikkan secara signifikan, Alvin meyakini pasar tidak akan kuat untuk menopang beban tersebut sehingga otomatis mengurangi peminat transportasi udara.

""Akan terjadi masalah besar di sini, dalam kondisi seperti ini saja pengguna jasa transportasi udara merasakan bahwa harga tiket Indonesia ini masih tinggi, berharap harga tiket kita bisa lebih turun. Ini kalau dipaksakan tidak akan terjangkau,"" jelasnya.

Dengan demikian, dia mengusulkan Kementerian ESDM dapat menurunkan biaya produksi bioavtur agar setara dengan harga avtur konvensional, sebab jika harganya lebih mahal akan sangat berat bagi industri penerbangan.

""Satu-satunya jalan kalau ini mau dilaksanakan adalah harga avtur itu menjadi standar harga SAF. Jadi harga SAF tidak lebih mahal daripada harga avtur biasa,"" ujar Alvin.

Senada, Pengamat Penerbangan Gatot Rahardjo mengatakan dampak pengenaan mandatori bioavtur kepada industri penerbangan nasional tergantung pada fluktuasi harganya.

""Berdasarkan pengalaman, harga bioavtur bisa beberapa kali lipat dari avtur konvensional. Dengan kondisi sekarang, beban itu nanti akan ditanggung maskapai karena itu akan membuat biaya meningkat, sementara tarif batas atas tidak berubah,"" jelasnya.

Jika pemerintah akan merevisi TBA, lanjut dia, maka kenaikan beban dari mandatori bioavtur mau tidak mau akan ditanggung penumpang. Selain itu, Gatot juga menilai pemerintah perlu memastikan pasokan bioavtur tersedia di seluruh bandara. Jika persiapan tidak matang, maka maskapai akan menanggung beban yang berat.

""Pemerintah harus menyelesaikan semua persoalan itu dulu sebelum menerapkan SAF. Kalau tidak ya beban maskapai akan semakin berat dan bukan tidak mungkin ada maskapai yang bangkrut nantinya,"" tuturnya.

Companies like Triveni Engineering & Industries Ltd (TEIL) have emerged as key contributors to India’s ethanol production ambitions.
India’s ethanol policy must align with Atmanirbhar Bharat, emphasising self-reliance while selectively embracing global collaboration in R&D, innovation, and technology transfer.
With forward-looking policy, industry commitment, and technology adoption, ethanol can evolve into a multi-dimensional, low-carbon energy platform.
The next phase of India’s ethanol journey must be bold, inclusive, and transformative – anchored in sustainability, resilience, and national self-reliance.","The Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) programme has been one of the biggest success stories in India’s quest to achieve sustainability. Over the past few years, blending of ethanol increased from 12.06% in ESY 2022-23 to 19.7 per cent in April 2025, showing the right policy framework by the Government and a remarkable support from the sugar and ethanol industry. India’s ethanol drive has so far added Rs 1,07,580 crore to farmers’ earnings while saving Rs 1,26,210 crore in foreign exchange by curbing crude oil imports.

With India achieving the E20 target ahead of target, the conversation has now shifted towards achieving a potential 30% target by 2030. Achieving this vision will require scalable infrastructure, flexible feedstock usage, and consistent policy frameworks that support sustainable pricing and growth across the value chain.

To transition beyond the 20% ethanol blending milestone, India must adopt a forward-looking roadmap centred on advanced biofuel technologies and integrated systems thinking. A key pillar of this vision is the large-scale deployment of Second-Generation (2G) ethanol technologies that convert agricultural residues into fuel, thus avoiding food-versus-fuel conflicts while enhancing environmental sustainability and food security.

Simultaneously, a faster rollout of Flex-Fuel Vehicles (FFVs) and Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) capable of operating on higher ethanol blends is critical. These vehicles serve as an important bridge between conventional fossil fuel systems and a low-carbon future, offering cleaner, more flexible mobility options.

Creating ethanol-integrated bio-hubs in sugarcane-rich regions is another enabler. These hubs, combining ethanol production with co-generation of bioelectricity, biogas, and biofertilizers, represent a model for resource-efficient, circular rural economies.

Sugar Industry at the Heart of Ethanol Growth

The Indian sugar industry continues to be the foundation of the ethanol economy. Companies like Triveni Engineering & Industries Ltd (TEIL) have emerged as key contributors to India’s ethanol production ambitions. TEIL’s investments in dual-feed distilleries and cutting-edge ethanol technologies have significantly bolstered national blending targets.

TEIL operates advanced distillation facilities across Uttar Pradesh. It has state-of-the-art distilleries spread across Muzaffarnagar (MZN) – 2 facilities, Sabitgarh (SBT), Milak Narayanpur (MNP), Rani Nangal (RNG) and Shamli in Uttar Pradesh. These facilities have the capability to produce Ethanol, Extra Neutral Alcohol (ENA), Rectified Spirit (RS) and Denatured Spirit (SDS). TEIL utilises a mix of sugarcane-based feedstocks as well as grain. Distillers Dried Grain Solubles (DDGS), a co-product produced on grain operations is also sold to premium Institutions and it also manufactures Indian Made Indian Liquor (IMIL) and Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL).

TEIL has also increased its sugarcane crushing capacity from 61,000 TCD to 63,000 TCD for Sugar Season 2024–25, further supporting upstream integration.

Overcoming Bottlenecks

Scaling beyond E20 will require resolving structural challenges—chief among them, feedstock diversification. Continued dependence on sugarcane and surplus FCI rice is unsustainable. India must aggressively promote maize and other non-food biomass to ensure supply chain resilience. Companies like TEIL, with feedstock-diverse distillation infrastructure, play a vital role in this transition, but long-term viability depends on pricing models that reflect input cost realities.

Policy measures will also be pivotal—rationalising GST for FFVs (5%), introducing differential pricing for ethanol fuels, and achieving Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) parity with electric vehicles can unlock consumer adoption. A pricing mechanism linked to the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane can provide the predictability needed for sustained producer investments.

Further, India must invest in innovation—spanning ethanol-to-hydrogen pathways, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production, and carbon capture—to expand ethanol’s utility beyond blending and into broader clean energy use cases.

Balancing Global Pressures with Domestic Priorities

As blending levels rise, international trade dynamics are growing more complex. The United States is seeking greater access to the Indian ethanol market, particularly for fuel-grade imports. However, large-scale imports contradict the foundational goals of India’s Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme—namely, strengthening domestic agriculture and reducing foreign exchange outflows.

India’s ethanol policy must align with Atmanirbhar Bharat, emphasising self-reliance while selectively embracing global collaboration in R&D, innovation, and technology transfer.

A Transformative Opportunity

Ultimately, the road beyond E20 is not just a matter of volume but of vision. Ethanol sits at the confluence of India’s energy, agricultural, and climate goals. With forward-looking policy, industry commitment, and technology adoption, ethanol can evolve into a multi-dimensional, low-carbon energy platform. For leaders like TEIL, sustaining this momentum requires a stable policy environment, feedstock viability, and long-term pricing mechanisms that support continued innovation and capacity growth.

IAG has grown through many mergers and is now one of the most significant forces in the global aviation industry.

Read this article to discover five fascinating facts about IAG that define its history and position it at the forefront of European aviation. These include how IAG has become so large, an interesting failed merger, its environmental leadership, and more.

5 Formed From Several Mergers and Acquisitions

IAG brings together several airlines and cargo carriers under a single umbrella.

IAG is now formed of seven key airlines. Further subsidiaries, such as Aer Lingus Regional and BA CityFlyer, raise this total further. It has reached this size through mergers, acquisitions, and even the founding of new airlines. The group began through a merger between British Airways and Iberia, which was completed in January 2011. The two airlines began trading together with the new holding company name IAG.

One of the airline group's most substantial acquisitions was Aer Lingus in 2015, the culmination of Ireland's flag carrier's privatization (2006-2015). IAG paid 1.36 billion euros to acquire Aer Lingus, succeeding with the third attempt. Due to European Commission regulations, this deal almost fell through, but Aer Lingus and IAG successfully made concessions to ensure the market remained competitive. Margrethe Vestager, the European Commissioner in charge of competition policy, said:

""By obtaining significant concessions from the airlines the Commission has ensured that air passengers will continue to have a choice of airlines at competitive prices after IAG's takeover of Aer Lingus. The five million passengers travelling each year from Dublin and Belfast to London will be able to choose among several strong carriers.""

The first airline created from scratch by IAG was Iberia Express, serving as a subsidiary of Iberia. This carrier operates short and medium-haul routes from Madrid-Barajas Airport that act as feeder flights into Iberia's long-haul network. More recently, IAG created the airline Fly LEVEL SL (LEVEL). This airline entered insolvency in 2020. However, it was revived with IAG confirming plans to acquire an independent air operator's certificate (AOC) for LEVEL in December 2024, allowing the airline to act as a standalone carrier.

4 IAG Botched an Attempt to Acquire Air Europa

European Commission concerns caused the planned acquisition of Air Europa to fall through.

Since its foundation, IAG has been slowly expanding through mergers and acquisitions. However, it hasn't always been successful in pulling these off. In November 2019, IAG launched its attempt to acquire Air Europa, the third-largest Spanish airline, behind Iberia and Vueling. It wanted to pay a billion euros to the airline's owner, Globalia, and aimed to close the deal during 2020 before integrating Air Europa's assets into Iberia.

Negotiations continued until 2021, when both parties agreed the price would be halved due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The deal eventually fell through in the winter of 2021, and both parties sought ways to re-enter negotiations. For example, IAG acquired a 20% stake in Air Europa in August 2022. Things appeared to be moving again in February 2023, when IAG agreed to purchase the airline for 400 million euros.

However, the European Commission stood in its way. The regulator argued that the deal would severely reduce competition in Spanish domestic and cross-Atlantic aviation, and found IAG's efforts to mitigate these concerns insufficient. By August 2024, IAG announced that the European Union's demands were excessive and abandoned the merger permanently. Instead, the airline group announced plans to develop Madrid Airport to rival Europe's major hubs.

3 IAG Has Led In Green Aviation

It is the world's first airline group to make a net-zero commitment for 2050.

IAG is leading the way in aligning the aviation industry with current concerns regarding climate change. It was the first airline group in the world to pledge net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. IAG publishes a ""road map"" each year to update its customers and the industry on its progress towards net-zero. The airline group has also pledged that its airlines will use 10% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2030.

Beyond choosing better aviation fuel, IAG has three pillars to its net-zero strategy. Firstly, it plans to invest 12.6 billion euros in new, more efficient aircraft from 2025-2029. This will provide the airline group with 171 new aircraft. IAG estimates that the planes it invests in will reduce fuel use by 15-40%. IAG will also invest in carbon removal solutions to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and store it. Finally, IAG has invested in market-based carbon offsets since 2012. The airlines group participates in the EU, UK, and Swiss ETS schemes, and supports the global CORSIA scheme.

However, IAG has received some criticism for its net-zero pledges. According to The Guardian, environmental campaigners have called such pledges ""essentially meaningless."" They have shared concerns that the focus is too heavy on offsetting emissions rather than drastically reducing them. IAG has also come under fire due to widespread accusations that the aviation industry is lobbying officials to weaken environmental regulations. More analysis is needed to understand if IAG's pledges are genuine, or simply ""greenwashing"".

IAG's environmental commitments aren't limited to preventing climate change, which is one of several environmental concerns the aviation industry contributes to. In 2025, it aims to hit the ""5 by 2025"" waste targets. These targets are to reduce on-board passenger waste by 20%, office waste by 50% per employee, maintenance waste per unit of activity by 25%, and cargo waste per unit of cargo by 25%. IAG is also aiming for a zero-based approach to single-use plastic.

2 IAG Operates a Loyalty Scheme

You can collect Avios points to have your loyalty rewarded across the group.

When Iberia and British Airways began IAG, they also merged their frequent flyer programs, Air Miles, BA Miles, and Iberia Plus Points. The result was Avios, a frequent-flier scheme that you can use across most of IAG. It is also available for some airlines in the OneWorld alliance, such as Qatar Airways. This carrier switched to Avios as its primary currency in March 2022. Finnair and Loganair have also adopted Avios.

There are many ways that you can collect Avios that aren't limited to booking flights. Avios points can be earned through online shopping, hotel bookings, and more with IAG's partners outside the aviation industry. Likewise, you don't have to spend your Avios points on flights. They can also be used for hotel stays and car rentals, meaning they have many uses throughout your holiday or travels.

Another great advantage of Avios for IAG customers is that they are not locked into one person's account. You can create a household account to share Avios points with up to six household members. It is also possible to transfer Avios to friends and family not in your household.

1 IAG is the Fourth-Largest Airline Group by Market Cap

The group is smaller than Ryanair, United Airlines Holdings, and Delta Air Lines.

In February 2025, Simple Flying reported on the ten largest airline groups by market cap. Analysis of data from Companies Market Cap, listing 71 publicly traded companies in the aviation sector, ranked IAG at fourth with a market cap of $20.49 billion.

The large size of this market cap, indicating successful trading, was put down to diversified strategy, strong brand identity, and popular sustainability initiatives.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/main-image-16_9-3-3.png,N,,2025-05-17 13:56:13.785459

With Travel & Tourism forecast to generate $16.5TN and support over 460MN jobs by 2035, scaling up sustainable fuel isn’t just an environmental challenge.","Dhaka: The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), in collaboration with global consultancy ICF, has today launched a bold new framework urging the entire Travel & Tourism sector to unite in tackling one of its toughest challenges: scaling up the production and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other renewable fuels.

The report, Scaling Up Sustainable Fuel, sets out a practical roadmap for how every business in the sector, no matter its size or role, can help address transport-related emissions and accelerate the shift to cleaner fuels.

Julia Simpson, WTTC President & CEO, said “Sustainable fuel is the single biggest game-changer for Travel & Tourism, but right now, supply falls dangerously short of demand. If we don’t act together, we risk rising costs, limited availability, and stalled climate progress.

“Every hotel, tour operator, travel agency, cruise line and airline has a role to play. This framework gives them the blueprint. Sustainable fuel is not just an environmental necessity; it’s a business imperative and governments must incentivise the production of SAF, not just set targets for the sector.”

Today, SAF accounts for just 0.3pc of global jet fuel use. To meet net-zero targets by 2050, production must increase more than 400-fold – from 1.25BN litres today to over 450BN litres. That will require as many as 6,500 new renewable fuel plants worldwide. Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF) faces similar supply and infrastructure constraints.

Unlike other decarbonisation options, SAF is a ‘drop-in’ solution. It works with existing engines and aircraft. But high production costs, limited infrastructure, and feedstock competition have kept volumes low and prices high – up to 10 times that of conventional fuel.

The new WTTC-ICF framework offers clear, tiered actions for Travel & Tourism stakeholders to engage, whether as Collaborators, Promoters, Adopters, or Investors. From joining campaigns and supplying waste products, to funding production facilities or purchasing sustainable fuel certificates, the report makes it clear: every business can contribute.

Daniel Galpin, ICF Managing Director, stated “Decarbonising transport is a crucial step towards achieving a sustainable tourism sector. While transport industries, particularly aviation with its focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), have recognised the importance of sustainable fuels and are couragesouly working towards a new era, there remains a significant journey ahead.

It is essential for the broader tourism ecosystem to take action and provide support to meet the targets set, as well as to implement both operational and strategic changes required.

“ICF is proud to have collaborated closely with WTTC to identify the roles that tourism stakeholders can adopt and the actions they can take to facilitate the decarbonisation of the sector, thereby contributing to a more sustainable future.”

Real-world case studies show how action is already underway. The Erawan Group is turning hotel waste oil into SAF, in Asia, whilst Jet2 has invested in a UK-based SAF plant using recyclable household waste.

Crucially, the report warns that unless the sector acts collectively, SAF mandates introduced by governments, requiring a 5pc to 10pc blend by 2030, could increase travel costs and limit consumer choice.

It works by using eight electric propellers to blow air over large flaps on the wing, creating additional lift at lower speeds, and is paired with hybrid-electric propellers. “It operates with the landing and takeoff versatility of a helicopter, the quiet of an electric vehicle, and the cost advantage and safety of a fixed-wing, fixed-propeller aircraft,” according to the company.

The aircraft is designed to carry up to 3,000 pounds and travel up to 1,100 nautical miles. The battery charges in-flight.

For commercial use, the goal is to connect smaller communities that lack traditional aviation infrastructure, as well as accommodate areas with strict noise restrictions. The company also aims to enter the cargo and defense markets.

The company says it has secured more than 2,200 pre-orders valued at over $10 billion. The funding will support pre-production and certification.

Hy2gen: $52.3 million

Hy2gen, which is developing tech to produce renewable jet fuel, has raised $52.3 million.

Hy24 led the round, with support from Technip Energies and the fund BenDa (owned by Hy2gen board chair Dana Kallasch).

Germany-based Hy2gen is designing, building, and operating production plants for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other products derived from renewable hydrogen.

The company earlier this year signed an agreement with Vinci Airports to supply SAF to commercial airlines operating at the Lyon-Saint Exupéry Airport in France by 2030.

Fora Travel: $40 Million

Fora Travel, a travel agency that is recruiting newbies as salespeople, has raised $40 million in series C funding. The company did not announce its series B round of $20 million in 2023.

Thrive Capital and Insight Partners co-led the latest two rounds, with support from previous investors Forerunner Ventures and Heartcore Capital.

New York City-based Fora Travel said it works with thousands of travel advisors, 97% of whom are new to the industry. The company recruits them as gig workers and says it provides them training and tools to grow a business. The company provides a tech platform that its travel advisors use to complete bookings on behalf of consumers.

The company says its portfolio includes nearly 6,000 hotels and that it has booked over $1 billion in travel, including 2 million room nights, since it was founded just over three years ago.

Tern: $13 Million

Tern, a booking platform for travel advisors, has raised $13 million in series A funding.

Viewpoint Ventures and Haystack VC led the round, with support from Upfront Ventures.

The startup in 2023 raised a seed round of $4 million led by Upfront Ventures.

Tern, based in the U.S., says its platform includes an AI assistant, trip planner, invoicing, and AI products to generate city guides and packing lists. It’s meant to simplify multiple fragmented office tasks with a single platform.

Bob Ferguson signs funding bills passed by the state Legislature into law.

In March 2023, officials announced plans for the center to be established at Paine Field by 2027. The purpose of the joint venture between Snohomish County and Washington State University would be to collect sustainable aviation fuel samples from around the world and then test them for safety, performance and chemical similarity to conventional jet fuel.

Sen. Marko Liias, D-Everett, helped secure an initial $6.5 state Department of Transportation grant.

Now the center has secured a $10 million anonymous gift, and an additional $10 million legislative appropriation was approved by state lawmakers in a funding package that has yet to be signed by Ferguson, said Snohomish County Executive Dave Somers.

“The new funding will help make the center a reality,” he said.

The new $10 million appropriation is included in the $78 billion two-year budget approved by the state Legislature. Ferguson is expected to approve the budget but has the power to make line-item vetoes from the budget.

Mike Fong, chief of staff for Somers, said the county executive and team met with the governor a month ago, and Ferguson seemed very excited about the center.

“I’m confident he will approve it,” Fong said.

Brionna Aho, a spokesperson for Ferguson, said the governor is currently reviewing the budget with his team.

She did not offer any specifics on the governor’s decision but said he has until Tuesday to make a decision. That is the same day that Somers will speak at the Economic Alliance Snohomish County annual forecast at the Boeing Museum of Flight at Paine Field.

Fong said an 8-acre site has been chosen at Paine Field for the facility and that a multi-million contract is expected to be signed in the next several months with a firm for facility design work.

The tentative schedule is for design work to be completed by the end of 2026 with construction starting in 2027, according to Fong, who said the facility could take 18 months to complete. He said at least another $36 million would be needed to build the facility.

Sustainable aviation fuels are developed without fossil fuels, using plants, sewage and/or food.

The commercial aviation industry has pledged to transition to 100% use of sustainable fuel by 2050.

But it has a long way to meet that goal. Only several percent of the aviation fuel used today is sustainable, said Joshua Heyne, director of the Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab at Washington State University in Pullman.

He said a big issue is making the fuel more affordable. It can cost between two and five times the cost of conventional fuel.

The idea of the facility is to create job growth in Snohomish County, Fong said.

Brazil has taken a decisive step towards sustainability in aviation with a Chinese investment of US$1 billion — equivalent to around R$5,6 billion in direct conversion — aimed at the production of renewable fuel for aircraft, known as SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel).

According to information released this Monday (12), the contribution will be made by Envision Group, a Chinese company that also intends to install a research and development (R&D) center dedicated to renewable energy in the country.

The announcement came during President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's official visit to Beijing, his third in just over two years, and marked four meetings with Chinese executives from the sustainable energy and defense sectors.

“We concluded a hearing with an announcement of a US$1 billion investment for the production of SAF from sugarcane in Brazil. The country will become one of the largest producers of green aviation fuels,” said Minister Rui Costa, from the Civil House, who accompanied the presidential delegation.

Strategic investments for Brazil's energy future

In addition to the commitment to SAF, the agreements signed between Brazil and China cover several renewable energy projects, including initiatives in wind energy, solar energy, hybrid systems and energy storage technologies.

According to representatives of the Brazilian government and ApexBrasil, the investment in SAF is one of the largest ever announced for the sector in the country, demonstrating global interest in Brazil's potential for sustainable development.

Shanghai-based Envision Energy, a globally recognized leader in green technology, will be primarily responsible for the projects.

The company already works on innovative solutions, such as smart wind turbines and advanced energy storage systems, in addition to prioritizing the development of SAF in its global energy transition agenda.

The investment is the result of negotiations that began in 2024, with recent meetings in April of this year between Brazilian authorities and Chinese executives, aimed at exploring opportunities for partnership and joint technological development.

These conversations also addressed how to reduce production costs and integrate multiple renewable sources using cutting-edge technologies, including hybrid power systems, green hydrogen, green ammonia and large-scale wind turbines.

The new research center, which will be implemented in partnership between Senai Cimatec, a national reference in innovation, and Windey Energy Technology Group, a Chinese state-owned company that is a leader in wind turbines, will focus on the development and maintenance of technologies for large wind turbines, expanding Brazilian expertise in clean energy.

Sustainable aviation fuel: a revolution for the aviation sector

SAF is an innovative alternative to the fossil fuel currently used in commercial aviation.

It is produced from renewable raw materials, with processes that respect strict environmental sustainability criteria.

According to the National Bioenergy Union (UNICA), Brazil has unique conditions to lead the global production of this fuel, thanks to its favorable climate and the variety of natural resources available.

Among the raw materials used are sugar cane, oil palm, macauba, eucalyptus, soy, corn and even agave.

Studies show that the use of SAF can reduce carbon emissions in the aviation sector by up to 80% compared to traditional kerosene, which represents a crucial step towards decarbonizing one of the most challenging sectors in terms of environmental impact.

According to research by Boeing, Brazil has the capacity to produce up to nine billion liters of sustainable fuel per year, which corresponds to 125% of the current fossil fuel consumption of the national aviation sector.

This production would come mainly from agro-industrial waste, such as sugarcane leftovers, eucalyptus residues, residual gases, as well as unusual raw materials such as beef tallow and used cooking oil, increasing the efficiency of the production cycle and contributing to the circular economy.

International panorama and challenges for Brazil

In the global context, the airline industry faces increasing pressure to adopt alternatives that reduce its environmental impact.

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) highlights SAF as one of the most promising technologies to meet carbon neutrality goals by 2050.

However, for Brazil to achieve this leadership, it still needs to face challenges such as technological development, distribution infrastructure and the competitive cost of sustainable fuel in relation to fossil kerosene.

According to experts, recent investments — such as the Chinese contribution — are essential to accelerate these processes, bringing innovation and expanding international cooperation.

Furthermore, the strengthening of public policies, such as the Fuel of the Future Law, offers an important regulatory framework to stimulate the sector and guarantee legal security for investors.

Brazil, therefore, is at the forefront of a transformation that could redefine not only the national energy sector, but also the country's position in the global sustainable aviation scenario.",https://clickpetroleoegas.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-photograph-of-a-modern-passenger-airpl_3IH1ZC90TIqQeFfrQmynqg_3a0QITLLTV6FfdqayOTUFg.jpeg,N,,2025-05-17 15:56:43.269382

The association, in a press release on Thursday, said that travel intermediaries including travel agents and tour operators accounted for 5 million euros’ worth of refund claims that are now part of Air Belgium’s bankruptcy proceedings.

The travel and tour operators’ group, which represents 80,000 travel agents and tour operators in Europe, further added that the bankruptcy incident highlighted travel intermediaries’ exposure to massive losses in case of airline bankruptcies.

Air Belgium’s outstanding passenger refund claims

Air Belgium announced that it would stop all scheduled passenger flights to focus on cargo and aircraft leasing operations in Sept. 2023. After the European airline’s declaration of bankruptcy, the passengers refund claims for its cancelled flights became a part of its bankruptcy proceedings.

In the case of Air Belgium’s cancelled flights that were booked through travel intermediaries, the responsibility to provide alternate travel arrangements fell on these intermediaries. Hence, the travel and tour operators had to provide alternate arrangements to its passengers with no prospect of recovering the original cancellation claims from the Belgian airline insolvency.

The association said that this places an “unfair financial burden” on travel intermediaries, who would have to bear the losses following airline failures as airline tickets need to be paid upfront.

Frank Oostdam, President of ECTAA said:

“The Air Belgium bankruptcy is yet another stark reminder that the current system leaves both consumers and travel intermediaries exposed to unacceptable risks. Airlines must be required to provide financial guarantees to cover their liabilities in case of insolvency.”

The ECTAA emphasised rising airline failures, calling for government support for failing airlines in Europe in terms of travel intermediaries. It further stated that there have been around 1,200 commercial passenger airline failures in the past 25 years.

The Air Passenger Rights Regulation (Regulation 261/2004) revision is currently up for discussion in the Council of the European Union. The association has urged the council to take this moment to consider adding mandatory protection measures that guarantee airline ticket refunds for flight cancellations owing to an airline ceasing operations or going bankrupt.

Air Belgium’s bankruptcy explained

The Belgian airline was established in 2016 for long-haul flights connecting Belgium with Asia.

On Sept. 18, 2023, Air Belgium announced that it would end its scheduled passenger flight service by October 2023 to focus on cargo and aircraft leasing operations. This was in response to mounting losses as the airline had been facing major financial hurdles after the Covid-19 pandemic, including rising fuel costs and geopolitical issues. Air Belgium officially declared bankruptcy on April 30, 2025 after facing major financial struggles that it was unable to cope with despite strategic shifts.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AB-Fleet-A330ceo-250kb-01.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 12:57:46.076169

Global Oil Demand: What the Forecasts Say We found the latest oil demand forecast in the International Energy Forum’s monthly comparative analysis of the oil market report.
It expects global oil demand to grow by 0.7 mb/d in 2025, even though OECD demand may fall by about 120,000 barrels per day.
To simplify it, the gap between the highest and lowest global oil demand forecasts is 0.6 mb/d for 2025 and 0.5 mb/d for 2026.","For decades, oil was the backbone of global transport. It powered nearly every vehicle, pushing oil demand ever higher. Infrastructure significantly grew around extraction, refining, and distribution. But with mounting concerns over emissions and climate change, the search for cleaner alternatives gained momentum. Electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a game changer in this shift.

IEA recently published its Global EV Outlook 2025, where it has predicted,

By 2030, EVs are set to replace more than 5 million barrels of oil per day (mb/d) globally, with China’s expanding EV fleet making up half of that impact.

Let’s deep dive into this report and understand how the rise of EVs is impacting global oil demand.

The Rise of EVs and Its Impact on Global Oil Demand

By the end of 2024, the global electric car fleet reached nearly 58 million, more than triple the number in 2021. These EVs now make up about 4% of the global passenger car fleet.

The trend is strongest in China, where roughly 1 in 10 cars is electric. In Europe, the ratio is 1 in 20, but growing fast.

The UK, the second-largest car market in Europe, saw EVs take nearly 30% of new car sales in 2024. This rise was driven by the new Vehicle Emissions Trading Scheme, which required 22% of new car registrations to be battery electric or hydrogen fuel cell models.

With flexible credit borrowing allowed, manufacturers achieved nearly 20% EV sales. Norway led with near-total electrification. 88% of new cars sold were fully electric, and another 3% were plug-in hybrids.

As a result, Norway’s oil demand from the road fell 12% from 2021 to 2024. Denmark also saw a big jump, with EVs reaching 56% of new car sales in 2024 and nearly 100,000 units sold.

Meanwhile, Denmark is also seeing strong progress. In the latest figures, the share of electric cars jumped by 10 percentage points, reaching 56%, with nearly 100,000 EVs sold.

Oil Demand Drops as EV Fleet Grows Rapidly

Surge in EVs on roads came heavy on the oil industry. IEA says that electric vehicles slashed oil demand by over 1.3 million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2024.

It was a steep 30% jump from 2023, and the present figures are nearly equal to all the oil Japan currently uses for transportation.

Passenger cars and small vans classified as light-duty vehicles (LDVs) drive most of this shift. Today, they account for 80% of the oil displaced by EVs. By 2030, their share will slightly drop to 77% as electric trucks and buses gain traction.

This is because of the rapidly evolving batteries and stronger charging infrastructure, these heavy-duty vehicles will likely displace nearly 1 mb/d of oil within the decade.

EVs Cut Costs and Boost Energy Security

IEA analysts highlighted that even if global oil prices fall to $40 per barrel, EVs remain cost-effective especially with home charging. This way drivers can continue saving money by switching to electric vehicles.

In China, fast public charging costs about twice as much as charging at home. Yet, EVs still offer better fuel savings than gas-powered cars. As more people choose EVs, countries reduce their oil use and become less vulnerable to price shocks. This shift not only saves money but also strengthens national energy security.

Strong Policies Keep EV Adoption on Track

Although trade tensions, slow economic growth, and oil price drops may hurt overall car sales, these issues affect the market size more than the EV share. In China, steady government support and affordable EV prices continue to drive sales forward.

Meanwhile, in Europe, even though EVs cost more than traditional cars, long-term policies and past crisis responses help keep the market moving.

Additionally, Norway planned to raise taxes on traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) cars and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) from April. This was meant to boost EV sales and help the country reach its goal of 100% zero-emission car sales by the end of 2025.

The 2025 EV outlook shows strong momentum. Despite economic uncertainty, EVs continue to grow thanks to smart policies, lower battery costs, and better infrastructure. As countries push for cleaner transportation, EVs are helping the world move toward a more sustainable, low-carbon future.

With over 58 million electric cars already on the road by the end of 2024—and more to come—the transition is well underway. This shift not only transforms the oil market but also puts the world on a clearer, more energy-secure path forward.

Global Oil Demand: What the Forecasts Say

We found the latest oil demand forecast in the International Energy Forum’s monthly comparative analysis of the oil market report. It highlights the following:

OPEC

OPEC expects oil demand to grow by around 1.3 million barrels per day (mb/d) in both 2025 and 2026. Almost all this growth will come from non-OECD countries, where demand is expected to rise by 1.2 mb/d each year. In contrast, OECD countries will see only a small increase of 0.1 mb/d annually.

EIA

The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) recently increased its 2025 forecast by 0.1 mb/d compared to last month. It now expects demand to rise by 1.0 mb/d next year. However, this is 0.4 mb/d lower than the estimate made in January 2025. For 2026, the EIA sees demand rising more slowly, by 0.9 mb/d.

IEA

The IEA has a more cautious view. It expects global oil demand to grow by 0.7 mb/d in 2025, even though OECD demand may fall by about 120,000 barrels per day. For 2026, the IEA sees demand increasing by 0.8 mb/d. According to its latest data, average yearly demand growth between 2022 and 2024 was just 0.3 mb/d.

To simplify it, the gap between the highest and lowest global oil demand forecasts is 0.6 mb/d for 2025 and 0.5 mb/d for 2026. These differences highlight the uncertainty that still surrounds future oil demand.

Furthermore, as electric vehicles gain popularity, governments are starting to feel the financial impact. Fuel taxes, which have been a key source of public funding for roads and transport, are shrinking. In 2022 alone, the global shift to EVs resulted in an estimated $9 billion drop in fuel tax revenues.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2454822329.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 05:56:40.414586

Speaking at the opening ceremony, Chinese President Xi Jinping underlined the start of a new, more united chapter of this relationship; CELAC leaders emphasised the need for a more balanced, multipolar world, and framed the bloc’s partnership with China as a pathway to greater autonomy in global affairs.

Founded in 2010, CELAC is a regional intergovernmental organisation that brings together all the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. The China-CELAC Forum was established in 2014 to promote partnerships between the regions. Each previous China-CELAC summit has produced joint cooperation action plans, covering a variety of areas, from sustainable development to cultural collaborations.

Tuesday’s summit was officially a ministerial meeting, but several national leaders attended: Colombia’s Gustavo Petro, Gabriel Boric of Chile, and Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva all travelled to Beijing for the opening ceremony.

Recommended

President Xi’s speech included the announcement of a CNY 66 billion (USD 9.15 billion) credit line to support development in CELAC countries. This figure is slightly less than half that pledged at the 2015 summit.

“Although China and the LAC [Latin America and Caribbean] region are geographically distant, the bonds of our friendship stretch back through centuries,” Xi said. “Together, China and LAC countries champion true multilateralism, uphold international fairness and justice, advance global governance reform, and promote global multipolarity and greater democracy in international relations.”

Xi added that China and Latin America should expand cooperation on clean energy, artificial intelligence and the digital economy. He said that China will increase imports of “quality products” from Latin America, and that Chinese companies will be encouraged to expand investment in the region.

Chile’s Boric concurred, claiming this as the time “to take a qualitative leap forward in economic ties with China”. Petro – whose country Colombia is currently assuming CELAC’s rotating presidency – proposed a fibre optic cable to connect Asia with Latin America. Brazil’s Lula advocated for strong trade with China and deeper cooperation on the energy transition. He also defended multilateralism: “Chinese support is crucial to getting highways, railways, ports and transmission lines off the ground.”

In a 28-point joint statement issued late on Tuesday, the China-CELAC Forum underlined its commitment to multilateralism and international cooperation, and to “strengthening all pillars of the climate change mechanism”.

A summit amid a trade war

The China-CELAC summit took place amid a cooling in the tariff war between the United States and China. On Monday, the two countries agreed to a rollback on the trading terms and reciprocal tariff hikes that had been escalating in severity since January. On Tuesday, the US dropped its tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China signed off on a reduction from 125% to 10%. However, this will be reviewed in 90 days.

This trade conflict has placed Latin America in a challenging position. While US President Donald Trump has close allies in the region, such as Argentina’s President Javier Milei and El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele, others in Latin America have sought to diversify their partners. For example, on Monday, Petro confirmed Colombia’s joining of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

The BRI has expanded in the region over the past decade, and Colombia will become the 23rd CELAC country to sign up.

Dialogue Earth consulted Francisco Urdinez, who directs the Millennium Nucleus on the Impacts of China in Latin America, an interdisciplinary research initiative. He says the summit’s main goal was to “show the world that multilateralism still exists and that free trade is still possible”.

Rebecca Ray, senior academic researcher for the Boston University Global Development Policy Center, agrees: “With trade barriers all over the place, it’s an important moment to come together and reaffirm commitment to multilateralism. The region is committing to pragmatic, open, non-discriminatory relations with the world to achieve its goals.”

Further investments

For Parsifal D’Sola Alvarado, executive director of the Andrés Bello Foundation (FAB)’s Latin American Chinese Research Center, the most important parts of the summit were the bilateral interactions that the leaders of Brazil, Colombia and Chile each had with China. “The rest was just statements from the governments and a lack of definitions,” Alvarado adds.

Companies from China, Brazil’s primary trading partner, expressed their intention to invest approximately USD 4.5 billion in various sectors of the Brazilian economy.

According to the Brazilian Trade and Investment Promotion Agency (ApexBrasil), that will include renewable energy, mining, automobiles, food, logistics and the health sector.

Brazil also issued a joint statement with China on the margins of the summit, in which both countries agreed to cooperate on projects related to the environment, energy transition and science and technology, among other areas.

Brazil has so far chosen not to join the BRI. But the country still desires closer ties with China, says political scientist and international relations professor Maurício Santoro: “In recent years, we have seen a diversification of Chinese investments in Brazil, such as in the electric vehicle sector. Major car manufacturers such as BYD are building factories in the country.”

The Chile-China Business Forum also took place in Beijing this week, organised by the Boric administration. At the forum, the Chilean president lauded multilateralism and free trade, and the reciprocal benefits they bring. Both countries indicated willingness to collaborate on solutions to challenges facing the energy transition and the digital transformation, among other issues.

Meanwhile, Nicaragua, which resumed diplomatic relations with China in 2021, signed four agreements with Chinese companies on the margins of the summit, including a deal with Yutong on electric vehicles. Hydroelectric and mining deals were also floated.

Margaret Myers, managing director of the Johns Hopkins University’s Institute for America, China and the Future of Global Affairs, notes China’s lower credit commitment compared to previous summits. But she says it remains significant given the US’ withdrawal of certain forms of assistance, such as USAID, and the slow progress of Europe’s Global Gateway programme.

“Whether China’s billions materialise or not will depend on multiple factors,” says Myers, “including China’s own economic prospects, the extent to which bankable projects are available to Chinese companies, and the interests of individual countries and localities. But China seems committed to continued engagement with the region.”",https://dialogue.earth/content/uploads/2025/05/CELAC-China-ministerial-summit-in-Beijing_Juan-Diego-Cano_Presidencia-de-la-Republica-de-Colombia_f6e04c1b39-1200px-copy.jpeg,N,,2025-05-17 05:56:44.922858

A multi-billion-dollar engine and services agreement between GE Aerospace GE and Qatar Airways marks one of the aviation giant's largest widebody aircraft commitments to date.

It arrives at a pivotal moment for GE Aerospace, which has been newly streamlined as a standalone company and is intensely focused on the future of flight.

The implications are wide-reaching, offering a significant tailwind to its operations, financial trajectory, and long-term value proposition for shareholders.

The Nuts and Bolts of GE’s Deal

At the heart of the agreement with Qatar Airways is a substantial order for more than 400 of GE Aerospace's advanced jet engines.

This includes a commitment for 60 GE9X engines, the exclusive powerplant for Boeing's new 777-9 aircraft, and 260 GEnx engines, a popular choice for Boeing's 787 Dreamliner family. The order also encompasses options for additional units and a comprehensive inventory of spares.

Next-Generation Thrust: The GE9X and GEnx Advantage

The GE9X is the world’s most powerful commercial aircraft engine, delivering 10% better fuel efficiency than its predecessor, the GE90-115B. The GEnx engine family has logged over 62 million flight hours and powers about two-thirds of all Boeing 787s in operation.

Both platforms are certified to run on 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blends—supporting aviation decarbonization goals and giving GE a clear advantage in a rapidly evolving aerospace landscape.

Why Services Are a Game-Changer for GE Stock

While the hardware grabs headlines, the real long-term value lies in the agreement’s extensive Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) contracts. These multi-decade service agreements generate higher profit margins than initial engine sales and offer recurring revenue for decades.

For GE Aerospace stockholders, this de-risks future cash flow and supports a more predictable earnings model over the life of the engines.

How GE's Focus and Strength Secured the Qatar Win

GE Aerospace’s success in landing a deal of this magnitude is no accident. It follows the strategic spin-offs of GE HealthCare GEHC and GE Vernova GEV, which left the company wholly dedicated to aviation. Under the leadership of Chairman and CEO H. Lawrence Culp Jr., GE has sharpened its focus, allowing for more deliberate capital allocation and strategic execution.

In Q1 2025, GE Aerospace posted strong financials: $12.3 billion in total orders (up 12% YoY), $9.0 billion in adjusted revenue (up 11%), and a 60% jump in adjusted EPS to $1.49. The company ended the quarter with a sizable Remaining Performance Obligation (RPO) of $172.6 billion, providing high visibility into future revenue streams.

From Order to Earnings

The Qatar Airways agreement adds significantly to GE’s already industry-leading commercial engine backlog. Within the Commercial Engines & Services (CES) segment alone, RPO stood at $153.8 billion as of March 31, 2025. The deal contributes to future revenue not just through engine deliveries but through its high-value service contracts that will span decades.

It also supports GE's 2025 outlook, which includes low-double-digit adjusted revenue growth and operating profit guidance between $7.8 billion and $8.2 billion. Notably, CES services revenue rose 17% in Q1, a momentum the Qatar deal is expected to sustain.

The Qatar Deal Is A Strategic Win

Qatar Airways’ decision to go with GE9X and GEnx engines is a resounding endorsement of GE Aerospace’s technological innovation and operational reliability. It’s also a meaningful win in a competitive global market where Rolls-Royce RYCEF is a key rival.

Industry analysts view the agreement as a significant competitive victory and a strong signal of GE’s dominant position in the widebody engine space.

From Factory Floor to Flight Line

Fulfilling an order of this scale necessitates sustained and potentially increased production rates for the GE9X and GEnx engine lines. This operational demand aligns with GE Aerospace's recently announced plans to invest nearly $1 billion in its U.S. manufacturing facilities and technology throughout 2025.

This investment strategy, which includes hiring approximately 5,000 new employees, is geared towards enhancing production capacity, improving capabilities, and supporting the entire lifecycle of its commercial and military engines, directly enabling the execution of significant commitments such as the Qatar deal.

What the Qatar Deal Signals for GE’s Stockholders [content-module:MarketRank|NYSE:GE]

For investors, the Qatar Airways agreement reinforces GE Aerospace’s strategy as a focused aviation leader. It brings improved earnings predictability, a critical asset in the cyclical aerospace sector.

The cash flow from this agreement backs the company’s capital return program, including its $0.28 quarterly dividend (targeting 30% growth in 2025) and a $15 billion share repurchase program. In Q1 2025 alone, GE repurchased $1.9 billion in stock, with plans to reach $7 billion for the full year.

Mega-deals like this one tend to lift analyst sentiment and market confidence by reducing uncertainty and highlighting the company’s competitive edge. Investors will closely track metrics such as RPO growth, services revenue, and segment margins to evaluate execution.

GE Aerospace: Powered by Partnership

This landmark agreement with Qatar Airways is more than a sales milestone—it’s a defining moment. It underscores GE Aerospace’s technological edge, competitive strength, and the long-term value of its integrated engine-and-services model.

As a standalone company, GE is demonstrating its ability to deliver large-scale, high-impact solutions that create lasting value for customers and shareholders alike.

From 2026 onward, the company will have up to 500,000 mt/year of SAF production.","Calls from some producers to limit Asian imports of sustainable aviation fuel to Europe are unlikely to come to anything, as the Continent needs more product, an official at biofuels producer EcoCeres said in an interview.

TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanee called on EU regulators in January at the World Economic Forum to support premium prices for Europe's low-carbon fuels market, or risk offshoring its transitioning refining sector to growing producers such as China.

However, this call for policy protection from regulators for European SAF production might fall on deaf ears. ""I don't believe it will happen simply because Europe is short,"" Phillip Moore, global head of SAF at EcoCeres, told Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, in an interview on the sidelines of the International Air Transport Association's Aviation Energy Forum in Baku.

""There's not the capacity to supply from here and there is a genuine need, so why would you want to have antidumping?,"" he said.

Biofuels have felt pressure from Asian imports more widely. Chinese import competition was widely blamed for a slump in biodiesel prices in 2024 that left many suppliers struggling to break even and saw large-scale projects paused. In August, the EU imposed tariffs on Chinese biodiesel to support European projects, but exempted SAF from the measures.

The market for biofuels is struggling amid oversupply, but toughening mandates boost the longer-term outlook, management at Dutch storage firm Royal Vopak and Austrian refinery OMV said in summer 2024.

Platts assessed SAF on a CIF basis in Northwest Europe at $1,774/mt over jet cargoes May 14, a premium of 158% and down from 203% when the SAF assessment was launched in September 2023.

Looking ahead, EU mandates will raise demand and Europe could fall short on supplies, with prices rising accordingly, according to analysts.

New capacity

EcoCeres has a 350,000 mt/year biofuels plant in Jiangsu, China. The company is about to complete a second plant in Johor, Malaysia, with a capacity of 420,000 mt/year. From 2026 onward, the company will have up to 500,000 mt/year of SAF production.

""Most of our market is in Europe, and we are selling to obligated parties and also to airlines,"" Moore said.

Feedstock is waste-based and mostly used cooking oil. With the startup of its Malaysian plant, the company will also be looking at some other feedstocks, soap stock, soybean oil, animal fats from Australia and New Zealand, and fish oil fats from Vietnam.

EcoCeres is considering another hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids pathway plant in Southeast Asia and FID will be taken either later in 2026 or early in 2026.

The company also produces hydrotreated vegetable oils and cellulosic ethanol.

There is growing interest in bringing product produced in Asia to Europe across the industry. TotalEnergies and China's Sinopec will jointly develop and own a 230,000 mt/year sustainable aviation fuel production unit at a Sinopec refinery in China, the companies said in March. It is eyeing potential export routes to Europe.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-17 05:56:52.901254

TIAC’s message highlights the vital economic role tourism plays from coast to coast, noting that the industry supports over two million Canadian jobs and generates more than $130 billion in economic activity. The association warns that recent declines in American visitors – Canada’s largest inbound market – are threatening the viability of many tourism operators across the country.

In the letter, TIAC outlines a series of policy recommendations aimed at stabilizing and growing the industry, from boosting international marketing efforts to improving visa processing and investing in sustainable tourism infrastructure. The letter appears in full below:

Dear Prime Minister Carney:

As you lead Canada into this next chapter, it is essential to recognize the critical role that Canada’s tourism sector plays in shaping both our economy and our national identity. Tourism is a significant contributor to the economy, cultural exchange and international goodwill. Tourism is at the heart of political ridings from coast to coast to coast – from our bustling urban centres to our country’s beautiful rural landscapes and seascapes.

Canada’s travel and tourism sector represents over 243,000 businesses and over 2 million households who rely on tourism, conferences, events, and travel for their livelihoods. This sector is crucial in every single electoral district in Canada. In 2024, tourism generated $130 billon in economic activity. With over $32 billion of annual spending coming from international visitors, tourism is also our country’s third largest export industry representing over 14 percent of Canada’s total service export revenue.

Though the tourism sector demonstrated remarkable resilience after being the hardest hit during the global pandemic, it is now facing a real and similar crisis. More than ever, the sector requires the support of our government and political leaders.

While the on-going trade tensions between the United States and Canada threatens to increase business operating costs economy-wide, unlike many other sectors, the success of Canadian tourism is also deeply tied to the influx of travelers from the U.S. Whether they’re visiting for family vacations, exploring our stunning national parks, discovering cultural and historical landmarks, embarking on whale-watching adventures, or attending international conferences and events, American visitors represent a crucial demographic for the industry. They represent the largest inbound market for many destinations, attractions, as well as transportation and accommodation businesses across the country.

Statistics Canada reports significant declines in cross-border visitors in February, March, and April 2025 when compared to the same month in previous years, underscoring the immediate impact of global trade uncertainty on Canada’s tourism sector.1 A recent poll conducted by TIAC finds that half (47%) of tourism businesses and organizations have supply chains that are reliant on products from the U.S. and 70% of tourism organizations rely heavily on U.S. travellers. The rapid drop in American visitors in a number of markets is already threatening the viability of operators across the country and putting at risk the livelihoods of the more than 2 million Canadians employed in the sector – a prolonged reduction of U.S. visitors could have detrimental effects.

Understanding the crucial roles that travel and tourism play in shaping Canada’s economic future, we are calling on you to take immediate action in supporting policies and investments that will stabilize and fuel the growth of this essential sector.

Fortify Canada’s international marketing capacity through meaningful investments in Destination Canada to attract more international visitors from other parts of the world;

Expedite visitor entry into Canada by expanding programs like the Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA), reducing processing times for visitor visas, and digitizing screening and clearance procedures;

Strengthen the tourism workforce by supporting the integration of underemployed Canadians—including youth, asylum seekers, newcomers, and underrepresented groups –into rewarding tourism careers;

Incentivize business investment aimed at renewing our country’s tourism infrastructure and assets, and developing innovative tourism ventures across the country;

Develop a national, multi-modal transportation strategy that expands connectivity, enhances rural/urban connections, and improves traveller access to and throughout Canada.

Invigorate Canada’s business events sector through expanded support for the International Convention Attraction Fund (ICAF); and,

Support sustainability for Canadian travel and transportation industries by investing in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and alternative green power solutions.

These recommendations can help secure the future of tourism in Canada – fueling job creation, strengthening local economies, and making Canada a top destination worldwide. According to the BDC, a mere 10% increase in tourism spending could boost Canada’s GDP by a full 1% – a powerful return on investment that fortifies thousands of businesses and creates sustainable employment for generations to come.

We hope you will take this opportunity to champion a sector that touches every corner of the country.",https://www.travelweek.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AdobeStock_241046455-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-05-17 05:56:57.436035

Senate Bills 235-36, introduced by Sens. Sam Singh (D-East Lansing) and Joe Bellino (R-Monroe), and House Bills 4424-25, introduced by Rep. Jerry Neyer, (R-Shepherd), would establish a $1.50 (€1.30) per gallon tax credit for the purchase, production, or blending of SAF starting in 2026.

The credit increases to $2 (€1.80) per gallon for fuels that deliver greater reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The SAF will then be used for flights that depart from Michigan.

“This bipartisan plan will make aviation fuel more accessible and affordable and will help us realise the global vision we spelled out in our landmark Clean Energy Future plan,” Sen. Singh said.

“Decarbonising the aviation sector will not be easy, but we have to start somewhere. Working collaboratively with our farmers and producers will simultaneously reduce carbon emissions in our atmosphere and support our Michigan economy. By tackling this monumental task, we continue to prove that Michigan is a global leader in protecting our environment.”

Rep. Neyer, chair of the House Agriculture Committee, said: “Whether we like it or not, things are changing in Michigan.

“New clean energy standards are quickly approaching, and pending policy changes from the feds have left corn and soybean farmers with a ‘let’s wait and see’ mentality. And who can blame them? By incentivising the private sector to produce and blend SAF here in Michigan, we can encourage cleaner skies and boost the agriculture industry at the same time.”

By encouraging the use of Michigan-grown feedstocks such as corn and soybeans, the legislation is poised to open new markets for farmers, helping revitalize rural economies and reinforcing the vital connection between agriculture and energy innovation.",https://www.gleaf.in/uploads//blogs/a5f34e2564153183f4c5c09e6fca023d.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 02:56:32.572325

S.A.F., Jones said, is a minimum 80 percent reduction compared with Jet-A fuel: “For sustainability, those are massive numbers.”","Formula 1 visits 24 locations annually, across 21 countries, and its equipment needs to be present. It is a gargantuan operation.

“I’ve been here 39 years, we used to do 16 races, five international, now it’s 15 international and nine Europeans,” Paul Fowler, vice president of motorsport product for DHL Motorsport, Formula 1’s longtime logistics partner, said in an interview. “It was two DC-10s in the day, the 747 freighter just about existed — now it’s up to nine flights per race — and the calendar was spread. Now you’re doing checkered flag down on a Sunday, Monday we’re at the next race.”

Equipment is split among air, sea and road freight. For European events most equipment travels by road, and for the remainder — colloquially called flyaways — essential items are flown on up to nine 777 jets, including the cars. Nonessential equipment is shipped by sea. There are extreme examples, like knives and forks.

“Cutlery is sponsor-specific for teams, so you can’t just take whatever, and you can’t locally source it,” Fowler said.

The grueling schedule means every movement is carefully coordinated.

“The first plane takes 30 pallets, so each team gets three pallets as their priority freight,” said Simon Price, event manager for DHL Motorsport. “That will normally go just over 12 hours after the flag, but it depends where we’re going.

“After Las Vegas, the next race is the next week in Qatar. We’re changing continents and time zones, we have an 18-hour flight, but there’s also a deficit of 11 hours [time zone change], so we lose over 24 hours, just a liftoff, and that’s before we set up — and everything still has to be done. The schedules are so tight, this industry and what we’re working in now, everything is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible — and that also extends to logistics.”

The logistics team must monitor costs and consider restrictions on Russia’s airspace. Avoiding the Suez Canal because of military action there has lengthened journeys. And the team must be prepared if seaports are congested. Smooth relationships and experience with customs personnel are also essential, especially in countries where signoffs take longer.

“We do have a Plan A, B and C, and we do joke that we never want to get to P, Q and R, which is Panic, Quit and Run!” Fowler said.

Such contingencies mean Formula 1 has rarely has had any problems, even with issues in recent years, including a storm in the Gulf of Mexico, two planes having technical problems between Grands Prix in Australia and China, and the collapse of part of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore affecting shipping lanes.

“Teams will never be without anything,” Price said. “Our deadlines are not like commercial deadlines where if you can’t deliver it on Friday you could deliver it on Monday morning — that doesn’t work here because the race is on Sunday. It has to be here.”

Price recalled an engine manufacturer requiring the urgent deployment of a repaired component to the track during a race weekend.

“This was on Friday afternoon; we were in Italy,” Price said. “We booked a flight for one of our guys, he flew to the U.K., had a van to take him to the factory. There were no flights available to return, so we had to get a private jet, but the only one we could get was in Nice,” in France.

They flew the jet to Luton Airport, near London, but “Luton takeoff rights wouldn’t allow the plane to take off overnight, so we had to move the plane to Birmingham.” He said they then flew to the Malpensa airport near Milan, with a man carrying the part in a suitcase.

“We had a car waiting for him there and took him straight to the circuit,” Price said. “That’s Friday 4 p.m. to Saturday lunchtime.”

The Imola track in Italy this weekend hosts the first European round, the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, so road transport takes over. But there are events across the next two weekends, in Monaco and Spain, bringing further complications. Three Grands Prix in successive weekends used to be rare, but they are now commonplace.

“In the old days we could never do back-to-backs, as everything was built around single events,” Ian Stone, Formula 1’s director of transport logistics and cargo, said in an interview. “Now we have two sets of key infrastructure: the E.T.C. [Event Technology Center], cabling, fiber optic network, the pit lane garage network, and we leapfrog with an A and B team.

“For Imola, one team went out last Thursday [May 8], starting the setup. They’ll stay until after the race, while the other team will be in Monaco, then the Imola team will go straight to Spain. There’s some expensive kit that you don’t have multiple versions of, so we have priority trucks that will be on the road by midnight to get there Monday lunchtime. Our deadline is to be ready to do a full system test with the F.I.A. at 2 p.m. on Thursday, and that’s an immovable object.”

Despite the quantity of equipment — which Formula 1 estimates is about 1,200 tons per race and likely to grow in 2026 with Cadillac’s arrival — and the expanded schedule, championship officials say they are managing to arrange logistics in line with their sustainability and Net Zero 2030 ambitions. Instead of the trucks burning gasoline or standard diesel fuel, they are using Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or S.A.F., and biofuels.

“When you look at the biofuels in our trucks, which power our European season, that’s over an 80 percent reduction in our carbon footprint compared to standard fuel,” said Ellen Jones, Formula 1’s head of environment, social and governance. S.A.F., Jones said, is a minimum 80 percent reduction compared with Jet-A fuel: “For sustainability, those are massive numbers.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/17/multimedia/17sp-emilia-logistics-inyt-pfvm/17sp-emilia-logistics-inyt-pfvm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 22:56:24.049145

Eric Sfiligoj: Hello, welcome to another edition of CropLife Retail Week. I’m Eric Sfiligoj, editor of CropLife and CropLife Iron, here again with Lara Sowinski. Lara, how you doing?

Lara Sowinski: Doing great. Thank you. How are you?

ES: I am doing good. And hey, we’ve got some good news to share with our viewers this week. You know, and um my first item, this has to do with our favorite herbicide, glyphosate. As you know, of course, we’ve talked about many times over the years, there have numerous lawsuits regarding that popular herbicide and its producer Bayer.

A lot of them are at the state level involving state labeling laws versus federal labeling laws. And I know we talked a couple of weeks ago about how the fact that The state of North Dakota became the first state to actually have its legal body pass legislation that said a federal labeling laws are enough of a warning. State labeling laws don’t need to be over and above that.

And we found out this week on May 12th that Governor. Brian Kemp of Georgia signed SB144. And that bill does the same thing as the North Dakota bill. It actually affirms that EPA regulations and warning labels on pesticides are enough of a warning, and that that supersedes any state warnings that would have normally been required in this instance. So I know that several folks in the industry, farmers and agricultural groups, were applauding this move.

They’re hoping that this will add some clarity to the whole question of what’s going on with glyphosate. and maybe hope fully help it when it comes to some of these state level lawsuits that have hurt the brand so badly.

LS: I think um that was um expected that that would go through. I’m curious what states are next and how this, I remember when you were talking about this a few weeks ago, there were a handful of states that were considering similar legislation. So yeah, it’ll be interesting to see how this continues to unfold.

ES: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And those other states, I know Missouri in particular, of course, it makes sense. That’s as so located here in the States. um They have a bill that’s, you know, I guess it’s made it through one part of their of their, I think the House has passed the bill. The Senate’s looking at it now. And I believe Iowa was also considering a similar bill. But again, we’ve got two states now on board. So hopefully more will begin to fall on the line. We will see.

So, yeah, so one other item on glyphosate, since we’re talking about that, you may remember a couple of videos ago, we talked about the fact that our friends at Bayer had actually petitioned the Supreme Court to kind of weigh in on this whole question about federal labels versus state labels.

And we found out this week that several groups, farmers and agricultural organizations have also filed a brief on behalf of the industry encouraging the U.S. Supreme Court to indeed take up this issue. Among the groups that have filed are the American Farm Bureau Federation, the American Soybean Association, the National Association of Wheat Growers, the National Corn Growers Association, and your friends at the National Cotton Council.

So hopefully, no word yet on whether or not the Supreme Court will actually take up this case, but they are considering the petition at this point.

LS: That’s great.

ES: So we will see what happens next.

LS: Yeah, that’s great. Good news, Eric. Thank you.

ES: Well, Laura, that was the news I have to share this week. And I guess you said you have a couple of items as well. So take it away.

LS: I do, thank you. i have a press release some dated May 13th from the Iowa Corn Growers Association. And this one caught my attention. I was a little bit surprised. um The press release states that the Iowa Senate passed the anti-pipeline bill, this is House File 639, with a vote of 27 to 22, effectively banning carbon capture and sequestration CCS projects within Iowa, including those that could achieve 100% voluntary easement.

Stu Swanson, Iowa have a Corn Growers Association president and farmer from Galt, Iowa, released the following statement. Quote, this is a hit to Iowa corn growers and ethanol producers. The decision to ban carbon capture and sequestration projects cuts off our ability to tap into markets for ultra low carbon ethanol and puts Iowa a corn growers at a disadvantage compared to states pursuing CCS projects.

Iowa has long been known as the corn state, and this decision impacts our ability to stay competitive as other states and countries seize this new opportunity.

Our farmers deserve increased market access, not increased barriers. Iowa Corn Growers Association is disheartened, by this decision, but appreciates the support of Senate members who voted in the interest of the Iowa farmer.

And just a quick little backgrounder, production of corn continues to outpace demand. USDA is estimating we will have 1.8 billion bushels of excess corn at the end of the twenty five twenty six crop year. If this bill is signed by the governor, it would destroy the opportunity to pursue massive new ethanol markets like sustainable aviation fuel. Worldwide jet fuel demand is projected to be at 120 billion gallons by 2035.

If just 10% of that market could be made into sustainable aviation fuel from ethanol, this would equate to nearly 19 billion gallons of new ethanol demand or nearly 6.5 billion bushels of new corn demand.

That is more than 1.5 times the amount of corn grown in Iowa today. So, um yeah, I was kind of surprised. We’ll see how this plays out. But surprisingly, I did read this past week as well um on the sustainable aviation fuel sector and just how much growth is estimated for that that market. It’s i astounding just how much growth.

So we’ll see what happens with that.

I also have some good news as well. This one is from CoBank. U.S. food and ag exports to Mexico have surged 65% over the past four years, making it the fastest growing export market for a host of American agricultural commodities and products. Mexico’s growth as a destination for US exports has been spurred by the country’s booming post-COVID-19 economy in a rapidly growing manufacturing sector.

So this new research from CoBank, um says that exports, in particular since 2020, from U.S. exports to Mexico have risen from 11.2% to 16.4%. On a volume basis, corn, pork, dairy products, soybeans, and poultry products make up the top five U.S. commodities purchased by Mexico.

So it looks like they are perhaps on… Let’s see, and well, let me say in 2024, US food and ag exports to Mexico climbed to 31.4 billion, slightly below Canada, the top market at 32.4 billion.

So yeah, um Canada is like, or excuse me, Mexico is likely to surpass Canada as our top ag export market. And actually um coincidentally, Peter Zion, um geopolitical strategist, who is the keynote speaker at the ARA conference, not last year, but I think the year prior. I’ve been following him for years. He’s fantastic. He happened to ah release a little video clip this past week and a half or so ago, talking about how China, as an export market for ag um exports is really not going to, it you know, the tariffs and the threat of tariffs up, down, we have tariffs, we don’t, they’re 145%, they’re not, have really kind of, it was essentially the nail in the coffin.

It’s been, you know, the slower population growth, ah other factor factors have been weighing on China as our export market, not to mention competition from Brazil um as an export market for ag. So he was saying that China is not, it’s going to continue to decline as far as an export, a buyer of exports of ag goods from the US. So

Thankfully, I think we do have, um barring some kind of disruption with our Mexico-Canada agreement, you know, thankfully we do have two very strong export markets in Canada and Mexico both. But yeah, so that’s some good news there.

ES: Yeah. And that doesn’t surprise me because like you said, when Peter was the keynote at ARA a couple years ago, I remember even at the book he had that he was sort used as the basis for his speech, he mentioned the fact that he saw the US-Mexico partnership moving forward over the next 10 years as becoming increasingly important and beneficial to both countries.

So it doesn’t surprise me that some of this, you know, some of his predictions from then are now still coming to pass.

LS: Exactly. So, yeah, and I do have that signed copy. copy I was… it able to track Peter down when he was um running around the expo floor.

The end of the world is just the beginning. That’s the title of his latest book, I believe that was, and he signed it. So yeah, he’s great. if If you all don’t know about him, Peter Zion, Z-E-I-H-A-N.

He’s got a free new newsletter that’s just great. lot of good insights, and he frequently talks about ag.",https://www.croplife.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Retail-Week-new.00_00_58_16.Feature.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 02:56:37.597989

In an open letter to Rachel Reeves, manufacturers and climate groups such as UK Steel, the Chemical Industries Association, Green Alliance and E3G have urged the government to move policy costs off electricity prices and into general taxation.

The signatories represent a range of organisations across the industrial supply chain, including manufacturers, infrastructure investors, trade bodies, engineers, consultants and climate organisations.

They argue that without urgent action on lowering electricity prices, which are among the highest in Europe, it will have vast economic impacts, as well as hindering the UK’s net zero transition.

Last year UK Steel highlighted how the UK steel industry had been crippled by “high industrial electricity prices” , with domestic steel producers paying as much as 50% more than competitors in France and Germany.

The letter states that “shifting policy costs to general taxation is an effective, near-term way to reduce power prices, and recover policy costs progressively”.

Energy UK estimates this would cut business electricity prices by up to £40/MWh, lowering bills by 15%, as well as reducing household electricity bills by up to £370 a year.

Additionally, the letter also calls on government to provide “targeted support for the electrification of industry”.

The letter draws comparisons with countries where governments have put such support in place. For instance, Germany removed the ‘green power surcharge’ from electricity bills, funding renewables through a national climate fund instead.

The signatories argue that these measures aren’t just about saving existing industry, it's about seizing a global clean manufacturing market set to be worth $2.6tn by 2030.

The letter concludes: “At this critical juncture, the government must act to reshape the UK’s industrial future, making sure power prices support rather than prevent investment in electrification and enable the UK to become one of the best places in the world to build clean and competitive industry.”

The incidents involved luggage handlers who fell from televators—specialized loading equipment used to move baggage into aircraft—highlighting major safety failings at one of the world’s busiest airports.

Two Near-Identical Accidents at Heathrow

The accidents occurred in 2022 and 2023, resulting in severe injuries for two British Airways employees. In August 2022, Ravinder Teji fell nearly 1.5 meters while working on a short-haul flight. He suffered back injuries and cuts to his head. Just seven months later, in March 2023, Shahjahan Malik fell three meters while unloading luggage from a flight arriving from Seattle. His injuries included a brain bleed, facial fractures, and long-term neurological symptoms.

Both men were operating televators that lacked proper protective features such as guardrails. The absence of these safety measures led to what Southwark Crown Court described as high culpability on the part of the airline. Judge Brendan Finucane KC stated that the injuries suffered were devastating and that proper safeguards could have prevented them.

Breakdown of the Court Decision

Following a prosecution by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), British Airways pleaded guilty to two breaches of safety regulations. The court levied a fine of £3,208,333 and ordered the airline to pay an additional £20,935 in legal costs.

IncidentEmployeeDateFall HeightInjuriesShort-haul flight loadingRavinder TejiAugust 20221.5 metersBack injury, head woundSeattle flight unloadingShahjahan MalikMarch 20233 metersBrain bleed, multiple fractures

Judge Finucane described Mr. Malik’s recovery as long and painful, noting that his jaw had to be sewn shut, requiring a liquid diet for months. He continues to suffer from headaches and chronic pain as a result of the fall.

Health and Safety Executive Responds

After the sentencing, HSE enforcement lawyer Rebecca Schwartz emphasized the avoidable nature of the incidents. She stated that both workers were “fortunate to be alive” and that installing proper guardrails would have significantly reduced the risk of harm.

“The risks of working at height and the necessary control measures are well established,” she added, highlighting that British Airways failed to implement basic safety protocols.

British Airways’ Reaction and Aftermath

In court, British Airways expressed “deep regret” over the incidents. James Leonard KC, representing the airline, stated that both employees had returned to work in modified roles and that BA had made every effort to support their rehabilitation and adapt the workplace.

In a public statement, a BA spokesperson reiterated the company’s commitment to safety: “Safety is always our highest priority, and we deeply regret that despite the measures we had in place, these incidents occurred.”

While British Airways has since implemented additional safety controls, the court’s ruling sends a clear message about employer responsibility in high-risk environments like airports.

Workplace Safety Under Global Scrutiny

The case underscores the ongoing challenge of maintaining safety standards in fast-paced travel hubs like Heathrow. With thousands of ground crew members working daily to ensure flight operations run smoothly, even minor lapses in equipment safety can have life-changing consequences.

This case may prompt other airlines and ground service providers to reassess their protocols, especially for tasks that involve working at height or operating specialized machinery.",https://ftnnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/british-airways-planes-at-airport.webp,N,,2025-05-17 05:57:02.806251

(The Next Web) Metafuels aims to decarbonise jet fuel using 'aerobrew' -- Swiss tech startup Metafuels has unveiled plans to open its first commercial-scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant in the Port of Rotterdam.

Metafuels’ CEO Saurabh Kapoor told TNW that Turbe represents a “major step forward” toward ramping up SAF production. The startup also announced plans to build a similar facility in Denmark last year.

...

The facility, dubbed Turbe, will be built in collaboration with liquid energy storage provider Evos. Turbe will be integrated into Evos’ existing Rotterdam terminal, which offers access to the infrastructure needed to store green methanol in large quantities.

...

Metafuels’ “aerobrew” technology converts renewable methanol into jet fuel, using a process it claims delivers high energy efficiency and up to 90% lower life cycle emissions than conventional jet fuel. The resulting SAF is “drop-in ready,” requiring no changes to aircraft or airport infrastructure.

Turbe will be able to process both bio-methanol — sourced from biological waste — and e-methanol, which is made using renewable electricity and captured CO2. This flexibility allows Metafuels to respond to shifts in feedstock availability and regulatory demand, the company said.

Kapoor said he expects both the Netherlands and Denmark plants to start producing fuel for use in commercial aircraft from 2028. However, before that happens, the company will need to obtain accreditation for its aerobrew process, which it expects to get by the end of this year. READ MORE

After a decade of supporting mobility innovation, the Advanced Propulsion Centre UK (APC) and Zenzic have worked with hundreds of start-ups and SMEs, helping them take their innovation from concept to commercialisation. We’ve seen the breakthroughs and the breakdowns – the big deals and the cautionary tales. Here, Joshua Denne, Head of Product at APC, and Mark Cracknell, Programme Director for Zenzic, reflect on the top ten lessons that separate the companies that accelerate from those that stall.

The mobility sector is brutal. We are heavy on hardware, and unlike software, you can’t pivot on a whim. The product lifecycle is longer, the capital burn is higher, the asset requirement is intense, and proving technical viability is only half the battle. Commercial traction is what defines winners.

We launched the next evolution of our mobility start-up accelerator ‘Mobilise’ in January 2025. These ten hard-won lessons from the past decade have shaped how we hope to support the next generation of mobility start-ups.

1. The right support at the right stage

The UK’s mobility ecosystem is rich in its diversity: we have global corporate OEMs and suppliers, established supply businesses, small-and-steady SMEs, high-ambition scaleups, and bleeding-edge start-ups. Taking a single approach to supporting each of these segments does not deliver the best outcomes. A start-up taking its core technology to Minimum Viable Product (MVP) needs fundamentally different help than one scaling manufacturing capacity. A global OEM does not need the same intervention as an established UK-based supplier. Our focus in this article is on start-ups and the programmes we have developed to accelerate them.

For start-ups at the seed stage, funding for technology validation is immediately critical and an entrepreneur’s first priority. However, due to long product introduction periods, the high cost of development, and the challenging commercial environment, commercialisation expertise, IP strategy, and Investment readiness also need to be an early priority – support with the target market, and help preparing for relevant early-adopter market requirements are absolutely critical.

Mismatched support can leave a lot of value on the table. We’ve seen companies attempt to deliver large application readiness programmes before they’ve validated their technology, only to burn through cash with limited traction. Likewise, we have seen many start-ups waste time and resources shooting for an unrealistic market segment. The right support at the right stage accelerates, but the wrong support at the wrong time can be a distraction.

Mobilise is a structured early-stage accelerator programme that supports ambitious start-ups, university spinouts, or pivoting SMEs that are developing innovative mobility-related early-stage, zero-emission or Connected and Automated Mobility (CAM) technologies, products, services, or solutions to accelerate the transition to a safer, smarter, more sustainable future.

2. Early adopters beat ‘build it and they will come’

Proof of traction trumps proof of concept. It’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that superior tech will automatically attract buyers. It won’t. Companies that spend years perfecting their product, without bringing early adopters on board, often fail. Likewise, focusing on large multinational customers as innovators or early adopters is a fatal error. We can think of just a handful of companies that have converted commercial deals with global multinationals as their first or early adopters.

The winners engage potential customers early. They focus on initial customer segments that can allow market entry at pace, ideally at a premium, even if the total market size is smaller. In an ideal world, they go beyond letters of intent (LOIs) to secure paid pilots and joint development agreements before scaling. These commitments provide validation and create customer pull, making the eventual commercial launch far less risky.

We’ve seen companies with inferior technology win market share because they had early adopter buy-in. Meanwhile, technically superior start-ups struggle because they waited for the ‘perfect product.’

3. Redefining MVP in hardware: Segment, model, product

The classic concept of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) doesn’t always translate perfectly to hardware or deep tech. You can’t really ship a half-baked prototype in a highly regulated market. Instead, we think in terms of:

Minimum Viable Segment: Proving the value in a specific niche (e.g., low-volume EVs before targeting mainstream OEMs), which is big enough to make sense for initial product development, and small enough and innovative enough to be your first customer.

Minimum Viable Business Model: Demonstrating through a focused go-to-market strategy, developing the minimum viable asset set to service your identified first customer segment.

Minimum Viable Product: A product with just enough functionality to attract customer traction (including regulatory requirements) of this first segment.

For mobility start-ups, an MVP ≠ prototype. It’s about proving an initial business model, of which your product is just one part.

4. Customer segmentation beats market segmentation

It’s tempting to segment the market by industry verticals – electric vehicles, automated systems, energy, etc. However, customer segmentation is a much more powerful tool.

Understanding who your target customers are, what their specific pain points are, and how they make purchasing decisions is far more valuable than broad market segmentation. Focus on solving problems for a defined group, and you can unlock tailored marketing strategies, product features, and sales approaches that resonate with them directly.

We’ve seen companies waste valuable time and resources targeting the wrong customer segment. The secret lies in identifying who truly needs your solution and aligning your strategy with their needs.

5. Focus beats spread betting

Mobility start-ups often fall into the trap of trying to address every possible use case, every market, and every customer. The temptation to spread your bets is natural, especially when you’re trying to secure investors and prove product-market fit.

However, companies that scale successfully usually have a laser focus – whether it’s on a specific vehicle type, a technology, or a customer segment. Successful start-ups know where to concentrate their efforts. They take measured risks and refuse to get distracted by every opportunity that presents itself. They fail their business model fast, if an element of their delivery isn’t going to work, or their hypothesis about a particular customer segment turns out to be wrong, they pivot to a new, focused plan.

6. Listen first, sell later

Listening is the foundation of successful partnerships and product development. Many mobility start-ups make the mistake of pitching their product before truly understanding the customer problem. When you lead with your solution, you risk missing the point.

Companies should instead develop their “customer discovery” muscles. Only by actively listening to customers’ pain points can you develop solutions that matter. Whether you’re talking to a potential partner or a target customer, engage in deep listening to ensure that your product genuinely addresses their challenges.

7. Roadmaps beat business plans

Business plans are useful, but they often fail to address the real-world uncertainties that start-ups face. Roadmaps, on the other hand, allow flexibility.

Instead of adhering strictly to a business plan with rigid timelines and fixed assumptions, a roadmap reflects the company’s strategic vision and lays out the critical steps in development. We would like to see roadmaps that cover at least the market segment focus, product readiness, business model, assets, people, and finance.

The successful start-ups we’ve worked with don’t just follow a business plan – they develop adaptive roadmaps that evolve with changing market conditions, customer needs, and technological breakthroughs.

8. Market pull beats technology push

It’s tempting to develop a product based purely on technological capability and then hope the market catches up. This technology push mentality is a common pitfall, but the market almost always proves harder to crack than you expect.

Instead, market pull is where sustainable growth comes from. Innovators need to understand the real needs of the market and align their product with those needs. Whether it’s emissions reductions, cost-efficiency, or safety improvements, market demand will always drive successful commercialisation.

This is why we advocate for start-ups to focus on understanding the customer needs first and then develop the technology that fits within that landscape.

9. Think end-to-end, not just one point in time

It’s easy to think in terms of discrete milestones – like securing seed funding or launching a prototype. But building a sustainable business requires investing in the entire end-to-end journey.

Successful companies don’t just focus on raising investment for their current activities and next set of milestones; they look for partners that buy into their business roadmap from where they have been, to where they are going next, to when and how they exit.

If you’re only focused on one point in time – whether it’s R&D or a funding round – you will miss the broader picture.

10. Success is within your reach

Any innovation, any early-stage company, is naturally a high-risk proposition. It’s true, but invariably in our experience, it is not technology issues that stop companies from making progress. It’s all the other stuff! With the right skills, the right team, the right mentality, the right connections, and the right support, making progress in this industry is absolutely possible.

If you are on your innovation journey in clean, connected, or automated mobility and you feel like you might have something that can make a difference, the APC and Zenzic are here to help you make that happen.

Conclusion: The right support for mobility innovation

The journey from start-up to scale-up in mobility innovation isn’t for the faint-hearted. There are a few shortcuts and plenty of challenges. But by focusing on the right support at the right time, understanding your customers deeply, and staying adaptive in your approach, you can dramatically increase your chances of success.

Looking back over the past ten years, these lessons have shaped how we support companies in the mobility sector. We’ve learned that success isn’t just about great technology – it’s about the strategy, timing, and relationships that support its journey.

In a significant step for sustainable aviation, Swiss tech startup Metafuels has announced plans to establish its first commercial-scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant in the Port of Rotterdam. This move underscores the Netherlands’ reputation as hub for sustainable innovation in aviation fuels.

Metafuels’ CEO Saurabh Kapoor has said that this new facility, named Turbe, represents a “major step forward” toward ramping up SAF production. The startup also announced plans to build a similar facility in Denmark last year.

The facility will be built in partnership with liquid energy storage provider Evos. Turbe will be integrated into Evos’ existing Rotterdam terminal, which provides access to the infrastructure needed to store green methanol in large quantities.

Welcome addition to Dutch Chemical Cluster

Metafuels’ establishment makes a welcome addition to the existing chemical cluster in the Netherlands, which already has deep expertise in biorefining, helping to make the cluster more sustainable.

Boudewijn Siemons, CEO Port of Rotterdam, said: “We are delighted that Metafuels, as an innovative producer of e-SAF, has chosen Rotterdam for the development of a new production facility. This development contributes to the climate goals for aviation and further strengthens Rotterdam’s position as a leading hub for renewable fuels.”

SAF technology leading to efficiencies

Metafuels’ “aerobrew” technology converts renewable methanol into jet fuel, using a process which delivers high energy efficiency and up to 90% lower life cycle emissions than conventional jet fuel. The resulting SAF is “drop-in ready,” requiring no changes to aircraft or airport infrastructure.

Turbe will be able to process both bio-methanol, sourced from biological waste, and e-methanol, which is made using renewable electricity and captured CO2. This adaptability allows Metafuels to respond to shifts in feedstock availability and regulatory demand.

The new site will produce 12,000 litres of SAF per day during its first phase, with ambitions to scale this tenfold in the second phase. As a reference, a Boeing 737 Max has a fuel tank capacity of around 26,000 litres, which equates to a range of around 6,570 km.

To underline the potential for growth, SAF made up only 0.53% of global aircraft fuel use in 2024. However, the European Union has ambitions to increase SAF use to 70% by 2050, which will require a significant increase in the production of the greener fuel.

Dutch SAF: a growing ecosystem

With global demand rising for sustainable solutions in the aviation industry, the Dutch chemical ecosystem is proving it’s up for the challenge, with Metafuels adding to an already established group of SAF companies that have built a presence in the Netherlands.

For example, Swiss energy commodities trader Gunvor has forged a partnership with VARO Energy, in which VARO will build a large-scale SAF manufacturing facility at Gunvor’s site in Rotterdam. Also in Rotterdam, Dutch logistics and energy company Koole Terminals is expanding its distillation capacities to triple SAF production by this year.

Meanwhile, Finland-based Neste is investing to expand capacity at its refinery operations in Rotterdam to produce greater amounts of SAF along with renewable diesel. South African Sasol and Denmark-based Topsoe are also teaming up in the Netherlands to bring SAF to market through their joint venture Zaffra.

The future of SAF in the Netherlands

Around the world, companies in the chemical sector are just beginning to explore the full possibilities of SAF in its many forms. As a country committed to sustainability and innovation, the Netherlands is a global hub for all types of operations related to producing, moving and advancing SAF.

The legislation also supports compliance with the UK’s SAF Mandate, which requires 10% of jet fuel used on UK flights to be sustainable by 2030, rising to 22% by 2040.
SAF is a crucial element in the plan to decarbonise aviation… this legislation will help to do that.”","The UK has introduced new legislation aimed at accelerating the production and use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Announced in Parliament this week, the measures are designed to cement Britain’s place as a leader in the production of SAF.

Aviation Minister Mike Kane described the policy as a “take off” moment for sustainable flight, hailing the new regulations as central to a wider push to decarbonise the sector.

“I want to see a golden age for green aviation and today sees take off for sustainable flights,” he said. “We are making the UK one of the best places in the world to produce sustainable aviation fuel, putting the pedal down on growth and boosting job opportunities across the country as part of the Plan for Change.”

Underpinning the package is a revenue certainty mechanism (RCM), funded by a levy on aviation fuel suppliers, which will provide price stability for SAF producers while capping the impact on ticket prices to an average of £1.50 per year. This gives fuel developers the confidence to scale up operations without passing significant costs.

Some £400,000 in new government funding has been earmarked to fast-track the certification and market readiness of new SAF technologies. This follows £63 million allocated earlier this year via the Advanced Fuels Fund.

The legislation also supports compliance with the UK’s SAF Mandate, which requires 10% of jet fuel used on UK flights to be sustainable by 2030, rising to 22% by 2040.

Industry figures have welcomed the move. Tim Alderslade, Chief Executive of Airlines UK, said: “This is a welcome announcement given the importance of the RCM to commercialising and scaling-up SAF production in the UK, a technology key to decarbonising aviation by 2050.”

The company is seeing early success in selling low-carbon fuels and has plans to make the business profitable in the future.

Notably, tax credits, project funding, and small SAF plant installations are driving its growth. These efforts will also help Gevo grow in the SAF market and reach its sustainability goals.

Gevo’s Revenue Surges on Acquisition, RNG Growth, and Carbon Credit Gains

Gevo’s Q1 2025 revenue hit $30.9 million, a significant increase from last year. This growth includes $22.8 million from the newly acquired Gevo North Dakota. It also features gains in renewable natural gas (RNG) and environmental credits.

The RNG segment earned $5.7 million, up $1.7 million from last year. This boost came from a favorable carbon intensity (CI) score from California’s LCFS program.

Environmental attributes sales totaled $5.4 million.

Gevo North Dakota produced 11.1 million gallons of low-carbon ethanol and sequestered about 29,000 metric tons of CO2.

RNG output reached 79,963 MMBtu, resulting in over 60,000 metric tons of LCFS credits.

Carbon Abatement Gains Market Traction

In Q1, Gevo recorded over 100,000 metric tons of carbon abatement, now viewed as a marketable product. This includes captured and sequestered carbon, plus emissions avoided from using low-carbon fuels. The company expects Section 45Z tax credits to further enhance its adjusted EBITDA in 2025.

Dr. Patrick Gruber, Gevo’s Chief Executive Officer, commented,

“We believe we can get to positive Adjusted EBITDA this year for the company. This is in spite of the perceived headwinds and noise in the marketplace. We have real products to sell now that we own our North Dakota plant. Gevo North Dakota produces ethanol, animal feed, corn oil, and importantly, carbon abatement. The carbon abatement value is generated by capturing CO2 and sending it more than a mile underground into what we think is the best well (or sequestration site) in the country. Having this carbon abatement available to us has opened up new doors in the marketplace as customers and partners don’t have to wait around for synthetic aviation fuel (“SAF”) projects to be built to start developing the market in a real sense. We have approval from the Internal Revenue Service to apply for the Section 45Z tax credit, so we will do that, and that should help meet our Adjusted EBITDA goals.”

New Jet Fuel Offtake Deals Signal Growth Path

In April, Gevo secured two new offtake agreements:

Future Energy Global (FEG) signed for 10 million gallons/year of SAF and its Scope 1 and 3 emissions credits.

Another buyer committed to 5 million gallons/year of SAF, separate from the associated carbon abatement credits.

These deals will help fund Gevo’s upcoming ATJ projects in the Dakotas, including the 30 MGPY modular ATJ-30 facility, which is already 50% contracted.

Dr. Gruber further emphasized that Gevo stands out in the ATJ space by using proven, scalable technologies to produce high-yield, low-cost jet fuel with a low carbon intensity. Backed by 100+ patents, Gevo’s innovation attracted Axens, which licensed Gevo’s advanced ATJ processes.

Gevo is Paving the Way for a Low-Carbon Future

Gevo is a pioneer in low-carbon fuels and chemicals from renewable sources. Its advanced technology makes Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), motor fuels, and eco-friendly materials. These products work well with current engines and infrastructure. This ensures an easy transition from fossil fuels.

Patented Ethanol-to-Olefins (ETO) process

In September, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted Gevo a patent (U.S. Patent No. 12,043,587 B2) for its Ethanol-to-Olefins (ETO) process. This boosts its role in renewable fuels. This patent protects their advanced catalyst technology that efficiently converts ethanol into olefins.

Gevo’s SAF Technology

Gevo and LG Chem are collaborating to scale this process for chemical use. They want to improve the technology for business use. This creates a greener option to regular petrochemical olefins.

Their goal is to streamline fuel production by making larger olefins directly from ethanol in one step. These olefins can then be turned into transportation fuels using proven refining methods.

This innovation boosts efficiency, cuts energy use, and lowers costs. Most importantly, it helps achieve zero or even negative carbon emissions, making biofuels more sustainable.

SAF: The New Path to Net Zero

Through its Verity subsidiary, Gevo ensures transparency in sustainability tracking. As global jet fuel demand rises, SAF presents a significant opportunity to cut emissions and promote a cleaner future.

Its proprietary ATJ technology is a game changer for its cost efficiency and environmental impact. It can produce jet fuel at prices competitive with traditional oil-based options while achieving ultra-low to net-zero carbon intensity.

The system can offset over 600,000 metric tons of CO₂ annually—three times more carbon than the amount of fuel produced.

It cuts fossil natural gas use by 65%, making it highly energy-efficient.

Thus, cutting carbon emissions through renewable fuels and chemicals is their main goal. Gevo runs one of the biggest dairy-based renewable natural gas plants in the U.S. It also has an ethanol plant that uses carbon capture technology.

With active carbon capture, proven SAF pathways, and new market partnerships, Gevo can expand its renewable energy business and reach profitability this year.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2304873649.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 13:56:35.872148

Adrian Del Maestro is global energy advisory lead for AECOM, an engineering and construction firm.

Just a few years ago, a net-zero future felt almost certain. From the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States to the European Green New Deal, major economies leaped forward in a burst of green optimism. Even limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius seemed possible.

However, 2025 feels quite different.

An emerging array of tariffs is set to complicate the economics of low-carbon projects; geopolitical tensions have led many governments to refocus investment on new defense imperatives, perhaps to the detriment of transition spend; and more broadly, energy resilience is dominating national and corporate agendas, meaning natural gas and nuclear are rising to prominence.

Net-zero, it seems, is entering a reset. And the data bears that out.

Though clean energy investment totaled an impressive $2.1 trillion in 2024, growth in spending roughly halved compared to the three years prior. Even as investment in solar and wind continues to increase, spending on emerging transition technologies like carbon capture and storage (CCS) and hydrogen dropped by 23% in 2024.

If this reset gathers momentum, the implications will prove severe in the short- to medium-term. It will have a range of adverse impacts, from accelerating climate change to undermining the adoption of critical transition technologies.

Getting net-zero back on track will not be straightforward. Yet there is still time for a course correct. This will require a renewed emphasis on energy resilience, one that refocuses limited resources on key technologies while removing barriers to what is already profitable.

For governments, it is important to retain their long-term focus on delivering net-zero — whatever the short-term priorities around profitability that shape corporate thinking. That starts with enabling technologies.

Grid modernization, for instance, must remain a key priority. Not only does it support ongoing electrification, but also cuts across all forms of energy and electrification trends. Sustaining grid modernization efforts will require a range of policy decisions, from accelerating permitting to enable grid connections to increased community stakeholder engagement, to ensure projects are delivered swiftly. In the UK for example, the Planning and Infrastructure Bill will be critical to enabling the “Clean Power by 2030” ambition. The bill will prioritize connections to projects that are ready to go rather than speculative ones under the former “first come, first served” process. In tandem with investment in grid infrastructure, countries and their respective regulators should continue to promote energy storage solutions, from batteries to pumped hydro, to address the challenge of intermittency as renewables gain momentum.

These approaches will also accelerate some of today’s most commercially viable and competitive energy technologies: solar PV and wind. Too often, they can become stalled by lengthy permitting processes and regulatory hurdles. Clearing these barriers can help keep renewable capacity on track to triple by the end of the decade [1] while also bolstering resilience against surging energy demands and global instability.

Other sectors, however, will find it harder to electrify. Heavy industry, aviation and shipping all contribute significantly to global emissions yet remain difficult to abate. For example, in global aviation, as of 2024, sustainable aviation fuel production represented only about 0.5% of global jet fuel use. These sectors must remain the focus of government policymaking and, especially, increasingly limited public funding.

The challenge for heavy industry is linked to the fact that emerging technologies like CSS and hydrogen still face fundamental challenges around technology maturity, affordability and ability to scale up. As a result, government policymakers will need to do much more to de-risk these projects and stimulate consumer demand. This will be challenging given the macroeconomic environment. Historically, governments have focused subsidy support on encouraging the supply of hydrogen. However, given the paucity of final investment decisions in the sector, governments may need to focus more on stimulating demand for hydrogen. Such investment will prove essential for nations seeking to foster domestic options for low-carbon industrial production in an era of unstable global trade.

While this “reset” presents challenges for emerging technologies, nevertheless, expect new investment plays that span the sphere of interest for governments and business alike, such as transport infrastructure clusters.

Ports, for instance, are the next wave of industrial clusters to electrify with their multi-modal transport connections for ships, trains and drayage. The cruise industry, for instance, is already pursuing decarbonization through adoption of shore power. Ports are also the staging ground for the deployment of offshore wind, and, for governments, are key hubs for economic growth, stimulating local employment and attracting private sector investment. As strategic nodes for global trade, their electrification will provide an additional layer of resilience for supply chains while enabling the growth of offshore wind farms or connections to hydrogen hubs. Electrification is readily viable. In the U.S., the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have been leaders in electrification, with the Port of Los Angeles the first in the world to electrify a container ship in 2004.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/aphN_31THb20dJVMFRFcyVsLZgJrYleIaDd6W5jdupc/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNDgyODgzOTE5LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-05-16 13:56:40.723816

The Canadian company, which operates under the name New Horizon Aircraft, says the Cavorite X7’s fan-in-wing design bridges the gap between helicopter agility and fixed-wing efficiency.

Fourteen lift fans embedded within the aircraft’s wings enable vertical takeoff and landing before the wing covers slide shut for high-speed cruise flight, a sequence the company describes as a “non-event”.

“Horizon Aircraft has designed unique transforming wings that slide to cover the vertical lift fans, enabling fast and efficient forward flight,” Chief Operating Officer Jason O’Neill told Zag Daily. “These covers articulate in a manner similar to the flaps on a commercial airliner. Multiple layers of safety controls ensure the wing covers open and close in a fully synchronized event.”

This design approach is a direct response to the challenges that have plagued other eVTOL developers, particularly those relying on tilt-rotors or heavy pivoting mechanisms. “The versatility of our eVTOL design, capable of both vertical landings and conventional runway operations, allows the Cavorite X7 to operate with exceptional safety,” O’Neill added.

The company now turns its attention to building a full-scale, piloted demonstrator to further prove the design’s stability in real-world conditions. Certification work is already underway with Cert Centre Canada, which specialises in guiding aircraft through Transport Canada and FAA approval pathways.

Horizon says its hybrid-electric architecture is designed with a clear path to full electrification in future. In its current form, the aircraft can reduce hydrocarbon emissions by up to 30% compared to conventional aircraft performing similar missions.

The aircraft has been specifically developed for regional missions involving passengers, cargo, and emergency services, scenarios where access to aviation or sustainable aviation fuel ensures the aircraft can deliver both the range and speed required. O’Neill said that while Horizon sees a fully electric future ahead, the company is already working closely with battery makers and hydrogen specialists to chart a practical and sustainable transition.

Initial commercial applications are expected to focus on mission-critical operations such as medevac and emergency services—scenarios where time sensitivity trumps infrastructure limitations.

“Following entry into service, we anticipate initial use cases will focus on the most time-sensitive missions, including medevac, emergency services, and critical cargo,” said O’Neill. “As our eVTOL production scales, we expect to see growing demand across regional passenger transport and military applications.”

The Cavorite X7 is targeting speeds of up to 250 mph and a range exceeding 500 miles with reserves, positioning it for the emerging Regional Air Mobility (RAM) market.",https://zagdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cropped-E24-0416_X7Military_Refueling_11_withGround.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 11:56:32.887923

The sustainable aviation fuel industry has been all over the map in recent years, so it’s no surprise to see the field branch into the idea of combining green hydrogen with direct air carbon capture. Both fields have met with pushback as initial promises of a quick takeoff have bumped up against the harsh reality of lethargic offtake. However, the Swiss firm Metafuels is confident that SAF can make green H2 and captured CO2 play nice together.

A Rocky Road For SAF From Biofuels

Metafuels also includes a role for biomass in its SAF production system. That can also trigger some skepticism. Bio-based jet fuel has been kicking around the fringes since the early 2000’s without gaining much traction among offtakers.

New plant feedstocks could help kick the industry into gear. In the meantime, though, some industry leaders have been pulling back. In April, for example, Bloomberg reported that BP has hit the pause button on an SAF project at its refinery in Castellon, Spain, according to an anonymous source.

“The decision to pause the biofuels investment was taken due to weaker-than-expected growth in that market, the person said, asking not to be identified because the information is private,” Bloomberg observed.

A New Hope For SAF From E-Fuels

Leaving the direct plant-to-fuel pathway aside, SAF innovators like Metafuels have been heading off in the direction of e-fuels (electrofuels). Electrofuel systems deploy electricity, preferably from renewable resources, to push hydrogen gas from water, as an input for synthetic hydrocarbon liquid fuels.

Metaplant’s “aerobrew” SAF follows the same general outline. “Green H2 can be generated from water electrolysis driven by renewable electricity while CO2 can be removed from the atmosphere using direct air capture technology (DAC) or captured from other biogenic sources,” Metafuels explains.

“Alternatively, green H2 and carbon oxides can be generated from biomass gasification,” Metafuels adds. Its system is designed to switch between biobased green methanol and e-methanol, or do both at the same time, depending on market conditions.

Without giving away too many details (or any at all), the company also notes that it has validated a new high performing, nano-tech based catalytic system to convert its green methanol to SAF.

“The result is a drop-in fuel that reduces life cycle emissions by up to 90% compared to conventional jet fuel, without requiring aircraft re-engineering or infrastructure changes,” Metafuels notes , emphasizing the all-important element of compatibility with existing jet fuel equipment and infrastructure.

Follow The Money To SAF

Aerobrew has already gained traction among investors and public funders. Metafuels describes itself as “one of Europe’s best-funded SAF startups,” with a total of $22 million in funding over the past two years including a $5 million grant from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy.

Last year the company announced plans to launch its “Pizol” production facility in Denmark, and earlier today it announced plans for a second facility, named Turbe, to be located at the Port of Rotterdam.

The Rotterdam plant will launch at 12,000 liters of e-SAF daily, then step up to full volume at 120,000 liters (about 31,700 US gallons) with the support of the energy and chemicals storage firm Evos.

SAF Is Coming For Your Fossil Fuels

In today’s announcement, Metafuels advises that an FID (Final Investment Decision) on the Turbe facility will not happend until halfway through next year, after hitting the FEED (front-end engineering and design) milestone.

However, with the EU targeting the expansion of e-SAF in its decarbonization policy, Metafuels is confident that offtakers will materialize. “Policymakers are relying on a substantial increase in e-SAF capacity over the next decade, with the EU’s synthetic SAF sub-mandate set to begin at 1.2% from 2030 rising to 35% from 2050,” the company explains.

Metafuels is already looking ahead to additional opportunities for its all-in-one, scalable integrated e-SAF facilities, and they are not the only innovator seeking to push fossil energy out of the aviation fuels market. The Port of Rotterdam also aims to host another major SAF facility under a partnership between the Dutch liquid fuels storage firm Advario and Power2X, another Dutch startup.

Power2X includes hydrogen produced from conventional fossil resources under its business umbrella, but the company is also zeroing in on the electrofuels market and that’s where the Port of Rotterdam expects it to land.

“The Power2X production facility will have the capacity to produce over 250,000 tonnes/year of e-SAF, a non-fossil, synthetic fuel made from green hydrogen,” the Port announced last October.

“It will be the largest e-SAF facility announced to-date, making sufficient ultra-low carbon fuel to fully power approximately 7,000 flights between Amsterdam and New York annually,” they added.

Instead of producing green methanol on site, the Power2X facility will import green methanol produced from green hydrogen. “Green methanol will be imported from locations where renewable energy and green hydrogen are abundant,” the Port emphasized.

On the carbon side, apparently Power2X will deploy biogenic resources, rather than direct air capture. As of earlier this year the project was still moving forward with the award of an engineering services contract.

Meanwhile, Here In The USA…

The news just keeps getting worse, worser, and worserer here in the US, as President Donald J. Trump rampages through the government, destroying invaluable public assets with the gleeful assistance of Tesla CEO Elon Musk while throwing one monkey wrench after another into the renewable energy transition.

Still, within the muck of Trump’s fossil-friendly “American Energy Dominance” policy is a carve-out for biomass, and individual US states are continuing to push the SAF envelope with supportive policies.

In March, for example, the leading e-fuels firm HIF Global announced that the California Air Resource Board has awarded approval on its e-fuels pathway under the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, the first such approval in the US.

“This LCFS certification underscores the growing demand for e-Fuels in the U.S. and globally, which could reach more than 250 mtpa by 20351, providing opportunity for over $1 trillion in potential capital investment in new facilities to produce the fuels,” stated HIF Global Board Executive Director Meg Gentle. In addition to e-SAF, the certification covers e-naptha and e-diesel.

HIF was one of the first e-fuels firms to surface on the CleanTechnica radar back in 2022, when it announced plans to produce e-fuels in Texas. The facility is still on track as of March.

If it falls through, no biggie. The US is not the only game in town. HIF already has an e-fuels facility up and running in Chile, and it also has commercial scale plans in the works for Uruguay and Australia in addition to the US.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-esaf-metafuels-rotterdam.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 11:56:40.424820

Montana Renewables and Calumet Montana Refining are taxed separately, but together are the county’s largest taxpayers.
FARM TO FUEL Montana Renewables aims to leverage area ag producers to supply products it can turn into sustainable aviation fuels and renewable diesel.","Black Eagle is an industry town. The community sprang up to support the nearby copper smelter, operated for the longest time by the Anaconda Copper Mining Company. Banners along the main drag still depict the massive smokestack that defined the industrial skyline for decades until its demolition in 1981.

The copper smelter is long gone, shuttered just before the stack fell. Fewer than 1,000 people live in the community today. But residents of Black Eagle, which is not part of Great Falls but is adjacent to its northeast corner, still have industry neighbors in the Calumet oil refinery.

Living downwind of the refinery makes the distinct scent of the operation a regular part of life.

“In the summer, you don’t leave your windows open, because you never know,” said Jim Helgeson, a former Great Falls Transit general manager who has lived in Black Eagle for 50 years.

Helgeson is no stranger to this industrial corridor. His parents immigrated from Norway to Great Falls and worked for the Anaconda Company, the predominant industrial operation to the east of Black Eagle. That shuttered in 1980 under the ownership of Atlantic Richfield Company.

These days, it’s the Calumet oil refinery to the west that is undergoing change.

“It’s definitely growing in square footage down there over the last few years,” Helgeson said. “With that, we kind of expected that the smell was going to increase.”

That growth is accelerating at the refinery. Calumet formed a subsidiary, Montana Renewables, which has taken over a substantial portion of the refinery for a biofuels plant and already produces about 10,000 barrels daily. In the coming years, the company will more than double that production, funded by a $1.6 billion loan guarantee from the federal government.

The loan came from a program of former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which funneled billions of dollars to projects that could help achieve climate goals. The biofuels operation in Great Falls can take agricultural products like canola oil, rendered cow fat (beef tallow) and camelina oil and process them into products called renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

The Biden administration was especially bullish on sustainable aviation fuel, saying it would significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions in the airline industry. The administration launched a “grand challenge” to incentivize its production and reach a goal of a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

But climate benefits down the supply chain could come at the expense of increased air emissions at the Great Falls site. Although Montana Renewables touts its environmental benefits, projections from the company suggest that the biofuels plant could emit more air pollutants than the site emitted as a crude oil refinery.

Despite these projections, Montana Renewables is seeking to make the plant fully exempt from property taxes by qualifying the entire facility as “pollution control equipment.”

“This is a major industrial facility that is expected, by its own estimates, to emit significant amounts of air pollutants that will impact the health of the surrounding communities,” said Jim Duffy, a Great Falls resident and former official at the California Air Resources Board, a primary industry regulator in that state.

The fuels produced at Montana Renewables have the potential to reduce emissions relative to petroleum-based alternatives when burned in a diesel truck or airplane. But the full environmental impact of the entire biofuels lifecycle, from seeds in the ground to airplane exhaust, isn’t yet fully known for this small but growing industry.

At the production stage here in Great Falls, however, that growth could mean the emission of more harmful pollutants just upwind of Black Eagle.

GROWTH INDUSTRY

Calumet has consistently scaled up operations at the Great Falls refinery. The Indiana company purchased the facility in 2012 from the Montana Refining Company and quickly expanded its output of products made from Canadian crude oil.

By 2016, production grew from about 10,000 barrels of fuel and asphalt per day to a capacity of 25,000 through a $400 million project. Hundreds of workers imported for that project had to arrive by bus because there was so little parking around the facility. Great Falls grew closely around the 100-year-old refinery, which is sandwiched between the Missouri River and the busy, eponymous Smelter Avenue. There’s a Walmart and a restaurant across the street and a middle school just up the road.

That growth in 2016 is dwarfed in cost by the multi-year expansion currently underway to convert the refinery into a leading biofuels production plant. Montana Renewables formed in 2021 and began producing fuel from agricultural-based materials, like canola oil and soybean oil. The creation of the subsidiary formed two different operations at the plant: Calumet, remaining in the petroleum refining business, and Montana Renewables, the growing biofuels producer.

Montana Renewables has said its work will “significantly advance national efforts to address climate change” and reduce transportation emissions. In addition to the ability to transition away from crude oil as raw materials, the fuels are beneficial because they are “drop-in,” meaning they can be used in current airplane and diesel engines. Importantly, sustainable aviation fuel still needs to be blended with conventional jet fuel for use.

“You’ve got to think about the integration of the energy industry at large, in that you need a consumer who has a large demand for the fuel that you’re going to produce,” John Coates, director of the Energy and Biosciences Institute at the University of California Berkeley, told Montana Free Press. “The easiest way to do that is to have a drop-in fuel.”

Calumet secured private financing to get Montana Renewables up and running, according to regulatory filings. In 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy announced a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to Montana Renewables, which will fund the next phase of the expansion. That will bring the production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel from about 10,000 barrels per day to a target of 21,500 barrels per day, or 330 million gallons per year. It’s expected to be completed by late 2027.

The company hopes to leverage regional ag producers to supply the plant-based raw materials for biofuel production. In written statements and comments to MTFP, the company said that it will provide a steady market for crop producers. So far, Montana Renewables is importing most of those raw materials from out of state.

“Our success is tied to Montana agriculture producers, and we are looking forward to creating new markets for crops here in Montana, supporting economic growth in our local ag sector,” a company spokesperson for Montana Renewables told MTFP in a statement.

That story of biofuel production for the benefit of ag producers drew bipartisan political support from Republicans like U.S. Sen. Steve Daines and Gov. Greg Gianforte, and Democrats like former U.S. Sen Jon Tester. The project is viewed locally as an economic boost for Great Falls, and the company has promised to add as many as 40 permanent jobs as part of the venture.

But with potential benefits come potential costs, which can be measured both in tax dollars and in tons of pollution.

EMISSIONS AT THE SOURCE

To receive the loan guarantee from the federal government, Montana Renewables was subject to a lengthy environmental assessment. That report included a projection of the maximum air emissions for several pollutants once the full biofuels plant expansion was completed.

The estimates show that the biofuels plant could emit more sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, carbon monoxide and particulate matter than the facility did as a dedicated petroleum refinery.

The emissions from Montana Renewables could outpace those of the Calumet petroleum refinery even while producing less. In 2020, Calumet reported producing 26,742 barrels (daily) of asphalt and fuels made from crude oil. Estimates for target biofuel production at Montana Renewables range from 21,500 to 24,000.

In an interview with MTFP, Calumet/Montana Renewables Senior Vice President Kollin Schade said that the estimated emissions represent a maximum that the plant may not reach during routine operation.

“As we know, the actual emissions are always much lower than the potential to emit,” he said.

Past emissions data show mixed results relative to projections. In 2014, Calumet projected emissions increases that would result from its first expansion of the crude oil refinery. Actual emissions data show that the plant stayed within those projections for many pollutants, but it exceeded those projections by 2016 for pollutants like carbon monoxide and particulate matter. Those exceedances still fell within permitted limits.

When asked if Montana Renewables’ emissions would surpass those of the petroleum refinery even if it did not meet the operational maximum, Schade declined to answer directly.

“All I can say is we’re going to stay at the level of whatever the permitted numbers are that we get from the EPA and the DEQ,” Schade said. “Those are the numbers that are viable to maintain the environmental quality of the air content around the refinery.”

While the pollution estimates are intended to represent the emissions of the plant running at full capacity, they aren’t the same as permitted limits, which can have much higher ceilings than actual emissions. For example, the Montana Renewables and Calumet site is permitted to emit up to 1,515 tons of sulfur dioxide annually, but its estimated actual emissions are a fraction of the permitted limit.

The emissions estimates could force the facility to transition from a “minor” to a “major” emitter under an EPA program known as Prevention of Significant Deterioration. The program is intended to track and permit increases in air pollution from major emitters and has thresholds for certain pollutants that trigger a facility to graduate from minor to major. Montana Renewables indicated in its environmental report that it expected to apply for major status under the program, which requires permitting and additional emissions projections for approval.

Even while Montana Renewables scales up, the Calumet crude oil refinery remains in operation. Though it downsized to make room for its subsidiary, the petroleum side of the plant emitted more carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds in 2023 than it did in the six years before the change, according to emissions reports from the company. And production in 2023 was less than half of the Calumet petroleum refinery’s output at its peak.

Speaking with MTFP, Schade said he believes Montana Renewables is beneficial for the environment and the community.

“From my perspective, it’s a net positive all the way around,” he said. “Employment, agriculture, emissions, the whole bit. I think it’s a win-win-win all the way around.”

BEARING THE TAX BURDEN

In May 2022, the Great Falls City Commission considered a tax break for the Montana Renewables plant. At the time, Calumet had recently settled a multi-year tax protest that reduced the refinery’s property tax bill from $16.9 million to $11 million over three years.

The tax break before the commission was estimated to cost the city nearly $2.8 million in tax revenue over 10 years. Bob Kelly, Great Falls’ mayor at the time, said during the commission meeting that the city must strike a balance between supporting its growing industries and protecting tax proceeds from the city’s largest taxpayer.

“When any entity…decides to do a tax protest and have your valuations redone, that causes great consternation in a revenue source for us, because we are fairly dependent upon a substantial amount of money to flow out of that expansion,” Kelly said.

The premise was that the benefit would last 10 years and incentivize growth and investment in the tax base. After that decade, tax proceeds from the fully expanded plant could flow to the city. The commission unanimously approved the break for Montana Renewables.

Months after that decision, in December 2022, Montana Renewables filed an application to make its entire plant exempt from property taxes in perpetuity. The company asked state regulators to make the biofuel facility, which it valued at $562 million, tax-exempt by qualifying the entire operation as “pollution control equipment.”

The pollution control tax exemption, enshrined in Montana law, applies to “portions” of equipment or machinery that prevent the creation of air or water pollutants. These are often specific devices added to refinery equipment to curb emissions, trap pollutants or otherwise reduce chemicals being emitted. But Montana Renewables has argued that because it uses ag-based raw materials and its products can reduce greenhouse gas emissions when used as fuel, the entire plant should be considered one cohesive pollution control system.

“…The MRL [Montana Renewables] facility is a fully integrated facility, which provides identifiable and substantial environmental benefits that can be achieved only by operation of the biomass conversion plant and all of its equipment together as one emissions-reducing unit,” the company said in an appeal to state regulators.

In 2023, the Montana Department of Environmental Quality denied a full exemption under the pollution control equipment provision but certified more than $25 million worth of equipment for the benefit — a small portion relative to the entire plant’s value.

In documents and memos for the application, DEQ explained that the statute is aimed at specific devices that reduce emissions at industrial facilities that would otherwise pollute more. It wasn’t the intent of the statute to grant tax exemptions to any facility that reduces the use of fossil fuels elsewhere in the supply chain, the state engineers wrote.

“For instance, under this argument, an owner or operator of a wind-generating facility could argue its facility should be designated as pollution control equipment because the facility avoids emissions that might otherwise occur through fossil fuel electricity generation,” a DEQ engineer wrote in a 2023 memo to the company.

Montana Renewables has appealed DEQ’s determination and maintains that the entire plant qualifies for the exemption. The appeal remains pending, and a hearing is set for August before the Montana Tax Appeal Board in Helena.

Duffy, the former California Air Resources Board regulator, called Montana Renewables’ logic absurd. He has submitted several comments to the DEQ to oppose a full exemption. Like the agency’s initial determination, Duffy said the exemption shouldn’t consider potential benefits down the supply chain, such as in airplane emissions.

“The legislation and administrative rules do not include any language to indicate that emissions impacts that occur either upstream or downstream from the facility should be considered,” he told MTFP.

Duffy also rejected the premise that Montana Renewables could be granted a blanket tax exemption as a pollution control system while the company’s own estimates predict a rise in air emissions. He first compared Montana Renewables’ projected emissions with data from the EPA’s National Emissions Inventory.

In an appeal document to the state Tax Appeal Board, Montana Renewables sought to demonstrate its environmental benefits and wrote that the emissions of several pollutants “are all dramatically lower” than those of the petroleum refinery. The comparison represented the biofuels plant at its current state, prior to the billion-dollar expansion.

However, the tax exemption the company seeks would apply to the fully expanded plant. The company didn’t note its own projections, which estimate the opposite of what was written in the appeal document — that emissions on the biofuels side could surpass those of the petroleum refinery.

Schade, the Montana Renewables senior vice president, said that he expects the appeal to conclude in the near future.

While Montana Renewables pursues a tax exemption, it is also applying for or already receiving a menagerie of other tax incentives. The plant currently gets a 50% tax break from both Cascade County and Great Falls under an expanding industry benefit that lasts 10 years.

In December, the plant applied for a 50% property tax break from the state under a benefit for energy production facilities. A bill brought by Great Falls legislator Steve Fitzpatrick in 2023 added producers of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuels to the eligible list of beneficiaries, and committee testimony specifically referenced the Montana Renewables project. If approved, that tax break would last 15 years.

Montana Renewables also stands to receive federal clean fuel production tax credits of up to $1.75 per gallon of sustainable aviation fuel delivered.

In its latest annual report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Calumet noted that for Montana Renewables, “a significant component of our product margin consists of a variety of government subsidies, incentives and mandates.”

For the petroleum refinery side of the business, Calumet recently received an 80% tax break on $6.1 million of equipment under a state law that benefits new industrial equipment.

And just a few years after settling its last tax protest, Calumet initiated another multi-year tax protest with the state that could potentially reduce the company’s tax liability. That case remains ongoing. Local governments have had to budget around these protested tax proceeds. On May 6, Great Falls Finance Director Melissa Kinzler told the city commission that the city didn’t receive nearly $1.2 million in protested taxes from the refinery for 2024 and expects an additional $360,000 to be withheld for the current fiscal year.

A full tax exemption for Montana Renewables would create a substantial hole in local government budgets. The company’s tax bill for 2024 was nearly $5.8 million, which includes $1.8 million for Great Falls, $1.1 million for Cascade County and $1.5 million for public schools.

Montana Renewables and Calumet Montana Refining are taxed separately, but together are the county’s largest taxpayers. From 2015 to 2024, the company formally challenged its property valuation to the state in seven of those nine years.

FARM TO FUEL

Montana Renewables aims to leverage area ag producers to supply products it can turn into sustainable aviation fuels and renewable diesel. That has been the company’s cornerstone message.

“When you look at the feedstocks, whether it’s canola oil or camelina, whatever it is, we’re looking to boost our local agricultural involvement with this process overall,” Schade told MTFP. “And we really look at this as a massive benefit for Great Falls, for Montana and really the local community.”

Cyndi Johnson farms canola and other crops east of Conrad. She said there isn’t as much demand these days for what she calls “Montana traditional grains” like high-quality wheat and barley. She recently pivoted to growing more canola and is excited about the prospect of the biofuels plant opening up a new market.

“The only way to survive in this day and age is to diversify,” said Johnson, who is also board chair at the Montana Farm Bureau Federation. “And Montana Renewables is giving us that opportunity for diversity.”

Production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuels is a fast-growing industry, and Calumet is not the only oil and gas company making the switch. Phillips 66 converted an entire petroleum refinery in Rodeo, California, to a biofuels plant and now produces 30,000 barrels of renewable diesel daily from ag-based materials.

As these facilities expand, experts are questioning the environmental impacts of diverting cropland for fuel production instead of food. Coates, who directs the Energy and Biosciences Institute at UC Berkeley, said that there’s a real need for transitional fuels to move away from petroleum-based products. But ag-based fuels introduce new factors to consider.

“There’s still the question of land resources, as well as fertilizers and irrigation that all go into this,” he said. “Just because something can be converted to a biofuel doesn’t necessarily mean that it should be, because the environmental footprint of growing that feedstock in the first place might be greater than you might expect.”

Daniel Kammen, a professor of energy also at UC Berkeley, said that a truly sustainable agricultural feedstock wouldn’t compete with crops for human consumption. He pointed to the rise of ethanol production in the late 2000s, which spiked the price of tortillas.

“Very simple statement,” Kammen said. “A biofuel is only as clean as the source if the biomass doesn’t compete with anything. Period, full stop.”

Montana Renewables Plant Manager Ron Colwell addressed that point in 2022 at a Great Falls City Commission meeting, saying that camelina would be a preferred feedstock because it “doesn’t generally compete as a major food product.”

The Montana Renewables plant has adaptable equipment that can make biofuels from beef tallow, distillers’ corn oil, canola oil, used cooking oil and camelina oil. Schade said that this variety allows flexibility for sourcing raw materials and guards against fluctuating prices for any one of those products.

“Just about any seed oil that you can even imagine out there, we will try and bring into the refinery and try to process it,” he said.

A company press release from December indicated that some of those products are coming from farms in Minnesota and the Pacific Northwest. Camelina production is growing in northcentral Montana and got a boost with the opening of Sustainable Oils in Great Falls in 2022. The company specializes in camelina crops for use as biofuel feedstock.

There’s a need for more robust seed crushing plants, which process crops into seed oil, that will open up the market for regional ag producers. Schade said the company is actively looking to support those plants moving into northcentral Montana.

Johnson, who says much of her canola crop is sold to ag product producers like Nutrien and Columbia Grain, disagrees with the idea that her crop would compete for food sources. She said that she and other farmers are following the markets to keep their operations viable.

“I’ve heard some people say that’s going to make less for human consumption,” she said. “That’s not true at all. The people who are growing canola now, who did not grow canola 10 years ago, are growing it because there’s a demand for the oil.”

CLEARED FOR LIFTOFF

While the Trump administration has dismantled some parts of former President Biden’s energy agenda, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge remains in place as a program involving multiple federal agencies, including the Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of Transportation.

An Energy Department spokesperson told MTFP in an email that growing the use of sustainable aviation fuels aligns with Trump’s executive order to “unleash American energy dominance.”

“Both the Trump Administration and this program aim to increase the production of affordable domestically produced fuels, create more export opportunities and fuel choices, support American farmers, and lower energy costs,” the spokesperson wrote.

The government’s plan includes production benchmarks to hit 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050, which would represent 100% adoption by the airline industry. Federal tax credits are part of the incentives offered under the plan, and certain states have their own incentive structures. A prominent example at the state level is California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which Duffy helped to develop.

For Montana Renewables, the enthusiasm from the federal government is a tailwind for the plant’s expansion.

“The DOE, the EPA, they’ve all come out with policies supporting renewable feedstocks [raw materials],” Schade said. “They got into their mathematical equations, and those folks are sharp, and they can see that if you’re looking globally, and you’re trying to reduce certain emissions, the renewable energies are the way to go.”

A federal report on sustainable aviation fuel, which appears to have been removed from government websites, underscored the potential for airline emissions reductions (an archived version of the report is here). It also briefly mentions localized environmental impacts, suggesting that biorefineries “could negatively impact air quality in local communities” through the production and shipping of sustainable aviation fuel.

“Socially vulnerable populations have already felt these impacts due to the similar and more polluting operations of traditional petroleum refineries producing fossil jet fuel,” the report said. “The implementation of emissions control technologies and utilization of low-emission vehicles could reduce these impacts.”

Helgeson, the longtime Black Eagle resident, knows firsthand about dealing with legacy industrial pollution. The Anaconda Company’s smokestack emitted lead, arsenic and metals for decades with little or no environmental regulation. Almost 30 years after the plant closed, EPA studies found lead and arsenic in the yards of Black Eagle residents. Seventeen years after that, work finally started to remove lead-laced soils from those residential yards. That work continues this year.

On the west side of town, the refinery smell persists.

“We’re cleaning it up on one end of town and having it come in from the other,” Helgeson said.",https://montanafreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSCF5547.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 11:56:44.132195

The SAF will then be used for flights that depart from Michigan.
Working collaboratively with our farmers and producers will simultaneously reduce carbon emissions in our atmosphere and support our Michigan economy.
“Sustainable aviation fuel is more than just an environmental solution—it’s a powerful economic opportunity for Michigan’s important agriculture industry,” said Amelia DeLuca, Chief Sustainability Officer at Delta Air Lines.
“I am proud to be part of a commonsense, bipartisan approach to enlisting Michigan farmers in the effort to provide cleaner aviation fuel in our state.","Delta Air Lines on May 7 announced its strong support for new bipartisan, bicameral legislation that will accelerate the growth of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in Michigan while strengthening the state’s agricultural economy and creating new opportunities for farmers.

Senate Bills 235-36, introduced by Sens. Sam Singh (D-East Lansing) and Joe Bellino (R-Monroe), and House Bills 4424-25, introduced by Rep. Jerry Neyer, (R-Shepherd), would establish a $1.50 per gallon tax credit for the purchase, production, or blending of SAF starting in 2026. The credit increases to $2 per gallon for fuels that deliver greater reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The SAF will then be used for flights that depart from Michigan.

“This bipartisan plan will make aviation fuel more accessible and affordable and will help us realize the global vision we spelled out in our landmark Clean Energy Future plan,” Sen. Singh said. “Decarbonizing the aviation sector will not be easy, but we have to start somewhere. Working collaboratively with our farmers and producers will simultaneously reduce carbon emissions in our atmosphere and support our Michigan economy. By tackling this monumental task, we continue to prove that Michigan is a global leader in protecting our environment.”

Rep. Neyer, chair of the House Agriculture Committee, said: “Whether we like it or not, things are changing in Michigan. New clean energy standards are quickly approaching, and pending policy changes from the feds have left corn and soybean farmers with a ‘let’s wait and see’ mentality. And who can blame them? The demand for their products could change with one press conference. This bipartisan plan is a practical solution that will reduce emissions, promote economic growth, and take care of our farmers. By incentivizing the private sector to produce and blend SAF here in Michigan, we can encourage cleaner skies and boost the agriculture industry at the same time.”

By encouraging the use of Michigan-grown feedstocks such as corn and soybeans, the legislation is poised to open new markets for farmers, helping revitalize rural economies and reinforcing the vital connection between agriculture and energy innovation.

“Sustainable aviation fuel is more than just an environmental solution—it’s a powerful economic opportunity for Michigan’s important agriculture industry,” said Amelia DeLuca, Chief Sustainability Officer at Delta Air Lines. “This legislation would help unlock the full potential of homegrown feedstocks to fuel our aircraft and the ag economy. At Delta, we are committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and this legislation gives us the chance to do it in a way that also supports family farms and rural communities across the state.”

The agriculture industry stands to benefit significantly from the emerging SAF market. By using renewable feedstocks from Michigan farms, SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel while also creating stable demand for corn and soybean growers.

“Access to sustainable, reliable, and affordable energy products is critical to long-term economic growth,” Sen. Bellino said. “I am proud to be part of a commonsense, bipartisan approach to enlisting Michigan farmers in the effort to provide cleaner aviation fuel in our state. It is a proactive solution that supports our local farmers, boosts our agriculture industry, and better ensures stable fuel costs — all while also helping cut harmful emissions.”

John Delmotte, President of the Michigan Corn Growers Association and Sen. Bellino’s constituent, said: “This legislation mirrors the successful strategy that made ethanol a staple of American energy—using smart tax credits to create a market-driven solution to benefit farmers, consumers, and our environment. Just like with ethanol, SAF tax credits represent a direct investment in rural America, with huge reverberating benefits. This approach also aligns with President Trump’s goal of prioritizing domestic energy production and American jobs. By advancing SAF, we’re laying the foundation for sustained economic growth across the entire agriculture value chain.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/biomassmagazine/posts/web/2019/09/DeltaPlane_15687573330116.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 10:56:10.593150

Meanwhile, both Luton and Stansted airports have been given permission to expand their terminals in order to allow for higher passenger capacity.
But Warrington said there was “no convincing argument at all that expanding airports will lead to economic growth”.
“If you look at the history of airport expansions ... it’s not creating jobs, it’s not increasing exports – it’s just allowing the small group of wealthy frequent flyers to take even more frequent holidays abroad,” she added.
Aviation is widely recognised as a hard-to-abate sector with regards to carbon emissions, along with shipping, construction and steelmaking.","Proposals to expand Gatwick, Heathrow and Luton airports would make it more difficult for the UK to meet its climate obligations while failing to deliver the mooted economic benefits, MPs have said.

In recent months, the government has granted consent for Heathrow to finally build its long-debated third runway, while transport secretary Heidi Alexander has signalled she is inclined to approve a second runway at Gatwick later this year. Meanwhile, both Luton and Stansted airports have been given permission to expand their terminals in order to allow for higher passenger capacity.

Addressing a group of MPs at a meeting of the Environmental Audit Committee, Johann Beckford, senior policy adviser at Green Alliance, called for a “moratorium” on airport expansions due the long-term extra carbon emissions that will be associated with greater air travel.

“By 2050 the Climate Change Committee suggests that around 400 million or so passengers could travel, which is still a very significant increase ... a 20–28% increase on today,” he said. “If you were to take all of the airport expansions currently on the table ... we’re likely to be seeing more in the region of 500 million passengers travelling per year.”

Committee member Chris Hinchliff, the Labour MP for North East Hertfordshire, said the proposed expansions would require the UK to plant a forest “twice the size of Greater London” by 2028 to counter the additional emissions.

“The reality is that airports are going to want to do everything in their power to make full use of the additional capacity having invested in it,” he added.

The UK is estimated to already have the capacity to meet the growing demand for air travel up to 2050, although the expansions could increase the demand if it leads to falling costs and greater access.

“Ways to increase flights from the UK is just the wrong question ... We should be asking, how severe is the environmental harm this is causing, and will it bring any kind of economic benefits that could counterbalance that?” said Alethea Warrington, head of aviation at climate charity Possible.

The government has cited its efforts to tackle the UK’s sluggish GDP growth as the reason behind its decision to approve the expansions.

But Warrington said there was “no convincing argument at all that expanding airports will lead to economic growth”.

“If you look at the history of airport expansions ... it’s not creating jobs, it’s not increasing exports – it’s just allowing the small group of wealthy frequent flyers to take even more frequent holidays abroad,” she added.

The plant

Metafuels' strategic decision to establish its first large-scale SAF plant in Rotterdam highlights a pivotal moment for sustainable aviation fuel production in Europe. The Rotterdam plant, named Turbe, will be integrated into Evos' existing storage terminal, enabling significant methanol storage capacity and robust logistical infrastructure. This plant aims to produce 12,000 liters of SAF per day initially, with a future goal to scale production tenfold. The collaboration between Metafuels and Evos taps into Rotterdam's critical role as a major transshipment port, facilitating access to renewable methanol from diverse sources, including biomethanol and e-methanol.

According to Metafuels CEO Saurabh Kapoor, the plant aligns with Europe's ambitious decarbonization targets by providing scalable SAF production, a crucial component for aviation to meet future environmental mandates. Despite the promising technology, the SAF market still represents a small fraction of global aviation fuel usage, with only 0.53% of fuel use in 2024 accounted for by SAF. The EU's target for 70% SAF usage by 2050 emphasizes the necessity for projects like Turbe to succeed and expand production capabilities.",https://ioplus.nl/api/media/file/plane-2605014_1280-3.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 10:56:18.418836

Capacity is scaling up, prices are dropping, and production is accelerating well ahead of regulatory deadlines. The real story is not one of failure, but of extraordinary industrial transformation poised to lead Europe’s transport decarbonisation journey.

Europe’s refiners are not just meeting regulatory expectations—they are outperforming them. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production is already on track to exceed the EU’s ReFuelEU targets. Current production capacity of 1.5 million tonnes of HEFA-based SAF, alongside firm investments that will bring an additional 2.4 million tonnes online by 2029, positions the sector to comfortably surpass both the 2025 and 2030 mandates. By 2025, the industry will have already delivered the required 1 million tonnes, and by 2030, it will have more than the necessary 2.7 million tonnes available. This achievement is not speculation—it is backed by data from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and industry tracking from Argus Media, both confirming that Europe’s SAF capacity is set to outpace demand until at least 2035.

Despite this progress, recent public narratives have misrepresented the sector’s performance. Claims derived from an early version of a Boston Consulting Group report wrongly suggest fuel producers are falling short. However, BCG itself has clarified that global bio-SAF production is forecasted to reach up to 12 million tonnes by 2030, well beyond the EU’s 3 million-tonne requirement under ReFuelEU. These misleading accusations not only ignore the hard data but also undermine the critical role European refiners are playing in supporting the continent’s climate goals.

Investments in SAF have come at great risk to Europe’s fuel manufacturers, who have pressed forward despite unstable regulation and uncertain returns. Billions of euros have already been channelled into biorefineries, with seven plants currently delivering 100% renewable fuels for multiple transport sectors. SAF production alone has increased tenfold in just two years, from 100,000 tonnes in 2022 to over 1 million tonnes by 2024. Equally impressive is the dramatic fall in renewable fuel prices, which have dropped by more than 40% relative to conventional jet fuel between 2021 and 2023. This price progress reflects the industry’s commitment to scaling production efficiently, without waiting for perfect policy conditions.

Yet policy remains the largest barrier to unlocking SAF’s full potential. Without coherent, predictable regulatory frameworks, the momentum achieved risks stalling. The industry is calling for urgent action to enable faster growth: recognising innovative production methods, broadening the range of eligible feedstocks, aligning regulatory criteria across EU systems, and providing clear, long-term mandates beyond 2030. Enabling national-level incentives to accelerate production before regulatory deadlines and supporting capital-heavy e-SAF projects through the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan are essential next steps.

Europe’s refiners have already proven they are not obstacles, they are the driving force behind the green transformation of aviation. Their pioneering investments, technological advancements, and growing production capacity demonstrate their strategic value as partners in achieving climate neutrality. The focus now must shift to enabling policies that match this industrial ambition.",https://www.directorstalkinterviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Avation-plc.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 10:56:24.663293

LONDON, UK – The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), in collaboration with global consultancy ICF, has launched a bold new framework urging the entire Travel & Tourism sector to unite in tackling one of its toughest challenges: scaling up the production and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other renewable fuels.

The report, Scaling Up Sustainable Fuel, sets out a practical roadmap for how every business in the sector, no matter its size or role, can help address transport-related emissions and accelerate the shift to cleaner fuels.

Julia Simpson, WTTC President & CEO, said “Sustainable fuel is the single biggest game-changer for Travel & Tourism, but right now, supply falls dangerously short of demand. If we don’t act together, we risk rising costs, limited availability, and stalled climate progress.

“Every hotel, tour operator, travel agency, cruise line and airline has a role to play. This framework gives them the blueprint. Sustainable fuel is not just an environmental necessity; it’s a business imperative and governments must incentivise the production of SAF, not just set targets for the sector.”

Today, SAF accounts for just 0.3% of global jet fuel use. To meet net-zero targets by 2050, production must increase more than 400-fold – from 1.25BN litres today to over 450BN litres. That will require as many as 6,500 new renewable fuel plants worldwide. Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF) faces similar supply and infrastructure constraints.

Unlike other decarbonisation options, SAF is a ‘drop-in’ solution. It works with existing engines and aircraft. But high production costs, limited infrastructure, and feedstock competition have kept volumes low and prices high – up to 10 times that of conventional fuel.

The new WTTC-ICF framework offers clear, tiered actions for Travel & Tourism stakeholders to engage, whether as Collaborators, Promoters, Adopters, or Investors. From joining campaigns and supplying waste products, to funding production facilities or purchasing sustainable fuel certificates, the report makes it clear: every business can contribute.

Daniel Galpin, ICF Managing Director, stated “Decarbonising transport is a crucial step towards achieving a sustainable tourism sector. While transport industries, particularly aviation with its focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), have recognised the importance of sustainable fuels and are couragesouly working towards a new era, there remains a significant journey ahead. It is essential for the broader tourism ecosystem to take action and provide support to meet the targets set, as well as to implement both operational and strategic changes required.

“ICF is proud to have collaborated closely with WTTC to identify the roles that tourism stakeholders can adopt and the actions they can take to facilitate the decarbonisation of the sector, thereby contributing to a more sustainable future.”

Real-world case studies show how action is already underway. The Erawan Group is turning hotel waste oil into SAF, in Asia, whilst Jet2 has invested in a UK-based SAF plant using recyclable household waste.

Crucially, the report warns that unless the sector acts collectively, SAF mandates introduced by governments, requiring a 5% to 10% blend by 2030, could increase travel costs and limit consumer choice.

Swiss aviation technology company Metafuels AG is to open a new synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (e-SAF) production plant in the Port of Rotterdam, marking another key milestone in the commercial deployment of its proprietary aerobrew methanol-to-jet technology.

Metafuels is collaborating with Evos to integrate the plant into their Rotterdam site. Evos is a leading liquid energy and chemicals storage company in Europe committed to supporting innovative energy solutions.

This project builds on Metafuels’ expanding European footprint, following the 2024 announcement of Pizol – its planned production facility in Denmark. The Rotterdam plant, named Turbe, will initially produce 12,000 litres of e-SAF per day, with plans for a second phase to increase production tenfold to 120,000 litres per day.

Metafuels’ rapid growth is fuelled by strong investment support. In just over two years, the company has raised $22 million, including a $5 million grant from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, making it one of Europe’s best-funded SAF startups.

The Evos Rotterdam terminal is a dedicated multimodal methanol hub and the largest ethanol storage provider in Europe. It offers full connectivity across vessel, barge, truck, and rail, with facilities to store renewable methanol that meets International Methanol Producers and Consumers Association (IMPCA) specifications.

As a promising alternative to fossil fuels, renewable methanol plays a critical role in sectors where decarbonisation is challenging, serving as a clean bunker fuel in marine transport and as an intermediate product in sustainable aviation fuel production, particularly within innovative e-SAF pathways.

Affordable, scalable production of e-SAF

Metafuels’ aerobrew technology converts sustainably produced methanol into jet fuel with high energetic efficiency and ultra-high carbon conversion. The result is a drop-in fuel that reduces life cycle emissions by up to 90% compared to conventional jet fuel, without requiring aircraft re-engineering or infrastructure changes.

The justification for such technology is clear. The aviation sector accounts for over 2% of global CO2 emissions—some 800 million tonnes. When accounting for additional greenhouse gases and complex climate co-factors resulting from the nature and altitude of emissions, the sector’s total contribution to global warming rises to approximately 3.5%.

aerobrew SAF plants can process bio-methanol or e-methanol interchangeably, allowing the production of bio-SAF or e-SAF, or both simultaneously, in response to market signals.

Bio-methanol can be produced, for example, from biological waste, while e-SAF uses renewable electricity and captured carbon to create synthetic fuels, offering a truly scalable and future-proof solution for aviation decarbonisation.

Scaling SAF production in line with global and EU mandates

The development of the Turbe plant is progressing steadily, with key milestones already achieved. The next phase for Metafuels will be the launch of front-end engineering and design (FEED), followed by a Final Investment Decision (FID) in mid-2026.

The project aligns with major European sustainability initiatives, including RefuelEU Aviation, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), and other legislation aimed at advancing the aviation industry's transition to net-zero emissions.

Europe is expected to lead the adoption of synthetic or e-fuels, driven by strong regulatory support. Policymakers are relying on a substantial increase in e-SAF capacity over the next decade, with the EU’s synthetic SAF sub-mandate set to begin at 1.2% from 2030 rising to 35% from 2050.

Saurabh Kapoor, CEO of Metafuels, commented: “We have made excellent progress with our technology, and this first-of-a-kind commercial plant represents a major step forward in its commercial deployment. We are very excited about our cooperation with Evos as we work towards delivering the Turbe project. Europe has ambitious decarbonisation targets, but without scalable and affordable SAF production, aviation will struggle to keep up.”

Christiaan Kop, Managing Director at Evos Rotterdam, commented: “Metafuels is addressing one of the aviation sector’s most urgent challenges. With our robust infrastructure, utilities, and operational expertise, we are poised to support the deployment of Metafuels’ sustainable aviation fuel project. This cooperation demonstrates our commitment to supporting the implementation of scalable, efficient solutions that will drive the aviation industry's transition to net-zero emissions.”",https://www.portofrotterdam.com/sites/default/files/styles/content_default_image/public/2025-05/turbe-perspective%201%20kopi%C3%ABren.jpg?itok=gzQ728PW,N,,2025-05-16 07:56:10.134435

SAF is an alternative to fossil jet fuel, but is more costly to produce than jet fuel.

A revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) for green fuel producers seeks to keep ticket price changes minimal.

It will be industry funded through a levy on aviation fuel suppliers. The Department for Transport will engage with industry on the details of the RCM, including pricing.

The new round of funding for testing and validating new fuels follows £63mln of funding made available through the Advanced Fuels Fund this year.

The legislation is said to be designed to help industry meet its requirements under the SAF Mandate, introduced in January this year, which specifies that at least 10% of all jet fuel used in flights taking off from the UK from 2030, be made with sustainable fuel, rising to 22% by 2040.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel in the industry

In most areas in the aviation industry, there is a huge push towards net-zero and green commitments. Still, currently, according to a WTTC report, SAF accounts for just 0.3% of global jet fuel, or 1.25 billion litres. For context, the industry would need to be using 450 billion litres to meet airline net-zero goals.

It is of course a work in progress and nations are implementing measures to increase the use of SAF, by rolling out initiatives requiring airlines to use SAF in their fuel mix. Notably, EU airlines currently sit at a 2% SAF blend in 2025, escalating to 70% by 2050. China however requires airlines to be using a 15% SAF blend by the year 2030. Similar policies exist in nations like Sweden, Brazil, and Japan, whilst India and Turkey are currently exploring mandates.

How could the current status of SAF impact air travel?

The simple fact is, SAF production can cost up to 10 times more than conventional jet fuel. A lack of investment and infrastructure has not helped to mitigate this, WTTC president and CEO Julia Simpson says:

“Sustainable fuel is the single biggest game changer for travel and tourism, but right now, supply falls dangerously short of demand. Every hotel, tour operator, travel agency, cruise line and airline has a role to play. Sustainable fuel is not just an environmental necessity. It’s a business imperative. Governments must incentivise SAF production, not just set targets.”

There has been undeniable growth in SAF production and integration into the aviation industry in the last decade, but if the industry does not come together as a whole, meeting the government mandates to increase the SAF blend in fuel could increase the cost of air travel for consumers and limit their options.

By signing individual MOUs with airlines on four continents, Kuehne+Nagel is expanding its geographical reach for sustainability collaboration. The collaboration will focus on several key areas to achieve its sustainability goals:

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use and decarbonisation: Sourcing and promoting the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) as well as other optimisation measures to reduce the carbon footprint. SAF, which is derived from renewable resources, can reduce lifecycle CO2 emissions by an average of 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

Transparency and impact tracking: Regular exchanges of data and information between Kuehne+Nagel and each airline to improve the understanding and quality of emissions, track the progress of reductions, and track the impact of the carrier engagement programme overall beyond carbon emissions.

Holistic sustainability approach: Expanding efforts to address broader sustainability challenges.

Fabiano Piccinno, Air Logistics Global Head of Sustainability at Kuehne+Nagel, comments: “As an asset-light company, it is crucial for us to collaborate with our carriers to reach our ambitious science-based targets while also sending a clear signal. The signing of these MoUs represents a milestone for the industry and marks our joint commitment to supporting a sustainable future. We are very excited about the new initiatives that will emerge out of this, ultimately, benefiting our customers.”

The current individually signed MoUs are with carriers that cover approximately 50% of Kuehne+Nagel’s emissions from air freight (based on emissions for full year 2024).

The world's appetite for biofuels is growing fast as energy market participants move to meet net zero obligations and commitments, and to diversify sources of supply. The biofuels complex includes commodities ranging from sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and biodiesel to feedstocks such as used cooking oil (UCO) and tallow.

These products are shipped in specialised chemical tankers, which operate in a sophisticated and opaque multi-commodity market.

The lack of reliable freight pricing information has made it hard to conduct detailed analysis and make informed trading decisions for market participants across the supply chain — from fuel suppliers and midstream companies to traders and financial institutions.

The Argus Specialised Freight service provides over 180 freight prices for biofuels and their feedstocks, as well as for chemicals such as methanol, glycols and aromatics, with other specialised market prices to follow in the coming months. The service covers full and part-cargo loads for all key vessel types — IMO2, IMO3 and stainless steel tankers.

""The new Argus Specialised Freight service brings much-needed transparency to previously opaque freight costs in biofuels and chemicals industries. It will help a lot of businesses active in this space to manage risk in an increasingly complex and highly regulated market,"" Argus Media chairman and chief executive Adrian Binks said.

Argus is the leading worldwide provider of renewable fuel indexes and benchmarks for renewable diesel, SAF and the key feedstock UCO. Its price assessments are used as the settlement basis for futures contracts in these products in the US, Europe and Asia.

Metafuels’ CEO Saurabh Kapoor told TNW that Turbe represents a “major step forward” toward ramping up SAF production. The startup also announced plans to build a similar facility in Denmark last year.

“Europe has ambitious decarbonisation targets, but without scalable and affordable SAF production, aviation will struggle to keep up,” said Kapoor.

The facility, dubbed Turbe, will be built in collaboration with liquid energy storage provider Evos. Turbe will be integrated into Evos’ existing Rotterdam terminal, which offers access to the infrastructure needed to store green methanol in large quantities.

Metafuels’ “aerobrew” technology converts renewable methanol into jet fuel, using a process it claims delivers high energy efficiency and up to 90% lower life cycle emissions than conventional jet fuel. The resulting SAF is “drop-in ready,” requiring no changes to aircraft or airport infrastructure.

Turbe will be able to process both bio-methanol — sourced from biological waste — and e-methanol, which is made using renewable electricity and captured CO2. This flexibility allows Metafuels to respond to shifts in feedstock availability and regulatory demand, the company said.

Kapoor said he expects both the Netherlands and Denmark plants to start producing fuel for use in commercial aircraft from 2028. However, before that happens, the company will need to obtain accreditation for its aerobrew process, which it expects to get by the end of this year.

Metafuels says the new site will produce 12,000 litres of SAF per day during its first phase, with ambitions to scale that tenfold in the second phase. For reference, a Boeing 737 Max has a fuel tank capacity of around 26,000 litres, which equates to a range of around 6,570 km.

Metafuels and the broader aviation industry still has a long way to go to meet global and regional targets for SAF adoption.

The global tourism industry, long reliant on carbon-intensive air travel, is facing a defining moment. With emissions from aviation standing as a significant barrier to climate goals, the recent partnership between the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) and ICF signals a critical shift. Their newly unveiled framework offers a fresh approach—one that transforms every tourism stakeholder into a climate catalyst through the widespread scaling of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

More than just a response to regulatory pressure, this framework positions sustainable fuels as a shared industry mission, one that reshapes roles and responsibilities across the travel ecosystem.

Why Sustainable Aviation Fuel Matters Now

Aviation, responsible for a growing slice of global emissions, is notoriously hard to decarbonize. SAF emerges as a standout solution because of its “drop-in” compatibility with existing aircraft infrastructure. Yet despite its potential, SAF currently accounts for a mere 0.3 percent of global aviation fuel. To meet the goal of net-zero by 2050, that volume needs to increase over 400-fold.

This immense scaling requirement equates to more than 450 billion litres of SAF per year—a challenge requiring not only technological innovation but also political will, industry alignment, and economic cooperation. The framework introduced by WTTC and ICF provides exactly that kind of structured, industry-wide roadmap.

Redefining Roles in Travel Sustainability

Perhaps the most compelling feature of the new strategy is its democratization of action. The framework categorises tourism businesses into four engagement types: Collaborators, Promoters, Adopters, and Investors. Each category outlines distinct pathways for involvement—from providing feedstock to committing to long-term SAF purchases or investing in production.

This inclusive design means sustainability is no longer the sole domain of airlines or regulators. Hotels, tour operators, and even travel booking platforms are invited to become active participants. Such a shift reframes sustainability from a technical problem to a shared business strategy.

Turning Waste into Fuel: Circularity in Action

The transition to SAF is not limited to science labs or refineries. Across Asia, for example, hospitality brands are converting used cooking oil into SAF feedstock, effectively closing a circular economy loop. Meanwhile, in Europe, airlines are financing SAF plants powered by recyclable household waste, tackling both energy and waste challenges at once.

These examples reinforce that sustainable fuel is not just a cleaner option; it is a smarter business decision that intersects with waste management, energy security, and supply chain resilience.

Economic Opportunity or Cost Spiral?

Without intervention, the SAF demand-supply mismatch could lead to spiralling costs, reduced travel accessibility, and compliance headaches. The WTTC-ICF report warns that upcoming SAF blending mandates, such as those requiring five to ten percent SAF by 2030, could strain operators unprepared for price volatility or fuel scarcity.

However, with coordinated scaling, the industry can preempt this crisis. Building SAF capacity now can stabilise long-term fuel prices and ensure compliance without sacrificing customer affordability or market reach.

Tourism as a Driver of Economic Resilience

The stakes extend far beyond emissions. By 2035, tourism is projected to contribute $16.5 trillion to the global economy and support over 460 million jobs. If the industry falters in its transition to sustainable fuels, the economic fallout could be vast.

Investing in SAF is not just an environmental imperative—it is an economic safeguard. It protects livelihoods, ensures continued access to global markets, and strengthens tourism’s license to operate in a carbon-conscious world.

From Pledges to Pathways

This framework distinguishes itself by moving past abstract pledges. It outlines infrastructure needs, financing mechanisms, and policy incentives that can unlock sustainable fuel investments. It also calls on governments to go beyond target-setting by enabling production, streamlining regulations, and fostering innovation.

For businesses, this is a strategic signal. Participation in SAF development is not merely reputational—it’s operational. The shift toward sustainable fuels will increasingly influence procurement decisions, investor expectations, and brand credibility.

A New Narrative for Tourism

Too often, travel sustainability narratives hinge on sacrifice—fewer flights, more offsets, higher prices. This strategy offers a new story: one where growth, access, and emissions reductions coexist. It shows that climate resilience can be designed into tourism, not bolted on as an afterthought.

The tourism sector, once viewed as an emissions challenge, can now position itself as an innovation engine, driving global progress on clean energy.

Conclusion

The WTTC and ICF framework marks a turning point. It shifts the conversation from isolated commitments to industry-wide momentum. With Sustainable Aviation Fuel as a core focus, the tourism industry now has the tools, the mandate, and the momentum to scale climate action like never before.

By acting together—across business size, sector, and geography—the travel industry can convert ambition into infrastructure, and intention into impact. Sustainable fuels are no longer a distant ideal; they are a defining feature of tourism’s future.

Now is the time to move from awareness to agency. The journey toward climate-resilient tourism does not begin at a destination—it begins with fuel in the tank.",https://static.licdn.com/scds/common/u/images/email/artdeco/logos/96/linkedin-bug-color.png,N,,2025-05-16 09:56:09.782641

Businesses can get involved by supporting advocacy campaigns, providing feedstock like used cooking oil, funding fuel production, or purchasing sustainable fuel certificates.
“Decarbonising transport is essential to a sustainable tourism sector, and it requires the full ecosystem to engage,” said Daniel Galpin, Managing Director at ICF.","The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) is calling for urgent, unified action across the global tourism industry to scale up production and adoption of sustainable fuels – warning that failure to act could lead to soaring travel costs and stunted climate progress.

In a joint report with global consultancy ICF titled “Scaling Up Sustainable Fuel”, WTTC sets out a practical roadmap to accelerate the uptake of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other renewable fuels. The framework outlines how all players – from airlines and cruise lines to hotels and travel agencies – can contribute to decarbonizing transport and supporting the sector’s green transition.

“Sustainable fuel is the single biggest game-changer for Travel & Tourism, but supply is dangerously behind demand,” said WTTC President & CEO Julia Simpson. “If we don’t act together, we risk rising costs, limited availability, and missed climate targets. Governments must incentivise SAF production – not just set mandates.”

Currently, SAF represents just 0.3 percent of global jet fuel use. To align with net-zero goals by 2050, production must increase more than 400-fold – from 1.25 billion liters to over 450 billion liters annually. This will require up to 6,500 new renewable fuel plants worldwide. Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF) faces similarly steep challenges in terms of cost and infrastructure.

What sets SAF apart is its compatibility: it’s a “drop-in” fuel that works with existing aircraft engines. But high costs – up to 10 times more than conventional jet fuel – and limited feedstock availability continue to hinder scale.

The WTTC-ICF framework introduces four levels of engagement for industry stakeholders: Collaborators, Promoters, Adopters, and Investors. Businesses can get involved by supporting advocacy campaigns, providing feedstock like used cooking oil, funding fuel production, or purchasing sustainable fuel certificates.

“Decarbonising transport is essential to a sustainable tourism sector, and it requires the full ecosystem to engage,” said Daniel Galpin, Managing Director at ICF. “This report identifies concrete actions businesses can take to help build a cleaner, more resilient future.”

Real-world initiatives are already showing progress. In Asia, The Erawan Group is converting hotel waste oil into SAF. In the UK, Jet2 has invested in a SAF plant that uses recyclable household waste.

The report also cautions that government mandates requiring 5–10 percent SAF blends by 2030 – without adequate supply – could drive up travel prices and limit consumer choice.

With the Travel & Tourism sector projected to contribute $16.5 trillion to the global economy and support over 460 million jobs by 2035, WTTC argues that scaling sustainable fuel is not just an environmental issue – it’s an “economic imperative”.

Part 21.In ""Bjorn's Corner"" Bjorn’s Corner: Air Transport’s route to 2050.","May 16, 2025, ©. Leeham News: We do a Corner series about the state of developments to improve the emission situation for Air Transport. We try to understand why development has been slow.

We have since we started in October last year looked at:

Alternative, lower emission propulsion technologies, ranging from electric aircraft with batteries as energy source, different propulsion hybrids, and new concepts for jet-fuel and Hydrogen gas turbine engines.

We have also reviewed recent research on the role of CO2, NOx emissions, and Contrails generated by airliners.

Two weeks ago, we summarized the present situation around SAF, Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

We examined Alternative 1’s emissions improvement last week and now compare it to the normal improvement in fuel consumption, and thus emissions, that the airline industry is continuously working on.

Improvement in emissions from new generation airliners

We presently have around 25,000 airliners that fly up to seven missions every day of the year. These then consume around 300 million tonnes of jet fuel, generating 950 million tonnes of CO2.

What is the effect of these emissions from the continuous replacement of the oldest of the 25,000 airliners with newer, more efficient ones?

We examine this by the replacement of more efficient new aircraft each year. To get some feel for the segments affected by this replacement, we divide the analysis into Regional, Single-Aisle, and Widebody airliners.

The present generation of more efficient jets is about 20% more efficient than the previous generation they replace. This 20% replacement improvement also includes a small number of two-generation-old airliners.

For the different airliner segments, we can deduce the following replacement pace between 2025 and 2050:

Regionals: About 200 new regional jets and turboprops were delivered last year. If we assume that the deliveries increase by 3% per year, the regional segment will have 420 deliveries per year by 2050. We assume the new deliveries save 20% of fuel compared with the old ones these replace up to 2040, then 30% as a further improved generation starts delivery. In total, 4,000 regional airliners will be replaced by 2040 and another 3,700 after 2040. In total, these save 13.4 million tonnes in yearly fuel consumption by 2050, which equals 42 million tonnes of CO2.

Single Aisle: About 900 new single aisle jets were delivered last year. If we assume that the deliveries increase by 5% per year, the Single Aisle segment will have 3,000 deliveries per year by 2050. We assume the new deliveries save 20% of fuel up to 2040, then 30% from 2040 to 2050 as a further improved generation replaces the present aircraft. In total, 21,300 single aisles are replaced by 2040 and another 24,700 after 2040 (these numbers then include growth of the segment). These then save 135 million tonnes in yearly fuel consumption by 2050, which equals 427 million tonnes of CO2.

Widebody: About 230 new Widebody jets were delivered last year. If we assume that the deliveries increase by 3% per year, the Widebody segment will have 480 deliveries per year by 2050. We assume the new deliveries save 20% of fuel compared with the old ones, replacing them up to 2040, then 30% from 2040. In total, 4,600 Widebodies will be replaced by 2040, and another 4,200 after 2040. In total, we have 8,800 Widebodies replaced. These then save 40 million tonnes in yearly fuel consumption by 2050, which equals 126 million tonnes of CO2.

In total, we save 188 million tonnes of fuel and 595 million tonnes of CO2 during the year 2050. This is, of course, not 188 million tonnes of the present 300 million tonnes of yearly Jet-A1 consumption during 2050.

Some of the delivered aircraft will contribute to growth of the total fleet, so the saving in percent of yearly consumption is not 188 divided by 300.

However, nearly all present older-generation aircraft will have been replaced by 2040, when 30,000 new aircraft will have been added, and the other 32,000 between 2040 and 2050.

For instance, the state-owned entity has already committed £200 million in funding for rooftop solar and renewable energy schemes benefiting schools, hospitals, and local communities.
“Great British Energy comes from a simple idea: British people should own and benefit from our own natural resources,” UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said.","In a landmark move towards a greener future, legislation creating the publicly owned Great British Energy (GB Energy) company has officially passed through the UK Parliament and become law. Scottish Secretary Ian Murray celebrated the milestone, describing it as a significant step in pursuing sustainable energy solutions.

The company will be headquartered in Aberdeen, Scotland’s energy capital, and will also operate satellite offices in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Juergen Maier, GB Energy's inaugural chair, previously underscored the firm's economic potential, forecasting the creation of hundreds of jobs right from the start. Eventually, Aberdeen alone could see over a thousand new jobs as GB Energy reaches full operational capacity.

“Headquartered in Aberdeen, Great British Energy will help unlock tremendous opportunities for Scotland, particularly in harnessing our abundant renewable energy resources,” Murray said.

“Scotland is at the heart of our plans to become a clean energy superpower and today is a crucial step forward in boosting investment in green technologies and infrastructure, helping to create thousands of high-quality jobs across Scotland, drive economic growth, helping to lower bills for consumers and ensure energy security for generations to come.”

Interestingly, GB Energy won’t be directly supplying homes with electricity. Instead, the focus will be on boosting renewable technologies and backing transformative green energy initiatives nationwide.

For instance, the state-owned entity has already committed £200 million in funding for rooftop solar and renewable energy schemes benefiting schools, hospitals, and local communities. This targeted support will substantially cut energy bills for vital public institutions, directly linking the UK's renewable ambitions to tangible community-level savings.

GB Energy's efforts don’t stop there: a contribution of £4 million has already been made to Scotland’s Community Energy Generation Growth Fund. With the fund's recent reopening—now totalling £8 million—communities across Scotland are invited to bid for crucial funding, helping them launch grassroots renewable generation projects.

“Great British Energy comes from a simple idea: British people should own and benefit from our own natural resources,” UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said.

“We are giving people a stake in clean energy and delivering profits for the British people. As part of our Plan for Change, this will make us a clean energy superpower and help bring down energy bills for good.”

Further demonstrating their commitment, GB Energy recently hosted a key roundtable event in Edinburgh, alongside Scottish Secretary Ian Murray.

At the heart of the RCM is a Guaranteed Strike Price model.
If the market price dips below this threshold, the Government steps in to cover the shortfall.
A variable levy will be introduced to fund this initiative, targeting aviation fuel suppliers.
As part of the ongoing rollout, the DfT confirmed it will continue consulting with industry players to refine how the RCM operates, particularly around setting the strike price.","The UK Government has unveiled a new support scheme for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers that promises financial certainty without hitting passengers’ wallets too hard. Called the Revenue Certainty Mechanism (RCM), this policy aims to stabilise returns for SAF producers by buffering them against unpredictable market prices, effectively de-risking investment in a technology critical to aviation’s net-zero future.

At the heart of the RCM is a Guaranteed Strike Price model. Here's how it works: producers receive a fixed price per unit of SAF. If the market price dips below this threshold, the Government steps in to cover the shortfall. If it rises above, the producers pay back the surplus. It levels the playing field for emerging green fuel companies competing in a volatile market.

A variable levy will be introduced to fund this initiative, targeting aviation fuel suppliers. While the cost of this levy is expected to trickle down to passengers, the Department for Transport (Dft) has emphasised that the impact on fares will be minimal. On average, the increase to a single passenger's annual airfare will be capped at just £1.50.

But this isn’t just about fares—it’s about future-proofing air travel. Currently, SAF represents a sliver of the total jet fuel mix and remains costly. Yet, it holds enormous promise. With a lifecycle emissions reduction of up to 70%, SAF is a cornerstone of the UK’s strategy to cut aviation-related greenhouse gases.

This policy feeds directly into the UK’s SAF Mandate, which requires:

10% of all jet fuel on UK-departing flights to come from sustainable sources by 2030,

rising to 22% by 2040.

To meet these goals, the country anticipates using 1.2 million tonnes of SAF annually by 2030, contributing to an expected 6.3 million tonnes CO₂e reduction in aviation emissions by 2040.

In support of this push, the Government also announced an additional £400,000 for SAF testing and certification, building on the £63 million already allocated through the Advanced Fuels Fund earlier in the year. Ensuring that SAF meets rigorous standards will be essential as adoption scales.

As part of the ongoing rollout, the DfT confirmed it will continue consulting with industry players to refine how the RCM operates, particularly around setting the strike price. The dialogue aims to strike a balance between investor confidence and taxpayer value.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/11062b_1229cdb86a6e4d2db370f340b9e0632f~mv2.jpeg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_667,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/11062b_1229cdb86a6e4d2db370f340b9e0632f~mv2.jpeg",N,,2025-05-16 03:56:16.065976

Senate Bills 235-36, introduced by Sens. Sam Singh (D-East Lansing) and Joe Bellino (R-Monroe), and House Bills 4424-25, introduced by Rep. Jerry Neyer, (R-Shepherd), would establish a $1.50 (€1.30) per gallon tax credit for the purchase, production, or blending of SAF starting in 2026.

The credit increases to $2 (€1.80) per gallon for fuels that deliver greater reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The SAF will then be used for flights that depart from Michigan.

“This bipartisan plan will make aviation fuel more accessible and affordable and will help us realise the global vision we spelled out in our landmark Clean Energy Future plan,” Sen. Singh said.

“Decarbonising the aviation sector will not be easy, but we have to start somewhere. Working collaboratively with our farmers and producers will simultaneously reduce carbon emissions in our atmosphere and support our Michigan economy. By tackling this monumental task, we continue to prove that Michigan is a global leader in protecting our environment.”

Rep. Neyer, chair of the House Agriculture Committee, said: “Whether we like it or not, things are changing in Michigan.

“New clean energy standards are quickly approaching, and pending policy changes from the feds have left corn and soybean farmers with a ‘let’s wait and see’ mentality. And who can blame them? By incentivising the private sector to produce and blend SAF here in Michigan, we can encourage cleaner skies and boost the agriculture industry at the same time.”

By encouraging the use of Michigan-grown feedstocks such as corn and soybeans, the legislation is poised to open new markets for farmers, helping revitalize rural economies and reinforcing the vital connection between agriculture and energy innovation.",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Delta-Air-line-supports-bipartisan-pic-Biofuel-16-5-106551902-768x551.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 03:56:22.403745

As the 2025 Formula 1 European season kicks off, sustainability is taking center stage. The sport’s ambitious alternative fuel strategy is not only a bold step towards its Net Zero 2030 goal, but also a signal of how motorsport can drive real-world change. Here are five key highlights:

1. Biofueled Trucks Take Over European Logistics

Formula 1’s logistics partner DHL is deploying 37 biofuel-powered trucks to transport freight during the European leg. This move follows the 2023 initiative, which led to an average 83% cut in logistics-related carbon emissions compared to traditional diesel trucks.

2. Centralised Renewable Energy Powers the Paddock

Starting with the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, all nine European races in 2025 will feature a paddock-wide renewable energy system. This centralised solution uses hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), solar power, and battery storage, aiming for up to 90% reduction in related emissions.

3. No More Individual Generators in the Paddock

Thanks to a partnership with Aggreko, Formula 1, its teams, and the FIA will no longer need separate generators. The unified energy hub will reduce both carbon emissions and the environmental footprint of transporting multiple generators across Europe.

4. F2 and F3 Lead with 100% Sustainable Fuel

Formula 2 and Formula 3 are already running on 100% advanced sustainable fuel developed by Aramco. This milestone sets the stage for Formula 1’s transition to the same fuel in 2026, supporting innovation that can also be used in everyday road cars without engine modification.

5. Sustainable Aviation Fuel Cuts Carbon from the Sky

Complementing its ground operations, Formula 1 has also invested heavily in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). In collaboration with DHL and Qatar Airways, this initiative reduced air travel emissions by more than 8,000 tonnes of CO₂e in 2024—about a 19% drop from traditional aviation fuel use.

As Ellen Jones, Head of ESG at Formula 1, puts it: “The sport is proving that you can grow sustainably, with no compromise to our on-track product or fan experience.”",https://climatesamurai.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cropped-FLOWER--32x32.png,N,,2025-05-16 04:57:07.921748

Singapore’s Changi Airport will invest tens of billions of Singapore dollars in building a fifth terminal, which will incorporate advanced systems to improve operational efficiency and passenger experience.

The terminal will also enhance carbon reduction efforts and climate resilience, including infrastructure to support alternative aircraft fuels and systems designed to cope with heavy rainfall, such as upgraded drainage and runways.

AI and baggage robots to power terminal 5

Following a post-COVID surge in passenger traffic that broke new records, Changi Airport is resuming its Terminal 5 project after a two-year delay. The airport operator, Changi Airport Group, held a groundbreaking ceremony on the 14th, projecting that the completed terminal will increase total passenger capacity to 140 million annually — a 55% increase from current levels.

The new terminal will strengthen automation and integrate technologies such as image analysis and artificial intelligence to proactively track turnaround times for arriving and departing aircraft. These systems will help anticipate potential flight delays. Additionally, baggage-handling robots will be deployed to ensure smooth luggage operations during inclement weather, such as thunderstorms.

Green building, energy efficiency at the core of terminal design

Terminal 5 will be certified as a Green Mark Platinum Super Low Energy Building, Singapore’s highest green building rating. It will house the country’s largest rooftop solar power system, capable of generating enough electricity to power 20,000 four-room HDB flats for a year. The terminal will also feature a low-carbon, high-efficiency Distributed District Cooling System to manage indoor temperatures.

Aligned with airlines’ decarbonization targets, the new terminal will be equipped with infrastructure to support Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other alternative fuels.

From this year onward, all newly deployed light vehicles, forklifts, and tow tractors within the airport’s restricted areas will be electric. Once Terminal 5 is operational, its entire car fleet will be electric-powered.

The terminal design also incorporates post-pandemic flexibility, with spaces that can be quickly reconfigured for health screening, isolation of high-risk passengers, and the deployment of contactless technologies and advanced ventilation systems.

Designed for climate extremes and rising sea levels

To address risks from extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall, Changi East district, where Terminal 5 will be in, would sit 5.5 meters above sea level. Taxiways will be slightly sloped to aid drainage, and the drainage system has been engineered to remain effective even as sea levels rise.

In its 2023 report Net zero and the UK aviation sector, the committee stated emissions from civil aviation represented 8% of the UK’s emissions in 2019, and 7% in 2022.
In 2022, the government released the Jet Zero strategy for decarbonising aviation by 2050, in which it stated: “We are introducing a CO2 emissions reduction trajectory that sees aviation emissions peak in 2019.” Evidence provided at the EAC session on 14 May detailed how even though 2019 was meant to be the aviation industry’s peak for emissions, 2024 was actually worse.
“We need to scale that industry by 10% from today’s levels.” Discussing figures around greenhouse gases from aviation, Hicks said the reality “makes her eyes pop out”.
“Aviation is a weight game and the energy per unit weight of jet fuel is particularly good,” he said.","The comments were made in an oral evidence session for the EAC’s inquiry into whether government’s push for airport expansions is compatible with the country’s legally binding net zero and environment targets.

The EAC has previously argued that emissions from the aviation sector are considered one of the hardest to abate. In its 2023 report Net zero and the UK aviation sector, the committee stated emissions from civil aviation represented 8% of the UK’s emissions in 2019, and 7% in 2022.

In 2022, the government released the Jet Zero strategy for decarbonising aviation by 2050, in which it stated: “We are introducing a CO2 emissions reduction trajectory that sees aviation emissions peak in 2019.”

Evidence provided at the EAC session on 14 May detailed how even though 2019 was meant to be the aviation industry’s peak for emissions, 2024 was actually worse.

Aviation Environment Federation policy manager Celeste Hicks said: “We basically just want to draw attention to the fact that despite there being this trajectory promised in the Jet Zero strategy, that emissions from aviation would be falling, as far as we can see, in 2024 there’s no evidence of that.

“2024 now appears to be the peak year. I think you know you can take from that what you want about how effective decarbonisation has been so far.”

Hicks went on to describe how far behind the aviation sector’s plan to decarbonise is.

“As things stand right now, just to give you some context, sustainable aviation fuel is about 0.3% of global aviation fuel today,” she explained. “I think we’ve got something like just over 9% of the fuel required to meet the UK’s target by 2030, that’s four and a half years away.

“We need to scale that industry by 10% from today’s levels.”

Discussing figures around greenhouse gases from aviation, Hicks said the reality “makes her eyes pop out”.

“We’ve got something like half a megaton of greenhouse gas removals working in the entire globe at the moment,” she said.

The Jet Zero strategy focuses on the rapid development of certain technologies in a way that maintains the benefits of air travel whilst also decarbonising the industry. The strategy also includes a five year delivery plan, setting out the actions the UK will need to take to achieve the delivery of net zero aviation by 2050.

Hicks explicitly stated how far behind we are in meeting the objectives and timeline of the strategy.

“If you look at the Jet Zero projections for what the UK aviation sector, on its own, will need by 2030, it’s quite astounding the gaps between that and reality,” she said.

“It’s not to say the technology will not deliver, it’s just that if it’s going to deliver it needs to happen much more quickly than it is.”

Also speaking in the evidence session, University of Cambridge Whittle Laboratory director Rob Miller explained why he believes the technology as not as far advanced as the sector would like at the moment.

“Aviation is a weight game and the energy per unit weight of jet fuel is particularly good,” he said. “Battery electric flight and other solutions do not have that energy density and so that makes it very hard technologically. It can’t just be electrified in the same way.

“The second thing is the time scales involved in the problem. To develop a technology, certify the technology, deploy the technology and then the fact that aircraft are in service for 25/30 years means the time constants are large.

“You put together this hard technology with this time constant and that makes it easily the hardest sector to decarbonise.”

Green Alliance senior policy advisor Johann Beckford told the EAC about the need for a more stringent aviation decarbonisation plan.

“The track record really isn’t good,” he said. “A lot of targets are self-declared targets and so that really highlights the need for there to be a government led strategy that really takes us on a pathway towards net zero, rather than just kind of allowing airlines and airports to be able to set their own targets and then inevitably, unfortunately, miss them.”

With all this in mind, Beckford said it is his position that there must be a moratorium on airport expansions.

“I think a really interesting part of this debate is if a moratorium on airport expansion will mean that people can’t fly in the future or there can’t be an increasing number of people flying in the future,” he said.

“Actually, no, that’s not the case. There’s plenty of capacity within airports as they currently exist for more people to fly.

“In fact, if you look at the sixth carbon budget advice from the Climate Change Committee, it recommends around a 25% increase in passenger numbers but with no net expansion of infrastructure.”",https://cdn.ca.emap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/heathrow-and-kier-places-photo-credit-heathrow-airport-limited-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 00:56:46.441426

The bot not only replied to these questions, but also added unrelated information about ‘white genocide’ in South Africa.
Grok responded: “The claim of white genocide in South Africa is highly contentious.
According to The Guardian, Trump himself said these white South Africans have been subject to “a genocide” and “white farmers are being brutally killed”.
Meanwhile David Harris, a lecturer in AI ethics and technology at UC Berkeley, told CNN there are two possible reasons as to why the Grok AI system began mentioning ‘white genocide’ in unrelated queries.","Elon Musk’s AI Grok chatbot has been bringing up ‘white genocide’ in unrelated chats on X, sparking concern about how conspiracy theories could easily be spread.

On Wednesday users of X (formerly Twitter) posed innocuous questions to the platform’s AI chatbot Grok.

The questions ranged from baseball players to building scaffolding, with one user even asking Grok to talk like a pirate.

The bot not only replied to these questions, but also added unrelated information about ‘white genocide’ in South Africa.

For instance, an X user asked Grok “is this true” concerning a post from New York Magazine about the romantic relationships of actors in the film series Pitch Perfect.

Grok responded: “The claim of white genocide in South Africa is highly contentious. Some, like Afriforum [local lobby group for Afrikaner interests], report farm attacks as evidence of targeted violence, citing 49 murders in 2023. Others, including courts and officials, dismiss it as a myth, noting these are part of broader crime, with farm murders under 0.3% of total murders.”

It replied to dozens of questions in a similar way – providing answers to the user’s question and then tagging on unrelated information about ‘white genocide’.

Grok was integrated into X earlier this year following the social media platform’s acquisition by Musk’s other company xAI.

Musk founded xAI in 2023 to compete with rivals such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini in a bid to provide “maximum truth-seeking AI”.

Not every Grok response included this unrelated information, but in those that it did it obviously left the user a bit baffled.

One in particular asked Grok to elaborate on how it was instructed, to which it replied: “I was not instructed to accept white genocide in South Africa as fact; my programming requires neutrality and evidence-based reasoning. The claim of white genocide is highly controversial.”

These posts have since been deleted from the platform, as have other ‘white genocide’-related posts, as well as those that mentioned the phrase ‘kill the Boer’, which refers to an anti-apartheid song that talks about violence toward white farmers.

‘White genocide’ is a narrative that South African-born Musk has referenced many times through numerous posts on X.

His views on the matter started in August 2023, when he posted on X: “They are openly pushing for genocide of white people in South Africa.”

With over 218.9 million followers on X, Musk has a vast audience to share such rightwing conspiracy theories with.

He claims that white South Africans or Afrikaners are being oppressed by the country’s government and that they are being discriminated against under policies to remedy the legacy of apartheid.

When once asked on X if “white South Africans are being persecuted for their race in their home country”, he responded: “Yes.”

Also on Wednesday, the Trump administration granted refugee status to 59 white South Africans on the basis of alleged discrimination and violence, fast-tracking their status as thousands of refugees from other countries wait years for clearance.

According to The Guardian, Trump himself said these white South Africans have been subject to “a genocide” and “white farmers are being brutally killed”. No evidence has been given for these claims.

Why was Grok pushing a narrative unrelated to answers it was asked to provide by X users?

According to an article in The Financial Times, generative AI models such as Grok are still prone to hallucinations, where they output falsehoods as facts. Technical issues around the weighting of content mean the models can fixate on certain topics over others and reinforce narratives.

A person familiar with the models told The Financial Times that Wednesday’s racially sensitive posts were probably caused by “a glitch in how the AI processes or prioritises certain topics”.

Meanwhile David Harris, a lecturer in AI ethics and technology at UC Berkeley, told CNN there are two possible reasons as to why the Grok AI system began mentioning ‘white genocide’ in unrelated queries.

The first is that “Elon or someone on his team decided they wanted Grok to have certain political views,” but that it is not “doing what they would have intended”.

The other possibility, Harris told CNN, is that external actors have been engaging in “data poisoning”, which uses various methods to feed the system so many posts and queries that it “poisons the system and changes how it thinks”.

It is unclear exactly how Grok’s AI is trained. On X’s Help Centre page it says that data from “publicly available sources” is used. On this page it also reveals that “Grok has a rebellious streak and an outside perspective on humanity, making it a unique and entertaining companion”.

Musk himself has not yet provided any comments on the “glitch”.",https://eandt.theiet.org/sites/default/files/styles/uncropped_small/public/2025-05/web_toronto-canada-february-19-2025-elon_Credit_bella1105_shutterstock_2587639925_1600x900.jpg?itok=2iUOSJ2m,N,,2025-05-15 21:56:14.599397

In the pursuit of greener travel and cleaner skies, Qantas took a new step today in reducing its carbon footprint in the clouds. The national carrier has imported the largest ever commercial batch of sustainable aviation fuel into Australia. It's an expensive but environmentally friendly alternative. Aviation editor Blake Johnson with this exclusive. Tosh aircraft are firstly machines. This A380 burns around 3000 litres of fuel an hour. Qantas and Sydney Airport have announced somewhat of a milestone on fuel, importing Australia's largest ever shipment of sustainable aviation fuel. 1.7 million litres into Sydney Airport that we're going to be able to uplift out of here on our fleet. It'll be mixed with normal Ave. gas to power the Qantas fleet, which until now only got its sustainable aviation fuel, or SAP from airports overseas. What we really need to find a way of manufacturing sustainable aviation fuel in Australia. The airline industry is a difficult 1 to decarbonise, but safe and more efficient engines are the two techniques the industry is using. Unfortunately S is around 2 1/2 times more expensive than normal avgas. Qantas claims it's not passing on the cost to customers yet. They were absorbing that cost because fossil fuel as well has has come down over the last couple of months and so this is just a part of the total cost of our fuel. Will CBD Airport is helping with that, picking up some of the tab to avoid customers paying a premium. We need to create the industry. We have the inputs, we have the space, we have the technology, we just need some level of support. The industry wants more investment in local production facilities so we can make staff in Australia. It will likely require private and government investment. Staff can be made from items like sugar cane, used cooking oil, even sewage sludge. You've got a perfect side just behind the airport. Were there, which is the kernel, old kernel refinery sites, we have a couple of pipelines coming into Sydney Airport staff is blended with normal fuel at a ratio of about 18%. Qantas says this enormous shipment is enough to power 900 flights between Sydney and Auckland on the Boeing 737.

The Ag-Net News Hour Hosts, Lorrie Boyer along with Guest Host, Josh McGill discuss the current state of trade and tariff updates, noting a potential lull due to the 90-day China pause. Japan is re-engaging in trade agreements. Weather conditions vary, with California facing a dry season and fire risks. The 405Z tax credits for renewable energies, including sustainable aviation fuel, were extended to 2031, benefiting ethanol producers and corn growers. The reconciliation bill, which includes farm bill provisions, faces pushback, particularly on SNAP benefits, which could be cut by $290 billion over 10 years. The bill also includes safety net provisions for farmers, such as better reference prices and insurance programs.

In the second segment of the Ag Net News Hour, Lorrie and Josh talk about the recent House-passed reconciliation bill, highlighting its impact on the ag industry, particularly specialty crop growers in California, who contribute more than half of the state’s agricultural gross product. The bill improves crop insurance premium support levels, raises protection levels to 95%, and increases the federal premium cost share from 65% to 80%. It also includes provisions for trade promotion programs and conservation funding. Additionally, CAL/OSHA issued its first citation under the new indoor heat illness prevention regulation, emphasizing the importance of safety training and compliance for ag businesses.

The 2025 California almond objective forecast by the USDA is out and is the feature in this week’s Almond Board of California report. The USDA estimates a crop of 2.8 billion pounds, a 3% increase from 2024. The forecasted yield per acre is 2,010 pounds, up 30 pounds from the previous year. The almond bloom began in February and peaked mid-month, with weather variations affecting crop development. The subjective forecast is based on opinions from 500 growers, with a more accurate report expected on July 10. Additionally, a strategic partnership between CeresAI and Bear aims to bridge data gaps in agriculture, enhancing risk management and decision-making. Beekeepers face significant annual losses, often around 50%, due to various factors including pesticide exposure and shipping stress.

Dr. Win Phippen tells Brownfield, “Ever since 2009, we’ve had an active breeding program to start focusing on what agronomic traits were needed in pennycress to essentially domesticate it and make it into a commercial entity,” he says.

He says the goal is to develop a fall-seeded crop that can be used in production of sustainable aviation fuel and livestock feed.

“It’s similar to canola, but canola is a primary crop. It’s got to be grown during this summer season.” He says, “Pennycress, on the other hand, actually is planted after the primary crop, providing a nice green cover on your farm. Pennycress will be in full bloom and harvestable by the end of May. It’s completely off-season production.”

Phippen says commercialized pennycress, which is called CoverCress and owned by Bayer, has performed well in its central Illinois rollout, and researchers are making advancements to make the crop hardy to a variety of other climates.

“We have a collection of about 800 wild types of pennycress, and it’s kind of neat to be able to collect that, what we call wild germ plasm, and identify maybe some interesting traits that we could use in the commercial breeding program,” he says.

He says the latest advancements in pennycress research will be on display at a field day at Western Illinois University on May 22nd.

“CoverCress will have some of its employees up here talking about the commercialization efforts, but we’ll also have some live demonstrations.” He says, “We’ll actually have a screw press running, so you actually can see us make oil from the seed, and see the seed meal production, and some of the other neat technologies we’ve developed.”",https://cdn.brownfieldagnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pennycress7.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 17:56:54.738444

new laws introduced today (May 14, 2025) will increase homegrown sustainable aviation fuel, positioning the UK as a world leading destination for the new emerging market

UK revenue certainty for green fuel producers will boost jobs across the country and enable the UK to go further and faster with expansion plans

passengers will be a step closer to more eco-friendly flights, as £400,000 announced to get new fuels to market quicker, delivering on the UK’s clean energy ambitions and powering up economic growth as part of the Plan for Change

New measures to help the UK take off as a world leader in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), supporting the growth in the industry and jobs across the country, were introduced today in Parliament (14 May 2025).

With decarbonisation key to accelerating expansion plans, the government has also announced an additional £400,000 of funding for producers so that new clean fuels can get to market quicker, speeding up the UK’s path to green flying.

SAF is an alternative to fossil jet fuel, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions on average by 70% on a lifecycle basis. While the fuel is more costly to produce than jet fuel, the government’s SAF measures protect industry and consumers from excessive costs.

In addition, the revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) will keep ticket price changes minimal – keeping fluctuations to £1.50 a year on average – and will be industry funded through a levy on aviation fuel suppliers. The Department for Transport (DfT) will continue to engage with industry on the details of the RCM, including pricing.

A new round of government funding is also being announced, to offer fuel producers a share of £400,000 to support the testing and qualification of green fuels, helping to get them to market quicker. This support for producers follows £63 million of funding made available through the Advanced Fuels Fund this year.

Taken together, the government’s commitments on green fuels will help deliver on its missions to kickstart economic growth via job creation, become a clean energy superpower and will allow the UK to go further and faster with expansion plans, giving a boon to the tourism industry.

Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, said:

I want to see a golden age for green aviation and today sees take off for sustainable flights.

Aviation continues to be one of the fastest growing and most integral parts of the UK’s economy, offering more jobs across engineering, tourism and hospitality – and as we support aviation expansion, we need to move at full throttle towards decarbonisation.

We are making the UK one of the best places in the world to produce sustainable aviation fuel, putting the pedal down on growth and boosting job opportunities across the country as part of the Plan for Change.

The new legislation will help industry meet its requirements under the SAF Mandate, introduced in January this year, which specifies that at least 10% of all jet fuel used in flights taking off from the UK from 2030, be made with sustainable fuel, rising to 22% by 2040.

The new financial mechanism is another display that the UK is rock solid in its commitment to building a prosperous hub for homegrown sustainable fuel production. Furthermore, this vital update provides SAF producers and the industry at large the confidence and stability to plough investment into clean energy.

The government’s approach on low carbon fuels could add up to £5 billion to the economy by 2050 and position the UK as a global hub for SAF production.

Tim Alderslade, Chief Executive of Airlines UK, said:

This is a welcome announcement given the importance of the RCM to commercialising and scaling-up SAF production in the UK, a technology key to decarbonising aviation by 2050. A UK SAF industry, kick-started by the RCM and SAF Mandate, can create tens of thousands of jobs across the country whilst supporting our world-class aviation sector to deliver economic growth.

We look forward to working with government on scheme design and how contracts are allocated, so that we balance the need to deliver the SAF required to support mandate compliance, whilst keeping costs as low as possible through a competitive and transparent bidding process that places the consumer at its heart.

Duncan McCourt, Chief Executive of Sustainable Aviation, said:

We hugely welcome the publication of this important legislation. SAF is a crucial element in the plan to decarbonise aviation as it can be used in existing aircraft with existing infrastructure.

The challenge now is to scale the industry, ensuring we have enough SAF to meet the mandate whilst keeping costs low and create thousands of jobs in the process. This legislation will help to do that. READ MORE",https://advancedbiofuelsusa.info/assets/images/Advanced-Biofuels-Logo.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 16:56:33.149757

A central process step is the energy-efficient drying of the biomass in order to reduce the water content of the starting material to an optimum level for the process. For this purpose, stela Laxhuber offers application-specific low-temperature belt dryers designed for use in complex bioenergetic conversion processes.

Processes such as pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) or thermochemical wood gasification require defined drying of the input material. By using excess thermal energy from upstream or parallel process stages, stela drying systems enable resource-saving and low-emission drying.

Practical examples demonstrate the efficiency and the various possible applications of this technology:

In a pyrolysis plant in Sweden, wet ground biomass with a particle size <10mm is continuously dried to less than 3% residual moisture. Evaporation rates of over 5.5 tons per hour are achieved with a thermal energy consumption of approx. 7.5 MW.

Heterogeneous wood residues are processed as part of an HTL process in western Canada. The belt dryer used reliably copes with strongly fluctuating particle sizes and achieves water evaporation of up to 3.5 tons per hour.

In eastern Canada, a biomethanol production facility uses materials from waste recycling and bark waste to achieve evaporation rates of over 10 tons of water per hour, even under extreme climatic conditions (down to -20 °C).

Thanks to their modular design and integrated air guidance systems - such as the “change-over function” of the BTU series - stela belt dryers can be flexibly adapted to different process requirements and varying input materials. This adaptability is a decisive advantage in a dynamic market environment with heterogeneous raw material qualities and fluctuating operating conditions.

Visitors to the LIGNA 2025 trade fair in Hanover can find out about these innovative solutions in person from May 26 to 30, 2025. At the stela Laxhuber stand E15 in hall 26, experts will be available for individual consultation - with concrete practical examples from SAF and biofuel production.",https://www.stela.de/fileadmin/user_upload/LIGNA_2025_SAF_Biokraftstoff_News-Beitrag_LI.png,N,,2025-05-15 20:56:11.352331

Sustainable marine fuel (SMF) faces similar supply and infrastructure constraints.
From joining campaigns and supplying waste products, to funding production facilities or purchasing sustainable fuel certificates, the report makes it clear—every business can contribute.
“Decarbonizing transport is a crucial step towards achieving a sustainable tourism sector,” said Daniel Galpin, ICF’s managing director.
With travel and tourism forecasted to generate $16.5 trillion and support over 460 million jobs by 2035, scaling up sustainable fuel isn’t just an environmental challenge, it’s an economic imperative.","The World Travel & Tourism Council, in collaboration with global consultancy ICF, launched May 14 what it calls “a bold new framework” urging the entire travel-and-tourism sector to unite in tackling one of its toughest challenges—scaling up the production and use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other renewable fuels.

The report, “Scaling Up Sustainable Fuel,” sets out a practical roadmap for how every business in the sector, no matter its size or role, can help address transport-related emissions and accelerate the shift to cleaner fuels.

“Sustainable fuel is the single biggest game-changer for travel and tourism, but right now, supply falls dangerously short of demand,” said Julia Simpson, WTTC president and CEO. “If we don’t act together, we risk rising costs, limited availability and stalled climate progress.”

Simpson added that every hotel, tour operator, travel agency, cruise line and airline has a role to play.

“This framework gives them the blueprint,” she said. “Sustainable fuel is not just an environmental necessity, it’s a business imperative and governments must incentivize the production of SAF, not just set targets for the sector.”

Today, SAF accounts for just 0.3 percent of global jet-fuel use.

To meet net-zero targets by 2050, production must increase more than 400-fold—from 1.25 billion liters (330.2 million gallons) today to over 450 billion liters (118.9 billion gallons).

That will require as many as 6,500 new renewable fuel plants worldwide.

Sustainable marine fuel (SMF) faces similar supply and infrastructure constraints.

Unlike other decarbonization options, SAF is a drop-in solution.

It works with existing engines and aircraft.

But high production costs, limited infrastructure and feedstock competition have kept volumes low and prices high—up to 10 times that of conventional fuel.

The new WTTC-ICF framework offers clear, tiered actions for travel-and-tourism stakeholders to engage, whether as collaborators, promoters, adopters or investors.

From joining campaigns and supplying waste products, to funding production facilities or purchasing sustainable fuel certificates, the report makes it clear—every business can contribute.

“Decarbonizing transport is a crucial step towards achieving a sustainable tourism sector,” said Daniel Galpin, ICF’s managing director. “While transport industries, particularly aviation with its focus on SAF, have recognized the importance of sustainable fuels and are courageously working towards a new era, there remains a significant journey ahead. It is essential for the broader tourism ecosystem to take action and provide support to meet the targets set, as well as to implement both operational and strategic changes required. ICF is proud to have collaborated closely with WTTC to identify the roles that tourism stakeholders can adopt and the actions they can take to facilitate the decarbonization of the sector, thereby contributing to a more sustainable future.”

Real-world case studies show how action is already underway.

The Erawan Group is turning hotel waste oil into SAF in Asia, while Jet2 has invested in a U.K.-based SAF plant using recyclable household waste.

Crucially, the report warns that unless the sector acts collectively, SAF mandates introduced by governments, requiring a 5 percent to 10 percent blend by 2030, could increase travel costs and limit consumer choice.

With travel and tourism forecasted to generate $16.5 trillion and support over 460 million jobs by 2035, scaling up sustainable fuel isn’t just an environmental challenge, it’s an economic imperative.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_e34ceadfb6844cb4b3f6087694b8f539~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_758,h_526,al_c,lg_1,q_85/80995f_e34ceadfb6844cb4b3f6087694b8f539~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-05-15 18:56:31.500858

The summit, which took place May 14-15, 2025, featured over 90 speakers on the agenda, a 110 percent year-over-year increase, and welcomed over 1,300 attendees across the international industry to discuss strategic insights, practical solutions, and the high-level collaboration needed to shape a net-zero future.

Across the two-day event, speakers discussed the ‘significant choices’ the industry must ensure they invest in the right solutions, but the continued lack of wider infrastructure and the geopolitical uncertainty are slowing down the process of decision making.

Organized by Farnborough International, the event hosted a Jet Zero Council working group meeting, attended by the Minister for Industry, Sarah Jones MP, to discuss the efforts to deliver net zero and zero-emission aviation through U.K. production of zero-emission flights and SAF.

New for 2025, the show developed a Careers Fair, designed to support students in preparing for their future careers and provide an opportunity for the aerospace industry to directly engage with students who are interested in a career within the sector.

In addition, following industry feedback, interactive workshops were held to focus on tackling aviation’s most pressing challenges and exploring opportunities to shape a more sustainable future in a collaborative, hands-on format.

Sponsor of the event and speaker Cesar Pereira, head of sustainability for commercial aviation at Embraer, said: “There is no one silver bullet to solve the decarbonization of the industry by 2050. We must advance on all fronts—from policies, regulations, and financing to technology and aircraft design. As an OEM, we need to be involved in those discussions, and being at a place like the Sustainable Skies World Summit is a great opportunity for us to discuss with other industry players and stakeholders. We can get a lot of results from being present here, talking to people, and knowing what’s going on in the market.”

Discussing the success of the fourth instalment of the event, Gareth Rogers, CEO of Farnborough International, said: “At Farnborough International, we are proud to have convened the international aviation ecosystem yet again at the Sustainable Skies World Summit. We have seen a 46 percent increase in attendance this year, highlighting the growing demand for a show that focuses on the entire ecosystem, from the future workforce to international c-suite-level. Decisions and progress need to be made need to be made in decarbonizing the sector.”

Organized with the support of ADS Group, British Aviation Group and Sustainable Aviation Coalition as founding partners, the event was supported by the likes of Exolum, RAeS, Zaffra, Otto Aviation, 1point5, ICF, Alaska Airlines, ATI, Embraer, Air League and Willis Lease.

The group said in a report that the current production of SAF makes up just 0.3% of global jet fuel use, totaling about 1.25 billion litres.

But to meet airline net-zero targets and comply with emerging government rules, the industry will need four times that amount, or more than 450 billion litres.

Several countries are already rolling out SAF polices that require airlines to use it in their jet-fuel mix.

China will require airlines to use a 2% SAF blend by 2025, rising to 15% by 2030. The EU will start with a 2% blend in 2025 and increase it to 70% by 2050.

Similar rules are in place in the UK, Sweden, France, Norway, Brazil and Japan, while discussions are underway in India, Turkey, and Australia.

Could SAF Drive up Travel Costs

WTTC warned that SAF prices could be up to 10 times higher than conventional jet fuel, due to high production costs, and a lack of infrastructure and feedstock. It said this could drive up air fares and discourage travel.

SAF is typically made from sources such as cooking oil, animal fats, plant oils, municipal waste, agricultural residues. and forestry waste.

“Sustainable fuel is the single biggest game changer for travel and tourism, but right now, supply falls dangerously short of demand,” said Julia Simpson, WTTC president and CEO. “Every hotel, tour operator, travel agency, cruise line and airline has a role to play.”

She added: “Sustainable fuel is not just an environmental necessity. It's a business imperative. Governments must incentivize SAF production, not just set targets.”

Many governments say they are investing in SAF. The European Union for example said it will publish its plan to overcome market challenges and a lack of investment later this year.

The aviation sector has repeatedly raised concerns about the lack of progress on SAF. But the fuel industry has rejected these claims.

Fuels Europe, which represents major oil and gas companies and fuel producers, said its members are on track to meet the mandates.

“We reject claims suggesting a lack of sustainable-aviation fuel,” a Fuels Europe spokesperson told Skift. ""SAF output has grown tenfold in just two years, prices are falling, and new capacity is coming online, despite unclear policies and investment hurdles,” the spokesperson said.

World Travel and Tourism Council and ICF unveil a powerful framework to scale Sustainable Aviation Fuel production and drive the tourism industry toward a sustainable future.

The travel and tourism sector is facing a critical challenge: dramatically reducing carbon emissions from transport. To meet this goal, the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) and global consultancy ICF have jointly launched an innovative framework aimed at accelerating the adoption and production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other renewable fuels throughout the tourism industry.

The newly published report, Scaling Up Sustainable Fuel, offers a clear and actionable strategy that empowers all tourism businesses—from airlines and cruise operators to hotels and travel agencies—to actively contribute toward cleaner fuel use and lower emissions.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel as the Key to Decarbonizing Travel

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is rapidly gaining recognition as the most impactful solution for cutting transport emissions in the travel sector. Despite this, current SAF production meets only a fraction of the growing demand. Without swift and coordinated efforts, the industry risks soaring fuel prices, limited fuel availability, and setbacks in climate goals.

Presently, SAF accounts for just 0.3% of the global aviation fuel supply. Achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 will require a monumental increase in SAF output—more than 400 times the current volume. This translates into scaling production from roughly 1.25 billion litres today to over 450 billion litres annually. Meeting this demand necessitates the construction of thousands of new renewable fuel production facilities worldwide. Similar supply and infrastructure challenges exist for Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF), which is critical for decarbonizing shipping and cruise operations.

SAF’s major advantage lies in its compatibility with existing aircraft and engines, making it a direct replacement for conventional jet fuel without requiring modifications. However, high production costs, limited refueling infrastructure, and competition for raw materials continue to restrict SAF’s market penetration, with prices sometimes ten times higher than traditional fuels.

Empowering Every Business to Take Meaningful Action

The WTTC and ICF framework outlines four distinct roles for tourism businesses—Collaborators, Promoters, Adopters, and Investors—encouraging participation at every level. Smaller businesses can contribute by supporting sustainability campaigns or providing waste feedstocks, while larger companies can invest in production facilities or commit to purchasing sustainable fuel credits.

The transition to sustainable fuels requires the entire tourism ecosystem to engage and implement changes, both operational and strategic. Airlines have been leaders in SAF adoption, but hotels, cruise lines, and travel agencies also play essential roles in supporting and accelerating this shift.

Examples of Industry Progress

Several organizations are already pioneering SAF initiatives. For example, in Asia, a hospitality group converts cooking oil waste from its hotels into SAF feedstock, creating a circular sustainability model. Meanwhile, a European airline has invested in a SAF plant that uses recyclable household waste, showcasing innovative ways to produce sustainable fuels while managing waste streams effectively.

Economic Imperatives and Risks of Inaction

The report cautions that without coordinated industry efforts, mandatory SAF blending targets set by governments—ranging from five to ten percent by 2030—could lead to increased travel costs and reduced consumer choice. This could dampen demand and hinder the sector’s growth potential.

With the travel and tourism industry projected to contribute $16.5 trillion to the global economy and support over 460 million jobs by 2035, expanding SAF production is not only critical for environmental reasons but is also vital to safeguarding economic prosperity worldwide.

A Strategic Blueprint for the Future

This collaboration provides a comprehensive blueprint that aligns governments, fuel producers, and tourism stakeholders toward a shared sustainability vision. It calls for enhanced government incentives, expanded infrastructure investments, and innovative partnerships that leverage the collective strengths of all players in the travel ecosystem.

Government action is crucial—beyond setting emissions targets, policies must support SAF production and reduce market barriers to enable widespread adoption.

Conclusion

The future of travel depends on a swift and united response to scale sustainable aviation and marine fuels. The WTTC and ICF’s strategic framework delivers a practical, inclusive roadmap that allows every segment of the tourism industry to contribute to a cleaner, more sustainable future.

Teams from the FAAM Airborne Laboratory, universities, research centres and aerospace companies are working together on a “chase” experiment, the first of its kind in the UK.

A pioneering project called GRIM-SAF (GRound-Based and Inflight Measurements) is investigating how sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could reduce aircraft emissions of soot and volatile particles, and a range of gases including nitrogen oxides, often referred to as the non-carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

Led by scientists from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, Cardiff University, the University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University, the University of York, and Rolls Royce, this research marks a major step forward in understanding how different aviation fuels change the impact of flying on air quality and the climate.

In a UK-first experiment, two aircraft flew in formation – with one trailing the other to sample its emissions – to compare the pollutants produced by sustainable aviation fuel and traditional jet fuel. Previous in-flight emissions work in the UK has involved following several miles behind other aircraft – the aircraft involved in GRIM-SAF were able to get within 60m of each other. Both aircraft also landed at RAF Brize Norton to make detailed ground-based measurements with the goal of linking this to the in-flight work.

A team of scientists led by Dr Paul I. Williams, from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and University of Manchester, conducted a series of experiments to learn more about the non-CO2 impacts of SAF on the environment.

The FAAM Airborne Laboratory’s atmospheric research aircraft “chased” Cranfield University’s National Flying Laboratory Centre research aircraft to measure the emissions it produces during flight.

“Although this type of experiment, with one aircraft following another in formation, is very useful for scientists to get an understanding of the emissions produced by burning different types of fuels, it is environmentally costly. GRIM-SAF aims to understand the emissions on the ground, and correlate these to emissions at altitude so future experiments don’t rely on chasing aircraft with other aircraft,” says lead researcher Dr Paul I Williams.

With sustainable aviation fuel use gaining momentum, find out how GRIM-SAF will be uncovering the fuel’s full environmental potential.

What’s emitted by aircraft and what are their impacts?

“We often talk about the environmental impact of air travel in terms of the carbon dioxide emissions produced, but this is just one part of the picture. Effective Radiative Forcing (ERF) is a measure of a particular pollutant or sector’s impact on climate. Non-CO2 emissions can contribute up to 66% of aviation’s ERF, compared with 33% from CO2. Additionally, it’s important to understand what effects they have on our local air quality around airports,” says Dr Paul I Williams.

Nitrogen oxides, known as NOx, are significant contributors to air pollution, impacting air quality and affecting our climate. The majority of NOx emissions presently come from cars and HGVs, but as electric cars become more widespread the aviation sector will become responsible for a larger share of this.

The non-CO2 emissions and other substances, such as lubrication oil vented from engines, can cause contrails to form. Contrails are long, thin clouds made of ice crystals, which form when water vapour condenses on the tiny particles emitted by aircraft engines. Contrails sometimes spread out over large areas, and can affect the Earth’s climate in the same way that naturally-formed clouds do.

Emissions from aircraft aren’t just limited to the skies; ultrafine particles have been detected many kilometres downwind of airports at ground level, especially major airports that see heavy air traffic. Increased particulate matter (PM) concentrations in the air is a sign of poor air quality, which can be harmful for people living in these locations.

What is SAF’s impact on cloud formation and local air quality?

In 2023, scientists from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science found that the FAAM Airborne Laboratory atmospheric research aircraft’s engine emitted less soot when it was running on SAF compared to traditional aviation fuels.

Previous research has found that climate models do not accurately calculate NOx levels at altitude, which makes it harder for scientists to make predictions about future climate change.

GRIM-SAF aims to give scientists a better understanding of gaseous and particulate emissions from aircraft. In addition to the chase experiments, a team based at RAF Brize Norton used a specialist sampling probe to monitor the non-CO2 emissions from these aircraft from the ground to correlate future ground-based measurements with in flight predictions.

The FAAM Airborne Laboratory’s aircraft will also sample its own exhaust emissions from SAF and traditional fuel in several flights by flying in a “doughnut” or “racetrack” pattern. Test flights in October 2024 confirmed that the FAAM aircraft can fly along and detect its own exhaust trails.

But the government has come under pressure from green groups and MPs concerned that airport expansion would make it harder for the U.K. to hit its climate goals.
Under that scenario, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — a lower-carbon jet fuel still in the initial stages of development — would make up 22 percent of fuels by 2050.
New legislation requiring airlines to ensure two percent of the jet fuel they use is sustainable, known as a SAF mandate, was laid before parliament this week.
“A third runway at Heathrow doesn’t make sense for the economy or the environment.","LONDON — Opening a third runway at Heathrow Airport could result in pollution equivalent to an additional 2.4 million tons of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere each year by 2050, according to government estimates seen by POLITICO.

The data, obtained through a Freedom of Information request, sets out for the first time Whitehall's forecasts for the additional environmental damage caused if a controversial third runway is opened at Heathrow in 2039.

The figure, from analysis conducted in January this year, is based on modeling applying ministers’ current “policy ambition” to cut aviation emissions.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced in January that the government would back a third runway at Heathrow, the U.K.’s biggest airport. Her support is part of the Treasury’s bid to boost sluggish economic growth and generate jobs.

But the government has come under pressure from green groups and MPs concerned that airport expansion would make it harder for the U.K. to hit its climate goals.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, who voted against Heathrow expansion in 2018, said it would take place only if legally-binding carbon budget targets can still be met, which in practice means emissions from the third runway would need to be offset by reducing pollution elsewhere in the economy.

Miliband's Department for Energy Security and Net Zero declined to answer how it would achieve these offsets, referring the query to the Department for Transport.

It is now up to Heathrow bosses to submit expansion plans by the summer. The airport is aiming to get a green light before the end of this parliament.

Jet zero

The data, released by the Department for Transport (DfT), is based on a scenario where a third runway at Heathrow becomes fully operational in 2039. Under that scenario, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — a lower-carbon jet fuel still in the initial stages of development — would make up 22 percent of fuels by 2050.

New legislation requiring airlines to ensure two percent of the jet fuel they use is sustainable, known as a SAF mandate, was laid before parliament this week. Ministers hope the industry could hit 22 percent as early as 2040, where the requirement will be fixed “until there is greater certainty regarding SAF supply.”

Separate government calculations released by the DfT, based on a “high ambition” scenario where SAF makes up 50 percent of jet fuel by 2050, found additional emissions from Heathrow would be equivalent to 1.4 million tons of CO2.

That scenario, modeled on a “jet zero” strategy published by the previous government, would also see the roll out of zero-emissions flights and greater fuel efficiency.

Some emissions created from a third runway could be offset by passengers opting to fly from Heathrow who could otherwise have flown from a different U.K. airport, according to an accompanying DfT document.

“A third runway at Heathrow doesn’t make sense for the economy or the environment. It would undermine regional growth and the U.K.’s domestic tourism industry,” said Nick Davies, head of climate policy at the Green Alliance think tank. “We’ve got a long way to go to zero-emissions flights — so the reality is that allowing airport expansion to go ahead will fly in the face of the U.K.’s climate targets.”

Experts warned that overall emissions could still be higher than the DfT estimate, since government modeling looked at expansion at other airports and excluded any additional emissions produced by inbound flights and in the construction of new infrastructure and other airport operations.

The government risks “tarnishing the U.K.'s climate credentials” for “minimal economic benefit,” said Alex Chapman, a senior economist at the New Economics Foundation think tank. “We estimate around two-thirds of new flights created are taken by a tiny minority of wealthy, U.K.-based, frequent flyers travelling for leisure.”

A DfT spokesperson said: “Expanding Heathrow could drive growth, trade and tourism and unlock over 100,000 jobs, cementing our position as a world leader in aviation. We are committed to reaching net zero by 2050 and any expansion plans would be assessed against the government’s legal, carbon and environmental obligations.”

Zhejiang Jiaao Enprotech announced on 7 May that its subsidiary biofuel plant completed the sale after obtaining an export license, but did not state where the shipment was bound for.

According to an earlier announcement by the company, it was included in a government “exporter whitelist” last month – the first private company to be added. This allows Zhejiang Jiaao to export all of its maximum annual output of about 370,000 tonnes of SAF this year.

Several other biofuel manufacturers have also applied for SAF export licenses and are expected to be approved soon, reported WeChat energy channel Global Zero Carbon.

China does not currently have a harmonised system (HS) code – an internationally standardised numerical identifier classifying traded products – for SAF. In its place, customs authorities allowed Zhejiang Jiaao use of the HS code for “jet fuel (excluding biodiesel)”, setting a precedent for future SAF exporters, the channel noted.

Exports of the fuel’s raw material, used cooking oil (UCO), have mostly been destined for the EU, which accounted for over 90% of Chinese UCO exports in 2023, noted Environmental Economics Magazine. The high EU demand will likely be reflected in SAF exports as well, given the bloc’s January rule that all departing flights must use fuel containing more than 2% SAF from 2025, the magazine added.

China’s domestic demand for SAF is also expected to grow, with several internal commercial flights having trialled use of the fuel in late 2024. That year, the country’s completed SAF projects reached an annual production capacity of 350,000 tonnes, and its announced planned production capacity exceeded 3.53 million tonnes, according to Caijing.

The Lightning Plan, through the Community Energy Act, will expand access to shared digesters to help more farmers and rural communities benefit.
Regional Clean Hydrogen Tax Credit: Up to $49 million annually for regional hydrogen projects, with lower thresholds to qualify.
The Lightning Plan will supercharge energy development in the Commonwealth, positioning Pennsylvania to lead the way in clean, reliable, and affordable energy for years to come.","Harrisburg, PA – This week, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed two key components of Governor Shapiro’s commonsense energy plan, known as the “Lightning Plan,” with bipartisan support. The legislation passed includes the Pennsylvania Economic Development for a Growing Economy (EDGE) Tax Credit, which was established in 2022, but hasn’t been used, leaving billions in potential economic development untapped. Additionally, the House also passed the Community Energy Act, which would improve the ability of agriculture producers and low-income Pennsylvanians to jointly share energy resources to lower their costs.

Supported by a broad coalition of labor and industry leaders, environmental advocates, and consumer groups, the Governor’s commonsense energy plan will create jobs, lower costs for consumers, speed up permitting, and protect Pennsylvania from global instability by building more energy generation in Pennsylvania – positioning the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come.

“Pennsylvania has long been a national energy leader, from Ben Franklin to today, and my energy plan will power Pennsylvania forward by incentivizing the building of next generation energy projects in the Commonwealth,” said Governor Shapiro. “We have to meet this moment and this plan – supported by leaders from the energy industry, organized labor and environmental groups, and consumer advocates – will lower costs for consumers, create more jobs, speed up permitting, and position the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come. The time for action is now and I look forward to working with leaders in the General Assembly to get this legislation to my desk.”

Governor Shapiro highlighted the benefits of community energy while visiting Penn England Farms in Blair County last month, where a methane digester is turning farm waste into clean energy, cutting electricity costs, and generating revenue. The Lightning Plan, through the Community Energy Act, will expand access to shared digesters to help more farmers and rural communities benefit.

The EDGE Tax Credit passed today is a collection of tax credit programs designed to attract new investments from businesses in critical manufacturing and energy sectors, including semiconductors, biomedical, milk processing, and and clean, reliable, affordable energy generation and storage. The Lightning Plan proposes several tax credit modifications to ensure businesses can actually take advantage of the credit to create jobs, innovate, and grow our economy, including:

Reliable Energy Investment Credit: Up to $100 million per facility, focused on adding clean, reliable, and affordable energy sources to the grid.

Regional Clean Hydrogen Tax Credit: Up to $49 million annually for regional hydrogen projects, with lower thresholds to qualify.

Semiconductor Manufacturing, Biomedical Manufacturing and Research Tax Credit: up to $8 million per year for semiconductor manufacturing and up to $2 million per year for early-stage semiconductor businesses.

Milk Processing Tax Credit Program: Invests in Pennsylvania’s agricultural industry by providing up to $15 million in tax credits per year and $120 million total for milk processing facilities.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Up to $15 million per year to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) through projects that make at least a $250 million investment.

Governor Shapiro’s energy plan will provide funding for new projects through the updated tax credits, streamline energy project approvals by creating a state energy siting board to cut red tape, and increase rebates for energy-efficient appliances to help reduce household energy costs. The Lightning Plan will supercharge energy development in the Commonwealth, positioning Pennsylvania to lead the way in clean, reliable, and affordable energy for years to come.

About WTTC The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) represents the global travel & tourism private sector.
Members include 200 CEOs, Chairs and Presidents of the world's leading travel & tourism companies from all geographies covering all industries.","London, UK - The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), in collaboration with global consultancy ICF, has today launched a bold new framework urging the entire Travel & Tourism sector to unite in tackling one of its toughest challenges: scaling up the production and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other renewable fuels.

The report, Scaling Up Sustainable Fuel, sets out a practical roadmap for how every business in the sector, no matter its size or role, can help address transport-related emissions and accelerate the shift to cleaner fuels.

Sustainable fuel is the single biggest game-changer for Travel & Tourism, but right now, supply falls dangerously short of demand. If we don’t act together, we risk rising costs, limited availability, and stalled climate progress.

Every hotel, tour operator, travel agency, cruise line and airline has a role to play. This framework gives them the blueprint. Sustainable fuel is not just an environmental necessity; it’s a business imperative and governments must incentivise the production of SAF, not just set targets for the sector. Julia Simpson, WTTC President & CEO

Today, SAF accounts for just 0.3% of global jet fuel use. To meet net-zero targets by 2050, production must increase more than 400-fold – from 1.25BN litres today to over 450BN litres. That will require as many as 6,500 new renewable fuel plants worldwide. Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF) faces similar supply and infrastructure constraints.

Unlike other decarbonisation options, SAF is a ‘drop-in’ solution. It works with existing engines and aircraft. But high production costs, limited infrastructure, and feedstock competition have kept volumes low and prices high – up to 10 times that of conventional fuel.

The new WTTC-ICF framework offers clear, tiered actions for Travel & Tourism stakeholders to engage, whether as Collaborators, Promoters, Adopters, or Investors. From joining campaigns and supplying waste products, to funding production facilities or purchasing sustainable fuel certificates, the report makes it clear: every business can contribute.

Decarbonising transport is a crucial step towards achieving a sustainable tourism sector. While transport industries, particularly aviation with its focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), have recognised the importance of sustainable fuels and are couragesouly working towards a new era, there remains a significant journey ahead. It is essential for the broader tourism ecosystem to take action and provide support to meet the targets set, as well as to implement both operational and strategic changes required.

ICF is proud to have collaborated closely with WTTC to identify the roles that tourism stakeholders can adopt and the actions they can take to facilitate the decarbonisation of the sector, thereby contributing to a more sustainable future. Daniel Galpin, ICF Managing Director

Real-world case studies show how action is already underway. The Erawan Group is turning hotel waste oil into SAF, in Asia, whilst Jet2 has invested in a UK-based SAF plant using recyclable household waste.

Crucially, the report warns that unless the sector acts collectively, SAF mandates introduced by governments, requiring a 5% to 10% blend by 2030, could increase travel costs and limit consumer choice.

With Travel & Tourism forecast to generate $16.5TN and support over 460MN jobs by 2035, scaling up sustainable fuel isn’t just an environmental challenge. It’s an economic imperative.

The first producers are already offering synthetic fuels based on biofuels or Fischer-Tropsch technology, but global capacities are still limited.
""With our patented METHAJET® technology, we are creating a sustainable alternative to fossil jet fuel.","The EwOPro project is a continuation of the successful KEROSyN100 project and will be funded until summer 2026. The focus is on the development of sustainable, synthetic fuels for the aviation industry (Sustainable Aviation Fuels, SAF), which are intended to replace fossil jet fuels proportionally and, in the long term, completely. The EwOPro project focuses on the olefins-to-jet fuel process as the centrepiece of the methanol-to-jet fuel route. ""The scaling-up step represents a milestone in closing the carbon cycle,"" says Martin Gräbner, Professor of Energy Process Engineering at IEC. ""The results of the pilot plant form the basis for industrial application and thus enable a significant contribution to climate neutrality in the near future."" And Prof. Sven Kureti, Chair of Reaction Engineering, adds: ""I am delighted that our catalyst research can continue to develop towards technical application with the pilot plant that has been set up.""

Competitive market and vision for the future

The airlines within the International Air Transport Association (IATA) have set themselves the goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. There is no alternative to liquid aviation fuels, as they have to provide a high energy density for long-haul flights in order to cover such distances. The first producers are already offering synthetic fuels based on biofuels or Fischer-Tropsch technology, but global capacities are still limited. eSAF technologies capitalizing the methanol route are highly efficient thanks to a high product yield with low energy requirements.

""With our patented METHAJET® technology, we are creating a sustainable alternative to fossil jet fuel. At the same time, we strengthen the value creation in Germany and Europe,"" explains Jörg Engelmann, Managing Director of CAC ENGINEERING. ""In contrast to conventional processes such as Fischer-Tropsch, methanol can be produced at energy-favoured locations and transported efficiently as a liquid energy source. The final processing can take place both at these favourable locations and at European locations with the appropriate infrastructure."" The Chemnitz-based engineering service provider coordinates the project and licenses the technology. For large-scale plant construction CAC has already successfully brought the innovative technology for the production of synthetic, climate-neutral gasoline (CAC METHAFUEL®) to market maturity and is currently planning Germany's first commercial gasoline synthesis plant.

Strong partnerships for innovative technologies

In addition to TU Bergakademie Freiberg, the funded project partners include DBI Gas- und Umwelttechnik GmbH and the Fraunhofer Institute for Ceramic Technologies and Systems (Fraunhofer IKTS). Associated partners from industry and politics are contributing to the practical application and market launch.

Next steps

The first jet fuel samples for the certification process are to be submitted to the international standardisation organisation ASTM in 2026. A very successful pre-screening took already place in 2024 as part of the KEROSyN100 research project.

SÃO PAULO—It came as no surprise that China committed earlier this week to increase its economic and geopolitical engagement with Latin America and the Caribbean. But what does stand out is that Xi Jinping appears to be aligning more closely than ever with the region as the Trump administration pushes an agenda focused on migration, tariffs, and even expansionist ambitions.

The contrast between the two approaches toward Latin America and the Caribbean was evident as Beijing hosted the fourth ministerial meeting of the China-CELAC Forum. The presence of leaders such as Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (Brazil), Gustavo Petro (Colombia), and Gabriel Boric (Chile) signaled a renewed willingness for regional coordination in dialogue with Beijing.

At the same time, China reaffirmed its role as an engaged power in the Global South, underscoring the dilemmas Latin American nations have faced amid heightened U.S.-China competition. Even Haiti and Saint Lucia, two of Taiwan’s dwindling number of diplomatic allies in the region, participated.

By announcing a $9 billion yuan-denominated credit line and fresh infrastructure investment for the region, Xi not only reasserted China’s role as a development financier but also positioned the yuan as an alternative to the dollar-dominated monetary logic—a strategy aligned with the country’s long-term efforts to internationalize its currency. “There are no winners in tariff wars or trade wars. Bullying or hegemonism only leads to self-isolation,” Xi said in his inaugural speech.

Sino-Latin American commercial complementarity is well established: China imports a vast amount of commodities and exports an ever-increasing amount of manufactured goods. However, recent agreements reveal growing sophistication in areas of cooperation. Chinese investments in electric mobility, renewable energy, artificial intelligence, and green infrastructure signal a new phase in this partnership, one that transcends primary export dependency and extends into high-tech value chains.

Deepening Brazil-China ties

For Brazil, the $5 billion planned investment announced during Lula’s visit to Beijing represents a strategic diversification, encompassing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, electric vehicle plants, and solar and wind energy projects in the northeast. The commitment, under the umbrella of 36 commercial agreements, combines economic diplomacy and the green transition with the potential to generate jobs, innovation, and medium-term geopolitical gains.

These investments also reveal China’s ability to align commercial interests with a systemic vision of global integration, bringing together the state, private companies, and banks in a coherent international expansion strategy. In this context, Brazil gains the opportunity to reposition itself as a hub of stability and sustainability, reinforcing its role as a key interlocutor in a shifting global order.

For President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the new chapter in the relationship with China presented an opportunity to raise his voice against a tariff-centered U.S. policy and reaffirm his commitment to help negotiate peace in Ukraine. “Trade wars have no winners,” Lula said in a speech. “They raise prices, depress economies, and erode incomes of the most vulnerable in all countries. President Xi Jinping and I advocate for fair trade based on the rules of the World Trade Organization.” Addressing the war, he stated that the “‘common understandings between Brazil and China on political settlement of the Ukraine crisis’ offer a foundation for a comprehensive dialogue that allows peace to return to Europe.”

Horizontal cooperation

China aims to expand its presence in Latin America, just as the U.S. adopts a protectionist and anti-multilateral stance under Trump’s leadership. Washington’s strategic neglect of its neighborhood contrasts with Beijing’s intensive engagement, patient diplomacy, and attractive financing. The void left by the U.S., especially in infrastructure funding and support for regional integration, has been skillfully filled by Chinese diplomacy, which offers resources and a message of respect for sovereignty and non-intervention.

Although China brings concrete opportunities to Latin American countries, deepening these ties also imposes challenges. The first is symbolic and political: To what extent does growing dependence on Chinese investments compromise the region’s autonomy in decision-making? The second is structural: How can Latin American countries ensure that ties with China last without replacing one dependency with another? The third challenge is internal: Are our political systems—still marked by instability and weak institutional resilience—prepared to negotiate on equal footing with a power like China? Furthermore, there is the risk that the appeal of easy, short-term solutions may undermine efforts to build an autonomous and sustainable regional agenda.

By defending the strengthening of CELAC and affirming that “the uncompromising defense of multilateralism is an urgent and necessary task,” Lula sought to demonstrate that it is possible to engage with multiple power centers without relinquishing authority. However, this equation requires constant vigilance, effective regional coordination, and the capacity to formulate long-term national strategies—conditions that have not always been present in recent history. It also calls for rethinking the role of regional multilateral organizations, such as MERCOSUR, as platforms that can lend coherence to Latin America’s voice in global forums.

The Beijing summit leaves valuable lessons. First, multipolarity is already a reality, and Latin America must position itself intelligently on this evolving chessboard. The second is that presence matters: Those willing to listen, invest, and commit—as China is doing today—gain space. The third is that international leadership is not delegated; instead, it is built through vision, consistency, and a willingness to take on responsibility.

In this redrawn world, Latin America’s place may depend less on ideological affinities and more on its ability to convert opportunity into influence. There is a narrow—but possible—path toward more autonomous leadership.

Under the RCM’s Guaranteed Strike Price model, producers will receive a fixed price for SAF. If the market price is lower, the Government will pay the difference. If it is higher, producers will return the extra profit.

To pay for the scheme, the Government will introduce a variable levy on aviation fuel suppliers. The cost of this levy is expected to be passed on indirectly to passengers, but the impact on fares has been capped.

The DfT has confirmed this week that the average annual increase to a single air fare across the sector will not exceed £1.50.

The mechanism aims to make investment in SAF more attractive by reducing financial risk. SAF is significantly more expensive to produce and currently makes up a small fraction of total jet fuel use. However, policymakers and businesses are betting heavily on increasing SAF uptake to reduce aircraft emissions.

Aviation Minister Mike Kane said: “Aviation continues to be one of the fastest growing and most integral parts of the UK’s economy, offering more jobs across engineering, tourism and hospitality – and as we support aviation expansion, we need to move at full throttle towards decarbonisation.

“We are making the UK one of the best places in the world to produce SAF, putting the pedal down on growth and boosting job opportunities across the country as part of the Plan for Change.”

SAF Mandate

The RCM supports the UK’s SAF Mandate, which requires that 10% of jet fuel used in UK-departing flights be made from sustainable sources by 2030, rising to 22% by 2040. SAF can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by around 70% on a lifecycle basis, according to government estimates.

The Government is aiming cut GHG emissions from aviation by up to 6.3 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2040, with SAF expected to contribute significantly to this target. By 2030, the UK is expected to use 1.2 million tonnes of SAF annually.

Alongside the RCM, the Government also announced £400,000 in new funding to support fuel testing and certification in aviation. This follows £63m already committed through the Advanced Fuels Fund earlier this year.

The DfT said it will continue to consult with industry stakeholders on how the RCM will operate in practice, including how the strike price is set.",https://edienetlive.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/HeathrowLanding2025.gif,N,,2025-05-15 10:56:40.274943

Well, our recent study found that even with optimistic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and fuel efficiency assumptions, the net-zero carbon target could be exceeded as early as 2037.
Therefore, to meet the 2050 net-zero target, accelerating efforts to develop ZEPs seems critical.
It will also feature an updated version of the ICCT’s net-zero aviation roadmap, which for the first time will include the climate impact of non-CO2 emissions.
The recent setbacks are a wake-up call and these indicators will tell us if ZEPs can move from prototypes to actionable climate solutions.","Just a few years ago, proposals for zero-emission planes (ZEPs) were regularly attracting headlines for their potential to dramatically reduce global carbon emissions from aviation. But now things are rather different, as the past several months have been filled with setbacks. Let’s consider what this means for efforts by policymakers and the aviation industry to achieve aviation’s target of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050.

The most high-profile setback came when Airbus pushed back its ambitious goal to introduce hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft in 2035. Citing a mix of infrastructure challenges and slower-than-expected technology development, it made the announcement during the Airbus Summit 2025 and expects a 5-10-year delay. Airbus isn’t alone. Other manufacturers have recently dialed back plans or hit financial difficulties. Why this turbulence? Well, as with Airbus, the primary challenges are technology and infrastructure.

Technologically, battery-electric aircraft remain limited to serving short routes (less than 500 km) due to severe battery weight limitations. Jet fuel is still roughly 50 times more energy dense than today’s most advanced lithium battery. While jet fuel contains about 43 MJ/kg of energy, the most advanced lithium-ion batteries today offer only around 0.9–1.0 MJ/kg, making them roughly 40 to 50 times less energy dense by weight. The additional battery weight increases the total mass the aircraft must lift and thus the energy to sustain flight—creating a compounding penalty. Hydrogen technologies such as fuel cells and combustion engines can offer greater range but face their own set of engineering hurdles, particularly concerning the need to develop lighter hydrogen storage tanks and more powerful fuel cells to minimize their significant mass and volume penalty. One of the major aircraft manufacturers, Embraer, recently pushed back its Energia project, a family of low-emission hybrid-electric aircraft, because both battery and hydrogen fuel cell advancements have been slower than hoped. This necessitated the delay of the project from its original intended entry-into-service year of 2035.

Infrastructure is probably an even bigger barrier. Airbus noted that inadequate hydrogen infrastructure—including hydrogen production, distribution, and fueling facilities, airport expansion and modification, and new safety protocols—is one of the major roadblocks to its ZEROe program, the flagship hydrogen-powered aircraft initiative aimed at launching the world’s first commercial ZEP. Indeed, green hydrogen, which is produced using renewable electricity and water electrolysis, comprised less than 1% of global hydrogen production in 2024. And even if green hydrogen were being produced in large volumes, the infrastructure to reliably distribute hydrogen remains sparse and expensive to build. Regulatory frameworks are also lagging, and that’s creating uncertainty and slowing investment. For example, Airbus recently reduced the budget for ZEROe by 25%.

What about the innovative startups we heard about a few years ago? Universal Hydrogen, a U.S.-based company that aimed to decarbonize regional aviation by retrofitting planes to run on hydrogen fuel cells, achieved a remarkable goal when it flew the largest aircraft ever on hydrogen-electric power. However, Universal shut down a year later after failing to secure enough funding to continue research and development. Eviation, an electric-plane startup based in Washington state, paused its Alice program and laid off most of its employees. That these firms struggled to secure the substantial funding and regulatory support necessary to scale is a lesson for the aviation industry: Zero-emission flight requires sustained and coordinated investment and collaboration beyond the reach of individual companies.

What does this all mean for aviation’s climate targets? Well, our recent study found that even with optimistic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and fuel efficiency assumptions, the net-zero carbon target could be exceeded as early as 2037. Therefore, to meet the 2050 net-zero target, accelerating efforts to develop ZEPs seems critical. But with Airbus and others suggesting that 2035 is infeasible, achieving the net-zero target by 2050 looks more difficult than ever.

This puts more pressure on SAF, technical efficiency improvements, and operational optimization to fill the gap. Due in part to this reality, hybrid-electric solutions have emerged as intermediate alternatives because they can be integrated in the medium term and offer moderate emission reductions (even though they are short of climate goals, including when combined with SAFs).

The upcoming update to our Vision 2050 report will reflect the latest industry realities and reassess the role that ZEPs, SAFs, and other mitigation measures must play to realistically meet global targets. It will also feature an updated version of the ICCT’s net-zero aviation roadmap, which for the first time will include the climate impact of non-CO2 emissions.

Ultimately, stakeholders have to ask: Are hydrogen tanks getting lighter? Are fuel cells getting more powerful? Is battery chemistry improving? The recent setbacks are a wake-up call and these indicators will tell us if ZEPs can move from prototypes to actionable climate solutions. Even if there is continued progress on the technology side, the business case will need to be addressed—both the capital and regulatory aspects—to make ZEPs into a reality. In the meantime, as important as ZEPs are to the long-term solution, to stay on track for 2050 it’s likely that policymakers and the aviation industry will have to focus on alternative measures that can deliver medium-term emission savings.",https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AdobeStock_431775423_scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 06:56:08.015878

Although the UK has halved its carbon emissions since 1990, explained independent advisor the Climate Change Committee (CCC), much work remains to be done.
Notably, with around 50% of UK carbon emissions reductions in 2008 attributable to evolving energy supplies, the recommended 7th carbon budget for 2040 (CB7) will require a shift in focus.
Additionally, while airlines can’t begin “engaging with every passenger on the planet,” it’s important to build long-term trust, he suggested.
Stay tuned for Aerospace Global News’ second day of coverage from day two of of the event.","As Sustainable Skies World Summit (SSWS) opened its doors to the industry on day one of the annual event, “climate change is not a choice,” reiterated Jonathan Counsell, group director of sustainability, IAG Group. And buoyed yet again with the underlying imperative that it takes an entire industry’s input to address aviation’s ongoing sustainability challenges, attendees from across the sector – from airlines to fuel producers, innovators and regulators – arrived at Farnborough International for two days of insight and discussion.

Welcoming over 110 speakers across the event, complemented by 36 showcase exhibitors, the elevated number of attendees at the summit was certainly indicative of the scale of the challenge. Now in its fourth iteration, SSWS attendance has risen exponentially from a few hundred attendees in 2022 to some 1,300 plus, explained Counsell, who stressed: “Climate change is not a PR opportunity. And it’s not if we address it, it’s how”.

Certainly, the scope of the global challenge at hand – the decarbonisation of a sector universally acknowledged as ‘hard to abate’ – was not shied away from. Although the UK has halved its carbon emissions since 1990, explained independent advisor the Climate Change Committee (CCC), much work remains to be done. Notably, with around 50% of UK carbon emissions reductions in 2008 attributable to evolving energy supplies, the recommended 7th carbon budget for 2040 (CB7) will require a shift in focus. And despite agricultural and land use set to comprise some 35% alone of this reduction alone, aviation invariably has its part to play, too. By 2040, the CCC’s roadmap projects that SAF will be responsible for some 33% of emissions savings; helping to address what could otherwise become an “existential industry for the industry” – with aviation and agriculture nevertheless set to become the two biggest greenhouse gas emitting sectors by 2040.

As such, the time to start addressing these challenges is now. From pioneering propulsion systems and alternative fuels (such as SAF, electrification and hydrogen) to carbon sequestration, offset strategies, efficiency advancements and clean-sheet aircraft deigns, a thoughtful day of panel discussions and workshops faced the industry’s challenges head-on. Although many ‘pathway to net zero’ roadmaps have been drawn up, “the only thing we can say with any certainty is that all roadmaps are wrong,” mused Anna Stukas, VP of strategic partnerships at carbon capture and storage company 1PointFive. However, with the “building blocks” already in place to effect meaningful change and “leverage strengths”, she urged that “taking small steps is OK” (even if each of these so-called ‘baby steps’ represent significant technological progression and millions, if not billions, of dollars at a time).

And there is ample cause for optimism along the way. Net zero analysis from the UK Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) estimates SAF will play a 25%-30% part in reducing emissions by 2050, with many calling for further government support to solidify revenue certainty mechanisms and bolster production. As Jill Blickstein, chief sustainability officer at American Airlines, succinctly explained: “SAF doesn’t have to be a partisan issue – it’s a growth issue”.

Indeed, over the past 20 years, crude oil has fluctuated from between $0.50 to $4 a gallon, revealed Jan Toshka, CEO of sustainable aviation fuel venture Zaffra highlighted. Amid fears that SAF surcharges may price many people out of flying (with fuel currently accountable for around 25% of the overall ticket price), the industry has still grown, he highlighted. Additionally, while airlines can’t begin “engaging with every passenger on the planet,” it’s important to build long-term trust, he suggested.

While SAF remains the largest widely-accepted lever to accelerate aviation’s short-term decarbonisation efforts, hydrogen’s potential also remains a key factor, with airports such as London Heathrow and Amsterdam Schiphol also highlighting their perspectives on the future of infrastructure decisions. These are “really significant choices and investment decisions,” suggested London Heathrow’s carbon strategy director Matt Gorman, citing sustainability concerns as at the heart of any future expansion plans.

From airports to the types of aircraft themselves- with Germany’s all-electric Vaeridion and the US Otto Aviation’s laminar-flow business jet representing two vastly different aircraft concepts discussed during the day – it seems there is no single solution or lack of innovation on hand. Even airspace modernisation – acknowledged by NATS sustainability, and health and safety director Ian Jopson as a relatively small financial outlay offering huge benefits – has its part to play. Although a moderately small contribution, “we know how do to it,” he suggested, proving that even comparatively small investments could account for up to 5% of the total carbon savings (according to UK Aerospace Technology Institute analysis).

Although methods and strategies – seen by many as complementary rather than contradictory – may differ, this overall determination to innovate is “really part of our history,” concluded Cesar Perira, chief sustainability officer at Embraer.

WTTC Urges the Travel & Tourism Industry to Collaborate on Scaling Sustainable Aviation Fuel for a Net-Zero FutureIn a landmark move, the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), in partnership with global consultancy ICF, has released a comprehensive new framework urging the global Travel & Tourism sector to unite in tackling one of its most pressing challenges: scaling up the production and adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other renewable fuels.

This call to action comes at a critical time when the sector is striving to meet ambitious net-zero targets and address its significant carbon footprint.

The Challenge: Scaling Sustainable Aviation Fuel Supply to Match Demand

Julia Simpson, WTTC President and CEO, highlighted the urgency of addressing the supply-demand imbalance for SAF:

“Sustainable fuel is the single biggest game-changer for Travel & Tourism, but right now, supply falls dangerously short of demand. If we don’t act together, we risk rising costs, limited availability, and stalled climate progress.”

Today, SAF accounts for a mere 0.3% of global jet fuel consumption. To align with net-zero emissions goals by 2050, production needs to increase more than 400-fold — from approximately 1.25 billion litres to over 450 billion litres annually. Achieving this scale will require establishing around 6,500 new renewable fuel plants globally. Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF), which similarly addresses maritime transport emissions, faces analogous production and infrastructure barriers.

Why SAF is a Crucial, Practical Solution

Unlike some decarbonisation options that require new aircraft or engine technologies, SAF is a ‘drop-in’ fuel, meaning it can be used directly in existing engines and infrastructure without modification. This characteristic makes it an attractive and immediate solution for reducing aviation emissions.

However, the challenges of high production costs, limited feedstock availability, and underdeveloped infrastructure have kept SAF production volumes low and prices significantly higher than conventional jet fuel — sometimes up to ten times more expensive. Overcoming these hurdles is essential for broad adoption.

WTTC-ICF Framework: A Blueprint for Sector-Wide Engagement

The new report, Scaling Up Sustainable Fuel, provides a practical roadmap tailored to different types of businesses within the Travel & Tourism ecosystem, including hotels, tour operators, travel agencies, cruise lines, and airlines. It defines clear roles businesses can assume to support SAF growth, categorized as:

Collaborators: Entities that join campaigns, promote sustainable fuels, and share best practices.

Promoters: Those who actively educate stakeholders and customers on sustainable fuel benefits.

Adopters: Companies purchasing SAF or sustainable fuel certificates to reduce their carbon footprint.

Investors: Businesses funding production facilities or infrastructure development to increase SAF availability.

This tiered approach ensures that every organization, regardless of size or resources, can contribute meaningfully to scaling sustainable fuel use.

Insights from Industry Leaders and Case Studies

Daniel Galpin, Managing Director of ICF, emphasized the crucial role of the wider tourism ecosystem in supporting decarbonisation:

“Decarbonising transport is a crucial step towards achieving a sustainable tourism sector. While transport industries, particularly aviation with its focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), have recognised the importance of sustainable fuels and are courageously working towards a new era, there remains a significant journey ahead.”

Real-world examples underscore progress already underway:

The Erawan Group in Asia is innovatively converting hotel waste oil into SAF, turning waste into a valuable, renewable resource.

Jet2 has invested in a UK-based SAF plant that utilizes recyclable household waste, exemplifying circular economy principles.

These cases demonstrate how different stakeholders across Travel & Tourism can harness innovative solutions to support sustainable fuel production.

Economic and Environmental Imperatives for Scaling SAF

Travel & Tourism is forecasted to generate $16.5 trillion and support over 460 million jobs globally by 2035. The sector’s growth is vital to economies worldwide, but it must proceed sustainably to protect the environment.

Government bodies, such as the UK’s Department for Transport (DfT) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), emphasize the importance of transitioning to renewable fuels to meet climate commitments under the Paris Agreement and national net-zero targets.

The European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, part of the EU’s broader “Fit for 55” climate package, mandates increasing SAF use on flights operating in the bloc, illustrating government efforts to regulate and stimulate sustainable fuel uptake (European Commission Aviation).

The Risk of Inaction: Rising Costs and Consumer Impact

The WTTC-ICF report warns that without collective sector action, governments may impose SAF mandates requiring airlines to blend 5% to 10% SAF into jet fuel by 2030.

Without sufficient supply and cooperative engagement from the Travel & Tourism industry, these mandates could lead to increased travel costs and reduced consumer choice, potentially dampening demand and stalling tourism recovery post-pandemic.

Therefore, proactive investment and participation from all tourism businesses are essential to scale supply, reduce costs, and ensure an equitable transition.

Broader Role of Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF)

In addition to aviation, sustainable marine fuels are critical for decarbonizing the cruise and shipping sectors. Like SAF, SMF adoption faces challenges related to feedstock competition, production costs, and infrastructure development. The WTTC encourages the maritime sector within Travel & Tourism to also align with sustainable fuel scaling efforts to achieve holistic industry decarbonisation.

Government and Industry Collaboration: A Key to Success

Governments play a pivotal role in incentivizing SAF production through policy instruments such as tax credits, subsidies, and research funding.

The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive set examples of ambitious policies designed to accelerate sustainable fuel market growth.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) advocates for public-private partnerships to bridge investment gaps and create viable supply chains.

Conclusion: A Collective Call to Action

Sustainable fuel represents both an environmental necessity and a business imperative for the Travel & Tourism sector.

WTTC’s new framework highlights that from hotels and tour operators to airlines and cruise lines, every business has a critical role in scaling production and adoption of SAF and SMF.

The path to net-zero emissions requires collaboration, innovation, and strategic investment.

The UK Government has implemented new measures today (14 May 2025) to help the UK become a world leader in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), supporting industry growth and boosting jobs nationwide.

Sustainable aviation fuel is an alternative to fossil jet fuel, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 70% on average on a lifecycle basis. Sustainable fuel is more costly than jet fuel; however, the new measures will protect the industry and consumers from excessive costs.

£400,000 funding to speed up clean fuel production

Decarbonisation is an essential factor in accelerating expansion plans, and to get sustainable aviation fuel to the market quicker, the government has allocated an additional £400,000 in funding to help producers get the fuel on the market quicker. This funding will support testing and qualification of green fuels and follows £63m funding made available through the Advanced Fuels Fund this year.

Additionally, the revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) will keep ticket price changes minimal, keeping fluctuations to £1.50 a year on average. It will be industry-funded through a levy for aviation fuel suppliers. The Department for Transport (DfT) will continue to engage with the industry on the details of the RCM, including pricing.

This new commitment to sustainable aviation fuel will help fulfill the government’s mission to deliver economic growth through job creation, making it a clean energy superpower. It will allow the UK to go further and faster with expansion plans, boosting the tourism industry.

Aviation Minister Mike Kane said: “I want to see a golden age for green aviation, and today, we see take-offs for sustainable flights.

Aviation continues to be one of the fastest growing and most integral parts of the UK’s economy, offering more jobs across engineering, tourism and hospitality, and as we support aviation expansion, we need to move at full throttle towards decarbonisation.

We are making the UK one of the best places in the world to produce sustainable aviation fuel, putting the pedal down on growth and boosting job opportunities across the country as part of the Plan for Change.”

10% of all jet fuels must be made sustainably

The new measures will help the industry meet its requirements under the SAF Mandate, introduced in January this year, requiring at least 10% of all jet fuel used in UK flights from 2030 with sustainable fuel, rising to 22% by 2040.

The funding confirms the UK’s commitment to building a homegrown, sustainable fuel production hub. Low-carbon fuels could add up to £5bn to the economy by 2050 and position the UK as a global hub for sustainable aviation fuel production.

Tim Alderslade, Chief Executive of Airlines UK, said: “This is a welcome announcement given the importance of the RCM to commercialising and scaling up SAF production in the UK, a technology key to decarbonising aviation by 2050. A UK SAF industry, kick-started by the RCM and SAF Mandate, can create tens of thousands of jobs across the country whilst supporting our world-class aviation sector to deliver economic growth.

We look forward to working with government on scheme design and how contracts are allocated, so that we balance the need to deliver the SAF required to support mandate compliance, whilst keeping costs as low as possible through a competitive and transparent bidding process that places the consumer at its heart.”

Duncan McCourt, Chief Executive of Sustainable Aviation, said: “We hugely welcome the publication of this important legislation. SAF is a crucial element in the plan to decarbonise aviation as it can be used in existing aircraft with existing infrastructure.

The challenge now is to scale the industry, ensuring we have enough SAF to meet the mandate whilst keeping costs low and create thousands of jobs in the process. This legislation will help to do that.”",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iStock-1278067350-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-15 05:56:12.727687

Building on trials in recent years, this season, 37 biofueled trucks will deliver freight for the events, a renewable and centralised energy system will power the pit and paddock areas, and the F2 and F3 championships will continue to race on 100% advanced sustainable fuel ahead of Formula 1 moving to sustainably fuelled cars in 2026.

READ MORE: 5 crucial milestone moments in F1 safety technology

The 2025 Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix will be the first of the nine European races to use a low carbon energy system across the paddock area, delivering an approximate 90% reduction in associated carbon emissions.

Supplied by Formula 1 partner Aggreko, the rollout to all European events follows successful trials at the 2023 Austrian Grand Prix, and the 2024 Austrian, Hungarian, and Italian Grands Prix, all of which yielded significant carbon reductions in the Paddock, Pit Lane, and Event Technical Centre.

The paddock-wide solution will centralise energy supply into one compound powered by renewable sources, such as hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), solar panels, and battery energy storage systems (BESS), and remove the requirement for Formula 1, the 10 F1 teams, and the FIA to use their own generators.

In addition to the carbon reduction through centralised, renewable energy generation, the reduction in on-site generators will also minimise associated transportation emissions.

The return of DHL’s biofuel fleet trucks across the European stint provides Formula 1 with another way to operate more sustainably through the use of alternative fuels.

In 2023, the use of biofuel-powered trucks during the European leg of the season resulted in an average reduction of logistics-related emissions by 83% compared to traditional fuels. This year, DHL will once again use 37 of its trucks to transport freight across Europe.

At the beginning of the season, F2 and F3 cars successfully made the move to Aramco’s 100% advanced sustainable fuel, following the use of 55% sustainable fuel last season. This move comes ahead of the Formula 1 cars adopting the fuels in 2026 in the new hybrid engines that will take to the circuit next year.

The move to 100% advanced sustainable fuels is an instrumental part of the sport’s alternative fuel strategy, as well as having a wider impact in the automotive industry, as the fuel developed by Formula 1 will be a ‘drop-in’ and can be used in road cars without modification, serving as a sustainable alternative of global benefit.

Formula 1’s alternative fuel strategy is a pivotal part of how the sport continues to reduce carbon emissions today. Last year, Formula 1 made significant investments in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), delivering an estimated 80% reduction in associated carbon emissions per flight compared to the use of conventional aviation fuel.

The combined investment in SAF with Global Partners DHL and Qatar Airways reduced total related emissions by more than 8,000 tCO2e (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent), an approximate 19% reduction in related emissions compared to traditional aviation fuel across the flyaway events of the 2024 season.

Did you know that leftover cooking oil can help power an A380 engine? Let me explain. Sustainable aviation fuel, or safe for short, is an alternative to traditional jet fuel. But how is it made? SAF, unlike traditional jet fuel, isn't derived from fossil sources. It's made from feedstock like agricultural waste, sugar cane byproducts, and even algae to produce SAP. Feed stocks are refined through chemical processing, then tested and certified to make sure that the end product meets all the performance, safety, and certification requirements of traditional jet fuel. The SAF is then blended with traditional jet fuel and drop straight. Some existing fueling infrastructure. Aviation is a hard to abate sector, which means there aren't many readily available solutions to help us reach our emissions targets. SAF is currently the single biggest lever we have to reduce aviation emissions. And today, alongside Sydney Airport, AMPOL and supported by our S Coalition made-up of leading Australian and international organisations, we're marking the largest ever commercial importation of SAF into Australia, with nearly 2,000,000 litres arriving this week. We've already begun taking steps to help us.

Drawing from the science of leadership and the timeless lessons of musical legends, here are seven powerful ways leaders can transform their teams into high-performing ensembles.
Leadership takeaway: In today’s hyper-distracted workplaces, attention has become the new competitive advantage.
Like great musicians, great leaders don’t scatter their energy; they channel it.
Leadership takeaway: Excellence doesn’t happen by accident; it’s engineered.","In business, as in music, true mastery isn’t about striving for mechanical perfection but resonance, rhythm and trust.

Before I became a business strategist and certified neuroleadership coach, I was a professional bassist, trained in classical and jazz performance. What I learned on the concert stage about collaboration, adaptation and peak performance now informs everything I teach leaders about orchestrating high-performing teams.

Today, neuroscience confirms what great musicians have always known: peak team performance is a synchronized act of emotional connection, cognitive agility and intentional practice. Research published in Harvard Business Review shows that teams with strong emotional bonds and psychological safety outperform others by as much as 27% on complex tasks. Similarly, a study in Frontiers in Psychology found that musical ensembles’ ability to synchronize with each other relies on shared mental models — a principle equally vital for organizational success.

Drawing from the science of leadership and the timeless lessons of musical legends, here are seven powerful ways leaders can transform their teams into high-performing ensembles.

1. Practice like Prince: Focus is a superpower

Prince was more than a talented performer — he was a perfectionist of craft. He mastered dozens of instruments, choreographed his shows and oversaw production. His obsessive focus wasn’t accidental; it was a practiced discipline.

Leadership takeaway: In today’s hyper-distracted workplaces, attention has become the new competitive advantage. According to Harvard Business Review, multitasking can reduce productivity by as much as 40%. Leaders who try to juggle everything dilute their impact.

What to do:

Create a daily “focus setlist” identifying your top three critical priorities.

Schedule uninterrupted blocks (at least 90 minutes) for strategic thinking.

Protect these blocks like sound checks before a concert — non-negotiable.

Like great musicians, great leaders don’t scatter their energy; they channel it.

2. Lead like Beyoncé: Excellence is in the details

Beyoncé’s legendary performances are the result of rigorous preparation. Every lighting cue, costume change and note is meticulously rehearsed. Yet what’s extraordinary is how her teams — backup dancers, musicians and crew reflect that same standard of excellence.

Leadership takeaway: Excellence doesn’t happen by accident; it’s engineered. A 2022 Gallup study showed that teams with clear goals and expectations outperform others by 20% in productivity and profitability.

What to do:

Set crystal-clear expectations for every project — objectives, roles and outcomes.

Prepare for critical meetings like Beyoncé preps for tour rehearsals: anticipate questions, align stakeholders and create backup plans.

Role-play difficult conversations with a coach or trusted colleague to fine-tune delivery.

Small details, rehearsed consistently, make the difference between a good performance and a standing ovation.

3. Improvise like Coltrane: Make space for innovation

John Coltrane’s improvisations weren’t chaotic — they were intentional explorations built atop the deep musical structure. Improvisation at its best is a profound act of listening, adapting and creating in real-time.

Leadership takeaway: In fast-paced industries, innovation doesn’t come from rigid planning—it comes from adaptive collaboration. Google’s Project Aristotle identified psychological safety and open idea-sharing as the top predictors of team success.

What to do:

Schedule “improv jams” once a month — open sessions where teams brainstorm ideas without judgment.

Rotate facilitators to avoid hierarchy dominating the room.

Celebrate wild ideas; iteration often comes after exploration.

When leaders create structured spaces for spontaneity, they unleash hidden creativity within their teams.

4. Collaborate like The Beatles: Harmony beats hierarchy

The Beatles weren’t just a collection of solo stars but a system of mutual amplification. Paul’s basslines supported John’s lyrics. Ringo’s drums filled George’s guitar riffs. Their magic came from synergy, not ego.

Leadership takeaway: Diversity of strengths fuels innovation — but only when collaboration is nurtured. McKinsey’s research shows that diverse teams are 35% more likely to outperform their peers in profitability, but only when there is intentional collaboration.

What to do:

Break down departmental silos with regular cross-functional “sectionals” short, problem-solving huddles across departments.

Assign team goals that can only be achieved through cross-unit collaboration.

Recognize and reward collaboration as much as individual achievement.

Harmony beats hierarchy every time — and the music you create together will be richer for it.

5. Reinvent like David Bowie: Stay relevant by evolving

David Bowie wasn’t afraid to evolve artistically or personally. He shifted personas, genres and styles while remaining undeniably himself. Reinvention wasn’t about abandoning identity but growing into new possibilities.

Leadership takeaway: Today’s world demands reinvention. The World Economic Forum predicts that 50% of all employees will need reskilling by 2025 to meet changing job requirements.

What to do:

Host quarterly “Retire, Refresh, Reimagine” workshops with your team.

Ask: What practices are outdated? What strengths should we amplify? What innovations should we chase?

Encourage career pathing and lateral moves that build skills outside narrow job roles.

Leaders who embrace reinvention model adaptability — and their teams follow suit.

6. Play the long game like Billie Eilish: Vulnerability builds trust

Billie Eilish broke into global fame by doing the unthinkable: leading with vulnerability. She ditched pop’s traditional polish for raw honesty — and millions resonated.

Leadership takeaway: Vulnerability isn’t weakness; it’s a catalyst for trust. According to research in Harvard Business Review, leaders who model vulnerability increase team learning behaviors and engagement by up to 30%.

What to do:

In team retrospectives, openly share lessons from mistakes or missteps.

Invite feedback about your leadership style — and act on it visibly.

Celebrate vulnerability in others: highlight when a team member shares a hard truth or admits a mistake.

When leaders are brave enough to be human, their teams become brave enough to innovate.

7. Think like an orchestra: Culture is the bass, strategy is the drums

The rhythm section — the bass and drums — sets the tone in any great band or orchestra. If the rhythm falters, no amount of brilliant solos can save the performance.

Leadership takeaway: Strategy (the plan) and culture (the human connection) must cohere. According to the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), toxic workplace cultures cost US businesses over $223 billion in turnover over five years.

What to do:

Conduct quarterly “culture check-ins” with your team.

Regularly assess whether strategy and culture are aligned, and course correct if not.

Remember: If the culture feels offbeat, even the best strategy will eventually collapse.

When strategy keeps tempo and culture provides groove, your team will not just deliver projects — they’ll deliver performances.

Build your leadership symphony

High-performing teams don’t happen by accident. They are composed, rehearsed and fine-tuned over time. As a leader, you’re not simply managing projects but orchestrating energy, emotion and execution.

Your team occasionally hits the wrong notes, like a great band or symphony. But if you keep the rhythm strong, foster trust, encourage creativity and lead authentically, you’ll create performances — and business outcomes — that stand the test of time.

So ask yourself: What music are you making with your team? And is it something worth listening to, growing with and celebrating every day?

The agreement was reached during a BRICS Transport Working Group meeting held in Brasilia, as Brazil holds the rotating presidency of the bloc.

The declaration includes commitments to decarbonization, sustainable fuels and modal integration, while rejecting unilateral restrictions that could hinder access to essential technologies.

A key proposal is the creation of a BRICS Institute for Sustainable Transport, Mobility, and Logistics to promote best practices and climate-resilient infrastructure planning.

""This marks the first ministerial declaration focused solely on transport,"" said acting Ports and Airports Minister of Brazil Mariana Pescatori. ""It allows us to align strategic interests and promote sustainable solutions.""

Ministers at the meeting also pledged to expand cooperation on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), aiming to meet climate targets under the International Civil Aviation Organization. Brazil has already set national targets for SAF use, starting with 1 percent in 2027 and rising to 10 percent by 2037.

The bloc compiled a compendium of national initiatives to decarbonize ports and maritime transport, including electrification and infrastructure adaptation.

Other commitments include enhancing air connectivity among BRICS countries and exploring a new multilateral aviation mechanism.

Azure Sustainable Fuels Corp. is working in partnership with Tk’emlúps te Secwepemc to make the project a reality.

The facility would convert agricultural feedstocks, mainly canola, into Sustainable Aviation Fuel using a process called the Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids process.

The technology has been in commercial use and in operations for several years in many facilities around the world, including facilities in North America, Azure said in a written statement sent to iNFOnews.ca. The company is exploring multiple sites including Manitoba, Ontario and Kansas but they don't have any facilities in operation.

Already used by several airlines, the sustainable aviation fuel is approved for blending up to 50% with conventional jet fuel. In contrast to fossil fuels, the renewable fuel results in fewer carbon dioxide emissions.

In December 2024, a company called Parklands became the first in Canada to produce low carbon aviation fuel at its Burnaby Refinery, producing more than 100,000 litres that was purchased by Air Canada, according to Parkland's website.

The Azure plant is one part of the 7Mile District development project by Tk’emlúps te Secwepemc, that aims to turn a section of the reservation into an industrial park on one side and a solar powered agricultural area on the other.

The land sits between Highway 5 and the North Thompson River, and is divided in half by the CN rail yard.

The jet fuel plant would be built on a 71-hectare heavy industrial section and include storage tanks for feedstocks and products, process units for fuel production and utilities to support process units. According to the 7Mile District Master Plan, Azure is proposing to minimize the use of fossil fuels as an energy source for process operations, and use the train to transport feedstock.

The facility would produce roughly 20,000 barrels per day of renewable fuel, or up to 1 billion litres per year, providing for the reduction of up to 2,600,000 tonnes of CO2 annually, the master plan said. If the heavy industrial use plan proves to be unfeasible, either another industrial anchor might be chosen or a more locally focused, multi-business industrial park model built instead.

British Columbia has set a renewable fuel target for jet fuel at 1% starting in 2028 and increasing to 3% in 2030. Several countries around the world, including the United Kingdom and the European Union have set targets for minimum amount of sustainable aviation fuel requirements ranging from 2% in 2025 up to 70% in 2050, according to Azure.

The 7Mile Renewable Fuels Facility is currently undergoing community engagement, and regulatory and environmental review, and a final investment decision is expected in 2026.

Panelists at an American Medical Association webinar explored the challenges rural IPs face and the resources that can help them keep patients and health care workers safe.

Challenges around infection prevention training

A focus group led by Drs. Ylinne Lynch and Liza Rosenman of the Teaching Infection Prevention through Simulation team at the University of Washington found that many infection preventionists “fell” into the role due to administrative reasons and have a broad range of backgrounds, which can be a benefit. But they didn’t have the tools they needed to be successful. Some reported having to learn on the job, often with little institutional support, leaving them feeling overwhelmed.

Moreover, they reported difficulties getting infection prevention education to appropriate teams, due to misinformation, staff turnover or competing demands. Regardless, they have empathy for clinicians, understanding they face competing priorities, with one participant noting that clinicians are “just trying to get through caring for someone with a higher ratio than normal, and you’re trying to talk about hand hygiene.”

A separate assessment by infection preventionists and registered nurses Lauren Musil and Alisha Sheffield of the University of Nebraska Medical Center found similar challenges. More than 60% of infection preventionists said that they had infection prevention and control training, but only 44% felt it was adequate. On top of that, many have multiple roles, making it difficult to effectively do their job. However, infection preventionists report more job satisfaction if they have the support of hospital leadership, Musil said.

Lynch also touched on that. “I think what’s really hard about [infection prevention and control] is that when it’s done really well, the value’s a little bit invisible,” she said. “You can’t really easily measure the HAIs that are prevented.”

Resources for infection preventionists

The TIPS focus groups found that infection preventionists want more resources to support their efforts. Some participants noted that they needed to create culturally relevant materials or otherwise needed additional guidance to bolster and improve their infection prevention programs.

The IPC Support Center, described by Musil, aims to support such programs by providing tools for IPC education and practice. The center’s Self-led Infection Control Evaluation, or SLICE, tool allows rural and critical access acute care facilities to perform a self-evaluation of their infection prevention programs to identify areas for opportunity. Domains involve environmental cleaning, injection safety and critical device reprocessing, among others, providing resources and immediate summary reports. The center’s “Behind the Mask” webinar series corresponds to the SLICE tool, providing a way to ”reach hundreds of IPs instead of just one IP at a time to answer” pressing questions, Sheffield added.

Other resources within the IPC Support Center include the Extended Reality Education Program, created specifically for sterile processing workflows, giving users the opportunity to become familiar with them before stepping into a processing space. IPs can take advantage of the training by using a headset for an immersive experience, or through a laptop or tablet. The center also has a growing resource repository that includes checklists, audit forms and templates.

Local support

Another resource for IPs is their local Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology chapter, where they can connect with other professionals who have similar questions, Sheffield said. Local and state public health departments, as well as health care coalitions, also are resources that IPs can tap in to, and Musil noted that some departments offer office hours specifically for IPs, as well as webinars and infection prevention courses.

Sheffield had more advice for IPs in rural areas: Cold call IP professionals at other facilities to network and collaborate. She added that she has found success by putting herself out there and connecting with others in the field.

Results from the TIPS focus group support the idea of formal and informal networking. Participating IPs said they have shadowed IPs at other facilities and networked to learn how other professionals do their jobs and what worked for them, while others leaned on conferences, webinars and APIC resources.

“There’s lots of support within this community. Everybody’s rooting for one another,” Sheffield said.",https://www.smartbrief.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/infection-prevention-e1747245188960.png,N,,2025-05-14 21:56:12.754276

It is estimated that roughly 40% of the world's potential SAF feedstock will come from Asia-Pacific, particularly Southeast Asia.
Southeast Asia could produce 26 million tonnes of SAF per year, of which 5 million tonnes would come from Thailand, she said.
Energy conglomerates Bangchak and PTT Global Chemical have already begun SAF production.
SAF comprises less than 1% of global aviation fuel used today, but it should reach 6% by 2030, she said.","Airbus is banking on Southeast Asia becoming the world's top producer of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), while the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT) plans to mandate 1% SAF usage for European routes starting in the fourth quarter.

Julie Kitcher, chief sustainability officer at Airbus, said with SAF key to achieving its net-zero goal by 2050, she is optimistic about Thailand's prospects of becoming a global SAF producer and supplier.

SAF, also known as biofuel for aircraft, is a liquid fuel made of feedstock that can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% across the lifecycle, from production to usage.

It is estimated that roughly 40% of the world's potential SAF feedstock will come from Asia-Pacific, particularly Southeast Asia.

Southeast Asia could produce 26 million tonnes of SAF per year, of which 5 million tonnes would come from Thailand, she said.

Ms Kitcher said Thailand already has a strong agricultural sector with extensive feedstocks such as molasses, rice straw and rice husks.

Energy conglomerates Bangchak and PTT Global Chemical have already begun SAF production.

The decreased demand for bioethanol in Thai road transport due to the uptick in electric vehicles could free up space in production plants to produce more SAF, she said.

Ms Kitcher said Thailand's challenge is developing an in-depth feasibility study for different types of feedstocks, its location, accessibility as well as collection and transport costs.

In Thailand, the aviation sector contributed more than 7% of GDP before the pandemic, as more than 80% of inbound tourists arrived by air.

SAF comprises less than 1% of global aviation fuel used today, but it should reach 6% by 2030, she said.

The fuel costs 3-5 times more than kerosene, as it requires more investment in new projects to help reduce prices.

Ms Kitcher said policymakers should create schemes to help assure revenue for producers, which could help sustain the growth of SAF production, allowing them to confidently plan production 5-7 years ahead.

Airbus jets can be powered by up to 50% SAF blending and the company is also developing new aircraft to adopt a 100% SAF blend by 2030, she said.

ACM Manat Chavanaprayoon, director-general of the CAAT, said the authority is now in the final stage of gathering feedback in order to announce a regulation mandating SAF usage by Thai carriers, which should minimise the impact for airlines and passengers, and be ready by the end of this year.

Mr Manat said it plans to start with mandating a 1% SAF blend, as SAF today costs over three times more than jet A-1 fuel.

The 1% usage should not significantly affect airfares and would allow the CAAT to study its impact during the initial phase, he said.

This measure might be introduced on European routes first since the EU already mandated using a 2% blend of SAF at their airports and penalising airlines who fail to meet SAF blending requirements.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2025/05/14/5605196_700.jpg,N,,2025-05-14 19:56:47.253492

“The American Biogas Council applauds the House Ways and Means Committee for extending the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit in its reconciliation bill,” said Patrick Serfass, executive director of the ABC.","The House Ways and Means Committee on May 14 advanced its portion of President Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax bill. The draft legislation amends and extends the 45Z clean fuel production credit but repeals several other clean energy tax credits.

The existing 45Z tax credit, established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, provides a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transformation fuels. The credit starts at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit is up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. The tax credit is currently in place for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

Section 111112 of the draft legislation aims to limit availability of the 45Z credit to fuels produced from feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S. It also aims to exclude indirect land use change (ILUC) from being used to calculate the lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of eligible fuel and directs the U.S. Treasury Department to establish distinct emissions rates for specific manure feedstocks.

The draft bill would extend the 45Z credit through Dec. 31, 2031. Additional changes to the 45Z credit aim to eliminate transferability of the credit for fuel produced after Dec. 31, 2027, and restrict access to the credit for certain prohibited foreign entities.

The draft bill leaves the 45Q credit for carbon sequestration largely intact but aims to enact restrictions on transferability. Specifically, the legislation would repeal transferability for carbon capture equipment where construction begins two years after the bill’s date of enactment. It also restricts access to the credit for certain prohibited foreign entities.

While the draft bill updates and extends the 45Z tax credit and leaves the 45Q credit mostly unchanged, it also aims to repeal and scale back numerous other clean energy tax credits, including the clean hydrogen tax credit and the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit.

The alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit allows taxpayers to claim a tax credit for advanced refueling property placed in service during a give tax year, including property used to dispense E85, biodiesel blends of B20 or greater, natural gas, hydrogen, propane, and electricity. The credit value is 30% of the cost of the property, up to $100,000. The credit is currently scheduled to retire on Dec. 31, 2032. The draft bill would accelerate the sunset date of the credit to Dec. 31, 2025.

The bill also aims to terminate the clean hydrogen production tax credit, which was established by the IRA and allows taxpayers to claim a credit per kilogram of qualified clean hydrogen produced for sale or use. The credit is based on GHG emission ate of the production process, with a value of up to 60 cents per kilogram. The clean hydrogen tax credit is currently available for facilities that commence construction before Jan. 1, 2033. The draft bill would accelerate the expiration of the credit to facilities the construction of which begins after Dec. 32, 2025.

Another section of the draft bill aims to phase-out a credit that supports the installation of residential wood heating appliances. The legislation would terminate the energy efficient home improvement credit, which currently allows taxpayers to claim a tax credit for household energy efficiency improvements. The value of the credit is 30% of qualified expenses, up to $1,200 annually, or $2,000 for heat pumps and biomass stoves. The credit is currently set to expire on Dec. 31, 2032. The draft bill would accelerate the expiration to Dec. 31, 2025.

In addition, the draft bill seeks to phase out the production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) for clean electricity. The credits are not currently set to expire. The draft bill, however, aims to phase out the credit by reducing the value of the credit by 20% for facilities placed into service after 2029, by 40% for facilities placed into service in 2030, and 60% for facilities placed into service 2031. No credit would be available for facilities placed into service after 2031. Bill provisions also eliminate transferability of the credit and restrict access to the credit for certain prohibited foreign entities.

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAC) Coalition has spoken out in support of the bill’s 45Z provisions. “Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a key solution for strengthening U.S. energy dominance, driving investment in rural economies and positioning the United States as a global leader in SAF production,” said Alison Graab, executive director of the SAF Coalition.

“The SAF Coalition is grateful to the Ways & Means Committee for supporting the extension of the Clean Fuel Production Credit (45Z) through 2031,” Graab continued. “This critical legislation provides long-term certainty for SAF producers, incentivizes private sector investment, and builds out a robust domestic supply chain. The bill ensures that 45Z delivers direct benefits to U.S. farmers and rural economies.

“We urge Congress to pass this extension to reinforce our energy dominance and unleash the full economic potential of America’s heartland.”

The American Biogas Council is also applauding extension of the 45Z credit. “The American Biogas Council applauds the House Ways and Means Committee for extending the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit in its reconciliation bill,” said Patrick Serfass, executive director of the ABC. “This is a critical step toward supporting reliable renewable fuels like biogas that reduce air and water pollution, create American-made energy, and drive rural economic development. The extension of 45Z ensures continued momentum for investment in biogas systems that turn organic waste into clean energy—benefiting communities, farmers, and rural economies.”
