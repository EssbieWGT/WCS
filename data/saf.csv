However, researchers believe it could be transformed into a key ingredient for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). A new report from researchers at the University of Michigan explores pathways to recycle the existing carbon source into a climate solution for the aviation industry.

CO2 from ethanol fermentation is uniquely valuable. The fermentation process yields pure streams containing 85% CO2 by volume or higher, unlike gas streams from industrial processes. This makes it easier and less energy-intensive to capture. Because the CO2 was originally separated from the air by corn plants, capturing and reusing it for fuel creates a carbon-recycling loop that does not add new CO2 to the atmosphere.

Defossilizing Aviation Fuel

Aviation produces over a gigaton of fossil CO2 emissions annually. Researchers believe it is essential to find scalable, non-carbon stocks. The U.S. ethanol industry’s 2023 output of 15.6 billion gallons released 48 megatons of CO2. This presents a huge, ready-to-scale resource.

U-M research scientist Stephen McCord said, “It is exciting to explore whether this ‘waste’ stream can actually become a significant asset, turning inefficiency into advantage and accelerating the real-world application of emerging technologies.”

U-M researchers compared an existing corn-based SAF production method called Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) with two new CO2-based routes. According to researchers, the AtJ process is effective but achieves a carbon reduction of only 4.5% to 20% compared to conventional jet fuel.

The two CO2-based pathways, however, start by converting captured CO2 into syngas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen). One path, Gas Fermentation, creates ethanol using syngas before using the AtJ process. The second path, Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis, feeds syngas directly into a reactor to synthesize long-chain liquid jet fuel hydrocarbons.

A lifecycle assessment of the two methods projected substantial environmental benefits for both CO2 routes. However, the Gas Fermentation route was deemed the path with the “smoothest transition.”",https://www.tomorrowsworldtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design-50.png,N,,2025-11-13 17:56:29.400188

Great Falls is also home to Montana Renewables, the largest producer of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in North America.
“Great Falls, Montana, makes operations affordable,” Schalper says.
Walleye, northern pike, sunfish, crappies, bass, catfish can all be found in the river waters running through Great Falls.
Every year, the week of March 19 (Russell’s birthday) is marked by Western Art Week in Great Falls.","There is no shortage of drive and entrepreneurial spirit in Big Sky Country.

From the moment my flight touched down at Great Falls International Airport in early October, signs of the area’s economic, geographic and cultural identity began to appear.

One of the first things I spied from the airplane window was a U.S. Air Force plane, later identified as a Lockheed C-130 Hercules. The Montana Air National Guard and Malmstrom Air Force Base are both located in Great Falls. The Air Guard’s mission includes tactical airlift, firefighting and search and rescue operations. The U.S. Air Force will be modernizing its aging nuclear missile system at Malmstrom Air Force Base (on the other side of the Missouri River from the airport). The Malmstrom AFB Sentinel Missile Upgrade program will see an estimated $1.5–2 billion in direct spending in Montana for construction, infrastructure, housing and support facilities. Malmstrom AFB manages over 150 missile silos across north-central Montana. The project is expected to spur more than 3,000 construction jobs and over 500 long-term support and maintenance positions.

Leaving the airport to catch my cab to the city, a gust of wind almost immediately snatched away the Atlanta Zoo baseball cap I was wearing to shield my eyes and airport hair. This proved to be an excellent aerometric marker for the abundant wind energy resources in the region, harvested via wind turbines that pepper the Great Falls landscape.

Welcome to the Electric City

And what a landscape it is: The Little Belt Mountains, Square Butte and the Rockies color the surrounding horizon of Great Falls, which at 60,000 residents is the third most populated city in the state after Billings and Missoula. Running through the city’s center is the Missouri River, which I walked alongside the next day with Jake Clark, vice president of business development at Great Falls Development Alliance. He told me about the moves being made to build out the local energy infrastructure.

“Great Falls has a really long history with energy,” Clark said, noting the several hydroelectric dams in the city that once powered copper production in the city. The Anaconda Copper Mining Company was the copper smelting and refining complex, in operation for about 100 years until its closure in 1980, that put Great Falls on the map. A power-intensive project that exemplified one of the first commercial uses of hydroelectric power, the refinery also smelted copper that would eventually be used in the early days of electrification across the country.

And the region continues to see big wins in energy and fuel.

“Our refinery cracked the code on sustainable aviation fuel,” says Clark about the Calumet Montana Refining facility. Great Falls is also home to Montana Renewables, the largest producer of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in North America. “And there’s a couple-billion-dollar upgrade ongoing right now to stay on the top of that hill,” Clark says of the $1.67 billion expansion at Montana Renewables supported by a U.S. Department of Energy loan guarantee, the largest clean energy investment in Montana. “So, they’ll be doing significantly more.”

Green hydrogen is also on the table for the Calumet refinery and at Montana Renewables. Most green fuels produced at the facilities are shipped to California, where state tax credits help incentivize that portion of the energy supply chain. “It’s farm-to-table jet fuel,” Clark says about the whole operation. “In addition to what is going on at our refinery now, Berkshire Hathaway Energy recently purchased what’s called the Montana Alberta Tie Line. If you go north of Great Falls, you see large wind farms. Those wind farms feed that line, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy purchased that in order to develop more energy business on the U.S. side of that line … We see the potential for a data center cluster between here and the Canadian border in our region to do several other data centers because we have more independent power generation than any other part of the state as well as the potential to develop some behind-the-meter additional assets. And we have enough acreage for supersites.”

A 600-MW hyperscale data center coming to the Great Falls area from Atlanta-based TAC Data Centers will span 569 acres and include 2 million sq. ft. under roof. The data center, dubbed Project Cardinal, is planned for an area near the AgriTech Park, north of Malstrom Air Force Base and near the Great Falls Rainbow Power Substation, with construction of the whole campus expected to be completed by 2030. Power capacity will be between 500 and 600 MW across several buildings, supported by two on-site substations. TAC is reported to be investing between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in the facility, which is projected to create 1,500 to 2,000 construction jobs and 150 to 200 high-paying permanent positions.

“We have the fiber,” Clark says about Great Falls’ potential for advanced digital infrastructure. “We have the water. We have the land. And we’re working on talent.”

Berkshire Hathaway Energy Montana will add a 72-MW battery system near Cut Bank (less than two hours from Great Falls), a 100-MW solar farm on about 1,000 acres in north-central Montana (expected to be complete in 2026) and a new Great Falls control center to complement the existing wind farms attached to the Montana Alberta Tie Line (MATL) connecting southern Alberta to Great Falls.

Always Improving

Since 2020, the city of Great Falls has experienced more economic activity, major investments and population growth than it’s seen in 40 years. Stability and affordability make the city a prime location for business, says Jolene Schalper, executive vice president at Great Falls Development Alliance.

“Great Falls, Montana, makes operations affordable,” Schalper says. “We have a long history of low taxes and stable governance. We seek out tools to aid our industries and are able to work in tandem with elected officials for meaningful policy change. Our job is to listen to you and identify ways to help you thrive. Your bottom line is ours. Your team are our neighbors. The focus on long-term relationships is a key component of why Great Falls, Montana, is a great place to do business.”

In addition to the business-friendly climate that the city and state have to offer, quality of life is always improving. On the city’s east side, the mixed-use development “The Falls,” expected to launch construction in late 2026, will be a 100-acre, $500 million to $700 million project featuring retail, hotel, homes, restaurants, trails and public spaces with the goal of becoming a shopping and living hub over the next two decades. Led by Mitchell Development & Investments, the project will measure 630,000 sq. ft. and host two hotels, 831 residential units and 20 acres of public space.

The area’s quality of life can also be measured by a long list of recreation, cultural and hospitality assets, including River’s Edge Trail, an urban trail system where I took an e-bike tour. The trail features nearly 60 miles of pathways (21 of them paved) and strings together several parks, sculptures and gazebos, connecting to the Lewis & Clark Interpretive Center, the Great Falls Civic Center, Riverside Railyard Skate Park, West Bank Park and Giant Springs State Park.

The Missouri River also supplies an abundance of fish for anglers. Walleye, northern pike, sunfish, crappies, bass, catfish can all be found in the river waters running through Great Falls. Blue ribbon trout fishing off the Missouri is also seen south of the city, and salmon has been known to also populate the river. This veritable haul lends itself to a strong local fishing economy which in 2024 contributed $910 million to Montana’s GDP, according to an August 2025 report by the Bureau of Business and Economic Research.

In downtown Great Falls, restaurant and bar Enbär, live music venue The Newberry, arcade bar Sidequest and ice cream shop Big Dipper form a thread of lively options all owned and operated by a local group of investors and entrepreneurs (Enbar Inc.) who also own the minor league baseball team, the Great Falls Voyagers.

A local family of entrepreneurs, the Tronsons, operate the successful 5th & Wine wine bar and restaurant, headed by patriarch Mark Tronson, as well as Buffalo Blanc, a local café & coffee bar run by daughter Whitney Tronson. Soon, the Tronson family will also add a sister wine & beer bar, Buffalo Noir, to their portfolio in Great Falls, which will be run by another Tronson daughter, Tara.

Other stops in the city that will delight include independent bookstore Cassiopeia Books (owned and operated by retired Brooklyn attorney Millie Whalen), Central Avenue Meats owned by head butcher Drew Hicks that sources beef and pork locally from McCafferty Ranch and Faltree Farms, respectively, and The Farmer’s Daughter Fibers, a nationally known yarn and fabric shop run by Candice English.

Visitors seeking an experience that reaches back to an earlier time will love the Sip ‘n Dip Lounge, in operation since 1962. The tiki bar, located in the historic O’Haire Inn downtown, features “mermaids” who swim up and greet patrons in an aquarium-like window view (sadly closed during my visit), kooky and vibrant tropical-themed art, a 64-ounce cocktail (the “fishbowl”) and a jazzy live musical performer.

Healthy Environment for Growth

The local hospital system in Great Falls, Benefis Health Systems, will be expanding its facilities with several new and upgraded services to better serve the health care needs of the community. Construction is currently underway on a Healthy Aging Center, a 15,000-sq.-ft. outpatient clinic expected to open in 2026 that will provide audiology, mobility and geriatric services. The Sanavita Estates Senior Living development will span nearly 43 acres with a 64-unit apartment building and 28 villas for 55+ individuals and provide quality-of-life amenities such as a wine bar, ice cream parlor and a wellness center. Benefis Health Systems also recently saw an expansion of its endoscopy lab, adding rooms and bays and cutting wait times, and a renovation of its Sletten Cancer Institute that will improve patient comfort with additional infusion chairs, private treatment rooms and larger lab and pharmacy space. A new walk-in urgent care clinic with on-site pharmacy, lab, imaging and occupational health services is also expected to open in late 2025.

In 2023, a new extension campus of Touro University, a Harlem-based private medical school system in New York City, opened in Great Falls — the Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine (TouroCOM). The 100,000-sq.-ft. medical school campus houses classrooms, an anatomy lab, a simulation center and more. Three students who will be part of the first group of medical school graduates to complete their education at TouroCOM told me the biggest draws of the school were its focus on providing care for those who need it most and its welcoming environment.

“I chose Touro because I wanted to explore a new state and environment that is different, coming from big cities,” says Shantell Angarita, who hopes to complete her residency in emergency medicine. “I was drawn toward the philosophy that Touro supports in serving patients in underserved areas.”

For Jireh Gerry, Touro was a perfect match for her goals of becoming an OB-GYN and also serving those same underserved populations.

“I chose Touro because the environment was so friendly and so refreshing from what I was used to in Los Angeles,” she says. “Additionally, the program at Touro truly helps equip student doctors to be able to serve underserved communities, which is my goal when I become a physician.”

Touro is a Jewish university system with several locations globally. Notably, the campus in Great Falls demonstrates respect for religions and walks of life from all over, providing kosher and halal cafeteria options and ways to learn and practice medicine for learners who come from different cultural backgrounds, such as providing simulation and computer-aided training for students who are not allowed to dissect cadavers due to spiritual beliefs.

The program at TouroCOM in Great Falls is expected to graduate 135 physicians each year.

Cowboys & Artists

Great Falls has a storied history of great art, dating back to the late 1800s and famed American artist of the American West Charles Marion Russell, who was one of the highest paid artists in the U.S. by the 1920s (largely helped by the business management acumen of his wife, Nancy Cooper Russell). Raised in Missouri, Russell moved to Montana at age 16 to work on ranches and lived there the rest of his life, eventually becoming a self-taught, full-time and prolific creator of Western works.

Every year, the week of March 19 (Russell’s birthday) is marked by Western Art Week in Great Falls. Millions of dollars in fine art are exhibited and sold at this event held at different locations in Great Falls, culminating in the Russell Auction — the hallmark fine art fundraising event held at the C.M. Russell Museum.",https://siteselection.com/media/Favicon-100x100.png,N,,2025-11-13 14:57:05.610509

LanzaJet has achieved a global first, confirming that its Freedom Pines Fuels plant in Soperton, Georgia, is now fully operational and producing on-spec jet fuel from ethanol at a commercial scale.

This marks the first time that alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) fuel has been manufactured in a commercial-scale facility anywhere in the world, and the first time a non-oil-based sustainable aviation fuel pathway beyond HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids) has reached this level of maturity.

The plant integrates several first-of-a-kind technologies, including LanzaJet’s proprietary ethanol-to-jet process, Technip Energies’ Hummingbird ethanol to ethylene unit, and an oligomerisation system developed jointly by the US Department of Energy and LanzaTech. LanzaJet brings these systems together into a continuous, end-to-end operation that produces fully certified jet fuel ready for blending.

The project represents over $300 million of investment and employment of more than 300 workers during construction. Around 65 direct and indirect roles remain in ongoing operations.

Company Chief Executive Jimmy Samartzis called the milestone “a major win for global aviation” and a demonstration of what is possible when research, engineering, and commercial deployment align. LanzaJet says the facility now serves as the template for future ATJ projects around the world.

How ethanol-to-jet unlocks new feedstocks beyond HEFA for SAF

This development addresses one of the central challenges facing the aviation sector. Almost all current SAF production is based on HEFA, and multiple expert bodies have warned that HEFA feedstocks are approaching their limit. Used cooking oil, animal fats, and related bio-oils cannot meet long-term demand, even with aggressive expansion.

ATJ directly broadens the supply base. Ethanol is produced at an industrial scale in multiple regions, and can also be derived from waste biomass, agricultural residues, municipal solid waste, and captured carbon. This allows countries with established ethanol industries to build domestic SAF capacity rather than rely on imports, reducing exposure to the feedstock constraints that have shaped the SAF market to date.

Freedom Pines demonstrates that a non-HEFA SAF pathway can operate reliably at a commercial scale, providing a reference design for other nations and investors. For airlines, it confirms that one of the most discussed next-generation SAF technologies can now deliver real volumes.

The timing is critical. With SAF mandates tightening in the EU, UK, and US, regulators have been clear that new pathways must reach commercial readiness before 2030 if long-term targets are to be met. Until now, few technologies had crossed that threshold.

What LanzaJet’s breakthrough means for future SAF production

LanzaJet intends to license and deploy its ATJ technology globally. The company is already working with partners in the US, UK, Japan, Australia, India, the EU, the Middle East, and South America. Freedom Pines is expected to serve as the model for future facilities, giving investors and governments a proven baseline for performance and integration.

The next phase will focus on replication at larger scales, cost reduction as plants mature, and securing long-term ethanol supply agreements, especially from waste and residue sources. The aviation sector will be watching closely to see whether ATJ plants can be brought online more quickly and reliably than other next-generation SAF projects, including Power to Liquid.

If successful, ATJ could become the first major post-HEFA pathway to deliver meaningful volumes of SAF before the end of the decade, easing supply pressure and helping airlines meet rising blend requirements. In a market defined by uncertainty, LanzaJet has now provided one of the clearest signs that the next wave of SAF production is finally beginning to materialise.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Lanzajet-ethanol-to-jet-fuel-SAF-plant-at-Freedom-Pines.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 11:56:53.678677

This isn't really new. People have been working on this for over a decade now and unfortunately it has been a rocky road. In the US, interest as of late has all but evaporated due to uncertainty in the regulatory regime. The failure of the Fulcrum Bioenergy SAF project in Nevada didn't help boost enthusiasm for investing in these types of projects either. Fortunately, there are still opportunities abroad.

Trying to convince yourself that any kind of ""sustainable"" aviation is possible is delusional.

CHICAGO and SOPERTON, Ga., Nov. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- LanzaJet, Inc., a leading next-gen fuels technology company and fuels producer, today announced that it has fully operated and produced fuels at its LanzaJet Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Soperton, Georgia, USA – marking both the world's first production of jet fuel using ethanol as a feedstock at a commercial-scale plant, and the first non-oil-based renewable solution compatible with today's aircraft.

This achievement marks the culmination of 15 years of research and development, collaboration, investment, and scale-up, and represents a critical breakthrough for the aviation industry with evidence that ethanol can be transformed into jet fuel at commercial scale. With the bio-oil HEFA pathway expected to near a plateau in available and qualified feedstocks, LanzaJet's proprietary Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology has now unlocked the next wave of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) technology applicable to nearly all regions throughout the world and urgently needed by the sector.

""Today proves what happens when you bring together innovation, resilience, ingenuity, and teamwork to think big and develop a new industry, overcome challenges, and enable global growth,"" said Jimmy Samartzis, Chief Executive Officer of LanzaJet. ""This is an important milestone for LanzaJet and our investors, and it's a major win for global aviation – perhaps serving as a beacon of hope for the future. Our story at LanzaJet is one of impact – building a new industry, creating value, and delivering on our commitments regardless of obstacles in our way. We're now in a unique position with technology and operational know-how to shape this global industry in the decade ahead.""

One of the most promising technologies in nearly a decade to reach commercial readiness, LanzaJet's ATJ technology offers a scalable solution to decarbonize aviation, leveraging the world's widely available ethanol feedstocks and the substantial additional production of ethanol possible from waste sources and recycled carbon. It provides the opportunity for countries to reinforce and expand their agriculture sectors by accessing this new market, enables economic development, and enhances domestic energy security. Nations can now leverage and control supply chains and domestic production of their fuels with LanzaJet's breakthrough technology.

LanzaJet Freedom Pines Fuels serves as a blueprint for future SAF production, creating a new pathway for global deployment and commercialization of the company's ATJ technology. LanzaJet successfully troubleshot and brought into operation a fully integrated First-of-a-Kind (FOAK) plant and technology solution. Included in LanzaJet's plant are also FOAK technologies - Technip Energies' Hummingbird® technology - an Ethanol-to-Ethylene solution, and Oligomerization jointly developed by the US Department of Energy and LanzaTech. LanzaJet invested in, engineered, built, integrated, and fully operationalized these technologies and the overall integrated solution to efficiently operate the plant as the first commercial-scale fuels facility.

LanzaJet's ATJ technology is designed to work with a broad range of sustainable feedstocks – including agricultural residues, energy crops, municipal solid waste, and captured carbon – to deliver significant lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reductions compared to conventional jet fuel. Once blended with Jet A-1 fuel, the result is a fully certified solution compatible with existing aircraft and infrastructure. LanzaJet is delivering this technology throughout the world including the US, Australia, Japan, India, United Kingdom, Colombia, European Union, Middle East, and Kazakhstan.

Located in Treutlen County in Soperton, Georgia and less than 100 miles from Savannah, LanzaJet invested over $300M to develop this facility which employed more than 300 people during construction and has created more than 65 direct and indirect jobs during ongoing operations.

LanzaJet stands as the culmination of a history of firsts within the SAF industry, dating back to its origins as part of LanzaTech in 2012 as the first ethanol-to-SAF technology which was developed in collaboration with the Pacific Northwest National Lab. That early work enabled lab-, pilot- and demo-scale plants, production of on-spec fuels, the approval of the ethanol-to-SAF pathway by ASTM in 2016, and the technology's first commercial flights which were completed with Virgin Atlantic and All Nippon Airways in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

On 29 October 2025, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (""DESNZ"") published the Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan (the ""Plan"")1– a policy framework setting out how the UK will meet its statutory Carbon Budgets 4 to 6, covering the period 2023 to 2037.

The Plan has been published shortly before states meet at the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties in Belem (COP 30). One of the stated objectives of the Plan is to integrate the UK's national carbon budget with its international commitments on climate change mitigation, including the 2030 and 2035 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. It also marks a renewed phase in UK climate policy, which combines emissions-reduction targets with a growth-oriented industrial strategy. It seeks to accelerate progress toward net zero by 2050, while strengthening energy security, lowering household bills, and positioning the UK as a global destination for clean-energy investment.

What are carbon budgets?

Under the Climate Change Act 2008, the UK is legally bound to cap its total greenhouse gas emissions within successive five-year ""carbon budgets."" These budgets serve as interim milestones to ensure the UK remains on course for its long-term net-zero target. Each budget is set 12 years in advance based on recommendations from the Climate Change Committee and is legally binding, making them a central pillar of the UK's climate governance framework.

The UK is currently operating within Carbon Budget 4 (2023-2027) and is broadly on track to comply. Carbon Budget 6 (2033-2037) was set in 2021, and the level for Carbon Budget 7 (2038-2042) must be confirmed by June 2026. These legally binding limits provide the structural pathway for climate policy, shaping regulation, investment priorities and compliance obligations across the economy.

Why do they matter?

Carbon budgets translate the UK's long-term net-zero ambition into enforceable and intermediate targets, which create a structured pathway for emissions reduction. They shape government policy, regulatory frameworks and market signals, and also provide clarity and certainty for key stakeholders navigating the energy transition. The adequacy and transparency of previous UK carbon budgets have been subject to legal scrutiny in the English courts, with questions raised about their compliance with statutory requirements under the Climate Change Act.

What the Plan Proposes

The Plan outlines how the Government intends to deliver the UK's carbon budgets while driving economic growth and energy resilience. It consolidates over 300 policies and proposals across key sectors, such as power, industry, transport, heat and land use, which reflects a more integrated approach than previous climate strategies. Central themes include:

Energy security and diversification: with continued emphasis on scaling up renewable generation, nuclear power and low-carbon hydrogen. The Plan identifies key national infrastructure priorities, including the delivery of Sizewell C in East Anglia and the expansion of carbon-capture and storage projects in the North West and North East, both viewed as essential to maintaining stable baseload supply and supporting industrial decarbonisation.

Economic growth through clean technology: highlighting the UK's ambition to position itself as a global leader in green finance and net-zero innovation. The Plan forecasts the creation of 400,000 new jobs by 2030, underpinned by major investments in offshore-wind infrastructure in Wales and Scotland, grid upgrades and manufacturing of electric vehicle components.

Transport and industry: the Plan also highlights measures to decarbonise hard-to-abate sectors, including aviation. The forthcoming Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate came into effect in 2025, requiring SAF to comprise 2% of total UK jet fuel demand, rising linearly to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040. The mandate is intended to stimulate innovation in advanced fuels, promote the diversification of feedstocks and reduce reliance on limited bio-based resources. Beyond its emissions benefits, the policy is designed to attract private investment in domestic SAF production facilities and to position the UK as a competitive hub for low-carbon aviation fuel production and technology.

The Plan follows a period of legal and political scrutiny over earlier government climate strategies, which courts found insufficient under the Climate Change Act 2008. This iteration is therefore more data-driven and designed to be litigation-resilient, setting out clearer sectoral milestones, accountability mechanisms and evidence-based modelling to demonstrate compliance with statutory carbon budgets.

Financing and Investor Signalling

For the first time, the Plan is accompanied by a dedicated Investor Prospectus4 aimed at translating the UK's climate ambition into clear investment opportunities and financing pathways. The Investor Prospectus was developed with the Department for Business and Trade's Office for Investment and provides high-level guidance on where investors (from institutional financiers to infrastructure developers) can identify opportunities within the UK's net-zero transition.

In the coming months, DESNZ is expected to release a series of detailed sector factsheets, providing further clarity on policy interventions, timelines and anticipated impacts on power, heat, buildings, transport and industry.

For market participants, the Investor Prospectus signals a more transparent, partnership-based model for climate investment. It may potentially also inform due diligence and financing assumptions, particularly for long-term infrastructure and energy projects.

UK Methane Action Plan

Published in parallel, the UK Methane Action Plan5 complements the Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan by focusing on reducing methane emissions domestically and internationally. It sets out actions across agriculture, energy and waste, which are sectors responsible for a significant share of the UK's methane output, and also reaffirms the UK's commitment to the Global Methane Pledge, which targets a 30% global reduction by 2030 from 2020 levels. Recent efforts include the UK being elected Co-Chair of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition alongside Brazil in February 2025, signalling a strengthened commitment to international collaboration, as well as the promotion of the use of Earth Observation technologies to improve the monitoring and verification of methane emissions, a move intended to enhance transparency and data-driven policymaking. Connections and comparisons will be drawn with the EU Methane Reduction Regulation (MERR), discussed here.

Conclusion

The Plan sets a clearer pathway for how the UK intends to meet its statutory carbon budgets while promoting investment and energy security. In the suite of documents accompanying the Plan, the Government has also published a report on ""Unlocking the benefits of the clean energy economy""6, setting out the government's overarching strategy to reduce emissions to enhance energy security and create economic growth, as well as its response to the Climate Change Committee's Progress Report.7 Together, the Plan provides greater policy transparency for investors and businesses, particularly across the power, industry and transport sectors. However, delivery will depend on timely implementation of enabling regulation and funding mechanisms. It is important that organisations operating in affected sectors monitor upcoming DESNZ updates, which will define the detailed measures needed to achieve the UK's net-zero trajectory.

This innovative approach promises not only to divert mountains of trash from landfills but also to power airplanes with up to 90% lower emissions compared to conventional jet fuel, offering a compelling pathway toward a cleaner, more circular economy for air travel.

The Dual Challenge: Waste Crisis and Aviation Emissions

Cities worldwide grapple with ever-increasing volumes of municipal solid waste, a complex stream of organic matter, plastics, paper, and other materials. Traditionally, much of this waste ends up in landfills, consuming valuable land and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions through decomposition, or is incinerated, which can contribute to air pollution. Simultaneously, the aviation sector faces intense pressure to reduce its environmental footprint. Airplanes currently account for approximately 2.5% of global planet-warming gas pollution, and without significant intervention, these emissions are projected to more than double in the coming decades as air travel demand surges.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has emerged as a critical solution for decarbonizing aviation. Unlike traditional jet fuel derived from fossil sources, SAF is produced from renewable and waste-derived resources, such as agricultural residue, used cooking oil, forestry waste, animal fats, and critically, municipal solid waste.

The Science of Turning Trash into Thrust

The conversion of municipal solid waste into jet fuel is a sophisticated process that typically involves several key stages, predominantly relying on thermochemical conversion technologies.

Gasification: Breaking Down the Waste

The journey begins with gasification, where pre-processed MSW is heated in a controlled, oxygen-limited environment. This process breaks down the solid, carbon-rich waste into a synthesis gas, or “syngas,” primarily composed of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. This initial step is considered a core technical challenge in biomass energy development due to the heterogeneous nature of municipal waste. Improvements in gasification systems are crucial for scaling up this technology.

Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis: Rebuilding Molecules

Following gasification, the syngas enters a Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reactor. Here, with the aid of catalysts, the carbon monoxide and hydrogen molecules undergo a polymerization reaction, combining to form long-chain hydrocarbons. These hydrocarbons are the building blocks for various fuels.

Refining and Hydrocracking: Tailoring for Aviation

The hydrocarbons produced in the Fischer-Tropsch process then undergo further refining, often through a step called hydrocracking. This process breaks down the long-chain hydrocarbons into the precise molecular structure required for jet fuel (kerosene). The resulting fuel is chemically very similar to conventional jet fuel, allowing it to be a “drop-in” fuel that can be blended with regular jet fuel (currently up to 50% for commercial flights, though 100% can be used on modern airliners) and used in existing aircraft engines and airport infrastructure without modification.

Significant Emissions Reduction and Environmental Benefits

Studies, including one published in Nature Sustainability, indicate that converting municipal solid waste into sustainable aviation fuel can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80-90% compared to conventional jet fuel on a life cycle basis. This substantial reduction stems from both the sustainable sourcing of the fuel and the diversion of waste from landfills, which are a major source of methane—a potent greenhouse gas.

Beyond carbon emissions, waste-to-jet fuel also offers additional environmental advantages. The production process can lead to a 90% reduction in particulate matter emissions during combustion, contributing to improved air quality around airports. Moreover, by repurposing waste, this technology promotes a circular economy, conserves landfill space, and reduces pollution pressure on watersheds when wet wastes are utilized.

Global Potential and Economic Outlook

The potential impact of waste-to-jet fuel is significant. Researchers estimate that globally, more than 62.5 billion liters of trash-based jet fuel could be produced annually, which could cut global aviation pollution by 16%. If green hydrogen is integrated into the process, production could reach 80 million tons per year, potentially supplying up to 28% of global jet fuel demand and reducing emissions by as much as 270 million tons of carbon dioxide annually.

Several companies are actively pursuing waste-to-jet fuel solutions. LanzaJet, Neste, World Energy, Gevo, and Alder Fuels are among the key players in the sustainable aviation fuel space, developing innovative technologies and scaling up production. Partnerships, such as the one between NetJets and WasteFuel, aim to establish biorefineries that convert municipal waste into SAF, with targets of converting millions of tons of waste into tens of millions of gallons of SAF annually.

Challenges and the Path Forward

Despite its immense promise, widespread adoption of waste-to-jet fuel faces hurdles. The primary challenge remains cost, with SAF often being significantly more expensive than fossil jet fuel. Scaling up the complex gasification process for diverse waste streams is also a technical challenge that researchers are actively working to overcome. Furthermore, ensuring a consistent and high-quality feedstock supply from municipal waste requires robust waste management and sorting systems.

Overcoming these challenges will require continued research and development, supportive policies, and financial incentives to make SAF cost-competitive and to scale up production facilities. The “waste-to-fuel” approach is a critical step in the aviation industry’s journey toward net-zero emissions, offering a tangible way to clean up the skies while simultaneously addressing one of humanity’s most persistent environmental problems. The opportunity to turn a negative-value waste stream into a high-value energy asset is a powerful driver for this sustainable transition.",https://enertherm-engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/file-569.png,N,,2025-11-13 12:57:03.577045

By 2024, that number had soared to 9.5 billion, and projections from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and Airports Council International (ACI) suggest global air #travel could reach 22.3 billion passengers by 2053, nearly 2.4 times today’s volume.

Growth is driven by expanding middle-class travel in emerging markets, new routes, and the strengthening of global tourism networks. Yet, this expansion also brings challenges. Airlines remain committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) still meets less than 0.5% of fuel demand, with high costs and limited supply slowing progress.

As the world advances, balancing accessibility with sustainability will define the next era of global aviation, where progress in the skies must also entail responsibility on the ground.

According to the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy will apply to out-bound passengers, but not transit passengers, from 1 October 2026.

The amount charged will depend on the distance flown – with four geographical bands – and the cabin of travel. Premium cabin passengers, which includes business and first class, will pay four times more than economy cabin fliers, which includes both economy and premium economy.

The four bands are as follows: Southeast Asia; Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia and Papua New Guinea; Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, Middle East, Pacific Islands and New Zealand; and the Americas.

Those flying to Southeast Asia in economy will pay S$1 (59p), while those travelling in a premium cabin to the Americas will pay S$41.60 (£24.35).

The decision to charge premium cabin passengers four times more comes from the IATA Passenger CO2 Calculation Methodology for working out the carbon emissions of passengers.

Han Kok Juan, Director-General of CAAS said, “The introduction of the SAF Levy marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub. It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub. We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.”

The money collected will go into a SAF Fund managed by CAAS, which will be used to purchase sustainable fuel.

It specialises in aerospace, building technologies, industrial automation and energy solutions.

Through all of its operations, it follows its sustainability guidelines, with the aim of becoming carbon neutral by 2035.

Honeywell has been named 39th in Sustainability Magazine’s Top 250 World’s Most Sustainable Companies 2025.

Honeywell’s sustainability goals

Honeywell’s environmental priorities include the impact of its products and services, decarbonisation and its climate strategy.

It aims to be carbon neutral in its facilities and operations by 2035 and it has set emissions goals that are validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

These targets are to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2037 from a 2019 base year and to reduce absolute Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 23% within the same timeframe.

In 2025, it achieved a more than 90% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas intensity since 2004.

It has also developed more than 6,800 efficiency, emissions reduction, water and waste projects since 2010.

The company predicts that its technologies will have a cumulative impact of mitigating two billion metric tons of CO2e between 2023 and 2030.

This is 175 times Honeywell’s projected Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions over the same period.

Vimal Kapur, Chairman and CEO at Honeywell, says: “From our efforts to increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to our work to minimise waste and conserve water, our commitment to environmental responsibility plays an important role in our efforts to drive growth across our operations.

Today, the prospects for the sector are more favourable in Europe.

While the SAF market in Europe has continued to gain momentum over the past year, sentiment in the US has cooled following the anti-climate stance of the Trump administration.

In Europe, visibility into revenues for SAF producers is getting clearer, while their US counterparts have spent 2025 shrouded in uncertainty.

Despite this, US corporates have been putting more money into funding initiatives for SAF. Just last month, a coalition of aviation players got together to launch the $150m Oneworld BEV Fund, anchored by American Airlines and Alaskan Airlines, and managed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures. That followed another group of corporates that backed the $100m United Airlines Sustainable Aviation Fund in 2023, which gained more LPs from the industry over the following year.

Regulatory cliff

But a US-based SAF investor was downbeat about the SAF market in the US. “It’s a different market from November of last year, that’s probably what the decisive turning point was,” says the investor, referring to Donald Trump’s election victory, which pulled a curtain down over sustainability initiatives backed by the US federal government, including subsidies for SAF developers.

“When the notion of the fund first got started, the regulatory environment, particularly in the United States, was much different,” says the SAF-focused investor.

“All this stuff takes lots of capital, and that capital really was going to be unlocked by virtue of government support, in one form or another, that was going to underpin the funding for it. That support has waned,” he says.

Federal tax credits in the US for sustainable fuels such as the 45Z credits under the Inflation Reduction Act which are given per gallon of SAF produced are less certain than they would have been when some startups last raised money. The new administration’s Treasury Department gave guidance earlier this year that softened expectations for the eligibility of certain feedstocks, and legislative proposals are in the works that might cap the credit-per-gallon below where it was expected.

45Z credits are meant to start this year but are set to expire in 2027 unless extended. That might change depending on the results of the mid-term elections.

At the state level, there are low carbon fuel standards (LCFS), which incentivise producers to lower the average lifecycle carbon intensity of their fuels below a declining annual target.

While LCFS rules are legally independent from federal regulations, the value of the credits is not unaffected by federal regulations. If 45Z support goes down, LCFS credits can actually become more valuable because there is less supply of credits overall, but any state-level increase would not likely compensate for the loss of federal support.

The SAF investor tells GCV that their portfolio companies do have enough liquidity for the next couple of years. For now, they’re in a holding pattern, watching to see how regulations evolve.

By contrast, European players are more confident. Both the UK and the EU have incremental blending mandates that are starting to kick in. The UK SAF mandate requires 2% of the UK’s aviation fuel demand to be met with SAF, ratcheting up to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040.

The EU’s ReFuelEU mandate starts slower but then accelerates faster than the UK’s, requiring 2% of member states’ fuel to be met with SAF this year, increasing to 6% by 2030, 34% by 2040, and 70% by 2050.

A European startup that recently raised funds is UK-based OXCCU, a company developing technology to convert carbon into fuels and chemicals. Its recent $28m series B saw more participation from corporates including Eni, Aramco, IAG, Safran, and Orlen compared with its series A. Encouraged by the success of its OX1 pilot plant at London Oxford Airport, it is seeking to open its second, larger demonstration plant next year.

Apart from OXCCU, other European SAF startups to get funded this year include Norwegian SAF producer Wastefront and Swiss SAF technology company Metafuels.

Tech advances

While SAF policy is progressing by fits and starts, the technology to produce low carbon aviation fuel is making headway. Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids and eSAF have expanded the feedstock landscape. A large amount of money is still needed to build out commercial-scale facilities, although it may prove to be cheaper to retrofit existing refineries that are not making money.

SAF producers are seeking to change the kind of feedstocks they are using. Regulators and entrepreneurs are prioritising carbon feedstocks such as biogas, waste wood, agricultural waste and captured CO2 because they don’t bring the challenges of food displacement that crop-based bio-fuels do.

“We can start from biomethane or CO2, and I don’t think CO2 is in short supply,” says Nacho Gimenez, COO at OXCCU, who previously considered investments in SAF while an investor at BP Ventures and energy investor DTEK. The problem becomes more a logistical one of capturing the carbon and transporting it than sourcing it in the first place, he adds.

Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) is increasingly popular because it takes waste products such as used cooking oil, fatty streams from industrial waste, and other fats and vegetable oils, and can heavily reduce the lifecycle emissions.

But the availability of sustainable feedstock for hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids compared with other feedstocks such as cultivated palm oil is not enough to meet demand. It is also more costly.

eSAF is also gaining popularity because it is made with renewable hydrogen and captured CO2, typically reducing emissions by at least 70% compared with jet fuel. It circumvents the supply constraints of hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids and benefits from a sub-mandate for synthetic fuels under ReFuelEU.

Wider outlook

The price of SAF production is still high, requiring economies of scale and large capex.

The price of jet fuel is tied to oil, while the ultimate price of SAF is determined by negotiated contracts.

The capex for building the production infrastructure will only come if investors see that offtake contracts are available at a good price. And at least in the US, where there is no federal blending mandate, that’s even harder to picture than in Europe. Some US investors are taking a step back to see where things go before committing more capital.

“We’ve laid our bets around the space [in terms of technologies], but the market kind of in a trough right now as it relates to climate tech, and sustainability in particular,” says the SAF investor.

“We’re being very prudent and measured with where we deploy capital going forward.”

But, even in Europe, if the costs aren’t brought down by the time the heavier mandates kick in, those costs will be passed on to consumers. Volume by itself is not enough, it will be the most cost-efficient startups that succeed.

“Once we get to those blending levels of 2040, it will not be the biggest SAF producers that thrive, but it will be the most economic producers,” says Gimenez.",https://globalventuring.com/content/uploads/2025/11/Feature-lead-image.png,N,,2025-11-13 07:56:27.321146

Highlighting India’s 750 million tonnes of biomass capacity, he said the country could emerge as a global leader in SAF production, cutting carbon emissions and crude oil imports while creating up to one million green jobs.

Speaking at the India Sustainable Aviation Fuel Summit organised by FICCI in partnership with the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the Minister underlined the urgent need for clarity, collaboration, and commitment among all stakeholders to meet the aviation sector’s growing energy demand.

“The aviation sector continues to expand faster than most other transport segments, with an annual growth rate of 6.7 per cent and nearly 10 million passenger trips expected in 2025,” said Kinjarapu. “Our ATF consumption is projected to reach 15–16 million tonnes by 2030 and 30–31 million tonnes by 2040. The solution lies in Sustainable Aviation Fuel, which can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuels.”

He confirmed that the Ministry is finalising the SAF policy to accelerate adoption. “The Ministry has been taking robust steps to speed up the SAF movement, and we are committed to releasing the SAF policy soon,” he stated.

Highlighting India’s potential, Kinjarapu said that as an agricultural powerhouse generating over 750 million tonnes of biomass, the country can become a global leader in SAF production. This transition, he said, could reduce India’s crude oil import bill by US$ 5–7 billion annually and generate around one million green jobs across the SAF value chain.

Over the past nine years, India has added 90 airports and 400 aircraft, while scheduled flight movements have risen by 78 per cent . The government plans to add 50 airports in the next five years and 200 more over the next two decades, with passenger traffic projected to reach 500 million annually.

Faiz Ahmed Kidwai, Director General of Civil Aviation, noted that decarbonising aviation is a shared global responsibility. “Our ambition to achieve a 5 per cent SAF blending target by 2030 is not just a goal but a declaration of intent to lead by example,” he said.

Adding an industry perspective, Jurgen Westermeier, Chairman, FICCI National Civil Aviation Committee and President & MD, Airbus India & South Asia, called SAF a transformative opportunity. “For India, SAF goes beyond environmental targets—it can enhance energy security and sovereignty,” he said.

Ashish Saraf, Co-Chairman, FICCI Civil Aviation Committee and Vice President & Country Head India, Pratt & Whitney, added, “Sustainable Aviation Fuel is the cornerstone of India’s Net Zero aviation story. It can reduce emissions by up to two-thirds, positioning India as a global SAF hub.”

Municipal solid waste as a feedstock Municipal solid waste includes organic matter like food scraps and paper as well as plastics and metals.
Ultimately, sustainable aviation fuel currently makes up less than 1% of global jet fuel use, mainly because of its high production costs.","Aviation currently contributes about 2.5% of total global carbon emissions, and with air travel demand expected to double by 2040, cutting those emissions has become a pressing priority. One path forward is sustainable aviation fuel, a low-carbon alternative made from feedstocks such as used cooking oil and crops. But despite its potential, sustainable aviation fuel makes up less than 1% of global jet fuel use, mainly due to high production costs and limited supply.

A new study in Nature Sustainability points to a promising breakthrough: using municipal solid waste as a reliable, low-emission, cost-effective feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel.

Researchers from Tsinghua University and the Harvard-China Project on Energy, Economy, and Environment evaluated municipal solid waste-based jet fuel produced through industrial-scale gasification and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. A life cycle analysis found that jet fuel made from municipal waste could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80–90% compared with conventional jet fuel. The main technical hurdle lies in scaling up gasification systems for widespread use.

""Unlike road transport, which is quickly shifting toward electrification, there's no silver-bullet solution for achieving carbon-neutral aviation,"" said Jingran Zhang, the study's first author and a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard-China Project who is supported by the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability at Harvard. ""Turning everyday trash into jet fuel could be an innovative but major near-term step toward cleaner aviation. By converting municipal waste into low-carbon jet fuel that already works in today's engines, we can start cutting emissions immediately, without waiting for future technology.""

Municipal solid waste as a feedstock

Municipal solid waste includes organic matter like food scraps and paper as well as plastics and metals. Traditionally, much of this waste has been landfilled or incinerated, which consumes land or can contribute to air pollution. As landfill space shrinks and waste generation rises, converting municipal solid waste into liquid fuels could conserve land, cut emissions, and produce cleaner energy to help cities move toward zero-waste goals.

The Harvard study explores the largely under-researched potential of municipal solid waste-based jet fuel using real-world data on Fischer-Tropsch gasification technology. The researchers analyzed key emission sources, calculated greenhouse gas impacts, and identified ways to boost efficiency.

They found that while the process significantly lowers emissions, only about 33% of input carbon is converted into fuel due to gas composition mismatches. Efficiency could be improved by capturing carbon dioxide or adding green hydrogen, produced with renewable power, during processing.

Global implications

Many countries are ramping up efforts to make aviation more sustainable by adopting cleaner fuels. In the United States, the government aims to produce up to 35 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuels annually by 2050, supported by strong financial incentives. In the European Union, new regulations will require all departing flights to gradually increase their share of sustainable aviation fuels, catapulting from 2% in 2025 to 70% by 2050. On a global scale, the International Civil Aviation Organization's CORSIA program requires operators to offset emissions growth, which they can do by buying eligible offsets or by using sustainable fuels.

The study examined how municipal solid waste could be converted into sustainable aviation fuel under several scenarios. In the most practical case, global municipal solid waste could yield around 50 million tons (62 billion liters) of jet fuel globally, cutting aviation's greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 16%. If waste management and conversion systems are inefficient, the benefits drop substantially.

However, if green hydrogen is integrated into the process, production could reach 80 million tons per year, which is enough to supply up to 28% of global jet fuel demand and reduce emissions by as much as 270 million tons of carbon dioxide annually.

In Europe, the projected output would already exceed the European Union's jet fuel-blending targets while remaining compliant with sustainability standards. Economically, the study suggests that adopting municipal solid waste-based jet fuels could save airlines money under carbon pricing systems like CORSIA, particularly when government incentives and subsidies are factored in.

Ultimately, sustainable aviation fuel currently makes up less than 1% of global jet fuel use, mainly because of its high production costs. This underscores the urgent need for strong policy action and financial incentives to scale up supply.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2025/airplane-wing.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 10:57:40.008757

The October fuel deliveries mark the company’s second and third major SAF deployments at U.S. airports within six months, following its first deployment at Los Angeles International Airport in May.

“Each executed agreement signals to fuel producers that airlines are willing and eager collaborators to help scale the SAF market,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, FedEx chief sustainability officer and vice president of Environmental Affairs. “The aviation industry still faces a mismatch between available SAF supply and carrier demand, but we are encouraged by early signs of increased SAF production globally this year.”

Chicago-O’Hare International Airport

At O’Hare, FedEx will receive a total of one million gallons of neat SAF blended at a minimum 30% mix from Air bp. With its first delivery in October, FedEx became the first U.S. all-cargo airline to purchase and deploy SAF at the airport.

“Existing fuel infrastructure and enabling policy conditions at the state level made sourcing SAF at O’Hare a logical next step in our alternative fuel procurement strategy,” Blanks Ellis said.

Miami International Airport

At Miami International Airport, FedEx has started receiving approximately three million gallons of blended SAF at a minimum 30% blend from AEG.

“With FedEx flights from Miami serving Latin America and the Caribbean daily, we are proud to see our Miami hub leading the way in sustainable fuel adoption,” said Luiz R. Vasconcelos, president of FedEx Latin America and the Caribbean. “This milestone reinforces our commitment and shows our customers that sustainability is not just a corporate goal—it is a regional priority. From SAF deployment in Miami to the rollout of electric delivery vehicles in Mexico, Colombia, Chile, and Brazil, we are embedding sustainable innovation across our operations and contributing to our global sustainability strategy.”

SAF Part of Broader Aviation Sustainability Efforts

Neat SAF is mixed with traditional jet fuel before use, while blended SAF is a “drop-in” fuel that does not require changes to aircraft engines or fueling infrastructure. FedEx aims to source 30% of its fuel from alternative sources, on a blended basis, by 2030.

SAF is a key part of FedEx’s broader aviation sustainability and fuel efficiency strategy. While SAF and conventional jet fuel have similar emissions profiles when burned, SAF production can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared with conventional fuels. To meet industry-wide emissions goals, airlines must also focus on reducing overall fuel consumption and improving operational efficiency alongside SAF adoption.

Aircraft modernization and other fuel-saving initiatives allowed FedEx to avoid using 140 million gallons of jet fuel in FY 2024, saving the company $400 million. In the same year, FedEx met its previous target of reducing aircraft emissions intensity by 30% from a 2005 baseline and has since set a new goal of a 40% reduction by 2034.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-7.png,N,,2025-11-13 07:57:14.575017

This levy will support the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel, and help reduce carbon emissions in the aviation sector. By charging passengers a small fee, the government ensures that the costs of transitioning to greener aviation practices are fairly distributed. This initiative positions Singapore as a global leader in aviation sustainability, setting an example for other nations and marking a significant milestone in efforts to reduce the environmental impact of air travel.

In a groundbreaking move, Singapore is introducing a “green fuel levy” on flights departing from Changi Airport, starting from April 2026. This levy, aimed at funding the transition to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), marks a significant step in the aviation industry’s efforts to address climate change. As one of the first countries to incorporate environmental accountability into flight pricing, Singapore is setting a global example for how major air hubs can balance the demand for air travel with the need for sustainability. While the levy is modest, it signifies a major shift in how airlines and passengers will approach eco-conscious flying.

What Is the Green Fuel Levy?

The green fuel levy is a new charge introduced by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) to support the use of sustainable aviation fuel. SAF is a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel, derived from renewable, low-carbon sources such as waste biomass and used cooking oil. SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle compared to conventional jet fuel. However, it is still significantly more expensive to produce. To bridge this cost gap, the green fuel levy will be applied to all departing flights from Singapore, with the funds earmarked solely for the purchase of SAF.

The levy varies based on the distance of the flight and the class of travel. For example, passengers in economy or premium economy class will pay between S$1 (approximately Rs 68) for short regional flights and S$10.40 (around Rs 700) for long-haul journeys, such as those to the Americas. Business and first-class travellers will pay more, ranging from S$4 (Rs 270) to S$41.60 (around Rs 2,800), reflecting the higher fuel consumption associated with longer, more energy-intensive flights. Cargo flights are also subject to the levy, with charges ranging from S$0.01 to S$0.15 per kilogram, depending on the flight distance.

Key Dates and Applicability of the Green Fuel Levy

The green fuel levy officially takes effect from October 2026, but it will only apply to tickets issued from April 1, 2026, onward. Passengers who book tickets before this date will not be subject to the levy, even if their flight departs after the policy is implemented. The levy is applicable exclusively to flights departing from Singapore, meaning transit passengers who only pass through Changi Airport will not be required to pay the charge. For transparency, the levy will be clearly listed as a separate line item on flight tickets, ensuring passengers are fully informed of the additional cost.

The Rationale Behind the Green Fuel Levy

Singapore, as one of Asia’s busiest and most strategically important aviation hubs, plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of sustainable aviation. The levy is designed to help Singapore achieve its target of using sustainable aviation fuel for 1% of the country’s total jet fuel consumption by 2026, with plans to increase this figure to 3-5% by 2030. The initiative is in line with Singapore’s broader sustainability goals, which aim to reduce carbon emissions and improve the environmental footprint of air travel.

By introducing the green fuel levy, Singapore is also spreading the cost of greener air travel in a fair and transparent way. Rather than placing the burden solely on airlines or taxpayers, the government is asking passengers to contribute to the cost of cleaner aviation. This ensures that the transition to sustainable fuel remains financially viable while making a tangible impact on the country’s carbon reduction targets. The funds collected through the levy will be dedicated exclusively to the procurement of SAF, ensuring that the money is used efficiently and effectively for its intended purpose.

What Does the Green Fuel Levy Mean for Travellers?

For most passengers, the impact of the green fuel levy will be relatively small. The additional charge for economy class travellers ranges from Rs 68 to Rs 700, depending on the flight’s length. While this may be an additional expense, it is minimal compared to the overall cost of a flight ticket, especially for long-haul trips. For business and first-class passengers, the levy is higher, reflecting the larger carbon footprint of these more premium services.

One key point for travellers to remember is that tickets purchased before April 1, 2026, will not include the levy, even if the flight is scheduled after the policy comes into effect. This gives passengers some time to plan and adjust their travel arrangements if they wish to avoid the additional charge.

The introduction of the green fuel levy marks a significant shift in the aviation industry, as airlines, airports, and passengers are increasingly being asked to play a role in tackling climate change. By directly funding sustainable aviation fuel, Singapore is helping to pave the way for a greener future in air travel. This initiative not only reduces the environmental impact of flying but also sends a powerful message about the role of the aviation industry in contributing to broader sustainability goals.

Setting a Global Example for Sustainable Aviation

As one of the first countries to introduce a formal green fuel levy, Singapore’s move is likely to set a precedent for other global aviation hubs. The airline industry has long been one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize, with fuel consumption being a significant source of emissions. By integrating environmental costs into flight pricing, Singapore is leading the charge in making sustainable air travel a reality. Other countries and airports around the world will likely follow suit, adopting similar models to support the transition to SAF and reduce the carbon footprint of global aviation.

While the green fuel levy is a small price to pay for most travellers, it represents a significant step toward sustainable air travel. The initiative not only supports Singapore’s ambitious carbon reduction goals but also encourages the global aviation industry to adopt more environmentally responsible practices. By charging passengers a modest fee to fund the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel, Singapore is not just reducing the environmental impact of its own aviation sector—it is helping to drive a global movement toward cleaner, greener skies.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/freepik__the-style-is-candid-ima-2025-11-13T104513283.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 03:57:09.316190

Following the acquisition, TGPL plans to change its name to TruAlt Sumi Gas Private Limited (hereinafter “TSGPL”). TSGPL aims to construct 16 compressed biomethane gas (CBG)*1 production facilities across India over the next three years and commence operations sequentially from 2026. The total daily production capacity of the 16 facilities is expected to reach approximately 320 tons, equivalent to the daily gas consumption of around 800,000 households in India. The raw materials for CBG production will include sugarcane and ethanol residue at TruAlt and other suppliers. The CBG produced will primarily be sold as automobile fuel to major city gas distributors within India. Alongside CBG production, Sumitomo Corporation and TruAlt also plan to collaborate on expanding bioethanol production and producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) derived from bioethanol.

Through its participation in the CBG production business and the bioenergy business in India, Sumitomo Corporation will accelerate the growth of its Energy Solutions Business, one of the key growth areas in its current Medium-Term Management Plan.

Promotion of CBG Supply in India

India, the world's third-largest energy consumer, is aiming to improve its energy self-sufficiency and achieve energy independence by 2047 in view of the country's growing energy demand. CBG is regarded as an important energy source that contributes both to effective waste utilization and improved energy self-sufficiency, as it can be produced from agricultural residue and other waste generated in India, a major agricultural nation. To promote domestic CBG supply, the Indian government has made it mandatory to blend CBG into automobile fuel and city gas for households. City gas distributors in India are required to gradually increase the CBG blending ratio and achieve a 5% CBG mix by 2028. Consequently, expansion of CBG production facilities in India is an urgent priority as the CBG market continues to grow.

Purpose of Investment in TSGPL

TruAlt is India's largest ethanol manufacturer and belongs to the same group with Nirani Sugars, one of India's major sugar producers. The company produces approximately two million liters of ethanol per day. TSGPL expects to achieve stable CBG production by sourcing raw materials such as residue generated during sugar manufacturing and ethanol production from TruAlt and other group companies’ production sites. Sumitomo Corporation will leverage its accumulated expertise and domestic network in India, particularly in the areas of CBG sales and marketing activities and will combine the strengths of both companies to promote CBG production across India.

Future Initiatives

TSGPL will first commence construction of four CBG production facilities in Karnataka and Maharashtra, major sugarcane-producing regions in southern India, while formulating strategies for the expansion of production bases and conducting feasibility studies. Furthermore, by leveraging the knowledge and experience of Sumitomo Corporation and TruAlt, the two companies will also consider future initiatives to expand bioethanol production facilities and produce SAF derived from bioethanol.

In addition, aiming to contribute to the Japan–India Bilateral Credit Mechanism (JCM) agreement signed in August 2025, Sumitomo Corporation will work through TSGPL to generate carbon credits.

Sumitomo Corporation's Bioenergy Business

Sumitomo Corporation positions bioenergy as an important means to achieve carbon neutrality in its business activities by 2050 and to realize a sustainable energy cycle. In June 2025, Sumitomo Corporation established North Sky A/S, a biogas production business in Denmark, marking its first participation in a biogas manufacturing business. In Japan, the company is advancing the Project Morisora, which aims to achieve domestic production of SAF. Sumitomo Corporation has also signed an MOU with Malaysia-based reNIKOLA for bioenergy development and is pursuing development opportunities in numerous countries.

The Energy Innovation Initiative SBU of Sumitomo Corporation will continue to strengthen its efforts in the bioenergy business field.

Gevo originally planned to build a 60 MMgy SAF facility in South Dakota. The company in October 2024 received a conditional commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy for a $1.46 billion loan guarantee to support the project.

According to Gruber, Gevo was recently notified by the DOE that the agency would considering shifting the loan guarantee to the North Dakota project. The North Dakota site presents a strong opportunity for the development of an ethanol-to-jet due to its existing corn ethanol plant and operational onsite carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) operation. Gruber also noted North Dakota’s pro-agriculture and pro-energy environment makes it “an outstanding state in which to do business and grow.”

Gevo earlier this year completed the purchase of the North Dakata ethanol plant, a 67 MMgy facility that was previously known as Red Trail Energy.

Christopher Ryan, president and chief operating officer at Gevo, noted the company’s team is engaged in maintaining, improving and operating the North Dakota facility. Recent improvements include new truck scales, road improvements and efficiency improvements. Plans are also underway for “both incremental and step-change expansions,” Ryan said. This includes expanding corn storage and receiving, expanding carbon sequestration utilization and improving energy efficiency. He also noted that the North Dakota Department of Agriculture has awarded the company more than $3 million to support efforts to improve plant efficiency and expand infrastructure required for build the 30 MMgy SAF facility.

With aviation responsible for a significant portion of global carbon emissions—approximately 2.5%—the pressure to find viable alternatives to traditional jet fuel has never been more urgent. As global air travel demand is projected to double by 2040, the study emphasizes that adopting sustainable aviation fuels could be pivotal in mitigating the aviation sector’s environmental impact.

The research, conducted by a team of experts from Tsinghua University and the Harvard-China Project on Energy, Economy, and Environment, proposes that sustainable aviation fuel derived from municipal solid waste could cut greenhouse gas emissions by an impressive 80-90%. This reduction is in stark contrast to the conventional jet fuels that dominate the market today. The study presents a compelling case for this transformative fuel source, focusing on the industrial processes of gasification and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis as methods to convert everyday waste materials into a viable jet fuel alternative.

Municipal solid waste comprises a myriad of elements, including organic matter, plastics, and metals. Traditionally, this waste has faced disposal challenges, often ending up in landfills or incineration facilities that contribute to various environmental issues, including land degradation and air pollution. As urban areas grapple with shrinking landfill spaces and increasing waste generation, the transition to converting waste into liquid fuels represents a dual opportunity: creating cleaner energy solutions while addressing waste management crises.

The life cycle analysis conducted by the researchers utilizes real-world data pertaining to the gasification processes. Their findings indicate that the conversion of municipal solid waste not only lowers greenhouse gas emissions dramatically but also reveals the complexities associated with the efficiency of the gasification technology. Despite the significant positive outcomes, they found that only about one-third of the input carbon could be effectively converted into usable jet fuel due to inherent challenges in gas composition. However, the study also points toward potential enhancements in efficiency, suggesting that the integration of carbon capture technologies or the inclusion of green hydrogen could significantly improve output.

One of the most notable aspects of this research is its global implications. The United States has already outlined ambitious goals, aiming for the production of up to 35 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuels annually by 2050. This initiative will be propelled by strong financial incentives designed to encourage industry participation and innovation. Similarly, the European Union is set to enforce regulations requiring departing flights to progressively incorporate an increasing share of sustainable aviation fuels, starting from 2% in 2025 and escalating to an astonishing 70% by 2050.

The researchers evaluated various scenarios to understand how municipal solid waste could be converted into sustainable aviation fuel. In the most promising scenario, the global accumulation of municipal solid waste could yield up to 50 million tons (approximately 62 billion liters) of jet fuel, significantly slashing greenhouse gas emissions from aviation. However, they caution that erratic waste management practices could reduce these projected benefits substantially. Conversely, should efficient waste processing and conversion be implemented, particularly with green hydrogen integration, the potential production could skyrocket to 80 million tons annually, enough to meet 28% of global jet fuel requirements and curtail emissions by an impressive 270 million tons of carbon dioxide each year.

From an economic standpoint, this research underscores the tangible benefits that airlines could experience by shifting toward municipal solid waste-derived jet fuels. With various carbon pricing policies such as the CORSIA program implemented by the International Civil Aviation Organization, airlines would stand to save substantially under these initiatives, especially when considering government support and subsidies aimed at fostering a more sustainable aviation sector.

As the industry faces pressure to innovate and reduce emissions, the findings of this study provide a roadmap for future developments in sustainable aviation fuels. The lead author of the study, Michael B. McElroy, a distinguished environmental studies professor at Harvard, emphasizes the necessity of collaboration among stakeholders. From governments to fuel producers, airlines, and aircraft manufacturers, a synergistic approach will be crucial to scaling production and ultimately decreasing costs.

Designed to initiate discussions on sustainable aviation fuel production methods, this research also calls for increased awareness of waste’s potential as a resource rather than a liability. By reimagining municipal solid waste, this transformative approach sets the stage for an aviation sector that is not just cleaner but also more economically sustainable. It raises a critical question about how society views waste—which is often regarded as a problem— suggesting instead that it could be re-envisioned as a valuable asset in the fight against climate change.

Furthermore, this study highlights the broader social and environmental implications of utilizing municipal solid waste. It positions cleaner jet fuel production within the context of global environmental goals, such as achieving zero waste in urban areas, conserving land, and generating cleaner energy sources. With the effects of climate change already apparent, catalyzing investment in this research domain could encourage a much-needed realignment of how societies manage waste and energy.

In conclusion, as the aviation industry navigates the complex requirements of sustainability amidst rising emissions, the shift towards municipal solid waste-derived sustainable aviation fuels opens up new avenues for environmental stewardship and economic opportunity. The collaboration outlined by researchers may not only unlock the full potential of this innovative fuel pathway but could also inspire a global movement towards rethinking waste management practices.

At Chicago, FedEx will initially receive one million gallons of blended fuel from Air bp, while Miami will see deliveries of about three million gallons from AEG.

“Each executed agreement signals to fuel producers that airlines are willing and eager collaborators to help scale the SAF market,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, FedEx chief sustainability officer, in a company statement.

Broader U.S. Adoption

The development follows Neste’s recent expansion of its partnership with United Airlines to supply SAF to Houston, Newark, and Washington Dulles airports. The partnership builds on previous deliveries in Chicago and San Francisco.

“Introducing sustainable aviation fuel for the first time at our hubs in Houston, Newark, and Dulles is another significant milestone,” said United Chief Sustainability Officer Lauren Riley.

U.S. producers including Valero and Montana Renewables have recently increased capacity, while distributor Avfuel has expanded its SAF supply networks to eight locations nationwide. State programs in California, Oregon, Washington, and others provide ongoing incentives as federal grant funding incentivizing the fuel decreases.

SAF adoption faces major hurdles where cost gaps between it and traditional fuels exist. Although funds and legislative measures look to address this issue, it is still a major roadblock, particularly where legislation does not play a strong role in local markets. Shell, for instance, cited the cost gap in its decision to halt work on a major European plant in September.

SAF Funds and Global Legislation

Internationally, several recently formed funds and legislative measures look to accelerate adoption.

A partnership between Breakthrough Energy Ventures, oneworld alliance, and several individual member airlines launched an investment fund initially worth $150 million in September that aims to expedite SAF commercialization.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, meanwhile, announced the formation of a central Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company that will purchase and distribute SAF departing its major airports.

As people continue to fly more and more, MHIAEL is set to take off alongside them.","People want to fly. They want to travel, explore and connect and modern air travel is simply the most efficient – and often the only practical – way to do so.

The numbers bear this out: in 2024, global air traffic, measured in Revenue Passenger Kilometers (RPK), grew more than 10%(link is external) year-over-year, exceeding the pre-pandemic peak of 2019. So far this year, RPKs are up 5%(link is external), with international flights 7% higher and Asian airlines reporting an increase of almost 10%.

Clearly, the strong relationship between RPK growth and global GDP growth continues to hold, with the former expanding several percentage points faster every year. The COVID-19 pandemic that challenged our industry so brutally a few years ago, now looks like a blip. This gives us confidence in our prognosis that the market for aero engines, our particular business line, is set to double over the next two decades.

We believe this will remain the case despite growing pressure on the aviation sector, which is responsible for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, to decarbonize. Some critics are even calling for an outright reduction in air travel to reduce emissions, such as the Swedish-inspired ‘flygskam’ or ‘flight shame’ movement. The reality, though, is that the most effective way to reduce emissions is for a profitable industry to continue to invest in increasing efficiency as well as into low-carbon technology.

Already, the introduction of geared turbofan engines™, high-pressure ratio core engines and very high-bypass ratio engines has significantly improved fuel efficiency, leading to a double-digit reduction in fuel consumption with each new generation of engines. The next step is to blend sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), produced from used cooking oil and biowaste, with traditional kerosene to power today’s engines. And longer term, the industry is working on electric and hydrogen-fueled propulsion systems, though these will be limited to smaller, short-haul aircraft – at least initially.

Grounded in partnerships

Our task at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Aero Engines, Ltd. (MHIAEL) is to contribute to the aviation sector’s growth and sustainability by helping to design and build the most advanced and efficient engines possible. In a business that requires a lot of upfront investment and R&D and then faces operational risks over the many years that an engine flies, the only way to succeed is in partnership.

That is why MHIAEL is much more than a supplier. We are either a risk and revenue sharing partner (RRSP) or an outright joint venture (JV) partner in all of the engine programs in which we participate. In the case of Pratt & Whitney’s PW1100G-JM engine series, which powers the Airbus A320neo family – the world’s most popular narrowbody aircraft – we are part of a JV that includes five companies from the US, Germany and Japan.

Our collaboration with Rolls-Royce, which currently stretches over three Trent engine programs for widebody planes, including the Boeing 787 Dreamliner as well as the A330neo and A350XWB, is structured as a series of RRSPs.

Across these programs, revenues and, indeed, risks are shared in proportion to each partner’s share, with Japan’s three ‘Heavies’ – Kawasaki Heavy Industries, IHI and MHIAEL – often accounting for around a one quarter share. In addition, each company designs and builds a part of the engine.

Our focus is on what I like to think of as the ‘heart of the engine’: the combustors and combustion chamber, where fuel is mixed with high-pressure air and ignited to create the high-temperature exhaust gases that drive the turbine. The fact that we are part of MHI Group, the world’s leading manufacturer of large-scale gas turbines for power stations, is key to our ability to design and build these critical components. And we collaborate actively with colleagues at MHI’s Research & Innovation Center to ensure we retain our technological edge.

A factory on autopilot

Another strength is the heavy investment at MHIAEL’s main locations in Nagoya and Nagasaki, into both component production and our maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facilities – ensuring the highest standards and, hence, smooth approval from the world’s key aviation regulators.

Our new Nagasaki factory, completed five years ago, where we make the combustion chambers for the PW1100G-JM, is probably the most modern in the entire MHI Group. The 280-meter-long building is filled with machine tools – from high-speed lasers to high-pressure water jets – that can drill a thousand holes into the nickel alloy of a combustor with speed and precision. Each of the more than 50 machines is set up with the correct drill heads and parts by mobile robots that travel up and down the hall on rails.

The human supervisors, meanwhile, use their cellphones to monitor a machine’s operational status, how much of the monthly production target has been achieved and the day’s electricity consumption. They can check real-time raw material prices, order new supplies once the current stock drops below a certain weight, or chat about the most recent race result of their colleague Ryota Kondo, one of Japan’s top marathon runners.

We will continue to invest in and expand our facilities to support the growth we expect MHIAEL to achieve. Our confidence in the future is based not only on the underlying market expansion I have already discussed, but also on the fact that the newer engine programs we are part of – such as the PW1100G-JM – are only now starting to generate spare parts and maintenance revenue. This is the most profitable element of such a program and since such programs can extend for 40 years, our MRO business is set for steady growth.

A third reason to be optimistic is that we have won larger work shares on the more recent engine programs and, based on our technological and service track record, we expect that trend to continue. As people continue to fly more and more, MHIAEL is set to take off alongside them.",https://spectra.mhi.com/sites/g/files/jwhtju2216/files/styles/crop_freeform/public/Masanori-Ushida.jpg?itok=uC0ZZ6uo,N,,2025-11-12 19:56:40.675092

China has set an ambitious vision for the future of its aviation industry, aiming to revolutionize air travel with the use of green hydrogen and eco-friendly aviation fuel by 2030. The country’s National Energy Administration (NEA) is focusing on utilizing renewable energy to fuel the production of these sustainable aviation fuels, aiming to transform the aerospace sector into a more eco-conscious and sustainable industry. With aviation’s growing role in carbon emissions globally, China’s strategy is a response to the need for more sustainable solutions in the industry, ensuring its leadership in eco-friendly technologies on the global stage.

The Role of Green Hydrogen in Aviation’s Future

One of the most significant components of the NEA’s five-year plan is the push for green hydrogen. Green hydrogen, produced using renewable electricity through the process of water electrolysis, is a promising alternative to traditional fossil fuels. By splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules, green hydrogen can serve as a low-carbon fuel, powering everything from heavy industries to transport vehicles, and even airplanes. This hydrogen can also be used in the production of green ammonia and green methanol, which are essential for fertilizers and shipping. For aviation, this could mean a sustainable fuel option that reduces the industry’s reliance on fossil fuels, contributing significantly to the sector’s carbon reduction goals. The scalability of green hydrogen production makes it a key candidate for meeting the aviation sector’s energy needs in a sustainable manner.

Offshore Wind Energy: Key to Fueling Sustainable Aviation

Offshore wind energy is expected to play a key role in China’s transition to green aviation. The NEA has recommended that coastal regions explore the potential of offshore wind to produce green hydrogen, an emerging technology with the potential to revolutionize both energy production and fuel supply for aviation. By harnessing the abundant wind resources along China’s coastline, the country aims to create a sustainable supply chain for green hydrogen and eco-friendly aviation fuel, thereby reducing the aviation sector’s carbon footprint. This initiative is expected to reduce the industry’s dependency on traditional fuels and significantly decrease carbon emissions, helping China meet its climate goals.

Addressing Energy Surplus with Eco-Friendly Aviation Fuel

As China’s renewable energy capacity grows, the issue of curtailment – where excess wind and solar energy cannot be absorbed by the grid – has become more pressing. To address this, the NEA is working to ensure that surplus energy is directed towards the production of green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel. By channeling excess energy into eco-friendly fuel production, China aims to create a more efficient energy system and contribute to the decarbonization of the aviation sector. With excess solar and wind power that often goes unused, China is looking to create a sustainable and efficient energy ecosystem by transforming this surplus into valuable resources for the aviation industry, reducing both waste and emissions.

China’s Position as a Leader in Sustainable Aviation

The NEA’s strategy aligns with global efforts to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint and increase the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs). By prioritizing green hydrogen and other eco-friendly fuels, China is positioning itself as a leader in the global push for more sustainable air travel. This vision reflects China’s broader decarbonization goals and sets a clear path for the future of aviation, not only within the country but across the globe. As other nations look to reduce aviation emissions, China’s plans serve as an example of how large-scale adoption of green hydrogen and SAFs can support the transition to a carbon-neutral aviation industry. By advancing these technologies, China aims to set the standard for a cleaner, greener aviation future.

The future of renewable energy could lie in a more efficient process that transforms corn into methanol.

Supported by Minnesota Corn, University of Minnesota Professor Paul Dauenhauer is leading a project that aims to make full use of corn’s glucose polymers through inorganic catalysis.

Currently, corn ethanol production yields about three gallons of fuel per bushel. However, traditional fermentation methods consume a third of the glucose in yeast metabolism, releasing CO2 as a byproduct.

Dauenhauer proposes using inorganic catalysts instead, allowing 100 percent conversion of corn glucose into methanol.

“Methanol has a universality to it,” Dauenhauer explained. “Using existing technology you can make methanol into jet fuel. You can also make clean burning diesel fuel, and you can make polyethylene polymers—plastics.”

His team is testing metal catalysts to find the most efficient and cost-effective method for large-scale production. The project aims to boost fuel yields by 50 percent while preserving essential corn coproducts like fiber and oil for livestock feed.

Methanol-based fuels could play a key role in reducing carbon emissions. Dauenhauer highlighted, “The benefit of using dimethyl ether in a diesel engine versus conventional diesel is it burns really cleanly.” The potential for corn-derived methanol to supply the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) market is also under study.

The research continues through 2028, focusing on process refinement and assessing the economics of converting ethanol plants into methanol facilities.

Minnesota Corn is funding other ethanol innovation projects, including efforts to run diesel engines on high-ethanol blends and turn ethanol with captured CO2 into sustainable jet fuel. These advances mark a major step toward a cleaner, more flexible bioenergy future.

EU and UK to begin carbon market link negotiations

A spokesperson for Denmark stated on Wednesday that EU countries have agreed to begin negotiations with the United Kingdom to link their carbon markets. Beginning January 1, the European Union will impose a carbon border fee on cement, steel, and other imports. The UK government has claimed that the new tariff will cost UK industries around 800 million pounds (over $1 billion) annually. The link is intended to reset relations between the EU and the UK following Brexit. While this link will allow countries on both sides to avoid carbon border tariffs, it is unlikely to go into effect before the EU’s January 1 start date.

China to expand renewable energy use, looking to sustainable aviation fuel and green hydrogen

China’s National Energy Administration (NEA) aims to use excess wind and solar output to explore new renewable energy projects. In the new five-year plan, China hopes to expand industrial bases for sustainable aviation fuel, green ammonia, green methanol, and green hydrogen. A document outlining the 2026-2030 plan highlights the use of renewable energy, such as offshore wind, to produce green hydrogen and other new energy sources. As industry accounts for around 60% of China’s electricity use, renewables are critical for decarbonization goals. Currently, solar and wind can sometimes generate more electricity than the grid can accept. In an effort to stop this phenomenon, known as curtailment, the government aims to channel this energy into alternative uses.

Under current fuel standards, neat-or unblended-SAF is mixed with traditional jet fuel before use in an engine. Blended SAF is a ""drop in"" fuel, meaning airlines do not need to make changes to existing aircraft engines or fueling infrastructure to use it. By 2030, FedEx aims to obtain 30% of its fuel supply from alternative sources, on a blended basis.

Deploying SAF is just one component of a broader FedEx aviation sustainability and fuel efficiency strategy. Though the emissions profiles of SAF and traditional jet fuel are similar when burned, the production of sustainable aviation fuel can result in up to 80% fewer lifecycle emissions compared with the extraction of conventional fuels.^ However, this technological reality means that reducing overall fuel consumption and increasing operational efficiency must go hand-in-hand with alternative fuel uptake in order to reach emissions goals as an industry.

Aircraft modernization and other fuel savings initiatives enabled FedEx to avoid the use of 140 million gallons of jet fuel in FY 2024, resulting in $400 million in savings for the company. In FY 2024, FedEx achieved its previous goal of a 30% reduction in aircraft emissions intensity from a 2005 baseline. Upping its ambition, FedEx has since expanded that goal to target a 40% reduction in aircraft emissions intensity by 2034.

Co-funded through the Non-CO2 Programme, part of the ATI Programme, the Quantifying Reduction in Thermal Contrails by Optimising SAF (QRITOS) project brings together Rolls-Royce, British Airways, Imperial College London and Heathrow.

The benefits of SAF for reducing end-to-end CO2 emissions from fuel are well understood, and SAF is expected to play a key role in aviation’s decarbonisation journey. However, in-flight measurements behind aircraft have also shown SAF’s potential to reduce the number of ice crystals in contrails and therefore the potential climate impact of these thin clouds of ice particles that can form behind aircraft.

The amount of SAF currently available is only a small proportion of aviation’s overall fuel requirements. It is typically mixed with conventional fossil fuel, resulting in wide-scale deployment at very low SAF blend ratios. However, SAF use is expected to increase in the UK with the introduction of the SAF mandate which came into force at the start of the year and will see 10% of SAF in the UK fuel in 2030 and 22% in 2040.

Constantly changing weather means different flights cause contrails at different times and locations, yet most of the potential climate impact comes from only a small proportion of flights. This creates an opportunity for smart SAF use targeting those flights expected to form persistent contrails. The QRITOS project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, at one of the world’s busiest airports. It will do this by combining data from British Airways flight trials, advanced modelling and satellite observations to monitor contrail formation following this targeted SAF usage.

The project aims to show that we can prioritise particular flights for SAF, focusing on where it can deliver the greatest environmental benefit and maximise the effectiveness of the current levels of supply.

The Non-CO2 Programme focuses on addressing challenges with reducing non-CO2 emissions from aircraft, as outlined in the ATI’s Non-CO2 Technologies Roadmap. The funding programme is delivered by the Aerospace Technology Institute, Department for Business and Trade (DBT) and Innovate UK, in partnership with the Department for Transport (DfT) and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).

Industry Minister Chris McDonald said: “This is government and business working together at its best, and I look forward to seeing how this Rolls-Royce project can help keep UK industry at the forefront of the race for sustainable aviation.

MEMPHIS, TN / ACCESS Newswire / November 12, 2025 / Last month, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) continued its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) procurement momentum, beginning to take delivery of blended SAF at two additional U.S. airports for the first time: Chicago-O'Hare Airport and Miami International Airport. The start of these fuel deliveries in October marked the company's second and third deployments of blended SAF at a major U.S. airport in six months. In May, FedEx announced its first major U.S. SAF deployment at Los Angeles International Airport.

""Each executed agreement signals to fuel producers that airlines are willing and eager collaborators to help to scale the SAF market,"" said Karen Blanks Ellis, chief sustainability officer and vice president of Environmental Affairs, FedEx. ""The aviation industry still faces a mismatch between available SAF supply and carrier demand, but we are encouraged by the early signs of increased SAF production globally this calendar year.""

Chicago-O'Hare International Airport

At O'Hare, FedEx will receive a blend to include a total of one million gallons of neat SAF at a minimum 30% blend from Air bp. With its first fuel delivery in October, FedEx became the first U.S. all-cargo airline to purchase and deploy SAF at Chicago-O'Hare International Airport.*

""Existing fuel infrastructure and enabling policy conditions at the state level made sourcing SAF at O'Hare a logical next step in our alternative fuel procurement strategy,"" Blanks Ellis added.

Miami International Airport

At Miami International Airport, FedEx has started to take delivery of around three million gallons of blended SAF at a 30% blend minimum from AEG.

""With FedEx flights from Miami heading all over Latin America and the Caribbean every day, we are proud to see our Miami hub leading the way in sustainable fuel adoption,"" said Luiz R. Vasconcelos, president, FedEx Latin America and the Caribbean. ""This milestone reinforces our commitment and demonstrates to our customers that sustainability is not just a corporate goal-it is a regional priority. From SAF deployment in Miami to the rollout of electric delivery vehicles in countries like Mexico, Colombia, Chile, and Brazil, we're embedding sustainable innovation across our operations and actively contributing to the corporation's global sustainability strategy.""

SAF: Part of a holistic aviation sustainability strategy

Under current fuel standards, neat-or unblended-SAF is mixed with traditional jet fuel before use in an engine. Blended SAF is a ""drop in"" fuel, meaning airlines do not need to make changes to existing aircraft engines or fueling infrastructure to use it. By 2030, FedEx aims to obtain 30% of its fuel supply from alternative sources, on a blended basis.

Deploying SAF is just one component of a broader FedEx aviation sustainability and fuel efficiency strategy. Though the emissions profiles of SAF and traditional jet fuel are similar when burned, the production of sustainable aviation fuel can result in up to 80% fewer lifecycle emissions compared with the extraction of conventional fuels.^ However, this technological reality means that reducing overall fuel consumption and increasing operational efficiency must go hand-in-hand with alternative fuel uptake in order to reach emissions goals as an industry.

Aircraft modernization and other fuel savings initiatives enabled FedEx to avoid the use of 140 million gallons of jet fuel in FY 2024, resulting in $400 million in savings for the company. In FY 2024, FedEx achieved its previous goal of a 30% reduction in aircraft emissions intensity from a 2005 baseline. Upping its ambition, FedEx has since expanded that goal to target a 40% reduction in aircraft emissions intensity by 2034.

But despite its potential, sustainable aviation fuel makes up less than 1% of global jet fuel use, mainly due to high production costs and limited supply.
A life cycle analysis found that jet fuel made from municipal waste could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80-90% compared with conventional jet fuel.
The study examined how municipal solid waste could be converted into sustainable aviation fuel under several scenarios.
Ultimately, sustainable aviation fuel currently makes up less than 1% of global jet fuel use, mainly because of its high production costs.","Aviation currently contributes about 2.5% of total global carbon emissions, and with air travel demand expected to double by 2040, cutting those emissions has become a pressing priority. One path forward is sustainable aviation fuel, a low-carbon alternative made from feedstocks such as used cooking oil and crops. But despite its potential, sustainable aviation fuel makes up less than 1% of global jet fuel use, mainly due to high production costs and limited supply.

A new study in Nature Sustainability points to a promising breakthrough: using municipal solid waste as a reliable, low-emission, cost-effective feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel.

Researchers from Tsinghua University and the Harvard-China Project on Energy, Economy, and Environment evaluated municipal solid waste-based jet fuel produced through industrial-scale gasification and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. A life cycle analysis found that jet fuel made from municipal waste could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80-90% compared with conventional jet fuel. The main technical hurdle lies in scaling up gasification systems for widespread use.

“Unlike road transport, which is quickly shifting toward electrification, there’s no silver-bullet solution for achieving carbon-neutral aviation,” said Jingran Zhang, the study’s first author and a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard-China Project who is supported by the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability at Harvard. “Turning everyday trash into jet fuel could be an innovative but major near-term step toward cleaner aviation. By converting municipal waste into low-carbon jet fuel that already works in today’s engines, we can start cutting emissions immediately, without waiting for future technology.”

Municipal solid waste as a feedstock

Municipal solid waste includes organic matter like food scraps and paper as well as plastics and metals. Traditionally, much of this waste has been landfilled or incinerated, which consumes land or can contribute to air pollution. As landfill space shrinks and waste generation rises, converting municipal solid waste into liquid fuels could conserve land, cut emissions, and produce cleaner energy to help cities move toward zero-waste goals.

The Harvard study explores the largely under-researched potential of municipal solid waste-based jet fuel using real-world data on Fischer-Tropsch gasification technology. The researchers analyzed key emission sources, calculated greenhouse gas impacts, and identified ways to boost efficiency. They found that while the process significantly lowers emissions, only about 33% of input carbon is converted into fuel due to gas composition mismatches. Efficiency could be improved by capturing carbon dioxide or adding green hydrogen, produced with renewable power, during processing.

Global implications

Many countries are ramping up efforts to make aviation more sustainable by adopting cleaner fuels. In the United States, the government aims to produce up to 35 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuels annually by 2050, supported by strong financial incentives. In the European Union, new regulations will require all departing flights to gradually increase their share of sustainable aviation fuels, catapulting from 2% in 2025 to 70% by 2050. On a global scale, the International Civil Aviation Organization’s CORSIA program requires operators to offset emissions growth, which they can do by buying eligible offsets or by using sustainable fuels.

The study examined how municipal solid waste could be converted into sustainable aviation fuel under several scenarios. In the most practical case, global municipal solid waste could yield around 50 million tons (62 billion liters) of jet fuel globally, cutting aviation’s greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 16%. If waste management and conversion systems are inefficient, the benefits drop substantially. However, if green hydrogen is integrated into the process, production could reach 80 million tons per year, which is enough to supply up to 28% of global jet fuel demand and reduce emissions by as much as 270 million tons of carbon dioxide annually.

In Europe, the projected output would already exceed the European Union’s jet fuel-blending targets while remaining compliant with sustainability standards. Economically, the study suggests that adopting municipal solid waste-based jet fuels could save airlines money under carbon pricing systems like CORSIA, particularly when government incentives and subsidies are factored in.

Ultimately, sustainable aviation fuel currently makes up less than 1% of global jet fuel use, mainly because of its high production costs. This underscores the urgent need for strong policy action and financial incentives to scale up supply.",https://seas.harvard.edu/themes/custom/seas/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-12 10:57:08.163913

The band rates for economy passengers are S$1, S$2.80, S$6.40 and S$10.40 (€0.66, €2.42, €5.53 and €8.99). The rates are not that punitive and there is good news for those flying in premium economy, as it will be rated the same as economy. Another bonus is that transit passengers are exempt.

However, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) says: “The SAF Levy for Premium Cabin (business and first class) is four times that for the Economy Cabin for the same geographical band,” so this increases the top rate to S$41.60, more than €35.

It could have been worse; as the authority originally estimated the basic levy for a Singapore-London flight at S$16, or €13.83. However, CAAS says: “The lower SAF Levy amounts reflect the lower prevailing cost of SAF compared to when the initial estimates were made.”

The SAF tax will also be levied on private jets. Flying from Singapore in your Gulfstream G-IV, for example, will cost you between S$100 (€86) and $1,040 (€899) depending on distance.

CAAS says all revenue will go directly towards the purchase of SAF and environmental measures. Its director-general, Han Kok Juan, adds the levy “provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub”.

He argues: “We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.”

Singapore has set a 1% SAF target for 2026, with a goal to raise this to 3 to 5% by 2030, so there is a risk the levy may increase in future.

Until now, countries have shied away from imposing green levies, while airlines like Lufthansa have made SAF contributions voluntary.

So, could other countries follow Singapore? Most are aware that anything that makes flying more expensive will not be well-received by voters.

This week, UK Transport Minister Heidi Alexander told a conference that demand for flying “was only going in one direction” and that the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill, due to become law next spring, would include safeguards so that “passengers see little-to-no change in the price of a ticket”.

However, Singapore, may have opened the door to making green levies acceptable, particularly if they are not too much of a burden on the average traveller – to begin with, at least.",https://www.businesstraveller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2175448985-1024x767.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 10:57:38.753748

This industry has come a long way in the past 50-plus years and has seen myriad new technologies and techniques. Some thrived, some survived and others fell away. Alongside DDGS, corn oil became ubiquitous while other promising coproducts and processes didn’t quite get off the ground. But ethanol producers’ appetite for growth has always been healthy.

Starting on page 12, we explore the evolution of dry fractionation. Once drawing the full industry’s attention, the technology hit roadblocks in economic feasibility, as producers faced high costs and low margins. Some of the more promising fractionation technologies, however, set the stage for, or even fully morphed into, new front-end diversification processes that could find a better fit in our modern biorefineries. Tech companies have adapted wet-mill technologies and explored hammer mill alternatives to achieve value-added systems offering flexibility and increased yield.

Diversification can also come without plant expansion. Chippewa Valley Ethanol Co., historically a standout in innovation and process improvements, continues to forge ahead with corn kernel fiber cellulosic ethanol, decarbonization and efficiency upgrades. Some technologies—such as gasification of corn stover to produce syngas blended with natural gas for energy production—have come and gone with evolving markets and energy prices, while others have proven beneficial longer term—such as low energy distillation. Find out more about CVEC’s diversification strategies, starting on page 18.

Technology experts are innovating beyond traditional coproducts such as corn oil and DDGS, forging new paths for advanced food protein, feed additives, new textiles, fibers, biopolymers and commercial-grade pigments and even cosmetics. It’s done through precision fermentation, with one featured modular technology designed to operate alongside an ethanol plant using leftover fermentation yeast to produce microbial proteins and food-grade yeasts. A handful of companies are in the space, partnering with research labs to bring their technologies to commercial scale. It’s a new twist on coproduct diversification and it starts on page 24.

Finally, this issue delivers updates on the green methanol production process launching in Luverne, Minnesota, at an ethanol plant idled since 2022. A collaboration among AgriEnergy Innovations, CapCO2 Solutions and Methylennium Energy, the project is full steam ahead, with promise in sustainable aviation fuel and maritime markets. It will use a water-based electrolyzer to produce hydrogen for combination with waste CO2 to generate green methanol. The project’s developers hope it will be a blueprint for the industry and for further expansion.

The deliveries, which started in October, build on FedEx's first major US SAF rollout at Los Angeles International Airport earlier in 2025, the company said Nov. 10.

The move underscores the company's broader push to integrate lower-carbon fuels across its aviation network as it targets sourcing 30% of its fuel from alternative sources by 2030.

At the same time, policy decisions in Washington can increase market access, spur demand and ensure fair competition. This new Market Intel series will examine six priority policy areas - trade, biofuels, whole milk in schools, interstate commerce, transparent input markets and prioritizing U.S.-grown produce - and how each can help strengthen the farm economy and rural communities.

In this article, the first of two exploring opportunities in biofuel markets, we examine permanent year-round E15 authorization. In the next installment, we will turn to the growing sustainable aviation fuel market, biodiesel, tax incentives that support biofuel production and the potential impact of small refinery exemptions on these evolving markets.

Few markets tie together energy security and farm profitability as closely as ethanol. For more than two decades, ethanol has provided a reliable outlet for U.S. corn, strengthened domestic fuel supplies and saved consumers money at the gas pump. Around the world, nations are turning to ethanol to bolster their own energy security, and global consumption has more than doubled since the early 2000s. This continued growth highlights the important role of American-made ethanol in meeting fuel demand.

Ethanol

Ethanol currently uses about 5.6 billion bushels of corn each year, roughly 33% of total U.S. corn production. The standard gasoline blend contains 10% ethanol (E10), and in 2025 the national average blend reached about 10.2%. Some states, including top ethanol producers like Iowa and Minnesota, utilize higher blends such as E15 (15% ethanol) and E85 (85% ethanol) in flexible-fuel vehicles. However, the reach of these blends is limited by regulatory restrictions, particularly the seasonal limitation on E15 sales during the summer months.

E15 Uncertainty Stalls Growth

Each summer, federal limits on fuel volatility restrict the sale of E15 in many parts of the country. The rule stems from the Clean Air Act. In 1978, the EPA waived the requirements for E10 but left E15 subject to tighter standards even though it performs just as cleanly. E15 can reduce harmful tailpipe emissions by roughly 46% compared to non-ethanol gasoline, ethanol burns cleaner and represents a step toward more sustainable fuel consumption. To provide temporary relief, the Environmental Protection Agency has used emergency authority to issue nationwide waivers allowing summer E15 sales. In April 2025, EPA approved such a waiver for the second consecutive year. However, emergency waivers must be reissued each year, creating uncertainty for fuel retailers and consumers. Without a permanent policy, retailers are less likely to invest in E15 infrastructure and marketing.

This uncertainty comes as ethanol demand overall faces broader headwinds. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that motor gasoline use will decline over the next decade, even under optimistic scenarios. National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) finds that if blend rates remain near a 10.5% average, domestic ethanol use could fall from about 14.2 billion gallons in 2025 to 13.1 billion gallons by 2035, roughly 400 million fewer bushels of corn used for ethanol. This reduction reflects the EIA’s forecast for lower U.S. motor gasoline consumption over the next decade, driven by more fuel-efficient vehicles, increased electric-vehicle adoption, and slower growth in overall driving miles.

Year-Round E15 Authorization Would Speed Up Demand

Nationwide, year-round E15 authorization presents the most straightforward path to preserve existing ethanol demand and create new growth. Even a modest increase in the national blend rate could have a measurable impact. According to NCGA, a 1% increase in the average ethanol blend rate would add 1.36 billion gallons of ethanol, equal to about 486 million bushels of corn. A 5% increase, to move from E10 to E15, would translate to 6.8 billion gallons of ethanol, or roughly 2.4 billion bushels of corn a year.",https://www.fb.org/imgz/Analysis/MarketIntel/MI-Graphics/_socialwFacebook/249676/MI_2025-E15.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 08:56:17.370264

The two-year project, known as Quantifying Reduction in Thermal Contrails by Optimising SAF (QRITOS), is co-funded through the Non-CO2 Programme under the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI).
It brings together Rolls-Royce, British Airways, Imperial College London, and Heathrow Airport to study how smarter deployment of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, could reduce the climate impact of contrails.
“At British Airways, we believe sustainable aviation fuel is central to the future of flying,” said Tom Byrne, the airline’s Head of Net Zero and Environment.
“This is government and business working together at its best, and I look forward to seeing how this Rolls-Royce project can help keep UK industry at the forefront of the race for sustainable aviation,” he said.","Rolls-Royce is leading a new UK research initiative aimed at finding more effective ways to use sustainable aviation fuel to reduce both carbon and non-carbon emissions, the company stated.

The two-year project, known as Quantifying Reduction in Thermal Contrails by Optimising SAF (QRITOS), is co-funded through the Non-CO2 Programme under the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI). It brings together Rolls-Royce, British Airways, Imperial College London, and Heathrow Airport to study how smarter deployment of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, could reduce the climate impact of contrails.

While SAF is already recognised for its potential to cut carbon emissions compared with fossil jet fuel, studies have shown that it can also reduce the number of ice crystals that form in aircraft contrails. According to Rolls-Royce, fewer and thinner contrails could lessen aviation’s wider climate impact.

Alan Newby, Director of Research and Technology at Rolls-Royce, said “SAF will not only play a vital role in decarbonising aviation, but has also been shown to reduce certain non-CO2 emissions. This project will demonstrate smarter ways of using SAF which could unlock additional value through reducing non-CO2 climate effects as well.”

Because contrails are only formed under specific weather conditions, most of the climate effect is caused by a relatively small number of flights. The QRITOS project aims to determine whether SAF can be prioritised for those flights most likely to produce persistent contrails, using flight trials, atmospheric modelling, and satellite data collected at Heathrow.

Marcin Dutka, Environmental Sustainability Technologist at Rolls-Royce and project manager for QRITOS, said “Measurements have already shown that fuel composition can influence contrail properties. This project aims to demonstrate how contrail climate impact might be reduced by targeting SAF at flights predicted to form persistent contrails.”

British Airways is contributing operational data from its fleet. “At British Airways, we believe sustainable aviation fuel is central to the future of flying,” said Tom Byrne, the airline’s Head of Net Zero and Environment. “Through the QRITOS project, we’re exploring how SAF can go beyond reducing carbon emissions to also help minimise the climate impact of contrails.”

Heathrow Airport is also participating. Matt Gorman, Director of Carbon Strategy, said “As SAF continues to scale it is important to take a closer look at how we can use it to deliver the greatest climate benefit. As one of the world’s busiest airports we’re proud to participate in this project to demonstrate how targeted SAF use could help to address non-CO2 emissions.”

The research team at Imperial College London will develop new computational models and satellite imaging tools to monitor contrail formation. Associate Professor Sebastian Eastham said “We will develop and trial advanced computational contrail modelling and satellite image analysis techniques, with the goal of performing both prediction and near real-time assessment of the effectiveness of targeted SAF deployment for contrail warming reduction.”

Industry Minister Chris McDonald described the project as an example of collaboration between government and business. “This is government and business working together at its best, and I look forward to seeing how this Rolls-Royce project can help keep UK industry at the forefront of the race for sustainable aviation,” he said.

According to the ATI, QRITOS will conclude in April 2027 and aims to improve forecasting methods, advance understanding of contrail formation, and develop new ways to verify environmental outcomes using satellite data.",https://ukdjassets-b4d.kxcdn.com/34bd6acbb37094e43de8c481b94ca2cc_/turbinerollsroyce1.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 07:56:13.097070

From SAF deployment in Miami to the rollout of electric delivery vehicles in countries like Mexico, Colombia, Chile, and Brazil, we’re embedding sustainable innovation across our operations and actively contributing to the corporation’s global sustainability strategy.”

Under current fuel standards, neat, or unblended, SAF is mixed with traditional jet fuel before use in an engine. Blended SAF is a “drop-in” fuel, meaning airlines do not need to make changes to existing aircraft engines or fueling infrastructure to use it. By 2030, FedEx aims to obtain 30% of its fuel supply from alternative sources, on a blended basis.

Deploying SAF is just one component of a broader FedEx aviation sustainability and fuel efficiency strategy. Though the emissions profiles of SAF and traditional jet fuel are similar when burned, the production of sustainable aviation fuel can result in up to 80% fewer lifecycle emissions compared with the extraction of conventional fuels. However, this technological reality means that reducing overall fuel consumption and increasing operational efficiency must go hand-in-hand with alternative fuel uptake in order to reach emissions goals as an industry.

Through aircraft modernisation and other fuel-saving initiatives, FedEx avoided 140 million gallons of jet fuel in FY 2024, saving the company $400 million. The airline also met its FY 2024 goal of cutting aircraft emissions intensity by 30% from a 2005 baseline and has now raised its target to a 40% reduction by 2034.",https://www.stattimes.com/h-upload/2025/11/12/88647-download-4-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 07:56:25.835284

This initiative, aimed at reducing the aviation sector’s carbon footprint, will add a modest surcharge to passengers’ flight tickets to fund the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). By doing so, Singapore is positioning itself as a global leader in eco-friendly aviation.

With the aviation industry being a major contributor to global emissions, this move is part of Singapore’s broader strategy to make air travel more sustainable. While the levy is small, it reflects the country’s commitment to creating a cleaner and more responsible aviation sector, inspiring other global hubs to follow suit.

How the Green Fuel Levy Works

The green fuel levy will be applied as a fixed charge on flight tickets, depending on the class of travel and flight distance. This levy will support the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—a renewable fuel made from sustainable sources like used cooking oil, algae, and waste biomass. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF can cut carbon emissions by up to 80% throughout its lifecycle, making it a vital part of the aviation industry’s path to decarbonization.

Here’s how the levy will break down:

Economy and Premium Economy Passengers: The levy will range from S$1 (around ₹68) for regional flights to S$10.40 (roughly ₹700) for long-haul flights to destinations like the Americas.

Business and First-Class Passengers: These travellers will contribute between S$4 (approximately ₹270) and S$41.60 (about ₹2,800), depending on the distance of their flight and the fuel consumption.

Cargo Flights: For cargo shipments, the levy will be based on weight, ranging from S$0.01 to S$0.15 per kilogram (roughly ₹0.68 to ₹10/kg).

While the levy is not a significant increase in travel costs, it plays a key role in financing the transition to a more sustainable aviation future.

Key Dates and What Travellers Need to Know

The green fuel levy will apply to all flights departing Singapore starting in October 2026, but it will be effective for tickets issued from April 1, 2026 onward. Passengers who book their tickets before April 2026 will not be charged the levy, even if their flight departs after the official start date.

Only passengers flying out of Singapore will be affected, while transit passengers passing through Changi Airport without departing will not incur the levy. The charge will appear as a distinct line item on passengers’ tickets, ensuring transparency and clarity.

Singapore’s Commitment to Sustainable Aviation

Singapore’s introduction of the green fuel levy is part of a broader strategy to ensure that the country plays a leading role in the sustainable aviation sector. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has set a target for sustainable aviation fuel to comprise 1% of total jet fuel consumption by 2026, with the goal to increase this to 3-5% by 2030.

This levy allows the government to ensure that the cost of adopting SAF is shared fairly by passengers rather than burdening airlines or taxpayers. By placing responsibility for funding sustainable fuel directly on those who benefit from aviation, Singapore is ensuring a model that is both financially sustainable and environmentally responsible.

What It Means for Passengers

For most passengers, the green fuel levy will not drastically affect their overall travel budgets. The levy is designed to be affordable, with charges ranging from ₹68 to ₹700 for economy passengers, depending on the flight length. For business and first-class passengers, the cost will be higher, reflecting the larger environmental impact of longer flights.

Though the levy is modest, it ensures that Singapore’s aviation industry remains a leader in sustainability. The charge will be clearly listed on tickets, making it easy for passengers to understand their contribution to cleaner skies.

A Global Example of Green Aviation

By introducing the green fuel levy, Singapore is setting a global standard for how the aviation industry can reduce its carbon emissions and move towards sustainable fuel alternatives. This levy represents a small but significant step in the country’s efforts to combat climate change while continuing to support the growth of global aviation.

As the first country to formally implement such a levy, Singapore is showing the world that aviation can be both economically viable and environmentally responsible. This initiative could serve as a model for other aviation hubs and governments looking to reduce the environmental impact of air travel.

A New Era for Eco-Friendly Aviation

The introduction of the green fuel levy is more than just an additional charge for travellers. It is a key element of Singapore’s broader strategy to shape the future of aviation. By incorporating sustainability directly into flight pricing, Singapore is pioneering a new model for the global aviation industry.

This move is an important step towards ensuring that future generations of travellers can continue to enjoy air travel while minimizing the environmental impact. With the introduction of the levy, Singapore is leading the way towards a cleaner, more sustainable future for aviation.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/freepik__the-style-is-candid-ima-2025-11-12T154127955.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 07:56:51.176306

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has introduced the green fuel levy to support the use of sustainable aviation fuel. This is a cleaner alternative made from low-carbon sources such as used cooking oil and waste biomass. Unlike traditional jet fuel, SAF can reduce emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle, though it's still far costlier to produce.

To help cover this gap, every passenger departing from Singapore will pay a small, fixed contribution that goes toward SAF purchases. The amount depends on the flight distance and travel class:

Economy/Premium Economy: Between S$1 (around Rs 68) for short regional routes and S$10.40 (around Rs 700) for long-haul flights to destinations like the Americas.

Business/First Class: Between S$4 (around Rs 270) and S$41.60 (around Rs 2,800) for longer, more fuel-intensive journeys.

Cargo Flights: Levies range from S$0.01 to S$0.15 per kilogram (around Rs 0.68-Rs 10/kg) depending on distance.

As one of Asia's busiest air hubs, Singapore plays a key role in shaping aviation's future sustainability. The levy supports the country's target for sustainable aviation fuel to make up 1% of total jet fuel use by 2026, with plans to increase this to 3-5% by 2030, depending on global supply and cost trends. Rather than burdening airlines or taxpayers, the government is spreading the cost fairly among air travellers who directly benefit from aviation. This ensures that Singapore's path to greener skies remains both financially viable and environmentally responsible.

The policy also offers predictability: airlines know how much to collect, passengers see the charge clearly, and the funds are dedicated solely to sustainable fuel procurement. It's a carefully designed model that other nations are likely to watch closely.

What The Green Fuel Levy Means for Travellers

For most passengers, the levy won't dramatically change travel budgets. However, it does reflect a meaningful shift in how the aviation industry is tackling its carbon challenge. Here's what travellers should keep in mind:

For economy travellers, the additional cost ranges from Rs 68 to about Rs 700, which is negligible compared to the total ticket prices. Business and first-class flyers will pay more, reflecting their larger share of flight emissions.

Tickets bought before 1 April 2026 won't include the levy, even for later travel dates.

The funds directly finance sustainable aviation fuel, helping make air travel more eco-friendly.

Singapore’s green fuel levy: A step forward but harder work awaits To make low-carbon fuels a lasting part of the energy mix, the country must now focus on building up the supply side Summary: Singapore’s new green fuel levy marks a pivotal step in decarbonising transport. From 2026, all flights departing Singapore must use at least 1% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), rising to 3–5% by 2030. The levy, managed by CAAS, will fund SAF procurement and help airlines manage higher costs—sending a strong demand-side signal for low-carbon transition. But lasting progress hinges on the supply side. To avoid long-term dependence on imported SAF, Singapore must support local and regional biofuel production, incentivise R&D and innovation, and attract private capital through de-risked financing. Emerging biofuel players face high capital costs, limited economies of scale, and price volatility, yet circular business models—turning waste into fuel and by-products into value—can strengthen both sustainability and profitability. Regionally, ASEAN’s biomass-rich landscape offers a huge opportunity. Singapore can play a convener role, harmonising standards and enabling a cross-border biofuels market—anchoring its position as a trusted hub for sustainable finance, technology, and trade.

Singapore will introduce a fixed levy on all departing flights from 2026 to fund the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel. The measure aims for greener fuel to make up 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in its first year. Former Temasek chief executive Ho Ching defended the move after criticism from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), saying it is reasonable for airlines and passengers to bear the cost of reducing emissions rather than taxpayers. She described the levy as a practical approach for a small country with limited capacity to produce its own green fuel, one that could help stabilise prices and encourage investment in new production.

This policy adjustment could also support rapeseed oil demand, potentially offsetting downward pressure from this year’s larger crop as the market relied more heavily on HVO production, the report said.
Sources indicated this could apply retroactively for two years, potentially disqualifying some small- to medium-sized suppliers from selling to Germany and creating a premium in the German market.
The German policy change came as UCO markets faced additional pressure from increasing Chinese sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, a 24 October Vesper report said.
The removal of double-counting advantages will fundamentally alter the economics of UCOME production versus HVO processing,” Vesper wrote.","The German government had reached an informal agreement to end double-counting for advanced biofuels, including used cooking oil methyl ester (UCOME), towards greenhouse gas (GHG) quotas, the 6 November report quoted industry sources as saying.

According to an internal memo from industry association VDB, the energy ministry expects a legal amendment to take effect on 1 January 2026, coinciding with the European Union (EU)’s RED III legislation implementation into German law.

The proposed change would have significant implications for used cooking oil methyl ester (UCOME), which could become substantially less relevant in Germany’s biodiesel market, the report said.

Market sources had indicated this shift would likely increase demand for hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), Vesper wrote.

This policy adjustment could also support rapeseed oil demand, potentially offsetting downward pressure from this year’s larger crop as the market relied more heavily on HVO production, the report said.

Germany was also addressing supply chain concerns and the environment ministry had reached an agreement on “protection of trust” provisions, which would allow authorities to cancel certificates generated through fraudulent activity, including false declarations of biofuel imports, Vesper wrote.

Sources indicated this could apply retroactively for two years, potentially disqualifying some small- to medium-sized suppliers from selling to Germany and creating a premium in the German market.

“This possibly means that if this law is introduced, large buyers such as Shell will include clauses in their contracts transferring liability to suppliers for any potential fraud,” one market player was quoted as saying.

The Netherlands is pursuing similar reforms, according to the report.

The Dutch Emissions Authority had confirmed that UCOME would be treated as a fossil fuel if supplied to the maritime sector under the country’s upcoming RED legislation, the report said.

While UCOME would remain eligible for compliance in road transport and inland waterways sectors, bunkering demand for UCOME was expected to decline.

The German policy change came as UCO markets faced additional pressure from increasing Chinese sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, a 24 October Vesper report said.

China had approved three additional biofuel refiners for SAF exports, issuing quotas totalling 788,000-828,000 tonnes/year to Shandong Haike Chemical, Shandong Sanju Bioenergy and Bain Capital-backed EcoCeres, Vesper wrote.

According to a Reuters report, China has increased projected SAF exports to 1.2M tonnes this year, leading to increased competition for UCO feedstock.

European biodiesel producers now faced a strategic decision point, with the elimination of double-counting in Germany removing a significant economic incentive for UCOME production, while growing Asian demand for UCO feedstock had created additional supply constraints, the report said.

“For UCOME producers and biodiesel buyers, the next two months present a critical window to reassess supply strategies before the anticipated German policy implementation.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said the charge will range from SGD1 to SGD41.60 per passenger, depending on destination and travel class.

The levy will apply to tickets sold from 1 April 2026, for flights departing from 1 October that year. The additional fee will appear as a separate line on air tickets, and travellers on longer routes or in higher cabin classes will pay more.

Levy Rates By Destination And Cabin Class

CAAS has divided destinations into four geographical bands. Passengers travelling within Southeast Asia will pay the lowest amount, while those heading to the Americas will pay the highest.

Levy for passengers (SGD)

CAAS said travellers to Bangkok will pay SGD1 (about RM3.20) in economy or SGD4 in business class, while those heading to Tokyo will pay SGD2.80 and SGD11.20 respectively. Flights to London will see levies of SGD6.40 and SGD25.60 , while trips to New York will cost SGD10.40 and SGD41.60 .

These rates are lower than estimates made in 2024, when economy passengers were expected to pay up to SGD16 for long-haul flights. CAAS said prices of SAF have since moderated, allowing for a smaller surcharge.

When the Levy Will Take Effect

The rollout will give airlines and travellers time to prepare. The levy will not apply to passengers transiting through Singapore, nor to training, humanitarian, or charitable flights.

Tickets issued before April 2026 will not include the levy, even if travel occurs after October that year. The rates will remain fixed “for a few years” as Singapore targets having 1% of all jet fuel at Changi and Seletar airports derived from sustainable sources.

By 2030, that share is expected to rise to between 3% and 5%, depending on fuel availability and market conditions.

Existing Passenger Fees at Changi

The new SAF levy will be added on top of Singapore’s existing departure charges, which are already scheduled to rise over the next few years.

Existing departing passenger fees (SGD)

This means that by 2026, an economy passenger flying from Singapore to New York will pay a total of SGD75.60 in fees, while a business or first-class passenger will pay SGD106.80.

CAAS said these increases are needed to fund airport expansion projects and to offset rising operational costs such as energy and labour.

Implications For Malaysian Travellers

For Malaysians who often travel through Singapore, especially on long-haul routes, the new levy could mean slightly higher airfares. Many passengers from Johor and Kuala Lumpur use Changi Airport for international flights, particularly to destinations in Europe and North America that may not have direct connections from Malaysian airports.

For example, a traveller flying from Johor Bahru to Changi and onwards to London in economy class would face an additional SGD6.40 levy on top of Singapore’s standard fees. Business-class passengers on the same route would pay SGD25.60 more.

Although the levy itself is modest, it may make Singapore flights marginally more expensive compared with similar routes departing from Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA). Airlines operating connecting flights between Malaysia and Singapore could also adjust their ticket pricing to reflect the higher overall cost.

According to regional aviation analysts, Malaysia may eventually consider adopting comparable measures, as countries face increasing pressure to align with global carbon-reduction targets under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

""This is in lockstep with Petronas’ larger aspiration to become an integrated energy leader in the next decade, serving the world’s energy needs, safely, reliably and sustainably"".

Euglena founder and president Mitsuru Izumo said, ""This project represents a global endeavor and a powerful step toward decarbonization and a more sustainable future, through enhanced clean energy supply capacity, particularly across the ASEAN region and beyond"".

""In our continued efforts to expand decarbonization solutions in response to climate change, we will continue to invest in research and development of microalgae, and advance our efforts toward the commercialization of algal biofuel"", Izumo added.

Stefano Ballista , chief executive of Eni biofuels arm Enilive, said, ""With Enilive’s biorefineries that are already operational in Italy and in the United States of America, and with new plants under construction in Italy and South Korea, the new biorefinery in Pengerang is a further and relevant step forward towards the achievement of a production capacity over five million tons per year and over two million tons of SAF by 2030, supporting the growing need for more sustainable mobility"".

Italy's state-backed energy major Eni has set goals to grow its biorefining capacity to over three MMtpa by 2028 and more than five MMtpa by 2030, with the potential to produce up to two MMtpa of SAF by 2030.

Eni's current biofuels production come from two Italian plants in Venice and Gela and a United States plant in Louisiana, operated under its 50 percent-owned joint venture St Bernard Renewables LLC, according to the company.

Earlier this year Eni began construction for a biorefinery project with LG Chem at the latter's Daesan Chemical Complex in South Korea.

Targeted for completion 2027, the plant will have an annual bio-feedstock processing capacity of about 400,000 metric tons and produce HVO and SAF, Eni said August 4.

Eni said last month it had launched the authorization process for an Environmental Impact Assessment to build another biorefinery and a chemical recycling plant in Sicily, after receiving approval from Italy's Environment and Energy Security Ministry.

Designed to produce up to 500,000 metric tons per annum of HVO diesel and SAF, the Priolo project will rise on the site of an Eni ethylene plant set to be decommissioned, Eni said in a press release October 9.

Eni said it will be its second biorefinery in Sicily, after the Gela plant, which began biofuel production 2019 after being transformed from a petrochemical site.

The Priolo biorefinery will be fed mainly by vegetable waste and oils and animal fats, Eni said.

On September 23 Eni said it had received approval from the ministry to convert several units at the Sannazzaro de' Burgondi refinery in Pavia into a biorefinery.

The refinery will continue traditional operations alongside a new processing capacity of 550,000 metric tons a year for biofuel feedstock, mainly waste and residues. Expected to start operations 2028, the biorefinery will have the flexibility to produce SAF and HVO diesel.

""The new Sannazzaro biorefinery will strengthen the site's strategic role in supplying traditional jet fuel and SAF to north-west Italian airports, via both the pipeline connection to Milan Malpensa airport and depots connected to the refinery near other airports"", Eni said.

""Through Enilive, Eni is already the second-largest producer of HVO biofuels in Europe, including both diesel and biojet (SAF)"", the company said.

Microsoft believes AI’s capacity to measure, predict and optimise complex systems will be fundamental in developing and scaling climate solutions.

Since 2020, Microsoft’s Climate Innovation Fund has directed over US$800m of a pledged US$1bn into a portfolio of 67 companies.

While the fund’s scope is broad, its investment direction shows an increasing focus on AI-driven strategies.

Examples include an investment in Vibrant Planet, which uses AI-powered geospatial analytics to help mitigate wildfire risk.

Another is Terradot, a start-up applying AI to enhanced rock weathering, which is a method for carbon removal.

Melanie Nakagawa, Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) at Microsoft, sees AI as essential for progress despite the energy demands of the technology itself.

“The force creating this distance from our goals in the short term is the same one that will help us build a bigger, faster and more powerful rocket to reach them in the long term: artificial intelligence,” Melanie explains. “This is not hyperbole.”

AI’s role in hard-to-abate sectors

The fund directs capital towards sectors where decarbonisation is a major challenge, including steel and aviation.

Microsoft invested in Stegra’s commercial-scale facility in Sweden, which uses green hydrogen to produce steel with up to 95% fewer emissions than traditional methods.

Microsoft paired this with purchase agreements for steel to be used in its data centre equipment.

In aviation, Microsoft is backing the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The fund has supported Twelve’s carbon transformation technology and LanzaJet’s alcohol-to-jet process.

Microsoft also participated in a book-and-claim accounting model with Alaska Airlines, enabling the reporting of emissions reductions from SAF without requiring its physical delivery for specific flights.

These initiatives create complex systems and supply chains where AI could be used for future optimisation and efficiency gains.

“Through the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, we invest in ambitious ideas and scalable technologies that create real impact,” says Brad Smith, Vice Chair (VC) and President of Microsoft.

Financing and scaling new climate models

A portion of the fund is dedicated to catalysing new markets and financing models. According to Microsoft, a financing gap often exists for nascent climate technologies, which can be too large for venture capital but too risky for traditional infrastructure investors.

Microsoft estimates this gap is between US$100m and US$180m per project.

To address this, the fund has committed more than US$100m to “first-of-a-kind” projects. It provided project finance for the Climeworks Orca plant, the first commercial direct air capture facility and supported this with a 10-year offtake agreement for 10,000 tons of CO₂.

In Nigeria, the fund backed Konexa’s development of renewable energy infrastructure for Heineken’s operations, aiming to create a replicable model for the country's power sector.

This strategy, which combines corporate investment with procurement and technology support, has attracted US$12bn in follow-on capital across the fund's portfolio companies, according to a report from Microsoft.

Measuring impact with data

To evaluate the success of its investments, Microsoft has worked with Rhodium Group to develop a framework that assesses both direct emissions reductions and the “catalysed” reductions that occur when new technologies are helped towards cost parity.

For emerging technologies like low-carbon steel, the fund reports that catalysed reductions could substantially exceed direct reductions.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/a4df115508ce0c79a6f289138b9ba1ba:f447dc23fa486680c2ac4afd1a22b1ef/brad-smith.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 07:57:57.075900

Aviation alone produced 882Mt of CO₂ in 2023, according to the Air Transport Action Group.

In response, the Commission has adopted its communication on a Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP).

This establishes a roadmap to accelerate the energy transition in these critical industries, forming a key part of the EU Competitiveness Compass.

Fuelling the future of transport

The plan is designed to unlock capital and increase the production of renewable and low carbon fuels.

Its targets are aligned with the EU’s ReFuelEU aviation and FuelEU maritime regulations that are central to the energy strategy for transport.

The ReFuelEU aviation regulation promotes a greater uptake of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

This could include synthetic aviation fuels, advanced biofuels and recycled carbon aviation fuels to lower CO₂ emissions from air travel.

The FuelEU maritime regulation imposes limits on the yearly average greenhouse gas intensity of energy used by ships more than 5,000 gross tonnes calling at European ports.

To tackle air pollution, it also mandates that from 1st January 2030, passenger and container ships must use onshore power supply or other zero-emission technologies when docked.

Meeting the ambitious targets set by ReFuelEU and FuelEU will require an estimated 20 million tonnes of SAF and investments totalling €100bn (US$115.6bn) by 2035 to facilitate this energy transition.

Unlocking investment for new energy

Providing regulatory certainty is fundamental to attracting the necessary investment.

Through the STIP, the European Commission is signalling to the market that its targets are firm and that it will support the sector throughout this transition.

The plan's EU measures are expected to mobilise at least US$3.1bn by the end of 2027.

This includes several key funding streams:

InvestEU to mobilise at least US$2.1bn for sustainable alternative fuels by 2027

About US$320m via the European Hydrogen Bank to support hydrogen production for SAF and sustainable maritime fuel (SMF) by year-end

Around US$142m for research and innovation projects under Horizon Europe

A projected US$164m for synthetic aviation fuel projects and US$314m for maritime fuel projects through the Innovation Fund

In the medium term, the EU plans to establish an intermediary mechanism to connect fuel producers and buyers.

This will provide revenue certainty and de-risk investment in new energy production.

Singapore is set to impose a new charge for travelers flying out of the country, starting in 2026. The “sustainable aviation fuel levy” (SAFL) will be levied on passengers departing Singapore from 1 October 2026, with tickets for these flights being sold from 1 April 2026. This new charge will apply to all international flights departing from Singapore Changi Airport and Seletar Airport, marking a significant step towards making aviation more environmentally friendly.

The levy is part of Singapore’s broader efforts to contribute to global sustainability goals by promoting the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The country has long been a leader in aviation innovation, and this initiative seeks to make air travel cleaner by reducing the industry’s carbon footprint.

What Is the Green Fuel Levy and How Will It Affect Passengers?

The green fuel levy, which will be added to the cost of flight tickets, aims to support the aviation industry’s transition to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). SAF is a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel and is made from renewable sources such as waste products, algae, and plant oils. The goal of the levy is to ensure that more airlines adopt SAF, thereby reducing the carbon emissions produced by air travel.

The new levy will vary depending on the destination and the class of travel. For example, passengers flying to nearby Southeast Asian destinations will pay as little as SGD 1 (approximately USD 0.75) per ticket. In contrast, those traveling to long-haul destinations such as North America will be charged up to SGD 41.60 (approximately USD 30) per ticket. Business and first-class passengers will face higher charges compared to economy passengers, reflecting the larger carbon footprint associated with premium classes.

While the levy is not excessively high, it will contribute to the broader goal of decarbonizing the aviation sector. The funds raised from the levy will be used to accelerate the adoption of SAF in Singapore and fund the development of sustainable aviation technologies. This marks a major step towards aligning the aviation sector with the Singapore government’s sustainability goals.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: A Necessary Step for Greener Aviation

The aviation industry is one of the largest contributors to global carbon emissions. As countries around the world work to meet their climate targets, reducing emissions from aviation has become a critical priority. SAF is considered one of the most promising solutions to help reduce the sector’s carbon footprint. SAF has the potential to lower life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

However, SAF is still in its early stages of development, and its production is currently limited. The green fuel levy will help make SAF more financially viable and encourage airlines to adopt this eco-friendly fuel. Singapore’s government has already committed to making its air hub a leader in the global push for greener aviation. As part of this vision, the country aims to meet its goal of achieving net-zero emissions in the aviation sector by 2050.

This levy will also put pressure on other countries to follow suit and consider similar charges or incentives to encourage the use of SAF. As more nations implement policies that encourage the adoption of sustainable aviation fuels, the global aviation industry will move closer to its decarbonization goals.

What Travelers Need to Know About the Levy

For travelers, the introduction of the green fuel levy means that the cost of flying out of Singapore will increase, but by a relatively small amount. The levy will be clearly itemized on the flight ticket, ensuring that passengers are aware of the charge before they book their tickets.

Passengers flying to nearby destinations in Southeast Asia will only see a small increase in their ticket prices, while those traveling to further destinations like the Americas and Europe will pay a larger charge. The levy will apply to both direct flights and connecting flights that depart from Singapore. However, passengers who are merely transiting through Singapore will not be required to pay the levy.

For airlines, this levy will encourage them to make the transition to SAF. The funds generated from the levy will be used to develop more sustainable aviation technologies and make SAF more affordable and accessible. The government has committed to working closely with airlines, fuel producers, and other stakeholders to ensure a smooth transition to sustainable aviation fuel.

A Step Towards Sustainable Travel

This move by Singapore represents a significant step towards achieving global sustainability in the aviation sector. The sustainable aviation fuel levy will not only help reduce the carbon footprint of air travel but will also encourage innovation in green technologies. It reflects Singapore’s commitment to becoming a leader in sustainable aviation, and the introduction of this levy will likely inspire other countries to consider similar measures.

While the levy may add a small cost to flight tickets, it will play an important role in creating a more sustainable future for aviation. The funds generated will help accelerate the development of SAF and other green technologies, which are essential for the future of air travel.

As the world moves towards a greener future, the introduction of the green fuel levy in Singapore is an important step that demonstrates the country’s leadership in sustainable travel. Travelers can expect a small increase in their ticket prices starting in 2026, but they can also feel good knowing that their contribution is helping the aviation industry move towards a more sustainable future.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/s2-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 07:58:17.571953

In a step towards sustainability, Singapore will introduce a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) levy from 1 April 2026, with the charges applying to flights departing from 1 October 2026. The levy aims to accelerate the adoption of greener jet fuel and reduce aviation emissions, marking a significant move towards the nation’s decarbonisation goals.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) shared in a press statement on 10 November that as longer flights consume more fuel, the SAF levy will be based on the distance travelled. All destinations from Singapore have been grouped into four geographical bands. For flights with multiple stops, the SAF levy applicable is based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore.

Here is the breakdown of the SAF levy geographical bands:

Geographical bandRegions & countries ISoutheast AsiaIINortheast Asia, South Asia, Australia, Papua New GuineaIIIAfrica, Central and West Asia, Europe, Middle East, Pacific Islands, New ZealandIVAmericas

SAF levy for passengers

The SAF levy will apply on a per-passenger basis, with charges varying by geographic zones, travel distance, and cabin type:

Economy Cabin which includes Economy Class and Premium Economy Class, or

Premium Cabin which includes Business Class and First Class.

Premium Cabin passengers will pay significantly more under the SAF levy — about four times the Economy Cabin within the same travel band, which CAAS said reflects industry standards that account for the higher carbon footprint of premium seating. Airlines will collect the SAF levy and must display it as a as a distinct line item on the air ticket sold.

The SAF levy will only apply to 'Origin-destination passengers' — a passenger who departs from Singapore to another destination — and not those transiting through Singapore.

Geographical bandPassenger SAF levy (per passenger charge)Band I

Economy cabin: S$1.00

Premium cabin: S$4.00Band II Economy cabin: S$2.80

Premium cabin: S$11.20Band III Economy cabin: S$6.40

Premium cabin: S$25.60Band IVEconomy cabin: S$10.40

Premium cabin: S$41.60

CAAS had initially estimated the SAF levy for economy passengers to be around S$3, S$6, and S$16 to Bangkok, Tokyo, and London, respectively. The actual charges, however, are much lower — S$1, S$2.80, and S$6.40 respectively. The difference reflects the current lower cost of sustainable aviation fuel compared to when the original estimates were made.

SAF levy for cargo shipments

For cargo shipments, the SAF levy will be charged per kilogramme and will vary by distance, grouped into four geographical bands.

Certain flights — such as training flights or those for charitable and humanitarian purposes — will be exempt from the SAF levy.

All collected levies will go into a statutory SAF Fund managed by CAAS, dedicated solely to purchasing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and/or SAF environmental attributes (EAs), as well as covering related administrative costs.

To ensure transparency and value for money, the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo) will oversee the procurement, allocation, and administration of SAF and EAs.

Commenting on the move, Han Kok Juan, Director-General, CAAS said:

""The introduction of the SAF levy marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub.""

From a particular date in 2026, passengers flying out of Changi Airport will see a small additional charge on their tickets: a ""green fuel levy"" aimed at funding the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The move makes Singapore one of the first countries in the world to formally integrate environmental accountability into flight pricing. While the added cost per ticket is modest, the initiative marks a major milestone in how global aviation hubs approach climate responsibility. For travellers, this new charge represents a glimpse into the future of sustainable flying, where cleaner skies may come with slightly higher fares.

Understanding The Green Fuel Levy: What It Is and How Much It Costs

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has introduced the green fuel levy to support the use of sustainable aviation fuel. This is a cleaner alternative made from low-carbon sources such as used cooking oil and waste biomass. Unlike traditional jet fuel, SAF can reduce emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle, though it's still far costlier to produce.

To help cover this gap, every passenger departing from Singapore will pay a small, fixed contribution that goes toward SAF purchases. The amount depends on the flight distance and travel class:

Economy/Premium Economy: Between S$1 (around Rs 68) for short regional routes and S$10.40 (around Rs 700) for long-haul flights to destinations like the Americas.

Business/First Class: Between S$4 (around Rs 270) and S$41.60 (around Rs 2,800) for longer, more fuel-intensive journeys.

Cargo Flights: Levies range from S$0.01 to S$0.15 per kilogram (around Rs 0.68-Rs 10/kg) depending on distance.

When It Kicks In: Key Dates and Who It Applies To

The levy officially begins in October 2026, but it applies only to tickets issued from 1 April 2026 onward. Travellers who book their tickets before April 2026 will not be charged the levy, even if their flight departs after implementation. The levy applies only to flights departing from Singapore. Transit passengers merely passing through Changi Airport will not have to pay for it. The fee will appear as a separate line item on air tickets for full transparency.

As one of Asia's busiest air hubs, Singapore plays a key role in shaping aviation's future sustainability. The levy supports the country's target for sustainable aviation fuel to make up 1% of total jet fuel use by 2026, with plans to increase this to 3-5% by 2030, depending on global supply and cost trends. Rather than burdening airlines or taxpayers, the government is spreading the cost fairly among air travellers who directly benefit from aviation. This ensures that Singapore's path to greener skies remains both financially viable and environmentally responsible.

The policy also offers predictability: airlines know how much to collect, passengers see the charge clearly, and the funds are dedicated solely to sustainable fuel procurement. It's a carefully designed model that other nations are likely to watch closely.

What The Green Fuel Levy Means for Travellers

For most passengers, the levy won't dramatically change travel budgets. However, it does reflect a meaningful shift in how the aviation industry is tackling its carbon challenge. Here's what travellers should keep in mind:

For economy travellers, the additional cost ranges from Rs 68 to about Rs 700, which is negligible compared to the total ticket prices. Business and first-class flyers will pay more, reflecting their larger share of flight emissions.

Tickets bought before 1 April 2026 won't include the levy, even for later travel dates.

The funds directly finance sustainable aviation fuel, helping make air travel more eco-friendly.

By asking travellers to share in the cost of cleaner skies, Singapore is setting a global benchmark for responsible aviation.","https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-11/pnq0uvrk_changi-airport_625x300_12_November_25.jpg?im=FaceCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738",N,,2025-11-12 07:58:26.190481

Opening Summary

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions needed by aviation to reach net-zero by 2050. This statistic isn’t just a number—it’s a mandate for transformation that I see reshaping the entire aviation ecosystem. In my work with global energy and transportation leaders, I’ve witnessed the quiet revolution happening behind the scenes. We’re at a pivotal moment where the aviation industry, responsible for 2-3% of global CO2 emissions according to the World Economic Forum, is fundamentally reinventing its energy foundation. The current state reminds me of the early days of renewable energy in other sectors—limited production capacity, high costs, but undeniable momentum building toward an inevitable tipping point. What we’re seeing now is just the beginning of a complete overhaul of how we power flight.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The Production Scale-Up Dilemma

The most immediate challenge I observe in my consulting work with aviation leaders is the massive gap between current SAF production and what’s needed to meet climate targets. As noted by McKinsey & Company, current SAF production accounts for less than 0.1% of total aviation fuel consumption, despite growing demand from airlines and corporate travelers. The reality is that scaling production isn’t just about building more facilities—it’s about creating entirely new supply chains, securing consistent feedstock, and navigating complex regulatory environments across different regions. I’ve sat in boardrooms where executives grapple with the chicken-and-egg problem: without guaranteed demand, investors hesitate to fund large-scale production facilities, but without sufficient supply, airlines can’t commit to meaningful SAF adoption. This creates a systemic bottleneck that requires coordinated action across multiple stakeholders.

Challenge 2: The Cost Competitiveness Conundrum

The economic reality of SAF presents another significant barrier. According to Deloitte research, sustainable aviation fuel currently costs two to four times more than conventional jet fuel, creating a substantial financial hurdle for widespread adoption. In my experience advising airline executives, this cost differential creates a competitive disadvantage for early adopters unless mechanisms are in place to share the burden across the value chain. The Harvard Business Review notes that while corporate sustainability commitments are driving some demand, the premium price of SAF makes it challenging for airlines to absorb these costs without passing them to consumers. What I see happening is a delicate balancing act between environmental responsibility and economic viability—a tension that requires innovative business models and policy support to resolve.

Challenge 3: Technological and Infrastructure Limitations

The third challenge revolves around technological maturity and infrastructure compatibility. As PwC highlights in their energy transition reports, most current SAF production relies on limited feedstock options and conversion technologies that haven’t yet achieved commercial scale. From my perspective as a technology futurist, the infrastructure challenge extends beyond production to distribution and storage. Existing airport fuel systems weren’t designed for widespread SAF integration, and the “drop-in” nature of current SAF formulations—while beneficial for compatibility—limits innovation in next-generation fuel technologies. I’ve seen how this creates a conservative approach to innovation, where the safe bet of incremental improvement often outweighs the potential rewards of breakthrough technologies.

Solutions and Innovations

The good news is that innovative solutions are emerging to address these challenges. Leading organizations are implementing several key strategies that I believe will accelerate SAF adoption.

First, strategic partnerships are becoming crucial. I’ve advised companies on forming consortiums that bring together airlines, fuel producers, technology providers, and corporate customers to share risks and rewards. These partnerships, like the one between Microsoft and Alaska Airlines that I’ve studied, create guaranteed demand that enables production scale-up while distributing costs across multiple stakeholders.

Second, technological innovation is rapidly advancing. Companies like LanzaJet are commercializing alcohol-to-jet technology, while others are exploring power-to-liquid pathways that use renewable electricity, water, and CO2 to create synthetic fuels. In my analysis, these second and third-generation technologies will dramatically expand feedstock options and reduce land-use concerns.

Third, policy mechanisms and carbon markets are creating new economic models. As the World Economic Forum reports, blending mandates in regions like Europe and tax incentives in the United States are helping bridge the cost gap while carbon offset programs are generating additional revenue streams for SAF producers.

Fourth, digital platforms are emerging to track, verify, and trade SAF certificates and environmental attributes. I’ve consulted with companies developing blockchain-based systems that provide transparent accounting of emissions reductions—a critical element for corporate sustainability reporting and regulatory compliance.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Looking ahead, the data paints a picture of rapid transformation. According to BloombergNEF projections, SAF production capacity could grow from less than 0.5 billion liters today to over 30 billion liters by 2030 under optimistic scenarios. The International Energy Agency forecasts that SAF could account for 10% of aviation fuel demand by 2030 in their accelerated case scenario, representing a hundred-fold increase from current levels.

In my foresight exercises with industry leaders, I envision several breakthrough moments in the coming decade. By 2026, I predict we’ll see the first commercial-scale power-to-liquid SAF facility become operational, demonstrating the potential for carbon-neutral aviation fuel. By 2028, I anticipate that SAF will reach cost parity with conventional jet fuel in certain regions due to scaling effects, technological improvements, and carbon pricing mechanisms.

The market size projections are equally compelling. Accenture analysis suggests the global SAF market could grow from approximately $500 million today to over $15 billion by 2030, creating massive opportunities for innovators across the value chain. What excites me most is how this transformation will ripple through adjacent industries, creating new markets for agricultural waste, municipal solid waste, and direct air capture technologies.

By 2030, I believe we’ll see regional SAF hubs emerge around major airport clusters, supported by dedicated renewable energy infrastructure and circular economy partnerships. The aviation fuel ecosystem of 2030 will look fundamentally different from today’s linear model, incorporating diverse feedstocks, multiple production pathways, and digital tracking systems that provide unprecedented transparency.

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

Over the next decade, sustainable aviation fuel will evolve from a niche product to a mainstream energy source that fundamentally reshapes aviation’s environmental footprint. The transformation will be driven by converging forces: regulatory pressure, technological innovation, corporate sustainability commitments, and growing consumer awareness. Airlines that successfully navigate this transition will gain competitive advantages through lower emissions profiles, strengthened brand reputation, and preferential access to increasingly scarce sustainable fuel supplies. The risks of delay are substantial—including regulatory non-compliance, stranded assets in conventional fuel infrastructure, and loss of market share to more agile competitors. The opportunity lies in building resilient, diversified fuel strategies that incorporate multiple SAF pathways and create value beyond mere compliance.

Ian Khan’s Closing

The future of flight is being rewritten today, not in distant laboratories but in boardrooms, policy forums, and innovation hubs around the world. What we’re witnessing is more than an energy transition—it’s the reinvention of one of humanity’s greatest achievements. As I often tell leaders in my keynotes: “The most sustainable fuel isn’t just what powers the aircraft, but the innovative thinking that powers the transformation.”

Opening Summary

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), sustainable aviation fuel production reached over 600 million liters in 2023—a 200% increase from 2022, yet still representing less than 0.2% of total aviation fuel consumption. This statistic reveals both the explosive growth and the monumental challenge ahead. In my work advising global aviation leaders, I’ve witnessed an industry at a critical inflection point. We’re no longer debating whether SAF will transform aviation—we’re grappling with how quickly and completely this transformation will occur. The World Economic Forum notes that aviation accounts for approximately 2-3% of global carbon emissions, making SAF adoption not just an environmental imperative but an economic necessity. What fascinates me most is how we’re approaching a threshold where technological innovation, policy alignment, and market forces converge to create unprecedented acceleration. Having consulted with airlines, fuel producers, and government agencies across three continents, I see patterns emerging that suggest we’re on the verge of a breakthrough moment that will redefine air travel as we know it.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The Feedstock Scarcity Paradox

The most immediate bottleneck I’m observing across the industry isn’t technology or funding—it’s the fundamental limitation of sustainable feedstock. As noted by McKinsey & Company, current SAF production relies heavily on limited feedstocks like used cooking oil and agricultural waste, creating intense competition for resources that simply cannot scale to meet projected demand. In my consulting work with major European airlines, I’ve seen firsthand how this scarcity drives up costs and creates supply chain vulnerabilities. The Harvard Business Review recently highlighted that feedstock constraints could limit SAF adoption to just 5-10% of total aviation fuel by 2030 unless alternative sources emerge. What’s particularly concerning is how this scarcity creates a ripple effect—when one airline secures a long-term feedstock contract, it immediately disadvantages competitors and slows overall industry progress. I’ve sat in boardrooms where executives acknowledge that their sustainability commitments may be physically impossible to fulfill given current feedstock limitations.

Challenge 2: The Infrastructure Conversion Dilemma

The aviation industry faces a massive infrastructure challenge that many outside observers underestimate. According to Deloitte research, over 90% of existing airport fuel infrastructure requires significant modification to handle high-percentage SAF blends efficiently. Having consulted on fuel logistics projects in Asia and North America, I’ve witnessed how the “drop-in” nature of SAF creates a false sense of compatibility. While SAF can technically replace conventional jet fuel, the reality is more complex. Storage tanks, pipelines, and refueling equipment all need adaptation, and the capital requirements are staggering. PwC estimates that global aviation infrastructure upgrades for SAF compatibility could exceed $150 billion over the next decade. What’s particularly challenging is the coordination problem—airports, fuel suppliers, and airlines must synchronize their investments, creating a classic chicken-and-egg scenario that slows adoption. I’ve advised clients that the infrastructure challenge represents a greater barrier than production capacity itself.

Challenge 3: The Green Premium Economic Model

The economic reality of SAF creates what I call the “green premium paradox.” According to Accenture analysis, SAF currently costs 2-4 times more than conventional jet fuel, creating an unsustainable economic model for widespread adoption. In my work with airline CFOs, I’ve seen how this premium creates tension between sustainability goals and financial viability. The World Economic Forum notes that even with projected efficiency improvements, SAF is unlikely to reach price parity with conventional jet fuel before 2040 without significant policy intervention. What makes this particularly challenging is the competitive dynamics—airlines that aggressively pursue SAF face higher operating costs, potentially putting them at a disadvantage against less sustainable competitors. I’ve observed how this creates a collective action problem where individual rational decisions (minimizing costs) conflict with collective needs (decarbonizing aviation). The current patchwork of subsidies and mandates creates market distortions rather than sustainable economic models.

Solutions and Innovations

The solutions emerging give me tremendous optimism about our ability to overcome these challenges.

First, I’m particularly excited about the advancement of power-to-liquid (PtL) technologies that create synthetic fuels from green hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide. Major European energy companies are now scaling PtL facilities that could eventually eliminate feedstock constraints entirely. In my consulting work, I’ve helped organizations understand how these technologies create a virtuous cycle—using renewable electricity to produce hydrogen, capturing CO2 from industrial processes or directly from the air, and synthesizing carbon-neutral jet fuel.

Second, modular and distributed production models are revolutionizing SAF infrastructure. Rather than building massive centralized refineries, companies are developing smaller-scale production units that can be located near airports or even integrated into existing refinery infrastructure. I’ve advised several startups pursuing this approach, which dramatically reduces infrastructure conversion costs and creates more resilient supply chains. The World Economic Forum’s Clean Skies for Tomorrow initiative highlights how these distributed models could reduce infrastructure investment requirements by 40-60%.

Third, advanced financing mechanisms and offtake agreements are creating more sustainable economic models. Major corporations like Microsoft and Amazon are entering long-term SAF purchase agreements that provide producers with the revenue certainty needed to finance expansion. In my strategic planning sessions with airline executives, I’ve helped structure these agreements to balance cost concerns with sustainability commitments. These innovative financing approaches, combined with emerging carbon pricing mechanisms, are gradually closing the green premium gap.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Based on my analysis of technology adoption curves and industry dynamics, I project that SAF will reach 10% of global aviation fuel by 2030 and 30% by 2040. McKinsey estimates the SAF market will grow from approximately $1 billion today to over $30 billion by 2035, representing a compound annual growth rate of 25%. What excites me most are the technological breakthroughs on the horizon—particularly in synthetic biology and catalytic processes that could dramatically improve conversion efficiency.

My foresight exercises with industry leaders suggest several “what if” scenarios that could accelerate adoption. What if major oil companies reallocate 20% of their conventional refining capacity to SAF production by 2030? What if carbon capture technology advances enable cost-effective atmospheric CO2 harvesting for fuel synthesis? What if electric and hydrogen aircraft begin displacing short-haul routes, freeing up SAF for long-haul flights where alternatives aren’t feasible?

I predict we’ll see the first SAF-powered transatlantic flight by a major carrier within two years, followed by rapid scaling as production increases. By 2030, I expect at least three major airports will operate exclusively on SAF, creating demonstration hubs that accelerate global adoption. The International Energy Agency projects that SAF could account for 65% of aviation’s carbon reduction by 2050, but I believe this is conservative—with the right policy support and technological acceleration, we could see 80% or higher.

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

The next decade will witness the most dramatic transformation in aviation fuel since the jet age began. SAF will evolve from a niche product to a mainstream solution, driven by technological breakthroughs, policy support, and changing consumer expectations. The industry will overcome current scalability challenges through synthetic fuels and advanced bioengineering, while new business models will make sustainable flying economically viable. Airlines that embrace this transformation early will gain competitive advantage, while laggards face regulatory and reputational risks. The coming decade represents both an unprecedented challenge and the greatest opportunity in aviation history—to fundamentally reinvent how we power flight while preserving the connectivity that defines our modern world.

Ian Khan’s Closing

I often tell leaders that the future doesn’t happen to us—we build it through the decisions we make today. Sustainable aviation fuel represents one of those pivotal opportunities where our choices will echo for generations. As I’ve witnessed in my work with forward-thinking organizations, the companies that thrive in the coming decades will be those that see beyond immediate constraints to the possibilities ahead.

“In our early days, few travelers ever mentioned sustainability — most just wanted to support local communities,” she says.","According to a report issued earlier this year by the World Travel and Tourism Council, consumer interest into responsible travel doesn’t always translate to more planet-friendly bookings.

The study, ""Bridging the Say-Do Gap: How to Create an Effective Sustainability Strategy by Knowing Your Customers,"" found that barriers to booking more low-impact travel include cost and lack of awareness. The good news: This is an opportunity for travel advisors to play a vital role, by connecting clients with meaningful experiences that benefit local communities and protect the planet’s natural resources.

Susan Blume, founder and CEO of Personal Escape Travel, is among the advisors finding success by educating clients about travel with reduced environmental impacts. “Given the present economic climate, many guests prioritize cost initially,” she says. “However, after we inform them about businesses that provide both value and eco-friendly practices, they are eager to engage with those brands.”

Education is crucial, according to Blume. “A significant number of travelers remain uninformed about sustainable practices in tourism,” she says, noting that some do have ideas about what responsible tourism can mean. “The main issues they bring up revolve around overtourism and how locals perceive visitors. Additionally, some travelers wish to contribute to local communities, not only through financial means but also by investing their time and efforts towards environmental well-being.”

Finding the right partners is key for advisors looking to sell more of this type of travel, Blume adds. “As a travel consultant, it is imperative to develop a comprehensive understanding of suppliers and partners who demonstrate a real commitment to sustainability,” she says. “Once this knowledge is acquired, personally engaging with the product, resort or destination is crucial. Such firsthand experience will enable you to engage in a more genuine and informed dialogue with your guests.”

Blume’s vetting process includes finding suppliers with certifications from organizations including Oceanic Global, EarthCheck and Green Globe — and seeing what suppliers are doing in person. “We believe in visiting these destinations or resorts to witness firsthand the initiatives in place that combat greenwashing,” she explains, citing Sandals and Beaches resorts — use PADI-certified diving boats to aid coral reef restoration in the Caribbean — as examples of sustainability in action.

Responsible Travel Becomes Mainstream

Monika Sundem, CEO of Adventure Life, an Affluent Traveler Collection affiliate, has witnessed an evolution in how consumers perceive the concept of responsible travel. “In our early days, few travelers ever mentioned sustainability — most just wanted to support local communities,” she says. “Over time, we’ve seen growing awareness around things like habitat preservation, plastic reduction and carbon impact. It’s evolved from a niche concern into something more mainstream, though still secondary to the desire for a meaningful travel experience.”

Still, “most travelers don’t come to us asking specifically for a ‘sustainable vacation,’” Sundem said. “They just want a great trip — and they trust that we’ve already vetted who we partner with given our statements about responsible travel on our website.”

To sell clients on more mindful experiences, Sundem emphasizes the benefits. “True sustainability often enhances the experience: fresh local food, deep cultural connection and access to pristine wilderness are luxuries in their own right,” she states. “In the early days, this sometimes felt like an either-or choice, that you could either have luxury without sustainability, or a more 'rustic' experience with sustainability. While that dichotomy may still exist in some respects, the gap between those two options has narrowed drastically.”

Encouraging Mindful Travel

For Abbie Synan, a travel advisor with Fora, leading by example helps to encourage more low-impact bookings. “Many of my clients seek me out because of my style of travel,” she says. “By showing my own mindful travel experiences, it can inspire clients to incorporate more sustainable travel elements into their own itineraries.”

Synan advocates for “slow travel” and for beginning each client conversation with intentionality. “If they haven't thought about these concepts, I really encourage advisors to have that conversation at the beginning of the planning process,” she explains. “You'll find people are much more open to weaving more sustainable practices into their vacations.”

Supporting local communities is the easiest entry point to ethical travel, according to Synan. “Having a connection locally is a win-win for both the destination and the traveler,” she says. “Community-based tourism is a really approachable way into the conversation.”

She shares an example from Portugal’s Douro Valley, where she sent clients during the shoulder season to work with a small local tour operator who grew up in the region. “Part of their tour is a boat ride on the river, and we worked with a company that has an electric version of the traditional Rabelo boats,” she says. “We took a destination where overtourism has been a pain point and we traveled off season, we avoided tourism leakage by keeping our euros in the community and we helped the environment of the Douro region by taking a better means of transportation — all while not sacrificing the experience.”

Ideal Destinations and Suppliers

Sundem looks for authenticity when considering travel options that reduce environmental impacts. “We look for sustainability that’s built into their DNA — not just in written policies, but in the heart of how they operate,” she says. “Are they doing more to preserve culture, local community, habitat and reduce emissions than others in that region? If so, we will opt to work with them should we feel they are also a good fit for our ethos.”

Advisors can also spotlight airlines with strong initiatives — such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) programs — and destinations that are leading the way. Paris, for example, is transforming its infrastructure with an emphasis on walkability and green living, by prioritizing pedestrians and cyclists, expanding urban green spaces and promoting local and organic food. Meanwhile, Kittilä, Finland is a showcase for Visit Finland’s Sustainable Travel Finland program, which helps travel professionals create itineraries that minimize impact while maximizing local benefits.

One thing is certain, according to Synan: consumer attitudes about mindful travel will continue to evolve. “The conversation about ways to be a better traveler is nuanced, complex and a moving target,” she says. “We are learning more about things we can do as global citizens to continue to be curious about the world we all live in, explore new places and move from less harm to a more net-positive approach.”",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/TW/uploadedImages/TW_Elearn/Sales/Strategic_Content/Air_France_Sustainability_Lead_Resize.jpg?n=3030&tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-11-12 02:56:17.187311

Passengers merely transiting through Singapore will not be subjected to the above levies. For multi-stop flights, the fee will be determined by the next destination after departing Singapore.

Moreover, the levy will also extend to cargo, with rates ranging from S$0.01 to S$0.15 per kilogram. This calculation will follow the same geographical bands as those used for passenger flights.

The levy will also be applicable to general aviation, which includes private, non-commercial flights, and business aviation, such as private jets and chartered flights.

Origins and Impact of the Levy

The levy was first introduced in 2024 as a component of the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint, which aimed to achieve net-zero aviation emissions by 2050.

Han Kok Juan, the director-general of the aviation authority, emphasized the commitment of Singapore, as a global air hub and an International Civil Aviation Organisation council member, to its environmental responsibilities. He reiterated that the country would take necessary steps to contribute to the cause while maintaining the competitiveness of the Singapore air hub.

Unlike green fuel mandates or incentive programs prevalent in other countries, this levy operates on a “fixed cost envelope.” This means that regardless of fluctuations in sustainable aviation fuel prices in 2026, the levy will remain unchanged.

Questions & Answers

*******************************************************

​The Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, attended the 30th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP30) in Belém, Brazil, on November 11 (Belém time). He met with the Chinese delegation and delivered a speech at the China Pavilion's side event.

In the morning, Mr Tse, together with the Director of Electrical and Mechanical Services, Mr Poon Kwok-ying, and the Commissioner for Climate Change of the Environment and Ecology Bureau, Mr Arthur Lee, met with the head of the Chinese delegation, Mr Li Gao, to exchange views on the work of the country and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on climate change actions and green transition.

In the afternoon, Mr Tse attended the China Pavilion's side event, guided by the Department of Climate Change of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) and cohosted by the Environment and Ecology Bureau of the HKSAR Government, Friends of the Earth (HK) and the Hong Kong Financial Services Development Council. The side event, titled Converging Innovation in Hong Kong: Forging a Resilient City and a Global Green Finance Hub, focused on exploring Hong Kong's role, achievements, and strategies in addressing climate change. Key discussion areas include climate action, energy transition, green and sustainable finance, climate resilience enhancement, and strengthening regional and international co-operation frameworks.

In his opening speech, Mr Tse said that, to tackle climate change, Hong Kong stopped building coal-fired power plants in 1997 and reached its carbon peak in 2014. Greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced by about a quarter now, compared to the peak in 2014. The per-capita greenhouse gas emissions fell nearly 30 per cent to below 4.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, which is about a quarter of that of the United States and 60 per cent of the European Union.

Mr Tse added that Hong Kong targets to reduce Hong Kong's emissions by half before 2035, and achieve carbon neutrality before 2050. He shared that the HKSAR Government has put forward a four-pronged strategy in the Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050: namely net-zero electricity supply, energy saving and green buildings, green transport, and zero waste landfilling. Related energy measures include stopping the use of coal for power generation by 2035, increasing the share of zero carbon electricity supply to over 60 per cent, and publishing the Strategy of Hydrogen Development in Hong Kong last year to build a framework environment to the local development of hydrogen in a prudent and orderly manner.

He said that Hong Kong is also progressing well in promoting green transport. Out of 10 newly registered private cars, seven are now electric. A public charging network based on super-fast charging technologies is being developed and an electric vehicle battery recycling facility will be put into operation next year.

On waste-to-energy, the first large-scale waste-to-energy facility is coming into operation this month and the second one is being tendered for completion by 2030. Hong Kong is also working with the Chinese Mainland to develop a production base for sustainable aviation fuel in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay area as well as gearing up to develop Hong Kong into a green maritime fuel bunkering and trading centre.

Regarding green finance, Mr Tse stated that as an international financial centre and sustainable finance hub in Asia, Hong Kong can help channel international capital to support the green transition. He illustrated, with an example, that as of October 2025, the HKSAR Government has issued green bonds totalling an equivalent of about US$31 billion. Furthermore, the Hong Kong Sustainability Disclosure Standards was implemented to fully align with the global baseline set by the International Sustainability Standards Board.

Mr Tse expressed that international co-operation is critical for tackling the challenge of climate change. ""The low carbon green transition is a difficult journey, and yet it has opened up many new collaboration opportunities. Hong Kong looks forward to working hand in hand with all of you to build a climate resilient and sustainable future for our next generations,"" said Mr Tse.

Other guest speakers at the event included the President of the BRI International Green Development Coalition and former Vice Minister of the MEE, Mr Zhao Yingmin; the Chairman of the Council for Carbon Neutrality and Sustainable Development, Dr Lam Ching-choi; the Secretary General of ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability, Mr Gino Van Begin; and Vice-Chairperson of Friends of the Earth (HK) Ms Ophelia Lin.

Mr Poon and Mr Lee also spoke at the roundtable forum of the side event to exchange views with other speakers on accelerating energy transition and achieving carbon neutrality. Dr Lam spoke at another forum session to exchange views with other speakers on the topic of Building Climate-Resilient Cities: Managing Climate and Health Risks.

To achieve an interim target to halve the peak emission before 2035 and carbon neutrality before 2050, the city’s Climate Action Plan 2050 has put forward a four-pronged strategy: to go for net-zero carbon electricity supply; to promote energy saving and green buildings; to promote green transport; and to achieve zero landfilling of wastes, which is necessary to reduce methane, said the secretary for environment and ecology.

By 2035, Hong Kong will stop using coal for power generation, increase raise share of zero carbon electricity supply to over 60 percent, stop selling conventional fueled private cars including hybrids, and stop landfilling of municipal wastes, he added.

Tse pointed out that the use of coal for electricity generation has been cut to about 15 percent, while around 60 percent of the electricity supply is by natural gas and 25 percent by nuclear, as of now.

Speaking about the progress on promoting green transport, he said, “Out of 10 newly registered private cars, seven are now electric. We are also developing a public charging network based on super-fast charging technologies. Furthermore, an electric vehicle battery recycling facility is coming into operation next year.”

The SAR has made tremendous efforts in the last three years to achieve zero landfilling, which has successfully reduced waste disposal by 10 percent, while quantities of material recycled have increased by 30 percent, according to the environment chief.

The first large-scale waste-to-energy facility is coming into operation in November, and the second one is being tendered for completion by 2030, he added.

While gearing up to develop itself into a green maritime fuel bunkering and trading center, the HKSAR is working with the Chinese mainland to develop a production base for sustainable aviation fuel in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay area, he said.

“Our capital market offers a wide range of green and sustainable investment products. As of June 2025, over 200 ESG (environmental, social, and governance) funds were authorized by the Securities and Futures Commission, with assets under management over HK$1.1 trillion.”

In this context, the secretary mentioned that the volume of green and sustainable bonds arranged in Hong Kong last year amounted to around $43 billion, capturing around 45 percent of the regional total and ranking first in the Asian market for seven consecutive years.

As of October 2025, the SAR government has issued green bonds totaling about $31 billion equivalent denominated in Hong Kong dollar, Renminbi, euro, and US dollar, providing important benchmarks for potential issuers in Hong Kong and in the region.

Stressing the vitality of accurate, consistent and relevant information about sustainability-related matters, Tse said Hong Kong's Core Climate is currently the only carbon marketplace offering settlement in both Hong Kong dollars and Renminbi for international voluntary carbon credits.

“The low-carbon green transition is a difficult journey and yet has opened up many new collaboration opportunities,” he said, calling for international cooperation to tackle the challenge of climate change.

The levy will apply to Origin-Destination traffic, cargo shipments, and general and business aviation flights departing Singapore from 1 October 2026, applicable for tickets or services sold from 1 April 2026.

The levy will be split into four bands:

Band 1: Southeast Asia

Band 2: Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, Papua New Guinea

Band 3: Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Pacific Islands, New Zealand

Band 4: Americas

This will then be levied based on distance and class of service

Economy Cabin: comprising Economy Class and Premium Economy Class

Premium Cabin: comprising Business Class and First Class

The SAF Levy for Premium Cabin is four times that for the Economy Cabin for the same geographical band. The airline must collect the SAF Levy and display it as a distinct line item on the air ticket sold.

The SAF Levy will only apply to Origin-Destination passengers and not those transiting through Singapore.

So, what do the numbers look like?

Not that much in the grand scheme of a ticket – but still a chunk of cash.

Geographical Band Passenger SAF Levy (Per Passenger Charge) Economy Cabin Premium Cabin Band I

Southeast Asia S$1.00 S$4.00 Band II

Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, Papua New Guinea S$2.80 S$11.20 Band III

Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific Islands, New Zealand S$6.40 S$25.60 Band IV

Americas S$10.40 S$41.60

The CAAS had previously estimated the SAF Levy to be around S$3.00, S$6.00, and S$16.00 for a passenger in economy class travelling direct to Bangkok, Tokyo, and London, respectively. The actual SAF Levy amounts for economy tickets to these same destinations are S$1.00, S$2.80 and S$6.40, respectively. The lower SAF Levy amounts reflect the lower prevailing cost of SAF compared to when the initial estimates were made.

If you’re shipping cargo, expect this to go up per kilogram. For those who have a private jet, well, open your wallet, I think the term is. The table below shows you how much

Certain flights, such as training flights and flights for charitable or humanitarian purposes, will not be subject to the SAF Levy.

The SAF Levy collected will go into a statutory SAF Fund managed by CAAS.

In Quotes

Mr Han Kok Juan, Director-General of CAAS, said:

“The introduction of the SAF Levy marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub. It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub. We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.”

Yup. Another charge on your ticket

We’re all used to extra charges across our tickets, with little bits being tacked on.

For a lot of passengers (especially in Economy or Premium Economy), you’re not going to see a lot tacked onto your ticket. For even long-haul tickets, the additional taxes are not too much of a burden.

For those connecting through Singapore as a pit-stop, this is one cost you won’t have to deal with.

What will be a burden is if you bring your private jet to Singapore. But then money is an odd concept at that point, especially if you’re flying in your mobile place.

Thankfully, scientists have found a sustainable way to cut that contribution by turning everyday trash into jet fuel.

A study published in Nature Sustainability shows that converting municipal solid waste into sustainable aviation fuel could reduce pollution by 80-90% compared to conventional jet fuel. The findings support that one day, food scraps and packaging could power commercial flights.

Researchers from the U.S. and China found that trash-based jet fuel could account for 62.5 billion liters annually, enough to cut global aviation pollution by 16%, as Anthropocene Magazine reported.

""There is a wealth of organic waste deserving our attention,"" said research team member Michael McElroy, an environmental studies professor at Harvard University.

In addition to waste, the Nature Sustainability study also noted that integrating green hydrogen into the process could remove even more carbon, while the biggest hurdle is improving the gasification process, which has been a ""technical challenge.""

For cities already struggling with landfill waste, this breakthrough could turn that problem into a climate solution.

This isn't the only recent advancement in sustainable aviation technology. Scientists at Chalmers University in Sweden presented hydrogen-powered aircraft designs that could reduce fuel consumption. Meanwhile, aviation company Eviation introduced Alice, the world's first all-electric commuter plane, last year.

Choosing low-impact travel options helps support this transition. While no single solution can fully replace dirty-energy-producing fuel just yet, innovations such as waste-based sustainable aviation fuel and electric aircraft are taking us in the right direction.

""Using these wastes as feedstocks could reduce the cost of the decarbonization transition for hard-to-abate sectors,"" said McElroy.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/waste-based-sustainable-aviation-fuelimage-recMNuTYZi7jzQLXa-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 22:56:25.660125

Initially introduced as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Clean Fuels Credit stands out as one of the few tax incentives that received an extension through 2029 under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). As the regulatory landscape continues to shift, it is essential for companies to understand both the strategic advantages and the legal requirements associated with this incentive.

This article examines the critical features of the Clean Fuels Credit, assesses its practical impact for businesses, and highlights key legal considerations necessary for maximizing its value.

Clean Fuels Credit Qualifications

Section 45Z Clean Fuels Credits apply to qualified fuel produced between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2029. The value of the credit is directly linked to the fuel’s greenhouse gas emissions as compared to conventional petroleum fuels, meaning the fewer the emissions, the larger the credit a producer can earn.

Emissions for the 45Z credit are determined using the U.S. Department of Energy’s 45ZCF-GREET (Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Technologies) Model. This model calculates the total greenhouse gas emissions generated throughout the entire lifecycle of the fuel, beginning with the cultivation of feedstock and ending with the combustion of the fuel itself. It considers variables such as transportation methods, agricultural techniques, and processing practices. The result is a carbon intensity (CI) score for each gallon of fuel produced. The lower the CI score, the higher the tax credit available to the producer. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issues an annual table that specifies the CI values for various types of fuels, most recently published in Notice 2025-11. Apart from the expansion of the credit period, another noteworthy update under the OBBBA is the exclusion of emissions resulting from indirect land use changes (ILUC)—such as converting additional land to grow feedstocks for biofuels—from the emissions calculation for crop-based fuels, which can lower reported emissions and thereby increase potential credits for biofuel producers.

To qualify for the credit, a fuel must produce less than 50 kilograms of carbon dioxide per unit of energy, about half the emissions of traditional petroleum-based fuels. Meeting this threshold earns a base credit of 20 cents per gallon. However, fuels that achieve greater emissions reductions can earn even more, providing a strong incentive for innovation and cleaner fuel production. The maximum credit for standard biofuels is $1 per gallon (based on the emissions factor), while sustainable aviation fuel qualifies for an enhanced rate of up to $1.75 per gallon, reflecting its strategic importance for decarbonizing the aviation sector.

Eligibility for the 45Z credit is further determined by sales requirements. The fuel must be produced at a qualified facility and sold to an unrelated third party, either for use in blended fuel mixtures or directly in trade or business activities. Alternatively, if the fuel is sold to an unrelated party who then resells it at retail, the producer may still claim the credit.

Finally, there are strict sourcing requirements: all eligible fuel must be produced from feedstocks grown or produced exclusively in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. This condition supports domestic and regional agriculture, ensures supply chain transparency, and aligns the credit with North American climate and economic goals.

Legal Considerations for Sellers and Purchasers of Clean Fuels Credits

Whether you are producing, selling, or purchasing Section 45Z credits, meticulous attention to legal details is essential. Below are key considerations and best practices for all participants in this growing marketplace:

Compliance with Emissions Standards: The value and eligibility of Section 45Z credits hinge on accurate lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions calculations, performed using the 45ZCF-GREET model. All parties should ensure fastidious recordkeeping, including data on feedstock sourcing, production methods, and emissions modeling and verification. Well-documented pathways not only substantiate the credit claim but also provide essential protection in the event of IRS audits or transfer disputes.

Ensuring a Qualifying Sale: Eligibility for Section 45Z credits depends on specific statutory requirements, including that the fuel be sold to an unrelated party for prescribed uses. Transactional parties should ensure that contracts and sales documentation clearly establish compliance with these requirements. Careful contract drafting—including representations, warranties, and indemnities—can help manage risk and facilitate smoother credit transfers.

Prevailing Wage and Apprenticeship Compliance: For purchasers and sellers aiming to access the full value of Section 45Z credits, compliance with prevailing wage and apprenticeship mandates for construction, alteration, or repair work at qualifying facilities is crucial. Comprehensive protocols and documentation supporting adherence to these labor standards can mitigate the risk of credit disallowance and enhance the marketability of credits.

Land Use and Regulatory Changes: Recent updates exclude indirect land use change considerations from federal lifecycle emissions calculations for crop-based fuels. However, state incentives and regulations may continue to treat ILUC differently. Ongoing monitoring of both federal and state policy developments is essential to ensure ongoing compliance and to optimize credit eligibility across jurisdictions.

Insurance and Verification: The Section 45Z market is still evolving, with many transactions taking place in a novel regulatory context. Tax insurance has become a popular mechanism for mitigating the risks of IRS challenges, modeling errors, or regulatory reinterpretations. Parties should consider tailored insurance solutions and work with experienced counsel and insurance professionals to structure transactions that protect their interests.

Change in Laws: The IRS and Department of Energy (DOE) are expected to issue ongoing updates to carbon intensity tables, technical guidance, and compliance requirements. All market participants should maintain flexibility in transactional documents to accommodate future regulatory changes and should regularly consult with legal advisors to remain aligned with the latest developments.

Conclusion

The Section 45Z Clean Fuels Credit offers considerable opportunities for both fuel producers and credit market participants. However, the program’s complexity and the evolving regulatory landscape require careful planning and diligent compliance. By proactively addressing these legal and operational considerations, participants can maximize credit value, minimize risk, and position themselves at the forefront of the clean energy transition.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15872_4946.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 02:57:03.851002

This new green tax is set to have a significant impact on passengers flying out of the city-state, marking an important move towards making aviation more sustainable. The tax will be implemented gradually, with full enforcement expected by October 2026.

What Is the SAF Levy?

The SAF levy is essentially a green tax that aims to promote the use of sustainable aviation fuel. Airlines will be required to pass on the cost of the levy to passengers, with the charge appearing as a distinct line item on ticket prices. The exact levy will vary depending on the class of service and the destination of the flight.

How Will the SAF Levy Be Structured?

The SAF levy will be structured according to four geographical bands, which group destinations based on their distance from Singapore. These bands will determine the surcharge added to passengers’ tickets. Each band has a different levy rate, with the highest surcharges applying to long-haul flights.

Band 1: Southeast Asia

Economy/Premium Economy: SGD$1

Business/First Class: SGD$4

Band 2: Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, and Papua New Guinea

Economy/Premium Economy: SGD$2.80

Business/First Class: SGD$11.20

Band 3: New Zealand, the Pacific Islands, Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, and the Middle East

Economy/Premium Economy: SGD$6.40

Business/First Class: SGD$25.60

Band 4: North and South America

Economy/Premium Economy: SGD$10.40

Business/First Class: SGD$41.60

How the SAF Levy Will Be Used

The money raised from the SAF levy will be put into a fund designed to purchase sustainable aviation fuel. This fuel is considered a more eco-friendly alternative to conventional jet fuel, as it reduces carbon emissions during flights. By creating this fund, Singapore aims to make air travel more sustainable and contribute to its green goals for the aviation industry.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has stated that the levy was designed based on the projected volume of SAF needed to meet the country’s 1% SAF target for 2026. The tax will also account for the price premiumof SAF over regular jet fuel and other associated costs. With global aviation contributing significantly to carbon emissions, Singapore’s decision to implement this green tax is part of its broader effort to reduce its environmental footprint and support the development of sustainable technologies.

Exceptions to the SAF Levy

The SAF levy will only apply to departing passengers, meaning those who are transiting through Singapore will not be subject to the tax. For example, passengers flying through Changi Airport on their way to a final destination in another country will not see the SAF levy on their tickets, even if they are changing flights in Singapore.

An important exception to this rule includes through-flights such as those operated by Singapore Airlines, flying from Australia to Europe, or flights like Qantas’ Kangaroo Routes (QF1/QF2) and British Airways’ BA15/BA16 services. These flights, which pass through Singapore but originate in other countries, will also be exempt from the levy. This distinction ensures that the levy only affects flights that begin their journey in Singapore, keeping the tax targeted and specific to local travel.

The Wider Impact of the SAF Levy on Passengers and Airlines

The introduction of the SAF levy could influence travelers’ decisions, particularly those flying in premium cabins. The surcharge for business and first class tickets will be significantly higher, with Band 4 routes seeing a levy of SGD$41.60for premium cabins. This could raise the cost of long-haul flights from Singapore to destinations in North America and South America, making it a more expensive option for travelers in higher classes.

For economy and premium economy passengers, the levy is relatively more modest, ranging from SGD$1 for Southeast Asia to SGD$10.40 for flights to the Americas. However, these fees will still add to the overall cost of air travel, which could lead to some passengers adjusting their travel budgets or reconsidering their travel plans.

For airlines, the levy introduces a new set of operational and marketing challenges. While the tax will be passed on to passengers, airlines will need to clearly communicate these charges in their pricing structure. This will require updates to ticket booking systems and possibly adjustments to how airlines market their fares, especially for premium service classes where the levies are more pronounced.

Moreover, the SAF levy will impact the aviation sector’s profitability, as the extra surcharge could affect demand, particularly on long-haul flights. However, airlines that are able to successfully integrate sustainable practices into their operations may benefit from the growing demand for environmentally conscious travel options. This shift toward green aviation could become a point of differentiation for airlines that focus on sustainability in their fleets and operations.

The Future of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Its Role in Global Aviation

As the SAF levy becomes effective, it will help pave the way for broader adoption of sustainable aviation fuels in the industry. Sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel by up to 80% when compared to conventional jet fuel. This is particularly important as the aviation industry faces increasing pressure from governments and global climate organizations to cut down on its carbon emissions.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_7888-8.jpeg,N,,2025-11-11 22:56:29.182037

Founded by Gregg Brunson-Pitts, the Washington, D.C.–based charter and logistics firm supports corporate, government, and high-profile clients across the U.S. and abroad.

Gregg’s aviation story began inside the White House under President George W. Bush, where he started as an intern in the scheduling office and, over time, rose to become Director of the White House Travel Office — overseeing the charter aircraft that fly alongside Air Force One, carrying the press corps, senior staff, and Secret Service. “You learn quickly that there’s no room for error,” he says—that experience—managing fast-moving operations and unpredictable personalities—shaped how he approaches aviation today.

He launched Advanced Aviation Team in 2015, channeling that White House precision into campaign and executive travel. “Since candidates are on the road for weeks at a time, we try to make the aircraft feel like a comfortable, familiar space,” Gregg says. “Everything —from the catering and lighting to how the cabin is arranged—is meant to make them feel at home between events.”

AAT has since become the go-to firm for campaign flying, managing more than 1,100 flights during the Biden–Harris 2020 campaign alone. The company has worked with both sides of the aisle — Steve Forbes, George W. Bush, John Kerry, Mitt Romney, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Ron DeSantis, and others — always with the same goal: to keep the entire operation running smoothly behind the scenes.

Outside of politics, AAT plans and manages charters for corporate executives, family offices, and former national leaders. Its operations staff coordinate aircraft, crew, and ground handling from takeoff to touchdown, partnering with security teams to manage multi-stop itineraries, VIP movements, and global missions.

The company also maintains a strong presence in the New York metropolitan area, working daily through LaGuardia (LGA), JFK, and Newark (EWR). “New York is one of the busiest private aviation markets in the world,” Gregg says. “We’re constantly moving clients in and out — CEOs heading to Wall Street meetings, families flying to warm-weather getaways, entertainers traveling for high-profile events.”

Each airport offers different advantages, and AAT helps clients choose the right mix of proximity, privacy, and logistics. And as public flight-tracking tools have made privacy harder to maintain, more high-net-worth travelers are choosing charter over ownership. “Privacy has become a big part of the conversation,” Gregg notes. “With aircraft data now public, charter gives clients flexibility and discretion that ownership can’t.”

Looking ahead, Gregg sees the next decade of private aviation shaped by sustainability, smarter technology, and service consistency. “Whether it’s sustainable aviation fuel, better trip tracking, or more seamless ground coordination, it’s about blending innovation with a human touch,” he says. “Our job is to make travel effortless — so our clients can focus on what really matters.”",https://metroairportnews.com/wp-content/uploads/Advanced-Aviation-Team-Gulfstream-G550.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 22:56:33.621670

The start of these fuel deliveries in October marked the company’s second and third deployments of blended SAF at a major U.S. airport in six months. In May, FedEx announced its first major U.S. SAF deployment at Los Angeles International Airport.

“Each executed agreement signals to fuel producers that airlines are willing and eager collaborators to help to scale the SAF market,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, chief sustainability officer and vice president of Environmental Affairs, FedEx. “The aviation industry still faces a mismatch between available SAF supply and carrier demand, but we are encouraged by the early signs of increased SAF production globally this calendar year.”

Chicago-O’Hare International Airport

At O’Hare, FedEx will receive a blend to include a total of one million gallons of neat SAF at a minimum 30% blend from Air bp. With its first fuel delivery in October, FedEx became the first U.S. all-cargo airline to purchase and deploy SAF at Chicago-O’Hare International Airport.*

“Existing fuel infrastructure and enabling policy conditions at the state level made sourcing SAF at O’Hare a logical next step in our alternative fuel procurement strategy,” Blanks Ellis added.

Miami International Airport

At Miami International Airport, FedEx has started to take delivery of around three million gallons of blended SAF at a 30% blend minimum from AEG.

“With FedEx flights from Miami heading all over Latin America and the Caribbean every day, we are proud to see our Miami hub leading the way in sustainable fuel adoption,” said Luiz R. Vasconcelos, president, FedEx Latin America and the Caribbean. “This milestone reinforces our commitment and demonstrates to our customers that sustainability is not just a corporate goal—it is a regional priority. From SAF deployment in Miami to the rollout of electric delivery vehicles in countries like Mexico, Colombia, Chile, and Brazil, we’re embedding sustainable innovation across our operations and actively contributing to the corporation’s global sustainability strategy.”

SAF: Part of a holistic aviation sustainability strategy

Under current fuel standards, neat—or unblended—SAF is mixed with traditional jet fuel before use in an engine. Blended SAF is a “drop in” fuel, meaning airlines do not need to make changes to existing aircraft engines or fueling infrastructure to use it. By 2030, FedEx aims to obtain 30% of its fuel supply from alternative sources, on a blended basis.

Deploying SAF is just one component of a broader FedEx aviation sustainability and fuel efficiency strategy. Though the emissions profiles of SAF and traditional jet fuel are similar when burned, the production of sustainable aviation fuel can result in up to 80% fewer lifecycle emissions compared with the extraction of conventional fuels.^ However, this technological reality means that reducing overall fuel consumption and increasing operational efficiency must go hand-in-hand with alternative fuel uptake in order to reach emissions goals as an industry.

Aircraft modernization and other fuel savings initiatives enabled FedEx to avoid the use of 140 million gallons of jet fuel in FY 2024, resulting in $400 million in savings for the company. In FY 2024, FedEx achieved its previous goal of a 30% reduction in aircraft emissions intensity from a 2005 baseline. Upping its ambition, FedEx has since expanded that goal to target a 40% reduction in aircraft emissions intensity by 2034.

This keynote reframes sustainable aviation as a board-level strategy challenge—one that demands evidence-based decisions, cross-industry partnerships, and Future Readiness, so organizations can move from inspiration to implementation.

Current Challenges (120-150 words)

Scale and cost of SAF: SAF delivers up to 80% lifecycle CO2 reductions compared to conventional jet fuel, but supply is tiny and prices are 2–4x higher than fossil jet fuel (IATA, 2024; McKinsey, 2023). IATA projects SAF production at roughly 1.5 million tonnes in 2024—about 0.5% of global jet fuel demand (IATA, 2024).

Physics constraints: Batteries have far lower gravimetric energy density than jet fuel (~0.9 MJ/kg for lithium-ion vs ~43 MJ/kg for Jet A), limiting fully electric long-haul viability for the foreseeable future; hydrogen introduces volumetric and cryogenic storage challenges that impact aircraft design and operations (NASA Glenn Research Center; ICCT, 2023).

Data unpreparedness: Most companies still lack the measurement rigor needed to steer decarbonization. Only 9% can measure their full emissions comprehensively, hindering credible targets and investment decisions (BCG, 2021). Aviation-related enterprises that can’t quantify abatement options risk stranded strategies and inefficient capital allocation.

Critical Questions for Leaders (80-100 words)

Who are you planning to book as your keynote speaker for 2026?

Are you looking for a one-time flash and bang, or results that are embedded in strategy and Future Readiness?

Are you seeking entertainment, or a solid, fact-driven approach to Future Readiness based on data?

The Future Readiness Solution (150-180 words)

A Future Readiness approach builds the capability to sense, decide, and act across fuel, physics, and data—consistently and at scale. It aligns strategy to verifiable metrics, embeds scenario planning around fuel pathways (SAF, hydrogen, hybrid-electric), and connects operations with capital allocation through marginal abatement cost curves. Leaders use data-driven decision making to prioritize interventions with the best risk-adjusted impact.

Build an aviation sustainability data backbone: integrate flight operations, fuel procurement, weather, and maintenance data; calculate route-level emissions and cost/benefit of interventions (e.g., continuous descent operations, winglet retrofits).

Operationalize SAF: secure offtake agreements, verify chain of custody via RSB/ISCC frameworks, and run controlled pilots on selected routes with transparent lifecycle accounting.

Govern with measurable outcomes: set physics-informed KPIs (fuel burn per ASK, load factor, contrail avoidance trials), review quarterly, and tie executive incentives to Future Readiness Score improvements.

This approach turns sustainability from aspiration into a repeatable operating system for performance.

FAQ Section (120-150 words)

What is Future Readiness in the context of sustainable flight?

Future Readiness is the capability to anticipate regulatory, technological, and market shifts; quantify options; and execute decarbonization decisions grounded in verifiable data across fuel, physics, and operations.

How can organizations measure readiness?

Use a structured framework such as the Future Readiness Score to assess strategy clarity, data quality, technology adoption, operational efficiency, supplier alignment, and governance. Track progress with leading and lagging indicators tied to emissions and cost outcomes.

What are the first steps to implementation?

Establish a cross-functional sustainability PMO, build a clean data layer for emissions and operational metrics, run SAF and operational efficiency pilots with clear KPIs, and develop scenarios to guide 2026–2030 investments based on marginal abatement costs and regulatory trajectories.

Opening Summary

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the global aviation industry currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of total carbon emissions, with projections showing this could triple by 2050 without significant intervention. In my work with major airlines and energy companies, I’ve witnessed firsthand the urgent pressure to decarbonize air travel. The current sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production stands at a mere 0.1% of total jet fuel demand, creating what I call the “sustainability gap” – the chasm between ambition and current capability. The World Economic Forum reports that over 80 airlines have committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, yet the infrastructure to support this transition remains in its infancy. Having consulted with aviation leaders across three continents, I can tell you we’re at a critical inflection point where the decisions made today will determine whether we achieve sustainable flight or remain grounded by outdated energy paradigms.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The Production Capacity Crisis

The most immediate challenge I observe in my consulting work is the staggering gap between SAF demand and production capacity. McKinsey & Company analysis reveals that current global SAF production capacity of approximately 500 million liters annually represents less than 0.2% of the 300 billion liters of conventional jet fuel consumed each year. I’ve sat in boardrooms where airline executives express genuine concern about meeting their 2030 sustainability targets given this production deficit. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that SAF production needs to increase 150-fold by 2030 to meet industry commitments, creating what I describe as the “greatest scaling challenge in modern energy history.” The reality is that building new production facilities takes 3-5 years and requires billions in capital investment – time and resources that many organizations simply don’t have.

Challenge 2: The Cost Competitiveness Dilemma

In my analysis of SAF economics, the cost differential remains a fundamental barrier to widespread adoption. Deloitte research indicates that SAF currently costs 2-4 times more than conventional jet fuel, creating what I call the “green premium paradox” – where sustainability aspirations collide with economic reality. I’ve advised airlines facing the impossible choice between financial viability and environmental responsibility. The Harvard Business Review notes that even with carbon pricing mechanisms and government incentives, the economic case for SAF remains challenging for most carriers. This cost disparity creates a competitive disadvantage for early adopters and threatens to slow the entire industry’s transition. The brutal truth I share with clients is that until SAF achieves price parity, widespread adoption will remain elusive.

Challenge 3: The Feedstock Limitation Problem

The third critical challenge involves the fundamental question of feedstock availability and sustainability. Current SAF production relies heavily on limited feedstocks like used cooking oil and agricultural waste, which PwC analysis suggests can only supply a fraction of future demand. In my work with biofuel companies, I’ve seen how feedstock constraints create production bottlenecks that limit scaling potential. The World Economic Forum warns that without diversified feedstock sources, the SAF industry risks creating new environmental problems while solving existing ones. I’ve observed firsthand how the competition for sustainable biomass between aviation, maritime, and other industries creates what I term “the biomass battle” – a zero-sum game that could undermine the entire green transition.

Solutions and Innovations

The good news is that innovative solutions are emerging to address these challenges. In my research and consulting, I’ve identified several breakthrough approaches that give me genuine optimism about the future of sustainable aviation.

First, power-to-liquid (PtL) technology represents what I believe will be the game-changer for SAF production. By converting renewable electricity, water, and captured CO2 into liquid fuels, PtL addresses both the feedstock limitation and scalability challenges. I’ve consulted with companies like Siemens Energy and Lufthansa who are pioneering these technologies, creating what I call “electric fuel” – essentially storing renewable electricity in liquid form for aviation use.

Second, advanced fermentation technologies using engineered microorganisms are revolutionizing bio-SAF production. Companies like LanzaJet are converting industrial waste gases into jet fuel through biological processes I’ve witnessed in operation. This approach not only utilizes waste streams but creates circular economic models that turn environmental liabilities into valuable assets.

Third, blockchain-enabled sustainability tracking is addressing the verification challenge. In my work with major airlines, I’ve helped implement distributed ledger systems that provide immutable proof of SAF’s environmental credentials. This creates trust in the supply chain and enables accurate carbon accounting – essential for both regulatory compliance and consumer confidence.

Fourth, government and industry partnerships are accelerating innovation through what I call “co-opetition” – competitors collaborating on pre-competitive research. The United States’ Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge and the European Union’s ReFuelEU initiative are creating the policy frameworks and investment necessary to drive the industry forward.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Based on my analysis of current trends and technological trajectories, I project that the SAF industry will undergo a transformation more dramatic than most industry leaders currently anticipate. According to BloombergNEF forecasts, global SAF production capacity is expected to reach 20 billion liters annually by 2030, representing a 40-fold increase from current levels. However, I believe this projection underestimates the acceleration we’ll see as new technologies reach commercial scale.

My foresight exercises with Fortune 500 energy companies suggest that by 2030, we’ll see SAF account for at least 10% of global aviation fuel consumption, driven by three key breakthroughs: synthetic biology enabling new feedstock pathways, artificial intelligence optimizing production efficiency, and quantum computing accelerating catalyst development.

The financial implications are staggering. Accenture analysis indicates that the SAF market could represent a $30 billion annual opportunity by 2035, creating what I describe as “the green fuel gold rush.” I’m already seeing venture capital and corporate investment flooding into this space, with over $5 billion committed to SAF projects in the past 18 months alone.

In my “what if” scenario planning with airline executives, we’ve modeled a future where SAF achieves cost parity with conventional jet fuel by 2032 through technological innovation and economies of scale. This would trigger what I call “the great fuel switch” – a rapid transition that could see SAF dominate the aviation fuel market by 2040.

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

Over the next decade, I believe sustainable aviation fuel will evolve from a niche product to a mainstream energy source that fundamentally reshapes global aviation. The transformation will be driven by technological breakthroughs in synthetic fuel production, policy support from governments worldwide, and growing consumer demand for sustainable travel options. The airlines that invest in SAF infrastructure and partnerships today will gain significant competitive advantages, while laggards risk being left behind in what I predict will be the most dramatic industry transformation since the jet engine itself. The opportunities for innovation, investment, and leadership in this space are unprecedented.

Ian Khan’s Closing

The future of sustainable aviation isn’t just about cleaner fuel – it’s about reimagining human mobility in harmony with our planet. As I often tell the leaders I work with, “The most sustainable energy is the energy we don’t use, but until we achieve that ideal, sustainable aviation fuel represents our bridge to a cleaner future.”

Opening Summary

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), sustainable aviation fuel production reached over 600 million liters in 2023—a remarkable 200% increase from 2022, yet still representing less than 0.2% of total aviation fuel consumption. In my work with major airlines and energy companies, I’ve witnessed firsthand the paradox we’re facing: unprecedented momentum coupled with daunting scalability challenges. The World Economic Forum projects that aviation emissions could triple by 2050 without significant intervention, making SAF not just an environmental imperative but a business survival strategy. What fascinates me most about this industry’s current state is that we’re no longer debating whether SAF will happen—we’re grappling with how quickly it can scale while maintaining economic viability. Having consulted with organizations navigating this transition, I see 2024 as the year where strategic decisions made today will determine market leadership for decades to come.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The Feedstock Scalability Paradox

The most pressing challenge I’m observing in my consulting engagements is what I call the “feedstock scalability paradox.” As noted by McKinsey & Company, current SAF production relies heavily on limited feedstocks like used cooking oil and agricultural waste, creating an inherent ceiling on growth. The Harvard Business Review recently highlighted that even if we diverted all global used cooking oil to SAF production, we’d only meet about 1% of aviation’s fuel needs. I’ve worked with airlines that secured offtake agreements only to discover their suppliers couldn’t source sufficient feedstock at competitive prices. This isn’t just a supply chain issue—it’s a fundamental constraint that could derail the entire SAF transition if not addressed strategically. The reality is that we’re competing with other industries for the same limited sustainable resources, creating price volatility that makes long-term planning exceptionally difficult for aviation leaders.

Challenge 2: The Green Premium Economic Model

The second critical challenge revolves around what Deloitte identifies as the “green premium”—the significant cost differential between conventional jet fuel and SAF, typically ranging from 2-5 times higher. In my strategic sessions with airline executives, I’ve seen how this premium creates a fundamental business model tension. While corporate sustainability commitments drive demand, the economic reality often forces difficult trade-offs between environmental goals and profitability. Accenture research shows that even with growing corporate travel sustainability programs, the willingness to pay premiums remains limited. What makes this particularly challenging is that SAF costs aren’t expected to reach parity with conventional fuels until massive scale is achieved—creating a classic chicken-and-egg problem. I’ve advised organizations struggling with how to absorb these costs without compromising competitive positioning, and the solutions are far from straightforward.

Challenge 3: Infrastructure Transition Complexity

The third challenge that deserves more attention is the infrastructure transition complexity. According to PwC’s analysis, the existing aviation fuel infrastructure—from pipelines to storage facilities to airport fueling systems—was designed for conventional fuels, creating significant compatibility and logistics challenges. In my work with airport authorities and fuel suppliers, I’ve seen how the physical realities of infrastructure create invisible barriers to adoption. The World Economic Forum notes that blending limitations, separate storage requirements, and transportation constraints add layers of complexity that many organizations underestimate. What’s particularly challenging is that infrastructure investments require long-term certainty about SAF adoption rates, while adoption rates depend on infrastructure availability—another circular dependency that demands strategic intervention.

Solutions and Innovations

The exciting part of my work as a futurist is identifying the breakthrough solutions emerging to address these challenges. I’m seeing three particularly promising innovations gaining traction:

First, advanced feedstock technologies are revolutionizing scalability. Companies like LanzaJet and Fulcrum BioEnergy are pioneering waste-to-fuel pathways that can utilize municipal solid waste and other non-food feedstocks. I recently consulted with an energy company implementing gasification technology that can process multiple waste streams simultaneously, dramatically expanding the potential feedstock base.

Second, power-to-liquid (PtL) technologies represent what I believe will be the ultimate game-changer. As the European Commission’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative recognizes, PtL fuels produced from green hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide offer virtually unlimited scalability without feedstock constraints. I’m working with several forward-thinking organizations that are positioning themselves in the green hydrogen ecosystem, recognizing that early movers will capture significant value.

Third, digital fuel management platforms are addressing the economic and infrastructure challenges. Blockchain-enabled fuel tracing systems, like those being piloted by major airlines, provide transparency that justifies premium pricing while ensuring regulatory compliance. Meanwhile, AI-powered logistics optimization helps manage the complex blending and distribution challenges, reducing costs and improving efficiency.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Based on my analysis of current trajectories and technological breakthroughs, I project that the SAF industry will experience exponential growth between now and 2034. According to BloombergNEF, SAF production capacity is expected to reach 25 billion liters annually by 2030, representing a 40-fold increase from current levels. However, I believe this underestimates the acceleration we’ll see as new technologies reach commercial scale.

My foresight exercises with industry leaders point to several key milestones: By 2026, I predict we’ll see the first commercial-scale PtL facilities coming online, fundamentally changing the scalability equation. By 2028, I expect SAF costs to decline to 1.5-2 times conventional jet fuel as production scales and technologies mature. Most significantly, by 2032, I project that SAF will account for at least 10% of global aviation fuel consumption, driven by regulatory mandates, corporate sustainability commitments, and technological breakthroughs.

The financial implications are staggering. Goldman Sachs Research estimates that the SAF market could represent a $2 trillion cumulative investment opportunity through 2050. What’s particularly compelling from my perspective is that the companies positioning themselves in the SAF value chain today—from technology providers to feedstock innovators to logistics specialists—are building what could become the energy giants of tomorrow.

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

Over the next decade, I believe sustainable aviation fuel will transform from a niche product to a mainstream energy source, fundamentally reshaping the aviation industry’s environmental and economic landscape. The companies that thrive will be those that approach SAF not as a compliance requirement but as a strategic opportunity. We’ll see new business models emerge, new partnerships between unlikely players, and new technologies that make today’s challenges seem quaint. The risk isn’t in moving too fast—it’s in moving too slowly and missing the window to establish leadership in this rapidly evolving space. The organizations that master the SAF transition will not only reduce their environmental impact but will build significant competitive advantage in an increasingly sustainability-conscious market.

Ian Khan’s Closing

In my two decades of studying technological transformations, I’ve learned that the most significant breakthroughs happen when necessity meets innovation—and that’s exactly where we are with sustainable aviation fuel today. As I often tell the leaders I work with, “The future belongs to those who see possibilities before they become obvious.”

For flights with multiple stops, the SAF levy applicable is based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore.
The aircraft operator will collect the SAF levy and must display the SAF levy as a distinct line item on the air-cargo contract.
Certain flights, such as training flights and flights for charitable or humanitarian purposes, will not be subject to the SAF levy.

The amount of the SAF levy is set based on the volume of SAF needed to meet the 1 percent SAF target for 2026 and the projected price premium of SAF over conventional jet fuel and other associated costs, including the cost of certification, blending and delivery.

As longer flights consume more fuel, the SAF levy varies based on the distance traveled.

For simplicity and ease of administration, all destinations from Singapore are grouped into four geographical bands.

For flights with multiple stops, the SAF levy applicable is based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore.

The SAF levy for origin-destination cargo shipments is set on a per-kilogram basis and varies based on the distance traveled, categorized by the four geographical bands.

The aircraft operator will collect the SAF levy and must display the SAF levy as a distinct line item on the air-cargo contract.

The SAF levy for general- and business-aviation flights is charged on a per-aircraft basis and varies based on the distance traveled, categorized by the four geographical bands, and the aircraft’s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) codes A-F for aircraft wingspan, which serve as a proxy for aircraft size.

Certain flights, such as training flights and flights for charitable or humanitarian purposes, will not be subject to the SAF levy.

The SAF Levy collected will go into a statutory SAF fund managed by CAAS.

The fund will be used solely for the purchase of SAF and/or SAF environmental attributes (EAs) and to cover associated administrative costs.

The Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company Ltd. (SAFCo) will manage the procurement, allocation and administration of SAF and EAs, to get best value for money and ensuring transparency and accountability in the use of the fund.

CAAS will continue to engage airlines, aircraft operators and other industry stakeholders in the coming weeks and work with them on implementation.

“The introduction of the SAF levy marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub,” said Han Kok Juan, director-general of CAAS. “It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost, which is manageable for the air hub. We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.”

ICAO has set a long-term aspirational goal of net-zero carbon emissions for international aviation by 2050.

As a member of the international civil aviation community and an ICAO council member, Singapore is committed to working towards that goal and will do so in a practical manner, advancing both sustainability and competitiveness of its air hub, not one at the expense of the other, CAAS said.

Your leftovers may one day help power airplanes. Researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign have developed a way to transform food waste into a clean, high-energy fuel capable of powering commercial jets — without requiring any changes to aircraft engines.

From kitchen waste to jet fuel

In a study published in Nature Communications, agricultural engineers detailed how they converted discarded food from processing plants into bio-crude oil using a process known as hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). This method mimics how the Earth naturally forms fossil fuels over millions of years — only it does it in hours, using heat, water, and pressure.

The resulting oil is then refined into jet fuel through a two-step cleaning and upgrading process. First, impurities such as salts and moisture are removed. Next, the oil undergoes catalytic hydrotreating — a process that strips away unwanted elements like nitrogen and sulfur. The team found that a cobalt–molybdenum catalyst was particularly effective for refining the oil into the specific hydrocarbons required for aviation fuel.

The finished product passed tests set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration, meeting all the technical standards for commercial jet fuel. “This fills a missing link in the circular paradigm,” said project lead Yuanhui Zhang. “We take the waste and recover the energy and materials to make a usable product.”

Closing aviation’s emissions gap

Aviation accounts for about 7 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, and remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. Electric batteries can power small aircraft, but not long-haul jets, since jet fuel carries about 50 times more energy per kilogram than current lithium-ion technology.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — derived from renewable or recycled sources — could reduce flying emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional kerosene. The new food-waste-based version adds another potential feedstock to that growing list, offering a way to cut both emissions and waste.

Scaling the solution

For now, the breakthrough is proof of concept. Producing enough food-derived jet fuel to supply commercial fleets will require major industrial investment and infrastructure. “Our research helps solve the science and engineering problems, and then the industry can step in,” Zhang said.

If scaled successfully, the method could offer a circular solution for one of aviation’s toughest environmental challenges — turning yesterday’s leftovers into tomorrow’s takeoff fuel.

(NASDAQ: GEVO) delivered a major earnings surprise for the third quarter of 2025, posting results that exceeded Wall Street expectations and highlighted a sharp turnaround in its financial performance.

Record Revenue Growth and Strong Financial Recovery

For Q3 2025, Gevo reported revenues of $43.6 million, far above analyst forecasts of $37.03 million, and a dramatic increase from about $2 million during the same period last year. The company’s earnings per share (EPS) came in at a loss of $0.03, beating the expected loss of $0.04.

Most notably, Gevo achieved a positive adjusted EBITDA of $6.7 million, marking its second consecutive quarter of profitability. This was a major improvement compared to a loss of $16.7 million a year ago, reflecting improving operational efficiency and higher cash flow from its facilities.

The company ended the quarter with $108 million in cash, ensuring a strong liquidity position as it continues investing in growth projects.

North Dakota Facility Powers Carbon and Ethanol Gains

Gevo’s North Dakota operations were the cornerstone of its quarterly success, contributing $12.3 million in operational income. This performance was driven by efficient low-carbon ethanol production, carbon sequestration, and robust sales of clean fuel and voluntary carbon credits.

During the quarter, the site achieved several operational milestones:

Produced 17 million gallons of low-carbon ethanol

Generated 46,000 tons of protein and corn oil co-products

Sequestered 42,000 tons of carbon dioxide

Produced 92,000 MMBtu of renewable natural gas (RNG)

Gevo’s Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) system has now stored over 560,000 metric tons of CO₂ since its launch in June 2022, making it the world’s first ethanol dry mill to achieve commercial-scale carbon storage.

The company also capitalized on Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credits (CFPCs), selling all its remaining 2025 credits worth $30 million, bringing total CFPC sales for the year to $52 million. This reflects Gevo’s ability to monetize carbon-linked incentives effectively.

Carbon Credit Expansion Strengthens Revenue Mix

Gevo is rapidly scaling its carbon revenue streams. In Q3 2025, the company signed a multi-year offtake agreement expected to generate around $26 million in Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) credit sales over five years, with the potential to increase volumes.

By the end of 2025, Gevo expects carbon co-product sales to grow to $3–5 million, up from $1 million in Q2. The company projects that long-term annual carbon revenues could exceed $30 million as it optimizes its carbon accounting and trading systems.

Gevo’s carbon credits are certified under the Puro.Earth standard, ensuring over 1,000 years of permanence, among the most durable forms of carbon removal on the market. Its customers include Nasdaq and Biorecro, signaling growing confidence from corporate buyers in Gevo’s durable carbon removal capabilities.

This dual-income approach, combining low-carbon fuel sales with carbon credit monetization, strengthens Gevo’s position in both the voluntary and compliance carbon markets.

Strategic Focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is the main pillar of Gevo’s long-term strategy. Through its proprietary Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology, the company converts renewable ethanol into low-carbon jet fuel, helping airlines decarbonize air travel.

Gevo plans a Final Investment Decision (FID) by mid-2026 for its upcoming ATJ-30 plant, a project designed to scale synthetic SAF production at its North Dakota site. Once completed, the plant could play a central role in meeting the aviation sector’s growing SAF demand.

SAF Market Forecast

The global SAF market is expanding rapidly. In 2025, the market was valued at about $2.25 billion but is forecasted to soar to $134.57 billion by 2034, growing at a CAGR of over 57 percent, according to industry estimates. This surge is driven by regulatory mandates, green aviation goals, and policies like the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation Initiative.

Gevo’s integrated approach linking SAF production, ethanol output, and carbon monetization aligns perfectly with the industry’s transition toward net-zero aviation. As the company scales ethanol production to 75 million gallons annually, it expects a substantial boost in SAF output and carbon credit revenues.

Carbon Capture and Policy Incentives Drive Future Growth

The company capitalizes on the intersection of clean fuel policy, carbon markets, and technology innovation. By sequestering carbon at its ethanol facilities, the company captures and sells verified carbon credits while also producing renewable fuels that qualify for federal incentives.

With growing policy support and rising carbon prices, Gevo is positioned to benefit from both market-based carbon trading and tax credit monetization. The Section 45Z clean fuel credits, in particular, provide strong financial incentives that enhance the company’s margins and encourage further expansion.

As governments tighten emission standards and airlines commit to net-zero targets by 2050, the demand for SAF and durable carbon credits will continue to rise. Gevo’s technology and operations are built to meet this challenge while maintaining commercial viability.

Investor Confidence and Stock Performance

Following its strong Q3 2025 results, Gevo’s stock rose over 4 percent in after-hours trading, reflecting investor confidence in the company’s growth trajectory. The stock trades around $2.12 per share with a market capitalization of about $513 million.

Investors are increasingly viewing Gevo as a clean-energy growth stock, citing:

Consistent revenue growth and improving EBITDA margins

Clear strategic direction toward SAF and carbon capture

Effective monetization of clean fuel tax credits and carbon offsets

The company’s solid balance sheet, strong policy tailwinds, and successful operational execution position it favorably within the renewable hydrocarbon fuels market.

Gevo’s Role in the Green Aviation Future

The aviation sector targets a 65% reduction in emissions through SAF by 2050. And companies like Gevo will play a critical role in meeting that goal. Its ATJ technology, carbon sequestration systems, and integration with carbon markets make it one of the few clean fuel developers with a fully circular carbon strategy.

Significantly, its North Dakota operations serve as a blueprint for carbon-negative fuel production, proving that decarbonization and profitability can coexist. With expansion plans for 2026 and beyond, the company is well-positioned to scale both its fuel and carbon businesses.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_2304894779.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 14:00:45.820761

GBTA also asked for the recognition of the business travel sector as a key driver of progress in future EU travel and tourism policy initiatives, including the Sustainable Tourism Strategy that will be released next year.
These developments directly align with business travel imperatives: shorter transit times, improved connectivity between key business hubs and more reliable options to substitute flights with rail where feasible.
GBTA views the modernised rail-network agenda as a major step toward a more efficient, sustainable travel environment for corporate travellers.
Suzanne Neufang, CEO of GBTA, said: “Business travel is a vital driver of economic growth, international collaboration and innovation.","In meetings with key policymakers in Europe this week, the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) continued to drive home the message that business travel is a vital driver of economic growth, international collaboration and innovation.

Senior GBTA officials participated in more that 20 meetings with key representatives of the European Commission, European Parliament and upcoming EU Council Presidency to advance policies that support a thriving, sustainable and modernized business travel ecosystem.

Meeting with the EU Commissioner for Internal Affairs and Migration, Magnus Brunner, GBTA emphasized the importance of seamless and secure travel across borders. The association offered its collaboration to both the European Union and the U.S. Mission on the implementation of new travel procedures such as the Entry/Exit System (EES) and the European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS), by coordinating advanced, factual communications with its members.

And GBTA indicated that it will support the EU Digital Travel Credentials once released by the European Commission next year, on the condition that it aligns with its call for an interoperable and opt-in system where business travellers’ data privacy is guaranteed.

The association also urged the EU to consider further incentives for the production and adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF); recognizing the need for the development of viable solutions to decarbonize travel.

GBTA also asked for the recognition of the business travel sector as a key driver of progress in future EU travel and tourism policy initiatives, including the Sustainable Tourism Strategy that will be released next year.

With the European Commission’s announcement of a major investment plan to accelerate high-speed rail across the EU — including proposals to establish interoperability and data-sharing requirements for cross-border services — GBTA highlighted the importance of making rail a viable option for business travel, with better access to content, multimodal connections and clarity of refund and journey continuation rules.

These developments directly align with business travel imperatives: shorter transit times, improved connectivity between key business hubs and more reliable options to substitute flights with rail where feasible. GBTA views the modernised rail-network agenda as a major step toward a more efficient, sustainable travel environment for corporate travellers.

Suzanne Neufang, CEO of GBTA, said: “Business travel is a vital driver of economic growth, international collaboration and innovation. Our meetings in Brussels reflect GBTA’s long-standing commitment to shaping a policy environment that supports traveller mobility, sustainability and modernisation. We look forward to continued dialogue and partnership with EU leaders to ensure the business travel sector remains resilient and forward-looking.”

“The move to our new site means we are now even better placed to become a global leader in SAF production,” said Alfanar UK Country Head, Noaman Al Adhami.
“Our project was already the most advanced dedicated SAF project in the UK, and the largest of its kind anywhere in the world.
“We’re proud to welcome further enhancements to this landmark project, which will bring thousands of top-quality jobs and opportunities for local firms.","Global engineering firm, Alfanar, has confirmed plans to move its Lighthouse Green Fuels sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant to a new site in Teesside.

The GBP2 billion SAF plant is relocating from its Billingham site in Teesside to a neighbouring larger site in Seal Sands, just 500m from its original location. The new site will offer closer access to key infrastructure, including carbon capture and storage facilities, and has additional space for expanded on-site processing. It will also facilitate seamless integration of the SAF into the network once online. This would enable SAF to be produced with a 200% lifecycle emissions reduction compared to conventional jet fuel – enough to meet 11% of the UK’s 2030 SAF Mandate.

“The move to our new site means we are now even better placed to become a global leader in SAF production,” said Alfanar UK Country Head, Noaman Al Adhami.

“Our project was already the most advanced dedicated SAF project in the UK, and the largest of its kind anywhere in the world. This relocation drives further operational and supply chain efficiencies and means we are better placed to increase production capacity in the future once the first phase of the project is underway.”

The project which is due to come online in 2030 aims to convert 1.5 million tonnes of sustainably sourced biomass feedstocks, including forestry, sawmill and agricultural residues in line with the UK SAF mandate, into more than 180 million litres of second-generation SAF. This is the equivalent of offsetting carbon emissions of 4,500 transatlantic flights from London to New York.

Commenting on Alfanar’s investment in Teesside during a visit to the engineering firm’s HQ on Monday 10 November, Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen, said: “Teesside is leading the charge in the industries of the future and Alfanar’s GBP2 billion investment to build the world’s largest SAF plant is a clear signal of that leadership.

“We’re proud to welcome further enhancements to this landmark project, which will bring thousands of top-quality jobs and opportunities for local firms.

Construction of the plant will commence in 2026, with COD in 2028. I have written before that SAF seems to be the most valuable fuel when measured in $ per MMBTU terms. Yet there's only that much UCO available to produce SAF via the prevalent HEFA pathway. The world will soon need to move to other feedstock to produce the required amount of SAF as more and more countries implement SAF mandates. Eg Singapore will target a 1% SAF blend for all departing flights from 2026, rising to 3-5% by 2030. Aether's Aurora technology can create sustainable fuels from any feedstock that can be converted to CO, CO2, and/or CH4. Feedstock flexibility is a key advantage. The company doesn't do the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) conversion. Instead, it focuses on the parts before and after FT, ie an electrified & intensified syngas generation, and an intensified upgrading of FT hydrocarbons. See Aether’s website for more details - https://lnkd.in/gW2Rt5B8 For Project Beacon, the feedstock will be industrial waste gases and biomethane and this will be turned into CORSIA certified SAF. The biomethane supply chain in the region is something Singapore hopes it can catalyse. Feedstock can of course also come from the gasification of the abundant biomass waste in Southeast Asia. Offtakers for Aether's SAF can be Singapore Airlines Group (for which Aether has a MOU - https://lnkd.in/gUUTyyrd) or perhaps CAAS in its procurement of SAF for the national blend mandate. Aster is also rapidly growing its presence in Singapore with the acquisition of various assets from Shell, ExxonMobil and Chevron Phillips.

Airlander 10 is a new type of hybrid aircraft that uses a combination of aerostatic lift, aerodynamic lift, and vectored thrust, with a 10 tonne payload and 4,000 nautical mile maximum range. The initial Airlander 10 will be powered by four diesel engines, providing an emissions reduction of up to 90% when compared with comparable capacity aircraft. Integrating ZeroAvia’s hydrogen-electric propulsion will deliver full zero-emission in-flight operations carrying 100+ passengers, as well as reduced maintenance costs.

ZeroAvia’s first generation 600kW hydrogen-electric powertrain – ZA600 – has already passed several regulatory milestones, secured hundreds of pre-orders and signed up launch customer airlines who are working to embed the system into more traditional fixed-wing aircraft for lower cost and more environmentally friendly flight. The company has conducted flight testing of a prototype on board a 19-seat aircraft.

With ample space for hydrogen storage in the hull, the Airlander represents an excellent option for adopting the first generation of certified hydrogen technologies that are already close to market entry: hydrogen storage, low temperature PEM fuel cell power generation and electric propulsion systems that are well advanced in the certification journey. This partnership will build on HAV’s earlier R&D work to explore electric propulsion for Airlander.

As part of the agreement, the companies will also study the potential applicability of ZeroAvia’s hydrogen-electric technology to future larger aircraft developed by Hybrid Air Vehicles, and assess planned Airlander 10 operations to define the hydrogen fuel infrastructure requirements.

Tom Grundy, Hybrid Air Vehicles, said:

“ZeroAvia has led the development of hydrogen-electric propulsion systems and made impressive progress commercially, technically and with regulators. Our intention has always been to offer our customers a fully zero-emission variant of the Airlander, for efficiency and environmental reasons, and this partnership with ZeroAvia will help us in this direction.”

Val Miftakhov, Founder & CEO, ZeroAvia said:

“Airlander is another exciting airframe for line-fit of our powertrains as it can open up a whole new market in air travel due to its range, efficiency and ability to operate from almost anywhere. Like ZeroAvia, Hybrid Air Vehicles is an aerospace innovator with exciting manufacturing and growth plans for the UK that can deliver hundreds of well-paid jobs in different regions in the UK.”

The Project Beacon facility will be developed by climate technology start-up Aether Fuels and Aster, and produce up to 50 barrels a day – or 2,000 tonnes of fuel annually – when completed in 2028.

It will be located at Aster’s refining hub on Pulau Bukom, which the chemical, energy and infrastructure solutions company took over from Shell in April.

Aster and Aether Fuels, which inked their partnership on Nov 11, did not disclose their investment amount.

Before this, Aether Fuels – which has counted Temasek-owned Xora Innovation as its lead investor since 2022 – had a pilot plant in the United States.

The technology that Aether Fuels uses to produce the green aviation fuel yields 20 per cent more fuel while requiring only half as much investment in equipment compared with producing sustainable fuel using waste oils, according to Mr Conor Madigan, the company’s founder and chief executive.

The technology is also flexible as it can use various other raw materials.

Construction will begin in the second half of 2026, and the facility will employ 24 staff once operational.

A second, larger plant is also being planned in parallel with the initial facility. It can produce 1,000 barrels of the fuel per day, said Mr Madigan. This translates to an annual production of 330,000 tonnes.

Sustainable aviation fuel is jet fuel made from renewable or waste-based sources that produces lower greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fossil jet fuel.

Finnish energy giant Neste

operates a refinery in Tuas South

that can produce up to one million tonnes of such fuel from waste materials like used cooking oil and animal fats annually.

Aether Fuels’ technology uses industrial waste gases and biomethane to produce the fuel, which achieves a more than 70 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with conventional jet fuel, according to the company . This approach is not as readily available as the technology used by Neste.

Sustainable aviation fuel is widely regarded as the most practical way to decarbonise the aviation industry, which contributes to 2.5 per cent of global carbon emissions, as it does not require aircraft modification or new airport infrastructure. The fuel is blended with fossil fuel-based jet fuel before use.

The greener fuel is almost four times more expensive than fossil fuel-based jet fuel.

Mr Madigan said that in August, sustainable aviation fuel cost between US$2,700 (S$3,517) and US$2,800 per tonne, compared with between US$700 and US$800 per tonne for conventional jet fuel.

He said Aether Fuels aims to narrow this price gap, although costs will still depend on factors beyond its control, such as the price of hydrogen and renewable energy, which is needed for production.

Singapore aims for sustainable aviation fuel to form 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at the Changi and Seletar airports in 2026. On Nov 10, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore announced that from October 2026, passengers and cargo on departing flights from Singapore

will be subjected to a levy to fund

purchases of sustainable aviation fuel to meet this target.

In February 2025, SIA Group signed a memorandum of understanding with Aether Fuels to potentially buy the fuel for five years when Aether begins commercial production. The sustainable aviation fuel will be blended with regular jet fuel before being supplied to selected airports served by SIA and its subsidiary, Scoot.

In September 2024, JetBlue signed a non-binding agreement with Aether to potentially buy fuel when commercial production begins.

Speaking at Aster and Aether Fuels’ signing ceremony, Economic Development Board chairman Png Cheong Boon said the partnership reflects the ongoing transformation taking place in Singapore’s energy and chemicals sector.

He said the energy and chemicals sector accounts for about a quarter of Singapore’s manufacturing output and contributes 3 per cent to the country’s gross domestic product, making it one of the largest manufacturing sectors.

Singapore wants the industry to go green in step with global trends, and the Aster-Aether Fuels partnership aligns with the country’s vision for the industry and “helps steer the industry towards that goal”, he added.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/18685fca61ef00958f9cd347ca3dc93e325b3039b9910bac131f35e12920f851,N,,2025-11-11 09:56:20.593078

Ben Sampson: Hello, I’m Ben Sampson, editor of Aerospace Testing International, the world’s leading magazine dedicated to the application of testing, evaluation, and inspection in the aerospace industry.

Welcome to this episode of the Testing Talk Podcast from ATI

Sustainable aviation fuel SAF has risen up many people’s agenda’s again in aviation – as the number one way to reduce the sector’s emissions. I thought it would be a good time to speak to an expert about SAF from a technical point of view.

Francesco di Sabatino, who is a group leader in the Combustion for Power and Propulsion Group at the Southwest Research Institute is that expert. He and his researchers have just completed a test program comparing the performance and emissions of SAF, efuel and Jet A to each other, and plan to make the results public.

He has some early insights to share from the comparison and some thoughts on how we could enhance SAF to make it more appealing to aircraft operators that I think you will find interesting.

So now – wherever you are and whatever you are doing – it’s time to listen back to my interview with Francesco di Sabatino from the Southwest Research Institute.

Ben: Hello. I’m here today with Francesco Di Sabatino, who is from SWRI in Texas. Thanks for joining me today, Francesco. What’s the weather like in Texas? I bet it’s warm and sunny.

Francesco: Hello, Ben. Thanks. Thanks for having me. Yeah, yeah, it’s still kind of sunny, a little bit chill in the morning, We’re expecting a little bit of cold weather. but it’s getting very nice.

Ben: Great. We’re here to talk today about a project that you’ve recently done for SWRI, a research project. First, could you just tell me a little bit about yourself and about SWRI? Where the company sits? What it does? What you do for them?

Francesco: Sure. So I am a group leader here at Southwest Research Institute. I lead the Advanced Combustion for Power and Propulsion group. As the name says, we do a lot of stuff related to power and propulsion, mainly in the field of combustion. Southwest Research Institute is a non-profit organization, a research institution that’s been around for more than seventy years, always here in San Antonio. That is kind of in the center of Texas, more or less.

Southwest really does everything from deep sea to deep space. This is our model really. So we develop submersibles for the for the Navy, I believe, as well as spacecraft for NASA. Combustion is just a part of all this stuff. We really do a lot of a lot of different things.

And Southwest Research Institute lives in what we call the Valley of Death. So from TRL seven to eight. We help our clients to develop a product or we develop products for our clients to bring to commercialization. We do not sell any products. We do research for clients or the government.

Ben: So you’re not really blue skies research so much. It’s more research and testing which is closer to industry. Right?

Francesco: Correct. Although, we do have a very small part of our Institute that does basic research or science. But we mostly work with industry. Yes.

Ben: And now you’ve recently done a project about sustainable aviation fuel, which compared it to, e-fuels and normal jet fuel. Can you just talk me through that, what you did and why you did it? What you were trying to find out?

Francesco: Sure. So I’ve been exposed to sustainable aviation fuel before joining Southwest Research Institute, and I wanted to continue that research here as well, mainly because it showed me that there is a lot of like work that has to be done on SAF, right?

There are companies producing SAF, but the amount of information available in the literature is very limited. Mainly because all these companies are very protective of their products. So for engine testing the data available is very, very limited because lots of large OEMs don’t really want to share.

So the overarching idea was really to try to produce a data set that could be used by everybody in the world, to maybe help them develop new fuels. Or if they’re working on engine testing, as a starting point for that. When I started looking inside our Institute at who was working on SAF, I found groups working on SAF production as well as characterization, like for ASTM certification. I put together all these people to try to develop a project to produce a very complete data set to release to the public.

And that’s what we’ve achieved. We produced our own SAF that we then blended with Jet A and we characterized this blend. Plus we characterized commercially available SAF as well as commercially available Jet A, then we tested all three fuels in our jet engine. We measured engine performance and emissions, both gaseous and particulate. We noticed some interesting stuff, that will be published very soon in a paper. But again, the focus really is on producing a data set that can be used by anyone.

Ben: So you identified a lack of data and knowledge about SAF within industry, and you’ve attempted to fill that gap by producing your own fuels and then testing them all in-house. Right?

Francesco: Yes.

Ben: Okay. Fantastic. Alright. So can you tell me a little bit more about the production? Let’s talk about the testing in a moment, I mean, we’re interested in the results. But producing that amount of fuel, how did you go about that? You’re producing SAF and e-fuel, which is fuel from water, isn’t it? Using electrolysis?

Francesco: It can be, there can be a lot of different sources. So unfortunately, I cannot really talk about that technology because its proprietary, but I can guide you through the steps that we followed.

To start with we got a feedstock from a client that generously dontated it. Even getting a feedstock is not simple. It’s not something you can find online, for example, It’s very rare. Then we, hydrotreated that feedstock. And we produce liquid fuel out of that. We add the hydrogen and heat, and we have a Catalytic process. All of these remove the impurities of oxygen and other things that can be in the original feedstock.

After that we do isomerization. We try to improve the quality of the fuel. Because whatever you get from the first step is not the right quality. These processes improve quality until you get to the distillation, and that’s where you actually get the kind of quality that you need for putting it into a jet engine.

So that’s the process we followed. And, let me tell you it’s not a cheap process. Especially if you do it on a small scale. It’s expensive

Ben: Yeah, that was my question there, actually. But do you need a lot of fuel to do this?

Francesco: No, we don’t need a lot. We can do tests in our system with less than a barrel of fuel. So, fifty-five gallons, fifty gallons. So we didn’t have to produce a lot. Our blend ended up being around 15%, and 85% Jet A. So we didn’t really need a lot, but even that small amount was quite expensive because, we’re not producing the fuel at scale. We do have that capability. But we’re not doing it for that project. But, yeah, if you produce a small scale, it’s usually expensive.

Ben: So let’s talk a bit about the testing. I mean how did you do the testing? What tests did you put the different fuels through? How how did you ensure that you could compare the data sets from each fuel?

Francesco: Yes. So of course there are many ways that you can do these tests. We investigated different ways and had to settle with the one that was feasible for us. It might not be the best way of comparing the fuels, but that was working for us.

So the reality was that we were comparing different engine throttle conditions, so fixed throttle and just seeing how the engine does with the different fuels. Again there are other ways. This was the way we decided due to several limitations with our system.

We tested the three fuels one after the other. After each test we actually purge all the lines and try to purge the lines inside the engines with nitrogen as well as. We measured engine performance based on air flow rate through the engine, the rotational speeds of the compressor and turbine and pressure and temperature along the engines such as compressor discharge, turbine inlet and turbine outlet temperature, things like that.

We also measured gaseous emissions in terms of CO, CO2, oxygen, if you want to call that an emission, and NOx and sulfur oxides. We also measured particulate matter, volatile and non-volatile, specifically soot. and we also did a quite interesting analysis of soot particles. We put the soot particles we collected on specific filters then analyzed them with a scanning electron microscope. So we could go very into the details of the particulate and try to see exactly what the particulate looks like. Such as if there are any kinds of other components on the surface of the particle. So that’s what we’re done for testing.

Ben: What was the trickiest part? I mean, what was the cleverest part of the test to set up? Because you’ve got an engine running on a stand, right? A jet engine in the lab. Okay. And then, I mean, what was the trickiest part to get right or measure?

Francesco: Yes. I would say one thing was trying to get similar humidity levels, because humidity swings quite a lot here in Texas. But also trying to collect the exhaust gases very close to the engine was tricky for material compatibility. The gases were very hot as we were trying to collect them from the engine core and not from the dilution. So, to really have whatever was coming out from the combustor. And for that, we had to kind of design a custom-made probe that we installed just outside the engine.

Ben: Okay. So what? what did you find out ? Was there any differences or anything that surprised you between the emissions of each type of fuel?

Francesco: Honestly, lots of them were expected. So in terms of engine performance, we didn’t see substantial differences between the fuels. But again, that was expected because SAF blends are designed to be dropped in, so are designed to be somewhat similar to jet fuel.

What we observed in terms of emission was that sulfur emissions were much, much smaller compared to Jet A. That was kind of expected because the sulfur in the fuel comes from oil. So it’s present in the process to get jet fuel. while that’s not the case for SAF, right? There’s no sulfur to begin with, so sulfur levels to begin with in the fuel were very limited.

Another thing we observed is that soot particles where substantially less than expected, because the aromatics content was less for the SAF. We observed different, NOx emissions. That was somewhat unexpected. We are still working on trying to understand why that was the case. But we observed substantial difference between NOx, Jet A and SAF. So that’s a very interesting result, and we are still investigating why that is the case.

Unfortunately, our system didn’t have a lot of access to the actual combustion process, because it happens inside the engine. So we are we have limited information about what is going on with the combustion itself, where the NOx is formed. So that’s why it’s taking a little longer to understand why we have these differences in NOx.

Ben: You had an e-fuel you were testing as well. Are you describing the e-fuel as SAF? And was there any differences between the fuel that you made?

Francesco: So compared to the commercially available stuff that we bought on the market, there was some small differences. But the end product is very similar. Right? It’s not like we are getting something that is jet fuel like, it is jet fuel. So we were not expecting a substantial difference.

Ben: So in terms of the composition of this fuel and the composition of the emissions and particulates that you’re getting. You’re really just seeing environmental benefits at this level.

Francesco: Correct. But I would say I want to add one thing. I think here we really have a kind of an opportunity. Right. Because right now we are trying to create SAF to be exactly like jet fuel. But we practically have full control on the composition of the fuel. So why not produce this fuel in such a way that can enhance the performance of the engine? Maybe you will end up with like less fuel consumption. So overall you get lower emissions and more efficiency. I know that this is may not possible at the moment for safety reasons. but there is an opportunity here and I think, we should look at that in the future and say, okay, maybe we should move away from trying to be exactly the same as a Jet A and try to generate a fuel that has better performance.

Ben: How might you do that?

Francesco: I mean, you can definitely control the chemical composition of your fuel, right? So you can change the performance and fuel is composed by major components such as alkanes, aromatics. I’m not a chemical engineer but I’m somewhat familiar with that. You can change the relative percentages to get better performance. However, we’re probably like several years, maybe decades away from that. But I just want to highlight that, we are looking into making something that is same as Jet A, but maybe we should look at something that is better than Jet A.

Ben: So will you be doing any follow up studies or research ?

Francesco: So yes, we will. I cannot really talk about the details, but we have follow-up studies next year, 2026. And we are also establishing a more structured program here at Southwest to keep working on stuff like this all together. The various groups that participated will maybe in the future be organizing a workshop here on site, and try to bring people from the various aspects of SAF, like production, characterization and testing on site, put them in the same room and try to come up with good results there.

Ben: So what’s the main message? The main implication? That you would say there is no real difference between these types of fuels for airplane operators?

Francesco: In terms of performance yes, there is no main differences. Right. But that’s by design, right? That’s how the SAF has been designed in past years in terms of mission. There is a difference for the environment, right? So we definitely should keep pushing them. I think I forgot to mention, we don’t have an explanation for this at the moment, but also the smell of burning stuff and burning Jet A was different. There was much less smell from burning it than burning Jet A. So that’s also a good thing for the airport, and for whoever lives around the airport.

But the message here is really, we need to keep working on stuff. We need to keep developing data sets that can be used by everybody. I’m really advocating for sharing data, because to me, that’s the only way of getting to a point that you can demonstrate that this stuff is valuable and it gives less emissions. So it’s good for everybody.

Ben: Thanks, Francesco. It’s a really interesting study, and I’m pleased we’ve been able to catch up about it. I just got a one or two final questions really about the more general landscape of the industry.

Francesco: Yeah,

Ben: There’s some tough questions that perhaps are beyond me and you answering over the next couple of minutes at least. But I just wouldn’t mind your thoughts on them if that’s okay. I mean there are some barriers to the introduction of SAF, that aren’t perhaps engineering-related. I mean, I’m talking here mainly about the cost and incentives to scale up. Do you see SAF in general for the industry as a practical way to reduce emissions? Do you think it’s a good idea that we can do?

Francesco: Yes. I think we should look at all technologies, and see which one is the most valuable.

From my experience SAF seems to be the only way right now. The other options, for example, hydrogen dibt seems to be very feasible at this stage. SAF is exactly the same as Jet A, and we know how to use Jet A. We know how to handle SAF, so it seems to be the way.

However, in my opinion, we need to create a market for SAF and the market is not really there yet. That’s one of the reasons why the price of it is very high. Even getting a new production facility is extremely expensive. If there is no market for the SAF its because we’re not creating it, then there’s no way we’re going to use it. The market can be created by incentives from the government. For example in Europe there are mandates for that. That’s one way. But without a market for SAF it’s going to stay too expensive and airlines won’t be able to afford it. If they are able to afford it, then the customer will have to pay for it. And I don’t know if people are willing to pay maybe two or three times the cost of the ticket for SAF.

Ben: So going back to what you just said about at the moment we’re trying to match as a drop in fuel. Do you think there’s real scope to make SAF even better than jet fuel? You know, that could be a way to tempt people to use it.

Francesco: Yes. That could be one way. Sure. I think that’s, that’s a good idea. However again because of the cost it probably won’t be competitive anyway. So again I think it’s good to make it. But we should make it better. But we should also think about the cost of making it.

Ben: Just finally, do you think there’s any, you mentioned some of the ASTM standards that you were working towards. And do you think do you think there’s anything different that they could do to help it?

Francesco: I know. I think it’s very difficult. Because safety is paramount. There’s nothing more important than safety for an aircraft. And that’s sticking for a very long time. So the industry has been risk averse since it was born. So I think the combination of all these things makes things go slowly, but maybe it’s a good thing they are going slowly, right? Because then we are sure that we’re going to get a product that is safe and can be used properly. But this safety also comes with this cost. So again, it’s all about balance with these factors.

Ben: But studies like yours help to increase awareness that the fuel can be used and is harmless in aircraft. And, well, it’s harmless in aircraft and with environmental benefits beyond normal jet fuel.

Francesco: Yes, correct. That’s my idea as well. Right. To just to show the benefits, to show this with real measurements, proper measurement that shows the emissions are less with the same performance. That’s one of the main goals of the project.

Ben: So will the data be freely available at some point?

Francesco: Yes. It’s going to be open source. As soon as the paper is published. We are going to also publish it on our website and all the other things. So people, will we have free access to it.

Ben: You know what? That will be not to put pressure on you.

Francesco: Yeah it’s a very large paper. So it takes time.

Ben: All right. Great. Okay. Well, Francesca, thank you again for your time and talking me through the project that you’ve just done. It’s very interesting. I’m sure our listeners or our readers will find it very interesting, too. So. Yeah. Great. Bye

Francesco: Thank you.

Ben: Bye.

“From food waste to sustainable aviation fuel: cobalt molybdenum catalysis of pretreated hydrothermal liquefaction biocrude.” Nature Communications 2025.","Trash that would otherwise rot in landfills could be converted into 62.5 billion liters of jet fuel per year, with a carbon footprint 80-90% smaller than that of fossil-based aviation fuel, according to a new study (1).

Aviation represents 2-3% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is extremely hard to decarbonize. One potential solution is sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) made from renewable feedstocks. But some of these feedstocks come with their own problems – biofuel crops can displace natural ecosystems or food crops, for example.

That has produced a surge of interest in making fuel from various forms of waste. “There is a wealth of organic waste deserving our attention,” says study team member Michael McElroy, professor of environmental studies at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “Using these wastes as feedstocks could reduce the cost of the decarbonization transition for hard-to-abate sectors.”

Municipal solid waste is a great potential feedstock because there’s already a collection system for it and it’s abundant all year round. But trash-based fuel hasn’t been the subject of much research. The new analysis is the first to use real-world data from commercial facilities involved in various production steps to calculate the potential of this approach at a global scale.

Making fuel from trash is challenging because the material is so heterogeneous. That means more steps and more energy used for manufacturing and refining the fuel. Still, the international team of U.S. and Chinese researchers calculated that globally, more than 62.5 billion liters of trash-based jet fuel could be produced each year. Incorporating it into the aviation fuel supply would reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with the industry by 16%.

The initial step of turning solid waste into a mix of gases emerged as particularly tricky. “Gasification technology remains a core technical challenge in biomass energy development,” says study team member Ming Zhao, professor of environmental engineering at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. “Its reliability and efficiency are crucial to the sustainability of green fuel synthesis, and progress on low-carbon fuels, whether methanol or Sustainable Aviation Fuel, depends on advancing this process.”

But researchers are working to improve gasification and other processes involved in making SAFs. In a separate study, researchers at the University of Illinois developed a new method for making jet fuel from food waste, which comprises the largest share of municipal solid waste in many areas (2).

It’s pretty easy to turn food waste into a high-energy liquid fuel through a process known as hydrothermal liquefaction. The problem is that this biocrude oil has a varied chemical composition, but the jet fuel needs to be uniform and extremely precise.

The researchers tested dozens of chemical catalysts for refining the biocrude and hit upon one containing the elements cobalt and molybdenum that can do the job in a single step, resulting in jet fuel that meets current industry standards.

While the result could be fine-tuned further, the researchers say it is the first food-waste-based jet fuel that could be used directly in airplanes without needing to be blended with fossil-based jet fuel.

The food-waste biocrude could also be refined into gasoline and diesel fuel, the researchers say. But while both food waste and municipal solid waste could be part of the solution to SAFs, neither is sufficient to replace conventional jet fuel completely – a sobering reminder of just how much fuel airplanes (and other fossil-based forms of transportation) burn.

Coordinated action, combined with policy certainty and investment support, is key to the success of high-cost, high-impact projects in aviation.","Europe faces a critical decade for aviation decarbonisation. Aviation remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise; unlike road transport, aircraft cannot realistically switch to electric or hydrogen propulsion at scale in the near term. That makes sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) — and the next generation of synthetic SAFs (eSAF) — the most viable path for deep emissions cuts this decade.

SAFs can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% while working seamlessly with existing aircraft and airport infrastructure. Yet despite this potential, SAFs today represent only around 2% of European jet fuel use. While the current supply is sufficient to meet demand, high production costs remain a significant barrier.

Conventional jet fuel trades currently at roughly US$600/t, compared with around US$2000 for SAF and US$7500 for eSAF. Producers need firm investment decisions now to expand capacity by 2030, but airlines remain cautious about long-term offtake agreements at these prices.

“No single fuel will dominate aviation in the decades ahead,” says Axel Vanmeulder, Renewable Fuels Expert. “Even in the most optimistic scenarios, fossil fuels remain part of the mix. But sustainable aviation fuel is by far the most viable option for the sector in the next twenty years.”

Overcoming the barriers to SAF adoption

The bottlenecks are clear and interconnected:

Feedstock limits: bio-based SAFs derived from used cooking oils, food waste, and other residues will reach their practical limits between 2030 and 2040. Beyond that, scaling eSAF production using renewable hydrogen and captured carbon will be vital. This makes early planning for synthetic fuels essential to avoid future shortages.

Price gap: SAF today costs roughly three times more than fossil jet fuel, and eSAF is currently more than 10 times as expensive, making long-term offtake agreements difficult to secure.

Investment risk: producers face multi-billion-dollar capital commitments years before revenues flow. Without credible offtake deals or policy certainty, projects remain financially unviable.

Policy instability: airlines and producers need predictable, long-term frameworks. Sudden changes in mandates or incentives can delay projects and reduce investor confidence.

Credibility: “Supply chains need watertight certification and audits,” notes Axel Vanmeulder. “If there’s any suspicion of greenwashing — like palm oil being passed off as waste oil — the entire market risks losing trust.

“The cost gap is the biggest barrier. Jet fuel today trades around US$600/t, SAF is about US$2000, and synthetic SAF is closer to US$7500. Airlines are hesitant to sign long-term offtake agreements at those levels and with these price gaps, yet without them producers can’t move forward with investment decisions.

“Feedstocks like used cooking oil and food waste can only take us so far — they’ll reach their limits by 2030 – 2040. That’s why synthetic fuels, made from renewable hydrogen and captured carbon, are already being written into future mandates.”

Regulation: driving change and creating demand

Regulation is now the sharpest lever for transformation. The European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates SAF blending, rising from 2% in 2025 to 6% by 2030¹, 20% by 2035, and 70% by 2050¹. Within this framework, a sub-mandate requires eSAF to reach 1.2% of total supply by 2030 — a critical measure for synthetic fuel growth. This sharp increase could flip today’s surplus into a shortage unless projects are financed and built in advance.

“The step-up in 2030 is significant,” Axel Vanmeulder explains. “In Europe, the SAF mandate jumps from 2% to 6% overnight. That could turn today’s oversupply into a shortage if projects aren’t built now.”

In the UK, the forthcoming SAF Mandate follows a similar trajectory, beginning at 2% in 2025 and climbing to 10% by 2030², with future rises to 22% by 2040². The UK’s alignment with Europe ensures a consistent market signal across two major aviation regions.

Globally, the CORSIA scheme (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) developed by ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation), requires airlines to offset emissions above 2019 levels³ on international flights. Though less demanding than EU rules, CORSIA establishes a global baseline, ensuring that airlines cannot ignore their emissions.

“CORSIA is a global floor — it ensures airlines can’t ignore their emissions on international flights. European mandates go further, but CORSIA makes carbon pricing and fuel transition unavoidable for every carrier worldwide.”

Beyond Europe, countries including China, Singapore, and India are developing their own SAF mandates — signalling that the transition is global and irreversible. Harmonised standards will be critical to reduce complexity and costs for airlines operating internationally.

Corporate momentum: industry taking flight

Major airlines and energy producers are already demonstrating that SAF is viable today:

Lufthansa Group is using SAF derived from used cooking oils and waste residues, achieving lifecycle emission cuts of around 80%.

JetBlue Airways has secured regular SAF supplies at key US airports, supported by corporate partners sharing the cost premium.

United Airlines has launched a dedicated investment fund to scale future SAF production.

In the UK, the RAF is deploying renewable HVO fuel across its operations4 — proof that sustainable fuels can deliver both performance and carbon reductions.

These examples show that with policy clarity, investment, and collaboration, SAF adoption is already creating tangible operational and environmental benefits.

Government and industry collaboration: lessons from fusion

Large-scale coordination between governments and industry can accelerate the deployment of breakthrough energy technologies. A prominent example outside aviation is the international nuclear fusion project, where over 20 countries are collaborating in a multi-billion-dollar experiment5 to demonstrate a proof of concept.

This demonstrates the potential for global cooperation to overcome technical and financial barriers, a model that could be applied to scaling SAF. Coordinated action, combined with policy certainty and investment support, is key to the success of high-cost, high-impact projects in aviation.

Challenges and market realities: learning from setbacks

While SAF adoption is critical, the sector faces economic and operational hurdles. Shell’s decision to cancel its Rotterdam biofuels plant provides a stark example. The facility was planned to produce up to 820 000 t of biofuels, half intended for SAF from waste cooking oils and animal fat, but after technical delays5 and market reassessments, the project was deemed “insufficiently competitive” and scrapped.

This highlights the complex interplay of cost, investment risk, and policy stability. Even technically viable projects can fail if SAF prices are too high, if airlines delay offtake agreements, or if government incentives are unclear. The consequences are significant: delayed projects reduce near-term SAF supply, potentially jeopardising Europe’s ReFuelEU 2030 targets, and signal to investors that high-capital projects require stronger policy backing.

The Shell example reinforces the need for predictable, long-term frameworks, coordinated action, and financial mechanisms like Contracts for Difference. Without these, the SAF transition risks slowing just when demand is set to increase sharply.

Policy tools to bridge the cost gap

To reach ReFuelEU’s 2030 targets, producers must begin building large-scale plants now. Yet financing remains difficult without predictable regulation or price support. Policy shifts or delayed mandates could trigger shortages just as demand accelerates.

“Contracts for Difference are one of the most effective tools available,” says Axel Vanmeulder. “They give producers confidence to build multi-billion-dollar plants today by bridging the gap between the high cost of production and what airlines are willing to pay in the future.”

Government-backed instruments like Contracts for Difference and carbon price guarantees can de-risk investment by ensuring stable revenues. Without such mechanisms, projects will struggle to reach final investment decisions — putting 2030 supply goals at risk.

Maintaining credibility and momentum

As the SAF sector scales, maintaining market integrity is essential. Rigorous certification and transparent auditing must underpin every link in the value chain to prevent reputational damage and ensure real emission reductions.

“Credibility is everything,” says Axel Vanmeulder. “If there’s any suspicion of weak certification or greenwashing, the entire market loses trust.”

Looking ahead: building an energy transition in motion

Pilot programmes are already demonstrating SAF’s technical viability, while rapid innovation in hydrogen-based and synthetic fuels is expanding future feedstock options. The transition must now move from pilot to scale.

Over the next decade, SAF will be central to global flight decarbonisation. The challenge — and opportunity — is ensuring policy, finance, and technology progress in lockstep.

CFP Energy and industry partners are calling for:

Consistent, long-term regulation that gives investors and airlines confidence.

Clear certification standards to protect market credibility.

Sustained investment incentives to bridge the cost gap.

“We need to treat this as an energy transition in motion, not one waiting to happen,” concludes Axel Vanmeulder.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has announced the introduction of a new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) levy for all departing passengers, as well as outbound cargo shipments and general and business aviation flights.

The levy is due to come into effect on flights departing Singapore from 1 October 2026 and will be payable on all air tickets or other aviation services sold from 1 April 2026.

In doing so, Singapore will become the first country worldwide to introduce this type of surcharge in the name of sustainability.

The origins of the new SAF levy

In 2024, CAAS launched the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint, which set out Singapore’s approach to the long-term, sustainable growth of Singapore’s aviation sector.

Under the Blueprint, CAAS said it intended to work with aviation stakeholders to reduce domestic aviation emissions from airport operations by 20% and achieve net-zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.

In February 2024, as part of that strategy, the CAAS unveiled its plan to introduce a new levy aimed at decarbonising airline operations. Specifically, the levy is being introduced to support the country’s goal of having 1% of all jet fuel used at the city-state’s Changi and Seletar Airports come from SAF by 2026.

This figure is planned to increase further to 3-5% by 2030, depending on “global developments and the wider availability and adoption” of SAF.

How is the levy to be calculated?

The quantum of the SAF levy is set based on the volume of SAF needed to meet the 1% SAF target for 2026 and the projected price premium of SAF over conventional jet fuel and other associated costs, including the cost of certification, blending, and delivery.

As longer passenger flights consume more fuel, the SAF levy varies based on the distance travelled. For simplicity and ease of administration, all destinations from Singapore are grouped into four geographical bands.

For flights with multiple stops, the SAF levy applicable is based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore. The bands include the following county groups –

Band 1 – Southeast Asia

Band 2 – Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, Papua New Guinea

Band 3 – Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, Middle East, Pacific Islands, New Zealand

Band 4 – Americas

The SAF Levy for passengers will be set on a per-passenger basis and varies based on the distance travelled (as classified by the four geographical bands). It will also be set according to cabin of travel, with economy and premium economy class as one group (“Economy”), while business and first class travel are also clubbed together (“Premium”).

According to CAAS, the SAF levy for the Premium cabins will be four times that for the Economy cabins or the same geographical band, for calculating the carbon emissions of passengers in different cabins of travel.

For example, the levy on a flight to a Southeast Asian destination will be S$1 in the Economy category, versus S$4 for a Premium ticket on the same route. On the longest Band 4 flight, a passenger will pay a levy amount of S$10.40 against the $41.60 paid by a Premium passenger.

Airlines have been instructed by CAAS to collect the SAF levy themselves at the point of ticket sale and must also display the SAF levy as a distinct line item on the passenger’s ticket price summary.

The CAAS notes that the SAF levy will only apply to passengers who are travelling on origin-to-destination flights and not those simply transiting through Singapore.

CAAS had previously estimated the SAF levy to be around S$3.00, S$6.00, and S$16.00 for a passenger in economy class travelling direct to Bangkok, Tokyo, and London, respectively.

The actual SAF levy amounts for Economy tickets to these same destinations are now to be charged at S$1.00, S$2.80, and S$6.40, respectively. The lower SAF Levy amounts reflect the lower prevailing cost of SAF compared to when the initial estimates were made, said the CAAS.

SAF levy for cargo shipments

It is not just passenger flights that will be affected by the new levy. Origin-destination cargo shipments are also set to be affected, with the levy being charged on a per-kilogram basis and varying based on the distance travelled, again using the four geographical bands set out above.

The aircraft operator will collect the SAF levy from the customer and must display the SAF Levy as a distinct line item on the air cargo contract. Sample rates show that the charges to be imposed vary from S$0.01 per kilogram on a Band 1 flight, through to S$0.15 per kilogram for a Band 4 flight.

Business and general aviation flights are also affected

The SAF levy for general and business aviation flights is charged on a per-aircraft basis and varies based on the distance travelled, categorised by the four geographical bands.

The amount is also calculated as a function of an aircraft’s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) official codes (A-F) for aircraft wingspan, which serve as a proxy for aircraft size.

The levies to be charged will vary from S$40 for a six-seat Cessna C404 Titan flying to a Band 1 destination to S$1,950 for a Gulfstream 6000 travelling between Singapore and a Band 4 destination.

However, the CAAS advises that certain flights, such as training flights and flights for charitable or humanitarian purposes, will not be subject to the SAF levy.

How the SAF levy will be collected

All the funds collected through the imposition of the SAF levy will go into a statutory SAF fund to be managed by CAAS. In turn, the fund will subsequently be used solely for the purchase of SAF and/or SAF environmental attributes, said CAAS, and would and to cover the associated administrative costs.

“The Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company Ltd. (SAFCo) will manage the procurement, allocation, and administration of SAF and EAs, to get the best value for money and ensure transparency and accountability in the use of the fund,” said a CAAS statement.

“CAAS will continue to engage airlines, aircraft operators, and other industry stakeholders in the coming weeks and work with them on implementation,” the statement added.

Han Kok Juan, Director-General of CAAS, said, “The introduction of the SAF Levy marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub.”

“It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost that is manageable for the air hub. We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses, and the public time to adjust.”

Passengers may not pay the whole levy

However, operating airlines may likely swallow some of the impact of the new levy being charged, to ensure that their flights from Singapore remain competitive.

Thus, although the levy may be S$10.40 on an economy flight to the US, the passenger is unlikely to bear this whole charge on their ticket price.

Instead, airlines may well adjust their base fares to keep the overall cost of tickets competitive, thereby absorbing some, if not all, of the levy. It is also worth noting that in the case of frequent flyer award tickets and other complimentary ticket types, the SAF levy will still apply and is likely to be picked up in full by the passenger, as with any other tax or surcharge.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AdobeStock_1504285675_Editorial_Use_Only-1024x683.jpeg,N,,2025-11-11 12:56:16.102513

Transport secretary Heidi Alexander told the Airlines 2025 conference in London on Monday that “the goal of SAF is to get more people in the skies, not price them out” by making air travel more sustainable.

She said the government’s Revenue Certainty Mechanism for SAF producers would “ensure more UK SAF projects get off the ground” but insisted: “It includes safeguards so that airlines pay a fair market price for fuel and passengers see little to no change in the price of a ticket.”

The government launched a consultation on proposals for the mechanism last month. However, that made clear the costs would be passed “through the supply chain and on to consumers”.

Alexander listed a series of government promises to the industry, recalling that when she addressed the Airlines UK annual dinner in February, she “made clear the government’s ironclad commitment to aviation” and said: “Judge us on what we do.”

She noted the government had given the go ahead to “airport projects from London to Yorkshire” and claimed: “A new runway at Heathrow [is] closer than ever before.”

The transport secretary suggested: “In this government you finally have a partner you can trust.”

She insisted: “I’ve not got my fingers in my ears when CEOs talk to me about the UK’s competitiveness, reducing your cost burden or smoothing the transition to greener flight.

“We’re single-minded in our desire to remove those barriers holding you back.

“We simply cannot raise living standards, remove barriers to opportunity and deliver net zero without a thriving and sustainable aviation sector.”

Alexander argued: “The demand for flight is only going in one direction. If the UK is to seize its share of a growing global aviation market, then my job is to create the conditions for you to compete, to grow and to secure a more sustainable future.”

She said: “It beggars belief that for years the issue of capacity in London and the Southeast was kicked into the long grass.

“This government could have sat on its hands while claiming this was too difficult or too politically contentious. But we weren’t prepared to let that happen.

“It’s why I gave the green light to Luton’s expansion in April, followed by Gatwick’s north runway in September, sending a clear signal this government is taking the brakes off growth. Just a few weeks ago, I announced an update on Heathrow’s expansion.”

She promised “a decision on a third runway within this parliament”, saying the government’s ambition is for “flights taking off on a new runway by 2035” and insisted: “We’ll waste no more time getting major infrastructure projects off the ground.”

Alexander noted she is currently considering two schemes for expanding Heathrow and said: “I’ll decide on a single scheme review very soon.”

She also pledged to move as fast as possible on UK airspace modernisation, insisting: “I will ensure the UK Airspace Design Service is set up before the end of the year.

When Alfanar evaluated its Lighthouse Green Fuels project it discovered the former INEOS Nitriles site in Seal Sands offered everything the initial plot lacked. The new location is only five hundred metres away but brings deeper quays, rail sidings and ample space. From feedstock pre-treatment to final fuel storage every stage will now sit within one integrated boundary. That design choice minimises truck movements and accelerates construction schedules.

Production Highlights

Phase one will process one point five million tonnes of forestry, sawmill and agricultural residues every year. The result will be more than one hundred eighty million litres of certified second generation Sustainable Aviation Fuel. When blended into airline tanks the supply offsets the carbon footprint of about four thousand five hundred transatlantic trips between London and New York. Because the plant sits close to a developing carbon capture pipeline, operators expect a two hundred percent lifecycle emissions reduction compared with conventional kerosene once sequestration begins.

Non-Obvious Insight

Locating the pretreatment units alongside the reactor provides a useful thermal advantage. Waste heat from the gasification stage can dry incoming biomass, lowering total energy demand and shielding the business model from volatile gas prices. This simple piece of engineering integration often hides in technical drawings yet delivers meaningful cost savings over decades.

Community Impact

Local leaders forecast thousands of high quality jobs in construction, operations and maintenance. Crucially, the initiative will anchor a new regional supply chain for biomass logistics, equipment fabrication and carbon management, further diversifying the Tees Valley economy.

Conclusion

By combining abundant feedstock, excellent logistics and smart process integration, Lighthouse Green Fuels is setting a new global benchmark for Sustainable Aviation Fuel deployment.

Palm Oil’s Sustainability Advantage Palm oil’s efficiency makes it difficult to overlook.","Step into the future of energy and you may find an unlikely player at the heart of it: palm oil. Once viewed largely as an agricultural commodity, palm oil is now a cornerstone of renewable energy and industrial innovation. At the center of this transformation stands Indonesia, the world’s largest palm oil producer, whose unmatched capacity is powering clean energy programs and industrial growth across Asia.

Powering the Energy Transition

Palm oil is at the center of Indonesia’s biofuel revolution. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) noted that the country produced 18.5 billion liters of biodiesel in 2023 under its B35 program, which requires a 35 percent palm component in diesel. Expansion to B40 is already in preparation, ensuring stronger integration of biofuels into the national energy mix.

The global impact is evident. S&P Global Commodity Insights projects biodiesel mandates to increase palm oil demand by nearly 10 percent in 2025. For countries like Pakistan, which spends billions annually on petroleum imports, Indonesian biodiesel represents a credible alternative to strengthen energy security and reduce dependence on volatile fuel markets.

Beyond biodiesel, palm oil is being explored as a base for advanced biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). With global airlines under pressure to cut carbon emissions, palm oil’s role in powering aviation could emerge as a critical frontier for renewable energy innovation.

Expanding Industrial Frontiers

Palm oil’s industrial applications extend well beyond fuels. Bioplastics derived from palm oil are gaining traction as countries restrict single-use plastics. Palm-based polymers are being developed into packaging, automotive parts, and medical devices, offering biodegradable alternatives to petrochemicals.

The oleochemical industry, which uses palm oil to manufacture surfactants, detergents, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals, is expected to grow at 7 percent annually until 2030, as per Grand View Research. Oleochemicals derived from palm oil are now a key raw material for renewable chemicals, enabling industries to decarbonize supply chains.

Lubricants represent another growth frontier. Research published on ResearchGate shows palm oil’s superior viscosity and biodegradability compared to mineral oils, making it a sustainable substitute for industries reliant on machinery and transport. In economies where agriculture and manufacturing dominate, palm oil–based lubricants not only lower dependence on petroleum imports but also contribute to emissions reduction targets.

Emerging applications include palm-based resins for construction, adhesives for packaging, and feedstock for hydrogenated biofuels, further proving palm oil’s versatility across industrial sectors.

Palm Oil’s Sustainability Advantage

Palm oil’s efficiency makes it difficult to overlook. Yale University’s Environmental Leadership & Training Initiative highlights that producing a tonne of palm oil requires four to ten times less land than soybean, sunflower, or rapeseed. This efficiency translates into lower resource pressure, strengthening palm oil’s positioning as a sustainable industrial input.

Indonesia has also invested heavily in climate-resilient production and replanting programs, making sustainability a competitive differentiator in global markets where buyers increasingly seek responsibly sourced materials.

Indonesia’s Volume Advantage

Indonesia dominates global supply. USDA data shows the country produced 46 million metric tonnes of crude palm oil in 2024, over 58 percent of the world’s total. This surplus enables Indonesia to meet domestic biodiesel goals while continuing to supply international markets, a flexibility its regional peers lack.

Bioenergy Times reported that Indonesia’s expanding biodiesel programs could absorb up to 12 million kiloliters of palm oil in 2025, nearly one-third of its biodiesel feedstock output. Despite rising domestic demand, Indonesia’s production scale ensures continued export availability. For major importers like Pakistan and India, this ability to balance internal demand with external commitments provides critical supply security.

Building Strategic Partnerships

Trade relationships between Indonesia and its import partners already yield significant benefits. But the real opportunity lies in extending these partnerships beyond traditional commodity trade.

South Asia’s energy resilience and industrial growth are increasingly tied to Indonesian palm oil. Future growth areas include investment in biodiesel blending facilities, the development of palm oil refinery infrastructure, and joint ventures in oleochemical and bioplastic manufacturing. Each of these sectors contributes directly to industrial modernization, green technology adoption, and employment creation, while reducing dependence on petroleum-based imports.

For Pakistan, deeper collaboration could mean moving from being solely an importer of crude palm oil to a co-investor in refining, advanced biofuel facilities, and downstream industries. Access to Indonesian expertise in processing and biodiesel technology would strengthen local capacity, while Indonesia benefits from reliable long-term demand and regional strategic alignment.

Entering Palm Oil’s Next Chapter

Palm oil is entering a new era, one where it is as central to energy and industry as it once was to agriculture. Indonesia, with unmatched scale and proactive policies, is leading this transition.

Engagement with Indonesian palm oil is about securing renewable energy options, building industrial supply chains, and fostering sustainable economic growth. As global biodiesel demand accelerates and industrial applications expand, from biofuels to bioplastics, Indonesia stands ready to provide both the volume and the reliability that partners require.

Palm oil has moved beyond raw commodity status to become tomorrow’s industrial foundation, with Indonesia at the forefront of this transformation.",https://gapki.id/en/dir-site/uploads/2025/11/palmoil_industry_sun_jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 08:56:56.729539

The Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) Foundation’s 2025 Sustainability Acceleration Challenge reveals that while more organizations are tracking and managing travel emissions, adoption of low-carbon solutions continues to lag.

The annual benchmark, developed with Accenture, gathered input from 285 corporations representing a combined business travel spend of $22 billion. The results, released during the GBTA + VDR Europe Conference in Hamburg, show a 20% increase in participation compared with 2024, signaling rising engagement. Yet the overall maturity score across companies improved only marginally—from 1.3 to 1.4 on a five-point scale—indicating slow progress in embedding sustainability within global travel programs.

Modest gains amid rising participation

The GBTA Foundation reported that smaller companies with travel budgets under $5 million have made notable strides in advancing sustainability initiatives, while larger programs exceeding $500 million in annual spend have regressed. The Financial, Banking and Insurance sector leads with a maturity score of 1.9, followed by Professional Services and Consulting at 1.7. These industries account for a significant portion of emissions tied to business travel.

Areas showing the most improvement include Sustainable Travel Policies, which rose from a 1.8 to 2.2 score, and Carbon Budgets, up from 0.5 to 0.7. Reporting and target-setting have also become more standard practice, with more firms integrating these mechanisms into their travel programs. However, tools that directly shape travel decisions—such as carbon fees or online booking tool (OBT) features designed to encourage greener choices—have shown little to no progress.

“Year two of our benchmark shows real engagement and growing commitment. But despite progress, greater urgency is needed,” said Delphine Millot, Senior Vice President, Advocacy and Sustainability, GBTA, and Managing Director, GBTA Foundation. “To future-proof business travel, companies must accelerate adoption of sustainable procurement practices and carbon management strategies to send a real signal to the market.”

Where companies are falling short

Despite growing awareness, the benchmark highlights three critical areas that require acceleration: influencing travel behavior, unifying demand for sustainable suppliers, and investing in emissions abatement technologies. Supplier sustainability assessments have increased, but more advanced measures—such as adopting GBTA Sustainable Procurement Standards or embedding sustainability clauses in contracts—remain static at a score of 1.2. Limited guidance and technology gaps continue to slow progress.

Investment in Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) has grown modestly, with 15% of corporations purchasing SAF certificates in 2025, up from 12% last year. While this trend points to increased interest, adoption remains far from mainstream. GBTA encourages firms to use its SAF Corporate Connect program to support implementation and share best practices across the sector.

“The GBTA Sustainability Acceleration Challenge provides a roadmap for the future,” said Dr. Jesko-Philipp Neuenburg, Global Travel & Aviation Sustainability Lead, Accenture. “With more companies participating, we’re seeing where the industry is moving forward, and where further collaboration can close the gap between ambition and action.”

According to GBTA, regional performance varied. Global and Asia-Pacific travel programs recorded slight improvements, while European and North American firms saw marginal declines, reflecting the influence of regulatory and economic uncertainty on travel policy advancement.

Recognizing leaders and innovators

To highlight progress, GBTA introduced the inaugural Acceleration Awards and Leaderboards recognizing companies that demonstrate leadership and measurable improvement in travel decarbonization. Winners include Kearney, BDO LLP, Parexel, University of California, IKEA, and Nokia across various global, regional, and industry categories. BDO LLP was named Europe’s Regional Leader for its sustainability-driven travel initiatives.

“BDO LLP are participating in the Acceleration Challenge to showcase our leadership in sustainable travel,” said Verity Phillips-Davies, Travel Manager at BDO LLP. “By innovating and advocating for impactful solutions, we aim to inspire industry-wide change and demonstrate how strategic engagement can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of business travel.”

Millot added: “These companies exemplify the leadership, innovation, and collaboration needed to transform business travel for a net-zero future. Their commitment to measurable progress shows what’s possible when sustainability becomes an integral part of corporate travel strategy.”

The GBTA Foundation continues to expand resources to help organizations transition from awareness to implementation through its Sustainable Business Travel Transition Pathway and new training on Sustainable Procurement Standards.

(NASDAQ: GEVO), a pioneer in bio-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), is positioning itself at the forefront of this transition with its ATJ-30 jet fuel project. The company's third-quarter 2025 financial results and strategic roadmap suggest a clear-eyed focus on leveraging its Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology to capture a significant share of the rapidly expanding SAF market. With a projected $150 million in Adjusted EBITDA once operational, the ATJ-30 project represents both a financial milestone and a strategic bet on the future of low-carbon aviation.

Strategic Momentum in Sustainable Aviation Fuels

Gevo's ATJ-30 project is a cornerstone of its long-term strategy to capitalize on the surging demand for SAF. The U.S. bio-based SAF market is projected to grow from $420.04 million in 2024 to $4.77 billion by 2032, driven by airline commitments to carbon neutrality and regulatory tailwinds, according to a

. Over 90% of airlines now aim for at least 2% SAF use by 2025, creating a structural tailwind for producers like Gevo, according to the same OpenPR report.

The company's ATJ technology, which converts ethanol into renewable jet fuel, is uniquely positioned to benefit from this trend. By leveraging its existing ethanol production infrastructure and corn supply chains, Gevo aims to achieve cost advantages over competitors. CEO Dr. Patrick Gruber emphasized that the ATJ-30 project, pending a Final Investment Decision (FID) by mid-2026, could add $150 million in Adjusted EBITDA once operational, as reported by

. This figure assumes robust demand from airlines and governments seeking to meet decarbonization targets, as well as successful integration of Gevo's production network, as noted in the same StockTitan report.

Carbon Credit Monetization: A Dual Revenue Stream

Gevo's financial flexibility is further bolstered by its aggressive monetization of carbon credits. In Q3 2025, the company generated $52 million from Clean Fuel Production Credits (CFPCs) under the 45Z tax credit program, as reported by

. Additionally, a multi-year Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) offtake agreement is expected to yield $26 million over five years, according to the same Finimize report. These non-operational revenue streams are critical for funding capital expenditures and reducing reliance on volatile commodity markets.

The strategic value of carbon credits extends beyond immediate cash flow. By converting emissions reductions into tradable assets, Gevo aligns its business model with global sustainability frameworks. This approach not only enhances profitability but also strengthens its appeal to institutional investors prioritizing ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria. As the U.S. government introduces new incentives for bio-based SAF adoption, Gevo's ability to scale carbon credit monetization could become a key differentiator in a competitive market, according to the OpenPR report.

Path to $150M Adjusted EBITDA: Risks and Realities

While the $150 million EBITDA target is ambitious, several factors could accelerate or hinder its realization. On the positive side, Gevo's Q3 2025 results demonstrated operational resilience, with $6.7 million in Adjusted EBITDA and $108.4 million in cash reserves, as reported by StockTitan. The company's focus on cost reduction and carbon co-products is also improving its balance sheet, according to Finimize. However, challenges remain.

First, the ATJ-30 project's success hinges on securing the FID by mid-2026 and obtaining a DOE loan guarantee extension, as Finimize noted. Delays in regulatory approvals or capital constraints could derail timelines. Second, the SAF market, while growing, is still nascent. Gevo must navigate pricing pressures and competition from emerging players like LanzaJet and SkyNRG, as reported in the OpenPR report. Finally, the conversion of carbon credits into cash depends on stable policy environments and market demand for carbon offsets-a variable that could shift with political cycles.

Conclusion: A High-Stakes Bet on the Future of Aviation

Gevo's ATJ-30 project encapsulates the dual forces of innovation and risk in the renewable energy sector. By targeting $150 million in Adjusted EBITDA, the company is betting on its ability to scale production, secure strategic partnerships, and monetize carbon assets in a market poised for explosive growth. While execution risks are significant, the alignment of industry trends, regulatory support, and Gevo's technological expertise suggests that this target is not merely aspirational-it is a calculated gamble on the future of sustainable aviation.

For investors, the key question is whether Gevo can maintain its strategic momentum while navigating the complexities of capital-intensive expansion. If the company succeeds, the rewards could be transformative-not just for its bottom line, but for the broader transition to a low-carbon economy.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-qwen_generated_1762829608080.jpg.png,N,,2025-11-11 08:57:11.945854

Construction of the plant, dubbed “Project Beacon”, will commence in 2026. It will begin commercial operations in 2028. The plant will be located at Aster’s refining hub on Pulau Bukom, which it took over from Shell in April.

The move comes amid a deal spree by Aster – a joint venture between Indonesia’s Chandra Asri and commodities trader Glencore.

Besides the Bukom refinery, the company also recently purchased Singapore’s Esso petrol stations and the Jurong Island assets of Shell and Chevron Phillips Singapore Chemicals.

Aster chief financial officer Andre Khor said that the sustainable aviation fuel plant is aligned with the deep-tech focus of its unit, Aster Ventures.

“The thesis driving up the investment is that… we are looking at deep tech to help address core industrial (needs), as well as next-generation energy solutions that are adjacent and synergistic with our energy, chemicals and infrastructure assets on the ground,” he said.

Khor was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the deal signing, held at Temasek Shophouse on Tuesday (Nov 11).

Project Beacon will use Aether’s proprietary technology to convert industrial waste gas, as well as biomethane, into sustainable aviation fuel.

This is a first for the region. Incumbent producers of this fuel, such as Neste, typically tap used cooking oil to produce it.

Aster will provide Aether with the waste carbon feedstock for fuel production, as well as renewable power, utilities and site support.

The output will be certified by the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, a global initiative to decarbonise the aviation sector.

“Tonnes of interest”

Project Beacon will produce up to 50 barrels of fuel a day, or 2,000 tonnes a year. This comprises 1,600 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel and 400 tonnes of sustainable naphtha.

There will also be 24 full-time jobs created for the operation of the plant, said Aether’s founder and chief executive Conor Madigan. The startup separately plans to grow its Singapore headcount to 30, from two at present.

Based in Singapore and Chicago, Aether was incubated and funded in 2022 by Xora, a deep-tech venture firm backed by Temasek.

Speaking to The Business Times at Tuesday’s event, Madigan noted that there is a shortage of used cooking oil to produce sustainable aviation fuel.

Aether aims to overcome this problem through its technology, which allows the fuel to be made from waste gases and other forms of waste carbon. With Project Beacon, the input will be gases from Aster’s refining processes.

“(That) allows us to get the feedstock we need in a super-steady stream and consistent flow… And so it really makes this project super simple. We have a rock solid feedstock supply, and it allows us to demonstrate a route to making fuels that we think is quite scalable,” he said.

In February, Singapore Airlines signed an agreement with Aether to potentially source sustainable aviation fuel from the startup.

Asked if the carrier will purchase the fuel from Project Beacon, Madigan would only say: “It is our intention that the offtake for this plant will be to a major airline. We hope to provide updates on that down the line.”

He also noted that there is “tonnes of interest throughout Asia” for offtake, especially as more governments mandate the use of the fuel.

Singapore, for instance, aims for sustainable aviation fuel to account for 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, rising to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.

The Republic has set up a central buyer for sustainable aviation fuel, while also introducing a levy for the fuel ranging from S$1 to S$41.60 per airline ticket.

Aether was “really impressed here in Singapore by the policy support for sustainability and the sort of steadiness of the government’s approach, which is a contrast right now (to the) world in general”, said Madigan.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/ce55d785b9b48e50ae56872316ee7ae99a6f36d791bc126e4690fea214c4fd9f?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-11-11 05:56:29.151981

Gevo topped revenue forecasts with $42.71 million in the third quarter of 2025, notching its second straight period of positive adjusted EBITDA and ramping up future plans through a fresh carbon credit agreement and expansion into green jet fuel.

What does this mean?

Gevo, the biofuels firm, logged sales that beat analyst expectations by over $3 million, with steady operations at its North Dakota and renewable natural gas facilities helping deliver another positive adjusted EBITDA. The company’s recent multi-year carbon credit deal will add $26 million over five years, boosting its efforts to diversify income and reinforce balance sheet strength. Selling its Agri-Energy subsidiary trimmed annual costs by $3 million, keeping things leaner. While Gevo still reported a net loss of $7.58 million and operating costs at $46.4 million, its roadmap to profitability looks clearer as it eyes a mid-2026 decision on a new alcohol-to-jet fuel plant and aims to hit $100 million in adjusted EBITDA by scaling up carbon co-products and trimming expenses.

Why should I care?

For markets: Positive signals fuel sector momentum.

Gevo’s stronger-than-expected numbers and upbeat analyst sentiment set it apart from much of the renewable fuels sector, where many companies are still rated 'hold.' The stock’s median 12-month price target sits at $2.63—a solid premium to recent trading levels—reflecting faith in Gevo’s diversification, tight cost controls, and push into sustainable aviation fuels as airlines step up their climate goals.

The bigger picture: Green fuel ambitions grow as industry evolves.

With major airlines and governments seeking more sustainable aviation fuel, innovations like Gevo’s alcohol-to-jet technology are quickly gaining steam.

Taking science-based action both reduces emissions and manages transition risks, maintaining competitiveness and offering growth opportunities in a carbon-constrained world.”","The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) announced the release of its updated draft Corporate Net-Zero Standard V2, its planned update to its key standard to assess, certify and track companies’ decarbonization commitments to achieve net zero emissions and to support science-based climate target setting.

According to the SBTi, the new draft aims to enable more companies to set net zero goals by “making science-based climate action more accessible and actionable,” while simultaneously balancing the need to maintain alignment with global climate goals. Among the key changes introduced in the new draft is “a menu of options for companies to drive down their carbon footprint,” according to SBTi CEO David Kennedy, including multiple pathways allowed for target setting for direct emissions reductions, and clearer rules for the use of instruments such as carbon credits to reach decarbonization goals.

The SBTi was founded in 2015 with the goal to establish science-based environmental target setting as a standard corporate practice. The organizations’ key functions include defining and promoting best practice in emissions reductions and net-zero targets in line with climate science, providing technical assistance to companies who set science-based targets, and providing companies with independent assessment and validation of their emissions reduction targets. To date, nearly 12,000 companies have set science-based emissions reduction targets with the SBTi, or made commitments to do so.

The organization’s flagship first Corporate Net-Zero Standard was published in 2021, and the SBTi announced plans early last year to update the standard.

In March 2025, the SBTi released its initial draft of the new V2 standard, and launched a consultation into a series of the changes introduced, including proposals to add allow multiple methods for reaching emissions targets, require explicit Scope 2 (purchased energy) emissions targets, require large companies to set Scope 3 value chain emissions goals. The initial draft also included a consultation on options to address residual emissions on the pathway to net zero, including the introduction of interim carbon removal targets, as well as formally recognizing companies which are investing in Beyond Value Chain Mitigation (BVCM).

Following feedback from the first draft’s public consultation and expert working groups, the SBTi’s new draft further develops and refines the proposals, including an update to the key ambition for companies, changing from “Companies shall publicly commit to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050,” to “Companies shall set an ambition to transition their operations and value chains to align with the goal to be net-zero by no later than 2050,” with the SBTi noting that the new language avoids confusion from the word “commitment,” focusing instead on “the company’s overarching intention to reach net-zero by 2050.”

For direct operations Scope 1 emissions, the new draft introduces 3 approaches for target setting – including reducing emissions on a linear pathway to net-zero, increasing the share of low-carbon activities over time, and implementing Asset Decarbonization Plans to decarbonize assets based on technological readiness. The draft also adds some flexibility and clarity to Scope 2 target setting requirements, including maintaining requirements for all companies to set near-term targets, but making long-term targets optional for smaller companies, specifying criteria for near-term targets, adding mechanisms for limited amounts of electricity, heat, steam and cooling to be excluded from the near-term targets, and improved criteria for purchasing low carbon electricity.

The proposed updated standard’s Scope 3 approach focuses on addressing priority emissions sources that can have the greatest impact, while allowing flexibility, with the SBTi noting that value chain emissions have formed one of the most significant barriers to companies’ setting of science-based targets. The new draft increases focus from the initial draft on targeting the highest-priority emissions in the near-term while exclusions for lower-impact activities and areas where influence is limited, while also introducing three options for Scope 3 target setting – including “emissions intensity,” “activity alignment,” and “counterparty alignment” – noting that the options “reflect the diversity of value chain emissions and the different mitigation strategies companies use across their value chains.”

One of the key changes in the new draft is the formalization of the integration of the use of environmental attribute certificates (EACs), such as carbon credits or energy and commodity certificates, while including strict conditions. For example, Scope 2 targets can include matching using low-carbon electricity EACs that are purchased in the same region as the company’s electricity consumption, while Scope 3 targets may use EACs on a limited basis where direct supplier engagement or physical traceability is not feasible.

The SBTi’s new draft standard also adds a new recognition mechanism aimed at incentivizing companies by highlighting early, voluntary action to address ongoing emissions, introducing a “leadership” category, which includes large companies addressing 100% of their ongoing scope 1-3 emissions, or smaller companies addressing 100% of Scope 1 and 2 emissions.

Additionally, the new draft also includes new requirements for large companies (or Category A companies, which include large companies in all countries and medium-sized companies in high-income countries), including a requirement for the publication of credible transition plans within 12 months of target validation, as well as to address an increasing portion of ongoing emissions, or those not yet reduced on the pathway towards net zero by 2050, from 2035 through a portfolio of carbon removals.

Coordinated action, combined with policy certainty and investment support, is key to the success of high-cost, high-impact projects in aviation.","Europe faces a critical decade for aviation decarbonisation. Aviation remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise; unlike road transport, aircraft cannot realistically switch to electric or hydrogen propulsion at scale in the near term. That makes sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) — and the next generation of synthetic SAFs (eSAF) — the most viable path for deep emissions cuts this decade.

SAFs can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% while working seamlessly with existing aircraft and airport infrastructure. Yet despite this potential, SAFs today represent only around 2% of European jet fuel use. While the current supply is sufficient to meet demand, high production costs remain a significant barrier.

Conventional jet fuel trades currently at roughly US$600/t, compared with around US$2000 for SAF and US$7500 for eSAF. Producers need firm investment decisions now to expand capacity by 2030, but airlines remain cautious about long-term offtake agreements at these prices.

“No single fuel will dominate aviation in the decades ahead,” says Axel Vanmeulder, Renewable Fuels Expert. “Even in the most optimistic scenarios, fossil fuels remain part of the mix. But sustainable aviation fuel is by far the most viable option for the sector in the next twenty years.”

Overcoming the barriers to SAF adoption

The bottlenecks are clear and interconnected:

Feedstock limits: bio-based SAFs derived from used cooking oils, food waste, and other residues will reach their practical limits between 2030 and 2040. Beyond that, scaling eSAF production using renewable hydrogen and captured carbon will be vital. This makes early planning for synthetic fuels essential to avoid future shortages.

Price gap: SAF today costs roughly three times more than fossil jet fuel, and eSAF is currently more than 10 times as expensive, making long-term offtake agreements difficult to secure.

Investment risk: producers face multi-billion-dollar capital commitments years before revenues flow. Without credible offtake deals or policy certainty, projects remain financially unviable.

Policy instability: airlines and producers need predictable, long-term frameworks. Sudden changes in mandates or incentives can delay projects and reduce investor confidence.

Credibility: “Supply chains need watertight certification and audits,” notes Axel Vanmeulder. “If there’s any suspicion of greenwashing — like palm oil being passed off as waste oil — the entire market risks losing trust.

“The cost gap is the biggest barrier. Jet fuel today trades around US$600/t, SAF is about US$2000, and synthetic SAF is closer to US$7500. Airlines are hesitant to sign long-term offtake agreements at those levels and with these price gaps, yet without them producers can’t move forward with investment decisions.

“Feedstocks like used cooking oil and food waste can only take us so far — they’ll reach their limits by 2030 – 2040. That’s why synthetic fuels, made from renewable hydrogen and captured carbon, are already being written into future mandates.”

Regulation: driving change and creating demand

Regulation is now the sharpest lever for transformation. The European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates SAF blending, rising from 2% in 2025 to 6% by 2030¹, 20% by 2035, and 70% by 2050¹. Within this framework, a sub-mandate requires eSAF to reach 1.2% of total supply by 2030 — a critical measure for synthetic fuel growth. This sharp increase could flip today’s surplus into a shortage unless projects are financed and built in advance.

“The step-up in 2030 is significant,” Axel Vanmeulder explains. “In Europe, the SAF mandate jumps from 2% to 6% overnight. That could turn today’s oversupply into a shortage if projects aren’t built now.”

In the UK, the forthcoming SAF Mandate follows a similar trajectory, beginning at 2% in 2025 and climbing to 10% by 2030², with future rises to 22% by 2040². The UK’s alignment with Europe ensures a consistent market signal across two major aviation regions.

Globally, the CORSIA scheme (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) developed by ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation), requires airlines to offset emissions above 2019 levels³ on international flights. Though less demanding than EU rules, CORSIA establishes a global baseline, ensuring that airlines cannot ignore their emissions.

“CORSIA is a global floor — it ensures airlines can’t ignore their emissions on international flights. European mandates go further, but CORSIA makes carbon pricing and fuel transition unavoidable for every carrier worldwide.”

Beyond Europe, countries including China, Singapore, and India are developing their own SAF mandates — signalling that the transition is global and irreversible. Harmonised standards will be critical to reduce complexity and costs for airlines operating internationally.

Corporate momentum: industry taking flight

Major airlines and energy producers are already demonstrating that SAF is viable today:

Lufthansa Group is using SAF derived from used cooking oils and waste residues, achieving lifecycle emission cuts of around 80%.

JetBlue Airways has secured regular SAF supplies at key US airports, supported by corporate partners sharing the cost premium.

United Airlines has launched a dedicated investment fund to scale future SAF production.

In the UK, the RAF is deploying renewable HVO fuel across its operations4 — proof that sustainable fuels can deliver both performance and carbon reductions.

These examples show that with policy clarity, investment, and collaboration, SAF adoption is already creating tangible operational and environmental benefits.

Government and industry collaboration: lessons from fusion

Large-scale coordination between governments and industry can accelerate the deployment of breakthrough energy technologies. A prominent example outside aviation is the international nuclear fusion project, where over 20 countries are collaborating in a multi-billion-dollar experiment5 to demonstrate a proof of concept.

This demonstrates the potential for global cooperation to overcome technical and financial barriers, a model that could be applied to scaling SAF. Coordinated action, combined with policy certainty and investment support, is key to the success of high-cost, high-impact projects in aviation.

Challenges and market realities: learning from setbacks

While SAF adoption is critical, the sector faces economic and operational hurdles. Shell’s decision to cancel its Rotterdam biofuels plant provides a stark example. The facility was planned to produce up to 820 000 t of biofuels, half intended for SAF from waste cooking oils and animal fat, but after technical delays5 and market reassessments, the project was deemed “insufficiently competitive” and scrapped.

This highlights the complex interplay of cost, investment risk, and policy stability. Even technically viable projects can fail if SAF prices are too high, if airlines delay offtake agreements, or if government incentives are unclear. The consequences are significant: delayed projects reduce near-term SAF supply, potentially jeopardising Europe’s ReFuelEU 2030 targets, and signal to investors that high-capital projects require stronger policy backing.

The Shell example reinforces the need for predictable, long-term frameworks, coordinated action, and financial mechanisms like Contracts for Difference. Without these, the SAF transition risks slowing just when demand is set to increase sharply.

Policy tools to bridge the cost gap

To reach ReFuelEU’s 2030 targets, producers must begin building large-scale plants now. Yet financing remains difficult without predictable regulation or price support. Policy shifts or delayed mandates could trigger shortages just as demand accelerates.

“Contracts for Difference are one of the most effective tools available,” says Axel Vanmeulder. “They give producers confidence to build multi-billion-dollar plants today by bridging the gap between the high cost of production and what airlines are willing to pay in the future.”

Government-backed instruments like Contracts for Difference and carbon price guarantees can de-risk investment by ensuring stable revenues. Without such mechanisms, projects will struggle to reach final investment decisions — putting 2030 supply goals at risk.

Maintaining credibility and momentum

As the SAF sector scales, maintaining market integrity is essential. Rigorous certification and transparent auditing must underpin every link in the value chain to prevent reputational damage and ensure real emission reductions.

“Credibility is everything,” says Axel Vanmeulder. “If there’s any suspicion of weak certification or greenwashing, the entire market loses trust.”

Looking ahead: building an energy transition in motion

Pilot programmes are already demonstrating SAF’s technical viability, while rapid innovation in hydrogen-based and synthetic fuels is expanding future feedstock options. The transition must now move from pilot to scale.

Over the next decade, SAF will be central to global flight decarbonisation. The challenge — and opportunity — is ensuring policy, finance, and technology progress in lockstep.

CFP Energy and industry partners are calling for:

Consistent, long-term regulation that gives investors and airlines confidence.

Clear certification standards to protect market credibility.

Sustained investment incentives to bridge the cost gap.

“We need to treat this as an energy transition in motion, not one waiting to happen,” concludes Axel Vanmeulder.

A Gulfstream G650 flying to London, for example, would be charged a levy of S$1,200.
We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.”","Singapore’s Ministry of Transport’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAAS) announced that it will be implementing a new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy for travelers and cargo on all departing flights, starting in April 2026.

Fees will range from S$1.00 (USD$0.77) for an economy-class passenger on a short-range flight to S$41.60 (USD$31.95) for a business-class passenger on a Americas-bound flight.

The new SAF levy follows the launch by CAAS in February 2024 of the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint, outlining a series of key actions aimed at decarbonizing Singapore’s aviation sector with goals to reduce domestic aviation emissions from airport operations by 20% by 2030, and to achieve net zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050. The blueprint included a requirement for all departing flights from Singapore to use SAF, beginning at 1% from 2026, and expected to increase in following years.

When it launched the blueprint, CAAS said that use of SAF is anticipated to contribute nearly two thirds of the emissions reductions required for the sector to reach net zero by 2050.

The introduction of the levy forms part of the blueprint’s initiatives aimed at building an SAF ecosystem. The levy is based on the distance travelled by the flight, and the volume of SAF needed to meet the 1% SAF target for 2026 and the projected price premium of SAF over conventional jet fuel and other associated costs, including the cost of certification, blending, and delivery

While CAAS had originally estimated the levy for economy class passengers to be S$3.00, S$6.00, and S$16.00 for flights to Bangkok, Tokyo and London, respectively, the actual fee to be charged will be substantially lower – at S$1.00, S$2.80, and S$6.40 to each destination, respectively – due to the lower cost of SAF since the estimates were released early last year.

The new system will also introduce levies on cargo on a per-kilogram basis, also based on distance travelled, as well as on business aviation flights on a per aircraft basis, based on aircraft type and distance travelled. A Gulfstream G650 flying to London, for example, would be charged a levy of S$1,200.

According to CAAS, the levies collected will go into a statutory SAF Fund, which will be used solely for the purchase of SAF and SAF environmental attributes, and to cover related administration costs.

CAAS General Director Mr Han Kok Juan said:

“The introduction of the SAF Levy marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub. It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub. We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Airport-Singapore2.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 05:56:39.496342

Singapore will soon introduce a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) levy of up to S$41.60 (around $31.95 or Rs 3,690) per passenger beginning next year, marking a significant step in its efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the aviation sector. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced that the levy will apply to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights departing from October 1, 2026. Passengers transiting through Singapore will be exempt from the charge. Under the new system, the amount of levy will vary depending on travel class and route distance. Economy and premium economy travellers will pay S$1 for short-haul trips within Southeast Asia and S$10.40 for flights to the Americas. Business and first-class passengers will be charged four times that amount, reported Bloomberg. Cargo flights will also face a separate fee, calculated by weight. The funds raised through this levy will support the centralised purchase of sustainable aviation fuel — typically produced from waste oils or agricultural feedstock — as part of Singapore’s plan to achieve an SAF adoption rate of 3–5% by 2030. According to CAAS, a drop in SAF costs has allowed the levy to remain lower than earlier projections, which had estimated rates between S$3 and S$16. Singapore becomes the first country in the world to impose a passenger-based green fuel tax — a move especially notable given its position as a major global aviation hub. Changi Airport is on track for a record year, with passenger traffic expected to surpass its pre-pandemic peak of 68.3 million in 2019. Although aviation contributes only around 1.2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, as per the European Commission cited by Bloomberg, the industry continues to face significant challenges in cutting emissions due to limited SAF availability and high production costs. The International Air Transport Association noted that while global SAF production doubled last year, it still accounted for just 0.3% of total jet fuel volumes. Singapore’s announcement coincides with the COP30 climate summit in Brazil, where nearly 200 countries are discussing measures to strengthen global climate action.

The Green Route inaugural flight took place on Thursday, 6th November, at Suvarnabhumi Airport in the presence of key representatives from both the public and private sectors.

Attendees included Vietnamese ambassador to Thailand Pham Viet Hung, Ambassador of Vietnam to Thailand; Panya Chupanit, director-general of the Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning, Ministry of Transport; and Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand director-general Manat Chavanaprayoon among others.

TAT governor Thapanee Kiatphaibool remarked at the event: “TAT commends VietJet Thailand for its leadership in integrating sustainability into commercial aviation. This milestone demonstrates how the aviation sector can play a pivotal role in promoting responsible travel and supporting Thailand’s national target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. It is a meaningful step towards building a low-carbon society and strengthening Thailand’s position as a regional leader in sustainable tourism.”

This maiden flight makes Vietjet Thailand the country’s first low-cost carrier service on this route powered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

This initiative also underscores Thailand’s commitment to sustainable tourism and supports the aviation industry’s transition towards cleaner, low-carbon operations across ASEAN.

Putting the sustainable tourism agenda forward

Kiatphaibool added that TAT continues to advance sustainable tourism through initiatives such as the Thailand Tourism Awards, CF-Hotels, Sustainable Tourism Acceleration Rating (STAR), and the Krabi Prototype project.

These programmes guide tourism operators towards greener practices and reinforce TAT’s mission to position Thailand as a trusted, value-driven destination for responsible travellers.

The Green Route collaboration between VietJet, and PTT OR exemplifies how cross-sector partnerships can drive sustainable mobility and enhance Thailand’s reputation as a leader in sustainable travel and low-carbon tourism.

Integrating sustainability into commercial aviation

Under its Fly Green programme which aligns with the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, VietJet Thailand became the country’s first low-cost carrier to use SAF on commercial routes.

The Bangkok–Phu Quoc-Bangkok service marks the airline’s second Green Route, following the Bangkok–Da Nang debut in 2024.

Developed in partnership with PTT OR and Bangkok Aviation Fuel Services (BAFS), the initiative reflects VietJet’s long-term strategy to reduce emissions and achieve a five-percent SAF blend across all flights by 2030.

Each SAF-powered flight can cut approximately 250 kilograms of CO₂ and reduce up to 80 percent of total emissions, contributing to the airline’s target of lowering more than 153,000 tonnes of CO₂ within six years.

According to Vietjet Thailand CEO Woranate Laprabang, the airline’s integration of SAF into its regular operations reflects its commitment to balancing business growth with environmental responsibility, while empowering passengers to contribute to reducing carbon emissions through their travel choices.

He added that this collaboration demonstrates how synergy between the aviation and energy sectors can accelerate the transition towards a greener and more sustainable future for the industry.

Produced from renewable and waste-based materials such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and biogas, SAF meets ASTM D7566 international standards and performs identically to conventional Jet A-1 fuel without compromising safety or efficiency.

Thailand has strong potential for SAF production due to its abundant bio-based resources and growing circular economy infrastructure.

Strengthened public–private collaboration will be crucial to scaling production, improving cost efficiency, and supporting both national and regional carbon-reduction goals.

Vietnam remains one of Thailand’s most important short-haul markets, with over 600,000 Vietnamese visitors expected in 2025. Vietnamese travellers continue to favour Thailand for its leisure, wellness, and cultural offerings while exploring new destinations.

Shaping new agreements and solutions to accelerate ZEV and infrastructure deployment, including 26,000+ heavy, medium and light electric vehicles and approximately 200 MW of renewable energy capacity in India, Mexico, and Brazil;

Driving the business case for electrification use cases and supporting policy and standards integration in Europe;

Co-design future mobility solutions with cities to ensure half of the world population has access to sustainable and people-centered and affordable solutions;

Securing coherent policy frameworks, harmonized standards, and effective market-based mechanisms to accelerate transport decarbonization across modes, including the adoption of alternative fuels required in the maritime and aviation sectors.

Decarbonization is within reach, and businesses are showing the pathway

Transport is responsible for ~ 23 % of global energy‑related CO₂ emissions, making it one of the largest and fastest‑growing drivers of climate change. To align with the Paris Agreement, the sector must cut emissions by approximately 25 % by 2030.

Despite historical increases in global energy transition investments last year, led in great part by transport electrification, BloombergNEF highlights these must accelerate as they currently only represent 37% of what is required to get on track with the Net Zero Scenario.

To make this transition a reality, we need to address several use cases across transport modes and shape solutions that address specific market needs, while ensuring a just transition and protecting natural ecosystems.

This means deploying zero-emission vehicles supported by appropriate charging infrastructure, smart and flexible grids and digitalization to achieve seamless integration and operational efficiencies. Complementing electrification, Alternative Fuels like Hydrogen, Biofuels, and RNG are crucial to fill gaps where electrification falls short and ensure decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors like shipping and aviation. This multi-use case and multi-technology landscape presents decarbonization challenges such as integration, fragmented planning and uncertain investments.

The good news is that the technologies are available, and businesses have been backing the transition with significant investments, showing that the transition is feasible and full of opportunities.

Clean transport remains one of the fastest growing areas of investment in the energy transition as EV adoption surges, more infrastructure is built, and shipping and aviation activity picks up.

– Colin McKerracher, Head of Clean Transport at BloombergNEF

According to WBCSD’s Business Breakthrough Barometer 2025, 91 % of business leaders say they have maintained or increased investments toward net-zero over the past year. This demonstrates both commitment and confidence in the available decarbonization technologies and digital solutions.

Governments and companies must collaborate across regions to bridge implementation and investment gaps

While global investment in electrified transport reached USD $757.4 billion in 2024 and the driving force behind growth in the global energy transition, investments are still insufficient to meet the scale and pace required for global transport decarbonization. The transport landscape remains fragmented and unpredictable, hampering scaled adoption and threatening global decarbonization goals.

Companies working towards decarbonization often face systemic challenges that slow down their progress. These include unclear transition roadmaps and varying market maturities, supply and demand gaps, diverse transportation and mobility needs, lack of integration in multi-fuel landscapes, and knowledge gaps.

Bridging these gaps requires collective action across the transport and mobility value chains and across regions, including:

Clarifying technology breakthroughs that can rapidly scale and benefit climate, people, and nature, and strengthening the business case for their adoption by unlocking operational efficiencies and addressing risks.

Removing roadblocks and aligning on standards and mechanisms that promote capital flow into clean transport.

Driving regional action to foster ecosystem collaboration and enable tailored solutions design.

The road to sustainable mobility is about building better infrastructure, stronger partnerships, and a shared vision for the future of movement. At Toyota, we believe innovation thrives when businesses, governments, and communities work together to create mobility systems that are inclusive, efficient, and carbon neutral. Our goal is to help every journey contribute to a more sustainable world.

Brazil partnership

As part of the Brazil country partnership, established at COP29, companies seek opportunities to scale investments in transport decarbonization. At COP30, in partnership with CALSTART, Smart Freight Centre, ICCT, WRI Brasil, Scania, Amazon and C40, they are announcing the e-Dutra coalition to transform Brazil’s mobility future.

The initiative has begun deploying electric trucks and chargers along the Rio de Janeiro–São Paulo corridor, with the intention to reach 1,000 trucks operating daily by 2030. By integrating lessons learned about vehicle performance, route optimization, and the practical requirements for large-scale commercial charging networks, e-Dutra is set to accelerate the rollout of reliable, high-capacity charging stations. Additionally, by aggregating large-scale commitments from shippers and logistics providers, the coalition creates a predictable demand signal which de-risks investments in charging infrastructure.

With our Brazilian brand Volkswagen Truck & Bus as a co-leader of the e-Dutra Coalition, TRATON is proud to work alongside our partners to transform Brazil’s road freight into a zero-emission future. By deploying electric trucks and developing the charging infrastructure along the Rio de Janeiro–São Paulo corridor, we are creating a scalable model that will accelerate the adoption of sustainable transport across the country.

– Andreas Follér, Chief Sustainability Officer, TRATON Group

As the battery revolution continues to unfold, electrifying road freight transport is a critical step in the energy transition of supply chains. But it requires collaboration across the entire ecosystem including private companies, regulators, and infrastructure providers. The Laneshift e-Dutra initiative shows how cross-sector cooperation can accelerate this transition and deliver tangible benefits to the communities along Brazil’s most important freight corridor.

– Morten Bo Christiansen, Head of Energy Transition, A.P. Moller – Maersk

The e-Dutra corridor is a landmark for sustainable freight and a powerful example of what collaboration can achieve.

WBCSD is looking forward to supporting the initiative and help accelerate the systemic transformation of transportation in Brazil and beyond.

– Diane Holdorf, Executive Vice President, WBCSD

Corporates strengthen efforts to scale ZEV and infrastructure deployment in Europe

At COP30, businesses are joining forces under the new ZEV European Coalition to drive regional dialogues and shape opportunities for scaling implementation and investments in ZEV & charging infrastructure deployment.

The European Commission-led Green Deal, Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) and Clean Transport Corridor Initiative (CTCI) are driving crucial opportunities for accelerated investment and implementation in European green corridors.

The WBCSD ZEV European Coalition (ZEV EC) will seek to reinforce these efforts, targeting the deployment of tens of thousands of EV, charging units and Renewable Energy Sources across the region, and call for integrated and clear policies and standards that will drive electrification.

Businesses and cities come together to prepare for Future Urban Mobility

Urban mobility accounts for 40% of passenger’s global transport CO2 emissions, and passenger and freight demand are projected to double by 2050. Cities face mounting pressure to address three core challenges:

how to reduce their ecological impact (reducing GHG emissions, air pollution and optimizing energy use);

how to deliver inclusive, accessible mobility;

how to make sustainable mobility attractive and economically viable for users and operators.

In 2025, WBCSD members continue to drive the co-design of the future mobility solutions that are sustainable, accessible, and collaborate with cities to shape affordable solutions. These dialogues will shape actionable roadmaps through 2026 and beyond.

Urban mobility is at the heart of a sustainable future. At Volkswagen Group, we are driving the transformation toward cleaner, smarter, and more connected mobility solutions, where every journey contributes to a better quality of life for all. By systematically developing our portfolio by fostering solutions like MOIA’s autonomous and shared mobility services, we’re turning this vision into reality—making sustainable, accessible transportation an everyday experience.

– Dirk Voeste, Chief Sustainability Officer, Volkswagen Group

Digitalization and AI will be essential to efficiently plan urban mobility systems, optimizing infrastructure and network investments, and allowing for operational efficiencies. Since 2019, mobility sector companies at WBCSD have developed value chain frameworks to scale sustainable mobility services, demonstrating how public-private collaboration based on data exchange can accelerate and optimize deploymentof charging infrastructure, drive more efficient and user-centric mobility, or enhance transport resilience.

Our multi-fuel bus pilot with Rybnik demonstrated how granular data-driven fuel optimization can strategically manage fuel mixes (Hydrogen and, ICE) to reduce GHG emissions while increasing resilience. This initiative, highlighting the power of digital collaboration and integrated transport systems for better investment decisions and urban mobility, offers crucial insights for logistics (HGV fleets) to achieve economically viable and environmentally responsible decarbonization.

– Sinead Kaiya, Corporate Executive Officer, EVP, Global Solutions Business Group (Strategic Planning), Fujitsu Limited

A timely transition cannot happen without global frameworks to scale low carbon fuels for maritime and aviation

Beyond road transport, the maritime, aviation, and rail sectors together account for around 25% of global transport emissions.

The “beyond road” sector faces complex challenges to decarbonize, including a lagging business case for alternative fuels, prohibitive prices, a lack of integration across value chains and regional roadmaps, and low standardization of recognized emissions accounting standards slowing demand for industry solutions.

The energy transition that the shipping industry is undertaking is challenging, yet the technology is ready with dual fuel vessels already operating. We see several technological and fuel pathways ahead, including liquified biomethane, biodiesel, and alcohols such as e- and bio-methanol where we have our largest offtake agreement starting production already next year. As with other transport sectors, the energy transition of shipping requires action and support from an entire ecosystem, including fuel producers, ship owners, regulators, and many more.

– Morten Bo Christiansen, Head of Energy Transition, A.P. Moller – Maersk

Scaling the maritime sector’s net-zero transition will demand USD $2.6 trillion by 2050, USD $2 trillion of which is for zero-emission fuel production. Meeting the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) long-term aviation decarbonization goals will require approximately USD $3.2 trillion by 2050, with USD $19–45 billion alone needed by 2030 to scale sustainable aviation fuel production.

Globally, the requirement for SAF is estimated at 183 million tonnes by 2040.

Julien Manhes, Head of SAF and CDR (Carbon Dioxide Removal) Development, Sustainability Organisation at Airbus, said a voluntary scheme for SAF will be an ""opportunity for airlines to differentiate and to propose something new to their corporate customers first, then to cargo customers and eventually to private customers"".

India is one of the world's fastest-growing civil aviation markets, and Indian carriers have placed orders for more than 1,700 aircraft. As part of sustainability efforts, the government will soon be coming out with a SAF policy.

Elaborating on the value proposition of having the voluntary SAF programmes, Manhes told PTI in an interview in the national capital that the idea is about selling business travel experience with not only good seats and meals but also with a ""lower carbon footprint"".

In the context of the airlines' grouping, IATA's view that SAF blending mandates without incentives is a ""no-go area"", Manhes opined that creating voluntary demand for SAF will not result in market distortion.

He observed that airlines are reluctant to opt for SAF schemes without incentives because they will incur more costs as the fuel itself comes at a higher cost.

""Voluntary demand is not a market distortion. It is an add-on,"" he noted.

India aims to have 1 per cent blending of SAF in jet fuel by 2027, 2 per cent blending by 2028 and 5 per cent blending by 2030. SAF can be used as a drop-in fuel in Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), which powers aircraft.

Manhes said the idea is to help airlines in India to develop a mechanism and products for voluntary SAF programmes, and then make sure that the demand materialises.

""If a corporate can fulfil its CSR obligation, even partially through SAF purchase, then the incentive is obvious,"" he added.

Under the Companies Law, a certain class of profitable corporates are required to shell out at least two per cent of their three-year average annual profit towards CSR activities in a financial year.

Manhes also said that feedstock collection for SAF will be a huge opportunity for collateral socio-economic benefits, and that applies to India like any other country.

India has more than 750 million tonnes of available biomass and nearly 213 million tonnes of surplus agricultural residue. Utilisation of feedstock for SAF production is also expected to help farmers increase their income.

A recent study by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), in partnership with Worley Consulting, said that India can emerge as a significant centre for sustainable aviation fuel production in South Asia, and the country's potential biomass feedstock for the fuel is projected to be 100 million tonnes by 2030.

""Regulations, targets, mandates, whatever you call it, will not get us to where we need to be to reach net zero in 2050... You need voluntary demands, "" he emphasised.

Long seen as one of the most promising routes to decarbonising flight, SAF has historically struggled with scalability, cost and complexity.

However, in a lab at the University of Alberta, a young researcher believes those barriers are finally beginning to fall.

The research, conducted under the supervision of Prof. David C. Bressler, focuses on advancing the lipid-tohydrocarbon (LTH) process for renewable fuel production.

PhD student Bernardo Souto and his colleagues at the Biorefining Conversions and Fermentation Laboratory (Bressler’s lab) have been working hand-in-hand with analytical technology giant PerkinElmer to unlock a new way of producing renewable jet fuel.

The collaboration, which began under the Alberta Biojet Initiative (ABI), has led to a major breakthrough in how wa

ste fats and oils can be converted into high-quality, ready-to-use aviation fuel. “It’s an incredibly exciting time,” said Souto at the start of his discussion with the magazine’s editor.

“Our process takes lipids from virtually any source, animal fats, used cooking oil, even algae, and converts them directly into hydrocarbons suitable for jet engines.

“The best part is that it’s cleaner, cheaper and more efficient than many existing methods.”

A collaboration born from challenge

The partnership between PerkinElmer and the University of Alberta began in earnest in 2019, when the ABI was launched as a $7 million (€6 million) collaboration involving Natural Resources Canada, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Prairies Economic Development Canada, Alberta, Future Energy Systems, the Faculty of Agricultural, Life & Environmental Sciences at the University of Alberta, Edmonton International Airport, and FORGE Hydrocarbons, which is the industry and commercialisation partner.

The goal: to develop and demonstrate technologies capable of producing sustainable aviation fuel from Canadian feedstocks. At that time, Souto’s research group, led by Prof. Bressler, was already known for its pioneering work in lipid conversion – transforming oils and fats into renewable hydrocarbons.

However, as their experiments grew more complex, so did their analytical needs. “We had the technology, but we needed precision,” Souto explained. “We were generating hundreds of compounds in our reactions, and we needed to identify and quantify every one of them accurately. That’s when PerkinElmer came in.”

Working closely with PerkinElmer’s engineers and technicians, the Bressler’s lab team helped design and optimise a suite of advanced analytical instruments, including gas chromatographs, thermal analysers and elemental analysers, specifically tailored for renewable fuel research.

PerkinElmer was very supportive giving the department good price reductions, allowing the team not only to push their research further, but to showcase how such analytical innovation could accelerate the wider biofuels sector. “They really helped us bridge the gap between laboratory curiosity and industrial application,” Souto continued.

“By giving us access to cutting-edge tools, we could understand our feedstocks, track every product and evaluate our yields in real time.”

From laboratory bench to industrial scale

What began as a proofof- concept in 2003 has since matured into a fullscale demonstration.

Over two decades of development, the Bressler’s lab team has advanced from tiny microreactors producing millilitres of fuel to pilot-scale systems capable of generating 20 kilograms per hour.

Each step has refined the process, and each scale-up has been guided by careful analysis.

The underlying technology, now patented and licensed to FORGE Hydrocarbons, a Canadian spin-off company from the university, offers a compelling new route to SAF. FORGE is currently constructing its first commercial plant in Sombra, Ontario, designed to produce renewable diesel and later expand to sustainable jet fuel production.

What makes the FORGE LTH Process unique is its feedstock flexibility and simplicity.

Traditional SAF pathways, such as the widely used hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) route, depend on expensive catalysts and high-purity feedstocks.

In contrast, the FORGE LTH Process relies primarily on temperature and pressure to break down complex lipids into usable hydrocarbons, eliminating the need for catalysts or hydrogen during the renewable diesel stage. For sustainable aviation fuel production, only small amounts of hydrogen are later introduced to improve fuel properties while maintaining a low carbon profile. “It’s what we call a ‘feedstock-agnostic’ process,” Souto explained.

“It doesn’t matter if the oil comes from plants, animals, or microorganisms, we can use it.

“It also doesn’t need to be pristine. Even waste or low-quality fats can be turned into clean, drop-in fuels that are chemically similar to diesel or jet fuel.” This simplicity has powerful implications for scalability and cost reduction.

The PerkinElmer effect

PerkinElmer’s technical collaboration and support were instrumental in advancing the analytical component of our SAF research.

Their instruments have given the researchers a clearer view of what happens inside the process, helping them understand and optimise the chemistry in unprecedented detail. “In the early days, analysing a single gas sample required several instruments and additional time to obtain a full picture,” Souto recalled.

“We needed to use several instruments to get a full picture. Thanks to the new system we developed with PerkinElmer, we can now complete the same analysis more efficiently and with greater accuracy.”

The collaboration has also produced an online gas chromatograph capable of sampling directly from the process. This innovation allows researchers to monitor chemical changes in real time.

“It means we can literally see what’s happening inside the process at the push of a button,” said Souto.

“That’s a huge leap forward for optimisation. It helps us connect process conditions to the chemistry, and the chemistry to the final product.” This ability to obtain rapid, high-resolution data has dramatically improved research efficiency.

“When you’re running pilot plants, you’re generating hundreds of samples a day,” Souto noted.

“You can’t afford to spend hours analysing each one. The speed and reliability we’ve achieved have made a massive difference.”

From waste to wings

While the past focus was on renewable diesel, the Bressler’s lab ultimate goal is clear: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The demand for SAF is rising rapidly as airlines and governments set aggressive decarbonisation targets. Aviation currently accounts for around 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects that demand for jet fuel will double by 2050.

“If we want to fly more without worsening emissions, we need alternatives,” Souto said.

“We don’t have to replace fossil fuels entirely, but we do need to meet growing demand with sustainable options.”

Souto envisions a future where modular SAF production units can operate directly at airports, using locally available waste oils to produce fuel on site. “Imagine collecting used cooking oil from a city’s restaurants and converting it into jet fuel right at the airport,” he said.

“That’s the kind of decentralised model that FORGE Hydrocarbons is deploying.”

The potential advantages of the process extend beyond cost and logistics. Unlike HEFA fuels, which often lack aromatic compounds necessary for jet engine performance, the FORGE LTH Process naturally produces a broader spectrum of hydrocarbons, including aromatics, that can make the resulting fuel more compatible with current aviation standards.

“In theory, our fuel could be used without blending,” Souto suggested. “That’s what we’re testing now – ensuring it meets ASTM specifications for drop-in use.”

Scaling up for the SAF era

The team’s progress so far is impressive. More than 100 pilot campaigns have been conducted, amounting to over 2,000 hours of continuous operation.

The renewable diesel produced already meets Canadian fuel quality standards, and work is now underway to finalise testing for SAF certification. The transition from renewable diesel to aviation-grade fuel is not just a chemical step, but a regulatory one.

Every new SAF pathway must pass rigorous ASTM testing to ensure compatibility, safety and performance.

Souto’s team is now focusing on the fine-tuning required to meet those standards, analysing molecular profiles, and ensuring consistent quality across feedstocks.

“This is where PerkinElmer continues to be critical,” said Souto. “We’re studying how different feedstocks behave and how composition affects the end product. The goal is to tailor the process so we can control the properties we need.”

The University of Alberta’s research does not stop there. The team is also exploring how reaction parameters can be optimised for energy efficiency and carbon reduction, potentially opening doors to on-site SAF production at regional airports or refineries.

FORGE Hydrocarbons, meanwhile, is moving ahead with its commercial deployment.

Once the Ontario plant is fully operational, it will represent one of Canada’s most advanced renewable fuel facilities and a proof point for a process that could reshape the market.

The future of flight, fuelled by partnership

Looking ahead, Souto believes that collaboration between academia and industry will remain vital to progress.

“We’re always facing new challenges,” he said. “That’s the nature of research. But the partnership with PerkinElmer allows us to tackle them faster, to develop new tools, new methods, and ultimately better fuels.”

For PerkinElmer, the collaboration is equally rewarding, demonstrating how advanced analytical science can accelerate clean energy innovation. The company now uses the Alberta lab as a demonstration site, showcasing to other researchers and industry partners how cutting-edge instrumentation can drive real-world breakthroughs.

Each year, Dr Bressler and Souto present their findings as part of PerkinElmer’s seminar series, sharing lessons from their SAF journey and highlighting how analytical precision translates into cleaner skies.

A cleaner horizon

As airlines, governments and fuel producers worldwide push towards net-zero, the need for viable, scalable SAF solutions has never been greater. The FORGE LTH Process could well be one of the keys to meeting that challenge.

By combining scientific rigour, industrial insight and the power of partnership, Souto and his colleagues are proving that the future of flight does not have to come at the expense of the planet.

“We’re not trying to reinvent aviation,” Souto concluded. “We’re just making it sustainable – one drop of fuel at a time.”

Travellers flying in economy and premium economy, as well as those on short-haul routes, will be charged far less.

Those customers will pay an additional S$1 for trips to Southeast Asia, and S$10.40 for flights to the Americas, the civil aviation authority of Singapore said Monday. Business and first class travelers will pay four times more, it said.

The sustainable aviation fuel levy will be applied on tickets sold from April 1 for flights departing Singapore from October 1. Passengers transiting through the city-state won't need to pay the fee. Cargo flights will also incur a duty, which will be charged on a per-kilogram basis. Singapore is the first country in the world to tax passengers, and the levy is especially significant given its role as a global aviation hub. Its Changi Airport is poised for a record year, with this year's passenger numbers on track to exceed the previous all-time high of 68.3 million hit in 2019.

The funds collected from passengers will go to the centralised purchase of sustainable aviation fuel-typically made from waste oils or agricultural feedstock-as Singapore looks to achieve a SAF adoption rate of 3% to 5% by 2030. The global aviation sector makes up a relatively small portion of global greenhouse gas emissions-just 1.2% last year, according to the European Commission.

But surging demand for travel, coupled with the higher cost of sustainable fuels and their limited availability, are among key hurdles for the industry's efforts to decarbonise.

While SAF production doubled last year, it accounted for only 0.3% of global jet fuel volumes, according to the International Air Transport Association.

Singapore's announcement coincides with the COP30 meeting in Brazil, where negotiators from nearly 200 countries are set to thrash out technical details on the world's efforts to mitigate climate change. While the duties may be a surprise to some travelers, they're cheaper than initially feared. The government had previously estimated them at between S$3 and S$16, but a decline in SAF costs has prompted a smaller levy.

In general, such airlines costs simply get passed onto passengers, e.g. airport levy etc. Costs where airlines can compete against each other with may not get passed on (e.g. fuel efficiency from route planning by SQ means another airline will have to match and can't pass on) - which then becomes an edge for that airline (in this example SQ).

because singapore is pro business and doesn’t want point get sticker shock when browsing for tickets. so instead it becomes a “tax” and is added at the end of the transaction instead.

The new site in Seal Sands, on land where the former INEOS Nitriles facility was located, sits just 500 metres from the previous Billingham location.
“The move to our new site means we are now even better placed to become a global leader in sustainable aviation fuel production.
Our project was already the most advanced dedicated SAF project in the UK, and one of the largest of its kind anywhere in the world,"" said Alfanar UK Country Head, Noaman Al Adhami.
“We’re proud to welcome further enhancements to this landmark project, which will bring thousands of top-quality jobs and opportunities for local firms.","Global project development, manufacturing and engineering group Alfanar has today confirmed a move to a larger, more enhanced site for its Lighthouse Green Fuels (LGF) SAF project. During a keynote to aviation leaders at the Airlines 2025 conference in London, UK Country Head of Alfanar Noaman Al Adhami also unveiled a new dedicated brand and website for LGF which is wholly owned by Alfanar.

The £2bn LGF project will convert 1.5m tonnes of sustainably sourced biomass feedstocks –including forestry, sawmill, and agricultural residues in line with the UK SAF Mandate – into more than 180m litres of second-generation SAF every year, offsetting the equivalent carbon emissions of 27,000 short-haul flights.

The new site in Seal Sands, on land where the former INEOS Nitriles facility was located, sits just 500 metres from the previous Billingham location. It offers closer access to critical infrastructure, including rail and shipping links, and enables the entire conversion process to take place on one site, from feedstock pre-treatment to storage.

It is also even closer to carbon capture and storage infrastructure, providing the opportunity for seamless integration into the network when online. This would enable SAF to be produced with a 200% lifecycle emissions reduction compared to conventional jet fuel – enough to meet 11% of the UK’s 2030 SAF Mandate.

“The move to our new site means we are now even better placed to become a global leader in sustainable aviation fuel production. Our project was already the most advanced dedicated SAF project in the UK, and one of the largest of its kind anywhere in the world,"" said Alfanar UK Country Head, Noaman Al Adhami. ""This relocation drives further operational and supply chain efficiencies and means we are better placed to increase production capacity in the future once the first phase of the project is underway.”

“Teesside is leading the charge in the industries of the future, and Alfanar’s £2 billion investment to build the world’s biggest sustainable aviation fuel plant of its kind is a clear sign of that leadership,"" said Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen, who visited Alfanar’s London HQ. “We’re proud to welcome further enhancements to this landmark project, which will bring thousands of top-quality jobs and opportunities for local firms. Having a project of this scale built right here shows what we already know - that Teesside has the people, skills and drive to deliver ground breaking projects like this.”",https://www.processingjournal.com/assets/favicons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-10 23:56:11.860632

Aemetis also provided an update of biodiesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) projects.

During an earnings call, Aemetis Chairman and CEO Eric McAfee reported that the company’s RNG business significantly increased biogas production capacity at the end of the third quarter with a new multi-dairy digester that came online in September. That facility increased RNG capacity by more than 30%. According to McAfee, Aemetis remains on track to have more than 500,000 MMBtus of RNG capacity in place by the end of 2025, increasing to 1 MMBtus by the end of 2026. Aemetis is currently operating or building digesters to process waste from 18 dairies.

The California Air Resources Board earlier this year approved Low Carbon Fuel Standard pathways for seven of Aemetis’ dairy digesters, with an average carbon intensity (CI) score of -384 gCO2e/MJ. “These pathway approvals increased our LCFS credit revenue by 160% for these dairies starting in the third quarter of this year, compared to dairy digesters with the -150 default pathway score while pathways are pending approval,” McAfee said, noting four additional LCFS pathways are currently under review at CARB.

McAfee confirmed that the company’s RNG facilities qualify for the Section 48 energy investment tax credit. RNG output also qualifies for 45Z clean fuel production tax credits. “Collectively, molecule revenues, LCFS credit sales, D3 [renewable identification number (RIN)] sales and the sale of 45Z production tax credits are expected to generate strong positive cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter of this year and expanding operating cash flow in 2026, as new dairy RNG production comes online 45Z calculations are issued by the Department of Energy and LCFS credit prices continue to rise,” he said.

Regarding operations at the Keyes ethanol plant, McAfee reported that the mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) system is completing equipment fabrication. On-site construction is expected to begin during the fourth quarter of 2025 and be complete during the second quarter of 2026. The MVR system is expected to reduce natural gas consumption at the ethanol plant by 80%, according to McAfee.

The Keyes plant reduced ethanol production during Spring 2025 in order to optimize ethanol margins. McAfee said the facility ramped up production during the third quarter due to higher ethanol demand and improved margins. Higher production is expected to continue during the fourth quarter.

Aemetis also operates a biodiesel subsidiary in India, which is targeting an initial public offering (IPO) in early 2026. McAfee said the company is actively seeking to expand into biogas and ethanol production in India.

In addition, Aemetis is working to develop the Riverbank biorefinery, a 90 MMgy SAF and renewable diesel facility in California, along with CCS capacity. According to McAfee, the company continues to engage in active discussions on financing structures for the Riverbank project, and is waiting further clarity on the 45Z production credit and biofuel mandates to support project financing. For the adjacent CCS project, Aemetis has completed initial site and installation work for its CO2 characterization well. The data obtained from the next phase of drill will support the company’s Class VI permit application.

Aemetis sold 14.7 million gallons of ethanol during the third quarter of 2025, down from 15.5 million gallons sold during the same period of 2024. For the first nine months of the year, ethanol sales reached 42.6 million gallons, down from 44.4 million gallons sold during the same period of last year.
