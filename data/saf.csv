-- The Cathay Group and Airbus have announced a joint investment agreement of up to US$70 million (HK$545 million) to accelerate the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production in Asia and globally.

The agreement was announced in Hong Kong on the sidelines of the IATA World Sustainability Symposium at a ceremony hosted by Cathay Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer Alex McGowan, and Airbus President Asia Pacific Anand Stanley.

Under the terms of the partnership, the two companies will work to identify, evaluate and invest in projects that support the scaling of SAF production towards 2030 and beyond. Projects will be assessed based on their commercial viability, technological maturity, and potential for long-term offtake.

Scaling SAF adoption requires deep collaboration across the value chain, from policymakers and investors to SAF producers, airlines and customers. This co-investment agreement reflects the spirit of partnership with Airbus and Cathay teaming up to accelerate production capability for more meaningful impact.

Cathay’s Alex McGowan said: “SAF remains the most important lever for Cathay and the wider aviation industry to drive toward our common decarbonisation goals. This co-investment partnership with Airbus underscores our commitment to supporting a more scalable SAF industry in the near term. It complements our broader strategy of investing in the technologies and production capacity that can transform the industry in the long run, including our participation in the recently launched oneworld BEV SAF Fund. Meanwhile, we are also expanding SAF usage today through partnerships with like-minded organisations.”

Airbus’s Anand Stanley said: “This agreement reflects the shared commitment of Airbus and Cathay to make a real difference. The production and distribution of affordable SAF at scale requires an unprecedented cross-sectoral approach. Our partnership with Cathay is a concrete example of how we catalyse production in the most suitable locations to serve our customers.”

The partnership also includes collaboration to advocate for supportive SAF policies on both the supply and demand side across Asia. With the region’s strong potential in feedstock supply, production capacity, and its vibrant aviation market, Cathay and Airbus aim to leverage their global experience to help shape policies that make SAF more accessible and affordable in this part of the world.

Last month, Cathay also joined as a launch investor in the oneworld BEV SAF Fund, a joint initiative with other oneworld airlines and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the climate investment firm founded by Bill Gates. That fund focuses on novel, next-generation SAF technologies with the potential to scale significantly and reduce costs. Complementing this, the Cathay–Airbus partnership announced today will target more mature SAF opportunities to accelerate near- to medium-term availability.

Cathay and Airbus have a long-standing partnership dating back to 1989, when the airline placed its first order for Airbus aircraft. Today, the Cathay Group operates more than 85 Airbus aircraft, with an outstanding order for over 70 more to be delivered.

Stockholm Arlanda Airport implements Established on RNP, allowing more curved approaches, reducing emissions, increasing landing efficiency, and supporting airlines’ transition to sustainable aviation fuel.

Swedavia and Luftfartsverket (LFV) have become the first in Europe to introduce a new air traffic approach concept, known as Established on RNP (EoR), at Stockholm Arlanda Airport. The innovation enables aircraft to perform more curved approaches than before, marking a major step towards improving air traffic capacity, efficiency, and sustainability.

“For us, it is of course gratifying that Swedavia will be the first in Europe to apply the new concept for managing arrivals. Enabling more curved approaches is also the most effective way to support airlines in their transition work, in addition to facilitating increased use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF),” said Susanne Norman, Director of Operations at Swedavia.

The new approach method allows more flexible and efficient arrivals by increasing the number of aircraft that can land per hour while reducing overall emissions. Aircraft flying the curved approach follow shorter flight paths, while reduced congestion on the main arrival runway cuts fuel burn and delays. Airlines, however, must have a special permit from their National Supervisory Authority to conduct these procedures.

Anna Granberg, Director of Operations at Luftfartsverket, said: “The modernisation of the airspace by Luftfartsverket shows how air traffic control can help reduce the environmental impact of aviation. The traffic flow into Stockholm Arlanda Airport becomes more efficient during peak hours, and arriving aircraft have shorter flight paths with reduced emissions.”

Airlines have also welcomed the initiative. Charlotte Holmbergh, Country Director Corporate Affairs at Norwegian, said: “We are very pleased with the initiative from Swedavia and the Swedish Air Traffic Control Provider (LFV) to implement new procedures that will increase the number of curved approaches (RNP AR – Required Navigation Performance, Authorisation Required) at Arlanda. Shorter approaches result in lower fuel burn and reduced emissions. Our goal is to reduce emissions by 30 percent by 2030, and more efficient flight operations like this are among our top priorities, alongside increased use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and continuous fleet renewal.”

Similarly, SAS has praised the development. “SAS welcomes all initiatives that help reduce fuel consumption, noise, and emissions. The introduction of the new approach concept is a step in the right direction towards a more efficient and more sustainable airspace around Arlanda,” said Alexandra Lindgren Kaoukji, Head of External Communication and PR at SAS.

The EoR technique requires specially equipped aircraft, trained pilots, and authorisation from the relevant authority. Alongside its environmental benefits, the new system encourages airlines to invest in technology that enables curved approaches, helping to further minimise overflight of noise-sensitive areas.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/air-traffic-3.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 07:56:12.061207

What is sustainable aviation fuel?

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is an alternative fuel made from non-petroleum renewable feedstocks including woody biomass and fats and greases.

Currently, SAF can be used in blends between 10% and 50%, depending on the feedstock and its production.

Using SAF offers many benefits, including more flexibility in production technologies, compatibility with engines and infrastructure and fewer emissions.

SAF has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 94% if used in a 100% blend, compared with traditional jet fuel.

100% SAF: Honda’s mission

Honda Aircraft Company has become the first twin-turbine very light business jet manufacturer to successfully fuel a flight running a 100% blend of sustainable aviation fuels.

The HondaJet model flew over the Greensboro area of North Carolina, US before landing at the company’s global headquarters at Piedmont Triad International Airport.

The company previously produced early demonstrations of 100% SAF use in 2022 and 2023, with tests of its HF120 engine on the ground.

Amod Kelkar, Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer at Honda Aircraft Company, says: “We are immensely proud of our Honda Aircraft Company engineering team carrying forward our commitment to the future of aviation by demonstrating that the HondaJet is capable of operating on a 100% SAF blend.

“This achievement is a step toward aligning our business activities with the global Honda goal of decarbonising our business activities by 2050.”

The most optimistic scenario would also provide a further 700,000t made up of synthetic aviation fuel.
EASA believes production capacities will be “sufficient” to meet the minimum 6% share of sustainable fuel – excluding synthetics – for 2030, as set out by the regulations.
Synthetic fuel was absent from the fuel mix last year, highlighting the early-stage nature of its development.","Sustainable aviation fuel in the European Union only accounted for 0.6% of the total uplift last year, but the initial status report on new fuelling regulations points out that the 2% mandatory threshold requirement did not take effect until this year.

Suppliers provided 32.1 million tonnes of aviation fuel overall to EU airports but only 192,700t was sustainable.

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency gave the figure in a report detailing findings for 2024, the first year of ReFuelEU Aviation implementation.

EASA states that two-thirds of 123 obligated fuel suppliers complied with the requirement to submit reports.

“This somewhat lower compliance rate can largely be attributed to the fact that the primary obligation to supply a minimum share of [sustainable aviation fuel] was not yet applicable,” it says.

EASA also suggests the “first-time nature” of the 2024 period probably kept reporting rates low. But the data nevertheless has been valuable, it adds, serving as a “dry run” and offering insights into the preparedness of stakeholders.

According to the fuel suppliers’ submissions, almost the entirety of sustainable fuel provided to EU airports – about 98% – comprised aviation biofuels, with those obtained from cooking oil feedstock accounting for 81%.

While the quantity of sustainable fuel supplied was low, EASA says it reduced carbon emissions by 91% compared with the conventional fuel it replaced.

Aircraft operators purchased about 358,000t of sustainable fuel last year – about 0.81% of the total uplifted fuel at EU airports.

EASA found a “notable increase” in the number of EU countries hosting sustainable fuel production activity – listing 17 in total, up from 12 the previous year.

It forecasts three scenarios for sustainable fuel production in 2030, estimating available capacity at between 1.4 million and 5.2 million tonnes depending on progress with facilities. The most optimistic scenario would also provide a further 700,000t made up of synthetic aviation fuel.

This roughly translates to a cost of almost US$35 per passenger per year, a figure five times higher than the approximately US$7 the airline industry makes on average per year with every passenger it carries.
“If the levies don’t lead to significant increases in SAF production, then they are not achieving what they were intended to do, and a new design is needed,” Walsh stated.
Walsh said IATA had raised this issue in Brussels with European regulators and legislators, as airlines sought ways to prevent this practice.
While admitting the matter required further assessment, he specifically highlighted Singapore’s SAF mandate plan, noting that, even if it contained some interesting elements, initial analysis suggested it could encounter similar problems to the European approach, particularly its inability to effectively encourage SAF production.","Willie Walsh, Director General of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has expressed concern about the way airlines are made to carry most of the burden of the European Union’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate.

Speaking at the 3rd IATA World Sustainability Symposium, which is taking place in Hong Kong, October 21-22, 2025, Walsh stated that, while the airline industry remains committed to decarbonization, some elements of the current mandate design are not fit for purpose.

According to the airline executive, rather than leading to a boost in SAF production, as was intended by regulators, the mandate, which sets minimum SAF procurement requirements for airlines over time, has led to price hikes for airlines while production remains way below expectations.

Walsh, who was joined on stage by IATA’s VP Sustainability & Chief Economist, Marie Owens Thomsen, quantified the cost of the airline industry’s transition to net zero at US$174 billion per year. This roughly translates to a cost of almost US$35 per passenger per year, a figure five times higher than the approximately US$7 the airline industry makes on average per year with every passenger it carries.

Both Walsh and Owens Thomsen dismissed comments from industry figures critical of the industry’s net zero goals. Ryanair’s CEO Michael O’Leary has notoriously stated that the “net zero agenda is dead.” However, while both defended the decarbonization drive as necessary over the long term, they called for a different approach.

“If the levies don’t lead to significant increases in SAF production, then they are not achieving what they were intended to do, and a new design is needed,” Walsh stated.

In this regard, Walsh highlighted the United States’ approach in providing incentives as having yielded more tangible results than the European one. This difference in approach is often referred to in the industry as the “carrot vs. stick” debate.

The airline executive, who is known in the industry for being outspoken, also denounced that the lion’s share of the SAF mandate costs have fallen on the airlines, while other operators had been benefiting from them.

In particular Walsh was critical of fuel suppliers, which, he said, had raised prices well above the expected differential between SAF and conventional fuel, linking this markup to a “compliance surcharge”. Walsh said IATA had raised this issue in Brussels with European regulators and legislators, as airlines sought ways to prevent this practice.

At this point, Owens Thomsen noted that, despite its fundamental role in society and the broader economy, commercial aviation had historically been a low margin, low profit industry, with net margins never surpassing 5% on average for the ensemble of carriers. She contraposed this to the much larger profit margins enjoyed by the oil and gas industry.

Replying to questions by journalists from the Asia-Pacific region, Walsh issued a note of caution regarding the steps other countries are taking to follow the European example.

While admitting the matter required further assessment, he specifically highlighted Singapore’s SAF mandate plan, noting that, even if it contained some interesting elements, initial analysis suggested it could encounter similar problems to the European approach, particularly its inability to effectively encourage SAF production.

“My advice would be to be very careful,” he said, “because Europe doesn’t always get it right.”",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/10/iata-wss.JPG,N,,2025-10-22 07:56:39.888949

Undertaking this review was one of the key recommendations for Government emanating from the recent Project Willow report, a joint UK and Scottish Government feasibility study that explored low-carbon industrial alternatives for Scotland's Grangemouth site.

The primary option is camelina, which is already grown in several other countries for aviation fuel and is also grown in the UK for the health food market. It is seen as a possible alternative, along with oil seed rape, due to the quality of its oil.

A further project will now investigate how camelina will grow in Scottish conditions and how it could fit into Scotland’s agricultural rotations, as well as the potential impacts, positive and negative, on the environment through a series of small field trials.

“Camelina, particularly winter grown camelina, is a relatively novel crop for Scotland” said Dr Tracy Valentine, senior research scientist at the Hutton, who will lead the field trials project. “By growing over winter, we hope to fit in with the main spring cropping season. Initially we will be looking at frost tolerance, growth rates, pests and fertiliser requirements, and ease of crop agronomy for farmers. This work will help to understand the potential for camelina to be grown as a biofuel crop in Scotland. Camelina is an oil seed plant, similar to oil seed rape and is part of the Brassicaceae (commonly known as mustard) plant family. It is widely grown across north America and Europe and is used for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production due to its high oil content and ultra-low carbon intensity compared to other alternative crops.”

One tonne of camelina seeds can be converted into approximately 200-230 litres of aviation fuel though this amount varies depending on factors like the seed's oil content, which is typically 38-47 percent. A light aircraft burns, on average, 22 to 45 litres of fuel per hour.

Camelina oil is also increasingly being used as a cooking oil. It is rich in vitamin E and omega fatty acids and has a higher smoking point than most other cooking oils.

The Hutton offers world-leading scientific solutions to the challenges posed by the climate and nature crises and is well-placed to contribute to the Scottish Government’s ambitious target of 2045 for Scotland to reach net zero emissions for all greenhouse gases.

SRUC is committed to tackling some of the major challenges facing the world, including climate change, biodiversity loss and food security.

“At current market prices, economic viability would have to be considered, as its production is currently less competitive than other main crops in Scotland” added Dr Shailesh Shrestha, an agricultural economist at SRUC.

2025 is a landmark year for the UK’s aviation industry as it continues to make the transition to net zero. Recognised as a carbon-intensive sector, aviation faces a steep challenge to cut emissions. Yet meeting those objectives in lockstep with increasing global demand represents a significant opportunity for UK aerospace, which continues to be at the cutting edge of engine technology, wing production, aerostructures and design.

The truth is that the transition to net zero will be met by a cocktail of solutions. The global aircraft fleet is already 80% more fuel efficient than it was half a century ago, while each new generation of aircraft is 15-25% more fuel efficient than the preceding model.

That said, if more efficient and quieter aircraft are one solution, are there others? Airspace modernisation and contrail avoidance will go some way to reducing emissions. Disruptive technologies such as hydrogen and battery-powered aircraft will also support the transition. But hydrogen-powered aircraft for long-haul flights are not likely to arrive before 2050, and electric aircraft will serve a different purpose, operating at a smaller, regional scale.

Perhaps the most significant near-term solution, more efficient aircraft notwithstanding, is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). SAF reduces greenhouse gases by 70% on a lifecycle basis compared to kerosene. Further, in being compatible with existing infrastructure and technology, SAF represents an ideal alternative.

2025 is a big year for SAF in the UK. At the start of this year, a SAF Mandate was introduced, requiring fuel suppliers to use SAF for 2% of the fuel blend this year. This increases linearly to 10% by 2030, setting a guaranteed level of demand and supporting increased SAF production.

Sustainable aviation fuel policy priorities

The UK Government expects industry to require approximately 286 million litres of SAF this year to meet the mandate. But industry is already delivering above and beyond expectations, with provisional statistics from the Department for Transport revealing that 330 million litres were supplied to the UK last year alone. For the first time, the statistics also showed that the UK took delivery of 2 million litres of second-generation SAF, that is to say, organic municipal solid waste and sewage sludge.

With that said, almost all the SAF being supplied to the UK is derived from vegetable oils, fatty acids and waste cooking oils. While that represents the cheapest and most plentiful SAF, policies must be introduced to support advanced SAFs, which do not draw on valuable feedstocks. Action is also required to drive domestic SAF production, ensuring the UK does not miss out on a prized economic opportunity. Contextually, the Department for Transport estimates that SAF production could support up to 10,000 jobs by 2035 and generate £1.8 billion gross value added every year.

That is why Parliament is currently considering a Bill to introduce a Revenue Certainty Mechanism (RCM). This will give industry the confidence it needs to invest in SAF production by setting a General Strike Price, the same mechanism used to incentivise investment in renewable energy through the Contracts for Difference Scheme.

The aviation and aerospace sectors warmly welcome this initiative. Access to a reliable, affordable stream of SAF will be critical in the years ahead. However, the UK is competing in a global market where other nations are also standing up their own SAF industries.

It is, therefore, disappointing that the RCM will be funded by a levy on aviation fuel suppliers when the sector already pays for sustainability initiatives through the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). The UK also levies the highest rate of air passenger duty in Europe by a considerable margin. While we accept the ‘polluter pays’ principle, industry levies can only be used a few times before the UK’s international competitiveness is fundamentally compromised.

In internationalised sectors like aerospace and aviation, companies are highly mobile and operate out of those countries with favourable tax regimes and business environments. The UK should not risk future competitiveness by assuming industry has boundless scope to fund sustainability initiatives.

The single biggest thing the Government must do, however, is pass the Bill quickly. Currently, the Government have committed that the Bill will be enacted by the end of 2026. However, this leaves too little time for industry to respond before the SAF Mandate’s Power to Liquid obligation comes into force in 2028. Given the scale of a SAF plant, it is doubtful that the industry can navigate the planning process, complete construction, and operationalise in such a short period.

Succeeding in the global race to supply the SAF industry

The window of time for getting this right is narrow and closing quickly. While we are encouraged that the UK Government’s policy direction of travel is the right one, there is no time to waste if we are going to succeed in the global race to supply the SAF industry’s needs to meet its obligations.",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iStock-2206887611.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 04:56:12.012718

The Propane Education & Research Council is investing directly in farmers to advance clean, reliable energy on the farm. Through its Propane Farm Research Program, PERC offers growers the chance to offset costs of converting ag equipment to propane while contributing real-world data to help guide future propane technology.

The program applies to a wide range of equipment — from irrigation engines and building heat to power generation.

At Husker Harvest Days in September, Mike Newland, PERC’s director of agriculture business development, discussed the council rebate offers, which cover up to 25% of the cost — or $10,000 per unit — with participants eligible for rebates in each product category. Details are available at propane.com/pfrp.

Rather than hiring outside research firms, PERC compensates farmers to report back on their experiences using new propane technologies.

“We’re paying people to report their experience with a new piece of equipment and fuel,” Newland explained. Instead of hiring third-party researchers, real customers generate the data.

As electricity demand grows, propane offers a dependable and sustainable alternative. A Department of Energy study released in July highlighted ongoing grid instability. As a naturally clean energy source, propane offers a solution to this problem.

“We think this is one great way that we can help to get some of that demand off of the grid and onto a very clean, sustainable fuel source of propane,” Newland said.

At HHD, PERC showcased three propane irrigation engines — two from Industrial Irrigation in Hastings, Neb. — demonstrating how propane continues to power efficient irrigation.

Livestock industry

In livestock production, propane remains critical for both heat and backup power. Reserved as an emergency resource, this backup fuel tends to sit for a while.

However, when an emergency takes place, that fuel needs to be ready to go. Unlike diesel, which can degrade when stored, propane stays ready for emergencies.

“You have to be paying attention to diesel — you have to be conditioning it from time to time,” Newland said. “Propane doesn’t have those fuel quality issues.”

He went on to discuss the balanced goals in the agricultural industry and the influence that clean energy brings to the table. “I think in agriculture, we're all about being efficient, but also about being environmentally sound as well,” Newland explained.

Agriculture functions are the harmony of meeting a bottom line while also being conscious of the environment, which is the source of the industry.

Operators of heavy equipment know the battle with pollutant cleansing systems, such as DEF, all too well. The constant expense, compounded by reduced fuel economy, creates an ongoing operational challenge.

However, propane is officially recognized by the federal government as a clean alternative energy, simplifying operations and eliminating after-treatment systems. Moreover, as a viable resource in all climates, users don’t have to worry about temperature-related issues either.

Market dynamics and supply

As a leading producer in propane, the U.S. consumes only about 40% of these energy supplies domestically, with roughly 60% exported overseas. That balance has kept prices stable. But it raises questions about supply during heavy-use seasons.

Although the impact that tariffs have on the industry affects parts and component suppliers to some extent, Newland described the security within the industry. “Fuel prices have been very stable for a lot of years here,” he said.

With the grain-drying season, Newland urged producers to plan early.

To help growers estimate their propane needs, PERC offers an online grain drying calculator at propane.com. Farmers can enter acreage, yield and moisture data to get a rough estimate for planning.

“It’ll give you a rough calculation,” Newland explained. “It’s close enough that you can take that information to your supplier, have an initial conversation and get started on the planning.”

He cautioned against last-minute calls. “I know people who make that first call from the combine seat on the way to the first cornfield,” Newland said.

He encouraged producers to give their local suppliers time to consider personal situations and aid in developing the best, personalized plan for each operation.

PERC is backing new agricultural uses for propane, including a soil-injection technology that sterilizes seeds and controls nematodes. “It’s replacing a soil fumigant that isn’t great from an environmental standpoint,” Newland said. “This process is organic, and those acres will be qualified for organic production.”

The council is also researching renewable propane, created as a byproduct of sustainable aviation fuel. The renewable form has the same chemical structure but a lower carbon intensity.

“Any sustainable aviation fuel that’s created has a stream of propane that comes off that process,” Newland said. “It is renewable propane that would be used just like conventional propane.”

While renewable propane will likely reach on-road markets first because of pricing incentives, agriculture will eventually benefit.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/bltdd0fb129a84008d6/68f25e6a8363acd4b1fde75a/1020W1-1463A-1800x1012.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-22 07:57:02.879633

Congress passed legislation lifting the ban on supersonic flight over land.
Without this restriction, supersonic aircraft can operate more routes profitably.
Supersonic flight burns more fuel than subsonic flight.
Supersonic flight will remain a niche product for those willing to pay premium prices for time savings.","FREEHOLD- A company called FlyConcorde Ltd. is planning to bring back supersonic passenger flights, nearly 20 years after the original Concorde retired. The new aircraft could start service as early as 2026, though significant challenges remain before that becomes a reality.

The original Concorde stopped flying in 2003 after 27 years of service. High operating costs, limited routes, and a fatal crash in 2000 led to its retirement. Now, new technology and changed regulations are making another attempt possible.

Is Concorde to Make A Return?

The biggest change happened in the United States in June 2025. Congress passed legislation lifting the ban on supersonic flight over land. This ban had severely restricted where Concorde could fly. The aircraft could only go supersonic over oceans, limiting its route options and commercial viability.

Without this restriction, supersonic aircraft can operate more routes profitably. London to New York remains the obvious choice, but now domestic U.S. routes are becoming possible. Los Angeles to Washington could work, so could transcontinental routes across Europe or Asia.

Technology has also advanced significantly since Concorde’s era. The new design reportedly weighs 50 percent less than the original. It will use sustainable aviation fuel instead of conventional jet fuel.

The new aircraft design will allow it to cruise at altitudes up to 60,000 feet. This is way higher than the original Concorde’s typical cruising altitude.

Most importantly, engineers claim the new design produces much less sonic boom. The original Concorde’s loud sonic boom was a major problem. It damaged the aircraft’s public image and led to the overland flight bans. Reducing this noise is critical for any supersonic comeback.

Flight Time Reductions

The appeal of supersonic travel is obvious — dramatically shorter flight times. London to New York currently takes about 7 hours on today’s commercial aircraft. The new supersonic plane could cut that to 2-3 hours. Los Angeles to Washington drops from 5-6 hours to around 2 hours.

For business travelers, this time savings matters significantly. However, industry experts caution that this won’t be for everyone. It’s unlikely to appeal to average holidaymakers. The tickets will be expensive. The aircraft will be small, carrying far fewer passengers than modern widebody jets.

Airports need modifications to handle supersonic operations. Air traffic control systems must adapt. Ground handling procedures differ from conventional aircraft. All this requires investment and coordination.

What Challenges Remain?

Economic viability is the first major question. The original Concorde never made money for British Airways or Air France. Operating costs were extremely high. Ticket prices had to match those costs, limiting the potential customer base to wealthy business travelers and celebrities.

The new aircraft will be more efficient but still expensive to operate. Supersonic flight burns more fuel than subsonic flight. Even with sustainable aviation fuel, costs shall remain high. The small passenger capacity means each ticket needs to generate significant revenue.

Sonic boom concerns haven’t completely disappeared. While the new design reduces noise, it doesn’t eliminate it. Many countries and regions remain sensitive about noise pollution. Getting regulatory approval worldwide won’t be easy.

Potential Markets for Concorde

FlyConcorde Ltd. is targeting a 2026 launch, which seems optimistic given everything that needs to happen. The aircraft must complete development and testing.

Regulatory approvals must be secured from aviation authorities in multiple countries. Airlines need to commit to buying or leasing the planes. Airports must prepare for operations.

Even if the aircraft enters service by 2026, initial operations will likely be limited. A few routes with proven demand make sense, such as London to New York, which tops that list. But expanding beyond a handful of premium routes will take time and depend on the aircraft proving itself operationally and financially.

The aviation industry has seen multiple supersonic revival attempts over the past 20 years. Boom Supersonic, Aerion, and others have announced plans. So far, none have entered commercial service. Technical, regulatory, and financial obstacles have blocked each attempt.

Bottom Line

If FlyConcorde Ltd. succeeds, it won’t revolutionize air travel for most people. Supersonic flight will remain a niche product for those willing to pay premium prices for time savings. It can be thought of as the aviation equivalent of first-class or private jets – a luxury option that exists alongside mainstream travel.

For aviation enthusiasts, seeing a Concorde-style aircraft back in the skies would be exciting. The original Concorde remains iconic decades after retirement. A new supersonic era would mark a genuine technological achievement.

Whether that actually happens by 2026 remains very much in question. But at least for now, it seems like the 2026 date is too optimistic. The history of promised supersonic returns suggests caution. But changed regulations and improved technology give this attempt better odds than previous efforts.

The quarter was characterised by several important milestones, including the first-ever dividend, paid in August, and the exercise of a purchase option to acquire 30 additional new Boeing aircraft.

During the third quarter, the Norwegian Group recorded an operating profit (EBIT) of NOK 3,071 million. The operating margin was 25.1 percent. The liquidity position decreased to NOK 10.5 billion at the end of the quarter.

“We are very pleased to once again report a record quarter. In August, we paid our first-ever dividend of NOK 0.90 per share to approximately 75,000 shareholders. It has been a strong quarter overall, and I would like to thank all my colleagues in both Widerøe and Norwegian for their outstanding efforts during the busiest months of the year. Widerøe’s record-breaking passenger numbers also deserve recognition, which in September reached an all-time high in the company’s more than 90-year long history,” said Geir Karlsen, CEO of Norwegian.

In the third quarter, the Norwegian Group had 8.41 million passengers, of which 7.28 million were passengers of Norwegian and 1.12 million of Widerøe. The quarterly load factor for Norwegian was 88.3 percent, up 0.3 percentage points from last year, while Widerøe had a load factor of 77.5 percent, down 0.6 percentage points. Capacity increased 2 percent and 3 percent for Norwegian and Widerøe respectively. The quarter also held solid operational performance from both airlines. Widerøe stood out with 98.2 percent of scheduled flights taking place and a punctuality of 91.8 percent. Norwegian had a punctuality of 77.8 percent, up 3.6 percentage points from last year, and 99.3 percent of scheduled flights taking place.

Fleet renewal and Denmark on the rise

During the quarter, Norwegian expanded the existing Boeing order by exercising an option to purchase 30 additional Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft, increasing the total firm order to 80 aircraft.

“By exercising the Boeing purchase option, we maintain flexibility while reinforcing our commitment to operating one of Europe’s most modern and fuel-efficient fleets. This is an important step in our ongoing fleet renewal programme, and we are very pleased to further strengthen our long-term partnership with Boeing,” said Geir Karlsen.

October was an important month in Denmark, marked by several positive developments. The month began strongly with the announcement of ten new international routes from Billund airport. On the same day, Norwegian was named “Best European Airline” at the Danish Travel Awards. A few days later, Norwegian won the Danish government’s tender for a domestic route aimed at reducing climate impact. Under this agreement, 93 percent of Norwegian’s flights between Aalborg and Copenhagen will operate using at least 40 percent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from March next year. The project is expected to save approximately 6,700 tonnes of CO2 on a life-cycle basis.

Well prepared for the winter season

For the upcoming winter months, Norwegian has reduced the monthly capacity by between 25 to 40 percent, compared to the October capacity. This is to better align with demand during winter and optimise performance in the low season.

“We have an attractive route network in the winter season, well tailored to our customers’ needs. Booking trends are looking encouraging, and our customers are booking their flights further in advance this year compared to previous years. We have therefore sold more tickets this year, compared to the same time last year, with reduced capacity. This bodes well for a busy winter season with high load factors,” said Geir Karlsen.","https://mnd-assets.mynewsdesk.com/image/upload/ar_16:9,c_fill,dpr_auto,f_auto,g_auto,q_auto:good,w_1782/8emxl9lzu4h2odczsa8pat",N,,2025-10-22 02:56:15.436279

Stanley described the partnership as a practical step toward accelerating SAF availability.

“The production and distribution of affordable SAF at scale requires an unprecedented cross-sectoral approach. Our partnership with Cathay is a concrete example of how we catalyse production in the most suitable locations to serve our customers,” he said.

The collaboration will also see both companies advocate for policies that support SAF development and adoption across Asia, a region with strong potential for feedstock supply and production growth.

The announcement follows Cathay’s recent role as a launch investor in the oneworld BEV SAF Fund – an initiative led by oneworld airlines and Breakthrough Energy Ventures. While that fund targets emerging technologies, the new Cathay–Airbus partnership will focus on scaling mature SAF solutions for near- to medium-term deployment.

To be able to fly curved approaches, airlines must have a special permit from their National Supervisory Authority.
“The modernization of the airspace by Luftfartsverket shows how air traffic control can help reduce the environmental impact of aviation.","Swedavia and Luftfartsverket are the first in Europe to introduce a new air traffic approach concept. The new concept is commonly referred to as Established on RNP (EoR) and makes it possible for aircraft arriving at Stockholm Arlanda Airport to fly with curved approaches to a greater extent than before. The concept is an important step towards increasing the capacity, efficiency and sustainability of air traffic.

“For us, it is of course gratifying that Swedavia will be the first in Europe to apply the new concept for managing arrivals. Enabling more curved approaches is also the most effective way to support airlines in their transition work, in addition to facilitating increased use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF),” says Susanne Norman, Director of Operations at Swedavia.

The new approach concept allows the airport to increase the landing rate per hour and reduces emissions, both for the aircraft flying the shorter, curved approach and for those flying the standard instrument landing approach. This is because fewer aircraft have to use the runway dedicated for arrivals, reducing the queue for that runway. To be able to fly curved approaches, airlines must have a special permit from their National Supervisory Authority.

“The modernization of the airspace by Luftfartsverket shows how air traffic control can help reduce the environmental impact of aviation. The traffic flow into Stockholm Arlanda Airport becomes more efficient during peak hours, and arriving aircraft have shorter flight paths with reduced emissions, says Anna Granberg,” Director of Operations at Luftfartsverket.

“We are very pleased with the initiative from Swedavia and the Swedish Air Traffic Control Provider (LFV) to implement new procedures that will increase the number of curved approaches (RNP AR – Required Navigation Performance, Authorization Required) at Arlanda. We would like to commend them for this effort and for the excellent cooperation we have had throughout the project. Shorter approaches result in lower fuel burn and reduced emissions. Our goal is to reduce emissions by 30 percent by 2030, and more efficient flight operations like this are among our top priorities — alongside increased use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and continuous fleet renewal, says Charlotte Holmbergh,” Country Director Corporate Affairs at Norwegian.

“SAS welcomes all initiatives that help reduce fuel consumption, noise, and emissions. The introduction of the new approach concept is a step in the right direction towards a more efficient and more sustainable airspace around Arlanda,” says Alexandra Lindgren Kaoukji, Head of External Communication & PR at SAS.

As a global leading figure in aviation, their actions definitely set as a role model to pushing other airlines in the industry to adapt to the new trend of fuel consumption.",https://i0.wp.com/travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/download-3.jpeg?fit=2216%2C1477&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-22 02:56:58.497920

This paper argues that rising aviation emissions, which are disproportionally driven by the wealthy, pose a serious threat to climate goals. Using the UK’s Jet Zero strategy as a case study, it explores how policymakers and industry promote speculative technologies—efficiency gains, electric and hydrogen aircraft, sustainable aviation fuels, carbon capture, and offsetting—to justify continued aviation growth. We critically assess these claims: electric aircraft are limited to short routes; hydrogen faces major storage and infrastructure barriers, and green hydrogen remains scarce. SAFs, often derived from land-intensive crops, risk deforestation, biodiversity loss, and higher net emissions. Second generation SAFs, such as used cooking oil, are scarce, and power-to-liquid is speculative and prohibitively expensive. Carbon capture is unproven at scale, and offsetting enables airlines to claim reductions without cutting actual emissions. These “solutions” align with a political agenda that prioritises economic growth and airport expansion. We argue that this techno-optimism delays real action. Rather than gambling on future breakthroughs that may never materialise, policymakers should pursue immediate demand-reduction strategies and support a just transition—ending frequent-flyer incentives, shifting short-haul flights to rail, removing aviation fuel subsidies, and retraining workers for low-carbon sectors.

Introduction: aviation and the climate crisis

It is no longer necessary to watch a Hollywood movie to imagine what a climate disaster might look like; glancing at the newsfeed will often suffice.Footnote1 2024 was the hottest year on record, and the first to exceed 1.5°C warming above pre-industrial levels. It brought catastrophic flooding to West Africa and Valencia, and drought to southern Africa. In southern California, where a perfect tinderbox had been created by extreme wet-then-dry conditions known as hydroclimatic whiplash, the start of the new year saw wildfires wreak havoc (Kolbert, Citation2025). 2025 also saw destructive floods in Pakistan, Colombia, Venezuela, northern China and Texas, while in Britain many crops failed due to drought. Climate breakdown is proceeding more quickly than previously anticipated (Hansen et al., Citation2025). We are, warns UN secretary-general António Guterres, on the ‘highway to climate hell’ (United Nations, Citation2024). And climate is only one among many vectors of environmental breakdown. ‘Planetary boundaries’ are being crossed at a rate of knots – seven out of nine at the latest count (Gayle, Citation2024).

Against this backdrop, the need to rapidly decarbonise could not be more pressing. Britain is currently off track to meet its target of ‘net zero’ by 2050 (CCC, Citation2024), and three quarters of its primary energy still comes from fossil fuels (Energy Institute, Citation2025). Nowhere is the scale of the deficiency clearer than in aviation. According to the 7th Carbon Budget of the Climate Change Committee (CCC), an advisory body to the British government, in 2023 UK aviation emissions were 69% higher than in 1990; they account for 8% of UK emissions, with international flights the principal driver of expansion (CCC, Citation2025, p. 222).

In this paper, we scrutinise aviation decarbonisation strategies, with Britain’s Jet Zero plan as the case study. We read Jet Zero as a gamble predicated on a series of technologies and policies that are highly unlikely to achieve their goals. We assess the prospects for electric and hydrogen aviation, efficiency savings, carbon capture and storage, offsets, and sustainable aviation fuel. We then tease out the implications for policy.

Our focus is on Britain, due in part to its historic responsibility for the climate crisis. In cumulative CO2 emissions Britain ranks eighth in the world, but if we factor in its empire (ruled from London) the position is higher, and it reflects Britain’s pivotal role in the dissemination of fossil-fuel use worldwide (Evans & Rydén, Citation2005; Ritchie & Roser, Citation2020). Against this fossil-imperial backdrop, Britain’s Nationally Defined Contribution (NDC) to reducing emissions falls short of an equitable share (Civil Society Equity Review, Citation2023; Gabbatiss, Citation2023). In part, too, our focus on Britain relates to its legal commitment to a target of ‘net zero’ by 2050, following a law passed in 2008 when Labour’s Ed Miliband was Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change. Ever since, it has positioned itself as a ‘climate leader’ (DESNZ & Miliband Citation2024). The increasing climate-impacting significance of aviation and the role the sector plays in the government’s vision for making Britain ‘the world’s best-connected place to do business’ makes its ‘Jet Zero’ programme an exemplary lens through which to study the friction between ‘growth’ and sustainability (Stewart, Citation2025b).

Jet Zero was set up under Boris Johnson’s premiership, the declared aim being to steer the aviation industry toward ‘sustainability’. With particular clarity that programme manifests the ‘technological solutionism’ and ‘technofixes’ that dominate policymaking on decarbonisation, and above all on aviation. Technofixes refer to questionable claims regarding what technology can achieve in order to reduce the pressure to address social and ecological problems in other ways. There are obvious reasons that governments succumb to this way of thinking (e.g. line of least resistance regarding potentially unpopular behavioural change) and obvious attractions for corporations in propagating it (the camouflage it offers for prioritising profits over the habitability of Earth).

Technological solutionism, similarly, recasts ‘complex social situations either as neatly defined problems with definite, computable solutions or as transparent and self-evident processes that can be easily optimised (Morozov, Citation2013, p. 5). Examples of technological solutionism abound in UK government pronouncements and policies today, be it the programme for ‘a digital health service powered by cutting-edge technology’ as a solution to an ailing NHS, or the quest to make Britain ‘the world leader’ in AI in order to ‘turbocharge growth’ (Department for Science, Innovation & Technology et al., Citation2025; Streeting, Citation2024). Jet Zero is cut from the same cloth. It seeks to sidestep politically difficult questions pertaining to the social purposes of transport, leisure and work, instead reaching for technological trump cards.

Those technofix range from the unproven to the unrealistic to the downright harmful. It is important that we strip back the futurist veneer of the promises and policies of sustainable aviation, debunk the obfuscatory language deployed, and carefully scrutinise the claims made.

We submit that ‘sustainable aviation’ represents a reckless gamble on new technologies, some of which are unproven and many of which are likely to be unscalable. It melds flimsy promises from the aviation industry, in its attempt to pre-empt government intervention, with empty bluster from governments keen to placate a climate-concerned electorate. Ultimately, its function, if not the motivation, is to provide a smokescreen, one that lingers until the current government is out of office, leaving its successors – not to mention human society and other fauna and flora – to face the heat. In short, in Britain, as is largely the case elsewhere, techno-utopian fantasy is writing the official script. The result is a diversion of attention from the practical changes needed, which we shall summarise in the final section.

Jet Zero and aviation emissions

Consultation for Jet Zero began in July 2021 under Boris Johnson’s premiership. It built upon the previous ‘Net Zero Strategy’ and ‘Transport decarbonisation plan’ to chart a course for aviation to reach net zero by 2050 (Department for Transport, Citation2021; HM Government, Citation2021a). With the aim of helping the aviation sector decarbonise, the consultation centred on a Jet Zero Council – ‘a forum bringing together government, industry and academia to speed up change’ (Department for Transport, Citation2022b, p. 4). In July 2022, the Jet Zero strategy document was published. It was constructed chiefly of assumptions and promises borrowed – naïvely, as we show below – from the aviation sector, in particular from the industry organisation Sustainable Aviation, mediated through government-industry partnership bodies (Department for Transport, Citation2022a, Citation2024a). Largely frozen out were climate scientists and the environmental groups and NGOs that seek to protect the interests of Earth and its inhabitants.

A key assumption that the Jet Zero strategy reproduces is that in its emissions calculations and scenarios CO2 emissions are foregrounded. This risks obscuring aviation’s true climate impact. As much as two-thirds of aviation’s global-heating impact stems from non-CO2 emissions and cloud formation. The actual impact of aviation on global heating may be tripled once these non-CO2 emissions are factored in (EUASA, Citation2020; Lee et al., Citation2021). To put this in perspective, a return flight from London to New York, generating one tonne of CO2 per passenger on average, has an actual impact equivalent to around three tonnes (Kommenda, Citation2019). According to the CCC (Citation2020), three tonnes is the total annual level of per capita emissions to which Britain must be restricted by the mid-2030s, if the 1.5C target is to remain even possible.Footnote2 We should also consider military aviation. Aviation makes up a third of the Ministry of Defence’s (MOD) self-reported CO2 footprint, and the MOD accounts for 50% of UK government emissions (Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Citation2024).Footnote3 If we factor in the non-CO2 effects, military aviation alone could account for as much as a third of total UK government emissions. Military aviation emissions are forecast to rise, as Britain increases its military spending in line with the NATO-wide target of 3.5% of GDP. This target, if met, would lead to extra emissions across NATO member states estimated at 1320 million tCO2e over the next ten years – the equivalent of the annual emissions of Brazil (Parkinson, Citation2025).

Rather than exercise caution in a situation where underestimating impacts will generate real effects that cannot simply be ‘taken back’, the government’s response to the question of non-CO2 effects has been ‘wait and see’.Footnote4 It promises to channel some funds into research in the area, while refusing to incorporate any of the existing research into its calculations on the climate impact of aviation (HM Government, Citation2024a). This is short-sighted and self-serving: it frames uncertainty as a reason for current lack of action and misrepresents what the ‘uncertainty’ is telling us. Consider by contrast the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). Although it has been widely criticised for its capture by the aviation industry (Carrington, Citation2025), even it takes care to point out the significant impact of non-CO2 aviation emissions on global heating. Its research shows that non-CO2 emissions’ effects increase alongside the projected growth in CO2 emissions (Lee et al., Citation2023). In other words, these obscured contributions of aviation to climate breakdown will only grow in significance unless the sector’s overall CO2 emissions are reduced.

As noted in the introduction, Jet Zero’s projections point to significant growth in numbers of passengers, flights and distances flown. For example, a 2020 government report projected that by 2050, passenger miles flown will be twice the 2017 figure and six times the 1990 figure (Department for Transport, Citation2020a). The picture is similar in Europe, with the latest figures suggesting that EU air traffic could reach more than 2.3 times the 2019 level by 2050 (T&E, Citation2025). Aviation, by the government’s own admission, is set to comprise fully a quarter of Britain’s GHG emissions by 2050, and will be the industry with the greatest carbon emissions (HM Government, Citation2018; Sustainable Aviation, Citation2020). This means that even if the proposed technofix were to work as promised, in 2050 the sector could be burning as much fossil kerosene as in 2023 (T&E, Citation2025).

Jet Zero and its technofixes: efficiencies, batteries, hydrogen

The Jet Zero report set 2019 as the peak year for aviation CO2 emissions, following which they would decline to 21 million tonnes (Mt) in 2050. At that point, aviation will be ‘net zero’ – assuming that those 21 Mt are captured and stored, or offset. Before we examine the proposals for reaching that goal, it is worth pointing out that airline emissions are already on track to exceed the 2019 peak (Topham, Citation2024). That the plan is already faltering is an early warning of its inadequacy. We predict that it will not get back on track. A key reason is that the strategy assumes that technology can be relied upon to solve the problem. This emulates the strategy of transition to electric vehicles in the road transport sector, but without the proven technologies that that sector can point to.

One prominent technofix is efficiency improvements. These, Jet Zero predicts, will account for a major share of aviation carbon savings by 2050. Such forecasts, however, are based on wishful thinking; the empirical evidence leans strongly against them. According to the International Council on Clean Transport (ICCT) the real-world fuel efficiency of aircrafts – otherwise known as block fuel – increased by 1.3% per annum (pa) between 1960 and 2024 (Hameed & Rutherford, Citation2025; see also Kharina & Rutherford, Citation2015; Zheng & Rutherford, Citation2020). Over the same time period, the metric valueFootnote5 – which measures how efficient an aircraft is technically designed to be – increased by even less: only 1% pa.Footnote6 Almost all of the scenarios developed by major international aviation organisations in the last few years forecast efficiency savings at less than 1% pa (IATA, Citation2024). The 1.4% pa efficiency gain on which Jet Zero relies, Finlay Asher, a former aircraft engine designer at Rolls Royce, told us, is ‘wildly optimistic’. There are ‘no large step-changes in efficiency around the corner and it takes 10–15 years to certify a significant new aircraft and engine design. So, anything we do see in 2035 – e.g. new designs entering service – will not be the predominant aircraft in service in 2050, due to the 20–30 year lifetime of aircraft’.

A deeper problem with efficiency gains are their rebound effects (York et al., Citation2022). Improvements reduce costs which spur demand, leading to more miles flown. According to the CCC (Citation2020), if demand is not constrained, Britain’s aviation industry will grow at an average rate of over 2% pa over the coming decades. While there are different scenarios, there is a shared expectation that numbers of passengers, flights and distances flown will grow (Leggett, Citation2025). Globally, the sector is set to double by 2040, with growth at an average 3.5% pa (IATA, Citation2023). Needless to say, Earth’s systems care little that less kerosene is required per passenger if more in total is being burnt due to air travel’s overall growth (Dobruszkes & Ibrahim, Citation2022).

Other technofix look to alternative fuels. At the inception of the Jet Zero plan, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, identified ‘biofuels and electric aircraft’ as a key focus (Department for Transport, Citation2020b). The model is similar to the electric vehicles (EVs) strategy for road transport: a ‘business as usual’ approach that assumes ever-growing sales, little or no demand management, and a high-stakes gamble on technology. In road transport, the strategy is fraught with problems, not least the emissions from extraction and manufacturing processes, and the capacity of renewable energy production: replacing all vehicles with EVs risks exceeding the global carbon budget (Morgan, Citation2020). But while decarbonising road transport is deeply problematic, it is technically feasible. Adopting a similar strategy for aviation is not simply problematic; it is, at least for the foreseeable future, delusional. Jet Zero’s promotion of electric planes is exemplary in this regard. Shapps’ claim that they offer ‘boundless possibilities’ (Department for Transport, Citation2019) is questionable, given the well-documented challenges they face. Due to the weight of batteries – which, unlike fuel, don’t burn off as you fly and are much less energy dense – electric flights will only be viable for short journeys with few passengers (Walker, Citation2019). The maximum range of the tiny nine-seater prototype ‘commuter plane’ developed by leading firm Eviation is 460 km – about the distance from London to Newcastle (Weitering, Citation2024). These aircraft remain a long way from commercial operation and the past five years for the sector has been a story of delays and tempered expectations (Kaminski-Morrow, Citation2020; Sampson, Citation2025), if not outright insolvency, as in the case of German electric aerospace company Lilium (Westerheide, Citation2025). The industry consensus is that for flights of 1,500 km or longer – which make up 80% of aviation emissions – battery-powered flight is unfeasible (Air Transport Action Group, Citation2021; Pfeifer, Citation2019; Schwab et al., Citation2021). In other words, electric planes are a substitute less for jet planes than for buses and trains: an airborne taxi service for well-heeled travellers seeking to avoid congested roads and trains.

Another technofix promoted by the Jet Zero consultation is hydrogen flight (HM Government, Citation2021b). Hydrogen doesn’t suffer from the problematically low energy density by mass of lithium batteries, but because its energy density by volume is far lower than jet fuel it requires much bigger and heavier onboard storage tanks. Hydrogen planes would also require very extensive modifications to airport infrastructure. The source of hydrogen is another concern. Only one percent is currently ‘green’ – i.e. produced with renewable energy. It is over thrice the price of ‘grey’ hydrogen, which itself is four times as expensive as kerosene (Henderson, Citation2021). Grey hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels, with CO2 released as a waste gas – around 830 million tonnes each year (Pirani, Citation2020). If those emissions are captured and sequestered, the hydrogen is known as ‘blue’. Recent studies warn that blue hydrogen could be worse for the climate even than burning fossil gas, due to methane loss during its production plus the high energy inputs – still, typically, from fossil fuels (Howarth & Jacobson, Citation2021; Schlissel & Juhn, Citation2023).

It is also worth noting that there are corporate and geopolitical pressures behind the push for some technologies over others (Balanyá et al., Citation2020). In Britain, oil companies have strategically misrepresented the costs of blue hydrogen whilst asking the taxpayer for billions of pounds in subsidies (Ambrose, Citation2021). The myth of a green transition to hydrogen-powered aviation serves the interests of states rich in oil and gas deposits and of the fossil-fuel companies that extract them, fearful that their assets will become stranded (Noussan et al., Citation2021). We are not using the word ‘myth’ lightly. Willie Walsh, Director-General of the International Air Transport Association, admits that no long-haul hydrogen flights will be possible until ‘beyond 2050’ (Topham, Citation2021). Airbus has ‘suspended’ its plans to develop hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft, citing ‘slower than expected developments in technology’ (Hepher, Citation2025). Boeing, likewise, sees little potential in hydrogen-powered flight before 2050 (Raymond, Citation2023), and other industry experts forecast the most optimistic date for its long-haul viability as the 2050s or 2060s (Transport Select Committee, Citation2022). Switching to hydrogen, moreover, would require astronomical sums for investments in energy, storage and infrastructure, and could add decades to the ‘net zero’ transition in aviation, according to a CCC spokesperson (Hollinger, Citation2021). Moreover, burning hydrogen releases much more water vapour than the equivalent jet fuel, meaning it would contribute to global heating via contrails (Forster et al., Citation2023). In short, hydrogen is only ‘green’ in prohibitively expensive form, it offers no realistic alternative to kerosene in the near to medium future, and even its medium-term applications are limited to short-haul flights. Green hydrogen production may be ramping up, but often in problematic ways. European-owned green hydrogen projects in north Africa, for example, stand accused of displacing local populations and occasioning serious environmental harms, whilst siphoning off tens of millions of litres of water in areas with high levels of water insecurity. The hydrogen produced is largely exported to Europe, rather than contributing to a green transition locally. These activities, according to a recent report, reflect a broader strategy whereby Europe is externalising ‘the climate costs of its energy consumption’ in ways that entrench ‘extractivist neocolonial structures’ (Greenpeace & MENAFEM, Citation2025, p. 44).

Take off for economic growth?

Jet Zero was the brainchild of a Tory government whose goals for aviation dovetailed with those of the industry itself. This was tacitly acknowledged in the way in which aviation industry representatives referred to government plans. An example was the 2018 reportThe Future of UK Aviation (HM Government, Citation2018), in which the then aviation minister, Liz Sugg, framed the expansion of aviation as a given for future development. The Minister of Transport under Rishi Sunak went further, stating in Parliament that the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate (more on which below) ‘is part of our approach to ensure that the rationing of flights through ‘demand management’ is ruled out’ (Hansard HC Deb., Citation2024).

Expectations that the incoming Labour government of 2024 might take a different tack found support in the fact that its minister for Energy Security and Net Zero was (and at time of writing still is) Ed Miliband, while its prime minister, Keir Starmer, had voted against Heathrow expansion when it had been put to the Commons in 2018. Such predictions were quickly scotched, as environmental considerations found themselves trumped by the economic growth drive, centred on the expansion of energy infrastructure, IT infrastructure (such as data centres), housing, and, of course, aviation.Footnote7 The most vocal growth booster in government, the Chancellor Rachel Reeves, explicitly stated at the 2025 World Economic Forum in Davos that in any conflict between growth and ‘net zero’, the latter ought to come second (Stewart, Citation2025a).

In relation to the Jet Zero plan, then, the new government opted for continuity. It established a Jet Zero Taskforce (Department for Transport, Citation2024b), formed overwhelmingly of the CEOs of aviation companies and oil companies, plus a smattering of representatives from the renewable fuels and carbon capture and storage (CCS) industries (HM Government, Citation2024b). And when the CCC, in its 2024 report to parliament assessing progress towards net zero, reiterated the call for a halt to all airport expansion (2024), the government doubled down on its commitment to increase aviation (HM Government, Citation2024a). The aviation sector responded warmly. Kenton Jarvis, CEO of easyJet, spoke for the industry as a whole when he praised Starmer’s government for its ‘recognition of the importance of aviation and the crucial role it plays as an enabler of economic growth’Footnote8 (Alexander & Reeves, Citation2025).

Under particular scrutiny in this regard has been the decision to support airport expansion, with a third runway at Heathrow already approved, along with a huge extension to City Airport (Department for Transport, Citation2025b). The extra flights would be considerable, potentially increasing from 480,000 a year to 720,000 at Heathrow alone (Leggett, Citation2025). Plans to almost double the capacity of London Luton Airport have been approved by the Transport Secretary – notably going against the recommendations of the Planning Inspectorate, whose report found that the environmental harms of the expansion outweighed the public benefits (Planning Inspectorate, Citation2025). Similar plans to increase the capacity of Gatwick by over 100,000 flights per year have received backing from the Transport Secretary (Topham, Citation2025). Amid protests from environmentalists, and from some prominent Labour supporters such as the ‘eco-entrepreneur’ Dale Vince, the government insists that there is no tension between expanding the aviation sector and meeting its carbon emissions targets. For the former Secretary of State for Business and Trade, Jonathan Reynolds – who, with Reeves, voted in favour of Heathrow expansion in 2018 – airport expansion and decarbonisation ‘go hand in hand’ (‘Today’, Citation2025). But how exactly might this work? Reeves provided the answer. When pressed on why Starmer had completed a U-turn on airport expansion, she invoked the rapid development of sustainable aviation fuels. SAF, she claimed, has become a ‘game-changer’ in the expansion debate – a technological ticket to guilt-free flying (Georgiadis & Pickard, Citation2025).

The government’s message, in short, is that a contradiction no longer exists between its commitments to economic growth and environmental sustainability. A growing aviation industry is compatible with the ‘net zero’ mission, thanks to efficiency gains and technological breakthroughs – in particular in SAFs.

The HEFAlump in the room

That government spokespeople such as Reeves extol SAF as the elixir of sustainable aviation comes as no surprise. As the prospects for electric and hydrogen-fuelled aviation have experienced a series of setbacks in the early 2020s, SAFs have returned to the forefront of debates around decarbonising aviation. On 1 January 2025, the government’s SAF mandate came into force which requires flights to be fuelled by two percent SAF, rising to ten percent in 2030 and twenty-two percent in 2040 (Department for Transport, Citation2024c). The mandate also includes a revenue certainty mechanism for producers, but this is yet to be implemented (Department for Transport, Citation2023). Despite being hailed a ‘game-changer’ by the Chancellor, there are considerable doubts around the sustainability, scalability and efficacy of SAF as an alternative to kerosene. After examining these issues in detail, it will become clear why this central pillar of the plan for sustainable aviation is so flimsy.

First of all, SAF is not ‘green’ in the way one might think. Burning it produces a similar amount of CO2 to kerosene. It is primarily in its production that the GHG savings are factored in. This green arithmetic should be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis, as SAFs have the potential, especially when land use is changed to produce crops for biofuel, to actually increase the net GHG emissions, thereby contributing more to global warming than burning fossil fuels (EUASA, Citation2025). The UK government defines three types of SAF. The first is called HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids) – this is fuel made from animal fats and vegetable oils. The second is non-HEFA biofuels which can be produced from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), alcohol from food crops (‘Alcohol to Jet’ (AtJ)), and from non-food crops, woody crops, and forestry and agricultural waste – this latter group is ‘second-generation biomass’. The third is power-to-liquid synthetic electrofuel (PtL), which is generated using captured carbon and hydrogen (BP, Citation2023; Department for Transport, Citation2024c). Of the three, HEFA is the most established and by far the cheapest of the three methods. However, it has some major downsides, as we shall see, which explains the government’s decision to include a steadily increasing cap on HEFA fuels in its SAF mandate.

The best-known HEFA-using aviation entrepreneur is Richard Branson. In the mid-2000s he arranged for coconut oil to part-fuel a flight from London Heathrow to Amsterdam. The event garnered a burst of media attention, but the sustainability implications were troubling. To have fuelled that short hop with 100 percent coconut oil would have required three million coconuts (Dale, Citation2008). The entire global crop would supply Heathrow for only a few weeks – and it is one of 18,000 commercial airports worldwide. Following this stunt, coconut oil was never used in a Virgin flight again. The Virgin flight drew attention to intrinsic problems of using HEFA. Energy crops such as palm oil or coconuts are not sustainable in any reasonable definition of the term. For energy production they’re a sub-par use of land: solar panels convert solar energy for human-use much more efficiently. In competing with agricultural crops, their downsides are legion (DeCicco, Citation2016). They contribute to GHG emissions from land-use change, and to land-ownership concentration; they cause food price rises, food insecurity, deforestation, peat burning, water shortages, and biodiversity loss. To give but one example, in 2019 alone, the palm oil suppliers to Neste, the world’s largest biofuel producer, were accused of deforesting at least 10,000 hectares and setting 13,000 forest fires (Milieu Defensie, Citation2020). The scale of the potential demand is radically incommensurable with the availability of land to produce biofuel. If 100% of global jet fuel in 2050 were to be produced from SAFs derived from seeds and oilseeds, it would require a staggering two billion acres to grow – five times the cropland area of the United States (Qualman, Citation2024).

Biofuel crops produce GHG emissions in other ways too (Dale, Citation2007). Their inputs include large quantities of energy and fertilisers, a major source of nitrous oxide, as well as hydrogen – largely from fossil gas – for the hydrotreatment of oil (Hughes, Citation2021). Biomass from plantation-grown trees is seen by many in the aviation industry as the new cornucopia, but it suffers from all the same drawbacks. Branson’s proposed solution after the coconut debacle was to pivot to algae, a solution which attracted sizable investment from major oil companies eager to give their polluting activities a green veneer. As a water-based crop, algae appealed in part because it was seen as a way to circumvent the issue of land use change. In 2008 we predicted that algae would not be a viable option (Dale, Citation2008), a forecast that was confirmed a decade and a half later when ExxonMobil was the final fossil-fuel investor to abandon the project (Westervelt, Citation2023).

Used cooking oil: flying on fumes and fraud

Britain’s government is well aware of the significant limitations of HEFA-based biofuels.Footnote9 This is reflected in its decision to impose a cap on HEFA-derived sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is set to fall from 71% in 2030 to just 35% by 2040. It has also ruled out fuel made from food, feed, or energy crops as eligible for designation as SAF (Department for Transport, Citation2024c). Yet even with these measures, the government’s consistently optimistic projections for new technologies fall short of what is needed to meet the SAF mandate. At present, Britain has only one operational SAF facility: the Phillips 66 Humber refinery (USDA, Citation2025).

This helps explain why, as of 2023, a staggering 97% of the UK’s SAF supply came from used cooking oil (UCO). Only 8% of this originated domestically (due to its limited total supply), with the bulk imported from Malaysia and China (Purvis, Citation2025). China, the world’s largest UCO producer, is already struggling to meet demand from Europe and the US, while Malaysia has reportedly exported more ‘used’ cooking oil than it actually produces (Goulding Carroll, Citation2022). These discrepancies have raised serious concerns about virgin vegetable oil being fraudulently mixed into the UCO supply (T&E, Citation2024). If confirmed, some UCO-derived SAF is in significant respects more damaging even than kerosene, especially where palm oil plantations – linked to deforestation – are used to meet the demand.Footnote10 Importantly, even where UCO is authentic (i.e. verified waste rather than virgin oil), it is not only a finite waste resource, for which demand is already outstripping supply, but its environmental cost remains high as it displaces use from other, arguably more important, sectors such as domestic biodiesel and animal feed – which in turn further drives deforestation (T&E, Citation2021b).Footnote11

For sustainable fuel, attention has consequently shifted to other sources. One is CO2 extracted from the air by Direct Air Capture technologies and converted into SAF, also called Power to Liquid (PtL) (Keith et al., Citation2018). This may offer potential in the distant future but currently is far too expensive at £94.50/gigajoule (GJ), compared with the £16/GJ it costs to refine jet fuel from crude oil (IEA, Citation2023b). The process is also extremely energy intensive. It would take 468–660 terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy to replace the ‘UK’s fossil jet fuel consumption’(The Royal Society, Citation2023). To put that into perspective, in 2023 Britain’s total electricity consumption was 266 TWh (Statista, Citation2025).

Other sources include forestry residues – such as bark, branches, and sapling thinnings, municipal and business waste, and industrial offgases – but these are not a serious alternative. They compete with more pressing uses: decarbonising electric power, fuelling ground transport, and Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). Waste and offgases, in contrast, do look potentially promising. In 2021 we spoke to two companies which together have received over £50 million in government funding to construct the first wave of non-HEFA SAF plants – Velocys and Lanzatech (Department for Transport, Citation2025a).

Velocys

Of the 27 million tonnes of waste collected annually by Britain’s councils and businesses, a Velocys representative told us, much consists of water, and recyclable substances such as metals and ‘inerts’. These are removed. The remainder is heated using the Fischer–Tropsch process (Steynberg, Citation2004). Contaminant gases are washed out and what remains, chiefly hydrogen and carbon monoxide, is converted to SAF. The Fischer–Tropsch process is a proven technology that dates back to the 1920s, but questions remain as to whether it is capable of delivering sustainable fuel in sufficient quantities, and in time to achieve the government’s Net Zero target. Several obstacles merit attention.

First, SAF from waste is expensive to produce – at least twice the cost of fossil jet fuel (The Royal Society, Citation2023). Producing fuel to meet the high quality and safety requirements necessary to keep a passenger jet in the air is more complex – and thus more costly – than producing biodiesel for buses, trucks or tractors. This leads to the second problem: the amount of municipal waste available is hugely insufficient. Even if all of the available Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) were converted, it would only meet about ten percent of UK jet fuel demand (The Royal Society, Citation2023). One might reasonably ask if this limited supply would not be better used to meet the needs of land vehicles without viable alternatives in sectors such as agriculture. Third, as with PtL fuels, the energy requirements are prohibitive. Britain is predicted to fall significantly short of its 2030 green energy target – despite having revised this down in December 2024 (Cornwall Insight, Citation2025). Globally, energy-transition investment actually declined in 2024, and currently stands at just over a third of the amount required to reach net zero by 2050(Corradi, Citation2025). There simply is not sufficient surplus renewable energy to warrant its diversion to SAF.

The recent development of SAF production, moreover, does not inspire confidence. None of the Velocys projects have reached commercial production. The promise was that its plant in Immingham would start supplying British Airways in 2024, but the site is still ‘a dusty field, empty but for a blue portable toilet lying on its side’ (Plucinska et al., Citation2025). If it does eventually open, it will presumably draw power from the national grid, fuelled to a very substantial amount by non-renewable energy, seriously denting any green credentials it may have had (NESO, Citation2025). On top of this, its direct GHG emissions will be considerable. Over its entire lifetime including combustion, SAF from municipal solid waste produces up to two thirds as much CO2 as fossil kerosene (The Royal Society, Citation2023).

In short, Velocys, like most alternative SAF projects, has not demonstrated commercial-scale viability and there are strong grounds for scepticism. Its case is not atypical. According to a Reuters investigation, of the 165 SAF projects announced by airlines worldwide over the past 12 years, only ten have produced commercial quantities of fuel (Plucinska et al., Citation2025). The oil giant Shell has scrapped construction of its SAF plants in Singapore and in Rotterdam (Almeida, Citation2025). In Britain, there are two other proposed MSW-to-SAF projects, both of which have received government funding (Department for Transport, Citation2025a). One, from the American firm Fulcrum, was set to be twice the size of Velocys’ Immingham facility. However, when their flagship plant in Nevada – the first of its kind – was finally opened after years of delays, it was beset by a multitude of problems including nitric acid corrosion of pipes, massive nitrous oxide emissions and a huge overestimation of the amount of fuel it would actually be able to produce (Howard, Citation2024). The fiasco ended with Fulcrum filing for bankruptcy in 2024 (Hussain, Citation2024). According to research by Andrew Rollinson, most large-scale commercial gasification plants fail. The technology, he notes, ‘has high risks associated with multiple pathways for fire, explosion, and the release of environmental toxins’ (Rollinson, Citation2018). Even if we were to set aside the criticisms of the technology raised above, there is little reason to believe that Velocys’ project will be the kind of success story the government is hoping for.

Lanzatech

LanzaTech’s core technology is ingenious: Clostridium bacteria combine carbon monoxide and hydrogen to produce ethanol, for conversion into jet fuel (AtJ). Its ideal locations are blast furnaces, the offgases of which include carbon monoxide and hydrogen. LanzaTech anticipated that its facility adjoining the Port Talbot steelworks would yield 80,000 tonnes of fuel annually. Although this sounds impressive, we learned from a LanzaTech representative that it represents ‘0.6 percent’ of Britain’s jet fuel usage. As steel production shifts away from fossil fuels in pursuit of its net zero goals, moreover, the supply of those offgases will dwindle – and indeed the last blast furnace in Port Talbot closed in 2024. Hence, LanzaTech has had to look beyond the steel industry, but the feedstocks they have found contain little or no hydrogen, which must then be manufactured. They are exploring DAC-to-SAF projects, but here, again, the energy needs are colossal, and the bottleneck is the availability of renewable electricity.

Other possible feedstocks would include forestry waste, which we discussed above, as well as sources of ‘second-generation bioethanol’, such as straw. These too face many competing uses, the available quantities are low, and the jet fuel would be expensive – perhaps two to four times dearer than kerosene. LanzaTech’s CEO, Jennifer Holmgren, notes that using recycled CO2 or CO costs far more than refining oil, and bringing the cost curve down could take ‘30 or 40 years’ (Gertner & Payne, Citation2021). Production cannot, needless to say, be scaled up at will: it takes three years, at minimum, to get a plant up and running, and only then can the efficiency improvements be transferred to future projects. Construction of LanaTech’s plant was due to commence in winter 2024, but this deadline was missed. The company hopes to begin production in 2026, but notes that this timeline is ‘subject to securing the legislation, investment and off-take agreements that are needed to move forward to a final investment decision’ (LanzaTech, Citationn.d.; Smith, Citation2025).

The aviation industry knows that synthetic fuels cannot be ramped up quickly. As to SAFs in general, in Britain, as the Sustainable Aviation group admits, annual production of 600 kt won’t be achieved until the mid-2030s at the earliest. Even the lowest usage scenario it envisages ‘would exceed globally available waste oils and fats’ and would require ‘substantial new volumes of oil crops’ (Sustainable Aviation, Citation2020).

Carbon capture and storage

Even if one were to set aside scepticism regarding the technological assumptions underpinning the Jet Zero strategy – to accept, for instance, that fuel efficiency will improve at an unprecedented rate, that electric and hydrogen aircraft will overcome existing technical and financial barriers to constitute a meaningful share of the fleet, and that SAFs can be scaled commercially without inflicting further ecological harms – the framework remains fundamentally reliant on negative emissions technologies. This reliance persists even under the most optimistic scenarios, raising critical questions about the feasibility and integrity of the Jet Zero pathway.

By 2050, the Jet Zero strategy anticipates that approximately 21 MtCO₂ will need to be removed annually for the aviation sector to achieve ‘net zero’. (The Sustainable Aviation group (2020) projects an even higher figure, estimating that at least 26 MtCO₂ will need to be either offset or removed each year; and the CCC (Citation2020) suggests that aviation will require around 40% of the UK’s total negative emissions capacity by mid-century.) This raises serious ethical concerns regarding the allocation of limited carbon removal resources to a sector characterised by extreme inequality in access and impact. Globally, just 1% of the population is responsible for half of all aviation emissions (Niranjan, Citation2025), while only 2–4% of people fly in any given year (Gössling & Humpe, Citation2020). In the UK, the disparity is equally stark: 15% of the population accounts for 70% of flights, and half of the population does not fly at all in a given year (Hopkinson & Cairns, Citation2021). Moreover, the wealthiest 10% of Britons generate more emissions from aviation alone than do the poorest 20% from all their activities combined (Baltruszewicz et al., Citation2023). Citizens of the Global South, meanwhile, typically take between zero and one flight per year. The disproportionate allocation of financial and carbon budgets to what is effectively a luxury activity for the affluent raises serious questions of environmental justice and equity.

Even if we leave morality to one side, there remain significant doubts regarding the storage capacity for CCS, and the yawning gap between the diminutive scale of monitored and verified carbon removal and the gargantuan scale required for the Jet Zero sums to add up (de Coninck & M. Benson, Citation2014; Ketan, Citation2021). There are currently forty-one CCS facilities in the world, of which 82.5% are used to aid the extraction of oil in mature wells (Zero Carbon Analytics, Citation2024). In most countries, CCS is unregulated. Those forty-one plants are expensive, potentially dangerous, and are failing to meet their targets (Weyler, Citation2022; Zoledziowski, Citation2022). A recent report on Norway’s Sleipner and Snøhvit pilot plants revealed unexpected behaviour of CO2 in even the most intensively studied of aquifers, a reminder that the danger of leakage is all too real (Hauber, Citation2023). In its most recent roadmap, the International Energy Agencynotes that the history of CCS is one of ‘unmet expectations’ and delayed deployment, that ‘removing carbon from the atmosphere is costly and uncertain’ and that the technology remains ‘unproven at scale’ (IEA, Citation2023a). Its entire efficacy has been called into question by the IPCC, with serious doubts raised over the technology and its claims to carbon neutrality (Robertson, Citation2022; Sekera & Goodwin, Citation2021).

While funding, especially from the polluting industries, should be invested into CCS research and trials, one should also recognise that its primary purpose, today, is as a technofix, built on insecure foundations and geared to short-circuiting difficult political decisions and supporting fossil-fuel giants (Anderson & Peters, Citation2016; Laville, Citation2021; Quiggin, Citation2024). Even the US climate envoy under the Biden administration, John Kerry, admits that CCS risks becoming a dangerous distraction from the need to reduce emissions, while former US vice-president Al Gore dismisses it as ‘an absolute fraud’ (Breeze, Citation2024; Harvey, Citation2023).

Offsets

The solutions discussed so far are vastly overestimated in the Jet Zero programme, manifesting a blasé disregard for scarcities, realistic timescales, and technical obstacles. Yet all are based on technologies that do, or might one day, function. Offsetting, by comparison, is an outright scam. That it is accorded a prominent role in Jet Zero – even in its ‘high ambition’ scenario, offsetting is billed as providing the second-largest ‘reduction’ in emissions, after CCS – is scandalous.

Offsetting is the right to pollute in one location purchased by certificates declaring its reduction in another, relative to ‘business as usual’ – certificates that can then be traded on carbon markets. The logic by which it functions is questionable, to say the least. It’s as if, when a factory poisoning a Malaysian river reduces its pollution ahead of a regulatory deadline, a factory in Liverpool were thereby licensed to discharge mercury into the Mersey. Of carbon offsetting, the great majority relates to protecting areas from future deforestation. Forests, alongside ocean and peatland, are vital carbon sinks that absorb half of human emissions; many of these are losing their ability to absorb carbon (Greenfield, Citation2024; IPCC, Citation2023). Halting deforestation plays, naturally, a vital role in climate change mitigation. But this should not give licence to corporations to continue pumping CO2 into the atmosphere somewhere else (Milman, Citation2018). The carbon credit system into which offset certificates are poured, moreover, is ripe for corruption and fraud (Chan et al., Citation2023). This was made abundantly clear when multiple studies into the world’s largest carbon offsetting certifier revealed that ninety percent of their offsets were utterly worthless (Guizar-Coutiño et al., Citation2022; West et al., Citation2020, Citation2023).

Reforestation schemes may prima facie appear more justifiable, but they too are flawed. Crucially, they fail to take into account the fact that trees are not interchangeable units. Old forest is a complex ecosystem with dense understories; it cannot be ‘replaced’ by plantation silviculture (Monbiot, Citation2021). Moreover, trees take decades to grow and if they are then caught in wildfires for example, they release all the carbon they have been absorbing (Hodgson, Citation2021). People inhabit the places where the offset industry wishes to site plantations. Their fields, livestock and livelihoods are in the crosshairs of carbon offsetting projects. The quantity of land required is staggering – a forest the size of the Isle of Wight would need to be planted every year just to keep up with the carbon footprint of the Royal Air Force (Defence Committee, Citation2023; MoD, Citation2023; Moseman et al., Citation2025). Carbon credits concerned with reforestation and funding renewable energy have been linked to a litany of social and environmental harms. For example, projects connected to Chevron’s carbon offsets include planting rubber monocultures, which are disastrous for local ecosystems and are ineffective at carbon offsetting. A large portion of Chevron’s carbon offsetting schemes involved construction of large hydroelectric dams. These projects would in all likelihood have been constructed anyway, so their status as ‘offsets’ is risible; they have also been accused of undermining local communities, with use of violent methods to suppress resistance (Corporate Accountability, Citation2023). Critics have pointed to the neocolonial and exploitative nature of such relationships (Olúfẹ́mi, Citation2019). Ill-advised if not outright damaging practices of offsetting are taking place in the context of centuries-old unequal relationships of extractivism, sometimes by the very same corporations – as in the case of Chevron in Colombia. We are left with a troubling picture: ineffective carbon offsets threatening food security in the Global South in order to maintain the lifestyles of the world’s frequent flyers (Harvey, Citation2021).

The flaws of reforestation schemes are emblematic of the broader problems with carbon offsetting. These issues are not limited to individual projects but are systemic, as evidenced by the ICAO’s carbon trading scheme, CORSIA. The scheme, which Britain was instrumental in setting up, will account for the majority of the UK aviation sector’s offsets. Beyond the general issues raised above, CORSIA has come under significant criticism from experts. None of the offsetting programmes under the scheme address issues of double counting (where an area of, say, rainforest that was already protected under a national scheme is then counted again for offsetting). Neither do the price mechanisms work, due to oversupply: when buying credits is cheaper than buying SAF, it undermines the incentive to decarbonise. Finally, the entire scheme is beset by a lack of transparency and enforceability (T&E, Citation2021a). That the Jet Zero plan places such emphasis on offsetting seriously undermines its claims to be aiming for ‘net zero’. To repeat: with every fraction of a degree of heating, climate breakdown becomes more severe, unpredictable and irreversible, and the earth’s ecosystems deteriorate further. Carbon offsetting, by giving corporations the green light to continue emitting greenhouse gases, is detrimental to the future habitability of Earth.

Policy proposals

Travelling through an airport in Britain, you might be forgiven for thinking that today’s jetliners are as light as birds. From Gatwick to Bristol, advertisements proudly declare that the airport from which you are taking a flight halfway across the globe is ‘carbon neutral’. Despite the absurdity of such statements being summarily pointed out (Walker, Citation2021), the aviation industry’s attempts to paint a green image of itself are unending. From Ryanair’s banned advertisement that declared it was ‘Europe’s lowest emissions airline’ (ASA, Citation2020) to KLM’s green claims for SAF being ruled ‘misleading’ (Sterling & Plucinska, Citation2024), there are countless examples of aviation-industry ‘greenwashing’. Indeed, a recent study found that 44% of aviation industry publicity regarding carbon offsets was misleading (Guix et al., Citation2022). This is not a new development. ExxonMobil’s 2011 advert promoting biofuel from algae, to give one of many examples, was banned for making similarly dishonest claims (Euractiv, Citation2011). This example is particularly instructive given that the much-vaunted algae ‘solution’ culminated in a dead-end, as we discussed above. The aviation industry has a history of deliberately misleading the public in order to justify its unhindered expansion. To do this it relies on exaggerated, unrealistic and disingenuous claims put forward for a slew of technofix. However, it does not act alone. Obliging governments and compliant media organisations should be held accountable too.

Considering the body of research surveyed in this article, it is evident that the Jet Zero plan prioritises the wellbeing of the aviation industry over the environment. Were the habitability of the planet its driving concern, Jet Zero would recommend demand management measures, such as a ban on aviation advertising and frequent flyer programmes, and the removal of tax exemptions on aviation fuel. It would emphasise 2030 targets, not 2050. It would prioritise consultations with young people, environmentalists, and scientists, rather than aviation lobbyists. It would take seriously the Absolute Zero report from Cambridge University’s FIRES research group (Allwood et al., Citation2019). If Britain’s ‘net zero’ target is to be achieved by mid-century, the FIRES engineers have shown, the aviation industry ‘faces ‘rapid contraction’. This entails the phasing out of ‘all aviation activity’ within 30 years’, with the mothballing of all British airports except Glasgow by 2030, and Heathrow too by 2050 – and only then, if the necessary technologies and sufficient renewable electricity come onstream, could some reopening plausibly begin.

The case for aviation contraction is unlikely to be universally popular, and won’t be a vote winner, unless two conditions obtain. One is a meaningful shift in attitudes to climate breakdown. The other is that transport reforms are linked to proposals that address popular concerns. If campaigners are to bring the aviation industry back down to earth, the vision must be of a habitable planet together with feasible and appealing travel alternatives.

As discussed above, aviation is an elite activity both in the West and worldwide. An opinion survey from 2024 reports that, Rachel Reeves’ pronouncements notwithstanding, the British public does not see aviation growth as essential to economic growth, supports taxation of aviation fuel and raising ticket prices, and ‘strongly supports’ equalising the cost of train travel versus air travel – even if this requires higher taxes on aviation (Chapman, Citation2025b). While jet owners represent 0.0008% of the global population, in Britain private jets represent one in ten flights taking off (Collins et al., Citation2023; Vaughan, Citation2023). A passenger on a private jet travelling from New York to Washington DC – the same distance as London to Paris – is responsible for around 45 times the emissions of a passenger flying the same route on a commercial flight, and 1,100 times one travelling by train (Collins et al., Citation2023). The case for banning private jets, in short, is overwhelming. Business travel should be shrunk, too. The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated that much of it can be replaced by online meetings. If even just those business trips deemed ‘unnecessary’ were curtailed, Heathrow’s traffic would, at a stroke, shrink by nearly a fifth (Statista, Citation2023). Meanwhile, a frequent-flyer levy could equitably reduce demand – without punishing once-a-year holiday goers – during the period in which alternatives to flying are rolled out. Such levies are popular among the British public (Chapman, Citation2025b), and should be imposed with particular priority on the luxury-ticket classes (first, premium, business), for these, while by far the most environmentally damaging, face relatively low taxation under Air Passenger Duty. Alongside the redirection of fossil fuel subsidies, these tax revenues could also provide ‘innovative sources of finance’ to provide ‘Loss & Damage’ assistance to populations most adversely affected by climate breakdown, on the basis of the polluter pays principle (Amnesty International & CIEL, Citation2022).

Beyond these reforms, short-haul and domestic flights should be rapidly phased out. A first step has been taken by France, with its prohibition on flights covering routes that could be travelled within 2.5 hours by train.Footnote12 Again, evidence suggests these policies are popular, with one EU-wide survey finding that two in three Europeans would support a ban on short-haul flights to destinations that could be reached in twelve hours by train (Garton Ash et al., Citation2020). To replace short-haul flights, investment in rail and battery-electric coach infrastructure could enable reliable and accessible public transport for all, at affordable prices or even free. Within Europe, night trains present a viable and convenient substitute and should be revived and upscaled. Surveys consistently demonstrate that people prefer train journeys to flying (Carn & William, Citation2021). Where rail offers a viable alternative, such as between London and Paris, we see passenger demand for aviation collapsing (Rowland, Citation2019). Cruising at a modest 125 mph, a train from London could, with stops, reach Barcelona in eight hours, Ankara in twenty.

The challenge of addressing emissions from long-haul flights remains particularly complex. Alternatives are less readily available than for short-haul travel, yet their significance is greater. A study of flights departing from 31 European countries revealed that those exceeding 4,000 km constituted only 6% of total departures yet were responsible for 47% of total fuel consumption. Similarly, a global analysis found that just 5% of flights – those longer than 3,000 km – accounted for nearly 40% of total aviation fuel consumed (Dobruszkes et al., Citation2024).

To date, there appear to be no viable proposals for long-haul aviation that simultaneously meet ecological sustainability criteria, uphold social equity, and remain politically feasible. What is certain, however, is that a single return long-haul flight from Britain can exceed an individual's entire annual per capita carbon budget, assuming adherence to the 1.5°C climate target. In this context, substantial reductions in long-haul air travel appear to be the only ecologically defensible course of action. While such measures may face resistance, the imperative to remain within the boundaries of a stable planetary system must surely take precedence. The alternative is to risk pushing the Earth system into a state incompatible with the complex societal structures developed over the past five millennia. As Al Gore aptly stated, ‘the maximum that is politically feasible, even the maximum that is politically imaginable right now, still falls short of the minimum that is scientifically and ecologically necessary’ (McKibben, Citation1995).

The absence of clear alternatives to long-haul aviation should not be used to justify the continuation of current practices. That said, we can take inspiration from the slow travel movement (Kieran, Citation2013). If legislation encouraged flexibility from employers, slow-moving zero-emission ships could offer an alternative for some long-distance journeys (Neale, Citation2021). And airships – we venture tentatively, aware that we may be afflicted by the techno-utopianism that this article cautions against – may offer an additional low emissions alternative to aeroplanes (Hall, Citation2024; Jolly, Citation2025).

All these initiatives, whether night trains, ships or airships, would create new jobs, for which workers departing the aviation industry should, in a ‘just transition’, be given priority. A report commissioned by Possible found that if British aviation shrank by two-thirds, around 200,000 jobs would be lost, but by replacing these journeys with alternatives (e.g. trains and ferries), together with the resulting growth in domestic tourism, a net gain of over 300,000 jobs would result (Meadway, Citation2022).

The ‘just transition’, as has been widely observed, is a contested concept. We follow Stefania Barca in her attempt to reclaim the just transition strategy from a simple jobs campaign yoked to a ‘green growth’ agenda, to a programme that, while centred on trade-union mobilisation for ‘green jobs’, simultaneously draws upon ‘Indigenous knowledges’ and advocates for disinvestment from the fossil fuel and nuclear sectors, coupled with energy democracy and food sovereignty at the community level (Barca, paraphrased in Rainnie & Snell, Citation2024, p. 38). International solidarity would be close to its heart; the risks of reinforcing neo-colonial and extractivist relationships with the Global South in the pursuit of ‘green’ policies are well documented (Abram et al., Citation2022; Ambrose, Citation2024; Bell, Citation2024; Hamouchene & Sandwell, Citation2023; Okpanachi et al., Citation2022).

As an embryonic example of a ‘just transition’ in aviation, consider the case of ‘A Green New Deal for Gatwick’. It was convened by eco-socialists and union officials from the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), a union that has been at the forefront of campaigning and policy work on ‘climate jobs’ and the just transition (Lethbridge, Citation2024), during the Covid-19 pandemic when aviation workers were facing mass layoffs. We asked Robert Magowan, one of the proposal’s instigators, what lay behind the Gatwick plan. ‘We know that aviation must degrow’, he replied, ‘and it was degrowing during the pandemic, but this must not come at the cost of workers. The pandemic response showed what governments can do when pressure is on – especially when the Broughton manufacturing site of Airbus was retooled to produce ventilators’.

Magowan and his colleagues surveyed the manifold ways in which Gatwick workers’ skills sets could be adapted to jobs elsewhere, in decarbonising industries. With PCS backing, they found support among the workforce, including from a pilot whose words eloquently sum up what is at stake:

It has been my lifelong dream to fly. To face up to losing this massive part of our lives is incredibly scary; to lose our job is like losing a part of ourselves. But as pilots, we use our skills to identify this existential threat to the natural world and our lives. If this was an emergency in flight, we would have diverted to a safe destination long ago. We can’t just fly blindly to the planned destination as the flight deck fills with smoke. Our industry’s impact on global emissions is irrefutable. The so-called solutions to ‘green’ the industry at its current scale are decades away and are not globally or ecologically just. With environmental consciousness rising, the aviation sector will either shrink by design, through a ‘Just Transition’ for workers, or by disaster. We must find a way to put workers at the forefront of the green revolution, to ensure we have the option to be retrained into the green jobs of the future (Latif et al., Citation2020, p. 24).

A just transition of this kind could have numerous positive impacts on local communities. €4 million is lost every hour by European governments because aviation is untaxed (T&E, Citationn.d.). This aid received by airports and the aviation industry could be redirected to fund local leisure and sustainable transport infrastructure. Even redundant airports could be transformed into community hubs, museums, or green spaces (as was done at the former Berlin airport at Tempelhof) (Magowan, Citation2022).

Conclusion

The Jet Zero plan, with its reliance on unproven technofix and industry-friendly policies, exemplifies a complacency that has underpinned climate inaction for decades. It not only fails to address the scale of the aviation sector’s contribution to the climate crisis, but risks exacerbating it. Its techno-solutionism would have us believe in the alchemical power of new technology: it can turn carbon into gold. But the evidence is clear: carbon capture and storage, sustainable aviation fuels, hydrogen-fuelled and battery-electric planes are not the silver bullets they are made out to be, and offsetting is a farce. These proposals serve chiefly as window dressing for the aviation industry, an alibi to provide cover for unchecked expansion while delaying the difficult decisions needed to mitigate global heating.

As the mercury continues to rise, governments, rather than working urgently to reduce aviation emissions, are placing their bets on yet-to-materialise technologies (Schleussner et al., Citation2024). The airlines, hand in glove with policymakers, are using these ‘solutions’ to carve out space to expand their operations. If such solutions, however, are false promises, as this paper argues, the aviation industry ought to be scaled down, and permitted to re-grow only if the lifecycle of aircraft can be designed to avoid GHG emissions entirely. The methods necessary to curb aviation emissions exist; what is lacking is the political ambition to implement them. They includes policies to equitably reduce demand for air travel, and investment in sustainable alternatives, with measure to ensure a just transition for workers and communities dependent on the aviation industry. The flaws of governmental responses to the Covid-19 pandemic notwithstanding, they hinted at the rapid, transformative change that can occur where the political will exists.

For the rising global temperature to be stabilised at 1.5°C, high-emissions industries must be rapidly reined in. This requires not only a radical reassessment of how we travel, but also structural transformations, with respect to the logics of economic growth and the goals of social justice and the habitability of the planet.

1 For suggestions and comments on an earlier draft, we wish to thank Jamie Morgan. The usual caveat applies.

2 The CCC acknowledges the problem: ‘Aviation’s non-CO2 effects refer to the additional climate impacts from aviation not due to GHG emissions, such as line shaped contrails, high cloud increases, and the impacts from air pollution. Since 1990, the warming effect of non-CO2 effects has tripled’. (CCC, Citation2025, p. 223).

6 Average measures of fuel efficiency conceal substantial variation across periods. During the late 1960s, the replacement of first-generation with second-generation jets yielded significant efficiency improvements (5.6% annually in block fuel and 3.7% in MV). By contrast, from the 1990s through the early 2010s, the absence of major technological advances resulted in near-zero gains. The introduction of more efficient aircraft types in the 2010s, notably the Boeing 787, produced improvements of up to 3.5%. However, efficiency growth stagnated again in the early 2020s (Hameed & Rutherford, Citation2024). That average fuel efficiency has struggled to climb substantially above 1% pa is confirmed by the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO) which in 2019 admitted that while they aspire to efficiency gains of 2% pa, “today’s aircraft are approximately 80 per cent more efficient in use of fuel per passenger kilometre than that in the 1960s” – in other words around 1.1%pa (ICAO, Citation2019).

7 Recent research suggests that the energy demands of data centres may already exceed, globally, the electricity produced by renewables (Castro et al., Citation2024). This should be of concern to the Starmer government, given its commitment to a breakneck expansion of data centres (Gross et al., Citation2025).

8 It is important to point out that even if we were to put aside the environmental and social costs of airport expansion, its contributions to growth are debatable. A recent report carried out by the New Economics Foundation found that as expansion primarily increases outbound passengers, it is “highly unlikely” that it offers “any growth benefits to the UK” (Chapman, Citation2025a). And in an extensive analysis of the economic case for the expansion of Leeds Bradford Airport, a report found that it would in fact lead to a net loss for the region’s economy (Chapman & Postle, Citation2020).

9 The EU’s SAF mandate suffers from similar problems. Based on the projections of Boeing and Airbus, emissions savings from the EU’s 42% SAF mandate will be cancelled out by growth, with CO2 emissions in 2049 predicted to be just slightly lower than their 2019 level (T&E, Citation2025). However, given the low forecast for the availability of efuels, like Power to Liquid (PtL), we infer that a hefty portion of that SAF demand will be met by HEFA-based biofuel or similarly unsustainable sources. If this is accounted for then European aviation emissions would likely rise to a peak in 2049 (T&E, Citation2025).

10 Despite knowing of the concerns regarding authenticity of the oil, the British government has excluded SAF from its investigation into Chinese biodiesel imports (Hussain, Citation2024). Instead, it relies on industry-led certification schemes like the International Sustainability and Carbon Certificate to verify authenticity. These schemes depend heavily on self-reporting rather than independent verification, casting doubt on their reliability (Greenpeace, Citation2021).

11 In the UK, biodiesel is primarily used for road transport (DEFRA Citation2025), as well as agricultural machinery, and power generators.

12 Despite France’s ability to whisk passengers across vast distances in under 2.5 h thanks to its extensive high-speed rail network, Britain still sees multiple daily flights on routes that are easily covered by train. From London, you can reach all the major northern cities in less than 2.5 h. And yet, there are still around five flights a day from London to Newcastle, and a similar number to Manchester.",https://covers.tandf.co.uk/og/RSOC.png,N,,2025-10-21 23:56:10.048208

Dent said this won’t be the last word on how the climate law affects the bottom line of ag businesses.","Washington quietly ended funding this summer for a program that provided millions of dollars in rebates to farmers who paid unfair fuel surcharges under Washington’s landmark climate law.

Lawmakers are hoping instead that legislation enacted in May will make it easier for farm fuel users and haulers of agricultural goods to receive the fuel exemption promised under the state’s cap-and-trade system.

This year’s law directed the Department of Ecology to create an online map of retailers who sell exempt agricultural fuel at a price that excludes any surcharges associated with the Climate Commitment Act.

Rep. Tom Dent, R-Moses Lake, said this will simplify the process for farmers and haulers. Rather than pay a surcharge and submit paperwork to the government for a rebate, they can avoid extra costs up front, at the pump, he said.

“This should be an easier way for farmers to not pay a surcharge,” Dent said.

Complicated carveout

Central to the Climate Commitment Act are auctions for pollution allowances that refineries and other companies need to buy to offset their carbon emissions.

Under the law, the agricultural, maritime and aviation sectors are supposed to be exempt from the law’s cap on emissions and any fees fuel companies might pass to customers to cover the cost of buying the allowances. Fuel used for trucking crops and other agricultural goods on public highways is exempt as well.

Soon after the cap-and-trade program began in 2023, complaints about these exemptions started streaming in.

There were difficulties tracking whether diesel fuel was being used for exempt purposes. A process where exempt fuel buyers had to present certificates to fuel sellers was cumbersome and faulty. One challenge for farmers was knowing where fuel exemption certificates would be accepted.

Bottom line, farmers and truckers said fuel distributors were, in many cases, passing on the cost of allowances to the tune of as much as 70 cents a gallon.

Ecology put together a workgroup that met several times in 2023 to try — unsuccessfully, said farmers and truckers — to iron out the wrinkles.

Even before the panel completed its work, the Washington Trucking Associations and the Washington Farm Bureau were asking a judge to scrap Ecology regulations guiding the exemptions and to open a new rulemaking process.

That fight reached the state Supreme Court this week.

Funding left out of budget

In 2024, the Legislature set aside $30 million for rebates to farm fuel users and transporters of agricultural goods who could show they paid a surcharge tied to the climate law for which they should have been exempt. The Department of Licensing ran the Agriculture Support Program with funding from Climate Commitment Act proceeds.

It launched in August 2024 and ended June 30 this year.

Farmers and transporters could seek rebates for fuel purchased between Jan. 1, 2023, and Dec. 31, 2024. A total of 2,744 applications came in, with $7,887,820 in rebates awarded, according to the Department of Licensing. There were rebate recipients in each of the state’s 39 counties.

Overall, the department spent $9.4 million on the rebate program, with the remaining $20.6 million returned to the climate fund.

Dent said he wanted the rebate program to continue, “but budget writers being budget writers decided not to do so.”

House Bill 1912, which Dent authored this year, says it is the intent of the Legislature to extend the rebate program through the 2025-27 biennium. That is not what occurred, even though the bill passed by margins of 94-2 in the House and 49-0 in the Senate.

The House penciled in $3 million to keep the program going in its budget, but the Senate put no funds in its version. That is what the Legislature passed and Gov. Bob Ferguson signed.

As a result, applications for rebates closed June 2. All those received were processed, with money sent by June 30.

In the meantime, the Department of Ecology developed the new online directory of retailers who have told the department that they sell exempt agricultural fuel at a price that is different from fuel that is not exempt under the climate law.

This directory lists the name, address, county, and, if applicable, city of each exempt retail fuel seller. If additional retailers self-report, the site will be updated.

Dent said this won’t be the last word on how the climate law affects the bottom line of ag businesses.

—

Airplane travel is one of the most carbon-intensive activities. In 2023, the aviation industry’s carbon emissions reached 950 megatonnes, accounting for 2.5% of the world’s emissions. To address this issue, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has been developed as an alternative to petroleum-based aviation fuel.

As announced in the Hong Kong Policy Address 2025, Hong Kong is eyeing SAF. In this respect, the city is planning to develop a SAF industry chain in cooperation with mainland China authorities, adopt specified SAF consumption targets for flights departing from the Hong Kong International Airport by 2030, and build a SAF blending facility to boost competitiveness.

What Is SAF?

Instead of petroleum, SAF is made from sustainable feedstock such as municipal solid waste, agricultural residues, oils, and fats.

The Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene is one of the most common types of SAF. First, the appropriate feedstock, like wood waste, agricultural residue, and municipal solid waste, will undergo a thermochemical process called gasification. During this process, biomass will first be heated to remove its water content and break its structure into simpler molecules. Then, a chain of chemical reactions will happen under high temperature (above 700) in an environment with limited oxygen. As a result, the biomass will be converted into syngas that primarily consists of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. After removing the impurities, the syngas can be fed into the reactor to produce liquid hydrocarbons by undergoing the catalytic chemical reaction. The liquid hydrocarbons can be used as aviation fuel after refining.

Why SAF?

There are various advantages to adopting SAF in Hong Kong.

First, SAF is a drop-in fuel that can be directly used in current aircraft. It means that there is no impact on the performance, and no modification or extra infrastructure is required.

Depending on the type of feedstock and production methods, SAF can be blended with conventional aviation fuel in a range of 10% to 50%, with lifecycle carbon emission reductions of up to 80% compared with conventional fuel. Using SAF can also improve air quality by lowering emissions of sulfur and particulate matter.

All this makes SAF a great ally in decarbonization efforts globally and in Hong Kong – the city is committed to reducing carbon emissions by 50% compared with the 2005 level by 2035 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.

Developing SAF is also beneficial for businesses. While airlines can reduce the scope one emissions generated by their aircrafts, other companies can also benefit in the resulting reduction of upstream scope three emissions generated by business travel. As a result, these companies can not only lower their carbon footprint but also reduce the risk of financial loss caused by climate change.

As required by the Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing Limited, all listed companies in Hong Kong have an obligation to disclose sustainability-related information – better known as Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards – to the public. Therefore, companies that develop or support SAF can increase their business reputation and attract new investment.

Challenges

Although developing SAF is a good solution to decarbonize aviation, it comes with some challenges.

Currently, the cost of SAF is about two to three times that of conventional aviation fuel. The reason is associated with the limited feedstock supply. Some feedstock, such as crop and virgin oil-based feedstock, may lead to deforestation, land use change, and biodiversity loss. If forests are removed, a massive amount of carbon dioxide stored in the trees will be released back to the atmosphere.

It is also difficult to ensure a consistent supply of feedstocks like solid waste and agricultural residues. This, in turn, means higher production costs. As a result, airlines may continue to use conventional aviation fuel to save costs and avoid increasing ticket prices.

Overcoming these challenges requires detailed planning and supportive policies, such as diversified feedstock and production methods and government subsidies.

Moreover, global SAF adoption is slow. In 2024, global SAF production accounted for just 0.3% of the total aviation fuel production. It is expected to reach 0.7% of total jet fuel production this year.

Without government incentives and leadership, research and development as well as adoption of SAF technology will lag behind, hindering progress of the aviation industry’s decarbonization efforts.

Greenwashing Accusations

SAF has been described as a form of greenwashing – when companies make misleading statements about the environmental impacts of their products as a marketing tactic.

In fact, SAF is a vague term. People with an inadequate understanding may think it is a completely sustainable solution that has zero emissions. Unfortunately, that is far from the truth. During the combustion of jet engines, carbon dioxide will still be released into the atmosphere, even though the lifecycle carbon emissions of SAF are significantly lower. At the same time, air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter will still be emitted, impacting air quality.

Global Trends

Despite slow adoption, multiple countries have implemented rules requiring aviation fuel suppliers to increase blending of SAF with conventional aviation fuel. For example, the United Kingdom introduced a SAF Mandate earlier this year. The requirement will increase linearly, from 2% in 2025 to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040. In the European Union, the ReFuelEU Aviation measure requires a share of SAF in EU airports from this year, which will gradually increase to 70% by 2050. Both mandates have excluded crop and virgin oil-based feedstocks to avoid deforestation, land use changes, and biodiversity loss.

Brazil, the host country of this year’s UN climate change summit, COP30, launched the Belém Commitment for Sustainable Fuels. Announced last week, the initiative aims to quadruple the production and use of sustainable fuels in aviation by 2035. The proposal has won the support from India, Italy, and Japan, and it will be presented at the climate conference in Belém next month.

Scaling Up SAF in Hong Kong

Although Hong Kong does not require airlines to use SAF, Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific has already implemented Asia’s first major SAF program. Launched in 2022, it commits the company to incorporate SAF for 10% of its total fuel consumption by the end of the decade. On October 21, the airline announced a joint investment agreement with Airbus, committing to co-invest up to US$70 million to support the SAF development in Asia and globally.

Under the terms of the partnership, the two companies will work to identify,”evaluate and invest in projects that support the scaling of SAF production towards 2030 and beyond. Projects will be assessed based on their commercial viability, technological maturity, and potential for long-term offtake,” a press release read.

Among the Cathay Pacific SAF program’s partners is Hong Kong’s Airport Authority (AAHK). Its General Manager for Sustainability, Peter Lee, said: “We recognise that SAF is a key solution to decarbonise the aviation sector, and aim to drive uptake at Hong Kong International Airport in the coming years.”

As an international logistics hub, the Hong Kong International Airport has been the world’s busiest international cargo airport since 2010. In 2024, it handled about five million tonnes of cargo and 54.9 million passengers. With such a high flow, it is crucial to develop SAF policy and facilities to demonstrate Hong Kong’s commitment to achieving carbon neutrality and enhancing its global competitiveness and reputation.

Speaking at a conference last October, Cathay’s General Manager of Sustainability Grace Cheung called for more government pressure for Hong Kong’s aviation sector to meet its climate goals.

“Regulators have a key role to play for a level playing field, so that every [player] is doing the right thing for society,” Cheung said, according to the South China Morning Post. “If we leave it to the market, every company will wait for their competitors to make the first move.”

As Hong Kong plans to develop a SAF industry chain and build a SAF blending facility, the production technology will improve and become more cost-effective in the long run. When that happens, airlines will have more incentive to use SAF.",https://earth.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Untitled-design-2021-12-08T165503.159.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 21:16:35.686067

The NFU on Oct. 14 sent letters to President Donald Trump and federal lawmakers urging Congress “to provide immediate economic assistance to support struggling family farmers and ranchers and to make important policy corrections that will help American agriculture in the long-term.”

“Family farmers and ranchers face severe economic challenges and a deepening crisis if they do not receive immediate assistance,” the NFU wrote in the letters. “Recently enacted trade policies and the resulting actions by other countries have wreaked havoc on our markets, driving commodity prices far below the cost of production and significantly impacting once-reliable agricultural export sales. Meanwhile, input costs are projected to reach record levels in 2025. Stress levels are high among farmers, reflected in the rising number of farm bankruptcy filings across the country. The number of farms in the U.S. has been declining for decades, with the loss of more than 140,000 farms, or 7%, from 2017 to 2022. Every farm lost also dramatically impacts the surrounding community and rural economy. Without swift intervention, this trend will only accelerate in the coming years.”

To survive the current cycle of negative profitability, the NFU said aid payments must be directed to family agriculture operations and balanced among regions and crops. The payments must also be subject to meaningful payment limits, and foreign-owned corporations and large, concentrated agribusinesses must be barred from accessing economic assistance, according to the NFU.

NFU is also urging aid to be paired with efforts to investigate monopolies in the agriculture industry and their resulting impact on the farm economy.

In addition, the NFU is stressing that Congress must dedicate resources to developing new, high-value domestic markets for American crops and enhancing existing markets. “Economic assistance must be paired with authorization for nationwide, year-round E15 usage, building toward the use of higher blends of ethanol like E30, as well as increased opportunities for biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel production,” the NFU wrote in the letter.

The goal of this project, according to its leaders, Alex McGowan from Cathay and Anand Stanley from Airbus, will be to help scale SAF towards 2030 and beyond. These two companies will also advocate for supportive SAF policies across Asia, leveraging the region's feedstocks and demand. This deal complements Cathay's recent launch investment in the Oneworld alliance's Breakthrough Energy Ventures SAF fund, by targeting nearer-term, more mature opportunities.

A Deeper Look At This Specific Announcement

Cathay Pacific and Airbus will co-invest up to $70 million to accelerate Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production. This partnership will identify, evaluate, and fund projects designed to support the long-term development of sustainable fuels. Selection criteria for these projects will include commercial viability, technological maturity, and the potential for long-term procurement.

These companies will also collaborate in a way seldom seen in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel space, both on the supply and the demand side of the SAF question. This announcement was made by Cathay's Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer, Alex McGowan, and Airbus President Asia Pacific, Anand Stanley. In a statement seen by Simple Flying, Anand had the following words to share on the matter:

""This agreement reflects the shared commitment of Airbus and Cathay to make a real difference. The production and distribution of affordable SAF at scale requires an unprecedented cross-sectoral approach.""

A Deeper Look At What This Means For Cathay Pacific

From a practical perspective, this deal gives Cathay Pacific earlier, cheaper, and more reliable access to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) while Asia's supply remains nascent. Co-investing with Airbus gives Cathay the ability to influence which plants get built, lock in long-term procurement at negotiable prices, and diversify its access to the fuel across the board in order to help it better comply with emerging blending mandates.

This also helps the airline deepen ties with corporate customers that are looking to reduce their overall carbon footprint and support them with green surcharges and co-funded SAF programs that can defend yields. From a financial perspective, Cathay gets optional upside from project equity in addition to an actionable hedge against future SAF scarcity that could widen cost gaps versus the airline's peers.

From a strategic standpoint, this pairing creates a near-to-medium-term pipeline that creates a barbell across multiple time horizons. The main risks to this are execution, policy lags, or fragmentation in Asian markets, as well as sustained price control over the nascent SAF pipeline in East Asia.

A Deeper Look At What This Means For Airbus

For European aerospace manufacturer Airbus, this partnership achieves three goals. The company is first looking to secure SAF supply for airline customers while strengthening its overall decarbonization narrative. The manufacturer has long wanted to secure its position as one of the industry's leaders in terms of sustainable aviation fuel production. This move opens a repeatable co-investment model that can serve as the groundwork for other partnerships across the region.

By helping finance commercially viable SAF plants, Airbus supports European-style refueling mandates and the reduction of delivery flight emissions, all while helping make the future SAF-ready. This offers more credibility to the manufacturer's Airbus A320neo, Airbus A330neo, and Airbus A350 campaigns. This further deepens the company's ties with Cathay Pacific and other airlines from across the Asia-Pacific region, potentially aiding in sales and service uptake.

From a financial perspective, the manufacturer's equity stake in the matter helps it maintain optionality while hedging SAF scarcity that ultimately could slow overall fleet renewal. Policy collaboration will elevate Airbus's influence on feedstocks and standards. The key risks involved are project delays, policy fragmentation, and returns that trail internal thresholds.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_1835755075-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-21 18:56:10.372197

Projects will be assessed based on the commercial viability, technological maturity, and potential for long-term offtake, according to Cathay's statement.

The partnership also includes collaboration to advocate for supportive SAF policies on both the supply and demand sides across Asia. As Asia has a strong potential in feedstock supply, production capacity, and its vibrant aviation market, the two parties aim to leverage their global experience to help shape policies that make SAF more accessible and affordable in the region.

In addition to its focus on SAF, the group is implementing various strategies to achieve sustainability, including renewing and expanding its fleet with more fuel-efficient aircraft.

Separately, Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan said Hong Kong is committed to taking ""decisive steps"" to develop the SAF industry and promote its use at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA).

Speaking at the Symposium, Chan noted that the event has attracted over 500 participants from around the world, underscoring a shared commitment to achieving a sustainable future for aviation.

Chan said that the government has laid out comprehensive plans to boost SAF development, including initiatives to strengthen supply chains and collaborate with mainland authorities and local enterprises.

With Hong Kong's proximity to mainland China, which boasts significant feedstock availability, the city is well-positioned to lead in SAF production, she added.

Chan also revealed that the government has set a target of achieving a SAF consumption rate of one to two percent for flights departing from HKIA by 2030.

During the meeting, attendees learned about Gevo’s plans to build a sustainable aviation fuel plant on-site, carbon intensity tracking through Gevo subsidiary Verity as well as the potential expansion of the existing bioethanol production plant.

“These public meetings are good,” Richardton Mayor Jesse Aman said to The Dickinson Press afterwards. “The more public meetings we have the more awareness for the project will spread and the more people’s questions will be answered.”

Gevo orginally planned to build a sustainable aviation plant in Lake Preston, South Dakota, even securing a conditional $1.4 billion federal loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy.

However, the Lake Preston site was dependent upon the construction of the Summit Carbon Pipeline. After Summit repeatedly failed to secure the proper state permits from South Dakota, Gevo officials said they began searching for an alternative site.

“We decided to take some of our money and go kind of jump start our production capability by finding a site that would really fit in with our business strategy,” Chris Ryan, Gevo’s president and COO, said during a June interview with The Dickinson Press.

Gevo’s search for an alternative site ended in Richardton. Ryan cited the facility’s existing infrastructure, including its carbon sequestration capabilities and existing ties to the local agricultural community, as reasons for its selection.

Gevo first announced its acquisition of the site in September 2024. Red Trail’s shareholders approved the sale in December of the same year, and the sale closed in February 2025.

During the public meeting, Ryan presented Gevo’s plans to build a sustainable aviation fuels plant to the public.

In an interview with The Dickinson Press prior to the public meeting, he said the plant would create about 50 full-time jobs once operational and several hundred during construction. Ryan said it was too early in the process to confirm an exact cost of construction but put an estimate at about $500 million.

He explained — once operational — the new plant would take the bioethanol produced on-site and convert it into sustainable jet fuels.

Sustainable aviation fuels are a growing industry worldwide. The International Air Transport Association — which represents about 82% of global air traffic — pledged in 2021 to be carbon neutral by 2050. The plan relies on sustainable aviation fuels for 65% of its reductions and carbon capture for 19%.

In addition to Gevo’s plans to produce and sell sustainable aviation fuels , Ryan praised Red Trail’s former owners for investing in carbon sequestration technology and explained the company planned to use the carbon sequestration to obtain and sell carbon credits as an additional revenue stream.

“That was really visionary,” he said during the meeting. “To start that project before it was really clear of the value of these. I need to say from Gevo, there is a lot of value in that carbon sequestration.”

As part of the meeting, Gevo also spoke about its subsidiary Verity’s plans to offer carbon intensity scoring to farmers in the area.

Carbon intensity is a measure of how much carbon dioxide is emitted per unit of economic output — in this case, the unit of measurement would most likely be bushels of corn or growing fields.

Gevo officials explained if they buy corn with a lower carbon intensity score to lower their overall carbon footprint, they are able to get larger carbon credits, potentially leading to more money for local corn growers.

“If you had a lower carbon score, yeah, we could think we could pay you more for your corn,” Ryan said during the meeting. “How much more? I don't know, it depends upon what revenue we might be able to generate from the lower carbon.”

Prior to the meeting, Ryan told The Dickinson Press its purpose was to keep community members informed and to answer their questions or concerns.

“Gevo is committed to growing this plant, and we'd love to have you know the local farmers all come to us to sell us their corn,” he said.

Local community members and farmers were able to ask questions and raise their concerns during the final public participation phase of the meeting.

Several farmers asked if Gevo was considering expanding the existing bioethanol production plant , to which Ryan confirmed the company was. He also said the company was looking into renovating the current facility as well to increase its storage capacity and lower wait times for local farmers dropping off bushels of corn.

One area farmer asked if he would soon be required to acquire a carbon intensity score for his corn to sell it to Gevo. Ryan and other Gevo officials responded he — nor would anyone — be required to do so.

Also present at the meeting was Richardton Mayor Jesse Aman. Aman said he had mostly heard aesthetic concerns about the proposed facility from Richardton residents, such as its appearance, smell and noise.

During the meeting, Gevo answered several such questions regarding aesthetic concerns and assured attendees the new facility would not dramatically disrupt the lives of local residents and the company would do its best to address and resolve any concerns that may arise in the future.

Overall, Aman said he was excited by the prospect of the plant and the opportunities it posed for Richardton.

“I think it’ll be great for the growth of this area and will bring more career opportunities,” he said. “It’ll give our farmers more incentives to grow their crops and help develop our community and the surrounding ones.”

Decarbonizing flight will not happen overnight, but the journey for innovative pathways to create sustainable jet fuel has already taken off. The aviation sector is responsible for about 2.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and in the U.S., approximately 98% of aviation-related emissions result from jet fuel combustion.1,2 This highlights the critical role of fuel decarbonization strategies, with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) being considered among the more feasible options available for reducing emissions from medium- to long-haul flights.3 Governments in the European Union (EU) and UK are pushing this transformation forward by setting mandates for the progressive use of aviation fuel originating from sustainable materials.4 For example, as of January 1, 2025, commercial flights taking off from EU airports must carry at least 2% of SAF in their tanks. By 2030, the mandate requires a minimum of 6% of SAF, including a 1.2% synthetic aviation fuel (eSAF) blend with conventional jet fuel.5 In addition, many airline members of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) have committed to a 10% reduction by 2030, aiming for net zero by 2050.6

The state of SAF. There are two primary categories of SAF: bio-SAF, derived from biomass and eSAF (also known as synthetic or power-to-liquid SAF), produced by combining green hydrogen (H₂) from water electrolysis with captured carbon dioxide (CO₂). These intermediates can be converted into hydrocarbons through several pathways, including Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, methanol-to-jet (MtJ) and alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) processes. Each route upgrades intermediates into jet-range hydrocarbons through a series of catalytic steps, which may include oligomerization, hydrogenation and hydroprocessing to meet jet fuel specifications.7,8 When produced from waste-based feedstocks, SAF can reduce lifecycle CO₂ emissions by up to 80%–90% compared to conventional jet fuel, depending on the production pathway.9

Today, SAF deployment faces investment barriers. Cost estimates indicate that SAF is 2─10 times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, depending on the feedstock and conversion technology used, largely due to high capital expenditure (CAPEX) for early-stage facilities, limited economies of scale and the expense of green H2 for eSAF pathways.10,11 While SAF is technically mature and scalable, achieving cost competitiveness will require coordinated investment, supportive policy and continued innovation across the value chain.12

Moreover, feedstock availability is limited. The Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) projects global SAF demand could reach 330 MM metric t (MMt)–450 MMt by 2050; however, production is only a fraction of this target.13 For example, Neste (an SAF producer) produces approximately 1.5 MMtpy,14 while Spanish energy company Moeve delivered 14,400 metric t of SAF in 2024 and aims to scale to 800,000 metric tpy by 2030 through a second-generation biofuels plant in Huelva, Spain.15 These figures underscore the scale-up challenge and the need for coordinated policy, investment and technology development to close the gap between capacity and future demand.

While there is a massive SAF market on the rise, the limited availability of waste-based feedstock makes it difficult to meet alternative fuel mandates with bio-based SAF alone. This opens the need for eSAF, made with green H2 and captured biogenic CO2, which is a byproduct of many industrial processes.

Different pathways and types of SAF. The production of SAF can follow many different, and often interconnected, routes. Each pathway has its own feedstocks, conversion processes and advantages, but together they highlight the opportunities and challenges of scaling SAF for global aviation.

Bio-SAF. Bio-based SAF is derived from renewable feedstocks such as used cooking oil, animal fats, forestry byproducts and organic waste. While these feedstocks support multiple conversion pathways, including hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), AtJ and gasification-based routes, their global availability is limited. According to ICF (consulting firm) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) analyses, bio-based feedstocks will only be sufficient to supply approximately 50% of the SAF required by 2050 to meet the aviation sector’s net-zero targets.16 HEFA, the dominant commercial pathway, is projected to contribute less than 10% of total SAF volumes by 2050 due to feedstock constraints.17 Current bio-based SAF costs range from €1,600/t─€2,500/t, compared to approximately €700/t for fossil jet fuel.18 These structural limitations make it clear that bio-based SAF, while essential, must be complemented by synthetic alternatives such as power-to-liquid fuels to achieve net-zero targets.

eSAF. eSAF combines captured CO₂ with green H2 from renewable-powered electrolysis to produce synthetic hydrocarbons via two main routes: MtJ or Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Unlike bio-SAF, it avoids agricultural feedstocks, reducing land use by 3–30 times and water use by up to 1,000 times, while achieving 85%–95% lifecycle GHG reductions.19,20 This advantage comes with high energy intensity, about 15 megawatt hour (MWh)–20 MWh of renewable electricity per metric t of fuel, making power availability the key scalability constraint.21 Today, costs are €4,000/t–€6,000/t, nearly 6–8 times the cost of fossil jet fuel and 2–3 times the cost of bio-SAF but could fall below €2,000 by 2050 with large-scale deployment and cheaper renewables.22 These characteristics position eSAF as a cornerstone for deep decarbonization, contingent on investments in renewable energy and CO₂ capture infrastructure.

Fischer-Tropsch vs. MtJ pathways. Fischer-Tropsch is an American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) approved pathway for SAF, certified for up to 50% blending and recertification. MtJ is not yet approved; it is under evaluation before inclusion in the ATSM standard specification.23,24 Both pathways can enable the production of drop-in SAF using renewable carbon sources.25 Fischer-Tropsch, a commercially mature process, converts synthetic gas (syngas) directly into liquid hydrocarbons, while MtJ first produces methanol, then converts it into light olefins such as ethylene and propylene using zeolite catalysts.

These olefins are oligomerized into longer hydrocarbon chains, which are equivalent to the intermediates from the Fischer-Tropsch process.26 Then these long chains undergo a hydrocracking process to a shorter-chain jet range (C9-C14), and finally these linear paraffins are isomerized to meet the aviation fuel cold properties. Both pathways are critical for scaling SAF beyond bio-feedstock limits.27

Within the MtJ route, a high potential pathway is methanol-to-olefins (MTO), which is particularly relevant for the production of eSAF from eMethanol. This distinction is critical because bio-methanol is generally not suitable for bio-SAF production due to sustainability, purity and economic constraints, making eMethanol the preferred feedstock for this pathway. Additionally, the MTO approach creates synergies with other sectors by enabling the production of sustainable olefins, which are also key intermediates for low-carbon chemicals and materials.

Future outlook for eSAF. SAF remains a critical element in aviation decarbonization strategies. Its production leverages MTO, providing a promising route to jet-range hydrocarbons while maintaining integration with chemical and energy value chains. The Global Impact Coalition (GIC) is actively working on several projects focused on MTO and sustainable methanol, adjacent to emerging technologies for SAF. These initiatives can help accelerate the transition toward a more sustainable and scalable SAF supply, leveraging synergies across energy and chemical sectors. Meeting the target of increasing SAF output to 17 MMt by 2030 will require diversification of pathways. eSAF represents a technically viable option to accelerate capacity expansion, leveraging sustainable synthetic feedstocks to reduce reliance on conventional fossil fuel.

NEW in 2025, Poultry Tech Summit will be held in collaboration with the U.S. Roundtable for Sustainable Poultry and Eggs (US-RSPE) annual meeting held November 5, 2025.","United Airlines and Darling Ingredients are building a comprehensive sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) marketplace by connecting the entire value chain — from waste fats and oils to finished fuel products.

""Fifteen years ago, a lot of the waste fats were used for just calories in animal feed,"" explained Ethan Carter, director of sustainability, Darling Ingredients, “They weren't really the nutritional value — they're just calories, essentially. And we were trying to look for what's the best and highest use for these.""

""Airlines are thinking about the entire fuel value chain as part of our decarbonization journeys. When it comes to lower carbon fuels like SAF, the feedstocks are an integral part of the product,"" added Ryan Backman-Flamerich, senior manager, United Airlines Decarbonization team who leads the airline’s SAF procurement efforts.

""We look at our role not just as a consumer and purchaser of SAF, but in many ways, we're also very active in also working towards policy solutions.""

At the U.S. Roundtable for Sustainable Poultry and Eggs (US-RSPE) annual meeting, Backman-Flamerich and Carter will discuss how partnerships between the rendering and aviation industries are advancing decarbonization goals, the role of agriculture in circular economies, and how the poultry sector can become a strategic player in renewable energy.

On November 4-5, the US-RSPE Annual Meeting will unite stakeholders from across the supply chain to advance measurable sustainability outcomes in poultry and egg production. The educational program will be held in collaboration with the 2025 Poultry Tech Summit on November 3-5, 2025, at the Atlanta Airport Marriot in Atlanta, Georgia.

Registration for both events is now open.

Uniting to advance sustainability

Through their joint venture with Valero for Diamond Green Diesel (DGD), Darling processes multiple waste streams — including poultry fats, tallow, used cooking oil, and distillers corn oil from ethanol production — into renewable diesel and SAF.

Carter emphasized the urgency of available solutions: ""This is the solution we have now. We can use waste fats and oils, refine them, and we can decarbonize that heavy industry that's really difficult to decarbonize in a short time frame.""

He contrasted this with emerging technologies, noting that ""when you look at a lot of the things that airlines are working on that are 5, 10, 15 years away for some of the solutions, like e-fuels,"" waste-based SAF offers immediate impact.

Connecting throughout the value chain

According to Backman-Flamerich: ""We at United, we see our decarbonization journey as partly helping to build the solutions that will drive decarbonization in aviation. For SAF, we are building an ecosystem, and that is not going to happen if it is just a one-sided platform. We have to collaborate with others to scale SAF with our ambitions.""

Airlines are increasingly moving up the value chain through equity investments, strategic partnerships, and leveraging their fuel subsidiaries, while feedstock producers like Darling have moved downstream through processing ventures.

“Darling is a little bit unique in the feedstock space in that they have the joint venture with Valero for DGD,"" Backman-Flamerich noted. ""In that sense, Darling has moved further down the value chain than probably many feedstock producers.""

Beyond decarbonization, SAF production addresses critical energy security concerns. With traditional refineries closing across the U.S. due to reduced demand for petroleum products in other sectors, and refineries unable to operate profitably on jet fuel alone, the industry faces a potential crisis.

The agreement was announced in Hong Kong on the sidelines of the IATA World Sustainability Symposium at a ceremony hosted by Cathay Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer Alex McGowan, and Airbus President Asia Pacific Anand Stanley.

Under the terms of the partnership, the two companies will work to identify, evaluate and invest in projects that support the scaling of SAF production towards 2030 and beyond. Projects will be assessed based on their commercial viability, technological maturity, and potential for long-term offtake.

Scaling SAF adoption requires deep collaboration across the value chain, from policymakers and investors to SAF producers, airlines and customers. This co-investment agreement reflects the spirit of partnership with Airbus and Cathay teaming up to accelerate production capability for more meaningful impact.

Cathay’s Alex McGowan said: “SAF remains the most important lever for Cathay and the wider aviation industry to drive toward our common decarbonization goals. This co-investment partnership with Airbus underscores our commitment to supporting a more scalable SAF industry in the near term. It complements our broader strategy of investing in the technologies and production capacity that can transform the industry in the long run, including our participation in the recently launched oneworld BEV SAF Fund. Meanwhile, we are also expanding SAF usage today through partnerships with like-minded organizations.”

Airbus’s Anand Stanley said: “This agreement reflects the shared commitment of Airbus and Cathay to make a real difference. The production and distribution of affordable SAF at scale requires an unprecedented cross-sectoral approach. Our partnership with Cathay is a concrete example of how we catalyze production in the most suitable locations to serve our customers.”

The partnership also includes collaboration to advocate for supportive SAF policies on both the supply and demand side across Asia. With the region’s strong potential in feedstock supply, production capacity, and its vibrant aviation market, Cathay and Airbus aim to leverage their global experience to help shape policies that make SAF more accessible and affordable in this part of the world.

Source: The Straits Times

Singapore can now impose a fixed levy on all departing flights after Parliament passed a Bill on Oct 14 to support the use of sustainable aviation fuel by airlines.

Sustainable aviation fuel, mostly made from waste materials such as used cooking oil, has been deemed the most practical way to decarbonise the aviation industry as it can be blended with jet fuel and used on existing aircraft and refuelling infrastructure without any costly modifications.

The Bill was passed unanimously.

Presenting the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (Amendment) Bill for debate, Senior Minister of State for Transport Sun Xueling said the proposed changes will allow the green jet fuel levy to be paid to the CAAS, which will set up a fund to procure and manage such fuel.

Noting that green jet fuel costs about three to four times more than traditional jet fuel, she said Singapore has chosen a “pragmatic and balanced approach” in setting a target for sustainable aviation fuel to constitute 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi Airport and Seletar Airport in 2026.

Singapore will collect the funds needed to procure green jet fuel in an upfront manner through the levy.

Preliminary estimates from the CAAS had suggested that economy-class passengers may incur an additional $3 levy for short-haul flights, $6 for medium-haul flights and $16 for long-haul flights, such as those to Bangkok, Tokyo and London, respectively.

MPs such as Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang West) and Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Changi GRC) asked about the impact of the levy, and reasons for passing the costs on to passengers through higher air ticket prices.

More specifically, Ms Poh asked why the cost burden is to be borne solely by consumers, instead of airlines.

Responding, Ms Sun said the sustainable aviation fuel levy will be paid by different parties, including aircraft operators. It is calculated based on the ultimate user of the air transport service, she added, so aircraft operators will be allowed to pass the levy on to end users such as passengers or shippers.

The amount of the green jet fuel levy that each end user has to pay will be displayed transparently, she said.

Certain flights will be exempted from the levy, such as those used for flight training and for charitable or humanitarian purposes, she added.

Addressing a question by Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang), Ms Sun said passengers transiting or transferring through Singapore will not need to pay the sustainable aviation fuel levy.

She acknowledged that transit and transfer passengers are a critical part of air traffic through Changi Airport.

Although they do not start or end their journeys in Singapore, they enhance the nation’s connectivity by supporting a broader network of destinations and higher flight frequencies, she said.

Ms Sun added that the Government plans to ensure that Changi Airport remains competitive enough for these passengers to continue choosing to transit or transfer through Singapore, and hence will not impose the levy on them.

Several MPs, including Ms Gho Sze Kee (Mountbatten) and Mr Yip, asked about how the levy could potentially affect Changi Airport’s competitiveness as a global air hub.

Responding, Ms Sun said airlines and passengers fly through Changi Airport for various reasons, including safety, network and connectivity.

The Government will keep a close watch on Changi Airport’s charges and costs, she said, adding that it has calibrated its approach to adopting green jet fuel with “safeguards” to maintain the air hub’s competitiveness.

Ms Sun said the Government has consulted the industry and assessed that starting with a 1 per cent green jet fuel adoption target is “manageable”, and will not increase air ticket prices significantly.

Under this model, the total amount spent on sustainable aviation fuel each year will be pre-determined based on the usage target set and the projected cost of the fuel, she noted.

“We can decide how much cost we want to bear, and provide cost certainty for airlines and passengers,” said Ms Sun, who assured the MPs that Changi’s competitiveness would not be adversely impacted.

Conversely, simply mandating the use of sustainable aviation fuel across the board would impose unpredictable and unsustainable costs on airlines and passengers, she added.

Responding to Mr Dennis Tan (Hougang) on possible greenwashing due to the use of certain feedstock in sustainable aviation fuel that may create external pollutants, Ms Sun said the green jet fuel procured will comply with the requirements set out by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.

She added that the Economic Development Board has been in discussions with existing energy firms on retrofitting current refinery units, while research institutes are investing in technology that can advance biofuel production.",https://www.britcham.org.sg/sites/default/files/2025-10/588e03f28957c5ef712849602237c7fb65f937ca53b1072eb97bc9cb04a803fd.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 17:56:53.278582

This week, the world's largest governing body for all things energy published a report that analyses the state of play for sustainable fuels globally. The IEA's analysis projects that use of sustainable liquid and gaseous fuels will quadruple by 2035, should existing and recently announced policies be fully implemented.

The report, which was prepared to support COP30, looks at the pathways the world must take in order to accelerate the rollout and production of biofuels, biogas and all hydrogen-based fuels across sectors like transport, heavy industry and power generation.

The current landscape and the projected trajectory

Currently, sustainable fuels represent just 1.3% of the world's total energy consumption, with liquid biofuels making up nearly 80% of that amount.

In 2024, these fuels helped to reduce global oil demand by around 2.5 million barrels a day, while lowering the dependence that some countries have on imported transport fuels by between 5-15%.

""Between 2010 and 2024, global demand for sustainable liquid and gaseous fuels doubled,"" the report states, encouragingly. Nevertheless, prevailing trends suggest that we are likelier to see gradual progress, rather than the level of acceleration that will be needed to meet global climate targets.

Policy implementation as catalyst

The IEA's accelerated case scenario assumes that any policies that are currently 'planned' will become fully legislated, while it also assumes that market barriers will be removed and production capacity expanded in order to meet new demand.

Should these things fall into place, the IEA forecasts that sustainable fuel use will nearly double to 13 exajoules by 2030 and reach 28 exajoules by 2035.

Transport would remain the primary driver here, accounting for 50% of sustainable fuel consumption in 2035, with fuels covering 10% of road transport demand, 15% of aviation and 35% of shipping.

The report also identifies six priority actions for governments, including the establishment of clear roadmaps, increasing the predictability of demand and developing transparent carbon accounting methodologies.

""Accelerating the deployment of sustainable fuels requires a mix of ambitious, stable and enforceable policies, such as mandates and performance standards, along with proactive public procurement,"" according to the analysis.

Those in the private sector also understand the need for state support. ""We need policy on our side,"" says Alice Henry, Co-Founder and CEO of RegenRate, a small UK-based business that helps to grow biofuel feedstock.

""We need rules that reward farmers for doing the right thing, and certification that’s fast, fair and rooted in reality,"" she adds.

Investment and employment implications

Cumulative investments between 2024 and 2035 could reach US$1.5 trillion across all sustainable fuel types in the accelerated scenario.

Direct employment would nearly triple to approximately 2 million jobs by 2035, with liquid and gaseous biofuels accounting for two-thirds of this growth.

Investments in sustainable fuels grew 20% between 2023 and 2024, driven by policies in the United States and Brazil for liquid biofuels, and the European Union's REPowerEU Plan for biogas.

Technology diversity and regional variation

The portfolio of sustainable fuels is expected to evolve significantly, with liquid and gaseous biofuels maintaining a two-thirds share in 2035 whilst low-emissions hydrogen and derivatives expand from 1% currently to one-third of total use.

That shift is reflected in the IEA's analysis, wherein it is predicting that funding for hydrogen-based solutions will skyrocket.

""With $1.5tn in sustainable fuel investments expected through 2035, and hydrogen-based fuels accounting for nearly half, renewable methanol is positioned as a vital solution for shipping, chemicals and beyond,"" says Antonio Villaluenga, VP of US Project Development at Carbon Recycling International.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/20a60b309b2e6e25407d4ef95a2ac226:8ff0d98b8b27817b39e8695b1dc6c686/graphics-for-work-61.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 11:56:30.106978

There, a production aircraft lifted off and landed using a complete sustainable aviation fuel blend in its HF120 engines without any modification. The flight used a neat mix of HEFA SPK and HDO SAK, confirming full blend operability beyond the 50 percent limits common in regular service.

Why this matters for business aviation and beyond

Pressure to decarbonize aviation is growing as operators seek credible steps they can take today. A full blend demonstration on a certified light jet shows that emissions reductions do not rely only on new airframes or radical propulsion changes. This HondaJet milestone aligns with a broader corporate goal to decarbonize operations by mid century while building operator confidence in practical sustainability options for existing fleets.

Another reason this is significant is drop in capability. SAF pathways like HEFA SPK provide kerosene like performance that fits current engines and fuel systems. Adding an aromatic component such as HDO SAK helps meet material compatibility targets so fuel seals and systems work as designed, which is critical for full blend use on both engines and the entire fuel system.

How the HondaJet validated 100 percent SAF

The HF120 engine from GE Honda Aero had already undergone controlled, full SAF ground testing as early as 2022 using HEFA SPK, with more testing on other low carbon pathways. Those programs benchmarked performance against Jet A and confirmed no loss in thrust or operability, setting the stage for an in aircraft flight on a complete SAF blend.

During the demonstration, both engines ran on the same neat blend, not a split tank test. No special hardware was added to the airframe, and the aircraft performed within normal handling and performance envelopes. This operational profile sets the flight apart from earlier research sorties that used one engine on full SAF and the other on conventional fuel for comparison.

What the fuel blend tells us

HEFA SPK is made from waste lipids like used cooking oils and tallow. It delivers high energy content with very low sulfur and aromatic levels, which improves emissions and reduces particulates. HDO SAK adds synthetic aromatics that help meet material compatibility and density targets for aircraft fuel systems.

The combined result is a drop in, full blend fuel that maintains range, cold weather operability, and engine durability for a light jet mission.

Why the HondaJet platform is a strong SAF demonstrator

The airframe emphasizes drag reduction with an over the wing engine mount, natural laminar flow surfaces, and a clean systems layout focused on efficiency. Operators already report favorable fuel burn compared to peers in the same class, which amplifies lifecycle emissions benefits when using low carbon fuels.

The aircraft’s widespread use in owner flown and charter missions also makes it visible to market segments that can act quickly on voluntary sustainability initiatives.

What still needs to scale

Cost and availability remain the biggest hurdles. SAF carries a price premium that narrows as production scales, but supply is still concentrated at selected hubs.

Broader adoption will depend on policy support, investment in production pathways such as HEFA and alcohol to jet, and airport storage and blending capability. Demonstrations on production aircraft validate technical readiness while signaling demand to producers and fuel distributors.

How this milestone fits the larger SAF timeline

The engine story began years earlier. GE Honda Aero completed controlled, 100 percent SAF ground tests on the HF120 in 2022, comparing performance with conventional Jet A. Those runs demonstrated equivalent operability and paved the way for this flight on a full blend in a customer deliverable airframe.

With both lab and flight data in hand, the focus shifts to certification workstreams and broader operator enablement at airports where SAF supply is ramping up.",https://www.flexaircharters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/hondaJet-saf-main.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 14:03:50.576612

Hydrogen could play a key role in this process, and scientific research is being conducted on this topic at the University of Pécs Hydrogen Center.

As they wrote, the problem is that the vast majority of hydrogen used today is so-called gray hydrogen, that is produced from natural gas with significant carbon dioxide emissions. A more sustainable solution is green hydrogen, obtained by splitting water using renewable energy sources. However, in Europe, the proportion of green hydrogen is currently still below 5 percent, they pointed out.

As reported by The Tech Journal, the Royal Aeronautical Society’s recent People in Aerospace conference revealed that the aerospace/aviation sector struggles to attract the next generation of talent. Despite many technological advances underway, generating high demand for skills and specialisations, many young people perceive the industry as outdated, opaque, and insufficiently aligned with their climate-action mindset.

Speakers at the conference reported that many schoolchildren simply don’t see aerospace as a viable pathway, many teachers and parents lack awareness, industry outreach is fragmented, and employer-school coordination is weak.

“We need lots of people with varied skill sets… proficiency levels will increase around AI, data analytics, and robotics,” says John Watton, Technical Capability Director at GKN Aerospace and Chair of the People & Skills Working Group at the Aerospace Growth Partnership. “But it’s clear we do not have a pipeline to meet our national objectives,”

Many job opportunities in aviation are invisible to younger generations

Many young people associate aviation with careers as pilots or engineers, and may assume they aren’t suited for these career paths, while other opportunities in aviation in the sciences and technology may fall below the radar.

There are too few narratives linking aviation careers with solving big global challenges, such as climate change, clean tech, and sustainable mobility. As a result, students may gravitate towards sectors that are seen as more future-facing, such as software, renewables, and electric vehicles.

Of course, aviation has many opportunities in those fields, including software engineering and AI applications, research and development of alternative fuel sources, including sustainable aviation fuel, and electric or hybrid propulsion systems.

Speakers at the People in Aerospace conference describe the aerospace sector as having legacy training frameworks, male-dominated traditions, and hidden barriers (like swimming requirements for pilots, and cultural isolation in specific populations) that further reduce its appeal to a diverse young talent base.

These are the issues that aviation must tackle to attract the workforce it will need in future.

Aviation is where climate innovation is accelerating

Despite the perception problem, the aviation sector is undergoing a profound transformation in sustainability. From the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, mandating a 2% SAF blend in 2025 rising to 70% by 2050, to the UK’s own SAF Mandate targeting 10 % by 2030, airlines and fuel producers are building an entirely new clean-energy ecosystem.

At the same time, Europe’s Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking (CAJU) is funding hybrid-electric and hydrogen demonstrators with the goal of zero-emission regional aircraft by 2035.

Digitalisation is another sustainability lever. The International Energy Agency estimates AI-driven air-traffic management and predictive maintenance could cut sector-wide emissions by 10–15 % even before new propulsion systems mature.

Aviation is not standing still. It’s engineering a revolution in fuels, propulsion and data—the climate-tech innovation many young people say they want to work on.

Aviation careers narrative needs an urgent turnaround

Speakers at the Royal Aeronautical Society’s conference pointed to an urgent need to change the narrative around aviation careers to avoid a critical shortage of a skilled workforce.

Janine Hornsby, Chief Executive of the Air League, warned: “This is not a new problem. We’ve been talking about it for 20 years. If we don’t act now, the industry won’t be here.”

Royal Aeronautical Society Chief Executive David Edwards recalled: “Back in 1999, the Society published a paper predicting exactly the skills crisis we face today. It said this wasn’t a government problem to fix but a sector problem to resolve—and that’s still true.”

“This isn’t just a UK problem—every country is facing it. We need collaboration on a global scale to share best practices and ideas,” Jones said.

The UK’s Generation Aviation gains interest but key initiatives are still unrecognised

The UK Department for Transport’s Generation Aviation review warned of a gap between schools and industry, particularly among underrepresented groups.

69% of respondents to the surveys conducted on Generation Aviation in 2023 and 2024 thought that the aviation industry is entirely or primarily responsible for ensuring that future aviation skills are met.

The 2024 survey found that awareness of the various initiatives to interest youth in career opportunities in the sector has improved over the last year. In March 2024, 71% of participants had heard of Generation Aviation (versus 57% in February 2023) and almost half (46%) knew what it was (versus 27% in February 2023).

Generation Aviation has increased the overall visibility of the aviation sector through industry events.

“Some participants were aware of certain elements of the programme through being part of the programme in some way, for example, knowing an Aviation Ambassador, contributing to specific research, sitting on the board at associations, or attending launch events,” the report’s authors state.

Awareness of specific schemes varies; recruitment events, educational partnerships, and future aviation skills research are still low. It was suggested that the programme be promoted in new spaces, such as government departments and local authorities.​

The aviation industry is advancing climate innovation, including sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen, electrification and AI-driven efficiency. If the industry can communicate its transformation convincingly, the same generation that sees it as part of the problem could become the one that solves it.

Walsh said countries in Southeast Asia such as Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are well-positioned to develop feedstocks that can be converted into sustainable fuels for the transport sector.
""All of these countries have an opportunity to provide feedstock that can be used for the development of sustainable fuels.
""When we look at Asia and Southeast Asia, we see lots of feedstock opportunities there,"" Walsh said during a media briefing at the IATA World Sustainability Symposium.
The report estimates that around 1,580 million tonnes of feedstock could be allocated to SAF, enough to produce more than 300 million tonnes of bio-based SAF in 2050.","KUALA LUMPUR: Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, has the opportunity to become a key player in the global shift towards sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

This is by leveraging the region's vast feedstock potential, said International Air Transport Association (IATA) director general Willie Walsh.

Walsh said countries in Southeast Asia such as Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are well-positioned to develop feedstocks that can be converted into sustainable fuels for the transport sector.

""All of these countries have an opportunity to provide feedstock that can be used for the development of sustainable fuels. It's not just for air transport, it's also for road transport.""

""When we look at Asia and Southeast Asia, we see lots of feedstock opportunities there,"" Walsh said during a media briefing at the IATA World Sustainability Symposium.

""So, there's an opportunity to develop a whole new industry, generate employment, reduce dependence on importing oil, and create a positive outcome for the environment as well,"" he added.

According to IATA's Global Feedstock Assessment for SAF Production – Outlook to 2050 report, the world could produce up to 400 million tonnes of SAF by 2050, a major increase from the estimated two million tonnes in 2025 but still short of the 500 million tonnes required for the industry to reach net zero carbon emissions.

The report highlights Southeast Asia as one of the most promising regions for feedstock availability due to its agricultural residues, palm oil mill effluent (POME), and municipal solid waste that can be processed into SAF.

Asean nations such as Indonesia and Malaysia together with China could supply about 240 million tonnes which is 15 per cent of the world's total biomass feedstock for SAF by 2050.

Biomass feedstock potential is projected to exceed 12,000 million tonnes by 2050 globally, but less than 35 per cent of that will realistically be available for bioenergy and biofuels due to competing needs in other industries.

The report estimates that around 1,580 million tonnes of feedstock could be allocated to SAF, enough to produce more than 300 million tonnes of bio-based SAF in 2050.

Walsh said Asia would play a world leading role in the transition to net zero by 2050.

""So, it's important that we have the opportunity to stay in touch with airlines in this region and the leaders in this region to understand what's happening here,"" he said.

He added that Cathay Pacific is a world leader in sustainability given their commitment to ensure the industry can transition to net zero.

IATA senior vice president for sustainability and chief economist Marie Owens Thomsen added that Asia would most likely generate the solutions needed for airline decarbonisation over the coming decades.

""We think that this region is the main generator of the solutions we need for airlines' decarbonisation over the coming decades and that's good.

""We also look forward to the growth in demand for air transport services in this region, which we also think is going to be the predominant growth generator in our industry going forward,"" she said.

She added that while optimism remains high, the industry must take a clear-eyed view of where it stands today.

""We unfortunately have only 0.7 per cent of airlines' total fuel demand satisfied by SAF, and we are well short of these carbon credits that airlines need to buy under Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation.""

""We sort of know what needs to be done. We know what the path should look like going forward. But we're really struggling getting world leaders to want it as much as we do,"" Thomsen said.",https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/42C2C545F2F0B130812A10D6376A7469_low.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 08:56:25.626678

The blending mandate would start at 1%, rising to 10% by 2035, the 6 October report said.

From 2028, international airlines would also need to use SAF-blended fuel for at least 90% of their annual refuelling at South Korean airports, Greenair News wrote.

Jointly developed by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE), the new policies were part of the country’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Blending Mandate Roadmap.

A SAF Alliance was also set up to unite representatives of the aviation and refining sectors with related agencies to promote SAF supply and use.

The ministries proposed offering rewards to airlines using more than the mandated SAF minimum blend, and for passengers making specific contributions towards the cost of the fuel while also warning of steep penalties for non-compliance.

South Korea’s new package of SAF initiatives followed the government’s announcement in August 2024 of its SAF Expansion Strategy, which outlined a mid-to-long term vision to promote use of the fuel in line with global efforts to help decarbonise air transport.

The initiative also broadened plans to develop and deploy SAF within the greater Asia-Pacific region, the world’s largest collective air transport market, where a range of strategies had been announced or deployed in countries including Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, India, Indonesia, China and Australia, the report said.

Beyond the initial 1% SAF mandate for international flights, the government said the blending ratio would increase to 3%-5% in 2030 and 7%-10% in 2035.

Specific ratios would be set in 2026 and 2029 based on the government’s assessment of domestic SAF production capacity, international obligations and global market conditions, Greenair News wrote.

Fuel suppliers, particularly refining companies and petrol exporters and importers, would need to meet blending obligations from 2027, with compliance determined by the proportion of SAF supplied each year for use in jet fuel for international flights from South Korea.

However, the requirement for airlines to ensure that SAF-blended fuel comprises 90% of their annual volumes for departing flights would not take effect until 2028, following the introduction of a refuelling obligation management system in 2026/27 and pilot operations in the first half of 2028.

The South Korean decree for international flights built on a 1% blending ratio deployed by nine domestic airlines which used locally-produced SAF on selected short-haul routes.

Korean Air had expanded the use of domestically-produced SAF on routes to Kobe and Osaka in Japan, following a year-long trial on its Incheon-Haneda route, the report said.

Airbus and Cathay invest US$70 million to accelerate SAV growth

Airbus and the Cathay Group (Cathay) have announced a joint investment of up to US$70 million. The goal is to speed up the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) across Asia and beyond. This marks another strong step towards cleaner, lower-carbon air travel.

The agreement was unveiled in Hong Kong during the IATA World Sustainability Symposium. The event was hosted by Cathay’s Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer, Alex McGowan, and Airbus President Asia-Pacific, Anand Stanley.

Under the new partnership, both companies will work together to identify and invest in key SAF projects. Each project will be reviewed for its commercial potential, technical readiness, and long-term production prospects. The aim is to scale up supply towards 2030 and beyond.

Expanding SAF production, however, demands close cooperation across the aviation chain. Policymakers, investors, producers, and airlines must all play a part. This co-investment reflects that shared commitment, with Airbus and Cathay uniting to accelerate capacity and create wider environmental impact.

“This agreement reflects the shared commitment of Airbus and Cathay to make a real difference,” said Anand Stanley, President Asia Pacific, Airbus. “The production and distribution of affordable SAF at scale requires an unprecedented cross-sectoral approach. Our partnership with Cathay is a concrete example of how we catalyse production in the most suitable locations to serve our customers.”

The collaboration will also focus on policy advocacy. Both companies aim to support measures that encourage SAF production and use across Asia. The region’s strong feedstock base, growing expertise, and busy aviation market make it ideal for progress.

Energy company Vibra recently announced plans to supply SAF on the domestic market, although imported from European suppliers.
Mr. Alvo said the airline is also closely monitoring Brazil’s airport infrastructure.
“The outlook for Brazil’s domestic market is positive.
I’m optimistic about the Brazilian market next year,” Mr. Alvo said.","The industry’s main bet to cut emissions is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Global production is projected to reach 1.9 billion liters in 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA)—three times more than in 2023 but still only 0.53% of total fuel demand.

“We have to look seriously at SAF. There isn’t a single drop being produced today in the [Latin American] region,” Mr. Alvo told Valor during the Latin American and Caribbean Air Transport Association (ALTA) conference in Lima. Globally, the sector has pledged to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

Brazil is seen as a potential leader in the field, given its expertise with ethanol. Some companies are studying the technology domestically, but none have yet begun production. Among the major players exploring the market is Petrobras, which is expected soon to offer a jet fuel partially derived from vegetable oils—a process that reduces emissions in a similar way to ethanol blending in automotive gasoline.

Energy company Vibra recently announced plans to supply SAF on the domestic market, although imported from European suppliers.

The issue is a strategic priority for Latam, which in mid-2022 pledged that 5% of its total fuel consumption will come from SAF by 2030.

Mr. Alvo said the airline is also closely monitoring Brazil’s airport infrastructure. One key concern is congestion at São Paulo’s Congonhas Airport, where renovation work next year is expected to worsen crowding.

Regarding the Brazilian market, the CEO said the outlook remains highly positive. Latam recently raised its 2025 capacity forecast to growth between 9.5% and 10.5%, up from 7% to 9% previously.

According to IATA, domestic air-travel demand in Brazil grew 12.7% in August from a year earlier—the highest monthly increase among all markets tracked by the association.

“The outlook for Brazil’s domestic market is positive. We are very pleased with the investment in Embraer aircraft, which will allow us to connect new cities where smaller jets perform better. I’m optimistic about the Brazilian market next year,” Mr. Alvo said.

Latam has placed an order for up to 74 E195-E2 jets from Embraer, including 24 firm orders worth $2.1 billion at list prices. The airline expects to define within six months the routes that will be served by the new aircraft, with São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Brasília, Fortaleza, and Porto Alegre among the key hubs under consideration.

The arrival of the E2 model is expected to open up as many as 35 new destinations across Latam’s network, most of them within Brazil.

The group reported a second-quarter net profit of $242 million, up 66% from a year earlier, driven by a 7.6% increase in passenger numbers to 20.6 million during the period.",https://s2-valorinternational.glbimg.com/SWw2rAX_mQ1MzSJAwZo9xZ3GMjY=/1200x/smart/filters:cover():strip_icc()/i.s3.glbimg.com/v1/AUTH_63b422c2caee4269b8b34177e8876b93/internal_photos/bs/2025/C/J/kyVmIBSjmyUFoUWmdMcQ/21emp-100-latam-b5-img01.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 08:56:43.838653

This joint investment aims to accelerate the development of SAF production in Asia and beyond.

The agreement was announced in Hong Kong during a ceremony hosted by Cathay chief operations and service delivery officer Alex McGowan, and Anand Stanley, Airbus’ president in the Asia-Pacific.

McGowan said: “SAF remains the most important lever for Cathay and the wider aviation industry to drive toward our common decarbonisation goals. This co-investment partnership with Airbus underscores our commitment to supporting a more scalable SAF industry in the near term. It complements our broader strategy of investing in the technologies and production capacity that can transform the industry in the long run, including our participation in the recently launched oneworld BEV SAF Fund. Meanwhile, we are also expanding SAF usage today through partnerships with like-minded organisations.”

Stanley added: “This agreement reflects the shared commitment of Airbus and Cathay to make a real difference. The production and distribution of affordable SAF at scale requires an unprecedented cross-sectoral approach. Our partnership with Cathay is a concrete example of how we catalyse production in the most suitable locations to serve our customers.”

The partnership also includes collaboration to advocate for supportive SAF policies on both the supply and demand side across Asia.

With the region’s strong potential in feedstock supply, production capacity, and its vibrant aviation market, Cathay and Airbus aim to leverage their global experience to help shape policies that make SAF more accessible and affordable in this part of the world.

What the partnership entails

Under the terms of the partnership, the two companies will work to identify, evaluate and invest in projects that support the scaling of SAF production towards 2030 and beyond.

Projects will be assessed based on their commercial viability, technological maturity, and potential for long-term offtake.

Scaling SAF adoption requires deep collaboration across the value chain, from policymakers and investors to SAF producers, airlines and customers.

This co-investment agreement reflects the spirit of partnership with Airbus and Cathay teaming up to accelerate production capability for more meaningful impact.

Prior to this most recent joint investment, Cathay also joined as a launch investor in the oneworld BEV SAF Fund, a joint initiative with other oneworld airlines and Bill Gates’ climate investment firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures, just last month.

That fund focuses on novel, next-generation SAF technologies with the potential to scale significantly and reduce costs.

Complementing this, the Cathay–Airbus partnership will target more mature SAF opportunities to accelerate near- to medium-term availability.

“At its core, Avflight exists to serve its communities worldwide,” explains Joe Meszaros, the company’s vice president of operations.
The transition to electric ground support equipment has delivered tangible benefits beyond carbon reduction.
“Our ramps are quieter, which improves our team’s working environment while reducing noise exposure for the surrounding community,” Meszaros notes.
Roadmap for growth Looking ahead, Avflight plans to expand its charging network, and increase electric ground equipment adoption where electrical grids support it.","The aviation industry’s commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 isn’t just talk for Avflight Corporation. The operator of 26 full-service FBOs across North America and Europe has already electrified significant portions of its ground support equipment and installed eVTOL charging stations at multiple locations.

“At its core, Avflight exists to serve its communities worldwide,” explains Joe Meszaros, the company’s vice president of operations. “That service extends to community stewardship in the form of sustainability.”

Avflight’s sustainability journey began with straightforward efficiency improvements – LED lighting, high-efficiency heating systems, and recycling programs. But as new technologies emerged, the company accelerated its commitment through infrastructure development and strategic partnerships.

The transition to electric ground support equipment has delivered tangible benefits beyond carbon reduction. “Our ramps are quieter, which improves our team’s working environment while reducing noise exposure for the surrounding community,” Meszaros notes. Operators also appreciate the smoother torque of electric tugs, which enables more precise aircraft movements.

However, the conversion isn’t without challenges. Each airport presents electrical capacity constraints, permitting requirements and installation timelines. “The transition has required carefully planned charger placements to avoid interference with ramp safety or day-to-day operations,” Meszaros explains.

Future-proofing

The company’s partnership with Beta Technologies exemplifies its forward-thinking approach. Charging stations are now operational at six Avflight locations, with more planned. These multi-modal units, built around the Combined Charging System (CCS) standard, can support both electric aircraft and ground vehicles using the same infrastructure.

“This flexibility is critical because it maximizes the utility of each installation and simplifies ramp planning,” Meszaros says. “By future-proofing in this way, we can serve a wide variety of electric assets as adoption grows.”

Beyond electrification, Avflight leverages its relationship with sister company Avfuel to promote sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) adoption. Through the AvfuelZero program, operators can access physical SAF molecules where available, or use a book-and-claim model where physical supply isn’t yet feasible.

“The first step is always education,” Meszaros explains regarding customer engagement with SAF. “For those who are interested, we explain what SAF is and how it fits into their operation without disrupting performance.”

“From there, we can help facilitate a book and claim transaction for SAF or even carbon offsets to help reduce their net carbon emissions. We do so by leveraging the AvfuelZero program, which streamlines sustainability logistics, and provides both proper certification and transparent reporting for sustainable products.”

According to Meszaros the core challenges of SAF adoption isn’t technical at the FBO level. “The primary hurdles are less about technical feasibility and more about supply chain logistics. Does sufficient demand exist at your airport? Can supply be efficiently brought into your location?

“Because SAF is a drop-in replacement for jet fuel, meeting ASTM D1655 certification for jet fuel, it actually does not require separate storage or unique handling procedures,” he explains.

According to Meszaros, customer response to Avflight’s sustainability initiatives has been overwhelmingly positive.

“They appreciate the quieter ramps, carbon offsets, and the assurance that their FBO partner is investing ahead of industry demand,” he says. “For many operators, our commitment helps them meet internal goals and provides evidence they can share with their own stakeholders to demonstrate progress.”

Meszaros believes that sustainability is slowly, but steadily, becoming a factor in FBO choice. “That influence comes from a number of places, it could be passengers’ personal convictions, corporate goals, company stakeholder values or community principles.

“In any case, environmentally conscious aviation operations want to know their partners are serious about providing sustainable solutions that work, whether that’s physical SAF supply, book-and-claim or electric vehicle charging capabilities. Our proactive work in sustainability strengthens our competitive position,” he says.

Meszaros says that the company tracks environmental impact through measurable outcomes. “This includes creating a carbon emissions benchmark that is now tracked annually. For each location, we look at the use of utilities, like gas and electric, as well as fuel use, like diesel and Mogas. When adopting electric GSE, we expect to see fuel use decline and some uptick in our electric utilities, but the net benefit would be positive,” he says.

Roadmap for growth

Looking ahead, Avflight plans to expand its charging network, and increase electric ground equipment adoption where electrical grids support it.

“We will continue to use energy efficient building designs and materials for new hangar and terminal developments,” he says. “We also plan to work closely with Avfuel to connect more customers to SAF solutions, making physical supply available where feasible and expanding book-and-claim options everywhere else.

“We intend to support innovation by engaging with technology partners who are developing the next generation of lower-carbon power solutions. Our role is to bridge that innovation to the operators we serve.”

For FBO operators beginning their sustainability journey, Meszaros recommends starting with baseline assessments of operational impact and local energy infrastructure.

“That foundation gives you the clarity to set realistic goals and track improvements over time,” he says.

“Once you have that picture, begin with practical, high-value measures, for example, piloting electric ground support equipment in one or two high-utilization roles, upgrading lighting or HVAC systems to more efficient options, and implementing transparent emissions accounting so customers can trust your reporting from the start. As your program develops, look toward progressive enhancements that align with your growth and resources.”

He emphasizes the need to treat sustainability as a continuous journey rather than a fixed destination.

“Build in regular reviews to raise your level of ambition, and prioritize partnerships early. Collaboration accelerates progress and builds credibility, enabling us as an industry to deliver meaningful change together.”

Meszaros believes it is possible for aviation companies to grow while still being environmentally responsible. “Growth and responsibility go hand-in-hand, because today’s customers expect both,” Meszaros says.

“Communities demand it, and the technology, from scalable charging to next-generation fuels, is advancing rapidly.

“I believe the companies that integrate sustainability into their operations now will be the ones best positioned to thrive in the future.”",https://s44876.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Joe-Meszaros-2025-1024x683.png,N,,2025-10-21 08:56:50.503458

The agreement was announced in Hong Kong on the sidelines of the IATA World Sustainability Symposium at a ceremony hosted by Cathay Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer Alex McGowan, and Airbus President Asia Pacific Anand Stanley.

Under the terms of the partnership, the two companies will work to identify, evaluate and invest in projects that support the scaling of SAF production towards 2030 and beyond. Projects will be assessed based on their commercial viability, technological maturity, and potential for long-term offtake.

Scaling SAF adoption requires deep collaboration across the value chain, from policymakers and investors to SAF producers, airlines and customers. This co-investment agreement reflects the spirit of partnership with Airbus and Cathay teaming up to accelerate production capability for more meaningful impact.

Cathay’s Alex McGowan said: “SAF remains the most important lever for Cathay and the wider aviation industry to drive toward our common decarbonisation goals. This co-investment partnership with Airbus underscores our commitment to supporting a more scalable SAF industry in the near term. It complements our broader strategy of investing in the technologies and production capacity that can transform the industry in the long run, including our participation in the recently launched oneworld BEV SAF Fund. Meanwhile, we are also expanding SAF usage today through partnerships with like-minded organisations.”

Airbus’s Anand Stanley said: “This agreement reflects the shared commitment of Airbus and Cathay to make a real difference. The production and distribution of affordable SAF at scale requires an unprecedented cross-sectoral approach. Our partnership with Cathay is a concrete example of how we catalyse production in the most suitable locations to serve our customers.”

The partnership also includes collaboration to advocate for supportive SAF policies on both the supply and demand side across Asia. With the region’s strong potential in feedstock supply, production capacity, and its vibrant aviation market, Cathay and Airbus aim to leverage their global experience to help shape policies that make SAF more accessible and affordable in this part of the world.

Last month, Cathay also joined as a launch investor in the oneworld BEV SAF Fund, a joint initiative with other oneworld airlines and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the climate investment firm founded by Bill Gates. That fund focuses on novel, next-generation SAF technologies with the potential to scale significantly and reduce costs.

Key issues highlighted in the study include: Unfair Access: The concentration of SAF at major hubs means regional airports are under-served, preventing carriers from claiming necessary SAF credits.
Cost Distortions: Smaller airlines with less purchasing power face inflated costs due to opaque surcharges and bundled pricing.
Compliance Traps: Complex and inconsistent reporting rules disproportionately affect regional carriers who have fewer resources to manage them.
ERA Director General Montserrat Barriga said the situation could soon put some regional operators out of business.","The European Regions Airline Association (ERA) has issued a stark warning that the current implementation of the European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation is creating structural disadvantages for smaller regional carriers, potentially isolating remote communities and endangering vital air links.

An ERA meeting in Copenhagen earlier this year saw delegates challenge Eddy Liegeois, EU Head of Aviation Policy, over EU Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandates. And as members gather this week in Estoril, Portugal, for the Association’s General Assembly, the issue is likely to be high on the agenda.

The Association’s new study – titled “Cutting emissions without cutting connections: How to make ReFuelEU work for all of Europe’s airlines” – reveals that the supply of SAF is heavily concentrated at major aviation hubs, leaving many smaller, regional airports without access. This exposes Europe’s most remote communities to rising costs, complex compliance burdens, and the risk of reduced connectivity.

The ERA says that while the airline sector is fully committed to the goal of net zero emissions by 2050, the fragmented rollout of ReFuelEU risks penalising regional airlines and the communities that rely on their services.

Under the Destination 2050 roadmap, SAF is expected to deliver the largest share of aviation’s emission reductions, with ReFuelEU requiring suppliers to blend increasing shares of the fuel, starting at 2% in 2025 and rising to 70% by 2050.

However, ERA members report that the early implementation is fragmented and unfair, forcing airlines to reconsider and redesign their network viability.

Key issues highlighted in the study include:

Unfair Access: The concentration of SAF at major hubs means regional airports are under-served, preventing carriers from claiming necessary SAF credits.

Cost Distortions: Smaller airlines with less purchasing power face inflated costs due to opaque surcharges and bundled pricing.

Compliance Traps: Complex and inconsistent reporting rules disproportionately affect regional carriers who have fewer resources to manage them.

Operational Risks: The Article 5 “anti-tankering rule,” intended to stop airlines from carrying extra fuel to avoid refuelling at higher-cost destinations, is creating unintended safety and cost issues on essential lifeline routes, particularly for smaller aircraft, without providing clear environmental benefits.

ERA Director General Montserrat Barriga said the situation could soon put some regional operators out of business.

“Europe’s green transition cannot come at the cost of territorial regional cohesion,” she added. “If ReFuelEU continues on its current path, Europe risks seeing airlines go bankrupt and losing vital air connectivity.”

The ERA is now calling on EU policymakers to urgently revise the ReFuelEU Regulation. They urge the commission to ensure that SAF is scaled up fairly and efficiently across all regions and to align the regulation’s implementation with the funding priorities of the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP).

A revised framework, the association argues, would accelerate SAF deployment, strengthen competition, deliver genuine emissions reductions, and protect Europe’s essential air connectivity.",https://www.laranews.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1098_COL_MONTSERRAT_HR-1024x697.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 06:56:35.407402

“Lithium-powered devices are safe when handled properly, but they can pose a risk if damaged or packed incorrectly.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has launched Travel Smart with Lithium Batteries, a global campaign promoting safe travel with mobile phones, laptops, power banks, and other lithium-powered devices.

Running across IATA’s website and social media platforms, the campaign offers seven simple rules for handling these items safely when flying. Airlines, airports, and travel partners can also access white-label materials for use across their own channels.

Recent IATA passenger survey results show that travellers are increasingly carrying multiple electronic devices – 83 per cent bring a phone, 60 per cent a laptop, and 44 per cent a power bank. Yet, despite 93 per cent claiming to know the rules, many misunderstand key regulations. Half incorrectly believe small lithium-powered devices can be checked in, while 45 per cent think power banks can go in checked luggage. A third are unaware of power limits for batteries or spares.

To address this, the campaign highlights seven key guidelines: carry all battery-powered items in hand luggage, never pack them in checked bags, protect loose batteries, check airline rules and battery watt-hours, and immediately alert crew if a device is hot or damaged.

The multilingual campaign will be rolled out industry-wide, with airlines and airports encouraged to share its digital assets. A short animated video has also been produced to communicate the rules in a clear and engaging format.

Common items powered by lithium batteries include mobile phones, laptops, tablets, cameras, e-readers, smartwatches, headphones, portable speakers, grooming tools, e-cigarettes, hearing aids, and small power tools.

“Lithium-powered devices are safe when handled properly, but they can pose a risk if damaged or packed incorrectly. As more travellers fly with these devices, our Travel Smart with Lithium Batteries campaign will help airlines educate their passengers on the simple rules they must keep in mind when travelling with the electronic devices that have become an essential part of their daily lives,” said Nick Careen, IATA’s senior vice president for operations, safety and security.",https://ttgasia.2017.ttgasia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/IATA-animated-video-screengrab-640.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 04:00:51.453052

The pellet industry utilizes residuals from the lumber industry and woody biomass located in the Southeast region’s plentiful pine forests.
They don’t burn coal anymore, and a large portion of the U.K. is running on wood pellets.
“That would not make financial sense, to turn the forest into pellets.” Smith explained that responsible forest management requires the thinning of forests to keep them healthy by allowing light to reach the forest floor, preserving animal habitats and reducing wildfire risk.
“Wood pellet production is carbon neutral and compatible with advanced conversion pathways.”","As airlines pursue decarbonization, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has emerged as the most viable option. Airlines including Delta, United and American have set goals to replace their conventional, fossil-based jet fuel with SAF. Meeting lofty goals will require a diverse array of feedstocks, and wood fiber and pellets are promising candidates.

At the 2025 North American Sustainable Aviation Fuel Conference, two panelists shared their perspectives on this new market for forest residues. The panel, titled “Decentralized SAF Innovation with Forest and Regional Resources,” featured panelists including Darrell Smith, executive director of the U.S. Industrial Pellet Association, and Eric Schenck, executive director of the Forest Resources Council in Minnesota.

Forests at Risk

One theme shared by both presenters was the crucial need for more industries that will utilize wood waste. Smith explained that the lion’s share of the U.S. industrial pellet industry is located in the Southeast, with 33 mills spread across 11 states, supplying 5,000 jobs across the U.S. The pellet industry utilizes residuals from the lumber industry and woody biomass located in the Southeast region’s plentiful pine forests. The paper industry was historically major employer in the Southeast, also known as the “Paper Basket” due to how quickly trees grow in the warm climate. In recent years, however, the paper industry has shrunk, depriving many communities of a keystone employer.

Smith explained that the declining number of paper plants could indirectly cause deforestation. About 86% of forests in the area are owned privately, so if the owners cannot find someone to use their wood or a way to make money off of the land they own, they may consider selling it to a developer to build a strip mall or housing development. “These aren’t old growth forests, these aren’t national parks; this is land that is meant to grow pine trees to be used as an agricultural product, and [it’s] been doing it for a very long time,” Smith said.

All U.S.-manufactured industrial pellets are exported for heat and power generation around the world—primarily to Europe and Japan—meaning that currently, none of them are currently used in the U.S. “We’re dispatchable energy in Europe,” he said. “The U.K., for instance, is totally off coal. They don’t burn coal anymore, and a large portion of the U.K. is running on wood pellets. My employee who lives in York, England—his house would go dark without wood pellets.”

Shipped by the boatload, the industry pelletizes tons of waste wood material that the lumber industry cannot use, including mill residues, treetops, limbs, thinnings and lower-quality wood. “We’re not going out into a forest and clear cutting them,” he said. “That would not make financial sense, to turn the forest into pellets.” Smith explained that responsible forest management requires the thinning of forests to keep them healthy by allowing light to reach the forest floor, preserving animal habitats and reducing wildfire risk. The biomass is pelletized for transportation because it makes the material more energy dense.

Smith explained that USIPA met with the Trump administration twice in the two weeks before the conference to ensure that industrial pellets are included in the $750 billion worth of energy that the European Union had committed to buying. “We want to keep sending these pellets overseas, because it’s a very valuable market for us,” he said. However, USIPA would like to find a domestic market for industrial pellets as well. Industrial pellet production has increased fivefold since 2012 and intends to keep growing, according to Smith. “Every time I talk to a state forestry [organization] since I’ve had this job for six months, the first thing out of their mouth is, ‘We need to build more pellet mills because we really need more [of them], it’s one of the only solutions to this declining paper market,’” he said.

Although it may seem counterintuitive, creating markets for woody biomass is crucial to reducing deforestation. Because 43% more wood is grown than removed each year, woody biomass in pellet form has great potential for SAF production, Smith said.

The U.S. can sustainably produce an additional 63 million dry tons per year of woody biomass, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Smith added that the DOE also estimates that approximately 2 billion to 5 billion gallons per year of SAF production could be possible from woody biomass. “Forestry residues are one of only a few sustainable scalable feedstocks that can contribute millions of gallons,” he said. “Wood pellet production is carbon neutral and compatible with advanced conversion pathways.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/i_Stock_1816525962_8df5296650.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 04:00:57.812660

The company revealed Cascade LF to customers last month and is quoting it now incorporating the Linear NRU. The Linear NRU enables Cascade LF to achieve even higher methane recovery performance at a lower cost. These improvements are made possible when this new intellectual property is combined with the improvements achieved through the company’s other patent applications filed within the last twelve months. As such, the Linear NRU builds upon the previously announced Cascade LF innovations, reinforcing the company’s technology leadership in the production of biomethane or renewable natural gas (RNG). Higher performance and lower cost systems enable RNG project developers and owners to enhance revenue generating RNG output from their assets while minimizing upfront investment, making RNG projects more accessible and scalable.

“This patent filing marks another important milestone in our commitment to customer-focused innovation and relentless pursuit of improving the state-of-the-art of technology in our industry,” said Brad Douville, CEO of Greenlane. “We took direct input from our customers to make a great product even better—pushing the boundaries of methane recovery while driving costs down further. Our goal continues to be to make meaningful technology enhancements that will set our customers up for success by giving them the tools they need to extract maximum value from their waste resources. We are now quoting our Cascade LF products incorporating the Linear NRU, targeting the first system delivery before the end of 2026.”

Greenlane’s Linear NRU technology is based on equilibrium pressure swing adsorption (PSA) principles. Conventional equilibrium PSA NRUs use multiple adsorption beds and internal recycling of recompressed gas. Greenlane’s innovation, incorporated into its Linear NRU, is a step-wise gas enrichment process that eliminates wasteful internal gas recycling while also using fewer and smaller adsorption beds. The result is lower operating and capital costs and higher methane recovery. For landfill gas containing increasingly higher levels of nitrogen, Greenlane’s modular product design employs additional adsorption beds plus compression in a staged configuration that preserves the linear approach and high methane recovery over the range. The best results are achieved when Cascade LF is paired with landfill wellfield monitoring and controls to maximize methane collection and minimize fugitive methane emissions and nitrogen levels in the landfill gas.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Greenlane_Logo_New_374f9ed6e2.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 04:01:01.498061

When we speak of sustainability in aviation, our recent focus must be on sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. This is indeed a complex and multifaceted challenge that demands co-operation and collaboration amongst a wide array of stakeholders, including governments, airlines, fuel suppliers, industry partners, and the traveling public. In Hong Kong, we are taking decisive steps to develop a SAF industry and promote the use of it at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA). In our view, it is of utmost importance that we join hands to scale up the production of SAF, as we all know that it is currently the only practical means for international aviation to decarbonise.

The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government is dedicated to fostering a robust SAF supply and its supply chain in collaboration with Mainland authorities and local enterprises, from upstream raw material collection to the establishment of production plants and large-scale production and supply. Given Hong Kong's close proximity to the Chinese Mainland, which has the largest supply of used cooking oil, we are leveraging this advantage to create a significant SAF supply for Hong Kong. Moreover, as 100 per cent neat SAF cannot be uplifted to aircraft at this moment, we are actively exploring the construction of a SAF blending facility right here in Hong Kong. This facility aims to support the provision of competitively priced SAF-blended jet fuel in the long run, hence raising the competitiveness of Hong Kong's SAF industry. By doing so, we also aim to strengthen the bargaining power of airlines operating from HKIA, ultimately fostering HKIA's competitiveness as an international aviation hub.

On this floor, I know that Cathay Pacific Group has been leading and is very dedicated in pushing forward the use of SAF. Of course, we would work closely with Cathay as our close partner. We are also mindful of the pragmatic and practical considerations faced by different airlines in Hong Kong. In a way, we hope to create a critical mass and to achieve and secure a reasonably priced SAF supply and production to enable us to create a robust supply chain for SAF in Hong Kong. With the above measures in place and subject to regional SAF industry development, we adopt a vision to achieve a SAF consumption ratio of 1 per cent to 2 per cent for flights departing from HKIA by 2030 as a starting point to drive momentum.

""The Chief Executive's Policy Address"" announced just last month includes quite some paragraphs on how we would strive ourselves to achieve the SAF consumption target. We, in a recent briefing for our legislature, disclosed the target that I mentioned just now. I received a lot of feedback asking whether Hong Kong could set a more aggressive target. Replying to the stakeholders and the legislative councillors was that we want to be pragmatic and realistic. We want to put it into action. So, we set a target which we hope to achieve. That is a starting point, and this should not preclude or hinder us from setting an even more aggressive target along the way.

Apart from the industry and aviation partners, I think public education is also very important. As we take people along from places to places, the travelling public need to raise their awareness for green aviation. It helps build a collective understanding of the role SAF plays in reducing aviation's carbon footprint. The Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK) will, for instance, launch targeted publicity and promotional campaigns to raise awareness among the public and corporations about the importance of SAF, and the need for everyone to do their part. By engaging communities and businesses, we aim to create a culture of sustainability that supports long-term environmental goals. I think this culture of sustainability is the basic, core element and spirit that IATA has also been promoting around the globe.

Speaking of AAHK, I am proud to highlight their unwavering commitment to sustainability. Apart from SAF that I spoke of a lot, together with key aviation-related business partners, AAHK is dedicated to achieving Net Zero Carbon by 2050, a bold step making HKIA the world's greenest airport. Their efforts to embed sustainability into new developments at HKIA, integrate environmental best interests and practices, and address climate change and resilience given the airport's coastal location have all gained significant momentum. Initiatives such as trialing renewable diesel, expanding the use of electric and autonomous vehicles on the Airport Island, as well as continuously upgrading its equipment by incorporating more energy-efficient installation and technologies reflect a holistic approach to sustainable development at HKIA.

We are all acutely aware that the journey to a sustainable future in the aviation sector is not a solo mission. It is a global challenge and mission that requires collaboration across borders, industries, and sectors. The HKSAR Government is committed to playing a pivotal role by leading, offering policy support, driving innovation and technology, and most importantly, cultivating an enabling environment for sustainable aviation. Our door is always open. We will maintain close communication with international organisations, airlines, the airport community, fuel suppliers and industry stakeholders to tackle pressing challenges and difficulties. As Dr Thomsen (Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist of IATA, Dr Marie Owens Thomsen) just mentioned, it is not just saying when there is a will, there is a way. We have to create ways so as to make our will works. It is the time not for words, but for action.

Last but not least, international collaboration is paramount in this endeavor. No single city, country, or organisation can achieve net zero alone. We must share knowledge, pool resources and align our strategies to create a unified global response to the climate crisis. We have been facing very frequent super typhoons over the past weeks and months in Hong Kong, which is quite unprecedented. Our airport and aviation community have been making our best efforts to respond, recover and resurrect, but nothing is more important than tackling this issue at the heart of the problem and do it with passion and determination. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is precisely why gatherings like this symposium are vital for fostering such partnerships.

I truly look forward to the rich discussions and innovative insights that will emerge from this symposium, sparking actionable outcomes. And with the talent and the dedication I see in this room, I am more than confident that we can turn the vision of net zero by 2050 into a reality. It's a goal championed by IATA, but it's a future we will build together.

Lastly, I wish you all productive, inspiring and impactful sessions ahead. Thank you very much.

The Reno facility was converted to SAF production in October 2024.
During the initial phase of production ramp-up, New Rise Reno operated at approximately 50% of nameplate capacity.
XCF said the New Rise Reno team has been reviewing the catalyst processing for SAF to meet nameplate capacity.
“We currently expect to resume SAF production as early as the first quarter of 2026, although we cannot assure you when SAF production will resume, and when it does resume, when or whether the Reno production facility will be able to produce SAF at full capacity,” XCF wrote in the quarterly report.","XCF Global Inc.’s biorefinery located near Reno, Nevada, could resume sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production as early as the first quarter of 2026, according a second quarter financial report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Oct. 16.

The biorefinery, currently known as New Rise Reno, was developed as a 50 MMgy renewable diesel plant, which began operations in 2022. Development of the facility was supported by loan guarantee awarded through the USDA’s 9003, Biorefinery, Renewable Chemical and Biodiesel Production Manufacturing Assistance Program, according to Greater Commercial Lending, which helped assemble the loan package that made the project possible. According to a 2017 USDA announcement, the facility at that time was being developed under the name Ryze Renewables Reno LLC.

The Reno facility was converted to SAF production in October 2024. XCF Global acquired the facility in February 2025 and later that month announced the plant had commenced production of neat SAF and renewable naphtha. Initial deliveries of both fuels began in March 2025. During the initial phase of production ramp-up, New Rise Reno operated at approximately 50% of nameplate capacity. XCF said the New Rise Reno team has been reviewing the catalyst processing for SAF to meet nameplate capacity.

According to the second quarter report, until SAF production reaches nameplate capacity, New Rise Reno is not deemed to be an operating facility and classifies as under construction until final project acceptance under New Rise’s license agreement with Axens North America under the original intention of the SAF conversion. Such final project acceptance has not yet been completed.

“Due to the conversion to SAF and associated testing of the facility, we have observed variable operating performance which has impacted the ability of the plant to operate at full capacity,” XCF wrote in the quarterly report.

While ramp-up processes are being undertaken and until final plant acceptable, XCF said it has made the determination to temporarily produce and sell renewable diesel, a byproduct of SAF production, which can be achieved at approximately 2,000 barrels per day, which is approximately 20% below nameplate capacity, and without any additional modifications to the facility. “Management regards the production of renewable diesel as an interim derivative during the ramp up process of the ongoing SAF conversion process,” the company said.

New Rise Reno in May 2025 began selling renewable diesel under a supply and offtake agreement with Phillipps 66. According to the second quarter report, New Rise Reno produced, in aggregate, approximately 1.9 million gallons of neat SAF, renewable diesel and renewable naphtha during the three months ended June 30.

“We currently expect to resume SAF production as early as the first quarter of 2026, although we cannot assure you when SAF production will resume, and when it does resume, when or whether the Reno production facility will be able to produce SAF at full capacity,” XCF wrote in the quarterly report. “Any delay beyond the first quarter of 2026 in our ability to resume SAF or renewable diesel production and/or any delay in our ability to operate the Reno production facility at full nameplate capacity for SAF production will adversely affect our revenues and profitability.”

By ensuring that our guiding principles form the backbone of SAF policy going forward, we will help deliver a SAF industry that is more than just low-carbon, but one that is on a flight path toward true sustainability.","Hundreds of people from around the globe traveled to the Twin Cities last month for the North American Sustainable Aviation Fuel Conference and Expo(link is external). There, attendees discussed the future of SAF technology and policy. This conversation was driven primarily by industry experts, corporate decisionmakers, agribusiness representatives and biofuels researchers.

Also there? Friends of the Mississippi River.

Two members of FMR’s Water Program, myself and Trevor Russell, attended the conference. Our goal — when mingling with fellow attendees or participating in panels and presentations — was to share FMR’s perspective: That the industry needs to take a broad view of what it means to be “sustainable,” and account for the impact any new fuel might have on our air, land and water.

We were there, in short, to be the voice for the river.

Here are three things we discovered from our time at the conference.

1) Water and biodiversity aren’t currently top of mind

Throughout the conference, we heard scant mention of clean water, healthy soil or biodiversity. When we spoke with other conference attendees about FMR’s perspective on SAF, multiple people admitted they had never really considered how it could affect water quality.

That might seem surprising, but there’s a practical reason for this. The legal definition of SAF — the criteria the fuel needs to meet in order to qualify for tax credits (more on these below) — only references greenhouse gas emissions. If the fuel has less than half the carbon emissions of traditional jet fuel, then it qualifies as ""sustainable aviation fuel.""

But in our view, just being lower carbon is not the same thing as being sustainable. That’s why it’s important for advocates like FMR to keep pushing for broad definitions of sustainability in SAF, while also urging investments in the most environmentally friendly fuel sources we have, such as winter-hardy oilseeds.

2) Minnesota is likely to be a national hub of SAF activity

Over and over, we heard how Minnesota is expected to be a national leader in this new industry.

The state has the input materials (meaning, what the fuel is made out of) in its agricultural crops and forest products, a major airport with MSP, and a highly trained and educated workforce. Critically, there is also a state tax credit for producers of SAF. (In fact, the Star Tribune recently highlighted SAF(link is external) as one of the ""Midwestern ideas shaping the future.)

Under current conditions, however, SAF is still much more expensive than traditional jet fuel. In order for early adoption of SAF to make economic sense for airlines, they need both a federal boost and a state boost.

A federal credit does exist, though as we mentioned earlier, they’re based only on greenhouse gas emissions. That makes state policy a powerful lever for establishing stronger sustainability parameters.

Even if the federal government rolls back environmental protections, SAF companies are going to have to meet the more stringent state laws if they want to benefit from all the available incentives.

3) Now is the time to shape SAF's future

Right now, there are only a handful of SAF production facilities throughout the country, and the number of SAF-powered flights that have happened in the U.S. is quite small. (The Delta flight powered in part by winter camelina is one example.) Even the experts can’t agree on what they think the next five or 10 years will look like, because there are still so many unknowns.

SAF companies are waiting for more stability in state and federal policy before committing billions of dollars to building new production facilities. Policy is shaping the way this new industry rolls out, and how truly sustainable it will end up being.

How we'll build on what we learned

The North American SAF Conference allowed us to peek behind the curtain to hear what the industry decision-makers are saying. It’s clear they see Minnesota as an emerging leader in the SAF space, and that state policy will be influential in shaping what happens next.

Importantly, we also shared our message of clean water and healthy rivers directly with decisionmakers, researchers and leaders. We were really encouraged by the thoughtful questions and positive response from attendees.

But concrete public policy decisions and industry commitments are where the rubber meets the runway.

FMR will continue to advocate for clean water, soil health, habitat and pollinators in state and federal SAF conversations. By ensuring that our guiding principles form the backbone of SAF policy going forward, we will help deliver a SAF industry that is more than just low-carbon, but one that is on a flight path toward true sustainability.",https://fmr.org/files/2510-saf_conference-meghan_and_trevor-chloe_piekkola__danielle_piekarski__bbi_international.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 19:00:41.615573

,,2025-10-20 21:06:23+00:00,The Straits Times,Jurong Island firms turn to greener growth opportunities amid oil and gas sector's transformation,Shabana Begum,,,,,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/jurong-island-firms-turn-to-greener-growth-opportunities-amid-oil-and-gas-sectors-transformation,"SINGAPORE – On Jurong Island, gas and chemicals storage provider Advario Asia-Pacific has been expanding beyond its fossil fuel focus towards greener pastures, by investing in infrastructure to store cleaner fuels.
The Dutch company is one of several companies in the emissions-intensive energy and chemicals hub of Jurong Island that are starting to make the green shift.
Around a third of Singapore’s greenhouse gas emissions come from the refining and petrochemicals sector, with over 100 companies on Jurong Island.
“By scaling innovative low-carbon solutions in Singapore, companies can meet sustainability standards, tap regional demand and export new technologies globally,” said JTC and EDB.
The 2022 Energy Sector Manpower Survey by the Energy Market Authority showed that Singapore’s clean energy workforce is projected to increase by 80 per cent by 2032, reaching around 2,700 workers.","SINGAPORE – On Jurong Island, gas and chemicals storage provider Advario Asia-Pacific has been expanding beyond its fossil fuel focus towards greener pastures, by investing in infrastructure to store cleaner fuels.

The company has set aside tank space equivalent to 34 Olympic-size swimming pools to store and blend sustainable aviation fuel –

a less pollutive alternative to jet fuel.

The Dutch company is one of several companies in the emissions-intensive energy and chemicals hub of Jurong Island that are starting to make the green shift.

Around a third of Singapore’s greenhouse gas emissions come from the refining and petrochemicals sector, with over 100 companies on Jurong Island.

Despite the geopolitical headwinds confronting climate action in some countries, recent developments have also pointed to the inevitable transformation of this pollutive sector, which companies like Advario are taking notice of.

“Globally, tightening climate regulations and rising demand for sustainable products are accelerating decarbonisation,” said Singapore’s industrial developer, JTC Corporation (JTC), and the Economic Development Board (EDB) in response to queries from The Straits Times.

For example,

Singapore’s carbon tax levied on large emitters

here is on the upward trajectory, and could go up from the current $25 per tonne to between $50 and $80 per tonne by 2030.

The European Union is also implementing a regulation that makes companies importing certain emissions-intensive goods into Europe pay for the carbon emissions created from producing these products.

Several multinational companies with a Singapore presence have started to feel the implications of these trends.

In 2024, oil giant Shell sold its energy and chemicals park on Pulau Bukom and Jurong Island, as part of measures to boost its overall profitability and lower its carbon footprint worldwide.

As crude prices tumbled in 2025 , some global oil companies including Chevron, BP and ExxonMobil have announced thousands of job cuts. On Oct 1, ExxonMobil announced that it plans to reduce 10 per cent to 15 per cent of its workforce in Singapore by the end of 2027.

The energy and chemicals sector is a global industry, and Singapore is an open economy with leading positions in refining, trading and chemical production, said EDB’s vice-president of chemicals and materials, Ms Kelly Lai.

“Due to the global petrochemical downcycle, companies are reviewing their footprints globally, and we are not sheltered from these global developments,” she said.

“With any mature industry, we would expect to see some churn, and naturally then reinvestment and rejuvenation.”

As the energy and chemicals sector transforms, it will need to reimagine its business models, innovate processes, and adopt low-carbon technologies, JTC and EDB added.

Decarbonisation is a key part of Singapore’s growth strategy for the energy and chemicals sector – it enables companies to stay competitive and capture new markets, said EDB and JTC.

Companies on the island are combining immediate measures, such as improving the energy efficiency of industrial processes and deploying solar panels , with those that will take a longer time to scale and commercialise.

Advario is attempting to do this by diversifying its business model beyond fossil fuels to include low-carbon options, such as sustainable aviation fuel.

Its director of business development, Mr Kevin Jen, said: “With increasing societal awareness and stakeholder pressure, demand for traditional hydrocarbons is expected to decline gradually, driven in part by the wider adoption of electric vehicles, as well as transitional fuels in both the maritime and aviation sectors.”

Fossil fuels include naturally occurring compounds of hydrocarbons. While greener fuels are not yet commercially mature, the Dutch company, being family-owned, is able to take a longer-term perspective – one that balances sustainability with commercial discipline, Mr Jen added.

Power generation companies Keppel, PacificLight Power and YTL PowerSeraya are also studying ways of capturing planet-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) from power plants, to identify the specific infrastructure needed to make carbon capture and storage a reality in Singapore.

EDB’s Ms Lai also pointed out that, despite the recent cutbacks, Shell and ExxonMobil still continue to maintain a significant presence in Singapore.

Singapore is home to ExxonMobil’s largest manufacturing site and the company has just started up new production facilities, she said.

Shell and ExxonMobil have since 2024 also been leading a consortium to study the feasibility of capturing CO2 in Singapore for storage in other countries. The aim is to develop a carbon capture project that can permanently store 2.5 million tonnes of CO2 a year by 2030.

“By scaling innovative low-carbon solutions in Singapore, companies can meet sustainability standards, tap regional demand and export new technologies globally,” said JTC and EDB.

On a broader level, Singapore had seen the writing on the wall for the oil and gas sector, and began to move on this front a few years ago.

In 2021, it launched a plan to transform Jurong Island into a sustainable energy and chemicals hub, with 2030 targets to raise the production of sustainable goods, ensure that local refineries and crackers are highly energy efficient, and realise carbon capture.

The authorities will be providing updates on this , including additional announcements, at the upcoming Singapore International Energy Week on Oct 27.

Ms Ni kki Kemp, director of the Singapore Green Finance Centre at the Singapore Management University, noted that while the Republic may not suffer widespread job losses due to changes in the sector , it faces a “skills transition challenge”.

Those affected will need reskilling for alternative occupations, leading to additional transition costs, she said.

For example , job functions in electricity transmission and distribution, low-carbon alternatives, solar energy and smart grids are expected to experience significant growth, added Ms Kemp.

She cited a 2024 study which found that, globally, the petrochemical sector’s demand growth is set to weaken over the next 10 years. Roles focused on oil and gas refining and traditional petrochemical production are likely to be restructured and reduced.

“New job opportunities may not emerge in the same location or timeframe as those that have been lost. Therefore, effective employment planning is crucial as part of the transition,” she added.

The 2022 Energy Sector Manpower Survey by the Energy Market Authority showed that Singapore’s clean energy workforce is projected to increase by 80 per cent by 2032, reaching around 2,700 workers. The power sector is also expected to expand by 800 workers during the same period .

Ms Kemp observed that Jurong Island’s transformation is under way with significant technical and governance hurdles.

She noted that carbon capture is a highly technical solution that is currently being tested, but not on a big enough scale. The commercial viability of hydrogen as a clean fuel remains questionable, she added.

She said: “A credible energy transition in Singapore includes a commitment to decarbonise Jurong Island industries, ensuring decarbonisation is permanent, rather than moving operations elsewhere.”

This requires transparency in having a company’s green achievements verified, having public dashboards to track how firms are progressing with their climate goals, and company disclosure about their investment in clean technology, she added.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/09e3a76f9b8f32f425287762a3ba3df8d3628b22a580e99d0988ccea119fd5a9,N,,2025-10-20 18:00:03.328600

Reconciliations of the non–U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) measures included at the end of this press release.

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin

Net interest income was $29.3 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $27.3 million for the second quarter of 2025. The $1.9 million increase was due to a $3.2 million increase in interest income, offset by a $1.2 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was due mainly to a $2.4 million increase in interest and fees on loans. The increase in interest expense was due mainly to a $1.0 million increase in interest on deposits.

The net interest margin (“NIM”) was 2.98% for the third quarter of 2025, an increase of 6 basis points from 2.92% for the second quarter of 2025. The NIM expansion included a 6 basis point increase in the yield on average interest-earning assets and a 2 basis point decrease in the overall cost of funds. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased to 5.85% for the third quarter of 2025 from 5.79% for the second quarter of 2025 driven by a 9 basis point increase in the yield on average loans to 6.12%. Average loans represented 83.3% of average interest-earning assets in the third quarter of 2025, as compared to 84.5% in the second quarter of 2025.

The average cost of funds decreased to 3.12% for the third quarter of 2025 from 3.14% for the second quarter of 2025, due to a 3 basis point decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits, and a 9 basis point decrease in the average cost of total borrowings. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased to 3.63% for the third quarter of 2025 from 3.66% for the second quarter of 2025. The overall funding mix for the third quarter of 2025 remained relatively unchanged from the second quarter of 2025 with average total interest-bearing deposits representing 89.4% of average interest-bearing liabilities and average noninterest-bearing deposits representing 16.6% of average total deposits. The spot rate for total deposits was 2.97% at September 30, 2025.

Provision for Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses was $625,000 for the third quarter of 2025 compared to $2.4 million for the second quarter of 2025. The third quarter of 2025 provision for credit losses reflected a provision for loan loss of $750,000 due mainly to net loan growth, and a decrease in provision for unfunded commitments of $125,000 due to lower volume of unfunded commitments. The third quarter provision also took into consideration factors such as changes in the outlook for economic conditions and market interest rates, and changes in credit quality metrics, including changes in loans 30-89 days past due, nonperforming loans, special mention and substandard loans during the period. Net charge-offs totaled $6.9 million in the third quarter and related almost entirely to a commercial construction loan, of which $6.6 million of this credit loss was reserved in prior periods, and the borrower filed for bankruptcy this quarter. Net charge-offs on an annualized basis represented 0.84% of average loans for the third quarter of 2025 compared to 0.42% for the second quarter of 2025.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2025 was $3.3 million, a decrease of $5.2 million from $8.5 million for the second quarter of 2025. The decrease was mostly due to the second quarter of 2025 including other income of $5.2 million for the receipt of ERC funds from the IRS. There were no such ERC amounts received or associated advisory costs recognized during the third quarter of 2025. In addition, other income increased $148,000 due to higher equity investment income of $498,000, offset by lower recoveries on fully charged-off acquired loans of $350,000.

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2025 was $18.7 million, a decrease of $1.8 million from $20.5 million for the second quarter of 2025. The decrease was mainly due to lower legal and professional expenses of $1.5 million, including $1.2 million of ERC advisory costs incurred in the second quarter of 2025. Salaries and employee benefits also decreased by $480,000, of which $330,000 related to executive management transitions recognized in the prior quarter. The efficiency ratio was 57.36% for the third quarter of 2025, compared to 57.22% for the second quarter of 2025.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate was 23.5% for the third quarter of 2025 and 27.8% for the second quarter of 2025. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2025 was due mostly to a change in California tax law (Senate Bill 132), which changes the way banks and financial institutions apportion income for California tax purposes. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 is estimated to be in the range of 26% to 27%.

Balance Sheet

At September 30, 2025, total assets were $4.2 billion, a $118.4 million, or 2.9%, increase compared to June 30, 2025, and a $218.0 million, or 5.5%, increase compared to September 30, 2024.

Loan and Securities Portfolio

Loans held for investment (""HFI"") totaled $3.3 billion as of September 30, 2025, an increase of $67.9 million, or 8.3% annualized, compared to June 30, 2025, and an increase of $210.7 million, or 6.8%, compared to September 30, 2024. The third quarter of 2025 net loan growth included $187.8 million in originations with an average yield of 6.70%. The net increase from June 30, 2025 was largely due to net increases of $47.9 million in single-family residential (""SFR"") mortgage loans, $13.2 million in commercial real estate (""CRE"") loans, and $8.4 million in commercial and industrial (""C&I"") loans. The loan to deposit ratio was 98.1% at September 30, 2025, compared to 101.5% at June 30, 2025 and 100.0% at September 30, 2024.

As of September 30, 2025, available for sale securities (""AFS"") totaled $410.6 million, a decrease of $2.5 million from June 30, 2025, primarily related to maturities and paydowns of $62.3 million, offset by purchases of $58.3 million during the third quarter of 2025. As of September 30, 2025, net unrealized losses totaled $20.5 million, a $2.6 million decrease when compared to net unrealized losses of $23.1 million as of June 30, 2025.

Deposits

Total deposits were $3.4 billion as of September 30, 2025, an increase of $178.3 million, or 22.2% annualized, compared to June 30, 2025 and an increase of $274.3 million, or 8.9%, compared to September 30, 2024. The increase during the third quarter of 2025 was due to a $171.7 million increase in interest-bearing deposits coupled with a $6.6 million increase in noninterest-bearing deposits. The increase in interest-bearing deposits included increases in wholesale time deposits of $84.3 million, retail time deposits of $57.4 million, and interest-bearing non-maturity deposits of $30.0 million. Wholesale time deposits were raised to repay $50.0 million in maturing FHLB advances. Noninterest-bearing deposits totaled $550.5 million, or 16.4% of total deposits at September 30, 2025 compared to $543.9 million, or 17.1% of total deposits at June 30, 2025.

Credit Quality

Nonperforming assets totaled $54.3 million, or 1.29% of total assets, at September 30, 2025, down from $61.0 million, or 1.49% of total assets, at June 30, 2025. Nonperforming assets included $8.8 million other real estate owned (“OREO”) (included in “accrued interest and other assets”) at September 30, 2025 and $4.2 million at June 30, 2025. The increase in OREO in the third quarter related to the foreclosure of 2 SBA loans with $3.7 million guaranteed. Accordingly, including the SBA guarantees, OREO exposure totaled $5.1 million at September 30, 2025.

Nonperforming loans totaled $45.4 million at September 30, 2025, down from $56.8 million at June 30, 2025. The $11.3 million decrease in nonperforming loans during the third quarter of 2025 was due to $6.9 million in net charge-offs, $5.0 million of loans migrating back to accrual status, $1.2 million in payoffs and paydowns, and $970,000 moving to OREO. These decreases were partially offset by additions to nonaccrual loans of $2.8 million.

Special mention loans, also referred to as criticized loans, totaled $49.3 million, or 1.49% of total loans, at September 30, 2025, down from $91.3 million, or 2.82% of total loans, at June 30, 2025. The $42.0 million decrease was primarily due to the upgrade of one $44.4 million completed construction loan, downgrades to substandard-rated loans totaling $8.4 million, and payoffs and paydowns totaling $2.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by the downgrade of loans to special mention totaling $10.8 million and $2.8 million in balance increases. As of September 30, 2025, all special mention loans were paying current.

Substandard loans, also referred to as classified loans, totaled $76.9 million at September 30, 2025, down from $91.0 million at June 30, 2025. The $14.1 million decrease in substandard loans during the third quarter was primarily due to payoffs and paydowns of $16.6 million, net charge-offs of $6.9 million, upgrades to pass-rated loans of $5.0 million, and transfers to OREO of $970,000. These decreases were partially offset by downgrades of loans to substandard of $15.4 million. Of the total substandard loans at September 30, 2025, there were $31.4 million on accrual status.

30-89 day delinquent loans, excluding nonperforming loans, totaled $6.5 million, or 0.20% of total loans, at September 30, 2025, down from $18.0 million, or 0.56% of total loans, at June 30, 2025. The $11.5 million decrease was mainly due to $13.0 million in loans returning to current status and $2.4 million in loans migrating to nonaccrual status, offset by $4.0 million in new delinquent loans.

As of September 30, 2025, the allowance for credit losses totaled $45.4 million and was comprised of an allowance for loan losses of $44.9 million and a reserve for unfunded commitments of $504,000 (included in “accrued interest and other liabilities”). This compares to the allowance for credit losses of $51.6 million, comprised of an allowance for loan losses of $51.0 million and a reserve for unfunded commitments of $629,000 at June 30, 2025. The $6.2 million decrease in the allowance for credit losses for the third quarter of 2025 was due to net charge-offs of $6.9 million, offset by a $625,000 provision for credit losses. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans HFI decreased to 1.36% at September 30, 2025, compared to 1.58% at June 30, 2025, due mainly to net charge-offs which were specific reserves at June 30, 2025. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans HFI was 98.70% at September 30, 2025, up from 89.79% at June 30, 2025.

Shareholders' Equity

At September 30, 2025, total shareholders' equity was $514.3 million, a $3.3 million decrease compared to June 30, 2025, and a $4.6 million increase compared to September 30, 2024. The decrease in shareholders' equity for the third quarter of 2025 was due mostly to common stock repurchases totaling $12.5 million and common stock cash dividends paid of $2.8 million, offset by net income of $10.1 million and lower net unrealized losses on AFS securities of $1.6 million.

The increase in shareholders' equity for the last twelve months was due to net income of $26.2 million, lower net unrealized losses on AFS securities of $1.6 million, and equity compensation activity of $2.2 million, offset by common stock repurchases totaling $14.0 million and common stock cash dividends paid of $11.4 million. Book value per share and tangible book value per share (1) increased to $30.18 and $25.89 at September 30, 2025, up from $29.25 and $25.11 at June 30, 2025 and up from $28.81 and $24.64 at September 30, 2024.

Return on Average Tangible Common Equity

Management measures return on average tangible common equity (“ROATCE”) to assess the Company’s capital strength and business performance and believes this is helpful to investors as an additional tool for further understanding our performance. Tangible equity excludes goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights) and is reviewed by banking and financial institution regulators when assessing a financial institution’s capital adequacy. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.

NORWELL, Mass., Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DIH Holding US, Inc. (“DIH” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:DHAI), a global provider of advanced robotic devices used in physical rehabilitation, which incorporate visual stimulation in an interactive manner to enable clinical research and intensive functional rehabilitation and training in patients with walking impairments, reduced balance and/or impaired arm and hand functions, today announced financial results for the fiscal 2025 fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2025.

Recent Highlights

Revenue of $62.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, representing a decrease of 2.5% over the prior year

Device revenue of $49.7 million and service revenue of $12.0 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, representing a decrease of 2.8% and an increase of 8.4%, respectively over the prior year

Negative operating cash flow of $4.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2025

“DIH remains committed to driving innovation and delivering value for patients and healthcare providers,” said Jason Chen, Chairman and CEO of DIH. “During this year, we made meaningful progress across our key strategic initiatives while maintaining our focus on operational discipline. As we look forward to the results of the NASDAQ hearing panel regarding our listing status held on October 16, 2025, our team is committed to positioning DIH for long-term success.”

Financial Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2025

The overall decrease in revenue was primarily due to a change in product mix, where many customers purchased a similar number of devices but with a lower average sales price than the prior year mix. This change in mix was offset by a price increase implemented during fiscal year 2024, and effective for devices sold in fiscal year 2025. Services revenues increased slightly during the year, as the Company continues to focus on expanding its service department in established regions. Overall, as the product mix shifted to smaller and lower priced products, the revenues decreased slightly, year over year.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on our net sales for the year ended March 31, 2025, resulting in a decrease of approximately $0.2 million. This was mainly driven by fluctuations in Euro valuations throughout the period.

Gross profit for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, was $32.2 million, an increase of 8.2% compared to the prior period. The increase was driven by a cost of goods decrease of $4.1 million, of which $5.3 million was due to the change in product mix, as the devices produced for delivery to customers had a lesser cost basis, and the impact of a lesser inventory reserve recorded in the current fiscal year, as compared to the prior year. The decreased reserve in the current year is the result of a stabilized current inventory on hand, with significantly less identified materials where excess inventory was identified. The decrease in devices costs was offset by an increase cost of services for providing routine and on demand service requests of $1.2 million between periods.

Selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended March 31, 2025 increased by $4.2 million, or 16.3%, to $30.0 million. The increase was driven by a $1.9 million increase in personnel expenses related to compensation including an increase in performance-based compensation, merit increases to salaries, and additions in headcount as well as a $0.5 million increase in stock compensation. In addition, there was a $1.1 million in impairment of related party receivable in the year ended March 31, 2025 due to a settlement of related party balances. The provision for credit losses reflected a $0.3 million release in fiscal 2025 compared to a $1.0 million release in fiscal 2024, resulting in a $0.7 million increase in total expense in the year ended March 31, 2025.

Research and development costs for the year ended March 31, 2025 increased by $0.5 million, or 7.4%, to $7.1 million primarily due to increase in software costs.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, we discontinued the development and commercialization of the SafeGait product, resulting in an impairment loss of $0.6 million. We also ceased further development of capitalized software related to the HocoNet platform, resulting in an additional impairment loss of $1.5 million. There were no such impairments recognized during fiscal year 2024

Cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2025 totaled $1.9 million.

Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter Ended March 31, 2025

Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was $12.6 million, a decrease of 34.7% compared to the prior year period. The decrease in devices revenue was primarily driven by lower sales volume in EMEA. In EMEA, we sell our equipment through a distributor network across Europe. One of our largest sales partners, which primarily operates in Eastern Europe, has been impacted by wartime import restrictions resulting from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a minor unfavorable impact on our net sales in the three months ended March 31, 2025, resulting in a decrease of approximately $0.3 million.

Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was $6.0 million, a 30.4% decrease compared to the prior period which directly correlated to the product mix changes.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $7.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, a decrease of 8.7% compared to the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to $1.4 million of transaction costs incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2024 in connection with the business combination that did not recur, as well as $0.7 million of cost reductions from efficiency initiatives. These decreases were partially offset by a $1.1 million increase due to the impairment on related party receivables and a $0.5 million increase in performance-based compensation, merit increases to salaries, and additions in headcount.

Research and development expenses were $1.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, consistent with $1.9 million in the prior-year period. The slight decrease was due to lower personnel expenses related to salary and benefit partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expenses.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, we discontinued the development and commercialization of the SafeGait product, resulting in an impairment loss of $0.6 million. We also ceased further development of capitalized software related to the HocoNet platform, resulting in an additional impairment loss of $1.5 million.

Subsequent Events

After March 31, 2025, the Company paid the April 2025 scheduled redemption of the Original Debentures. On May 29, 2025, the Company and Five Narrow Lane amended the Securities Purchase Agreement. Under the amendment, the deferred May 1, 2025 redemption was settled through the issuance of 1,540,277 shares of Class A common stock, and the June 2025 redemption was settled in shares as provided in the Original Debentures. The amendment permits future monthly redemptions and interest to be settled in cash or in shares, and the holder waived the default related to the deferred May payment. Separately, the Company made a partial redemption in July 2025 and deferred later scheduled redemptions while finalizing its Annual Report on Form 10-K.

On August 7, 2025, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement pursuant to which it issued, in a private placement, senior secured convertible debentures with an aggregate principal amount of $2.2 million on an original-issue-discount basis, resulting in expected net proceeds of $1.9 million after estimated offering expenses. The debentures were structured to be funded in four tranches of gross proceeds. As of the date of these financial statements, $1.4 million has been funded under the first three tranches, and the remaining $0.5 million is expected to fund upon (a) the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, (b) delivery of a substantially complete draft Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, and (c) appointment of one additional independent director.

The debentures mature on September 21, 2026. No interest accrues during the first year; beginning the first day of the month after the first anniversary, interest is 8% per annum, payable monthly. The Company may extend the maturity by six months if specified conditions are met and six months of interest is prepaid and credited against future interest. The debentures are initially convertible at $0.25 per share, subject to adjustment and a 9.99% beneficial-ownership cap. Beginning October 1, 2025, monthly redemptions of $171 thousand are required; each monthly redemption may be satisfied in cash or, if conditions are met, in shares priced at the lesser of the then-current conversion price and 90% of the average of the five lowest VWAPs for the 10 consecutive trading days prior to the applicable monthly redemption date. The debentures are secured under the Company’s existing June 6, 2024 security arrangements. In connection with the financing, the Company issued warrants to purchase 8,888,888 shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of $0.25 per share, exercisable beginning February 1, 2026 and expiring February 1, 2030.

The agreements include a resale registration undertaking with filing and effectiveness timelines and liquidated damages if missed; a 90-day limitation on new issuances or registration filings after the resale registration becomes effective; a prohibition on variable-rate transactions while the debentures remain outstanding; an obligation to seek shareholder approval under Nasdaq rules to permit additional share issuances in connection with the debentures and warrants; and a commitment to include in the proxy proposals authorizing a reverse stock split to support listing compliance and amending certain June 6, 2024 and March 20, 2025 debentures to align their minimum base conversion price with the new debentures.

A 1-for-25 reverse stock split of the Company’s Class A common stock was approved by stockholders at a Special Meeting held on September 25, 2025. The final ratio was determined by the Board on September 26, 2025. The Company legally effected by filing a certificate of amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State on October 17, 2025. The Common Stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq Stock Market at market open on October 20, 2025. As a result, every twenty-five shares of Common Stock were converted into one share, decreasing issued and outstanding shares from approximately 52.3 million to 2.1 million as of the effective date. The par value and authorized shares remained unchanged.

On October 15, 2025 the Company entered into an equity line of credit agreement with Five Narrow Lane, L.P. (the “investor”) whereby the Company can issue and sell up to up to the lesser of (i) $22,000,000 in aggregate gross purchase price of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share, but shall not exceed 10,458,031 Common Shares (representing 19.99% of the voting power or number of Common Shares, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement). The shares can be purchased at 94% of the VWAP on the Business Day immediately preceding the VWAP Purchase Date but not less than $0.10 or such higher price as set forth by the Company in the VWAP Purchase Notice. In exchange for entering into the equity line of credit, the company agreed to an upfront commitment fee equal to 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock and a pre-funded warrant to purchase up to an additional 2,500,000. In the event the company does not retain listing status as a result of the NASDAQ hearings panel meeting on October 16, 2025, the shares will be returned to the Company.

Want to Capitalise on Green Premium Investment Opportunities?","Understanding Green Premium Fundamentals

Green premiums represent the additional financial burden that sustainable alternatives impose compared to conventional options in today's marketplace. This cost differential reflects the economic reality where environmentally responsible technologies require higher capital investments, specialised manufacturing processes, and developing supply networks that haven't achieved large-scale efficiencies.

The concept extends beyond simple price comparisons to encompass the true economic cost of environmental responsibility. Furthermore, modern markets increasingly recognise these premiums as essential components of the transition toward sustainable industrial practices, with trading platforms now establishing standardised metrics for green product classification.

Critical Characteristics of Green Premium Markets:

Price gaps between sustainable and traditional alternatives

Reflection of genuine environmental compliance costs

Significant variation across sectors and applications

Direct correlation with technology advancement stages

The London Metal Exchange's recent establishment of Commodity Pricing and Analysis Ltd in Dubai demonstrates institutional recognition of green premiums as permanent market features. This initiative leverages responsible sourcing criteria and digital trading platform data to create standardised premium calculations, starting with nickel markets where carbon footprint thresholds below 20 metric tons per ton of metal define green classification.

Recent market activity shows substantial trading volumes in sustainable metals. In addition, digital platform Metalshub processed over $220 million worth of Class I refined nickel transactions in 2023, with 488 tons of environmentally certified nickel traded since March 2024, establishing concrete benchmarks for premium calculations.

How Are Green Premiums Calculated Across Different Industries?

Premium calculation methodologies vary significantly depending on sector-specific requirements and measurement standards. The fundamental approach compares sustainable option pricing against conventional alternatives, though implementation details differ based on industry characteristics and regulatory frameworks.

Standard Mathematical Framework:

Green Premium Percentage = (Sustainable Product Cost – Conventional Product Cost) / Conventional Product Cost × 100

Metal markets have pioneered structured approaches to premium assessment. Consequently, the LME's new pricing administrator employs expert judgment mechanisms when sufficient trading data remains unavailable, assuming green premiums always exist within sustainable metal markets.

Industry-Specific Premium Calculations:

Sector Premium Methodology Key Variables Metals Processing Carbon footprint per ton Energy source, smelting technology Transportation Fuels Lifecycle emission analysis Feedstock origin, production method Industrial Materials Sustainability certification Raw material sourcing, manufacturing process Energy Generation Grid integration costs Storage requirements, transmission infrastructure

The nickel market's carbon footprint threshold of 20 metric tons per ton provides a concrete example of quantifiable green standards. This benchmark enables precise premium calculations based on measurable environmental impacts rather than subjective sustainability claims.

Why Do Green Premiums Exist in Today's Markets?

Multiple interconnected market forces sustain green premium structures across various industries. These fundamental drivers explain persistent price differentials despite increasing environmental consciousness and technological advancement.

Technology Development Investment Requirements

Research and development costs for clean technologies impose significant upfront expenses that manufacturers must recover through premium pricing. Patent licensing fees for innovative processes add additional cost burdens, while new facility construction requires higher capital expenditures compared to conventional alternatives.

Supply Chain Constraint Factors

Limited availability of sustainable raw materials creates scarcity-driven pricing pressure. Processing infrastructure for environmentally certified products remains underdeveloped, while specialised transportation requirements for green alternatives increase logistics costs.

Production Scale Economics

Sustainable alternatives typically operate at lower production volumes than established conventional options, preventing economies of scale realisation. Higher per-unit fixed costs across smaller manufacturing operations contribute to premium persistence, while inability to leverage mass production efficiencies maintains cost differentials.

Current copper price outlook dynamics illustrate these principles clearly. Chilean producer Codelco increased its 2026 European delivery premium to $325 per ton, rising from $234 in 2025, while German producer Aurubis implemented similar increases to $315 per ton. These premium adjustments reflect supply chain redistribution challenges and compliance cost pressures.

Which Sectors Show the Highest Green Premiums?

Certain industries face particularly severe green premium challenges due to technical complexity, regulatory requirements, or fundamental production limitations. Understanding these high-premium sectors provides insight into where sustainable alternatives face the greatest economic barriers.

Critical Materials and Specialty Metals

The germanium market exemplifies extreme premium conditions where sustainable sourcing faces geopolitical constraints. Industry specialists report material shortages at any price point, with germanium prices reaching 25-year highs following Chinese export restrictions. Some manufacturers struggle to secure supplies regardless of premium willingness.

Transportation Fuel Alternatives

Sustainable aviation fuel represents one of the most challenging green premium environments, with costs reaching multiple times conventional jet fuel prices. Limited production capacity and complex certification requirements sustain these extreme differentials, while infrastructure constraints prevent rapid scaling.

Base Metal Processing

Aluminium smelting operations with verified low carbon footprints command substantial premiums as manufacturers address scope 3 emission requirements. Industry analysts project aluminium prices above $3,000 per ton, potentially reaching $4,000, compared to current levels around $2,765 per ton, driven partly by sustainable production capacity constraints.

Rare Earth Elements

China's addition of holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium to restricted export lists creates extreme premium conditions for these specialty materials. Most metal traders lack familiarity with these elements, yet they increasingly influence global market dynamics and sustainable technology development.

How Do Government Policies Influence Green Premium Levels?

Policy interventions significantly shape green premium dynamics through various mechanisms that can either amplify or reduce cost differentials between sustainable and conventional alternatives. Government actions create both direct financial impacts and indirect market incentives affecting premium structures.

Strategic Infrastructure Investment Programmes

The Australian government's commitment of A$135 million ($87.4 million) to maintain Trafigura's smelter operations demonstrates direct policy intervention in sustainable metals processing. This investment addresses critical processing capacity shortfalls while supporting domestic sustainable material production capabilities, highlighting Aussie green metals leadership in the sector.

Export Control and Trade Policy Mechanisms

China's germanium export restrictions illustrate how trade policies create artificial scarcity conditions that amplify green premiums. Beijing's expansion of restricted export lists to include additional rare earth elements directly impacts global sustainable technology supply chains and pricing structures.

Processing Capacity Strategic Priorities

Industry leaders emphasise that processing infrastructure matters more than raw material availability for sustainable supply chain security. Trade house executives argue that Western nations need base metal smelting capacity to produce critical materials and break Chinese processing dominance over exotic metals like gallium and germanium.

Carbon Pricing and Regulatory Frameworks

Direct carbon taxation increases conventional product costs

Emissions cap systems create financial advantages for clean alternatives

International border adjustment mechanisms equalise competitive conditions

Procurement mandates establish guaranteed market demand

The collapse in copper smelting fees, with spot treatment terms turning negative, prompted joint governmental responses from Japan, Spain, and South Korea expressing concerns over raw materials market sustainability.

What Role Do Green Premiums Play in Metal Markets?

Metal markets serve as laboratories for green premium development, with sophisticated trading mechanisms and precise measurement standards enabling detailed premium analysis. These markets demonstrate how sustainability requirements integrate with traditional commodity trading structures.

Copper Market Premium Dynamics

European copper premiums for 2026 deliveries show significant increases reflecting sustainability and supply chain pressures. Codelco's premium rise to $325 per ton and Aurubis's increase to $315 per ton demonstrate how tariff policies and supply redistribution create premium pressure across traditional metal markets.

The copper premium increases signal broader market transformation where tariff-driven inventory movements to the United States force other regions to pay higher premiums for supply security. This redistribution creates artificial scarcity conditions that amplify green premium effects.

Sustainable Nickel Trading Infrastructure

Digital trading platform Metalshub established concrete frameworks for green nickel transactions, processing over $220 million in Class I refined nickel during 2023. The platform's definition of green nickel as metal with carbon footprints below 20 metric tons per ton creates measurable sustainability standards.

Since March 2024, Metalshub facilitated 488 tons of certified green nickel trades, providing sufficient transaction data to support systematic premium calculations. This trading volume demonstrates market appetite for sustainable metal alternatives despite premium costs.

Aluminium Market Transformation Indicators

Aluminium market sentiment shifted dramatically toward bullish outlooks as supply dynamics change fundamentally. China's maintained smelter capacity restrictions combined with growing demand concerns create conditions where sustainable production commands increasing premiums.

Consultancy projections for aluminium prices exceeding $3,000 per ton, potentially reaching $4,000, reflect supply constraint recognition and sustainable production capacity limitations. These price projections incorporate premium expectations for environmentally certified aluminium production.

Critical Materials Supply Chain Disruption

Rare earth export controls demonstrate how geopolitical factors amplify green premiums for critical materials. China's dominance over exotic metal processing creates vulnerability points where export restrictions generate extreme premium conditions for energy transition minerals.

How Are Companies Reducing Green Premiums Through Innovation?

Organisations implement various strategies to narrow green premium gaps through technological advancement, operational efficiency improvements, and strategic collaboration arrangements. These approaches address fundamental cost drivers while maintaining environmental performance standards.

Processing Technology Optimisation

Companies develop more efficient production methods that reduce energy consumption and waste generation. Integration of renewable energy sources into manufacturing processes helps lower carbon footprints whilst potentially reducing operating costs over time. This aligns with broader sustainable mining transformation initiatives across the industry.

Strategic Partnership and Infrastructure Development

Industry collaboration through consortiums enables shared infrastructure investments that distribute premium reduction costs across multiple participants. Long-term supply agreements provide volume certainty that supports larger-scale sustainable production facilities.

Market Structure Innovation

Traditional benchmark pricing systems face challenges as smelters explore bilateral agreements and tolling contracts with miners and traders. These alternative arrangements may provide more flexible approaches to managing green premium costs whilst maintaining supply security.

Japan, Spain, and South Korea's joint statement regarding copper processing fees reflects industry recognition that current market structures may require fundamental changes to accommodate sustainable processing requirements.

Technology Breakthrough Development

Advanced catalyst technologies for cleaner processing methods

Alternative feedstock development reducing raw material constraints

Energy storage and conversion efficiency improvements

Circular economy integration reducing waste costs

The collapse in copper smelting margins, with spot treatment terms turning negative, forces structural innovation in processing arrangements. Companies explore new commercial models that better align sustainable processing costs with market pricing mechanisms.

What Are the Long-Term Projections for Green Premium Evolution?

Market forecasting indicates significant green premium reduction potential over the next decade as technologies mature and production capacity expands. However, timeline projections vary considerably across different sectors and material categories.

Copper Market Demand Surge Projections

Wood Mackenzie forecasts 24% global copper demand growth by 2035, with disruptive sectors like data centres potentially amplifying demand and price volatility beyond current expectations. This demand growth may initially sustain green premiums before production scaling reduces cost differentials.

Aluminium Supply-Demand Rebalancing Timeline

Industry analysts express growing concerns about aluminium supply adequacy for the first time in decades. China's maintained smelter capacity restrictions combined with accelerating demand create conditions where sustainable production premiums may persist longer than previously anticipated.

Critical Materials Geopolitical Evolution

Rare earth market dynamics suggest premium persistence through continued Chinese processing dominance. Where germanium experiences extreme premiums today, gallium and other critical minerals may follow similar patterns, sustaining elevated costs for sustainable technology inputs.

Market Sentiment and Investment Flow Implications

Copper markets show strong bullish sentiment with funds reallocating toward hard assets amid dysfunctional raw materials markets. Low inventory levels resulting from global redistribution to the United States support arguments for sustained premium conditions.

Projected Premium Reduction Scenarios:

Timeline Expected Premium Changes Primary Drivers 2025-2027 15-25% reduction Technology scaling, policy support 2028-2030 35-50% reduction Infrastructure development, market maturity 2031-2035 60-75% reduction Full-scale production, regulatory integration

Note: These projections represent general market expectations and may vary significantly based on technological breakthroughs, policy changes, and geopolitical developments.

How Do Green Premiums Impact Investment Decisions?

Investment professionals increasingly incorporate green premium analysis into portfolio construction and risk management processes. These premiums represent both opportunity identification mechanisms and risk assessment factors across various asset classes and sectors.

Market Psychology and Sentiment Analysis

Copper markets demonstrate strong bullish sentiment with the metal consistently topping LME seminar polls for price upside potential. Even traditionally contrarian analysts acknowledge robust long-term demand growth combined with supply challenges, indicating widespread recognition of premium sustainability.

Fund Allocation Strategy Shifts

Investment funds increasingly reallocate capital toward hard assets amid recognition of dysfunctional raw materials markets. This reallocation reflects understanding that green premiums represent structural market features rather than temporary pricing anomalies.

Risk Assessment Framework Evolution

Premium volatility affects project economic modelling

Regulatory changes rapidly alter cost structure assumptions

Technology disruption may eliminate entire premium categories

Geopolitical factors create supply chain vulnerability points

Opportunity Recognition Mechanisms

Companies successfully reducing green premiums gain competitive advantages that translate into investment performance. First-mover advantages in emerging green markets provide portfolio differentiation opportunities, while supportive policy frameworks create favourable investment environments.

Sector-Specific Investment Implications

The aluminium market's bullish sentiment reversal demonstrates how supply constraint recognition affects investment positioning. Analysts worry about supply growth adequacy for the first time in decades, creating investment opportunities in sustainable aluminium production capacity.

What Strategies Help Businesses Navigate Green Premium Challenges?

Organisations can implement comprehensive approaches to manage green premium impacts whilst advancing sustainability objectives and maintaining competitive market positioning. These strategies address both cost management and strategic advantage development.

Supply Chain Security and Diversification

Securing long-term green supply agreements provides cost predictability whilst ensuring sustainable material availability. Alternative supplier relationship development reduces dependency on single sources, while vertical integration opportunities offer direct control over sustainable production processes.

Customer Education and Market Positioning

Educating markets about the green premium helps justify costs through broader value proposition communication. Highlighting non-financial benefits of sustainable choices, including regulatory compliance and brand value enhancement, supports premium product positioning strategies.

Commercial Structure Innovation

The current benchmark pricing system faces potential transformation as smelters explore bilateral agreements and tolling contracts. These alternative commercial arrangements may provide more flexible approaches to managing sustainable processing costs whilst maintaining supply security.

Strategic Partnership Development

Technology provider collaboration for innovation access

Industry consortium participation for shared infrastructure investment

Policy maker engagement for supportive regulatory framework development

Research institution partnerships for advancement acceleration

Processing Capacity Strategic Considerations

Industry experts emphasise processing infrastructure criticality over raw material availability for supply chain security. Organisations investing in sustainable processing capabilities position themselves advantageously as geopolitical tensions affect traditional supply sources, incorporating mine reclamation innovation into their long-term strategies.

The joint governmental statement from Japan, Spain, and South Korea regarding copper processing market sustainability demonstrates how industry collaboration can influence policy responses to green premium challenges.

Future Outlook: When Will Green Premiums Disappear?

The trajectory toward green premium elimination varies dramatically across sectors and material categories. Some industries approach cost parity whilst others face persistent structural challenges requiring continued innovation and policy intervention.

Near-Term Market Dynamics (2025-2027)

Current commodity prices reflect ongoing premium pressures with copper at $5.025/lb, aluminium futures at $2,722.75/ton, and precious metals showing strong performance. Gold futures reaching $4,366.70/ozt and silver at $51.425/ozt indicate investor flight toward tangible assets amid market uncertainty.

Critical Materials Outlook Evolution

Rare earth elements represent central tension points between major economies, with germanium scarcity demonstrating current premium extremes. Five additional elements now face Chinese export restrictions: holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium, despite most traders lacking familiarity with these materials.

Sector-Specific Premium Elimination Timelines:

Renewable Energy Systems: Many regions approaching grid parity conditions

Electric Transportation: Cost competitiveness expected between 2027-2030

Sustainable Aviation Fuels: Premium persistence likely through 2035 due to certification complexity

Green Hydrogen Production: Market competitiveness projected for 2030-2035

Processing Infrastructure Development

The Western world's recognition that processing capacity matters more than raw material reserves suggests sustained investment in sustainable smelting and refining facilities. Australia's A$135 million commitment to Trafigura's operations exemplifies governmental recognition of processing infrastructure strategic importance.

Market Structure Transformation Indicators

Traditional commodity pricing mechanisms face fundamental challenges as negative copper treatment terms force structural innovation. The evolution toward bilateral agreements and tolling contracts may create more flexible premium management approaches whilst supporting sustainable processing development.

Geopolitical Factor Integration

China's continued expansion of restricted export lists affects global sustainable technology supply chains. Future premium elimination depends partly on Western nations developing alternative processing capabilities for critical materials currently dominated by Chinese production.

Investment Flow and Market Maturity

Strong bullish sentiment across copper and aluminium markets reflects recognition of structural supply constraints and demand growth. These conditions may sustain green premiums longer than technology advancement alone would suggest, particularly for materials requiring significant infrastructure investment.

The ultimate elimination of green premiums represents a critical milestone in achieving widespread sustainability adoption. Success requires coordinated efforts across technology development, policy implementation, and market transformation initiatives, with timelines varying significantly based on sector-specific challenges and advancement opportunities.

New Zealand’s action plan for aviation In September, the newly established Interim Aviation Council released an aviation action plan.
Global goal for net-zero flying The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has a goal of net-zero international aviation emissions by 2050.
States have committed to mapping out plans to cut aviation emissions and submit them to ICAO.
It appears Sustainable Aviation Aotearoa has not achieved its core purpose to “provide advice and coordination to accelerate the decarbonisation” of New Zealand’s aviation sector.","Following a brief dip during the COVID pandemic, aviation is back in a growth phase.

Globally, passenger traffic is projected to grow by 3.8% annually over the next 20 years. In New Zealand, this optimism is reflected in Jetstar’s expansion plans for its domestic and trans-Tasman services and Auckland Airport’s airfield extension.

The government has welcomed the trend and sees the aviation and tourism industries as key drivers of economic growth.

But climate impacts of flying are rarely mentioned, even though the government is currently considering whether or not to include emissions from international aviation and shipping in New Zealand’s net zero 2050 target, as recommended by the Climate Change Commission.

Emissions from New Zealand’s international aviation and shipping are equivalent to about 9% of the country’s net domestic emissions. Without action to reduce emissions from these sectors, they could grow to a third of domestic net emissions by 2050, according to the commission.

Climate Change Minister Simon Watts is expected to announce a decision next month.

New Zealand’s action plan for aviation

In September, the newly established Interim Aviation Council released an aviation action plan. It covers regulation, innovation, economic growth and emissions.

The plan’s ambition is that New Zealand will be:

reducing the use of fossil fuels and transitioning to clean energy, in line with New Zealand’s target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

In a new report, we have analysed the plan in the context of New Zealand’s international commitments.

First, let’s backtrack to 2021 and New Zealand’s first emissions reduction plan. That also included work to decarbonise aviation by setting specific targets, implementing a sustainable aviation fuel mandate and establishing a public-private leadership body.

That body, Sustainable Aviation Aotearoa (SAA), was set up in 2022. But there is no word yet on the targets or mandate. The SAA has never published any minutes, work plans, calls for evidence or advice.

Its initial balance of public and private membership became skewed in favour of industry, with more airlines and oil companies (Airbus, Boeing, Exxon Mobil, British Petroleum, Z Energy, and Channel Infrastructure) joining the group than organisations representing the environment.

Of 49 members, only three (one from the Climate Change Commission and two from the Ministry for the Environment) have an environmental focus.

New Zealand’s second emissions reduction plan, published last year, mentions aviation emissions only briefly, commenting that:

the government’s role is to facilitate industry discussions through existing forums, consider regulatory barriers and ensure New Zealand’s interests are represented on the international stage.

That statement is incorrect. The government’s role, as specified in the Climate Change Response Act, is to prepare sector-specific policies to reduce emissions. But the Climate Change Commission has reviewed these policies and found them to be inadequate – it found virtually all policy-driven goals to cut emissions were at risk of not being achieved.

Global goal for net-zero flying

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has a goal of net-zero international aviation emissions by 2050. A key task for New Zealand, one of 193 member nations, is to determine how we should implement this.

International aviation is currently a large, unregulated source of emissions. In 2024, just the first outgoing legs of flights from New Zealand emitted 3.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, equivalent to 12% of all domestic emissions from fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) combined.

States have committed to mapping out plans to cut aviation emissions and submit them to ICAO. New Zealand’s plan was already overdue in 2022. Although it appears the SAA has done some work on this, no plan has been submitted yet.

Plans from other countries, including the United Kingdom, give some idea of the challenge. They describe a mixture of low-carbon fuels, efficiency gains and offsetting – but add these won’t get us all the way.

Additional measures such as carbon removal and demand management will be required. The UK’s sustainable aviation fuel mandate began this year and will strengthen every year, with airlines facing penalties of about NZ$11 per litre for missing targets.

As the UK’s action plan notes:

Most options for aviation decarbonisation rely on new technology, the development and uptake of which is extremely uncertain, owing to the uncertain nature of technology readiness and cost of technology over time.

This is not the government’s task alone

Aviation is part of a wider system. Passengers, tourism operators, airports, airlines, fuel companies and the government all share responsibility for the sector’s requirement to cut emissions.

Failure to deliver can lead to a loss of trust and impede progress. The tourism industry is crucial for New Zealand, and it is notable that the Tourism Industry Association supports the entry of international aviation into emission targets.

It appears Sustainable Aviation Aotearoa has not achieved its core purpose to “provide advice and coordination to accelerate the decarbonisation” of New Zealand’s aviation sector.

The Interim Aviation Council may be heading the same way. It has no environmental representation and assigns no actions to the Ministry for the Environment. Nor does it mention the regulation of emissions, which is the only way to simultaneously achieve environmental goals and lower uncertainty for investors.

As the permanent council is formed, it should operate openly and balance state, industry and public interests.

AEO Secretary-General Jamal Al-Loughani told KUNA that the study examines the entire process, from sources of used cooking oil and its collection and transportation to production centers, to refining and processing steps necessary to produce high-quality, impurity-free biofuel.

According to the study, approximately 14 billion liters of used cooking oil were collected worldwide in 2022, with expectations this volume could exceed 30 billion liters by 2030. Al-Loughani also noted that global trade in used cooking oil is projected to grow from 3.7 billion gallons in 2022 to between 5 and 10 billion gallons annually by 2030, depending on efforts to stimulate its conversion into sustainable fuels.

The report details recent global advancements in producing biodiesel and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from used cooking oil. Al-Loughani highlighted projects underway in Arab countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, and pointed to growing regional interest in sustainable aviation fuels, driven by goals to reduce carbon emissions, diversify economies, and conserve natural resources.

He cited Qatar Airways’ 2023 test flight using sustainable jet fuel derived from used cooking oil imported from Finland as an example of regional momentum, with more initiatives expected as airlines pursue net-zero emission targets.

Al-Loughani emphasized that investing in converting used cooking oil into biofuel maximizes resource efficiency while serving as a strategic environmental solution to lower greenhouse gas emissions and enhance energy security. The process also supports national economies by creating new jobs.

The airline: Croatia Airlines

Route Frankfurt to Split, flight OU417

Frequency Two to four times daily

Aircraft Dash 8-Q400

Class Economy; seat 10D, aisle

Flight time 1 hour + 45 minutes (lands 18 minutes late)

Checking in

Ten years ago, when I last flew Croatia Airlines, I had an argument with a frosty check-in attendant and swore off the airline for good. A decade has passed and I had forgotten all about the experience (and the boycott) until a few days before this flight. This time, the check-in interaction is all smiles and no complaints.

Advertisement

I stay at an airport hotel inside Terminal 1 of Frankfurt Airport the night before my flight, so I don’t have far to walk to the check-in counters. The airline instructs passengers to arrive three hours before their scheduled departure, but check-in doesn’t open until two hours prior. I’m the first in line.

Baggage

Baggage allowance varies by fare class. The lowest fare class, FlyEasy, does not include checked luggage. My FlyFlexi economy ticket includes one handbag or personal item up to eight kilograms, and one checked bag up to 23 kilograms. The aforementioned argument was about excess baggage, and I’m feeling nervous when my bag is weighed. To my surprise and relief, it’s exactly 23 kilograms.

The overhead bins are too small and narrow on this Dash 8-Q400 turboprop aircraft to accommodate roller bags. Several passengers are told by the flight attendant that their cabin bags must go in the hold.

Loyalty scheme

Advertisement

Miles & More, the loyalty program shared by several Star Alliance airlines and partners. Airlines that use Miles & More as their primary frequent flyer program include Lufthansa and Swiss. Points can also be earned and redeemed on flights with participating Star Alliance airlines, including Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand.

The seat

The seats are in a 2-2 layout, 78 seats in total. I’m in aisle seat 10B. Don’t bother splurging on business class: on this plane, economy and business seats are the same width (17 inches/43 centimetres) and pitch (31 inches/79 centimetres – though the more spacious exit row seats are categorised as business). I’m short, but the legroom feels tight. A tall man sitting behind me politely asks if I’d refrain from reclining as his knees are already touching the back of my seat.

Entertainment + tech

Advertisement

Wi-Fi isn’t available on Croatia Airlines’ older, propeller-driven planes, and there are no seat-back screens or charging ports. I flick through the in-flight magazine, CROATIA. Published four times a year, it has news and guides to destinations the airline flies to, plus a selection of items for sale, including model planes and locally made jewellery.

Service

Warm, efficient and relaxed service on the ground and in the sky. Even the passengers who complain when they are separated from their cabin bags get a smile. Uniforms look professional and stylish in the classic colour combination of navy and white with a pop of red.

Food

Advertisement

On this short-haul flight, a snack of herb crackers is served, along with a choice of still or sparkling water. Food and drinks are for sale at sky-high prices: $9 for a 330ml can of Coke, $14 for a small can of Heineken beer, $9 for 40 grams of Pringles.

Sustainability

The airline is increasing its use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), expanding its fleet to include more fuel-efficient planes and focusing on better fuel management to decrease carbon emissions.*

One more thing

Advertisement

Expect to see newer planes in the fleet in the coming months and years, as the airline takes delivery of several new Airbus A220s. With visitor numbers to Croatia steadily increasing, there are plans for additional routes within Europe to be added.

The price

From €211 return from Frankfurt for economy.**

The verdict

The service is much better than what I remember from 10 years ago, but the plane is old, the seats are not comfortable and there’s no Wi-Fi.

The feasibility study will be based on NextChem waste-to-chemical segment MyRechemical SRL’s proprietary NX Circular gasification technology for converting urban and industrial waste into chemical-grade synthesis gas (syngas) that the plant would further process to produce low-carbon methanol for use in reducing emissions of hard-to-abate sectors, Maire said on Oct. 20.

The scope of the study will cover technical and economic evaluation of waste gasification as well as the subsequent purification of syngas for methanol production, according to the service provider.

If built, Maire said the plant could enable methanol production complying with FuelEU Maritime and ReFuelEU Aviation regulations, respectively, to displace fossil-based marine fuels and for use in methanol-to-jet (MtJ) production pathways aligned with emerging sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandates, helping support the broader decarbonization strategies of both the shipping and aviation industries.

Project details, integration

Confirmation of the newly awarded contract to Maire follows separate Oct. 10 announcements from Mana and NG Nordic revealing entrance into an early-stage strategic partnership with Equinor to explore potential development of the large-scale waste-to-methanol plant at Mongstad.

In addition to converting about 550,000 tpy of residual, non-circular waste into 270,000 tpy of low-carbon methanol, Mana and NG Nordic said the proposed Mongstad project would also be equipped to capture and permanently store 400,000 tpy of carbon dioxide (CO2).

The partnership’s plan for using a waste-reducing feedstock to produce green fuels together with carbon capture and storage (CCS) in a single, integrated project comes as an important step in Norway’s journey to a zero-emission society, according to Mana.

""To succeed with innovation and green transition, we must build strong alliances,"" said Jon Bergan, Mana’s chief executive officer.

""The partnership with Equinor is a milestone for Mana. Together, we are taking a new step to support the development of a circular economy and industrial decarbonization in Norway,"" Bergan added.

While a precise timeline for anticipated startup of the proposed plant has yet to be revealed, Mana and ND Nordic confirmed the project’s feasibility study is targeted for completion during spring 2026.

FlyORO Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Yeo said the modular design of the AlphaLite system allows greater flexibility, transparency, and scalability for fuel blending.","Wagner Sustainable Fuels has begun operations at Australia’s first dedicated sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blending terminal, developed in partnership with Boeing and technology company FlyORO. The facility, located at Wellcamp Airport in Toowoomba, Queensland, marks a significant milestone for the country’s aviation decarbonisation efforts.

The terminal is the world’s first co-located airport SAF blending facility and the first to operate under Australia’s Roundtable of Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) certification. Powered by FlyORO’s modular AlphaLite technology, it provides on-demand fuel blending and can be scaled or replicated at other airports across Australia and the Asia-Pacific.

Wagner Sustainable Fuels Chief Executive Officer Matt Doyle said the new facility forms part of the company’s broader strategy to reduce emissions in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and heavy transport. He noted that flexible, efficient blending solutions are essential to meet future decarbonisation goals and help the aviation sector transition toward renewable fuels.

SAF is produced from renewable or non-fossil feedstocks, including municipal solid waste, animal fats, vegetable oils, and agricultural residues. When blended with conventional jet fuel, SAF can deliver up to 80% lifecycle carbon emissions savings compared with fossil-based fuels. The current certification permits airlines to use blends of up to 50% SAF, with higher levels possible as new production pathways are approved.

According to the Boeing–CSIRO SAF Roadmap, jet fuel demand in Australia could rise by 75% by 2050, underscoring the need for scalable SAF infrastructure. Boeing’s regional partnerships aim to integrate SAF into commercial, general aviation, and defence operations. Dr. Kimberly Carnahan, Boeing Asia-Pacific sustainability director, said the company is focused on supporting local SAF production and commercialisation to help meet the aviation sector’s net-zero targets.

FlyORO Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Yeo said the modular design of the AlphaLite system allows greater flexibility, transparency, and scalability for fuel blending. The company plans to replicate the model at other airports and develop standalone facilities similar to those in Singapore.

What began as a strategy for connectivity has evolved into a foundation for diversification, technology and sustainable growth.

A sector that doubled its economic reach

The white paper shows just how dramatically aviation’s contribution has expanded in under a decade. Between 2016 and 2023, nearly every indicator of economic impact increased by double digits, and in most cases, by triple.

These figures reveal a remarkable story of economic elasticity as aviation has nearly doubled its contribution to GDP while maintaining a lean workforce. Direct employment in the sector rose by less than 5%, even as total value creation grew by more than 90%.

This means the industry is producing far greater value per employee, thanks to the region’s rapid adoption of automation, digitalisation and infrastructure efficiency. Maintenance, repair, cargo and airport operations now function as advanced industrial ecosystems, rather than labour-heavy services.

Equally striking is the scale of the indirect and induced impact, the economic ripple effect through tourism, trade, retail and logistics. These broader effects surged by 136%, showing that every new flight and every airport expansion is fuelling wider sectors of the economy.

According to the white paper, every $1 generated directly by aviation now produces $3.60 in the wider economy. That multiplier effect underscores aviation’s role not merely as a transport system but as a macroeconomic catalyst, stimulating industries far beyond its immediate reach.

National strategies and varied pathways

While the regional trend is clear, the national stories behind it vary in scale and focus. The UAE remains the benchmark, with aviation contributing 18.2% of national GDP, the highest proportion anywhere in the world. Emirates and Etihad have become global brands synonymous with connectivity and service, supporting more than 770,000 jobs and generating around $47 billion in economic output. Dubai International Airport alone is estimated to contribute roughly a quarter of Dubai’s GDP, a rare case where a single industry defines an entire city’s economy.

In Saudi Arabia, aviation is at the heart of Vision 2030. Backed by $100 billion in aviation investment and $800 billion in tourism infrastructure, the kingdom plans to handle 330 million passengers annually, reach 250 destinations, and move 4.5 million tonnes of cargo. Aviation already supports 8.6% of Saudi GDP, illustrating its growing weight in the non-oil economy and its potential to create hundreds of thousands of new skilled jobs.

Qatar has taken a more targeted approach, using aviation to project influence and facilitate re-export logistics. The sector contributes roughly 11% of GDP, led by Qatar Airways and Hamad International Airport’s efficiency-driven model. The country expects re-export activity alone to reach QAR 25 billion by 2030, cementing aviation’s role as a trade multiplier.

Further west, Egypt provides perhaps the most vivid example of aviation’s catalytic power. Since 2016, aviation’s GDP impact there has increased by 266%, driven largely by tourism and airport modernisation. The expansion of international routes has spurred rapid growth in hospitality, real estate and local transport, sectors that depend heavily on air connectivity.

Across the region, one common thread emerges: aviation is being used as industrial policy. It is a deliberate, government-backed instrument for diversification and development, rather than simply a mode of transport.

A region outperforming the world

Globally, aviation contributes around 3.5% of total GDP. The Middle East’s 4.3% share puts it nearly a quarter above the world average, a remarkable feat for a region that, just a few decades ago, had limited air transport infrastructure.

The region’s geographic advantage remains its natural strength: within an eight-hour flight of 80% of the world’s population, it has become the primary bridge between Europe, Africa and Asia. More than half of all long-haul passengers now transit through Gulf airports, making the Middle East the nexus of global aviation flow.

Dubai, Doha and Abu Dhabi have effectively become city-economies built on air connectivity, transforming location into long-term economic leverage. Unlike mature Western markets, where aviation’s share of GDP has plateaued, the Middle East’s growth remains exponential. Youthful populations, strong investment appetite and cohesive government strategy all combine to maintain momentum.

Technology, tourism and sustainability

The reasons behind this growth are as strategic as they are structural. The region’s central geography is the starting point, but it is the policy choices that have turned potential into dominance.

Governments have embedded aviation at the heart of their national visions. Saudi Vision 2030, the UAE Tourism Strategy 2031, Qatar Vision 2030 and Egypt Vision 2030 all treat the sector as a platform for diversification and employment. Collectively, these initiatives represent hundreds of billions of dollars in investment in airports, fleets and manufacturing zones.

Tourism integration is another powerful driver. About 59% of all visitors to the Middle East arrive by air, the highest ratio globally. Flagship projects, from NEOM and the Red Sea in Saudi Arabia to Dubai’s perpetual reinvention as a global tourism magnet, depend entirely on aviation as their circulatory system.

Technological transformation is also reshaping the industry’s economics. The region is adopting AI-driven maintenance systems, digital twins and data-led operations, improving efficiency and reducing emissions. The maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) market is forecast to reach $12.8 billion by 2030, driven by new facilities from Emirates Engineering, Saudia Technic and GE Aerospace’s regional bases.

Perhaps most significantly, the Middle East is emerging as a leader in sustainable aviation. Projects such as Saudi APSCO’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) initiative and the UAE’s SAF Roadmap demonstrate a determination to move from consumer to producer in the green aviation economy. For a region often defined by hydrocarbons, this pivot signals a profound strategic shift.

Outlook to 2043

Looking forward, the white paper forecasts aviation’s contribution to the regional economy to soar from $290 billion to $730 billion by 2043, an increase of 151%. The number of jobs supported by the sector is expected to more than double to over eight million, reflecting the depth of its supply chains in tourism, logistics and advanced manufacturing.

The region’s share of global aviation GDP will rise from 7.6% to 8.6%, while its portion of global aviation employment will approach 7%. Passenger volumes are projected to exceed 530 million per year, driven by network expansion, tourism diversification and new carriers like Riyadh Air.

This is not merely growth, it is transformation. Aviation is becoming the industrial base of the future Middle Eastern economy, uniting logistics, technology, and sustainability. Airports are evolving into self-contained economic zones, while national carriers are turning into engines of export and employment.

One of the most telling insights from the report is that aviation contributes a greater share of GDP to the UAE (18.2%) than oil does to the entire economy of the United States. Few facts illustrate more vividly how profoundly the region’s economic centre of gravity has shifted from below the ground to the skies above it.

As governments continue to invest in sustainability, technology and workforce development, aviation is set to define a new era of prosperity, one powered not by hydrocarbons, but by human mobility and global reach.

A new economic horizon

The findings of Lifting Economies confirm what the industry has long sensed: aviation is no longer a supporting market in the Middle East’s economic story but the main character. With 4.3% of GDP and 5% of employment tied to the sector, the region leads the world in aviation dependence and benefit alike.

Each terminal expansion, fleet order and training centre feeds into a wider ambition, to use connectivity as a national growth strategy. The success of this model lies in the region’s ability to treat aviation not just as infrastructure but as a driver of trade, technology, and diversification.

As the region’s runways continue to expand, so too does its economic altitude. The whitepaper reinforces with data the idea that the future wealth of the Middle East will not just be mined or built, but it will be flown.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/10/17/FAPF9733-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 13:16:41.359584

Dans ce domaine, l'Union européenne joue un rôle clé. Conformément au Traité sur le fonctionnement de l'Union européenne (TFUE), l'UE partage avec les États membres la compétence en matière de transports. En d'autres termes, elle intervient lorsque les enjeux dépassent le cadre national et nécessitent une approche commune.

La politique européenne des transports a d'abord visé à construire le marché intérieur, en facilitant la libre circulation des biens et des personnes à travers les frontières. Mais ses objectifs se sont progressivement élargis : la protection de l'environnement est désormais au cœur des décisions européennes. Grâce à ses stratégies de mobilité durable et à ses mesures de réduction des émissions de gaz à effet de serre, l'Union agit pour rendre les transports plus verts, notamment dans le domaine de l'aviation.

C'est dans ce contexte qu'a été adopté en 2023 le règlement RefuelEU Aviation, qui impose progressivement aux compagnies aériennes d'incorporer des carburants durables. Depuis le 1ᵉʳ janvier 2025, ce règlement demande aux fournisseurs d’intégrer au minimum 2 % de SAF dans le carburant mis à disposition des aéroports européens.

La proportion de SAF devra ensuite augmenter progressivement pour atteindre 6 % en 2030, puis 70 % en 2050. À partir de 2030, une part croissante de e-kérosène sera également imposée : 1,2 % en 2030, puis 35 % à l’horizon 2050. L'objectif global est clair : réduire les émissions nettes du secteur aérien de 55 % d’ici 2030, et de 65 à 70 % d’ici 2050, par rapport à un scénario où aucune mesure ne serait prise.

Des carburants alternatifs vraiment verts ?

Les carburants d'aviation durable, ou SAF (""sustainable aviation fuel""), sont conçus pour remplacer le kérosène classique dans les avions sans modification technique. Ils peuvent être directement mélangés au carburant fossile, jusqu’à hauteur de 50 %, et utilisés dans les moteurs actuels.

Deux grandes voies de production existent aujourd’hui. La première, déjà utilisée, consiste à fabriquer des biocarburants à partir de résidus agricoles (colza, tournesol, betteraves, canne à sucre), d'huiles de cuisson ou de graisses animales. La seconde, encore marginale, repose sur le e-kérosène, produit grâce à de l'électricité renouvelable et du dioxyde de carbone capté. Ce dernier apparaît comme le plus prometteur, à condition d'utiliser exclusivement de l'électricité d’origine renouvelable pour sa fabrication. Mais il reste pour l'heure trop coûteux et encore loin d'une production industrielle.

Selon une étude de Transport & Environment (T&E) parue en janvier 2024, 45 projets de production d’e-kérosène ont été recensés dans l'Espace économique européen (EEE). Dans le détail, l'organisation a dénombré 25 projets industriels et 20 projets pilotes plus modestes dédiés à la production d’e-kérosène pour l’aviation. Les 25 projets industriels recensés visent à produire 1,7 million de tonnes de ce carburant d’ici 2030, soit bien plus que les 600 000 tonnes exigées par la réglementation européenne ReFuelEU. Une telle production permettrait d’alimenter environ 70 000 vols Paris–New York et d’éviter 4,6 millions de tonnes de CO₂. Mais pour l'heure, aucun projet n'a encore franchi l'étape décisive de l'investissement et du lancement des travaux.

L'organisation européenne pour la sécurité de la navigation aérienne (Eurocontrol) estime également que les SAF constituent une réelle opportunité pour l'avenir. Elle affirme que ces carburants permettent de réduire jusqu’à 80 % les émissions de CO₂ par rapport au kérosène fossile. Dans les faits, leur impact dépend fortement de leur origine, de leur mode de fabrication et des ressources utilisées. Les biocarburants issus d'huiles usagées sont parmi les plus vertueux, tandis que ceux produits à partir de cultures comme le maïs ou l’huile de palme soulèvent des inquiétudes environnementales.

Des objectifs encore lointains, une Union ambitieuse

Si l'UE entend réduire les émissions nettes du secteur aérien de 55 % d’ici 2030, l'écart entre l'ambition affichée et la réalité reste considérable. En 2024, la production mondiale de SAF ne représentait que 0,53 % de la consommation de carburants d'aviation, contre 0,2 % en 2023 selon l’Agence européenne de la sécurité aérienne (AESA).

Pour atteindre l’objectif de 2030, il faudrait que la production actuelle soit multipliée par dix en seulement cinq ans. Selon certains spécialistes de la transition énergétique, la montée en puissance de la production de SAF est lente notamment à cause des tensions sur les ressources énergétiques. Concrètement, la production entre en concurrence avec d'autres besoins, tels que la demande pour l’électricité et les carburants pour les véhicules électriques, ce qui limite les capacités à se concentrer uniquement sur l'aviation.

Malgré ces difficultés, le projet européen se distingue par son caractère pionnier : à ce jour, aucune autre région du monde n’impose au secteur des quotas de carburants durables aussi exigeants.

Une équation économique difficile à résoudre

Le coût et la disponibilité du SAF sont au cœur des préoccupations des compagnies aériennes. D'après des données publiées par l'Association internationale du transport aérien (IATA), le SAF coûte entre deux à cinq fois plus cher que le kérosène fossile. Une différence de prix que les transporteurs ne peuvent absorber seuls, surtout dans un secteur très concurrentiel aux marges souvent réduites. Beaucoup de compagnies redoutent une hausse inévitable du prix des billets, qui pourrait être directement répercutée sur les voyageurs.

Selon les analyses de l'ONG Transport and Environment, les compagnies aériennes européennes affichent des écarts importants concernant l'intégration des SAF dans leur modèle de développement. Certaines, comme Air France – KLM, British Airways (International Airlines Group) ou la compagnie nationale allemande Lufthansa, sont en avance en passant régulièrement des commandes de SAF et en établissant des partenariats durables avec les producteurs. Air France est même le leader mondial selon le classement établi. À l'inverse, des compagnies telles que Ryanair ou Wizz Air misent d’abord sur l’acquisition d’avions plus économes en carburant fossile, tout en amorçant progressivement des efforts dans l'approvisionnement en carburants durables, témoignant ainsi d'une démarche plus graduelle vers la décarbonation.

Même pour les compagnies les plus volontaristes, un obstacle majeur demeure : la structure même du marché. Les compagnies aériennes fonctionnent généralement avec des contrats d’approvisionnement d'une durée limitée, souvent annuelle. Dans un marché encore naissant, il leur paraît risqué de s’engager sur plusieurs années avec un fournisseur peu connu, à un prix fixe, alors que la concurrence pourrait contribuer à réduire les coûts dans quelques années. Cette incertitude explique pourquoi certaines préfèrent temporiser avant de s'engager réellement.

Le 16 juillet 2025, le chef de l'Association du transport aérien international (IATA) a appelé l'UE à ""réévaluer"" ses objectifs de décarbonation dans le secteur aérien. ""Je pense que l'UE en particulier doit réévaluer les objectifs qu'elle a définis"", a déclaré Willie Walsh.

Selon lui, l’UE aurait d'abord dû évaluer la production actuelle et future de carburant vert avant de fixer ""un objectif pertinent par rapport à la production"". Certaines compagnies aériennes d'Europe achètent du carburant durable en dehors de l’UE pour se conformer aux seuils fixés. Une situation qu'il juge peu sensée en raison de l’empreinte carbone générée par le transport du carburant.

Contribuant à près de 3 % des émissions mondiales de dioxyde de carbone, le secteur de l'aviation est parmi les plus difficiles à décarboner.

Les mesures européennes ReFuelEU Aviation imposent des quotas de SAF dès 2025 à tous les opérateurs d’aéronefs qui effectuent des vols commerciaux au départ des aéroports situés dans l’Union européenne, indépendamment de leur nationalité. Ainsi, les compagnies aériennes non européennes sont également tenues de respecter ces quotas lorsqu’elles opèrent des vols depuis l’UE. La réglementation vise précisément à garantir l’équité en imposant un cadre harmonisé à l’ensemble des acteurs du secteur aérien opérant dans l’Union. Elle entend ainsi éviter tout risque de distorsion concurrentielle et limiter les pratiques telles que le ""tankering"" (chargement excessif de carburant hors UE pour échapper aux règles locales).

Mais la responsabilité de la transition ne repose pas uniquement sur les compagnies. Les fournisseurs de carburants sont eux aussi tenus d’incorporer un pourcentage croissant de SAF dans leur production à partir de 2025. Des mécanismes de contrôle existent et des sanctions peuvent être appliquées en cas de non-respect. Ainsi, l'analyse ne se limite pas à la demande : l'offre joue également un rôle central dans la dynamique du marché.

Une pièce centrale mais insuffisante du défi climatique

Pour la Commission européenne, les carburants d'aviation durable constituent aujourd'hui la solution la plus avancée et immédiatement disponible pour réduire les émissions, notamment sur les vols moyen et long-courriers où l’électrique et l’hydrogène ne sont pas encore viables à grande échelle. Mais ils ne suffiront pas à décarboner complètement le secteur, d'autant que la croissance attendue du trafic risque d’effacer une partie des progrès accomplis.

C'est pourquoi de nombreux experts – à l'image du scénario ""Destination 2050"" élaboré par les acteurs du secteur – insistent sur la nécessité d'activer d’autres leviers : améliorer l'efficacité énergétique des avions, instaurer une fiscalité plus équitable des carburants, renforcer le recours au train à grande vitesse ou encore limiter les trajets les plus polluants, comme les courts-courriers et les jets privés.

La décarbonation de l’aviation européenne reposera donc à la fois sur des innovations technologiques, des investissements massifs et des choix collectifs dans nos modes de transport. Les carburants durables en sont une pièce maîtresse, mais certainement pas l'unique solution.",https://www.touteleurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Aviation-durable.png,N,,2025-10-20 17:00:24.000521

These discarded materials, ranging from used cooking oil to municipal solid waste, are rapidly emerging as a new frontier in the global pursuit of renewable fuel production. Driven by stringent environmental mandates, the compelling economics of waste valorization, and a strategic pivot towards sustainable investments, London investors are pouring significant capital into this nascent sector, signaling a profound shift in the renewable energy landscape with far-reaching implications.

This surge in investment is not merely a fleeting trend but a calculated response to the urgent need for decarbonization and enhanced energy security. By transforming waste into valuable biofuels, the industry addresses critical environmental challenges, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and alleviating landfill pressures, while simultaneously unlocking substantial economic opportunities. The immediate consequence of this concentrated financial backing is an accelerated pace of innovation, the rapid scaling of waste-to-fuel technologies, and the solidification of a circular economy model where waste is no longer a liability but a strategic asset in the energy transition.

The Rise of Waste as a Commodity: A Detailed Look at London's Green Bet

The burgeoning interest from London investors in waste-based biofeedstocks marks a pivotal moment in the renewable energy sector. This isn't just about sustainability; it's about smart economics meeting pressing environmental needs. The core of this movement lies in the ability to convert diverse organic wastes—such as used cooking oil (UCO), animal fats, agricultural residues, municipal solid waste (MSW), and even wastewater sludge—into advanced biofuels like renewable diesel, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and biogas. These fuels offer a significantly lower carbon footprint than their fossil counterparts, with some pathways even achieving negative emissions through efficient waste management.

The timeline leading up to this moment has been shaped by evolving global energy policies and a growing awareness of climate change. Over the past decade, international agreements like the Paris Agreement, coupled with national mandates such as the UK's Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO), have created a robust regulatory framework incentivizing renewable fuel production. The RTFO, for instance, sets ambitious targets for fuel suppliers to incorporate increasing percentages of renewable fuel, aiming for nearly 19.5% by 2030. This policy certainty, combined with the increasing financial pressure on companies to meet Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria, has made waste-based biofuels particularly attractive. The period between 2020 and 2025 has seen a notable acceleration in investment, as technological advancements in processes like anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis, gasification, and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) have made waste-to-fuel conversion more efficient and scalable.

Key players and stakeholders involved in this emerging market include specialized waste management and bioenergy companies, major oil and gas firms diversifying their portfolios, and, crucially, a growing cohort of private equity and institutional investors based in London. Companies like Alkagesta, for instance, are at the forefront, combining trade execution, risk management, and investment structuring to transform UCO and other biofeedstocks into traceable and compliant commodities. Large energy companies such as BP (LSE: BP) and Shell (LSE: SHEL) are also actively investing in advanced biofuels, recognizing the strategic importance of diversifying their energy mix. Initial market reactions have been overwhelmingly positive, with increased valuations for companies demonstrating viable waste-to-fuel technologies and a heightened interest in green bonds and sustainable finance instruments directed towards this sector. The market perceives waste-based biofeedstocks as a more resilient and less volatile commodity compared to traditional agricultural feedstocks, which can be subject to food-versus-fuel debates and price fluctuations due to crop yields.

The immediate implications are clear: a rapid expansion of waste collection and processing infrastructure, a surge in research and development for new conversion technologies, and the creation of new localized supply chains. This trend reinforces the shift towards a circular economy, where waste is viewed not as a disposal problem but as a valuable resource, impacting everything from urban waste management practices to industrial production cycles. The integration of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology with Energy-from-Waste (EfW) facilities is further boosting investor confidence, positioning the UK as a leader in carbon reduction and creating new green jobs, thereby accelerating the push towards negative emissions targets.

Corporate Fortunes Shift: Winners and Losers in the Biofeedstock Boom

The escalating investment in waste-based biofeedstocks is poised to redraw the competitive landscape across several industries, creating significant opportunities for agile companies while posing substantial challenges for those slow to adapt. This paradigm shift, driven by environmental imperatives and economic incentives, will profoundly impact the operations, market positions, and financial performance of public and private entities alike.

Companies Poised to Win

The most significant beneficiaries are renewable fuel producers specializing in waste feedstocks, along with forward-thinking waste management companies and traditional energy majors diversifying their portfolios.

Renewable Fuel Producers: Companies like Neste (XHEL: NESTE, OTC: NTOIY) are leading the charge. As the world's largest producer of renewable diesel and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), Neste's reliance on waste materials like used cooking oil and animal fats for over 95% of its feedstock by 2025 positions it for massive growth. Its proprietary NEXBTL technology ensures low carbon intensity, maximizing value in credit markets. Darling Ingredients (NYSE: DAR), through its 50/50 joint venture with Valero, Diamond Green Diesel (DGD), leverages its global organic waste processing capabilities to create one of the world's largest renewable diesel operations, benefiting from a vertically integrated, low-cost feedstock supply. Aemetis (NASDAQ: AMTX) is expanding its dairy digester network for negative-carbon-intensity Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) and developing a large SAF and renewable diesel plant using waste wood and carbon capture. Gevo (NASDAQ: GEVO), while also using renewable carbohydrates, is a key player in SAF and operates significant dairy-based RNG facilities, enhancing profitability through high-value co-products.

Waste Management Companies: Traditional waste management giants are increasingly integrating into biofuel production. Waste Management (NYSE: WM), for example, is heavily investing in RNG infrastructure, capturing landfill gas to fuel its own fleet and supply others. This strategic move transforms a liability (landfill gas emissions) into a valuable, revenue-generating asset, strengthening its market position in sustainable waste solutions.

RNG Specialists: Pure-play Renewable Natural Gas companies are also set for significant expansion. Clean Energy Fuels Corp (NASDAQ: CLNE), the largest provider of RNG in the U.S., benefits from its extensive network and strategic partnerships with major energy players. Montauk Renewables (NASDAQ: MNTK), which converts landfill and agricultural waste into pipeline-quality RNG, is well-positioned to capitalize on increasing demand for low-carbon gas. OPAL Fuels (NASDAQ: OPAL) specializes in converting biogas from landfills and dairies into RNG for heavy- and medium-duty trucking fleets, expanding its capacity through joint ventures.

Oil and Gas Majors Diversifying: Even traditional energy giants are making substantial pivots. BP (NYSE: BP) acquired Archaea Energy for $4.1 billion to significantly boost its RNG output and invested in WasteFuel for bio-methanol production from waste. TotalEnergies (NYSE: TTE) has invested in Clean Energy Fuels' RNG business, while Chevron (NYSE: CVX) expanded its biofuels through the acquisition of Renewable Energy Group and a joint venture with Brightmark. Repsol, a Spanish energy company, is pioneering large-scale production of 100% renewable fuels from organic waste at its Cartagena complex, aligning with its net-zero ambitions. These companies are enhancing their market positions by diversifying their energy portfolios and hedging against future fossil fuel demand decline.

Companies Facing Challenges

Conversely, businesses that remain heavily invested in traditional fossil fuels without significant biofuel diversification, or those in waste management slow to adopt advanced conversion technologies, may face headwinds.

Traditional Fossil Fuel Producers (without diversification): Companies solely focused on crude oil and natural gas extraction and refining, without substantial investments in renewable fuels, risk long-term erosion of demand. As sectors like aviation and heavy transport increasingly mandate biofuels, these firms could see shrinking market shares and reduced profitability due to shifting demand and rising regulatory costs associated with carbon emissions.

Waste-to-Energy (WtE) Incineration Plants (without diversification): While WtE incineration plants reduce landfill volume and generate electricity, they often have high capital and operational costs and may offer lower energy conversion efficiencies compared to advanced biofuel production. If the market prioritizes waste conversion into higher-value transportation fuels over electricity generation, these facilities might struggle to compete and miss out on lucrative environmental credit markets.

Companies Reliant on Food-Based Biofuels: The persistent ""food vs. fuel"" debate and increasing governmental reluctance to support biofuels derived from food crops (e.g., corn, soy) pose a threat. Companies dependent on these feedstocks may face regulatory hurdles, reduced subsidies, and public scrutiny as waste-based alternatives gain preference, potentially impacting their market position and financial viability.

In essence, the biofeedstock boom is accelerating a fundamental transformation. Companies embracing waste as a resource are poised for operational efficiencies, market expansion, and robust financial growth, fueled by both product sales and environmental credits. Those resistant to this shift, however, risk obsolescence in an increasingly decarbonized and circular global economy.

Broader Implications: A Catalyst for Circularity and Decarbonization

The pronounced backing of waste-based biofeedstocks by London's financial sector is far more than a localized investment trend; it represents a significant accelerant for global decarbonization efforts and a fundamental shift towards a circular economy. This influx of capital into waste valorization is redefining how industries perceive and manage waste, transforming it from a liability into a critical resource for a sustainable future.

Fitting into Broader Industry Trends

This investment wave is a cornerstone of the burgeoning circular economy. By converting organic waste into valuable fuels, the process drastically reduces landfill dependence, conserves natural resources, and mitigates environmental pollution. It champions the principle of ""waste-to-wealth,"" where discarded materials re-enter the economic cycle as high-value products. London-based firms like Alkagesta are instrumental in this, structuring investments that turn biofeedstocks such as Used Cooking Oil (UCO) into investable, traceable commodities, thereby facilitating this global circular transition.

Furthermore, it is a crucial pillar of global decarbonization strategies, particularly for ""hard-to-abate"" sectors like aviation, heavy transport, and marine industries, where electrification remains challenging. Waste-based biofuels offer substantial reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions—up to 90% for Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) from UCO compared to fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts a more than 20% increase in global demand for advanced biofuels by 2030, with waste-derived fuels driving the majority of this expansion. Major oil and gas companies are strategically increasing their investments in this sector to meet their own decarbonization targets and respond to the growing demand for sustainable fuel sources.

Ripple Effects on Competitors and Partners

The intensified focus on waste-based biofeedstocks will create significant ripple effects. Competitors in the advanced biofuels sector will likely face increased pressure to innovate and improve efficiency, potentially leading to a more competitive market for technologies and feedstock sourcing. This could also spur the development of new global trade routes specifically for waste streams, making materials like UCO a highly prized commodity. Domestically, certain first-generation bioethanol industries, often reliant on food crops, might face challenges from cheaper, more environmentally favorable waste-derived imports.

Partners across the supply chain, from waste generators (e.g., restaurants, food manufacturers) to waste collection, sorting, and processing companies, will see increased demand for their services. This fosters greater integration into vertically aligned business models within the renewable fuel supply chain. However, it also introduces potential challenges such as supply chain disruptions and increased operating costs for biofuel producers due to feedstock scarcity and price volatility, necessitating robust long-term sourcing strategies.

Regulatory and Policy Implications

Regulatory frameworks are not just influencing but actively driving this investment. In the United Kingdom, the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) mandates increasing proportions of low-carbon biofuels, with waste-derived feedstocks receiving ""double credits,"" providing a powerful economic incentive. The upcoming UK Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) obligation, supported by revenue-certainty mechanisms, is projected to add billions to the economy and create thousands of jobs. The European Union's Renewable Energy Directive (RED II and RED III) explicitly favors waste and residue feedstocks, setting blending targets and restricting food crop-based biofuels. Upcoming regulations like ""ReFuel EU Aviation"" and ""FuelEU Maritime,"" commencing in 2025, will further differentiate feedstock categories and mandate increased biofuel use in these critical sectors. Globally, government policies, including blending mandates and tax credits (e.g., the U.S. Clean Fuel Production Credit), are crucial for driving investment, though policy volatility remains a risk factor.

Historical Precedents and Comparisons

The current trend echoes past shifts in energy and infrastructure. The consistent outperformance of renewable power investments over fossil fuels in the last decade, often with lower volatility, provides a historical precedent for the financial viability of green energy solutions. There has been a clear shift from food-based to waste-based biofuels, learning from the ""food vs. fuel"" debate and indirect land-use change concerns associated with first-generation biofuels. This has paved the way for second-generation, waste-derived biofuels as more sustainable. Furthermore, the viewing of waste management companies, especially those involved in waste-to-energy conversion, as vital infrastructure assets mirrors how renewable energy was initially recognized as an investable infrastructure class. Early innovators like London-based Bio-bean, converting waste coffee grounds into biodiesel since 2014, demonstrated the feasibility of pure waste streams for biofuel production, setting the stage for today's expansive investment. These historical lessons underscore the structural, long-term nature of this transition.

The Road Ahead: Navigating the New Commodity Frontier

The trajectory for waste-based biofeedstocks is set for dynamic growth, driven by an urgent global imperative for decarbonization and the economic logic of the circular economy. London's strategic investments are not merely reacting to current trends but are actively shaping the future of sustainable energy and waste management.

Short-Term and Long-Term Possibilities

In the short term (1-5 years), we anticipate an accelerated adoption of waste-derived inputs like used cooking oil (UCO) and animal fats, particularly for Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Global biofuel demand is projected to increase by nearly 30% by 2028, with waste and residues accounting for a growing share. The expansion of efficient Waste-to-Energy (WtE) facilities, driven by population growth and increased solid waste generation, will continue, with the market expected to grow by 6.3% annually to reach around $78.3 billion by 2032. Focus will remain on high-priority organic waste streams like agricultural residues, municipal solid waste (MSW), and food waste, with the waste-derived biogas market alone projected to reach $126.2 billion by 2030. Continuous technological advancements in gasification, pyrolysis, and anaerobic digestion will improve efficiency and expand the range of treatable waste types.

In the long term (beyond 5 years), waste-based biofeedstocks are poised to become a cornerstone of the global energy transition. By 2050, waste-based biofuels could supply an additional 20 million barrels per day of liquid biofuel, potentially satisfying a quarter of all future liquid fuel demand. This will involve the development of advanced biorefineries capable of converting solid wastes into liquid fuels through sophisticated pre-treatment and thermal cracking processes, yielding biofuel versions of crude oil-based products. Beyond fuels, there's significant potential for producing high-value biochemicals and bioproducts from waste streams, offering attractive economic opportunities. Integration with carbon capture technologies in WtE facilities will also become standard, further enhancing environmental performance and profitability.

Strategic Pivots and Adaptations

To fully harness this potential, several strategic pivots are essential. Significant infrastructure investment will be needed for processing plants, logistics hubs, and carbon-efficient trading systems to build robust supply chains. Governments must provide consistent policy and regulatory support, including carbon tax credits and stricter carbon regulations, to level the playing field with fossil fuels. Continued technological innovation and R&D are crucial to overcome challenges related to energy efficiency, high production costs, and the variability of waste streams. Supply chain optimization, favoring localized ""hub-and-spoke"" models for waste collection and initial conversion, will be key to managing transport costs. Crucially, traceability and certification will become paramount, ensuring feedstocks meet international sustainability criteria and attract ESG-focused investors. Public acceptance and education will also be vital to foster support for WtE projects.

Market Opportunities and Challenges

The market opportunities are vast, driven by the surging global demand for sustainable fuels, particularly in hard-to-electrify sectors like aviation. Waste-to-energy solutions offer an innovative answer to growing waste management challenges, simultaneously providing economic benefits through reduced disposal costs and local job creation. The diversification of energy supply through localized waste-based biofuels also enhances energy security. However, significant challenges persist. Feedstock supply limitations and variability are a major concern, as rapid growth in demand may outpace the supply of commonly used waste oils and fats, leading to price volatility. High production costs and the competitive economics of securing waste feedstocks remain barriers. Contaminants and impurities in waste streams necessitate advanced pre-treatment. Lastly, regulatory uncertainty and infrastructure gaps, particularly for cross-border traceability, pose ongoing hurdles.

Potential Scenarios and Outcomes

Several scenarios could unfold. An accelerated decarbonization scenario sees strong governmental support and R&D leading to waste-based biofeedstocks making a significant contribution to net-zero pathways, with the global bio-feedstock market potentially reaching USD 224.9 billion by 2035. Conversely, a feedstock crunch/stagnation scenario could emerge if supply limitations are not addressed, leading to increased competition, volatile prices, and a slowdown in decarbonization. A diversified biorefinery scenario envisions facilities producing a range of products—fuels, chemicals, and materials—from diverse waste streams, improving economic viability. Regionalized circular economy hubs with localized processing could become dominant, fostering local economies. Finally, a ""waste as an asset class"" scenario could see certified waste-based biofeedstocks become a distinct and attractive asset class for institutional investors, driving substantial capital flow into the sector. The ability to strategically adapt and innovate will dictate which of these futures materializes.

A Sustainable Future Takes Shape: The Lasting Impact of Waste-Based Biofeedstocks

The surge of investment from London's financial heart into waste-based biofeedstocks signifies a monumental shift, marking these once-discarded materials as a new and critical commodity frontier. This trend is not merely about generating profits; it's a strategic fusion of environmental necessity and economic opportunity, paving the way for a more sustainable and circular global economy.

One-time infusion of anzu-cel (anzutresgene autoleucel, IMA203) PRAME cell therapy in 16 patients with metastatic uveal melanoma in the ongoing Phase 1b trial continues to show strong clinical benefit with more mature data: cORR of 67%, mDOR of 11.0 months, mPFS of 8.5 months and mOS not reached at 14.3 months mFU

Anzu-cel maintains a favorable tolerability profile in metastatic uveal melanoma

Anti-tumor activity observed across metastases throughout the body, including liver lesions, and in patients who received prior treatment with TCR-based therapies

Given the promising clinical activity of anzu-cel and high PRAME prevalence in uveal melanoma, a Phase 2 cohort has been initiated in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma

Houston , Texas and Tuebingen, Germany, October 20, 2025 – Immatics N.V. (NASDAQ: IMTX, “Immatics” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company and the global leader in precision targeting of PRAME, today announced the presentation of updated data from 16 patients with metastatic uveal melanoma treated with anzu-cel PRAME cell therapy.

The uveal melanoma data from the ongoing Phase 1b trial will be presented today at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2025 during the Presidential Symposium III by Sapna Patel, M.D., Professor of Medicine, University of Colorado Cancer Center. The slides are accessible in the ‘ Events & Presentations ’ section of the Investors & Media section of the Company’s website.

“Patients with metastatic uveal melanoma face a poor prognosis and represent a population in need of better outcomes, given the limited options currently available,” said Sapna Patel, M.D. “I believe the results with anzu-cel presented today signal a much-needed breakthrough for patients with metastatic uveal melanoma. These findings highlight the potential of anzu-cel to redefine the treatment paradigm for uveal melanoma and bring new hope to patients who urgently need more effective options.”

“Our goal is to leverage every opportunity to bring innovative PRAME therapies to patients with limited treatment options,” said Cedrik Britten, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Immatics. “The continued strong clinical data presented today reinforce our conviction in maximizing the potential of our PRAME cell therapy, anzu-cel, and expanding its development into metastatic uveal melanoma, a rare cancer with very high unmet medical need. We are excited to further execute on our PRAME franchise and bring meaningful progress to patients in need.”

Presidential Symposium III Presentation Summary – Anzu-cel Phase 1b Trial

Patient Population: D ifficult-to-treat patient population with metastatic uveal melanoma

As of September 24, 2025, 16 patients with metastatic uveal melanoma were administered a one-time infusion of anzu-cel at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D, 1 to 10 billion total TCR T cells) as part of the anzu-cel Phase 1b dose expansion. Patients received a median infused TCR T-cell dose of ~4 billion (range 1.62 - 8.43 billion TCR T cells) and had a median of 2 lines of prior systemic treatments. Patients had a median target lesion sum of a diameter of 103 mm (ranging from 31 to 210 mm), and 81% of patients had liver and extrahepatic metastasis.

Anti-tumor Activity and Durability: Continued strong anti-tumor activity and durability of anzu-cel PRAME cell therapy

Updated data of a one-time infusion of anzu-cel PRAME cell therapy demonstrated promising benefit in a difficult-to-treat population with limited effective treatment options:

Confirmed objective response rate (cORR) of 67% (10/15 1 )

Disease control rate (DCR) of 88% (14/16)

Median duration of response (mDOR) of 11 months (min 4.4, max 31.6 months)

Median progression-free survival (mPFS) of 8.5 months (min 1.4, max 32.9) at a mFU of 10.4 months. The PFS rate was 69% at six months and 39% at 12 months

Median overall survival (mOS) not reached (min 4.3+, max 34.2+ months) at a mFU of 14.3 months. The OS rate was 71% at 12 months

Anti-tumor activity was observed in liver and extrahepatic metastases, including lung, lymph node, abdomen/peritoneum and others. 14/16 patients had target lesions in the liver and treatment with anzu-cel led to a median shrinkage in liver target lesion size of 49.6%.

Notably, 11 out of the 16 patients received a TCR bispecific (ten gp-100-targeting, one PRAME-targeting) as prior systemic treatment line, and thereof, six achieved a confirmed partial response, one a partial response and three stable disease. These results demonstrate anti-tumor activity of anzu-cel in patients who received prior TCR-based therapies.

a Patient out of study at data cut off (withdrew consent); BL, baseline; (c)PR, (confirmed) partial response; PD, progressive disease; SD, stable disease.

a Maximum change of target lesions and RECIST1.1 response at different timepoints. b Patient off study at data cutoff date (withdrew consent). 14/16 patients had liver target lesions with median best change of longest diameter of liver target lesions (range) of -49.6% (-100, 10). BOR, best overall response; cPR , (confirmed) partial response; RECIST, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors; SD, stable disease; PD, progressive disease .

Safety: Favorable tolerability in uveal melanoma, generally consistent with full anzu-cel tolerability profile

The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAs) were anticipated cytopenias associated with lymphodepletion. Expected and manageable cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was mostly Grade 1 or 2, which is consistent with the mechanism of action (Grade 1: 37.5%, Grade 2: 43.8%, Grade 3: 18.8%, Grade 4: 0%). No patients experienced long-term CRS, and most CRS was resolved by day 14. No anzu-cel-related Grade 5 events were observed.

Tolerability in the uveal melanoma subset was generally consistent with the full anzu-cel tolerability profile in the Phase 1b.

Development Path for Anzu-cel in Metastatic Uveal Melanoma

Based on the promising clinical data in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma, Immatics has initiated a Phase 2 cohort with approximately 30 uveal melanoma patients planned. The cohort is being conducted at select centers in the U.S. and Germany with deep expertise in uveal melanoma. Given the high prevalence of PRAME expression in uveal melanoma, prospective PRAME testing is no longer required for inclusion in the clinical trial.

The consistent tolerability, anti-tumor activity and pharmacokinetic profile of anzu-cel across both uveal and cutaneous melanoma provide a strong rationale for pursuing a parallel late-stage development strategy to serve both patient populations.

About PRAME

PRAME is a target expressed in more than 50 cancers. Immatics is the global leader in precision targeting of PRAME and has the broadest PRAME franchise with the most PRAME indications and modalities. The Immatics PRAME franchise currently includes three product candidates, two therapeutic modalities and a combination therapy that target PRAME: anzu-cel (IMA203) PRAME cell therapy, IMA203CD8 PRAME cell therapy (GEN2), IMA402 PRAME bispecific, anzu-cel in combination with Moderna’s PRAME cell therapy enhancer.

About Anzu-cel (IMA203) PRAME Cell Therapy

Anzu-cel (anzutresgene autoleucel; IMA203) is a PRAME-directed TCR T-cell therapy engineered to recognize an intracellular PRAME-derived peptide presented by HLA-A*02:01 on the cell surface and initiate a potent and specific anti-tumor response. Anzu-cel PRAME cell therapy is currently being evaluated in a registration-enabling randomized controlled Phase 3 trial, “SUPRAME,” in patients with unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma who have disease progression on or after treatment with at least one checkpoint inhibitor. In parallel, the Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with PRAME cancers is ongoing with a focus on uveal melanoma.

NEWTOWN, Pa., Oct. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Solana Company (NASDAQ: HSDT) released the following letter from the Executive Chairman:

We are excited to enter the next phase of our lifecycle with a strong capital base and expanded accessibility for investors.

This week will be remembered as a foundational moment for Solana Company (NASDAQ: HSDT). We have made the deliberate choice to move forward with our scheduled registration for resale of the shares purchased by investors in the recent private placement rather than delay it. Whereas some of our peers have decided to postpone it at the first sign of market volatility, we want to explain why we made this decision and why we feel it positions us for long-term success.

Transparency in Volatile Markets

Markets can be volatile, and digital asset treasury companies will continue to experience volatility with the broader macro market.

In this next phase, with the resale registration statement effective, HSDT will be one of the largest effective market cap Solana DATs and therefore a strong investible option for institutional investors looking for exposure to Solana. Since we have launched the Solana treasury, we have opened up a new menu of capital providers and capital raise opportunities. That’s why we believe it’s appropriate to reach market equilibrium now rather than postpone the inevitable. The pressure on our stock price that comes with the effectiveness of the resale registration statement will likely shake out weak hands, but we believe this will also establish a remaining foundation of committed long-term shareholders. We're delivering for our investors by registering their shares on time and leaving the choice in the hands of our investors, where it belongs. That's what good stewardship looks like.

If HSDT trades below its net asset value in the coming days or weeks, understand what that means: investors can buy one dollar of Solana for less than a dollar. HSDT is committed to doing the right thing to maximize shareholder value.

Our Conviction

This strategy demonstrates the conviction in Solana that we share with our shareholders. We plan to continue to demonstrate how HSDT can be an active accumulation vehicle that acquires more SOL per share than investors can achieve on their own. We believe we can generate 7%+ yield through sophisticated institutional-grade staking not accessible to individual investors. We also intend to leverage the capital markets to acquire additional Solana. Most importantly, we expect to deploy capital strategically during market dislocations.

This is precisely where our vehicle will differentiate itself. We believe we have the right team of leaders and advisors. When the non-believers are flushed out, HSDT can continue to accrete Solana per share. We can buy aggressively when others are fearful. We believe we can compound Solana per share holdings through disciplined capital allocation.

Looking Ahead

This week may test your conviction. However, we are confident that disciplined investors who understand our strategy will one day look back on this period as an inflection point. We’re attempting to build the Berkshire Hathaway of the Solana ecosystem – a vehicle that compounds shareholder value and trades at a premium, with a strong balance sheet, a clear strategy, and the expertise of a team that is experienced with DATs and is shareholder-aligned with meaningful ownership. Our success is intertwined with Solana's success, which is why we're committed to actively contributing to ecosystem growth.

We're playing the long game, and we're inviting you to join us. We're playing offense, not defense. Thank you for your trust and partnership.

– Joseph Chee, Executive Chairman

Qatar, Australia, Indonesia, Singapore, and Spain’s Iberia are at the forefront, implementing policies and programs to accelerate the adoption of SAF in their aviation sectors.

What Is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a biofuel derived from renewable resources such as waste oils, agricultural residues, and other biomass. SAF can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, making it a crucial component in the aviation industry’s strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

Where Are These SAF Initiatives Being Implemented?

Qatar

Qatar Airways has committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and is actively working with industry stakeholders to accelerate the adoption of SAF. In 2022, Qatar Airways signed a deal with Shell to source 3,000 metric tonnes of neat SAF at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, marking a significant step in its SAF procurement efforts. Additionally, Qatar Airways is the first carrier in the Middle East to join the International Civil Aviation Organization‘s (ICAO) Global Coalition for Sustainable Aviation, reaffirming its commitment to sustainable aviation practices.

Australia

Australia is investing in the development of a domestic SAF industry through a $30 million funding initiative announced by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) in July 2023. This initiative aims to reduce emissions in the aviation sector by supporting the production of SAF from agricultural feedstocks. The Australian government recognizes aviation as a “hard-to-abate” industry and is leveraging its bioenergy sector to unlock market opportunities for SAF production.

Indonesia

Indonesia plans to introduce a 1% SAF blend for international flights by 2026, with a gradual increase to 5% by 2035. The Indonesian Ministry of Transportation is currently drafting regulations to implement this SAF adoption timeline. This initiative aligns with Indonesia’s broader strategy to reduce carbon emissions from the aviation sector and promote the use of renewable fuels.

Singapore

Singapore is implementing a flight levy to boost the use of SAF, effective from 2026. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced that all international flights departing from Singapore will be mandated to use SAF starting in 2026. The levy aims to provide an incentive for airlines to invest in SAF production facilities and accelerate the transition to greener aviation fuels.

Spain (Iberia)

Iberia Airlines has launched the “SAF Circle” initiative, a program designed to help companies reduce the environmental impact of their air travel by supporting the use of SAF. Companies participating in the program can purchase SAF for their flights, helping them offset the carbon footprint of their business travel. The SAF used in the program is produced at Repsol’s Cartagena plant, which can produce up to 250,000 tonnes of SAF per year.

When Will These SAF Initiatives Take Effect?

Each of these initiatives has a clear timeline for implementation. Spain’s Iberia SAF Circle program has already launched, and businesses can begin purchasing SAF for their flights as of October 2023. Singapore’s flight levy was introduced in 2023 and is set to expand as more airlines adopt SAF in the coming years. Indonesia’s SAF blend for international flights is scheduled to roll out by 2026, marking a major milestone in the country’s commitment to sustainable aviation.

These policies are designed not only to help airlines meet their sustainability goals but also to provide the necessary infrastructure and financial incentives to make SAF more accessible and affordable for both airlines and passengers.

Why Is Green Aviation Important?

The push for sustainable aviation is essential for addressing the environmental impact of the aviation industry. Air travel accounts for a significant portion of global carbon emissions, and without substantial changes, the sector will struggle to meet international climate goals. SAF is one of the most promising solutions, as it can significantly reduce emissions while maintaining the performance and safety standards of conventional jet fuel.

In addition to its environmental benefits, SAF represents a new frontier in energy production and biofuel technology. The growing demand for SAF will drive innovation and investment in biofuel production, creating new opportunities for businesses and communities in renewable energy sectors.

How Are Other Countries Responding?

Alongside Spain, Singapore, and Indonesia, other countries are also taking significant steps to promote SAF use. The United States, for example, has been working to ramp up SAF production through government incentives and partnerships with private sector stakeholders. The European Union is investing heavily in SAF research and development, with a goal to ensure SAF accounts for at least 5% of aviation fuel consumption by 2030.

In addition, Australia, Japan, and South Korea are also making strides in integrating SAF into their aviation industries. These countries have recognized the potential of SAF as a key component of their environmental strategies, aligning with international commitments to reduce carbon emissions across all sectors.

Conclusion

As countries like Spain, Singapore, and Indonesia lead the charge in integrating sustainable aviation fuels into their air travel systems, the push for greener skies is gaining momentum globally. With the aviation industry responsible for a significant share of carbon emissions, the adoption of SAF is crucial for meeting global climate goals and reducing the sector’s environmental footprint. By working together, governments, airlines, and energy producers can create a more sustainable future for air travel, one where emissions are minimized, and cleaner fuels power the skies.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/make-a-beautiuful-image-on-sustainable-a_LGsr-NFfQUaccIb1QMIAvA_6bhp1HBMQvW3gej8SDo-zg.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 12:56:44.177336

Delays in the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline keep reshaping plans across the Midwest. The project includes investment from Oklahoma City energy leader Harold Hamm. His involvement keeps Oklahoma tied to every major turn in this carbon capture story.

This week, Gevo Inc. moved a headline project out of South Dakota. The company will now build sustainable aviation fuel at an ethanol plant in Richardton, North Dakota. That site already captures carbon. It also sits inside a friendlier permitting climate.

Why Gevo moved

Local resistance and permitting fights slowed Summit’s route in South Dakota and Iowa.

Gevo CEO Patrick Gruber finally lost patience. “South Dakota is a very difficult place to do business. Everything is oppositional,” he told South Dakota Searchlight. “North Dakota is a breath of fresh air.”

Three years ago, Gevo broke ground on a $2.6 billion jet-fuel plant in Lake Preston. Leaders billed it as the state’s largest development project. However, the plan depended on carbon capture and pipeline access. The delays undermined that path. Therefore, Gevo shifted the project.

What it means for Summit and Oklahoma

The Richardton plant fits Summit’s model. Carbon capture sits at the center of sustainable aviation fuel economics. In 2022, Continental Resources, founded by Hamm, committed $250 million to Summit. The pipeline’s cost has since ballooned. Yet the core logic remains the same: connect ethanol plants to secure storage and cut lifecycle emissions.

North Dakota approved early carbon storage work. As a result, projects can tie in sooner. South Dakota still faces lawsuits and ballot fights. Iowa approved Summit with conditions, including permits in both Dakotas.

Jakarta (ANTARA) - Kementerian Perhubungan memperkuat kebijakan untuk mempercepat penggunaan bahan bakar penerbangan berkelanjutan (Sustainable Aviation Fuel/SAF) guna menerapkan dekarbonisasi industri aviasi nasional.

Direktur Kelaikudaraan dan Pengoperasian Pesawat Udara Ditjen Perhubungan Udara Kemenhub Sokhib Al Rokhman dalam keterangan diterima di Jakarta, Senin, mengatakan langkah percepatan kebijakan penggunaan SAF dilakukan melalui penguatan peta jalan, mekanisme pemantauan dan pelaporan emisi, serta penerapan skema Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) yang sesuai standar Organisasi Penerbangan Sipil Internasional (ICAO).

“Roadmap SAF, mekanisme MRV oleh operator, serta regulasi penerapan skema CORSIA telah disiapkan. Dengan sertifikasi sesuai ketentuan Ditjen Migas dan ICAO CORSIA, serta insentif yang proporsional, adopsi SAF di dalam negeri dapat dipercepat,” kata Sokhib.

Sokhib mengatakan Kemenhub berkomitmen memastikan seluruh kebijakan dekarbonisasi sektor penerbangan nasional berjalan sejalan dengan target penurunan emisi nasional dan standar global. Penggunaan SAF, kata dia, menjadi langkah strategis untuk menekan emisi karbon tanpa mengganggu operasional penerbangan yang sudah ada.

Hal itu disampaikan Sokhib dalam diskusi pada Pertamina Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Forum 2025 dengan tema “Sustainability: Indonesia’s Emission Reduction Ambition and the Benefits of SAF” yang menghadirkan pembicara lintas sektor dari maskapai, industri pesawat, lembaga sertifikasi dan pemerintah.

Dari sisi industri penerbangan, Country Manager Indonesia Cathay Pacific Airways Tony Sham menyebut potensi besar Indonesia sebagai pemasok SAF berbasis minyak jelantah di kawasan Asia, jika tantangan harga dan ketersediaan bahan baku dapat diatasi.

“Cathay Pacific menargetkan 10 persen pemakaian SAF pada 2030. Kolaborasi lintas pelaku menjadi kunci untuk mempercepat transisi ini,” ujarnya.

Sementara itu, Senior Managing Director Boeing Malcom An menilai kawasan Asia Tenggara memiliki sumber daya memadai untuk memenuhi kebutuhan bahan bakar berkelanjutan secara mandiri.

“Minat untuk mengubah minyak jelantah dan limbah pertanian menjadi SAF terus meningkat. Kawasan ini bahkan berpotensi memproduksi lebih untuk diekspor,” katanya.

Dari sisi standar mutu, CEO Qualitas Sertifikasi Indonesia Ryanza Prasetya menjelaskan pentingnya penerapan International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) CORSIA guna memastikan integritas rantai pasok SAF.

Sertifikasi tersebut, ujarnya, menjamin asal bahan baku, perhitungan emisi, dan ketelusuran produksi sesuai standar global.

Direktur Utama Pertamina Patra Niaga Mars Ega Legowo Putra mengatakan, melalui penyelenggaraan forum ini, Pertamina memperkuat peran sebagai penggerak utama pengembangan energi bersih untuk industri penerbangan.

Pertamina Group diketahui telah memanfaatkan minyak jelantah sebagai bahan baku SAF melalui ekosistem terintegrasi mulai dari pengumpulan, pengolahan, hingga distribusi.

Langkah tersebut diharapkan dapat menekan emisi karbon sekaligus menciptakan nilai ekonomi sirkular bagi masyarakat.

The company, via its business unit MyRechemical, has been awarded a contract by Altalto Ltd. to develop an engineering study for the construction of a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) plant in Immingham, Lincolnshire, United Kingdom. The facility is expected to become operational by 2030 and will produce 30 million liters of SAF per year—equivalent to approximately 23,000 tons of low-carbon fuel.

This initiative aligns with the UK’s SAF Mandate, part of the national strategy to cut greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by at least 50% by 2050. The plant will convert residual municipal solid waste (MSW) and commercial and industrial (C&I) waste into high-quality synthetic fuel, turning non-recyclable waste into a valuable energy resource.

According to project estimates, the annual fuel output will be sufficient to power over 500 transatlantic flights between London and New York, reducing net CO₂ emissions by more than 100,000 tons per year. This substantial climate impact will be further enhanced by the integration of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies, designed to capture and reuse CO₂ released during production.

Advanced Waste-to-Fuel Technologies

At the core of the Immingham project are NextChem’s proprietary NX Circular and NX CPO technologies. The NX Circular process converts waste into synthesis gas (syngas), which is then transformed into SynCrude through Velocys’s Fischer-Tropsch technology. This intermediate product is subsequently refined into high-quality sustainable fuels suitable for aviation. The NX CPO system, based on a controlled partial oxidation process, further optimizes carbon efficiency and maximizes yield while minimizing environmental impact.

Through MyRechemical, NextChem will act as the technology provider and coordinator among the industrial partners involved in the project. The NX Engineering District in Catania, together with other Maire Group companies, will provide technical and operational support during both the design and implementation phases.

Maire’s technological approach underlines the increasing role of waste-to-chemical processes in the circular economy. By transforming waste streams into energy products, these solutions can significantly reduce landfill use, cut methane emissions, and support the decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation. Globally, SAF is expected to represent up to 10% of total aviation fuel consumption by 2030, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), with production expected to rise from the current 0.5 billion liters to over 30 billion liters annually.

Economic and Employment Impact

Beyond its environmental benefits, the Immingham project is expected to have major economic and social impacts. Supported by the UK Department for Transport’s Advanced Fuels Fund, the initiative will generate around 1,000 direct and 300 indirect jobs during the construction phase, while creating approximately 100 permanent positions once operational. The investment will also contribute to strengthening the UK’s energy security by reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels and stimulating the local industrial supply chain.

According to Altalto, the project will attract new private capital and foster long-term innovation partnerships within the British bioenergy and waste management sectors. Moreover, by producing low-carbon fuel domestically, the UK could save up to £50 million per year in import costs while cutting lifecycle emissions by 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

For Fabio Fritelli, Managing Director of NextChem, “this recognition confirms the validity and flexibility of our technological proposal, which meets the needs of mobility sector players, particularly in aviation where decarbonization is of fundamental importance.” His statement wants to underscore the strategic vision driving Maire’s international expansion and its role as a leading developer of circular and low-carbon solutions.

Only two airlines, Air France and British Airways, operated the original Concorde commercially, starting in 1976.
Due to the loud sonic booms created by breaking the sound barrier, its flights were restricted to transatlantic routes over the ocean.
Described as 'quiet', the aircraft's special design means it will make a thump noise instead of a loud sonic boom.","More than 20 years since the Concorde made its final journey, industry insiders have confirmed that the next generation of supersonic jets could enter service in the next few years.

The announcement follows the signing of new US legislation this June, removing bans on supersonic travel over land.

This has been made possible by modern noise-reduction technologies that suppress the loud sonic booms, which was a criticism of the original Concorde.

The new aircraft unofficially dubbed 'Concorde 2.0' is being led by Fly‑Concorde Ltd, a company backed by international engineers and aviation innovators, according to Euro Weekly News.

The updated version of the Concorde will feature a host of new design elements and cutting-edge technology.

The aircraft will be powered by sustainable aviation fuel, weigh approximately 50 per cent less than its predecessor and fly at altitudes of up to 60,000 feet.

Reports suggest that the first commercial services are being timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Concorde's maiden transatlantic crossing in 1976.

Journey times on routes such as London to New York, or Los Angeles to Washington, could be reduced to just two hours - a drop from the current six to seven hours.

Ticket prices are expected to be high initially, appealing to business travellers and premium fliers.

However, manufacturers hope that operating costs will eventually come down, allowing broader public access to ultra-fast travel.

Though not a direct relaunch of the original Concorde, which was decommissioned in 2003, this new chapter in aviation honours its legacy while embracing 21st-century environmental and technological standards.

The Concorde was the first turbojet-powered supersonic airliner to enter service flying passengers across the Atlantic at twice the speed of sound.

Only two airlines, Air France and British Airways, operated the original Concorde commercially, starting in 1976.

Due to the loud sonic booms created by breaking the sound barrier, its flights were restricted to transatlantic routes over the ocean.

Concorde's famous passengers included royalty, musicians, actors, and politicians, such as Queen Elizabeth II, Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger and Joan Collins.

Concorde made its last-ever flight on November 26, 2003, departing Heathrow Airport and landing in Bristol, greeted by a cheering crowd gathered behind fences near the runway

It comes as NASA's X-59, a supersonic research aircraft, could fly from the capital of the UK to New York in around three hours and 44 minutes.

For the Airbus A320neo family, for instance, the company supplies the high bypass geared turbofan engines collectively called GTF.

The breed has been around for decades now, and it didn't seem in need of an upgrade, but Pratt & Whitney thinks differently, and that's why over the past few years it has been busy developing something called the GTF Advantage, an updated version of the current PW1100G powerplant.

The main reason why the company opted to revise the engine was to give A320neo operators enhanced payload and range, but also a more durable configuration that could double the engine's time on wing. As a bonus, more thrust (4 percent more at sea level and 8 percent more at high-altitude airports) is also thrown into the mix.

The engine got the type certification for the Airbus A320neo family from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) earlier this year, but now Pratt & Whitney announced the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) cleared it as well – and this opens the door for the GTF Advantage to take off for the first time commercially in 2026.

Hailed as a game-changer for operators, the powerplant will be offered on new A320neo aircraft, but the ones that use the current GTF could make use of it as well, as the two versions are intermixable and interchangeable. In the not-so-distant future, Pratt & Whitney plans to make the Advantage the new production standard.

There are a few key upgrades that should make the Advantage a better choice than the current variant, including the lowest fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for single-aisle aircraft, increased airflow in the core that results in lower operating temperatures, and a new airfoil design in the high-pressure turbine.

As a bonus, the engine will probably be fully compatible with future versions of the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and it will likely be able to operate entirely on this kind of source of energy.

The engine maker does not say who will be the first customer to use the new engine but says it already has 11,000 orders for the extended GF family. And that's saying something, seeing how there are only 2,200 GTF-powered aircraft flying in the sky today, serving the needs of no less than 80 operators.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/new-pratt-whitney-engine-for-the-airbus-a320neo-cleared-to-fly-in-2026-259512_1.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 10:56:25.768930

Together, they paint a compelling picture — one where Ethiopia could become a continental leader in bioethanol and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production.

From Cassava to Sustainable Jet Fuel

Ethiopia’s biofuel journey began with a simple ambition: to reduce fuel imports and create rural jobs through domestic ethanol production.

The RSB Biofuel Strategy reaffirmed this goal, setting out a policy roadmap built on three pillars:

Feedstock expansion – large-scale cassava and sugarcane development with smallholder out-growers.

National blending mandates – progressive ethanol blending targets of E10 → E20, backed by fuel security objectives.

Private-sector participation – incentives for investors through public-private partnerships, concessional finance, and tax reliefs.

Today, Ethiopia already produces ethanol from molasses for both E5 fuel blending and clean cooking, but supply remains far below potential. With the sugar sector under reform, the government aims to revive underutilised estates like Finchaa, Metehara, and Kessem — creating a platform for industrial biofuel expansion.

The Alcohol-to-Jet Advantage

The World Bank’s 2024 SAF report identifies Ethiopia as one of Africa’s most promising locations for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production.Its techno-economic modelling found that the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) pathway is the optimal technology for Ethiopia — both technically and economically.

“An investment of $376 million in an alcohol-to-jet facility could meet 6 percent of Ethiopia’s jet-fuel demand,”

notes the World Bank, highlighting sugarcane and molasses as the most viable feedstocks.

Unlike other SAF pathways such as Fischer-Tropsch or hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA), ATJ leverages Ethiopia’s existing ethanol infrastructure.By converting fermented ethanol into jet fuel through dehydration, oligomerisation and hydrogenation, the country can extend the value chain of its bioethanol industry into aviation fuels — a strategic advantage few African nations possess.

Market Potential Across Transport, Cooking and Aviation

The RSB Biofuel Strategy forecasts a combined national bioethanol demand exceeding 250–350 million litres per year by 2030:

This multi-sector demand base offers investors a diversified revenue model: domestic blending, clean-cooking distribution, and exportable SAF via book-and-claim systems under ICAO CORSIA or EU ReFuelEU frameworks.

Policy Tailwinds: Ethiopia’s Biofuel Transformation

Both the RSB and World Bank highlight clear policy imperatives driving the sector:

Energy security – Biofuels reduce dependency on imported petroleum, saving scarce foreign exchange.

Climate alignment – SAF from sugarcane or molasses can cut lifecycle emissions by >60 percent, meeting international certification thresholds.

Investment readiness – Reforms to open Ethiopia’s fuel import market and attract private capital mark a decisive shift toward liberalisation.

Social inclusion – Out-grower programmes ensure rural communities share in value creation from feedstock production.

The Road Ahead

Ethiopia’s next decade will be defined by its ability to turn feedstock abundance into refined fuels.

With ATJ technology as its backbone, the country can establish a vertically integrated renewable-fuel value chain — from sugarcane farms to SAF-ready airports.

But success will hinge on coordinated action:

government policy enforcement,

concessional financing from development banks,

and strategic partnerships with global fuel offtakers.

As the World Bank concludes, “Ethiopia’s heavy reliance on imported jet fuel makes local SAF production a strategic priority for enhancing energy security and reducing operational costs for its aviation sector.”

In Summary

Ethiopia stands on the threshold of a renewable-fuel revolution. With the RSB setting the policy vision and the World Bank validating the economics, the country has all the ingredients — feedstock, demand, and intent — to become Africa’s first integrated bioethanol-to-SAF hub.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e95502_8a6eaa7b1cf64a11a228fc036c0f20a8~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1536,h_1024,al_c/e95502_8a6eaa7b1cf64a11a228fc036c0f20a8~mv2.png",N,,2025-10-20 12:01:20.615806

Sovereign wealth fund Danantara said Monday that it was still reviewing the feasibility of the government-backed projects worth over $38 billion projects in the country’s downstream industries before deciding to make some investments.

Energy Minister Bahlil Lahadalia had drawn up a list of 18 projects worth $38.63 billion that Indonesia wishes to work on with Danantara’s help. The projects spans various resources, all aimed at getting Indonesia to move up the value chain by producing higher-valued goods. Bahlil, who leads the downstream development task force, had handed over these projects’ pre-feasibility documents to Danantara in late July. The ball remains in Danantara’s court, as the fund -- which now controls all state-owned enterprises -- intends to only finance projects that they deem “investment-ready”. According to Danantara’s chief executive officer Rosan Roeslani, the reviews are still ongoing, while admitting that some projects required “fine-tuning”.

""We will keep in touch with the Energy Ministry,"" Rosan told the press in Jakarta.

“There are some projects that need some adjustments, including on the projections,” he said.

Rosan did not disclose the timeframe of when the reviews would likely finish, nor the details of the projects that still needed some improvements. Bahlil’s aide Ahmad Erani Yustika not long ago told reporters that the review would likely finish by the end of the year, saying that Indonesia would like to actually execute the plan “as soon as possible”.

A few days ago, Bahlil told the 18 projects could directly create “almost 300,000 jobs” within the targeted industries. It is expected to generate a million jobs in indirect employment, thus possibly spurring a more equitable growth in regions outside Java.

Past media reports showed that some of the projects included coal gasification, palm oil-based oleofood, and sustainable aviation fuel based on cooking oil. When Danantara received the pre-feasibility study documents, Rosan said at the time that the fund was open to partnering with both state-run and private-owned firms in financially backing the projects.

According to government’s estimates, the resource-rich Indonesia needs up to $618 billion investments to develop the downstream industries of its minerals, oil, forestry, fishery, marine, and plantation commodities, by 2040. Indonesia needs $498.4 billion in investments to turn its raw minerals and coal into higher valued goods. Indonesia began this budget-heavy industrialization with nickel -- a key ingredient in electric vehicle battery production. The Southeast Asian country had stopped exporting unprocessed nickel in 2020, only wanting to sell half-finished or finished goods made from the silvery white metal. The policy has ruffled Europe’s feathers, but became a major economic driver. Indonesia’s nickel derivative exports only reached $3.3 billion in 2017, but soared to $33.9 billion last year.

is ISO-certified (ISO 9001 and ISO 14001), indicating strong quality controls and environmental systems.

operates on a cost-neutral basis, meaning it is not profit-driven, allowing for competitive fee structures.

delivers 24/7 responsiveness, backed by a global network of surveyors in key locations.

supports multiple regimes (for yachts): pleasure yachts, commercial yachts, and new schemes like Yachts Engaged in Trade (YETs).

supports title registration for merchant ships and allows mortgages to be registered against vessels.

has a simpler Part II register for 'small ships' (less than 24m) which offers a lighter-touch regime with fewer requirements (though without mortgage capability).

has fairly broad ownership eligibility including individuals, body corporates, and limited partnerships, subject to criteria (residency, place of incorporation, etc.).

supports flexibility in structuring for example, appointment of a local 'representative person' when required (for non-Isle of Man owners of vessels over 24 m).

is a British register, which means Isle of Man-flagged vessels enjoy the right to fly the Red Ensign and benefit from access to British diplomatic and naval support globally.

is careful to position itself not as a 'flag of convenience', emphasising its quality, compliance, and professional oversight.

These features give owners both flexibility and peace of mind.

The Isle of Man Aircraft Registry

Meanwhile, the Isle of Man has long been a jurisdiction of choice for private and corporate jet ownership and registration. The Isle of Man Aircraft Registry's client base includes some of the most prominent global operators and high-net-worth individuals who value efficient service, regulatory confidence, and international recognition. It:

has registered over 1,000 aircraft (to date) and is ranked among the top dedicated private/corporate registers globally. Total aircraft currently on register is 285 (194 business jets, 37 helicopters, 29 turboprop, 9 light aircraft and 16 transactional aircraft) – as at 28 May 2025.

has the motto 'Safety with Service', balancing high regulatory standards with client-centric responsiveness.

uses an online platform, ARDIS, enabling digital services like registration searches, reservation of out-of-sequence registration marks, mortgage searches, and invoice payments.

accepts corporate/private jets, twin turbine helicopters, and in some cases smaller turbine aircraft (or light aircraft owned by Island residents).

has the nationality mark ""M-"" followed by four characters (for example, M-YJET, M-ANDY). The neutrality of that prefix is an advantage in some jurisdictions or regions.

allows personalised registration marks are permitted, and the prefix may be recycled across different airframes.

offers flexibility in acceptance of airworthiness, crew licences, and maintenance programmes, so long as they comply with major recognised standards (FAA, EASA, JAA etc.).

is aligned with the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) of the Isle of Man, and oversight is anchored in compliance with ICAO standards and recommended practices.

is trusted by financiers, with a published aircraft mortgage register, enhancing lender comfort.

has won many awards including Best Global Aviation Registry (in 2019 and 2020) in the World Commerce Review Awards.

These combined features make the Isle of Man particularly attractive to owners of corporate jets and high-end aviation assets.

Why Choose the Isle of Man?

Add the Island's renowned corporate structuring capabilities to the above, and the message is clear: this is a jurisdiction that moves assets that move the world.

So, what makes the Isle of Man such a trusted home for global assets?

At the core lies stability; politically, economically, and reputationally. The Island operates under its own government, legal system, and regulatory frameworks, offering a balance of autonomy and alignment with the UK and international standards.

Its regulatory environment is robust but pragmatic, ensuring compliance without unnecessary complexity. Both the Ship and Aircraft Registries are known for their responsiveness, technical expertise, and most importantly, client-centric approach; rare qualities in a global landscape often dominated by bureaucracy.

Beyond policy, there's credibility, built over decades. The Isle of Man has invested in professionalism, transparency, and innovation to ensure that its registries and corporate service providers aren't just keeping pace with global change but helping to shape it.

The global asset landscape continues to evolve rapidly. Owners are increasingly influenced by ESG considerations, digital transformation, and shifting geopolitics.

We're seeing a growing preference for jurisdictions that demonstrate environmental and ethical accountability, qualities the Isle of Man has embraced through its Blue Carbon initiatives, zero-emission maritime goals, and commitment to sustainable regulation.

Digitalisation is also reshaping compliance and administration, with e-registration, blockchain verification, and AI-assisted governance becoming part of the new norm. The Island's forward-thinking approach positions it well to adapt, and even lead, in this changing world.

As international regulation tightens and perceptions around transparency evolve, the Isle of Man remains steady, trusted, and agile, and these are qualities that global asset owners value now more than ever.

So, whether it's a superyacht cruising the Mediterranean or a jet crossing the Atlantic, its roots may well trace back to a small island in the Irish Sea.

How can we assist?

For asset owners, choosing where to register is just one part of a much larger picture.

Behind every ship, yacht, or jet lies more than just an asset – there's ownership, governance, and legacy at stake.

At Sentient International, we specialise in creating the robust structures that sit behind these global assets.

Working alongside clients and their advisors, we set up and administer structures that align with international tax, regulatory, and family governance frameworks, supporting everything from private aviation holdings and shipping groups to family offices managing diverse portfolios. Whether through trusts, companies, or bespoke succession vehicles, we ensure that ownership is secure, compliant, and built to endure.

A travel expert has shed light on what the resurgence of supersonic air travel could mean for future passengers. Nearly two decades after the grounding of the iconic Concorde, it appears the legendary aircraft may soon grace our skies once more.

Tech firms are suggesting that by 2026, passengers could be experiencing supersonic journeys again, with flight durations significantly shorter than those currently offered by commercial airlines. One might question why it's taken so long for supersonic flight to stage a comeback - but a pivotal development has now paved the way. In June 2025, the United States enacted a key piece of legislation that lifted the longstanding ban on supersonic travel over land.

As reported by Euro Weekly News, this significant policy shift opens up the potential for new routes across North America and beyond. The original Concorde was criticised for its noise levels, but updated models aim to address this issue with contemporary noise-reduction technology, reports the Express.

The revival is being spearheaded by FlyConcorde Ltd, a firm supported by international engineers and aviation innovators. Their revamped version of the Concorde will boast a range of new design features and state-of-the-art technology.

The aircraft will run on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), weigh roughly 50% less than its 20th-century predecessor, and fly at altitudes of up to 60,000 feet. Nicholas Smith, Holidays Digital Director at Thomas Cook and eSky online travel agency, told Express.co.uk: ""While it's thrilling to imagine this aviation icon back in the skies, it's unlikely to appeal to the average holidaymaker from the UK jetting off to Benidorm for a week in the sun.

""We see the future of mainstream air travel heading towards larger, more efficient aircraft designed to carry more people, not fewer. That said, a modern relaunch focused on sustainability, digital innovation, and safety could carve out a niche for high-end, short-haul luxury routes - such as London to New York in under four hours.

""It's not a mass-market solution, but for time-sensitive premium travellers, it could once again become the pinnacle of prestige flying.""

Reports indicate that the inaugural commercial flights are planned to mark the 50th anniversary of Concorde's first transatlantic voyage in 1976.

Flight durations on routes including London to New York or Los Angeles to Washington could be slashed to merely two hours - a substantial reduction from the present six to seven hours.",https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/article32712529.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_British-Airways-Concorde-Farnborough-International-Airshow-September-10th-1986.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 12:01:35.578054

IndiGo has cemented its position as a major player in global aviation with a strategic order of 30 Airbus A350-900 aircraft, marking a significant step in its expansion into the long-haul international market. This firm commitment follows a Memorandum of Understanding signed earlier in the year and is set to transform the airline’s operations, enabling it to connect India to more destinations across the globe. With the A350’s advanced fuel efficiency, long-range capabilities, and cutting-edge technology, IndiGo is well-equipped to meet the rising demand for international travel, offering passengers more options and greater connectivity while reinforcing India’s position as a global aviation hub.

IndiGo, India’s largest airline, has firmly committed to expanding its fleet with the purchase of 30 Airbus A350-900 aircraft. This new firm order follows the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed earlier in June, raising IndiGo’s total number of A350 aircraft to 60. This major step signifies IndiGo’s entry into the long-haul international market, positioning the airline for substantial growth in global aviation.

The Airbus A350-900 will serve as a key element in IndiGo’s expansion strategy, enabling the airline to operate long-haul flights more efficiently and at a lower operating cost.

Maritime shipping accounts for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and are on track to roughly double by 2050 under most economic scenarios.
Shipping emissions are also among the most difficult to address, with a need to develop and implement low emissions fuels, infrastructure and technologies in order to significantly reduce the sector’s climate footprint.
The draft framework included a series of international regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, including a global fuel standard, and the establishment of a global carbon pricing mechanism.
It requires action and support from the entire shipping ecosystem, including fuel producers, ship owners, regulators, and many more.","The International Maritime Organization (IMO), the 176-member state UN agency responsible for developing global standards for shipping, announced that its member states have voted to delay the adoption of the “IMO Net-Zero Framework,” a global agreement aimed at implementing measures to reduce the climate impact of ocean shipping.

The establishment of the international net zero shipping framework was delayed despite an initial draft receiving majority support in April, following significant pressure from the U.S.’ Trump administration, which had threatened a series of retaliatory actions against nations supporting the agreement.

Maritime shipping accounts for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and are on track to roughly double by 2050 under most economic scenarios. Shipping emissions are also among the most difficult to address, with a need to develop and implement low emissions fuels, infrastructure and technologies in order to significantly reduce the sector’s climate footprint.

The draft framework included a series of international regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, including a global fuel standard, and the establishment of a global carbon pricing mechanism.

Under the framework, ships would be required to comply with a new global fuel standard to reduce their annual GHG fuel intensity (GFI) over time, with ships above the GFI thresholds required to balance their emissions deficit by transferring “surplus units” earned by other ships or used surplus units they may have already banked, or to purchase remedial units.

Proceeds from the sale of remedial units would contribute to an IMO Net-Zero Fund, rewarding low-emission ships, supporting innovation, research, infrastructure and just transition initiatives in developing countries, funding technology transfer and capacity building to support the IMO GHG Strategy, and mitigating negative impacts on vulnerable states.

The April framework was approved by 63 nations in April, while the U.S. publicly opposed the agreement and left the negotiations prior to the vote, following which the administration warned of “reciprocal measures” to compensate for any fees under the new framework charged to U.S. ships, and “for any other economic harm from any adopted GHG emissions measures.”

Prior to the beginning of negotiations to adopt the framework last week, the U.S. State Department issued a communication stating that “the Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO,” and detailing a series of actions that it would consider on nations supporting the framework, including “considering potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking vessels registered in those countries,” imposing visa restrictions on crews, imposing commercial penalties and additional port fees, and “evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers,” among other potential measures.

A motion to delay the negotiations on the framework by a year put forward by Singapore and tabled for a vote by Saudi Arabia was agreed to by 57 countries, and opposed by 49, with 21 abstaining.

Industry participants expressed disappointment with the delay, citing the uncertainty it will create in their emissions reduction initiatives and investments. In a statement following the announcement, shipping giant Maersk called the decision “a loss of momentum for the shipping industry’s efforts to decarbonize,” and that it now must “await further clarity on the road ahead and on how the IMO intends to continue the work on the Net Zero Framework.”

Maersk added:

“The energy transition of the shipping industry has never been an easy task. It requires action and support from the entire shipping ecosystem, including fuel producers, ship owners, regulators, and many more.

Sustainable aviation initiatives not only reduce emissions but also enhance the appeal of these destinations as leaders in responsible tourism.
The combination of a flight levy, centralized fuel procurement, and regional collaboration offers a replicable model for sustainable air transport.","The global aviation sector is entering a new era of environmental accountability, and Singapore is taking a decisive step forward. In a landmark move, the nation has passed a parliamentary bill that imposes a fixed flight levy aimed at curbing carbon emissions and fostering the widespread use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This initiative places Singapore at the forefront of green aviation in Asia, setting a precedent for other nations seeking to balance air travel growth with environmental sustainability. The levy will be collected by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), which will utilize the funds to procure and manage SAF across airlines operating from the city-state.

With air travel rebounding strongly after the pandemic and climate change remaining a global concern, Singapore’s decision reflects a forward-thinking approach that blends economic resilience with ecological responsibility. The nation aims to increase SAF usage to more than 1% by 2026, with an ambitious plan to expand that figure to 3–5% by 2030. The initiative not only supports environmental goals but also reassures travelers that sustainable flying can remain affordable and accessible.

Singapore’s Flight Levy: A Step Toward Sustainable Air Travel

Under the newly approved policy, every departing flight from Singapore will include a fixed levy collected by CAAS. The funds will directly support the procurement and management of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, ensuring that airlines contribute to emission reduction efforts. According to Singapore’s Senior Minister of State for Transport Sun Xueling, this centralized approach will enable the government to manage resources efficiently and negotiate better terms with global suppliers of SAF.

This model marks a shift from the traditional airline-by-airline procurement of fuel toward a unified, government-led strategy. The goal is to aggregate SAF demand across carriers, which would help achieve economies of scale and stabilize prices in a market where sustainable fuel production remains limited and costly.

By ensuring consistent SAF availability, Singapore is also positioning itself as a strategic hub for green aviation in the Asia-Pacific region — a move that complements its reputation as a global air transport center and tourism gateway.

The Cost Impact: Shared Responsibility for a Greener Future

Concerns often arise when new environmental levies are introduced, particularly regarding potential fare hikes. However, Singaporean authorities have clarified that the new levy will not cause a significant increase in airfares. The additional cost will be modest — approximately S$3 (US$2.30) per passenger for an economy-class direct flight, depending on the travel distance.

Rather than placing the entire burden on airlines or passengers, the initiative distributes the cost evenly across all air transport users. This balanced model reflects a principle of shared responsibility, encouraging travelers, operators, and policymakers to work collectively toward achieving a carbon-neutral aviation sector.

The modest increase is a small price to pay for a cleaner sky and a more sustainable future. For eco-conscious travelers, it also offers an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to environmental preservation each time they fly.

Why Sustainable Aviation Fuel Matters

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that Sustainable Aviation Fuel could deliver up to 65% of the emissions reductions needed for the global aviation industry to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. However, SAF currently accounts for just 0.7% of global aviation fuel use, leaving a long road ahead for scaling up production and adoption.

SAF is typically produced from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural waste, and other bio-based materials. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF significantly lowers lifecycle carbon emissions — in some cases by up to 80%. It can also be blended seamlessly with existing jet fuel, allowing airlines to use it without modifying their aircraft engines.

By driving demand through policy, Singapore is creating market confidence that could stimulate global investment in SAF production. This move aligns with the broader sustainable tourism movement, as travelers increasingly prefer airlines and destinations that demonstrate environmental responsibility.

Regional Momentum: Thailand Joins the Sustainable Push

Singapore’s leadership is already inspiring regional action. In neighboring Thailand, the Department of Energy Business has announced that the country’s first national standard for SAF specifications will be released within this month. The new standard will come into effect on January 1 next year, marking a significant milestone in Southeast Asia’s collective effort to reduce the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.

By developing standardized fuel criteria, Thailand is ensuring that locally produced and imported SAF meets international quality and safety benchmarks. This alignment will facilitate easier trade and cooperation across borders, allowing airlines to adopt eco-friendly fuel options with greater confidence.

Together, Singapore and Thailand are creating a blueprint for sustainable aviation in Asia, setting the stage for other countries to follow suit.

Tourism and the Future of Green Aviation in Asia

For the tourism sector, these developments could not come at a better time. Post-pandemic travel demand continues to soar, but so do concerns about the environmental consequences of flying. By integrating sustainability into aviation policy, Singapore and Thailand are sending a clear message that growth and responsibility can coexist.

Eco-conscious tourists are increasingly seeking destinations that prioritize environmental ethics, and the rise of SAF-backed flights offers them tangible ways to make greener travel choices. Sustainable aviation initiatives not only reduce emissions but also enhance the appeal of these destinations as leaders in responsible tourism.

Travelers arriving at Changi Airport or exploring the natural wonders of Thailand can now be part of a global sustainability journey — one that connects leisure, business, and climate action.

Global Context: Aligning With Long-Term Climate Goals

Singapore’s levy aligns closely with the global aviation industry’s broader sustainability roadmap. As countries pledge to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement, initiatives like this help bridge the gap between ambition and action.

By leveraging its role as an international aviation hub, Singapore demonstrates how small island nations can exert outsized influence on global environmental policy. Its proactive stance could encourage more nations to introduce green levies or adopt centralized SAF procurement systems.

The ripple effect could accelerate investment in SAF production facilities, stimulate technological innovation, and ultimately lower costs for airlines and passengers worldwide.

A Greener Horizon for Global Air Travel

Replacing windows with cameras and a 4K resolution feed also improves both the aerodynamics and fuel efficiency enough to make chartering private more affordable than business class.

Otto Aerospace has tentatively earmarked 2027 for the Phantom 3500’s maiden flight.

In an industry that prides itself on providing more, Otto Aerospace has found a path forward by stripping something away (sort of).

As first reported by The Wall Street Journal, the Texas-based aviation company’s Phantom 3500 business jet will soon be carrying nine passengers at a time across the skies… without traditional single windows.

Instead, the cabin is wrapped in towering six-foot-wide digital panes, each powered by high-resolution exterior cameras, offering fliers enhanced 4K renders of the horizon in colour-saturated clarity (something Otto Aerospace CEO Paul Touw dubbed “supernatural vision”).

“You could sit in our seat and look at the entire world around you… It is surreal,” Touw told The Wall Street Journal.

But this isn’t just another vanity project to benefit one-percenters.

Without the structural weight of windows, Otto Aerospace’s teardrop-shaped private jet promises a 60% cut in fuel burn compared with peers – a radical efficiency that could, in theory, make chartering private cheaper than flying business class on commercial carriers.

The concept has already seduced the likes of Flexjet, one of America’s biggest names in private aviation, inking a contract valued at an estimated US$5.85 billion for 300 Phantom 3500s – deliveries are slated for the early 2030s.

Flexjet – valued north of US$4 billion and recently buoyed by an US$800 million injection from LVMH-affiliated private equity firm L Catterton, is betting that its clientele (CEOs, ultra-high-net-worth families, younger generation of tech-native flyers) will embrace the Instagrammable novelty and Trojan gamechanger.

For context, the company already curates rarefied perks like Napa Valley tastings and philanthropic galas. A futuristic, windowless cabin feels like the natural extension of its brand.

And as for Otto Aerospace, the Phantom 3500 is just the beginning.

Backed by US$250 million in private investment and an additional US$515 million state government incentive package, the start-up has built its first full-scale mockup and is already eyeing larger regional aircraft once Phantom jet takes hold; with the US$43 billion annual market for business aviation at stake – far more lucrative than the frontier fantasies of space tourism, claims Paul Touw.

“Everybody’s running around excited about Firefly and SpaceX. But the market for moving wealthy people around the world every day is actually much bigger than the market for moving stuff into space,” said the chief executive.

The cherry on top of this exceedingly ambitious sundae?

Este foro ha servido como espacio de reflexión y diálogo sobre cómo avanzar hacia una aviación sostenible y el papel del combustible de aviación sostenible (SAF del inglés Sustainable Aviation Fuel) para conseguirlo.

Rocío Blanco, consejera de Empleo, Empresa y Trabajo Autónomo de la Junta de Andalucía, inauguró el evento destacando el crecimiento histórico del sector, que superó los 15.000 trabajadores el año pasado, gracias a la colaboración público-privada.

La descarbonización es el principal desafío del sector aéreo, el cual es responsable de casi el 3 % de las emisiones globales de CO2 en Europa. En este contexto, el Combustible Sostenible de Aviación (SAF) se perfila como la solución tecnológica más rápida y eficiente para alcanzar el objetivo de cero emisiones netas en 2050.

Álvaro Macarro, director de Aviación Sostenible de Moeve, enfatizó que, si bien el primer año del mandato ReFuelEU Aviation activó el mercado con un aumento de la demanda y la concienciación, el principal reto para España es de tipo regulatorio y de inversión, no tecnológico.

El director de Moeve señaló que los Estados miembros deben complementar el impulso generado por el mercado con políticas nacionales que faciliten tanto la producción como el acceso al combustible sostenible.

A pesar de los desafíos de implementación, la producción de SAF presenta un gran potencial económico para España. Se estima que este desarrollo podría generar hasta 56.000 millones de euros de impacto en el Producto Interior Bruto (PIB) en el año 2050, según un informe elaborado por Moeve, Iberia, Vueling, BIOCIRC y PwC.

Andalucía se posiciona como una región estratégica en este desarrollo industrial. Moeve está construyendo en el Parque Energético La Rábida, en Huelva, el mayor complejo de biocombustibles de segunda generación del sur de Europa. Esta instalación tendrá una capacidad de producción anual superior al millón de toneladas de diésel HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) 100 % renovable y SAF.

Nyt fuusioteknologia on Pohjoismaissa askeleen lähempänä toteutumista.

Novatron Fusion Group (NFG) - ainoa yksityinen fuusioenergiayhtiö Pohjoismaissa - kehittää magneettiseen peiliin perustuvaa fuusioreaktorikonseptia, jonka tavoitteena on luoda kaupallisesti kannattava ja kustannustehokas puhtaan energian lähde. Päätöksenteon tueksi NFG tilasi VTT:ltä selvityksen mahdollisista pilottifuusioreaktorin sijoituspaikoista neljässä Pohjoismaassa.

Raportin tutkimustulokset esitellään tänään Espoossa järjestettävässä Nordic Fusion Forum -tapahtumassa. Tilaisuudessa puhuva Suomen ympäristö- ja ilmastoministeri Sari Multala korostaa, että fuusioteknologian läpimurrot ovat käymässä toteen:

""Läpimurrot fuusioteknologiassa eivät ole enää pelkkää teoriaa. Digitalisaation ja tekoälyn hyödyntäminen on varmasti auttanut, mutta ennen kaikkea olemme päässeet näin pitkälle tutkijoiden ja insinöörien kovan työn ja päättäväisyyden ansiosta”, Multala sanoo.

VTT:n analyysissa tarkasteltiin sääntelyyn, ympäristökysymyksiin sekä operatiivisiin ja yhteiskunnallisiin tekijöihin liittyviä haasteita ja mahdollisuuksia kussakin maassa.

Parhaat mahdollisuudet löytyvät olemassa olevilta teollisuusalueilta lähellä tutkimuskeskittymiä

VTT:n tutkimusryhmän johtaja Markus Airila kertoo, että lupaavimmat sijainnit fuusioreaktorille löytyvät jo olemassa olevilta teollisuusalueilta, joissa on hyvät liikenneyhteydet.

”Satamien ja tutkimuskeskittymien läheisyys sekä raskaan liikenteen maayhteydet ovat sopivimpien paikkojen tärkeimpiä ominaisuuksia”, Airila sanoo.

Tutkimuksen mukaan lupaavimmat alueet pilottifuusioreaktorille ovat:

Suomessa pääkaupunkiseutu noin 50 kilometrin säteellä Helsingistä

Ruotsissa Tukholman ja Nyköpingin välinen alue

Kööpenhaminan ja Malmön metropolialue Tanskan ja Ruotsin rajalla

Lisäksi tutkimuksessa tunnistettiin noin kymmenen toissijaista sijoituspaikkaa, jotka jakautuvat kaikkien neljän maan kesken.

Sääntelyvalmius vaihtelee Pohjoismaissa

Fuusioenergialla on vielä selvitettävänään tiettyjä sääntelyn esteitä. Maiden sääntely-ympäristöjä vertailleessa tutkimuksessa todetaan, että Suomen lainsäädäntö on tässä suhteessa kehittyneintä ja Ruotsi seuraa tiiviisti perässä.

Suomi uudistaa parhaillaan ydinenergialakiaan, mikä yksinkertaistaa lupaprosessia ja vähentää esteitä pilottifuusiokohteille. Muutosten odotetaan astuvan voimaan vuonna 2027.

”Samankaltaista lähestymistapaa noudattamalla muut Pohjoismaat vahvistaisivat asemaansa kansainvälisellä fuusiosektorilla”, VTT:n Markus Airila sanoo.

Maat, joilla on oma fuusiostrategia ja erillinen lainsäädäntö fuusiolle ja fissiolle, ovat laitosten kehittäjille houkuttelevampia, sillä ne vähentävät ei-teknisiä riskejä.

Ruotsilla on vakiintunut ydinenergialainsäädäntö, jota sovelletaan nimenomaisesti myös fuusioreaktoreihin. Sääntely on kuitenkin edelleen laajasti fissioon keskittyvää. Tanskassa ja Norjassa taas toimitaan vanhemman sääntelyn mukaan, jossa fuusioenergiaa ei mainita erikseen. Tämä luo epävarmuutta menettelytapojen ja poliittisen päätöksenteon suhteen.

Fuusio voi olla lähempänä kuin uskotaan

Airilan mukaan tutkimuksen havainnot osoittavat, että Pohjoismaat ovat valmiita johtamaan fuusioenergian kehitystä eteenpäin.

”Kansallisten viranomaisten, teollisuuden ja paikallisten yhteisöjen tiiviillä yhteistyöllä ensimmäiset fuusioprojektit voivat toteutua nopeammin kuin moni odottaa”, Markus Airila sanoo.

”Vaikka kilpailukykyisen energiantuotannon saavuttaminen on edelleen suuri haaste, fuusiolaitos tuo ympärilleen paljon yhteiskunnallista hyötyä kuten asiantuntijoiden työpaikkoja ja kysyntää vaativalle teknologialle, jota voidaan siirtää muihinkin sovelluksiin. Jos fuusioteollisuuden kasvu maailmalla jatkuu ennustetusti, tästä syntyy erittäin merkittäviä vientimahdollisuuksia.”

Projektin seuraavassa vaiheessa tuotetaan yksityiskohtaiset ja paikkakohtaiset selvitykset laitoksesta kiinnostuneiden pohjoismaisten sidosryhmien ja teollisuuskumppanien kanssa. Tuolloin mahdollisia sijoituskohteita tarkennetaan maanomistuksen, paikallisen halukkuuden ja teknisen toteutettavuuden perusteella.

Energiayhtiö St1 ilmoitti keväällä 2025 sijoittaneensa 13 miljoonaa euroa Novatron Fusion Groupiin tukeakseen energiasiirtymää Pohjoismaissa.

”Novatron Fusion Group vauhdittaa puhtaan energian läpimurtoa, ja olemme ylpeitä voidessamme tukea tätä kehitystä pitkäjänteisesti.

Through SAF Circle, corporate and cargo flights operated by Iberia can use SAF certified under the European Renewable Energy Directive.
Companies participating in the program receive certification for their use of SAF, which can help improve their performance on environmental and sustainability measures.
SAF Circle offers an immediate solution for companies looking to reduce indirect emissions from business travel and cargo transport.
They added that SAF Circle fits within broader efforts, from digital innovation to circular economy practices, to take practical steps against climate change.","Iberia has launched SAF Circle, a new initiative aimed at helping companies reduce the environmental impact of their air travel. Supported by Amadeus, BBVA, Repsol, and Telefónica, the program allows businesses to link part of their Scope 3 emissions to the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), reports INSPENET.

The initiative was created to encourage companies to take an active role in reducing emissions in the aviation sector. Through SAF Circle, corporate and cargo flights operated by Iberia can use SAF certified under the European Renewable Energy Directive. Companies participating in the program receive certification for their use of SAF, which can help improve their performance on environmental and sustainability measures.

Companies are grouped into tiers, which come with rewards in Iberia’s loyalty program and access to better services. The program is designed to combine environmental responsibility with business benefits, giving companies an incentive to adopt cleaner fuels.

Some of the fuel used in the program comes from Repsol’s Cartagena plant, which can produce up to 250,000 tons of SAF per year. This supports Spain’s clean energy industry and positions SAF as a practical alternative to traditional kerosene.

SAF can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle, without requiring any changes to aircraft engines or airport infrastructure. SAF Circle offers an immediate solution for companies looking to reduce indirect emissions from business travel and cargo transport.

Executives from the participating companies said such partnerships are essential for moving toward cleaner energy.

Singapore aims to increase the use of SAF to more than 1% by 2026, with plans to raise it further to 3–5% by 2030. Authorities have said that the levy will not lead to a significant rise in airfares. The cost will be shared by all air transport users, with initial estimates suggesting a levy of S$3 (US$2.30) per passenger on an economy class direct flight, depending on distance.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could account for around 65% of the reductions needed for the aviation industry to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. However, global use of SAF remains very low, projected to make up only 0.7% of aviation fuel this year, while air travel is expected to grow by 6%, driving emissions higher.

Un progetto che consolida la leadership tecnologica italiana nel settore del Waste-to-Chemical e apre la strada al primo grande polo nordico dedicato al metanolo circolare.

Il cuore dell’iniziativa è la tecnologia NX Circular, sviluppata da MyRechemical, che consente di trasformare i rifiuti urbani e industriali in gas di sintesi di grado chimico, poi convertito in metanolo a ridotta impronta carbonica. Il processo si inserisce pienamente negli obiettivi europei di decarbonizzazione e nel quadro della Direttiva sulle Energie Rinnovabili (RED III), garantendo la produzione di un carburante conforme ai requisiti ambientali più stringenti.

Il metanolo prodotto potrà essere inizialmente utilizzato come combustibile marino, in linea con il regolamento FuelEU Maritime, consentendo agli operatori navali di ridurre drasticamente le emissioni ed evitare l’acquisto di crediti ETS o il pagamento di penali. A lungo termine, lo stesso metanolo circolare potrà diventare una materia prima strategica per la produzione di Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), in coerenza con il regolamento FuelEU Aviation, rafforzando così il contributo alla mobilità sostenibile del futuro.

In qualità di integratore tecnologico e fornitore di servizi, NextChem fornirà a Mana Group ed Equinor un’analisi dettagliata di fattibilità tecnica ed economica, che includerà la valutazione dei processi di gassificazione dei rifiuti e la purificazione del gas di sintesi necessario alla produzione di metanolo di alta qualità.

“Siamo orgogliosi di supportare questa partnership strategica, funzionale al potenziale sviluppo del primo grande progetto nordico di produzione di metanolo da rifiuti presso Mongstad, in Norvegia”, ha dichiarato Fabio Fritelli (nella foto), Managing Director di NextChem. “Il Nord Europa rappresenta un contesto ideale per progetti industriali replicabili e scalabili, con benefici ambientali e industriali tangibili”.

Yulianto menambahkan selain memenuhi standar kualitas BBM, operasional Kilang Cilacap sudah menerapkan standar keselamatan dan keamanan yang sangat tinggi.
“Kilang Cilacap merupakan kilang dengan hasil produk terbanyak dibandingkan kilang milik Pertamina lainnya, meliputi BBM Perta Series, solar, LPG, dan avtur konvensional maupun SAF,” ujar Wahyu.
KPI menargetkan pada tahun 2027, kandungan sulfur pada produk BBM yang dihasilkan kilang Pertamina akan terus dikurangi.
“Masih dalam tahapan perencanaan itu misalnya Diesel Hydrotreater, kemudian GSH, Gasoline Selected Hydrotreater,” tutur mantan GM Kilang Cilacap tersebut.","INDRAMAYU – PT KIlang Pertamina Internasional (KPI) memastikan kualitas produk bahan bakar minyak (BBM) yang diproduksi sudah diuji secara ketat agar memenuhi spesifikasi standar. Uji kualitas produk BBM dilakukan di semua kilang yang dimiliki KPI dengan menggunakan mesin CFR (Cooperative Fuel Research) yang merupakan alat standar internasional yang digunakan untuk menguji ketahanan bahan bakar terhadap knocking (detonasi), terutama untuk menentukan angka oktan (RON) dan angka setana (Cetane Number).

“Alat pengujian di seluruh kilang yang ada di dunia menggunakan CFR. Ini single brand yang dari Amerika Serikat. Seluruh kilang Pertamina memiliki alat ini sehingga produk yang telah lolos pengujian dipastikan telah memenuhi standar internasional. Semua produk BBM kami sebelum dipasarkan sudah melewati proses pengujian ini dan telah tersertifikasi,” tutur Yulianto Triwibowo, General Manager Pertamina RU VI Balongan, di Indramayu, pekan lalu.

Yulianto menambahkan selain memenuhi standar kualitas BBM, operasional Kilang Cilacap sudah menerapkan standar keselamatan dan keamanan yang sangat tinggi. Apalagi, kata dia, kilang-kilang Pertamina ini usianya sudah cukup tua. “Kami di Pertamina terus melakukan berbagai improvement untuk menjaga keandalan kilang. Semua itu kami lakukan agar Pertamina tetap menjadi kebanggaan Indonesia. Walaupun banyak tantangan, kami tetap bekerja dengan tenang dan fokus,” kata dia.

Manager Engineering & Development Kilang Balongan Hadi Siswanto menjelaskan Kilang Balongan memiliki kapasitas 150 ribu barel per hari (bph), atau sekitar 14,2% dari kapasitas total kilang milik Pertamina. Produk utama Kilang Cilacap adalah Bahan Bakar Khusus (BBK) seperti Pertamax, Pertamax Turbo, Avtur Pertadex sebanyak 52%, BBM (Premium dan Solar) 26%, Propylene dan LPG masing-masing 6%, produk aviation sebanyak 1%, dan sisanya produk lain-lain (HMOC, Decant Oil, LCO Mix, dan GO Foam) sebesar 9%.

“Sebanyak 82% produk Kilang Cilacap memenuhi kebutuhan di DKI dan Jawa Barat, 12% wilayah lain, dan sebanyak 6% di ekspor ke Singapura berupa Decant Oil,” kata Hadi.

Sementara itu, General Manager RU IV Kilang Cilacap Wahyu Sulistyo Wibowo mengatakan Kilang Cilacap memproduksi semua produk BBM, mulai dari Perta Series, solar, avtur dan yang terbaru adalah Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) atau bahan bakar pesawat terbang berbahan minyak jelantah. Wahyu menjelaskan, sebelum dilempar ke pasaran, produk-produk BBM tersebut diuji terlebih dahulu di laboratorium internal Kilang Cilacap. “Pengujian tersebut termasuk dalam menentukan Research Octane Number (RON) pada BBM. Pengujian dilakukan menggunakan mesin CFR,” katanya.

Dia menjelaskan mesin CFR bekerja dengan mensimulasikan kondisi pembakaran di dalam mesin kendaraan, termasuk tekanan, suhu dan rasio kompresi yang dikontrol secara ketat, sehingga hasilnya dapat digunakan untuk memastikan kualitas bahan bakar sesuai standar,” ujar Wahyu, akhir pekan.

Menurut Wahyu, semua produk yang diuji dalam laboratorium dipastikan dengan kualitas baik, bahkan bisa melebihi spesifikasi standar. Misalnya, untuk BBM jenis Pertalite dengan RON 90, dalam pengujian di laboratorium hasil RON yang muncul di alat bisa 90,1 atau 90,2. “Jika angka yang muncul di bawah standar yang ditentukan, maka pengujian dilakukan lagi dari awal, hingga hasilnya sesuai. Kami tidak pernah menjual BBM ke masyarakat dengan spesifikasi lebih rendah dari yang ditentukan,” ungkap Wahyu.

Dengan begitu, ia meminta masyarakat tidak perlu khawatir dengan kualitas BBM yang diproduksi oleh KPI. Wahyu menjelaskan semua produk BBM tersebut telah diolah dengan pengawasan ketat, untuk memastikan kualitasnya paripurna sebelum didistribusikan. “Semua produk yang kami hasilkan terjamin kualitasnya, sesuai dengan spesifikasi yang ditentukan sehingga aman untuk digunakan masyarakat,” tandas Wahyu.

Selain pengujian di laboratorium internal, BBM yang diproduksi oleh KPI juga diuji dilaboratorium eksternal, sebagai bentuk pengendalian mutu yang berkelanjutan. Salah satunya, pengujian dilakukan di Balai Besar Pengujian Minyak dan Gas Bumi (BBPMGB) LEMIGAS yang merupakan laboratorium independen, pada periode Agustus-September lalu.

Wahyu mengatakan, hasil pengujian tersebut menunjukkan kalau semua produk BBM olahan KPI memenuhi spesifikasi yang telar disyaratkan dalam Keputusan Direktur Jenderal Minyak dan Gas Bumi, Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM). Adapun produk yang diuji di LEMIGAS diantaranya BBM jenis Pertalite, Pertamax, Pertamax Turbo, Pertadex, Biosolar dan Avtur atau bahan bakar pesawat terbang. “Hasil pengujian ini membuktikan kalau proses pengolahan di KPI tetap optimal dan menghasilkan produk energi yang sesuai dengan standar nasional,” kata dia.

Kilang Cilacap memiliki total kapasitas pengolahan 348 ribu bph yang terdiri dari dua Crude Distillation Unit (CDU). CDU-1 sudah beroperasi sejak 1976 berkapasitas 100 ribu bph dan CDU-2 beroperasi pada 1984 dengan kapasitas 200 ribu bph.

Pada tahun 1997, Kilang Cilacap melakukan revamping atau pengembangan, menambah kapasitas CDU-1 menjdi 118 ribu bph, dan CDU-2 menjadi 230 ribu bph. Dengan begitu, total kapasitas Kilang Cilacap menjadi 348 ribu bph. “Saat ini merupakan kilang terbesar milik Pertamina. Nanti, mungkin kedua setelah Proyek RDMP Balikpapan selesai dan diintegrasikan dengan kilang eksisting dengan kapasitas 360 ribu bph,” ungkapnya.

Selain itu, Kilang Cilacap memiliki Residual Fluid Catalytic Cracking (RFCC) mulai 2015 dengan kapasitas 62 ribu bph. Unit ini didesain untuk mengolah residu menjadi produk dengan nilai ekonomi tinggi seperti LPG, Propylene, Polygasoline (mogas dengan RON 98), Naptha (RON 92), Light Sycle Oil (LCO) danDecant Oil (DCO).

Sementara produk bahan bakar hijau (biofuel) diproduksi melalui Unit Treated Distillate Hydro Treating (TDHT). Pengolahan dilakukan secara co-processing antara Refined Bleached Deodorized Palm Oil (RBDPO), Refined, Bleached, and Deodorized Palm Kernel Oil (RBDPKO), maupun minyak jelantah (UCO). “Kilang Cilacap merupakan kilang dengan hasil produk terbanyak dibandingkan kilang milik Pertamina lainnya, meliputi BBM Perta Series, solar, LPG, dan avtur konvensional maupun SAF,” ujar Wahyu.

Kurangi Kandungan Sulfur

KPI menargetkan pengurangan kandungan sulfur pada produksi BBM. VP Process & Facility KPI, Edy Januari Utama, mengatakan peta jalan pengembangan kilang akan dilakukan dengan beberapa kategori. Pertama yakni memenuhi batasan spesifikasi, salah satunya kandungan sulfur. Dia mencontohkan, kadar sulfur pada produk Diesel awalnya sebesar 3.500 part per million (ppm), kemudian dikurangi menjadi 2.500 dan 2.000 ppm pada produk Biosolar. “Kadar sulfurnya selalu dikurangi menjadi lebih baik lagi,” katanya.

KPI menargetkan pada tahun 2027, kandungan sulfur pada produk BBM yang dihasilkan kilang Pertamina akan terus dikurangi. “Untuk itu aka nada beberapa proyek yang sudah disiapkan,” tuturnya.

Pertamina baru saja meluncurkan produk Diesel X melalui unit Gas Oil Hydrotreater di Kilang Balongan. Edy mengungkapkan, perusahaan tengah merencanakan unit yang sama untuk produk Gasoline alias bensin. “Masih dalam tahapan perencanaan itu misalnya Diesel Hydrotreater, kemudian GSH, Gasoline Selected Hydrotreater,” tutur mantan GM Kilang Cilacap tersebut.(LH)",https://www.dunia-energi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CML2629.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 07:22:48.110163

Addressing AASA’s 55th Annual General Assembly (AGA) in Lusaka, Zambia, Munetsi said for too long, African aviation has been underestimated — especially by Africans.
On supply chain, he noted that the global shortage of air- craft and parts has severely affected African airlines.
Manufacturers quote up to six-year delivery lead-times, which requires older, less efficient aircraft to be kept in service for longer.
Only by working together can we ensure Africa’s aviation sector finally takes off and becomes far more than a twoper cent player in the global market,” he concluded.","…excessive taxes, charges make travel expensive

The Chief Executive Officer of Airlines Association of Southern Africa (AASA), Aaron Munetsi, said airlines, airports, air navigation services, regulators and equipment suppliers all had a part to play in rewriting Africa’s aviation negative narrative and demonstrating that African carriers can hold their own globally.

This is coming as he lamented that Africa’s carriers face more than $220 million in additional supply chain-related costs this year alone, with a call that if governments genuinely want to democratise air transport, they should remove excessive statutory charges and taxes that have driven up costs, made ticket prices higher and pushed air transport beyond the reach of most Africans.

Addressing AASA’s 55th Annual General Assembly (AGA) in Lusaka, Zambia, Munetsi said for too long, African aviation has been underestimated — especially by Africans. He further noted that Africa is home to 1.4 billion people, the world’s youngest population and a growing middle class, but with just 2.2 per cent of the global air transport market share, “we are still idling on the run- way”.

The group called for a bold, collective effort to democratise and liberate the continent’s aviation sector through a series of interventions, including harmonising regulations, opening markets to competition, stabilising the industry supply chain, financial discipline, governance as well as fixing critical aviation infrastructure and related services.

Restoring confidence in Africa’s Skies, Munetsi out- lined AASA’s multi-pronged strategy for boosting Africa’s air transport sector, such as safety and standards, adding that Africa must harmonise oversight and recognise mutual licensing and certification — as the EU did in the 1990s — to support SAATM implementation and improve efficiency.

On supply chain, he noted that the global shortage of air- craft and parts has severely affected African airlines. Manufacturers quote up to six-year delivery lead-times, which requires older, less efficient aircraft to be kept in service for longer.

For financial sustainability, he called on state-owned airlines to be run with accountability, cost discipline, innovation and partnerships to drive better financial performance.

Munetsi stated that despite Africa’s small 2% share of global aviation emissions, governments should be facilitating investments in locally produced sustainable aviation fuel while their aviation infrastructure services should be improving operational procedures to help airlines reduce fuel burn and carbon emissions.

To him, empowering Africa’s youth, women, and innovators is key and requires investments in training, mentorship and inclusion, reiterating that in tandem, archaic protectionist practices and processes that restrict growth had to be stopped with governments rolling back excessive taxes and charges on air transport.

Munetsi raised concerns about operational inefficiencies and safety failures in South Africa, citing the on- going suspension of over 200 instrument flight procedures by Air Traffic and Navigation Services (ATNS), which continues to disrupt airline operations and cost airlines millions of dollars in additional fuel, engine wear and maintenance, crew flight duty, flight operations sup- port, customer compensation and reputational damage.

AASA is worried that the glacial pace at which air- space management failures are being addressed meant the scale of the economic impact is not fully grasped. “The failure to design, manage and maintain air- space cannot be dismissed as an ‘inconvenience’.

It needs to be seen for what it is; an economic disaster which demands a commensurate emergency disaster response. The lack of urgency is reflected in the glacial pace at which approval renewals were being processed,” he emphasised.

AASA also called on governments to invest in digital border and customs systems and to relax restrictive visa regimes that deter travel. It also wants to see Mozambique and other governments with foreign reserves release airlines’ blocked funds and let local airlines access foreign currency to purchase aircraft spare parts and cover other dollar-priced costs.

“African aviation’s success depends on collaboration and shared responsibility. It’s time to stop talking and start improving. Only by working together can we ensure Africa’s aviation sector finally takes off and becomes far more than a twoper cent player in the global market,” he concluded.",https://newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BUSINESS-NEWS.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 07:23:01.042313

""Secara teknis, SAF mampu menurunkan emisi karbon hingga 80% dibandingkan bahan bakar fosil, menjadikannya langkah signifikan menuju penerbangan rendah emisi,"" ujar Ridlo, Senin (20/10).

Seluruh pesawat Airbus, sambung Ridlo, mampu terbang dengan campuran SAF sebanyak 50%. Ke depan, tepatnya pada 2030, Airbus Indonesia berharap penggunaan SAF bisa mencapai 100% pada seluruh pesawat Airbus.

""Kami percaya dengan kolaborasi erat antara produsen bahan bakar, produsen pesawat, regulator & pembuat kebijakan, serta operator maskapai, SAF dapat menjadi standar baru penerbangan global,"" kata dia.

Bukan hanya Airbus Indonesia, PT Garuda Indonesia juga menjadi salah satu maskapai yang sudah menggunakan SAF pada penerbangan reguler.

Caretaker Corporate Sustainability Group Head Garuda Indonesia Heri Martanto menerangkan pihaknya sudah menggunakan SAF untuk penerbangan internasional rute Amsterdam-Jakarta beberapa waktu lalu.
