As part of its wider expansion strategy, the airline is also bolstering its engine capacity with an additional 40 Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines. These landmark agreements mark a significant step in Vietjet’s growth strategy as a multi-national aviation group, while also strengthening economic ties between Vietnam, France, and Europe.

The latest order builds on Vietjet’s commitment last month for 20 additional A330neo aircraft, bringing its total widebody aircraft on order to 40.

Vietjet Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao said: “I have a vision and the determination to make Vietnam a regional aviation hub for passenger transportation, technical services, logistics, training, research, global supply chains, and aviation infrastructure. We will continue to develop a robust and modern fleet to support that goal. Today’s agreement with Airbus is more than a commercial contract — it is a significant milestone that marks the beginning of Vietjet’s new journey: a journey of global expansion, new growth drivers, enhanced connectivity, and the development of a sustainable aviation ecosystem powered by ambition and transformation.”

Airbus EVP Sales of the Commercial Aircraft business Benoît de Saint-Exupéry said: “Our latest agreement comes just weeks after the airline placed an additional order for A330neo widebody aircraft. Together, the A321neo and A330neo will be perfect partners for Vietjet to continue to spread its wings, efficiently matching capacity more closely to demand across its network.”

The A321neo is the largest member of Airbus’ best-selling A320neo Family, offering exceptional range and performance. Equipped with new generation engines and Sharklets, the A321neo brings a 50% noise reduction and more than 20% fuel savings and CO₂ reduction compared to previous generation single-aisle aircraft while maximising passenger comfort in the widest single-aisle cabin in the sky.

As with all in-production aircraft, the A321neo can operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with a target to increase to up to 100% SAF capability by 2030.

Vietjet also placed an order for 40 additional Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines. The deal reinforces Vietjet’s commitment to building a next-generation widebody fleet, doubling its total order to 80 following an initial agreement at the 2024 Singapore Airshow.

And thirdly, we seek to provide tools and practical measures to support the industry in attaining its sustainability goals.” His one ask to regulators attending the Hong Kong summit?","Airfreight is navigating a year of intense disruption. With trade protectionism, regional conflicts, and fragile consumer sentiment shaping global flows, 2025 demands more than incremental thinking. TIACA’s choice to host its Executive Summit in Hong Kong sends a clear message about where the industry’s centre of gravity is shifting—and where the hard conversations need to happen.

Asia in focus

“We wanted the 2025 Summit to be in Asia as part of the TIACA board’s objective of ensuring our events are held in areas which ensure member accessibility, as well as being in locations which play a crucial role within the global airfreight industry,” said Glyn Hughes, TIACA’s director general. “Hong Kong fits these requirements perfectly, particularly when it comes to being the e-commerce gateway to the world. China accounts for 27 percent of global manufacturing output, and with ‘China plus one’ policies expected to lead to a greater amount of production elsewhere in Asia, it certainly illustrates that the region will be a crucial component of future airfreight industry success.”

The choice is strategic, not symbolic. In an era where logistics resilience and regional diversification are paramount, Hong Kong serves as a real-time laboratory for change. Hughes is clear that the summit is not a networking formality but a focused industry checkpoint.

“We build our agenda around the topics of most relevance to the entire community, so we will focus on e-commerce, digitalisation, airport development, AI, innovation, sustainability, industry trends, and the overall outlook,” he said. “We will have two industry leaders’ roundtable discussions, and as part of TIACA’s commitment to showcase leadership, we will have the finals of our Sustainability Awards, our 2025 Hall of Fame induction ceremony, and two new awards recognising inspirational leadership and a rising star of tomorrow.”

BlueSky: More than a dashboard

A cornerstone of that accountability is TIACA’s BlueSky programme, designed to benchmark and validate companies’ sustainability progress across a wide range of metrics. Yet industry adoption hasn’t been as widespread as expected.

“I have been a little surprised that more companies haven’t signed up for the BlueSky programme, as the feedback we receive from those who have gone through the programme is excellent,” Hughes said. “Not only does it provide a personalised dashboard reflecting how the company is performing across a range of sustainability topics, it also illustrates where they need to focus on going forward.”

The programme’s structure encourages internal reflection, but also collaborative action. “We have just completed the first BlueSky community, led by Air Cargo Belgium and Brussels Airport, which took a group of six leading companies through the programme together. In addition to individual company results, we were also able to highlight areas that were common to many, and this additional guidance will be used by Air Cargo Belgium to provide some new programmes for their members.”

Decarbonisation at a crossroads

When asked whether the sector is progressing fast enough on environmental goals, Hughes didn’t dodge the complexity.

“Overall, I think the airfreight industry is performing well across a number of sustainability topics, although there are a few areas where more needs to be done,” he said. “Reduced waste, including reduction of single-use plastic, is one very positive result of actions taken. Airlines are investing heavily in newer-generation, more fuel-efficient fleets, and forwarders and trucking companies are increasing the number of EVs in their ground fleets. Ground handlers are electrifying GSE, and some are even investigating the use of green hydrogen-based equipment.”

But he cautioned that decarbonisation hinges on more than industry alone. “Airfreight shippers are leading when it comes to committing to purchase sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), but overall there is a lack of SAF available in the market. Therefore, in order to meet the 2025 net zero target, it is crucial that fuel producers, governments, and the investment community look at how they can increase production capability.”

TIACA’s role: Measuring success

TIACA’s position, Hughes emphasised, is not just to observe industry progress but to facilitate it.

“We see the role of TIACA as threefold in this regard,” he said. “Firstly, we seek to work with legislators to help educate them on what the industry is doing and whether proposed changes to legislative requirements are workable. Next, we aim to help educate the industry as to what the regulatory requirements are. And thirdly, we seek to provide tools and practical measures to support the industry in attaining its sustainability goals.”

His one ask to regulators attending the Hong Kong summit? “That they consider incentive programmes to support the investments that are required to address decarbonisation strategies.”

What does success look like for TIACA by the end of 2025? It’s not headline numbers, but relevance.

“For TIACA it’s all about member satisfaction,” Hughes said. “We undertake an annual member survey and adjust our programmes thereafter to ensure we deliver what our members look for from their association.”",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/page-4-23--1080x660.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 20:00:56.727002

The milestone was celebrated during a site visit attended by Khaled Abbas, Chairperson of the Administrative Capital for Urban Development (ACUD), and Ahmed Fahmy, ACUD’s General Manager.

Abbas praised the high standards of execution and design at Midtown Solo, describing it as a reflection of the premium quality envisioned for the New Capital. He reaffirmed ACUD’s ongoing commitment to supporting serious developers and accelerating progress on this national megaproject, which stands as a pillar of Egypt’s “New Republic” vision.

Midtown Solo features fully serviced standalone villas, targeting a high-end clientele. Abbas confirmed that 95% of infrastructure works for the project’s first phase have been completed, with final utility connections pending developer compliance with technical specifications. He also noted that landscaping and main roadworks across the R7 district are progressing in phases and will be completed soon.

Fahmy highlighted that Midtown Solo is Better Home’s second project to be delivered in the New Capital, and lauded its architectural quality and integrated services. He stressed that such developments are key to drawing more residents and investors to the city.

To further support developers, Fahmy revealed that ACUD has introduced 4 to 5 facilitation packages, helping struggling companies resolve issues and expedite license issuance. He also acknowledged Better Home’s early and continued investment in the Capital, noting the company’s pivotal role in believing in the city’s long-term potential.

He added that investor interest remains strong, citing a recent electronic land offering in the R8 district that drew three times the available applications.

Ashraf Adel, General Manager of Better Home, emphasized the company’s pioneering role as the first private real estate developer to acquire land in the New Capital. He described Midtown Solo as a landmark development, and the only project in the Capital comprised entirely of standalone villas—390 in total—spanning 66 acres along the prominent South Bin Zayed Axis, near the Cathedral and Green River.

Adel highlighted the project’s low-density design, with 80% of the land devoted to greenery, landscaping, and lagoons, and only 20% for built structures—creating a tranquil and healthy living environment. Residents benefit from a full suite of amenities, including a clubhouse, swimming pools, restaurants, cafés, and pharmacies.

The development sold out in record time, reflecting strong market confidence in the Better Home brand. It also features a 30,000 sqm commercial hub made up of 14 standalone buildings (ground + 2 floors + rooftop + private basement). Each unit starts at 1,250 sqm, with 1,100 sqm of outdoor space and a 940 sqm basement, designed to serve both residents and the broader community.",https://images.dailynewsegypt.com/2025/06/2703548_0.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 20:01:01.264848

This months-long investigation with co-partner Climate Home News focused on a key ingredient vital to making SAF: used cooking oil. Most people probably don't know that their cooking oil used for frying can be turned into jet fuel. Millions of tonnes are collected globally and it is turned into SAF and biodiesel. It's a wonder of modern chemistry. Repurposing used cooking oil, that would otherwise be tossed away, is a great recycling story and it also means less pressure on agricultural land and deforestation. But there's a dark side to this story: greed. The demand for SAF is growing because more and more governments are setting strict useage mandates at airports ( 2 pct SAF use at EU airports, which will rise to 6 pct by 2030). Because there is such demand, that means UCO demand is also growing fast. Our investigation into the trade of UCO between Malaysia and Spain shows there are significant opportunities for fraud: the mixing of virgin palm oil into UCO and adding barely used (fried once) cooking oil into UCO supplies. This can be lucrative for UCO traders and hard to catch by auditors. This illicit ""fattening up"" of UCO supplies risks undermining the whole sustainability credentials, and benefits, of SAF, a fuel that the industry can achieve deep emissions cuts over fossil fuel-derived aviation fuel. It is also a headache for the sustainability certification schemes, for refiners and for airlines, including #Singapore, which is emerging as a global hub for SAF production and use. And it's a headache for the EU, which bans the use of virgin palm oil or any feedstock that could be linked to the risk of deforestation, or labour abuses.

Vinod Khosla rides to LanzaTech’s rescue

ANALYSIS: After a US$40m capital injection, the Kiwi-founded carbon recycling company needs shareholder approval to raise more funds.

Illustration: Michael Hickmott

Key points

What's at stake: Kiwi-founded and US-based carbon recycling company LanzaTech needs shareholder approval for a rescue deal from US billionaire Vinod Khosla and his associated funds to get on a more even financial keel.

Background: LanzaTech's share price has dropped below the level where it can remain Nasdaq-listed unless it does a stock split following falling revenue, widening losses, and concerted shareholder pressure to become profitable. The deal will give Khosla control of the company again.

Main players: LanzaTech, Khosla Ventures, Guardians of NZ Superannuation, Carbon Direct Capital Management.

LanzaTech shareholders appear to have little choice other than to vote in favour at its upcoming annual general meeting of what amounts to a rescue deal from US venture capital firm Khosla Ventures.

This expansion aligns with the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 goals of boosting tourism and international connectivity while offering travelers increased access to one of the region’s most dynamic economies. By enhancing its travel network and leveraging codeshare partnerships, Air France aims to capture a larger share of both business and leisure travel, while promoting its hallmark French service and sustainability initiatives.

Air France Expands Gulf Operations with Ambitious Paris–Riyadh Daily Flight Plan Aligned to Saudi Market Growth

Air France is strengthening its footprint in the Middle East with the announcement of its planned daily service between Paris and Riyadh, signaling a new chapter in the airline’s regional expansion. This move comes shortly after the successful launch of its first direct connection between Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport and Riyadh’s King Khalid International Airport. The planned frequency increase reflects rising demand and reinforces Air France’s strategic interest in Saudi Arabia, a market witnessing dynamic transformation under its Vision 2030 blueprint.

A Renewed Commitment to the Saudi Market

The launch of this direct service underscores Air France’s determination to reassert its presence in the Kingdom. The airline views Saudi Arabia not only as a fast-emerging tourism and investment hub but also as a vital link in its global route network. According to senior airline executives, this expansion is a response to a significant increase in passenger demand—both from tourists and business travelers seeking easier access to the Kingdom’s evolving economy.

Saudi Arabia has been actively working to boost international connectivity as it diversifies away from oil dependency and attracts global businesses, tourists, and investors. Air France’s decision to operate daily flights comes as a strategic response to this surge in international interest.

Strategic Growth and Network Connectivity

Air France’s ambitions in the region are not limited to frequency increases. The carrier is actively forging new partnerships and reinforcing its regional network through codeshare agreements, particularly with local Gulf carriers. These collaborations are enabling Air France to offer seamless travel options to passengers flying beyond Riyadh to other cities within Saudi Arabia and across the broader Gulf region.

The expanded connectivity strengthens Air France’s overall offering, making it more competitive and accessible for global travelers wishing to fly into Saudi Arabia via Europe. The Paris–Riyadh link is expected to serve as a critical artery for trade, tourism, and diplomacy, enhancing cross-cultural exchange and business cooperation.

Leveraging the Allure of French Excellence

Air France is not only banking on convenience and strategic location—it is also leveraging its French heritage to appeal to discerning global travelers. The airline continues to promote its signature in-flight French culinary experience, luxury service, and refined aesthetics. These elements remain central to the Air France brand and play a key role in differentiating the airline in a competitive global market.

This emphasis on French elegance is particularly well-received in markets like the Middle East, where there is a strong appreciation for high-end service and unique travel experiences. From carefully curated menus featuring French cuisine to cabin interiors inspired by Parisian design, the airline offers a taste of France at 35,000 feet.

A Focus on Sustainable Growth

Air France is not just expanding routes—it is also prioritizing sustainability as a core component of its growth strategy. The airline continues to lead the aviation industry in the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), holding the distinction of being the world’s largest buyer of SAF among commercial airlines.

As part of its long-term decarbonization goals, the airline is incorporating new-generation aircraft that consume less fuel and emit fewer carbon emissions. The Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner, both known for their operational efficiency and environmental advantages, are being increasingly integrated into Air France’s long-haul fleet.

Additionally, the airline’s sustainability efforts extend beyond fuel efficiency. Air France has implemented a series of operational changes, such as weight reduction initiatives, more direct routing for shorter flights, and waste reduction strategies onboard, all contributing to its ambitious environmental roadmap.

Technology-Driven Passenger Experience

Enhancing customer satisfaction remains a top priority for Air France. The airline is investing heavily in digital transformation to improve the travel experience from booking to baggage claim. Innovations such as AI-powered check-in kiosks, upgraded in-flight entertainment systems, and personalized services are being gradually rolled out across the airline’s long-haul network.

Frequent flyers can expect a more intuitive and streamlined journey, while occasional travelers benefit from a more customized and responsive service environment. This tech-forward approach is intended to meet the evolving expectations of a digitally-savvy passenger base, particularly in business and premium classes.

A Future-Focused Partnership with Saudi Arabia

Air France’s growing involvement in the Saudi market aligns with the Kingdom’s efforts to position itself as a global tourism and business destination. With mega-projects like NEOM, the Red Sea development, and Diriyah Gate driving tourism and investment interest, connectivity between Europe and Saudi Arabia has never been more important.

By scaling up its service to Riyadh, Air France is not only enhancing its own commercial prospects but also playing a vital role in facilitating Saudi Arabia’s ambitious transformation goals. The airline is expected to contribute significantly to inbound tourism from Europe while also providing Saudi travelers with greater access to global destinations via its Paris hub.

Conclusion

The planned daily Air France flights between Paris and Riyadh represent more than just a route expansion—they symbolize a broader commitment to fostering global connectivity, cultural exchange, and sustainable aviation. As Saudi Arabia continues its journey of rapid economic development, Air France is positioning itself as a key enabler, offering premium service, environmental leadership, and seamless travel options that support the region’s long-term aspirations.

Air France is launching daily flights between Paris and Riyadh to meet rising travel demand and strengthen its role in Saudi Arabia’s rapidly expanding aviation and tourism market. This move supports the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 and reinforces Air France’s Gulf expansion strategy.

With a renewed focus on strategic growth, deepened regional partnerships, and a dedication to sustainable practices, Air France is charting a clear course toward a more connected and environmentally responsible future—one flight at a time.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/freepik__the-style-is-candid-ima-100-3.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 14:02:12.241853

All the new rakes that are being introduced in the city's rapid transit system feature ‘Regenerative Braking', he said.

“The technology allows a train's electric motors to operate in reverse (like a generator) during braking, leading to conversion of the train's kinetic energy back into electrical energy, rather than wasting it in the form of heating of wheels or brake shoes,” a Metro Railway Kolkata spokesperson said.

At present, the Kolkata metro railway operates 37 rakes with regenerative braking features.

“The total energy regenerated in the year 2024-25 – by usage of the system in 37 rakes – has been 1.08 crore units, which have saved around Rs 8.2 crore in energy cost,” he said.

Regenerative braking has reduced carbon emissions by 13,500 tonnes in the previous financial year, the official said.

In a study conducted by Metro Railway Kolkata, it has been observed that 17-20 per cent regeneration of electricity is possible, he said.

“This is a step forward for saving energy and reducing the use of fossil fuel. Urban metro systems like those in London, Tokyo and New York also use regenerative braking,” the spokesperson said.

“The unique advanced 'Regenerative Braking System' technology reduces wear and tear of brake, wheel, brake disc as well as maintenance costs,” he said.

In another green initiative, Metro Railway Kolkata has taken up the work of setting up a 4-MW ‘Advanced Chemical Cell (ACC)' battery storage system, “which is the first of its kind in Indian Railways”.

The batteries have arrived and the system is expected to be operational in the middle of July, 2025, he added.

The announcement follows the launch of the carrier’s first direct route between Paris-Charles de Gaulle and King Khalid International Airport.

Stefan Gumuseli, the airline’s general manager for India and the Middle East, outlined the importance of the new route for the Air France-KLM Group and said it reflects the airline’s ambition to reestablish its presence in the Saudi market.

The decision comes in response to growing demand from travelers and investors eager to access the Kingdom’s expanding economic opportunities.

The new route marks a strategic step for Air France as it expands operations in the region and aligns with the growing connectivity between Europe and Saudi Arabia.

Talking to Arab News, Gumuseli said: “We’re starting with three weekly flights in mid-June, then gradually increasing to five. Our first major goal is to move to a daily service.”

He added that the market is not only outward-looking; the airline is also responding to rising inbound demand for Saudi Arabia, noting that it is experiencing almost exponential year-on-year growth.

Gumuseli also pointed to the Kingdom’s Vision 2030, which reflects a strong commitment to developing tourism, hospitality, and culture, supported by substantial ongoing investments. He said: “All these megaprojects are a clear sign that tourism is booming. We have a strong relationship with Saudi Arabia and are expanding our cooperation.”

His comments were echoed by Air France’s Senior Vice President for Benelux, Asia, India, the Middle East, and East Africa Bas Gerressen, who told Arab News: “Tourism is a very important factor, but we also need traffic, which has grown significantly over the past two years.

“The more connectivity there is between the two countries, the more economic exchange will flourish in both directions,” Gerressen added.

Air France-KLM has entered into codeshare agreements to strengthen its network connectivity.

“We also place our code on these flights. So, when you consider all that connectivity from both sides, demand can only grow,” Gerressen said.

He added: “I believe Saudi Arabia has many premium travelers, and we need to reach them in specific markets. We already have strong demand across our business, premium and economy classes.”

At the same time, the airline is leveraging its distinctive French identity.

‘We position ourselves as a truly French brand — luxury, elegance, sophistication ... The French Touch. You can feel it the moment you board,” said Gerressen.

High-end products, gourmet in-flight dining, La Premiere lounges, and exclusive cabin experiences all reinforce this premium positioning. “We offer one of the best cabins in the region with our new first class, featuring a seat with five windows and just four seats in the entire cabin. It’s a revolution in the industry,” Gerressen added.

He emphasized the cabin crew’s vital role in shaping the passenger experience, highlighting their attentiveness and approachable demeanor.

As part of its sustainability strategy, Air France is adopting a comprehensive approach across its operations.

“Each new generation of aircraft reduces CO₂ emissions by up to 25 percent. Today, 28 percent of our fleet consists of these new aircraft, and our goal is to increase this figure to 80 percent by 2030,” Gerressen said.

The airline is also the world’s leading buyer of sustainable aviation fuel.

Gumuseli said: “We account for nearly 16 percent of global SAF usage, despite representing only 3 percent of total global kerosene consumption.”

Air France is investing in technology to enhance the passenger experience.

“We’ve decided to install high-speed Wi-Fi on board. In the event of a delay, passengers will receive updates about their connecting flights directly on their screens. With data and technology, we can truly personalize the service,” Gumuseli said.

“Our target customers include expatriates living in Saudi Arabia and tourists wishing to travel to Europe, North America, South America or Africa. Businesses are also a key audience, given the strong commercial ties between France and Saudi Arabia. We aim to serve all these segments,” said Gumuseli.

“Religious tourism should not be overlooked. Pilgrims can now combine Umrah with a more tourist-oriented experience,” he added.

Gerressen stressed the importance of the eVisa: “It is crucial. Simplifying the visa process will be essential in convincing more people to visit Saudi Arabia.”

JEDDAH: Saudi Arabia plans to raise the cultural sector’s contribution to gross domestic product to 3 percent — or SR180 billion ($48 billion) — by 2030, up from under 1 percent, according to Minister of Culture Prince Badr bin Abdullah bin Farhan.

In an interview with Al-Eqtisadiah, the minister said the sector has already surpassed its previous 0.91 percent GDP share, with Vision 2030 targets being met ahead of schedule.

“Vision 2030 forms the foundation of the Ministry of Culture’s strategy and direction,” he said.

“By 2030, we envision a cultural environment that nurtures talent, encourages innovation both locally and internationally, and supports the flourishing of creative and cultural enterprises.” Prince Badr said in the interview.

“Ultimately, our goal is to increase the sector’s contribution to GDP to 3 percent, equivalent to SR180 billion,” he said. “This represents the core mission of the Ministry of Culture and its affiliated bodies in driving an ambitious cultural transformation.”

Since the ministry’s founding in 2018, employment in the sector has jumped 318 percent, while the number of cultural graduates reached 28,800 in 2024, up 79 percent from 2018. The ministry has also issued over 9,000 licenses, while cultural associations and amateur clubs surged from 28 to 993.

“One notable outcome is the increase in the percentage of citizens who believe culture is important—from under 70 percent to 92 percent,” Prince Badr said. The ministry also oversees national celebrations such as Founding Day and Flag Day and has documented 9,317 antiquities sites and 25,000 urban heritage locations.

Saudi Arabia has now met its Vision 2030 target of having eight UNESCO World Heritage sites, with Al-Faw joining the list in 2024. Cultural event attendance exceeded 23.5 million between 2021 and 2024, and major festivals such as the Red Sea Film Festival and Islamic Arts Biennale have become global draws.

The Cultural Scholarship Program has awarded scholarships to 1,222 students studying at over 120 institutions across countries, including the US, the UK, and France. The program’s flexible design — no age limit or required academic background — has broadened participation. “Today, scholarship recipients are pursuing degrees in fields such as music, theater, and visual arts,” the minister said.

Through the Cultural Development Fund, the ministry has disbursed SR377 million to more than 120 projects. “Key areas of growth include heritage, music, and fashion. More than 1,200 creatives and entrepreneurs have benefited from its development services,” he added.

“Globally, there is increasing recognition of culture’s role in sustainable economic value creation,” the minister said. “Our role is to preserve and promote cultural identity while making it accessible and economically valuable.”

RIYADH: Saudi Arabia welcomed 116 million tourists in 2024, exceeding its annual visitor target for the second year in a row, the official data showed.

According to the Ministry of Tourism’s latest annual statistical report, the figure includes 29.7 million inbound tourists, an 8 percent increase year on year, and 86.2 million domestic trips, up 5 percent from 2023.

The milestone reflects the continued acceleration of the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 strategy, which positions tourism as a central driver of economic diversification.

After surpassing its original 100 million visitor goal six years ahead of schedule in 2023, Saudi Arabia has revised its ambitions upward, now aiming to attract 150 million tourists annually by 2030. This figure is split between 70 million international and 80 million domestic visitors.

In a post on X, Minister of Tourism Ahmed Al-Khateeb said: “The 2024 Annual Statistical Report showcases the sector’s remarkable growth and its role in enabling Saudi Vision2030, a record performance achieved with the support and guidance of the Kingdom’s visionary leadership.”

Total tourism spending in 2024 hit SR283.8 billion ($75.6 billion), with inbound tourists contributing SR168.5 billion, up 19 percent from 2023, while domestic tourist expenditure reached SR115.3 billion, a 1 percent rise.

“The tourism sector continued to achieve record growth, reaffirming its transformation into a key driver of economic development and a fundamental pillar in advancing and diversifying the national economy,” the minister said.

Inbound tourism also reached a record monthly peak in March with 3.2 million visitors. The average international tourist stayed 19 nights and spent SR5,669 per trip.

A standout development in 2024 was the continued rise in non-religious tourism, now representing 59 percent of inbound visits compared to 44 percent in 2019.

Leisure and holiday travel topped this category, with related spending reaching SR36.4 billion.

Makkah remained the top destination, drawing 17.4 million overnight visitors, and Egypt was the leading source market with 3.2 million arrivals.

Regional analysis revealed that Asia and the Pacific accounted for the largest share of inbound tourists, at 33 percent, followed by the Middle East and North Africa at 28 percent, and the Gulf Cooperation Council at 27 percent.

Europe contributed 8 percent, while both the Americas and Africa each made up 2 percent of total visitors.

The sustained growth reflects the Kingdom’s continued focus on developing its tourism infrastructure and global outreach.

The ministry noted that this report highlights the exceptional and accelerated growth achieved by the sector through targeted marketing campaigns and support programs, contributing to the sector’s record-breaking performance.

RIYADH: Oman’s insured non-oil exports reached 61.2 million Omani rials ($159 million) in the first quarter of 2025, marking a 6 percent increase from the same period last year, according to Credit Oman.

The sultanate’s export credit agency, which provides trade insurance and guarantees to support domestic and international exchange, cited growth in construction materials, petrochemicals, mining, and agriculture as key drivers, the Oman News Agency reported.

This comes as Oman’s broader non-oil exports grew 8.6 percent year on year to 1.61 billion rials, now making up 28.6 percent of total exports. The growth reflects ongoing efforts to boost non-oil trade, support domestic industries, attract foreign investment, localize development initiatives, and offer incentives to the private sector.

The ONA report stated: “Khalil bin Ahmed Al Harthy, CEO of Credit Oman, explained that the volume of insured export sales in the building and construction materials sector witnessed a growth of 24 percent, with a total value of 27.16 million rials.”

Exports in the petrochemicals and plastics sector climbed 45 percent to 9.2 million riyals.

The mining sector experienced the largest percentage growth, jumping 150 percent to 570,000 rials. Meanwhile, agricultural exports surged 96 percent to nearly 5 million rials, driven by increased demand and favorable market conditions.

Despite the overall growth, Al-Harthy noted setbacks in some sectors, including packaging, fisheries, and apparel, adding that the results still reflect the broader progress of the national economy and the government’s continued push for economic development.

“He pointed out that Credit Oman is making significant efforts to support Omani manufacturers and exporters, contributing to boosting their sales both locally and internationally by offering a range of insurance services and overcoming the challenges associated with Omani products entering global and new markets,” the OMA report added.

In its earlier outlook, Credit Oman projected strong growth potential for the country’s non-oil exports in 2025. The agency cited an estimated untapped export capacity of 5 billion rials, according to the International Trade Centre.

However, it emphasized that realizing this potential would depend on evolving global trade conditions, particularly the impact of emerging tariff and non-tariff barriers, geopolitical uncertainty, and shifts in global economic trends.

This growth comes after a challenging 2024, when Oman’s non-oil exports declined 16 percent due in part to a reclassification of high-value fuel-related goods into the oil and gas category.

The 2025 rebound suggests improved export diversification, aided by Credit Oman’s efforts and favorable conditions in sectors like agriculture and plastics.

LONDON: Most stock markets in the Gulf were trading higher on Sunday, relatively unscathed by escalating tension in the region following US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, as investors assessed the potential economic impact of the conflict.

US forces struck Iran’s three main nuclear sites late on Saturday, and President Donald Trump warned Tehran it would face more devastating attacks if it does not agree to peace.

By around 0915 GMT, Saudi Arabia’s benchmark index TASI had edged 0.4 percent higher, helped by a 0.7 percent rise in the country’s biggest lender, Saudi National Bank. Qatar’s benchmark index QSI had gained 0.2 percent, reversing slight early losses.

“It is admittedly a bit surprising to see regional equities shrugging off the US strikes on Iran with relative ease, with opening losses having pared relatively rapidly,” said Michael Brown, Senior Research Strategist at Pepperstone.

Brown said that the markets had already discounted the probability of a US attack, and investors anticipated a swifter resolution to the conflict following the attacks.

The market is focused on whether the conflict spreads to other nations in the region, with there being no sign of that happening right now, he added.

Bahrain and Kuwait, home to US bases, made preparations on Sunday for the possibility of the conflict spreading to their territory, with Bahrain urging drivers to avoid main roads and Kuwait establishing shelters in a ministries complex.

Kuwait’s premier index reversed early losses to trade 0.3 percent higher by around the same time, while Bahrain’s main index was flat. The Omani share index MSX30 was up 0.5 percent.

Elsewhere in the Middle East, Egypt’s benchmark index EGX30 was trading 1.7 percent higher, while the main index in Tel Aviv was up around 1 percent to reach its all-time high.

RIYADH: Cement sales in Saudi Arabia climbed 6.4 percent year on year in the first quarter of 2025 to 13.4 million tonnes, driven by a construction surge tied to Vision 2030 megaprojects.

According to data from Al Yamama Cement covering the Kingdom’s 17 producers, local sales accounted for nearly 13 million tonnes, while exports edged up to 408,000 tonnes.

Al Yamama Cement led the domestic market with 1.68 million tonnes, followed by Saudi Cement at 1.33 million tonnes and Qassim Cement with 1.25 million tonnes.

Saudi Arabia is powering through the largest construction surge in its history, a pillar of the Vision 2030 diversification plan. A Bloomberg report this month valued the live roster of real estate and infrastructure schemes at roughly $1.3 trillion, ranging from Riyadh’s driverless metro grid and entertainment hubs like Qiddiya to the brand-new cities of NEOM on the Red Sea coast and New Murabba in the capital’s northwest.

Those giga-projects, along with heritage revamps such as Diriyah Gate and the Red Sea’s string of luxury resorts, have now moved well beyond site grading and piling.

Gulf Construction, a trade journal for the building and construction industries, noted in May that major project packages are entering the concrete-intensive vertical-build phase, where tower cores, bridge piers, and precast facades consume significantly more cement and clinker than earlier earthworks.

In short, the Kingdom’s transition from drawing board to steel-and-concrete reality is fueling an insatiable appetite for building materials — and cement producers are gearing up their kilns to meet it.

Momentum kept building after March. Domestic sales jumped 42.9 percent year on year to 4.18 million tonnes in April, while exports rose 26.9 percent to 703,000 tonnes, according to Al Jazira Capital’s latest dispatch survey. Contractors are pouring concrete early, keen to stay ahead of the summer heat and tighten project timelines.

Profits do not rise equally

Higher volumes did not translate into across-the-board gains. International Cement Review’s CemNet bulletin said in June that sector-wide net profit fell 16 percent in the first quarter to about SR648 million ($173 million) despite stronger turnover.

Yamama Cement posted about SR142 million in earnings — up 23 percent — while Saudi Cement slipped nearly 5 percent to SR108 million. Qassim Cement improved 27 percent to roughly SR94 million, but Al Jouf Cement stayed in the red at around SR15 million.

Producers faced an added challenge from Saudi Aramco’s fuel price revision, effective Jan. 1, which several companies warned would raise kiln fuel costs by around 10 percent.

Inventory cushions remain thick. Al Yamama figures show Yanbu holding 18.9 million tonnes of clinker at end-March, with Southern Province close behind on 18.1 million tonnes. Across the sector, stockpiles cover roughly nine months of normal domestic demand, allowing firms to throttle kilns if margins tighten.

Modern kilns slash fuel use

According to Global Cement’s April report, engineering firm Sinoma has finished erecting a new preheater tower as part of Yamama Cement’s relocation and upgrade project south of Riyadh.

The upgrade increases the former 10,000-tonne-per-day line to 12,500 tonnes, with Sinoma noting it had to dismantle, relocate, and integrate large equipment while installing the latest kiln technology.

Completion of the tower clears the way for commissioning and final handover of the higher-capacity, fuel-efficient plant.

The efficiency drive extends to the Red Sea coast, where Yanbu Cement’s 34 megawatts waste-heat-recovery system already supplies about a quarter of the plant’s electricity.

The upgrades are crucial because older kiln designs waste a great deal of fuel. According to the European Cement Association, long-dry kilns consume about one-third more energy than the latest preheater–pre-calciner models, while old wet kilns can burn up to 85 percent more.

By contrast, modern PH-PC lines require only about 3.3 gigajoules of heat to produce one tonne of clinker — roughly the energy contained in 30 litres of petrol. Transitioning from long-dry or wet kilns to PH-PC technology significantly reduces fuel consumption, lowers production costs, and cuts carbon emissions — all critical advantages as energy prices continue to rise.

With Saudi Aramco’s January fuel-tariff hike expected to raise kiln-energy bills by around 10 percent, plants that already sip less fuel will feel the pinch far less — and that cost edge is flowing straight into sharper export offers, reinforcing the Kingdom’s competitive position in nearby markets.",https://www.arabnews.pk/sites/default/files/styles/660x371_watermarkpakistan/public/main-image/2025/06/22/4614126-2087809185.jpeg?itok=r9TPFQY3,N,,2025-06-22 10:05:54.715990

The three aerospace companies plan to develop the future ENGHE (European Next Generation Helicopter Engine), a new 100% European engine for Europe’s next generation of military rotorcraft, scheduled to enter into service around 2040. At Paris Air Show, a long-term partnership agreement was signed to this effect.

The partners are convinced European armed forces need a new engine with advanced design maturity and affordable operating and maintenance costs. To tackle this challenge, workshare will be distributed equally between Safran, MTU and Avio Aero. The companies’ cooperation will form the core of an extended and long-term European partnership involving participants from other European nations.

This increased partnership underscores the strong progress made on the project over the past two years: Safran and MTU announced their collaboration on a new helicopter engine in 2023. Last year, the two companies established a 50/50 joint venture, EURA (EUropean Military Rotorcraft Engine Alliance), to develop the engine. Now, Avio Aero will contribute its expertise and capabilities in military helicopter engines.

Cédric Goubet, CEO of Safran Helicopter Engines, commented: “We are delighted to extend our cooperation in the field of future military helicopter engines with Avio Aero. The next step in this decisive cooperation to strengthen Europe’s autonomy in the field of defence and security will be to respond to the specific call for a future helicopter engine within the European Defence Fund, with the versatile European team of top European aerospace partners that has already been set up under the coordination of EURA.”

Michael Schreyögg, Chief Program Officer of MTU Aero Engines, commented: “Achieving breakthrough success requires a strong alliance of industry leaders from across the continent. The fact that Avio Aero, MTU and Safran have joined forces underlines the importance of this program in further reinforcing European sovereignty and strengthening the European supply chain. Together, we are starting the next chapter in Europe’s defence history and adding another success story to our record of cooperation. By maintaining strong relationships and involving partners across Europe, we are shaping the future.”

Riccardo Procacci, CEO of Avio Aero, commented: “We are proud to join forces with Safran Helicopter Engines and MTU Aero Engines to collaborate on the development of a European turboshaft engine that will power the next generation military rotorcraft. This agreement is a major opportunity for the aerospace industry to work together in support of Europe’s strategic autonomy and technological leadership. At Avio Aero, we are excited to play a key role in this collaboration, offering our industrial capabilities and expertise in turboshaft engine development to meet future needs of European armed forces.”

During the ceremony, Mr. Sean White, European Defence Agency’s Director for Industry, Synergies and Enablers, praised the signatories and highlighted the urgency and significance of cross-border industrial cooperation for reinforcing our continent’s sovereignty and supply chain security.

This partnership between Avio Aero, MTU and Safran Helicopter Engines will enhance the robustness and relevance of the proposal for the European Defence Fund’s specific call for a next-generation helicopter engine. The proposal will be coordinated by EURA and submitted to the European Commission in October 2025.

The future ENGHE (European Next Generation Helicopter Engine) will feature breakthrough technologies that will considerably increase its efficiency while reducing its operating and maintenance costs. It will be particularly well suited to the ENGRT (European Next Generation Rotorcraft Technologies) and NGRC (Next Generation Rotorcraft Capability) projects. ENGHE’s exceptional characteristics will provide these future helicopters with enhanced capabilities, such as greater range, higher speed, improved maneuverability and increased availability. In addition to these improvements, the engine will also feature reduced fuel burn, be 100% compatible with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and incorporate enhanced electric hybridization.",https://www.edrmagazine.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ENGHE-European-Helicopter-Engine.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 10:06:00.548185

Electric air taxis take off vertically and go from point-to-point terminals across metropolitan areas, greatly reducing travel times. In theory, at least.

Investors are excited about the prospect, sending Archer Aviation shares soaring in the last year as it gets closer and closer to operating a taxi network. Will Archer Aviation disrupt the transportation market? Should you buy the stock? The answer may surprise you.

Flying above the traffic

Founded in 2018, Archer Aviation has devoted the last few years to designing and building its Midnight model aircraft. It already has some approvals from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to operate an air taxi service, and it is currently working to get FAA approvals for the Midnight model. If approved, the company has already established multiple partnerships to bring the eVTOL concept to cities around the world. eVTOLs are different from helicopters in that they use battery-electric power and much quieter propellers, which will enable them to operate in areas with more people.

For example, Archer Aviation has a partnership with United Airlines to bring a point-to-point network to New York City, helping passengers skip traffic as they head to the airport. It is working with cities around the globe, including Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. It is even a working sponsor of the Los Angeles Olympic Games, with eVTOL trips set to take place during the 2028 event, if all goes according to plan.

Archer Aviation raised a lot of money to help fund its efforts. As of the first quarter of 2025, it had paid-in capital of $2.79 billion. Recently, it did another capital raise of $850 million with a common stock offering at $10 a share. The company estimates it has $2 billion of liquidity to fund its growth plans. It may need every penny. The company reported $450 million in negative free cash flow this year.

Will people be willing to pay up for a ticket?

The business model for Archer Aviation is still under development. First, it needs to get full approval from the FAA. Then, it will start selling its Midnight aircraft to customers or work with partners to operate its own taxi networks. Each air taxi will be manned by a pilot and has room for four passengers and their luggage.

The Midnight is estimated to sell for $5 million per vehicle, with likely slim profit margins, especially if there are bulk discounts like with airplane sales. Boeing, for reference, had a gross margin of just over 10% at its peak (it is much lower today). If each ticket costs $100 per passenger, there are 10 flights a day, and all four tickets are booked on every flight, that is $4,000 in daily revenue for each eVTOL. Annually, that is $1.46 million in revenue for each aircraft.

While that may seem like a lot of money, it will take years for operators of the air taxis to make up for their upfront aircraft purchases and operating costs at these ticket prices. Pilots need salaries, and the electric battery power is not free. In order to operate profitably, tickets for eVTOL routes will need to cost much more than $100. It is unclear how much demand there would be for a product like this, especially if potential passengers are already paying for an airline ticket.

This, in my mind, is the largest hurdle to Archer Aviation's business model. Investors should be worried about this more than FAA approval.

Data by YCharts.

Disruption is a long way away

Even if Archer Aviation keeps making progress with its electric air taxi, it will be a long time before any disruption happens to traffic in major cities. 10,000 air taxi trips a day -- which would take hundreds if not a thousand taxis flying around in a single city, something that is likely not going to be deemed safe by the FAA -- may take an equivalent amount of trips off the road. This is nowhere near the traffic figures in a major city like New York. On the Brooklyn Bridge alone, over 100,000 cars travel every day.

Traffic problems will not be solved by eVTOLs anytime soon. That does not mean there is no demand for a point-to-point air taxi network. Perhaps a few wealthier customers will be willing to spend hundreds of dollars a ticket to skip out on an hour of traffic heading to the airport and back. What should concern investors is the business model for Archer Aviation and the stock's valuation.

Archer Aviation has a market cap of $6.5 billion, and that is before considering its recent stock offering. It is generating zero revenue today. In the future, it may sell 100 eVTOL units a year, which could translate into $500 million in revenue. With slim profit margins, this would likely turn into less than $100 million in bottom-line earnings, and that is many years from now. Its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) would still be sky high. The company is burning a lot of cash. You get the picture.

I don't believe Archer Aviation can solve traffic issues in cities, and I believe the stock is overvalued today. Avoid adding this hot stock to your portfolio right now.

GTF-A Engines: What Are The Key Differences? - Simple Flying,Louis Hardiman,,,,,https://simpleflying.com/pratt-whitney-gtf-vs-gtf-a-differences-guide/,"He said: “GTF engines already offer the lowest fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions for single-aisle aircraft.
The announcement came a week after another announcement of the A321XLR with GTF engines receiving type certification from the European Union Safety Agency (EASA).
The GTF family has also been hit by inflight failures that could have caused serious accidents.
The PW1500G engines, also geared turbofans, have also faced issues with inflight shutdowns that the GTF-A will need to avoid.
It will also power the A320neo family and offer improvements of a few percentage points across several key metrics.","The Pratt & Whitney PW1100G, a variant of the engine series marketed as the P&W GTF, used on the A320neo, has received a further update, the GTF Advantage (GTF-A). This engine was announced in December 2021, with the manufacturer claiming it to have better fuel efficiency, durability, and the ability to deliver high thrust at hot and high-altitude airports.

This article explores the major differences between the GTF series and the GTF-A, as well as the methods used to achieve these distinctions. It then examines when the GTF-A will enter service and the pitfalls experienced by the PW1100G that will need to be avoided. What will become clear is that the GTF-A is not a radically different engine. Rather, it is an improvement that offers P&W the chance to wipe the slate clean after multiple issues with the PW1100G.

What Are The Key Differences?

The GTF-A builds on the GTF series, which already offers the lowest fuel consumption for single-aisle aircraft. The GTF-A offers even greater fuel efficiency, with claims of a 1% improvement. Tom Pelland, the company's GTF chief engineer, claims that the engine will have 8% greater thrust at hot and high airports, and 4% better thrust at sea level. Engines often struggle in these conditions that cause reduced air pressure. It also builds on the successful testing of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on the GTF series, with Pratt & Whitney aiming for the engine to be 100% SAF compatible. The improvements will enable airlines to fly longer, carry higher payloads, and have a reduced environmental impact.

Pratt & Whitney has achieved this progression on an already successful engine through several advancements. The company's engineers have increased core airflow by optimizing the active clearance control between the turbine and seals, lowered the high-pressure compressor temperatures, and used more durable coatings and blisk rotors.

Risk Deurloo, President of Commercial Engines for Pratt & Whitney, commented on what these advancements will mean for the aviation industry. He said:

“GTF engines already offer the lowest fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions for single-aisle aircraft. The GTF Advantage engine extends that lead and enhances aircraft capability, providing more thrust and even more value to operators of A320neo family aircraft, especially on longer-range aircraft like the A321XLR, all with a more durable configuration.”

The GTF-A also emerges from a different context than the original GTF turbofan. The original GTF brought new geared technology to the commercial aviation industry. This ground has already been broken for the GTF-A. Engineers were able to use 100,000 hours of engine and rig testing across the GTF family and 40 million flight hours to develop an improved engine.

Why Was The P&W GTF So Revolutionary?

In most cases, a turbofan's turbine and fan rotate at the same speed. The PW1000G family bucks this trend as a geared turbofan, a design decision shared with the GTF-A engine. A geared turbofan is fitted with a gearbox, allowing the turbine and fan to rotate at different and optimum speeds. This brings advantages in terms of fuel consumption and reduced noise pollution.

This technology was not entirely new with the P&W GTF. Turbomeca Aspin developed small-geared turbofans in the 1950s, and the Garrett TFE731 and Lycoming ALF 502 engines went into production in the 1970s. However, the idea didn't catch on due to concerns about weight and reliability. General Electric and Safran opted not to use geared technology when developing the CFM LEAP family for this reason.

The table below outlines the key specifications of the PW1100G. This is the engine from the P&W GTF family that the GTF-A is most closely derived from:

The successful use of geared technology by Pratt & Whitney has inspired some other manufacturers to develop geared turbofans. Rolls-Royce has been developing its UltraFan since 2016. The scaled-down UltraFan 30 is a clear competitor to the PW1100G. It is designed for single-aisle aircraft, generating 30,000 lbf (130 kN) of thrust. The manufacturer plans to run this engine by 2028.

Powering The Same Aircraft

As well as using the same propulsion methodology, the GTF-A will also power the same aircraft family: the A320neo. The engine will compete with the CFM International LEAP-1A and attempt to make a stronger case for geared turbofans.

If it can be reliable, the GTF-A will be an enticing option for A320neo customers. This jet was designed to be 15-20% more efficient than previous models, demonstrating a clear alignment in missions. The table below details the A320neo's specifications. Although the A320neo family includes the A319neo, A320neo, A321neo, A321LR, and A321XLR, all of which have the PW1100G as an engine option, the table consists of data for the A320neo itself:

The GTF-A is also likely to reach the thousands of orders achieved by the PW1100G. As of May 2025, 3,954 A320neo jets have been built, but thousands more are still to come. Airbus has achieved a total of 11,128 A320neo orders.

When Will The GTF-A Enter Service?

The GTF-A has achieved US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification, and deliveries are expected to begin later in 2025. The announcement came a week after another announcement of the A321XLR with GTF engines receiving type certification from the European Union Safety Agency (EASA).

In February 2025, when this announcement was made, over 2,200 GTF-powered aircraft had been delivered to 80 customers worldwide. These engines improved fuel efficiency by 20% and saved over 2 billion gallons of fuel. Airlines flying with GTF turbofans have reduced their CO2 output by 20 million metric tons. The engine also remained popular despite groundings and reliability issues, and the company had 11,000 engine orders and commitments across the GTF family.

Deurloo, President of Commercial Engines for Pratt & Whitney, commented on the significance of the certifications for the company's storied history. He said:

“With this certification and engine deliveries on track for later this year, it’s fitting we mark these milestones in 2025, as Pratt & Whitney celebrates a century of powering the future.”

P&W Will Want To Avoid Replicating The PW1100G's Failures

The P&W GTF has had some concerning failures. The manufacturer will want to avoid these problems resurfacing once it launches the GTF-A. Ongoing issues with specific engine parts led RTX, P&W's parent company, to announce that it will be removing 600–700 engines between 2023 and 2026. This was set to require 350 aircraft to be grounded, with a turnaround time of 250-300 days for each jet. The manufacturer would have to remove and reinstall each engine on the wing. Neil Mitchill, RTX's chief, stated that the company would pay out $1 billion in credits for grounded aircraft.

The GTF family has also been hit by inflight failures that could have caused serious accidents. The Indian Airline IndiGo reported four in-flight engine stalls during a climb in October 2019. All were traced to problems with the Low-Pressure Turbine (LPT). The Indian Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) later instructed the airline to replace the engines on 98 of its A320neos.

The PW1500G engines, also geared turbofans, have also faced issues with inflight shutdowns that the GTF-A will need to avoid. These problems were largely with Swiss International Air Lines Airbus A220s. In one case, the engine shut down because a faulty O-ring seal led to a loss of oil pressure. In another incident, a little less than a year later, the engine's low-pressure compressor disintegrated as the jet climbed to 32,000 ft. The Swiss International Airlines A220-300 had to divert to Paris-Charles de Gaulle.

GTF-A Is A Chance To Rewrite The History Of Geared Turbofans

In developing the PW1000G family of geared turbofans, Pratt & Whitney aimed to set a new standard of efficiency for the aviation industry. It has achieved this, but only when the engines have been operational. CFM International's concerns about the reliability of geared turbofans may have been vindicated due to the P&W GTF family's groundings and in-flight shutdowns. It is noteworthy that other engine manufacturers haven't clamored to produce geared turbofans.

To some, the GTF-A could represent more of the same. It will also power the A320neo family and offer improvements of a few percentage points across several key metrics. Yet, the GTF-A is also a chance to wipe the slate clean. If this engine can reliably deliver the advantages it offers, other manufacturers will have to take notice.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/engine-2.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 10:06:38.394169

With some union officials unaware of — or unwilling to comply with — settled law, it’s more important than ever for public employees in the state to understand their rights under union representation.
In 2020, Colorado union officials gained mandatory collective bargaining affecting state employees.
Now, union officials want to fundamentally change the state’s labor landscape once again.
In Connecticut, union officials insisted that school cook Tina Curtis abide by a requirement, similar to Pueblo’s, that forced employees to pay union fees.","Imagine starting a job in public service, only to be told you must hand over a cut of each paycheck to a labor union — years after the U.S. Supreme Court has already declared this requirement illegal.

Unfortunately, this isn’t a hypothetical for thousands of public employees in Colorado.

Consider the city of Pueblo, which employs an estimated 2,000 workers. The Pueblo Association of Government Employees union, also called AFSCME Local 1712, claims it can charge so-called “fair share fees” to the technicians, park caretakers, engineers and other employees who help Pueblo run, but who choose not to join the union. That’s according to the active collective bargaining agreement between the city and the union.

The problem? The agreement directly contradicts the U.S. Supreme Court’s Janus decision, where the court, in 2018, ruled that public-sector unions could not force nonmember employees to pay fees to a union.

If union officials are acting on this contract provision and charging fees to nonmembers, they are breaking the law. And even if the provision isn’t being enforced, it still has consequences.

Pueblo’s unconstitutional contract language makes it seem as though an employee’s only options are to join the union and pay dues, or decline union membership and pay up anyway.

It’s not much of a choice — the union is effectively strong-arming employees into joining their ranks.

Pueblo’s contract isn’t even the worst offender in Colorado. The Denver Housing Authority’s contract, enacted this year, says that its 300-plus employees must be full, dues-paying members of the union, AFSCME Local 535.

If enforced, the requirement could be one of the most egregious violations of public employees’ rights of free speech and association anywhere in the country.

With some union officials unaware of — or unwilling to comply with — settled law, it’s more important than ever for public employees in the state to understand their rights under union representation. And because union power has been steadily rising, Pueblo’s and Denver’s problematic union contracts should concern all Colorado workers.

In 2020, Colorado union officials gained mandatory collective bargaining affecting state employees. Three years ago, they landed compulsory organizing of many county workers. And the following year, Colorado lawmakers granted more favorable rules on how certain municipalities, universities, schools, and hospitals interact with and speak about unions.

Now, union officials want to fundamentally change the state’s labor landscape once again.

They have pledged to overturn Gov. Jared Polis’s recent veto of Senate Bill 5, legislation that would help unions force private-sector workers to pay a union as a requirement of their job. Union advocates have promised a referendum, making clear that even the governor’s veto pen won’t end their push to expand labor’s reach.

Public workers across the Rocky Mountain State need to know their rights under union representation so that they aren’t vulnerable to misinformation, even when it shows up in their employment contracts.

This sort of misinformation is not limited to Colorado. Indeed, union officials in many other states have been caught using the relative obscurity of labor law to get their way at employees’ expense.

In Connecticut, union officials insisted that school cook Tina Curtis abide by a requirement, similar to Pueblo’s, that forced employees to pay union fees. As in Pueblo, union officials had ample time to comply with the Janus ruling that banned these fees for nonmembers but conveniently ignored it.

Curtis sued union officials with the help of the Fairness Center, the nonprofit law firm where I serve as president, forcing the union to change its collective bargaining agreement and promise not to violate workers’ rights in this way again.

But there’s no way to know exactly how many other employees — in Connecticut, Colorado and nationwide — are being fed similar misinformation and could be funding union activity with money they have a right to withhold.

Of course, labor unions should follow the law when they enter binding legal agreements with employers. But if union officials act like they don’t know the law, it will be up to workers to know — and defend — their rights.",https://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2025-06-22 10:06:42.123416

Los llamados e-fuels, o combustibles sintéticos, han emergido como una de las grandes apuestas para descarbonizar industrias que, hasta ahora, presentaban enormes dificultades para reducir sus emisiones, como la aviación o el transporte pesado.

Estos combustibles, generados a partir de hidrógeno verde y CO₂ capturado, prometen una menor huella ambiental y una compatibilidad total con las infraestructuras actuales. Sin embargo, el sector enfrenta todavía retos económicos y tecnológicos importantes para que el uso de e-fuels se generalice a gran escala en los próximos años.

¿Cómo se producen los e-fuels y por qué se consideran sostenibles?

Los e-fuels son líquidos o gases sintéticos creados combinando hidrógeno obtenido por electrólisis de agua usando electricidad renovable y dióxido de carbono capturado, normalmente de procesos industriales o incluso directamente del aire. El resultado es un combustible que, al ser quemado, emite el mismo CO₂ que se utilizó en su producción, lo que permite considerarlo carbono neutral, especialmente si toda la cadena se basa en energía renovable.

Algunos ejemplos de estos combustibles son la e-gasolina, e-diesel y e-queroseno, este último con un papel fundamental en la descarbonización de la aviación, donde la electrificación es inviable para vuelos de largo recorrido.

Aplicación en la aviación: avances y desafíos

El sector aéreo está en el punto de mira, ya que la aviación representa aproximadamente el 2,5% de las emisiones globales de CO₂ provenientes de la energía. Los e-fuels, específicamente el denominado e-SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel sintético), ofrecen la posibilidad de reducir hasta un 90% las emisiones respecto a los combustibles convencionales de aviación.

Compañías como OXCCU, junto con otras startups y grandes multinacionales, han realizado pruebas exitosas de vuelos utilizando mezclas de e-fuel. Por ejemplo, KLM y la fuerza aérea británica ya han volado utilizando e-SAF, aunque en cantidades limitadas y en demostraciones.

El principal obstáculo para la expansión del e-fuel en aviación sigue siendo el coste: fabricar un litro de e-fuel puede llegar a ser tres veces más caro que el queroseno tradicional. Para paliar esta diferencia, la Unión Europea y el Reino Unido están desplegando políticas de incentivos y marcos regulatorios que establecen cuotas obligatorias de SAF en los próximos años. Por ejemplo, la UE exigirá que el 0,7% del combustible de aviación sea e-SAF en 2030, mientras que el Reino Unido tiene su propio calendario para aumentar el uso de estos productos.

La escalabilidad también representa un reto fundamental. Producir suficiente hidrógeno verde y captar el CO₂ necesario requiere una gran inversión en instalaciones y energías renovables, además de cooperación internacional y un marco regulatorio estable que brinde seguridad a largo plazo a los productores.

Crecimiento del mercado global y tendencias

El mercado de los e-fuels está creciendo de forma acelerada. Según informes recientes, en 2024 el valor global del mercado se situó en torno a los 159.850 millones de dólares y se espera que alcance los 900.800 millones para 2034, lo que supone una tasa de crecimiento anual compuesto cercana al 19%. La controversia sobre los biocombustibles y su impacto en las emisiones también ha influido en el interés hacia los e-fuels.

Europa lidera actualmente en la adopción y desarrollo de e-fuels gracias a su ambiciosa legislación en materia de descarbonización y a la inversión pública y privada en proyectos de I+D. La región Asia-Pacífico, por su parte, se proyecta como la que experimentará una mayor expansión en los próximos años, impulsada por el crecimiento industrial y la necesidad de reducir la contaminación atmosférica.

Empresas como INERATEC GmbH, Carbon Recycling International, Sunfire GmbH, LanzaTech, Siemens Energy AG y Neste Oyj son algunos de los actores destacados en el sector. Además, compañías energéticas consolidadas como TotalEnergies y Uniper SE también están invirtiendo en estas tecnologías, desarrollando plantas piloto y nuevas líneas de negocio para la producción de combustibles sintéticos.

Perspectivas regulatorias y fiscales

La adopción de los e-fuels está estrechamente vinculada a la existencia de marcos regulatorios claros e incentivos fiscales. La Unión Europea, por ejemplo, ha establecido un sistema de comercio de derechos de emisión (ETS), que permite financiar la diferencia de precio entre SAF y queroseno convencional mediante subvenciones específicas, facilitando así la entrada de los combustibles sintéticos en el mercado.

Países como Reino Unido planean que, para 2030, al menos el 10% de todo el combustible de aviación sea sostenible, aumentando a un 22% para 2040. Algunas aerolíneas, como KLM, han comenzado a probar suplementos en el precio de los billetes para financiar la compra de SAF, evaluando la disposición de los consumidores a colaborar en la transición.

Es probable que solo una combinación inteligente de inversión pública, regulación coherente y apoyo del sector privado permita que los e-fuels alcancen precios competitivos y una producción suficiente en la próxima década.

Oportunidades industriales y retos futuros

El desarrollo de los e-fuels abre la puerta a una nueva industria energética que puede transformar la producción y el consumo de combustibles líquidos y gaseosos. La utilización de CO₂ capturado y energía renovable podría convertir a los e-fuels en una pieza clave no solo en la aviación, sino también en sectores difíciles de electrificar, como el transporte marítimo, ferroviario y algunas industrias.

El alto coste inicial de las plantas de producción, el acceso a hidrógeno verde a gran escala y la infraestructura necesaria para el suministro y la logística son algunos de los obstáculos a superar. No obstante, la colaboración entre empresas tecnológicas, energéticas y gobiernos está promoviendo la innovación, con la esperanza de que los e-fuels se conviertan en una parte habitual del mix energético global.",https://www.renovablesverdes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/e-fuel-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 10:07:05.184687

Et si nos frites devenaient les alliées d’un ciel plus vert ? En France, Total Energies mise désormais sur nos huiles de friture usagées pour en faire du carburant d’avion. Un partenariat ambitieux vient d’être signé afin de recycler près de 60 000 tonnes d’huiles chaque année et soutenir le développement des biocarburants durables.

Des huiles de friture collectées pour alimenter les futures bioraffineries

À l’occasion du salon du Bourget, Total Energies a officialisé un accord avec Quatra, un acteur spécialisé dans la récupération d’huiles alimentaires. Ensemble, ils prévoient de collecter 60 000 tonnes d’huiles de cuisson usagées par an, principalement issues des restaurants et de l’industrie agroalimentaire dans plusieurs pays européens.

Ces huiles, une fois récoltées, seront utilisées dans deux bioraffineries françaises : celle de La Mède, déjà en activité près de Marseille, et celle de Grandpuits, encore en cours de transformation. Cette dernière devrait ouvrir ses portes en 2026. Toutes deux sont conçues pour transformer des déchets organiques en carburants plus respectueux de l’environnement.

Un objectif ambitieux pour réduire l’empreinte carbone de l’aviation

Total Energies ne cache pas son ambition : produire à terme 500 000 tonnes de carburants durables d’aviation chaque année d’ici 2028. Ces biocarburants, appelés SAF (pour Sustainable Aviation Fuel), sont censés représenter une alternative plus écologique au kérosène traditionnel.

Derrière cette démarche, il y a aussi une pression réglementaire croissante. Depuis peu, les compagnies aériennes opérant au départ de l’Union européenne sont tenues d’incorporer au moins 2 % de SAF dans leur carburant. Cette part minimum passera à 6 % d’ici 2030. Autant dire que les acteurs du secteur n’ont plus vraiment le choix s’ils veulent rester dans les clous.

Un levier stratégique pour l’avenir de l’énergie

Du côté de Total Energies, on rappelle régulièrement que le développement des biocarburants est un axe clé pour l’avenir. L’entreprise investit massivement dans ce type de production alternative, compatible avec les moteurs d’avion actuels. Cela permettrait de réduire jusqu’à 80 % des émissions de CO2 sur l’ensemble du cycle de vie du carburant, selon les données disponibles.

Et au passage, cela donne une vraie seconde vie à des déchets alimentaires qui, autrefois, finissaient souvent à la poubelle ou dans les canalisations. C’est assez fou, mais nos restes de nuggets ou de frites pourraient bientôt aider à faire décoller des avions un peu plus propres à travers le monde.

Theo DHL Trade Atlas 2025, trong 5 năm tới, Indonesia dự kiến ​​sẽ được xếp hạng trong Top 30 quốc gia hàng đầu về tốc độ và quy mô tăng trưởng thương mại. Nền kinh tế năng động của nước này, được thúc đẩy bởi quá trình chuyển đổi số nhanh chóng và các khoản đầu tư vào cơ sở hạ tầng chiến lược, mang đến những cơ hội đáng kể cho các doanh nghiệp. Tuy nhiên, môi trường kinh doanh bất ổn – đặc trưng bởi căng thẳng về địa chính trị và sự thay đổi mô hình thương mại – đặt ra những thách thức và bất ổn cho tăng trưởng.

Với sự hiện diện của 3 bộ phận thuộc DHL Group là DHL Express, DHL Global Forwarding và DHL Supply Chain – các doanh nghiệp có trụ sở tại Indonesia có thể khai thác các dịch vụ logistics trọn gói trên khắp các bộ phận, tiếp cận mạng lưới logistics toàn cầu rộng lớn và dựa vào chuyên môn sâu để giúp điều hướng các phức tạp thương mại biến động. Ngoài ra, các bộ phận của DHL đặc biệt tập trung vào việc hỗ trợ mở rộng các lĩnh vực phát triển nhanh tại Indonesia như xe điện, khoa học sự sống và chăm sóc sức khỏe, cũng như thương mại điện tử và bán lẻ.

Sự hiện diện của DHL rất phù hợp để giúp Indonesia và các doanh nghiệp đạt được tham vọng tăng trưởng

Những luồng gió thuận theo địa lý

Ông Ahmad Mohamad, Cố vấn kỹ thuật cấp cao của DHL Express Indonesia nhận xét: “Gần đây, các nước láng giềng của Indonesia đã nhận được sự chú ý khi nói đến khả năng phục hồi của chuỗi cung ứng, nhưng đất nước này còn nhiều điều để cống hiến. Chúng tôi có thị trường trong nước, nguồn nhân lực lớn và Chính phủ đã đầu tư vào việc hiện đại hóa ngành logistics thông qua nền tảng Hệ sinh thái logistics quốc gia”.

Ông Ahmad Mohamad cho biết thêm: “Chúng tôi cũng thấy các cơ hội tăng trưởng ở các thành phố ngoài khu vực Jakarta mở rộng, chẳng hạn như Surabaya, Semarang, Batam và Bali, cùng nhiều nơi khác, đây là những lựa chọn khả thi cho các doanh nghiệp muốn đa dạng hóa chuỗi cung ứng của mình. Quan trọng hơn, chúng tôi cũng muốn giúp các thương hiệu Indonesia mở rộng tầm nhìn của họ ra ngoài thị trường địa phương thông qua thương mại điện tử”.

Ngoài các thương hiệu quốc tế mở rộng sang Indonesia, còn có một nhóm ngày càng tăng các thương hiệu Indonesia đang vươn ra toàn cầu. Vị trí chiến lược của Indonesia và sự gần gũi với các thị trường lớn trong khu vực khiến nơi đây trở thành một địa điểm hấp dẫn như một trung tâm thương mại toàn cầu. Indonesia là một phần tích cực của ít nhất 12 hiệp định thương mại song phương và đa phương lớn, bao gồm Hiệp định Đối tác Kinh tế Toàn diện Khu vực (RCEP), hiện là hiệp định thương mại tự do (FTA) lớn nhất thế giới.

DHL Group đã đầu tư vào Indonesia để giúp thúc đẩy năng lực logistics và chuỗi cung ứng của quốc gia này. Công ty có hơn 4.000 nhân viên tại Indonesia, với khoảng 180 cơ sở trên khắp lãnh thổ nước này, nhằm đáp ứng nhu cầu của các công ty đang phát triển nhanh chóng tại đây.

Năng lượng mới

Ông Matthias Gehrsitz, Giám đốc điều hành của DHL Supply Chain Indonesia nhận định: “Một lĩnh vực khác mà chúng tôi thấy có cơ hội tăng trưởng lớn là năng lượng mới tại Indonesia, đặc biệt là pin xe điện. Mục tiêu của Indonesia là trở thành một trong ba nhà sản xuất pin xe điện hàng đầu thế giới vào năm 2027 cũng phù hợp với trọng tâm Chiến lược 2030 của chúng tôi trong lĩnh vực này”.

Ông Matthias Gehrsitz cho biết thêm: “Kể từ năm ngoái, chúng tôi đã chứng kiến ​​ít nhất bảy nhà sản xuất xe điện cam kết xây dựng các cơ sở sản xuất tại quốc gia này. Ngoài ra, còn có sự quan tâm lớn từ nhiều doanh nghiệp xe điện của Trung Quốc đang tìm kiếm một đối tác logistics có thể cung cấp dịch vụ logistics an toàn và tuân thủ từ đầu đến cuối. Kinh nghiệm hiện có của chúng tôi trong ngành ô tô với các khách hàng như Chery và Wuling Motors, cùng với năng lực và bí quyết trong ngành xe điện, giúp chúng tôi có vị thế hàng đầu để giúp các công ty xe điện điều hướng bối cảnh Indonesia”.

Để hỗ trợ ngành công nghiệp đang phát triển nhanh chóng này, khách hàng của DHL trong lĩnh vực này có quyền truy cập vào giải pháp logistics toàn diện từ đầu đến cuối được thiết kế riêng cho chuỗi cung ứng xe điện. Đó gồm:

Khoa học sự sống và chăm sóc sức khỏe

Ông Nicholas Bongsosartono, Giám đốc của DHL Global Forwarding Indonesia cho biết: “Ngành khoa học sự sống và chăm sóc sức khỏe của Indonesia rất lớn, nhưng vẫn đang phát triển. Indonesia phụ thuộc rất nhiều vào hàng nhập khẩu trong lĩnh vực này, nhưng chính phủ đang thúc đẩy giảm nhập khẩu và tự chủ hơn. Dự kiến, ​​giá trị thị trường của ngành dược phẩm sẽ tăng lên 11 tỷ USD (khoảng 9,5 tỷ euro) vào năm nay. Đối với chúng tôi, điều này có nghĩa là đầu tư vào cơ sở hạ tầng logistics phù hợp để hỗ trợ tham vọng này, chẳng hạn như triển khai các giải pháp chuỗi lạnh chuyên dụng khuyến khích các công ty thành lập cơ sở của họ tại Indonesia”,

DHL đã đầu tư vào Indonesia để đáp ứng nhu cầu của thị trường:

The so-called e fuels, or synthetic fuels, have emerged as one of the major bets for decarbonizing industries that, until now, have had enormous difficulties in reducing their emissions, such as aviation and heavy transport.

These fuels, generated from green hydrogen y CO₂ captured, promise a smaller environmental footprint and full compatibility with existing infrastructure. However, the sector still faces significant economic and technological challenges to ensure the widespread use of e-fuels in the coming years.

How are e-fuels produced and why are they considered sustainable?

E-fuels They are synthetic liquids or gases created by combining hydrogen obtained by electrolysis of water using renewable electricity and captured carbon dioxide, usually from industrial processes or even directly from the air. The result is a fuel that, when burned, emits the same CO₂ that was used in its production., which allows us to consider it neutral carbon, especially if the entire chain is based on renewable energy.

Some examples of these fuels are: e-gasoline, e-diesel y e-kerosene, the latter playing a key role in the decarbonization of aviation, where electrification is unfeasible for long-haul flights.

Application in aviation: advances and challenges

The airline sector is in the spotlight, as aviation accounts for approximately 2,5% of global CO₂ emissions from energy. The e fuels, specifically the so-called e-SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel synthetic), offer the possibility of reducing emissions by up to 90% compared to conventional aviation fuels.

Companies like OXCCU, along with other startups and large multinationals, have carried out Successful flight tests using e-fuel blendsFor example, KLM and the British Air Force have already flown using e-SAF, albeit in limited numbers and for demonstration purposes.

The main obstacle to the expansion of e-fuel in aviation It remains the cost: manufacturing a liter of e-fuel can be as much as three times more expensive than traditional keroseneTo address this gap, the European Union and the United Kingdom are implementing incentive policies and regulatory frameworks that establish mandatory SAF quotas in the coming years. For example, the EU will require 0,7% of aviation fuel to be e-SAF by 2030, while the United Kingdom has its own timeline for increasing the use of these products.

Scalability also represents a fundamental challenge. Producing enough green hydrogen and capturing the necessary CO₂ requires a large investment in facilities and renewable energy, in addition to international cooperation and a stable regulatory framework that provides long-term security to producers.

Global market growth and trends

The market of e fuels is growing rapidly. According to recent reports, the global market value stood at around $2024 billion in 159.850 and is expected to reach 900.800 million by 2034, which represents a compound annual growth rate of around 19%. controversy over biofuels and their impact on emissions has also influenced interest in e-fuels.

Europe currently leads in the adoption and development of e-fuels thanks to its ambitious decarbonization legislation and public and private investment in R&D projects. The Asia-Pacific region, for its part, is projected to experience the greatest expansion in the coming years, driven by industrial growth and the need to reduce air pollution.

Companies like INERATEC GmbH, Carbon Recycling International, Sunfire GmbH, LanzaTech, Siemens Energy AG y Neste Oyj are some of the leading players in the sector. In addition, established energy companies such as TotalEnergies y Uniper SE They are also investing in these technologies, developing pilot plants and new business lines for the production of synthetic fuels.

Regulatory and tax perspectives

The adoption of the e fuels is closely linked to the existence of clear regulatory frameworks and tax incentivesThe European Union, for example, has established an emissions trading system (ETS), which allows the price difference between SAF and conventional kerosene to be financed through targeted subsidies, thus facilitating the entry of synthetic fuels into the market.

Countries like United Kingdom They plan for at least 2030% of all aviation fuel to be sustainable by 10, rising to 22% by 2040. Some airlines, such as KLM, have begun testing ticket price supplements to fund SAF purchases, assessing consumer willingness to assist with the transition.

It is likely that only one smart combination of public investment, coherent regulation and private sector support allow e-fuels to achieve competitive prices and sufficient production in the next decade.

Industrial opportunities and future challenges

The development of e fuels opens the door to a new energy industry that can transform the production and consumption of liquid and gaseous fuels. The use of CO₂ captured and renewable energy could make e-fuels a key player not only in aviation, but also in sectors that are difficult to electrify, such as shipping, rail, and some industries.

El high initial cost from production plants, access to large-scale green hydrogen and the infrastructure needed for supply and logistics are some of the obstacles to overcome. However, collaboration between technology companies, energy companies, and governments is promoting innovation, with the hope that e fuels become a regular part of the global energy mix.",https://www.renovablesverdes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/e-fuel-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 00:57:58.024374

Dalam era transisi energi global, kebutuhan akan bahan bakar alternatif yang rendah emisi menjadi sangat penting, terutama pada sektor transportasi udara. Industri penerbangan adalah salah satu penyumbang emisi karbon yang terus meningkat. Menurut laporan International Air Transport Association (IATA), emisi karbon dari penerbangan pada tahun 2023 mencapai lebih dari 900 juta ton CO, dan jumlah ini diperkirakan akan terus naik seiring pertumbuhan sektor penerbangan global. Di tengah urgensi tersebut, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) muncul sebagai solusi strategis untuk dekarbonisasi industri penerbangan. Indonesia, sebagai negara agraris dan maritim dengan keanekaragaman hayati dan komoditas pertanian yang besar, memiliki peluang luar biasa untuk memanfaatkan Crude Coconut Oil (CCO) atau minyak kelapa mentah sebagai bahan baku utama SAF.

Mengapa SAF Penting?

SAF adalah bahan bakar penerbangan yang berasal dari sumber daya terbarukan seperti minyak nabati, limbah biomassa, dan lemak hewan. Berbeda dengan avtur konvensional yang berasal dari minyak bumi, SAF memiliki jejak karbon yang jauh lebih rendah dan dapat menurunkan emisi CO hingga 80% dalam siklus hidupnya. Selain itu, SAF telah terbukti kompatibel dengan infrastruktur dan mesin pesawat yang ada, sehingga dapat digunakan langsung tanpa memerlukan modifikasi teknis.

Organisasi Penerbangan Sipil Internasional (ICAO) melalui program Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) mendorong penggunaan SAF secara global untuk mencapai target netral karbon. Target ini juga telah diadopsi oleh banyak maskapai dan pemerintah, termasuk Indonesia, yang memiliki komitmen Net Zero Emission (NZE) pada tahun 2060.

Crude Coconut Oil: Bahan Baku Lokal yang Ramah Lingkungan

Minyak kelapa mentah atau CCO merupakan hasil ekstraksi dari daging kelapa segar (copra) tanpa melalui proses pemurnian lanjutan. Berbeda dengan minyak sawit, CCO memiliki kandungan asam lemak jenuh rantai sedang seperti asam laurat yang tinggi (sekitar 45--50%), menjadikannya sangat cocok untuk proses konversi melalui teknologi HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids). Teknologi HEFA adalah jalur produksi SAF yang paling umum digunakan secara komersial dan telah disertifikasi oleh ASTM International.

Indonesia memiliki luas perkebunan kelapa sekitar 3,6 juta hektar yang tersebar dari Sumatera, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, hingga Maluku dan Papua. Produksi kelapa nasional mencapai lebih dari 16 juta ton per tahun, namun sayangnya sebagian besar produk kelapa hanya diproses menjadi kopra dan minyak goreng. Dengan pendekatan industrialisasi hijau, sebagian produksi CCO dapat dialihkan untuk produksi SAF, yang nilai ekonominya jauh lebih tinggi dan strategis.

Jika diasumsikan 10% dari total produksi kelapa nasional diolah menjadi CCO untuk SAF, maka potensi pasokan bisa mencapai sekitar 1 juta kiloliter per tahun. Jumlah ini cukup untuk memenuhi sebagian besar kebutuhan avtur domestik, sekaligus membuka peluang ekspor ke pasar global yang permintaannya terus meningkat.",http://assets.kompasiana.com/items/category/27-1628766766.jpg?t=o&v=1200,N,,2025-06-21 18:03:20.818818

SAF, la vía más realista hacia la aviación sostenible

El Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) es hoy la opción más inmediata para reducir las emisiones del sector aéreo, especialmente en rutas de media y larga distancia donde las tecnologías eléctricas aún no son viables. Al ser producido a partir de fuentes renovables —como aceites reciclados, residuos o hidrógeno verde— permite reducir entre un 50% y 60% las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero en comparación con el combustible fósil tradicional.

Desde 2021, el impulso internacional al SAF ha ganado tracción gracias al compromiso de la IATA de alcanzar emisiones netas cero en 2050, y a la implementación de mandatos de mezcla como el europeo, que exige un 6% de SAF para 2030.

Una hoja de ruta industrial para el sur argentino

El proyecto Eco-Refinerías del Sur se encuentra actualmente en etapa de factibilidad técnica y económica. Según sus promotores, el objetivo es no solo construir una planta de producción de SAF en territorio patagónico, sino también desarrollar una cadena de valor regional, con fuerte impacto industrial y generación de empleo calificado.

Además de la transferencia tecnológica, el acuerdo contempla una hoja de ruta integral que incluye la identificación de socios estratégicos, obtención de permisos, acuerdos de compra de largo plazo (offtake agreements), logística, y evaluación detallada de CAPEX y OPEX.

Sustainable Aviation CEO'su Duncan McCourt, yakıldığında karbon saldığını belirtiyor. Bu, üretiminde yenilenebilir enerji santrali kullanılırsa tamamen net sıfır olduğu anlamına geliyor. Ayrıca biyolojik kaynaklı SAF'ten farklı olarak hammadde sınırlamaları ve arazi kullanımı sorunları da sözkonusu değil.

The Independent'a konuşan McCourt, ""ticari seviyeye ölçeklendirmenin ve bunu makul bir maliyetle yapmanın"" engel teşkil ettiğini söylüyor.

Madigan daha ayrıntılı bir şekilde, e-yakıt tesislerinin maliyetinin ""yüksek olduğunu ve mevcut politikalar kapsamında gereken türde hidrojenin kıtlığının projeleri daha küçük ölçekli operasyonlarla sınırladığını"" açıklıyor.

Bunun ""maliyet verimliliğinin düşmesine ve kabul edilebilir sermaye getirisi elde etmek için çok yüksek fiyatlara yol açtığını"" ifade ediyor.

Madigan şöyle devam ediyor:

CO2 artı H2 yakıtlarını teşvik eden politikaların olduğu sadece iki pazar var (Birleşik Krallık ve AB) ve bunlar sadece atık hidrojen veya yeşil hidrojenin kullanımına izin veriyor. Birçok şirket sermaye harcamalarını azaltmanın yollarını arıyor ancak çoğu yaklaşım bu süreçte verimlilikten ödün veriyor.

Madigan, atmosferden CO2 yakalamanın ""çok fazla enerji gerektirdiğini ve dolayısıyla çok pahalı"" olduğunu ancak bu sorunun yakıt fiyatına daha az etki ettiğini söylüyor.

PEKİ ÇÖZÜM NE?

Bu kısmen politikacıların elinde.

McCourt ""Hidrojen üretmek ve karbonu büyük ölçekte yakalamak için gereken enerjinin maliyeti, başlıca zorluklardan biri"" diyor.

Bu sorunun üstesinden gelmek için kayda değer yatırımlar ve destekleyici hükümet politikalarına ihtiyaç var.

Peki havacılık endüstrisi ""havadan yakıt""ı benimseyecek mi? Birkaç havayolu şirketi uçuşları için alternatif yakıtlar denediğinden, bu olası görünüyor.

This transformation has had a profound impact on students—making global education more accessible, flexible, and diverse than ever before.

From study abroad programs to international conferences and research projects, aviation has opened new doors for learning and cultural exchange.

The Evolution of Student Travel

In the 1950s, studying abroad was largely a privilege for wealthy students due to the high cost and time required to travel. Fast-forward to today, and international education has become far more attainable.

Over 340,000 American students studied abroad in a recent year—an increase of 2% from the previous year, with similar trends seen globally. Though COVID-19 temporarily paused this growth, student mobility is once again on the rise.

While students often focus on destinations and experiences, few realize the essential role aviation plays in enabling these journeys. Airports, airline networks, and support staff are critical to the functioning of every global education program.

Many students choose to document and share their experiences through reflective essays, often using essay editing services to ensure clarity and professionalism in their writing. These personal stories enrich both academic and personal development.

How Flying Changed Everything

The influence of aviation on education goes far beyond transportation. It has reshaped how institutions, educators, and students approach learning:

More study destinations: Opportunities now exist beyond major capital cities.

Short-term global programs: Weekend or week-long trips are now logistically possible.

International faculty: Professors can now teach or conduct research across campuses.

Collaborative research: Global research teams can meet and work in person.

Home visits: International students can return home more easily and frequently.

As Richard Branson once said, “Students who travel handle global problems better.” Increasingly, universities agree—international experience is seen as a vital part of a modern education.

For students working on research-heavy projects, using a thesis writing service KingEssays can help them present international perspectives more effectively.

Aviation itself has also become a major academic and career field. Institutions such as Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and numerous flight schools around the world train thousands of future pilots, engineers, and aviation professionals each year.

The Democratization of Air Travel

Perhaps the most significant development in student mobility has been the rise of affordable air travel. Once considered a luxury, low-cost carriers like Ryanair, EasyJet, and Southwest Airlines have made flying more accessible than ever.

These airlines cut costs by:

Using secondary airports

Minimizing turnaround time

Charging for optional services

Relying on online bookings

Increasing seat density on planes

The result? Students can now book cross-country or even international flights for less than the price of a restaurant meal.

According to historical data, the cost of air travel has decreased by over 60% since 1970. Even with fluctuating fuel prices, competition and efficiency keep flights affordable—making international education feasible for many.

Busy students sometimes opt to pay someone to write an essay during their travels, helping them balance academic demands while making the most of their time abroad.

New Destinations and Opportunities

More accessible routes have expanded student options well beyond traditional study abroad locations. Destinations that were once difficult to reach are now part of the global education map.

Emerging cities for student programs include:

Da Nang, Vietnam – Green growth and sustainability studies

Medellín, Colombia – Urban transformation and social innovation

Kigali, Rwanda – African entrepreneurship and development

Tbilisi, Georgia – Cross-cultural and regional studies

Tallinn, Estonia – Digital governance and tech education

Major universities are also expanding their global footprints. Institutions like NYU have campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai, while Yale-NUS College in Singapore exemplifies international collaboration. These networks rely on aviation to link students, staff, and campuses across continents.

Technology and Sustainability Challenges

The growth in student air travel comes with environmental challenges. As climate awareness rises, many students are rethinking the environmental impact of their journeys.

Aviation’s sustainability efforts include:

Developing more fuel-efficient aircraft

Investing in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)

Offering carbon offset programs

Exploring hybrid and electric flight technology

Activists like Greta Thunberg have brought attention to the issue, choosing to avoid flying altogether. This has sparked conversation about balancing sustainability with the value of global education.

At the same time, virtual exchanges, hybrid courses, and remote internships are emerging as complementary—not replacement—tools for global learning.

The Future of Student Air Travel

What lies ahead?

Purpose-driven travel: Educational trips will focus on specific academic or cultural goals—e.g. architecture in Japan, agriculture in New Zealand, or cybersecurity in Israel.

Tailored student services: Airlines like Emirates now offer extra baggage allowances for students, and platforms like AirAsia promote dedicated student deals.

Blended learning models: Students may begin programs online and travel for short-term immersive sessions—combining flexibility with international experience.

As Emirates President Tim Clark noted, “New aircraft will make long-haul travel more affordable, opening up even more opportunities for global educational partnerships.”

Finding Balance in a Connected World

Today’s students are part of a globally connected education system unimaginable just decades ago. Aviation has turned what was once a rare opportunity into an essential aspect of academic and personal growth.

Going forward, students will continue to travel with intention—seeking deeper cultural engagement and real-world learning. Institutions will embed international experience into standard curricula, and airlines will evolve to meet this demand responsibly.

As the world becomes more connected, the skies remain a vital part of every student’s educational journey.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pexels-ekaterinabelinskaya-4671912-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 14:02:00.802398

Bottom line: Managing forest health and timber harvesting creates jobs, strengthens the economy, and reduces carbon emissions and wildfire risks.
The University of Minnesota leads this effort through partnerships with industry, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Minnesota DNR, supported by public investment.","Hiking through Minnesota’s majestic forests is a tradition enjoyed by generations. Studies show that time in nature boosts mental health and well-being. As you walk beneath the canopy, you might admire the wildlife or listen to a stream wind through the woods.

However, few people consider how Minnesota’s nearly 18 million acres of forests can drive bioinnovation, supporting both a healthy environment and economy. For those who do, they’d likely underestimate the growing diversity of products that can use components of wood sustainably harvested from our state’s forests.

Research at the University of Minnesota is leading the way to further develop those innovations, to work with industry and government agencies, to grow Minnesota’s forest resources economy, and to create jobs and improve our environment.

One such emerging opportunity is using woody biomass to produce climate-smart, low-carbon biofuels. In fact, dead and dying wood in our forests that can increase fire danger and intensity can instead be harvested and used to create sustainable aviation fuel to fly airplanes.

That financial “upcycling” of woody residuals can then support reinvestment in our forests to help them be more resilient to climate change, mitigating harm caused by wildfire, insects, invasive species, and disease. That’s a win-win for the economy — a $17 billion win annually — as well as for the environment and employment.

Timber harvesting is Minnesota’s fifth-largest manufacturing sector, contributing more than 8% of the state’s total manufacturing payroll. According to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, the state’s forest-products industry supports nearly 73,000 jobs.

Here at the University of Minnesota, one way we help advance the forest industry is by researching how forests can adapt to climate change and how to control invasive species. For example, warmer winters have allowed the western pine beetle to spread into Minnesota, killing pine trees and increasing the risk of wildfires. The Minnesota Invasive Plants and Pests Center, funded by the Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund through the Legacy Act, is developing new methods to stop its spread.

Clearly, forest loss also brings economic costs. Each acre burned or left unproductive loses $234 in carbon value, not to mention all the other products that could be created from that acre. Bottom line: Managing forest health and timber harvesting creates jobs, strengthens the economy, and reduces carbon emissions and wildfire risks. The University of Minnesota leads this effort through partnerships with industry, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Minnesota DNR, supported by public investment. The university offers the state’s only Society of American Foresters-accredited Forest and Natural Resource Management program, and its Bioproducts and Biosystems Engineering program turns forest resources into sustainable fuels, materials, and food ingredients.

Those living in thriving urban centers like Duluth, St. Cloud, or the Twin Cities gain from the trees in our urban forests. Trees lower the heat-island effect of cities, directly reducing energy costs of cooling your home in the summer. In the long run, the trees on your property can add as much as 10% to 20% to the value of your home. Urban forests are under stress, too, however, due to invasive pests and diseases like emerald ash borer and oak wilt, to name just two. We train the tree (arborists), insect (entomologists) and forest-disease (pathologists) scientists who help manage and protect these valuable natural assets for you and your community.

As you can see, our forests work hard for us. So, next time you walk in the woods, take a moment to appreciate the full value of trees — not just their beauty but also their essential role in sustaining our economy, our state, and our planet. Forests are often treated as free public goods, but their true worth is immeasurable. That’s why public investment is critical to advancing forest-based innovation and protecting these vital natural assets.

LOT Polish Airlines places its first-ever Airbus order

LOT Polish Airlines has placed a firm order with Airbus for 20 A220-100s and 20 A220-300s, marking the first time Poland’s national carrier has selected Airbus aircraft as part of its fleet modernisation. The agreement which could foresee a future increase to 84 A220 aircraft was announced at the 2025 Paris Air Show.

Michał Fijoł, LOT executive officer, said: “Today’s decision is about the future. The Airbus A220 family aircraft, which will start joining our fleet in 2027, open up new opportunities for development and growth – key pillars of our strategy. These modern, efficient, and passenger-focused aircraft will allow us to compete effectively in the European skies, strengthen our position as the preferred carrier in Central and Eastern Europe, and prepare LOT for its role as a leading airline at the Central Communication Port.”

Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, Airbus EVP sales of the commercial aircraft business, said: “This order for 40 Airbus A220s marks a historic milestone as we officially welcome LOT Polish Airlines into the Airbus family. The A220 Family will be instrumental in LOT's fleet modernisation and network expansion strategy with the A220-100 and A220-300 being the ideal combination for their needs. We look forward to working hand-in-hand with LOT, leveraging Airbus global expertise to support its renewal program and ensure the A220's seamless integration.”

New possibilities

The A220 aircraft will gradually replace the LOT’s existing regional fleet, offering new possibilities for route development and new destinations thanks to the A220 benefits. Combining the longest range, lowest fuel consumption, the A220 is the most modern airliner in its size category, carrying between 100 to 160 passengers on flights of up to 3,600nm. Depending on cabin configuration, the A220-100 serves the 100-135 seat market, while the larger A220-300 is perfectly tailored for the 120-160 seat market.

The A220 is powered by Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation PW1500 GTF engines and offers a 50% smaller noise footprint compared to the previous generation of aircraft.

As with all Airbus aircraft, the A220 is already capable of operating with up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and the companuy is targeting for its aircraft to be 100% SAF capable by 2030. At the end of May 2025, the A220 had secured over 900 firm orders from more than 30 customers worldwide, with over 415 aircraft already delivered, and is currently in successful service with 24 airlines globally, operating on more than 1,600 routes and serving over 470 destinations.

Greece’s Aegean Airlines has unveiled a bold financial strategy by announcing the launch of a Two Hundred Fifty Million Euro bond offering, fully aligned with European Union regulations and Greek financial law. This major initiative reflects the airline’s unwavering confidence in the regional aviation rebound and its aggressive push to modernize its operations, expand its route network, and strengthen its market dominance in the post-pandemic era. The upcoming bond, to be listed on the Athens Exchange, marks a strategic milestone in Aegean’s long-term growth vision—inviting investors to support a high-impact transformation backed by regulatory integrity and strong recovery momentum across Europe.

Aegean Airlines Set to Unveil Bold Two Hundred to Two Hundred Fifty Million Euro Bond Offering to Drive Aviation Comeback and Power Long-Term Expansion

Aegean Airlines has announced its intention to raise significant capital through a new bond issuance, as part of its continued strategy to strengthen its financial structure and support long-term growth. In a formal statement released on Friday, the airline’s Board of Directors confirmed the approval of a common bond loan with a minimum target of two hundred million euros and a maximum ceiling of two hundred fifty million euros. This financial instrument will be made available to investors in Greece through a public offering and is scheduled to be listed on the Athens Exchange’s regulated market, specifically under the Fixed Income Securities Segment.

The move underscores the airline’s ongoing efforts to optimize its capital reserves and secure a more resilient financial foundation in the wake of the aviation industry’s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Once listed, the bonds will provide investors with an opportunity to participate directly in the national carrier’s growth trajectory, as it continues to expand operations and modernize its fleet.

Regulatory and Legal Compliance

The bond issuance will be carried out in full compliance with Greek legal frameworks, particularly Law 4548/2018, which governs corporate operations in Greece, as well as provisions under Law 3156/2003, which pertain to bond loans. In addition, Aegean Airlines is aligning its procedures with European Union regulatory standards, which include EU Regulation 2017/1129, the guiding document for securities prospectuses across the EU. The offering will also follow the rules laid out in Delegated Regulations 2019/979 and 2019/980, ensuring that all necessary investor protections and disclosure obligations are met.

In preparation for the offering, a comprehensive prospectus is being compiled. This document will contain essential information for investors, including the bond structure, maturity period, interest rate, and risk factors. The Hellenic Capital Market Commission (HCMC) is currently reviewing the prospectus. Once approved, it will be made publicly available ahead of the offering to ensure transparency and allow potential investors ample time to review the terms.

Timing and Market Sensitivity

While a definitive timeline has not yet been announced, Aegean has emphasized that the launch and listing of the bonds will be contingent on prevailing market conditions. Volatility in financial markets or geopolitical developments could potentially influence the timing of the public offering. The company has assured investors that it will release updated communications as soon as the HCMC approves the prospectus and listing procedures move forward.

This cautious approach reflects the airline’s focus on ensuring the success of the bond sale, both in terms of attracting institutional investors and setting favorable interest rates. Analysts believe that favorable economic indicators and a recovering travel sector in Southern Europe may boost investor appetite for aviation-related bonds, particularly those issued by a company with a strong domestic presence like Aegean.

Strategic Importance for Aegean Airlines

The capital raised through this bond issuance is expected to play a pivotal role in Aegean’s post-pandemic strategy. Over the past few years, the airline has navigated the turbulent conditions caused by international travel restrictions, decreased passenger volumes, and rising operational costs. Despite these challenges, Aegean managed to maintain operational continuity, partially due to government support and cost optimization strategies.

Now, with international tourism returning to more normalized levels and passenger demand steadily increasing across European routes, Aegean is entering a new phase of expansion and modernization. The funds from the bond offering will likely be channeled into several strategic areas, including:

Fleet renewal and fuel-efficient aircraft acquisitions

Route expansion across Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa

Digital transformation and IT infrastructure upgrades

Sustainability initiatives, such as carbon offset programs and sustainable aviation fuel partnerships

These investments are aligned with Aegean’s broader vision of becoming a more competitive and environmentally conscious carrier, appealing to both leisure and business travelers across the region.

Implications for Investors

The announcement has drawn interest from both institutional and retail investors, particularly within the Greek market. Fixed-income securities issued by a well-established airline with a strong domestic market share are seen as a relatively stable investment, especially in an environment where traditional savings products offer limited returns.

For investors, Aegean’s upcoming bond offers the potential for regular income through interest payments, alongside the security of investing in a publicly listed company with a proven operational history. However, as with any investment in the aviation sector, some risks remain — notably fluctuations in fuel prices, geopolitical tensions, and potential resurgences of global health crises.

Nevertheless, the positive outlook for Mediterranean tourism and the airline’s financial recovery in 2024 suggest a favorable environment for the success of this bond issue.

Aegean Airlines’ move to launch a bond valued between two hundred and two hundred fifty million euros signals its strong belief in the resilience of regional air travel and underscores its bold ambition to position itself at the forefront of Greece’s aviation industry. By securing additional capital through public investment, the airline is positioning itself to respond effectively to changing market demands, enhance operational resilience, and offer shareholders and passengers a stronger, more modernized airline.

Greece’s Aegean Airlines has announced a transformative Two Hundred Fifty Million Euro bond offering, fully compliant with European Union regulations, to fuel its strategic expansion and lead the country’s aviation resurgence. This bold financial move signals confidence in regional air travel and a commitment to long-term growth.

As the final steps toward listing unfold, investors will be closely watching for the release of the prospectus and subsequent offering dates. This financial milestone, if successful, could set a precedent for other regional carriers looking to shore up balance sheets and expand their networks in the evolving landscape of global aviation.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/freepik__the-style-is-candid-image-photography-with-natural__83055-1.jpeg,N,,2025-06-21 14:02:05.219190

Rolls-Royce is proudly marking a major milestone in British engineering excellence as its Trent engine family celebrates 30 years in service.

A symbol of precision, innovation and endurance, the Trent engines have not only redefined the aviation industry but continue to set the gold standard for performance, reliability, and sustainability.

Since the first Trent 700 took flight aboard an Airbus A330 in 1995, the Trent family has grown into the most successful widebody engine programme in aviation history. With over 200 million engine flying hours under its belt, the Trent series has transported 3.5 billion passengers – on holidays, business trips, and humanitarian missions – reaffirming its place at the heart of global air travel.

A Legacy of Engineering Brilliance

Today, the Trent engine family includes the Trent 700, 800, 500, 900, 1000, XWB and 7000. In 2010, there were around 1,500 Trent engines in service. That number has now soared to nearly 6,000, with a Rolls-Royce-powered aircraft taking off or landing somewhere in the world every three seconds.

“At Rolls-Royce, our products are Designed to Last,” the company states. “Our world-class engineers deliver precision, performance and reliability in every component, ensuring our engines perform for our customers for decades to come.”

This success is underpinned by a continuous improvement philosophy. The Trent’s robust three-shaft architecture, a signature of Rolls-Royce design, enables each variant to meet specific thrust requirements while absorbing cutting-edge technologies. Many of these innovations, such as advanced materials and subsystem designs, are also retrofitted into earlier models, ensuring even older engines evolve and improve with time.

As a result, since the first Trent took flight, fuel efficiency has improved by 15%, and reliability has increased eight-fold. The Trent XWB, powering the Airbus A350, is now the world’s most efficient large aero engine in service. All Trent engines are also 100% compatible with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) – accelerating the industry’s path to net-zero flight.

TotalCare: Pioneering Service, Reimagined

The Trent engine’s story of success is also a story of unmatched service. Rolls-Royce revolutionised aftercare with TotalCare – a programme introduced shortly after the first Trent entered service. TotalCare links support to engine flying hours, offering airlines both predictability and peace of mind.

This approach evolved into the CareStore, a full suite of services that support the engine throughout its life cycle, serving not only airlines but freight operators and lessors. With a sharp focus on fleet insights and digital health monitoring, Rolls-Royce now delivers 99% dispatch reliability, helping customers eliminate unexpected disruptions.

British Innovation: A Proud Heritage

Rolls-Royce’s engineering journey began at the Midland Hotel in Manchester, and its legacy is etched with aviation firsts. From the Conway – the world’s first bypass gas turbine engine – to powering the first transatlantic passenger flight using 100% SAF with the Trent 1000 on a Boeing 787 in 2023, the company has continually pushed boundaries.

With pioneering innovations like the wide-chord hollow titanium fan blades and the versatile three-shaft architecture, Rolls-Royce has equipped the Trent family with unmatched durability and global reach. The Trent XWB is set to add another chapter by powering the longest non-stop passenger flight from London to Sydney.

Designed to Last: Powered by People

At the core of Rolls-Royce’s success is its people – past, present, and future. Generations of engineers have dedicated their careers to building and maintaining the Trent legacy. With graduate and apprenticeship programmes thriving, the company is ensuring the continuation of its tradition of excellence.

“Many of our engineers enjoy decades-long careers at Rolls-Royce, and three generations of employees can be found throughout the organisation,” the company proudly affirms.

Investing in Tomorrow

The Trent story is far from over. Rolls-Royce is investing over £1 billion in engine upgrades, including a Durability Enhancement package for the Trent 1000 and 7000, which more than doubles the engine’s time on wing.

Looking ahead, the UltraFan demonstrator – the largest jet engine ever built – is being developed with sustainability at its core. Ready to run on 100% SAF from day one, UltraFan combines new technologies to deliver even greater fuel efficiency and lower emissions.

As Rolls-Royce looks to the next 30 years and beyond, the message is clear: the Trent engine family isn’t just made in Britain – it’s made to last.",https://i0.wp.com/conservativepost.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rolls-Royce-UltraFan-engine.jpg?fit=1800%2C1013&ssl=1,N,,2025-06-21 12:09:27.550179

Will The A350-1000 Ever Surpass The -900 In Orders?

The Airbus A350 has surpassed 1,400 orders at the Paris Air Show this week. More than 1,000 of those are for the A350-900, which has historically out-sold its stretched stablemate, the A350-1000, by a factor of 3-to-1. But something has changed in 2025. The -1000 has picked up 87 orders so far this year, spurred on by the new commitments in Paris from Riyadh Air and STARLUX. By contrast, the -900 has just 18 orders year-to-date. The -1000 obviously offers advantages in terms of range and capacity (particularly ahead of the wing for premium passengers), but also comes with a higher price tag. But are airlines now willing to pay that extra for the chance to boost their premium seating capacity and the associated revenues? Which begs the question: Will the A350-1000 ever surpass the -900 in total orders?

A220-500: Which Airlines Will Be First In Line?

Airbus has confirmed that it expects to complete its feasibility studies for a stretched A220, informally known as the A220-500, by the end of the year. Assuming it goes ahead with the aircraft, this would see it enter service in the early 2030s. The aircraft would be larger than the current A220-300, with the ability to seat an estimated 160–170 passengers, roughly the same size as a Boeing MAX 8 or A320neo. However, with a clean sheet design and potentially new engine options, the aircraft could likely offer significant efficiency advantages over rivals. Existing A220 customers like Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Air France, and Breeze Airways have all expressed interest in a stretched version of the A220. But what do you think?

Should JSX Acquire Silver Airways' Former ATR Planes?

American air carrier JSX recently announced a surprising purchase of some brand-new ATR turboprop planes, despite turboprops not being a popular choice for most airlines in the US. Not only does this mark the first time JSX will operate turboprop planes, but it serves as a rebound for American turboprop passenger service after a very short time span due to one airline ceasing operations just a few days ago. On June 11th, Silver Airways, a regional airline serving most of Florida and the Caribbean, ceased operations. Before its closure, it was one of the only American carriers to operate turboprop flights. With Silver's closure, this leaves its eight ATR planes up for grabs. Considering that JSX is now venturing into turboprop service, should it acquire Silver Airways' former ATR planes? Share your thoughts in the comments! This is user-generated content.

The new aircraft are destined to replace LOT's Embraer-based regional fleet, where it currently operates a total of 44 Embraer ERJ-170/175/190/195 aircraft. It was widely expected that LOT would simply upgrade its regional fleet to the next-generation Embraer E2 series. The Brazilian manufacturer was the incumbent, and had the installed base of Embraer pilots and maintenance operations, and LOT has no prior relationship with Airbus.

Could A Pan Am Revival Take On The 'Big Three' Middle Eastern Airlines?

Pan Am is one of the most recognizable airline brands in history, and was a staple of pop culture and aviation as a whole. However, all the glamour faded away due to competition and financial problems, ultimately leading to its closure in late 1991. However, nearly 34 years after it closed down, Pan Am has returned to the skies (albeit as a short private charter flight) for an around-the-world journey priced at nearly $60,000 per person. Even though this is only a temporary return of the Pan Am name on a plane, it makes me wonder if a proper revival of regularly scheduled Clipper flights could be a possibility. Pan Am has always been known for its supreme luxury compared to other airlines of its time. Throughout its peak (the 1950s to the 1970s), Pan Am revolutionized the way we view air travel forever. From transatlantic service to luxurious services, the airline was truly a trailblazer. A modern comparison would be the Middle East's 'Big Three' (Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Etihad)

The largest aircraft built to date by the Boeing Company has been the Boeing 747-8, a modern version of its decades-old Boeing 747 design. When the 747 entered passenger service around the globe, it fundamentally revolutionized air travel by reducing operating costs to the point that airlines could really open up air travel to the masses. These long-haul jets could fly halfway around the globe and carry hundreds of passengers. Nonetheless, the market for inefficient four-engine aircraft slowly began to shrink over the years, so the airline's sales performance for the Boeing 747-8 was undoubtedly lackluster. Nonetheless, the carrier was able to continue competing with Airbus' A380 offering. This all bodes an interesting question: was it smart for Boeing to build the 747-8?

What Do You Make Of Emirates' Desire To Expand Its Indian Network?

Over the past two years, Emirates has looked to nearly double its seat capacity into India, after its bilateral agreements were used up completely, preventing any more services into the nation. Emirates has a desire to spread its services to tier two cities such as Amritsar and Goa, which both have Qatar Airways services, whilst Air India operates Amritsar to Gatwick and Birmingham. Goa maintains seasonal TUI connections to Manchester. The question is whether India will increase its bilateral rights with Dubai. The likely answer for now is no, as the Indian Government is reluctant to decrease Air India's international market share. Emirates' increased presence would allow competition, more options for travellers, and cheaper fares. The arrival of the A350 and 787s in the coming years could fuel Emirates' persistence to grow and capitalise on the Indian market. Alternatively, its sister company FlyDubai could be used to operate smaller aircraft such as the 737 MAX 8 into cities like C

Should More Airlines Outside The US Order The Embraer E175?

Despite having a successor already developed, the first-generation Embraer E175 is still receiving orders, mainly from the US. This is due to a pilot scope clause that forced US regional airlines to choose specific planes that are approved for use. That means planes such as the larger and more advanced E2 cannot join the US regional lineup. Because of that, the 1st generation E175 remains in production to benefit US regional airlines, albeit with slight modifications for improved efficiency, practicality, and comfort. It seems that the program will likely not go away anytime soon, as SkyWest, the largest regional airline in North America, recently announced a massive order for more E175s at the 2025 Paris Air Show. However, it seems that SkyWest is the only one who is keeping the E175 program in the air. This makes me wonder if other airlines outside the US can make use of the E175. While the E2 generation has more benefits, the E175 is not far behind. Plus, it is cheaper than a new

Can United Airlines’ Push For Sustainable Aviation Fuel Reshape The Industry?

United Airlines has committed to a bold goal: to use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for 100% of its domestic flights by 2035. This effort is part of a larger plan to dramatically reduce the airline’s carbon footprint and push the aviation industry toward net-zero emissions. SAF is made from renewable resources like agricultural waste, algae, or recycled cooking oil, and it can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. For airlines, it offers one of the few immediate options to cut greenhouse gases without sacrificing flight range or performance. However, the scale of this transition poses serious questions about feasibility. Is SAF production capacity and supply chain ready to meet the demands of a major carrier like United within the next decade? Will the costs of SAF remain prohibitively high compared to conventional jet fuel, potentially affecting ticket prices? There’s also the question of whether other airlines will be able to follow Unite

Which Canceled Route Do You Wish You Could Have Flown On?

Over the years, various different routes have come and gone from carriers' networks, as travel demand and market conditions dictate changes in airline strategy. This means that there are many corridors today that used to be served, but no longer see connections provided by scheduled commercial flights.

Operated by Sun Air using Dornier 328JET regional aircraft, these flights primarily shuttled Astra Zeneca employees across the North Sea, but, for several years, members of the public could also buy a certain number of seats.

What Are Your Best Hacks For Making Low-Cost Air Travel More Bearable?

Many people love to hate low-cost air travel, with the perceived gulf in service compared to legacy operators being an easy stick with which to beat such carriers. However, a few little tips and tricks here and there can go a long way in making budget airlines a perfectly serviceable way of getting from A to B, even (or maybe especially) if such hacks aren't widely known. Personally, my top tip concerns the seating onboard the Boeing 737-800 and MAX 8-200 aircraft at Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair. Specifically, as confirmed by aeroLOPA, seats on the DEF side of the aisle in the front half of the cabin (rows 3-15 on the 737-800 and 3-16 on the 737 MAX 8-200) offer half an inch more legroom compared to their counterparts on the ABC side. While not a major difference, it can play a key role in enhancing comfort for taller travelers - as someone whose height is four inches taller than the average UK male, it definitely helps me!

Virgin Atlantic vs. British Airways: Which Carrier Do You Prefer For Long-Haul Travel?

There are dozens of carriers operating flights across the North Atlantic each night, but two of the most noteworthy are British Airways and Virgin Atlantic. These two airlines have continued to compete over the years to be the dominant player in the United Kingdom's long-haul travel market, and both have jostled for control at major hubs like London Heathrow Airport (LHR). With each carrier having its own independent partnerships with US-based legacy airlines, each of these carriers has its network, and you could very much end up on either of these airlines on your next flight to London. But which of these two carriers do you prefer for long-haul travel? For me, it is probably Virgin Atlantic due to their excellent service and emphasis on passenger comfort.

IN THIS REPORT

Christchurch Airport wants to become the world’s first truly “green” airport, challenging the aviation industry’s high-carbon reputation.

The airport has already cut its direct operational emissions by 92 percent compared to a decade ago through innovations like geothermal heating.

Now it’s tackling the much larger problem of aircraft emissions by preparing for electric planes, green hydrogen, and sustainable aviation fuel. But will it work?

Can an airport be sustainable?

Before you answer that question, step outside any terminal and catch a whiff of burning jet fuel — a searing, earthy odor that reminds you air travel is one of the most carbon-intensive industries on the planet.

But Christchurch Airport, a small aviation hub on New Zealand’s sparsely populated South Island, is determined to flip the script. Over the past two decades, the airport has quietly tried to transform itself into a sustainability innovator — and prove that even in an industry notorious for its environmental impact, meaningful change is possible.

“It’s a challenge,” says Claire Waghorn, the airport’s sustainability transition leader. “But we must rise to the challenge.”

Christchurch Airport has already slashed its operational emissions by 92 percent from a decade ago. Now it’s tackling the far greater challenge of reducing aircraft emissions. While the path to sustainability is fraught with challenges and occasional missteps, Christchurch Airport’s progress offers a possible blueprint for how airports — and perhaps entire industries — can reimagine their environmental impact.

A sustainability journey rooted in indigenous wisdom

Christchurch Airport’s approach to sustainability is deeply influenced by Māori principles, particularly the concept of kaitiakitanga, or guardianship.

“It’s about recognizing that everything is interconnected,” Waghorn explains. “We can’t address climate change in isolation. We have to consider biodiversity, social equity, and economic resilience as part of the same puzzle. Alongside this, understanding we need to act with intergenerational interests at heart.”

This holistic philosophy is reflected in the airport’s use of the “doughnut economics” framework, which balances environmental limits (the outer ring of the doughnut) with social minimum standards (the inner ring). The goal is to operate within these boundaries and ensure that the airport’s operations are not at the expense of the planet.

Cutting emissions: Down 92 percent and counting

Christchurch Airport’s sustainability journey began in 2006, long before most airports were even thinking about carbon footprints. Back then, their emissions tracking was rudimentary, but it laid the groundwork for what would become one of the most ambitious decarbonization plans in the aviation industry.

By 2015, the airport had a clear road map in place. Since then, it has reduced its operational emissions by 92 percent. How did they do it?

Ground source heat pumps. In a world-first engineering feat, the airport tapped into aquifers deep beneath the terminal to create a geothermal heating and cooling system. This innovation allowed it to ditch diesel generators and slash emissions.

Electric ground power units. Planes can plug into clean electricity while parked at the gate, eliminating the need for jet fuel-powered auxiliary engines. The electricity comes from green sources, too.

Electric fire trucks. After years of negotiating with manufacturers, the airport is transitioning its firefighting fleet to electric vehicles.

Automated energy management. A smart building system ensures lights and HVAC systems are only active when needed, cutting energy waste.

Your Voice Matters

“We’ve got this little bit left on our own plate,” Waghorn said, referring to the remaining 8 percent of emissions. “It’s things like backup generators and fire extinguishers — tiny amounts that are surprisingly hard to eliminate.”

The elephant on the runway: aircraft emissions

While Christchurch Airport has made steady progress in reducing its own emissions, it’s quick to acknowledge the bigger challenge: aircraft emissions.

“Our operational footprint is around 240 tons per year,” Waghorn noted. “The airlines? Eight hundred thousand tons.”

To address this, the airport is positioning itself as a pioneer in the transition to low-carbon aviation. Its strategy focuses on three key technologies:

Electric planes. For short-haul regional flights, electric aircraft are already being tested. Christchurch Airport welcomed ElectricAir onsite in 2020, and is working to ensure infrastructure will adequately support electric aviation needs.

Green hydrogen. For domestic and medium-haul international flights, the airport formed the H2 in Aviation Consortium and is investigating hydrogen infrastructure, including liquefaction and refueling facilities.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). For long-haul flights, SAF — made from biofuels or green hydrogen with captured carbon — offers a promising, if still limited, solution.

“Airlines sign contracts for new planes three to four years before delivery,” says Waghorn, “but the infrastructure to support them takes seven to eight years to build. It’s very challenging. We have to act now, even without certainty about which technologies will dominate.”

A circular economy approach

Sustainability at Christchurch Airport isn’t just about cutting emissions. It’s also about biodiversity, water conservation, energy efficiency, and rethinking waste. The airport has implemented a robust circular economy program, focusing on materials recovery and reducing single-use plastics.

One standout initiative is its waste sorting system. The airport collects everything and sorts it back of house offsite. The results have been staggering: half of what was once considered general waste is now diverted to recycling or composting streams.

“We’ve also partnered with local organizations to repurpose food waste from our lounges,” Waghorn added. “It’s about finding the best possible outcome for every item that comes through our terminal.”

Challenges — and skepticism

Despite the progress, Christchurch Airport faces its share of challenges and skeptics. For one, sustainability efforts often go unnoticed by passengers.

“A lot of this work happens behind the scenes,” Waghorn acknowledges. “It’s not as tangible as, say, a solar panel or a wind turbine.”

Sustainability is not entirely invisible. For example, you might see the airport’s solar farm when you taxi for takeoff — it’s being built on the southwestern side of the airport. And you might notice electric buses shuttling passengers around the airport and into the city.

There have been a few missteps. The airport’s attempt to replace milk bottles with milk kegs failed because of timing and fluctuations in milk use.

Christchurch Airport’s sustainability journey is far from over. With a goal of achieving absolute zero emissions in airport operations by 2035 — no offsets, just real reductions — the facility is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in airports, while continuing to explore how to support and accelerate the wider aviation transition.

“It’s really, really hard to get consistent behavior from a transient crowd,” says Waghhorn.

Some of the missteps are funny, in hindsight. Consider the airport’s purchase of an electric autonomous shuttle in 2017. Although the shuttle was a bold step toward modernizing airport transportation, it could not be used on the road because it wasn’t street-legal.

“We learned so much from that,” laughs Waghorn. The airport quietly sold the shuttle and transitioned to an electric van driven by a human.

Pro Tip

The airport’s experiences suggest that the path to sustainability is almost never linear. The airport has had to adapt, learn from its errors, and stay focused on the bigger picture, even when faced with setbacks and skepticism.

“We always have to keep trying to do more,” she says.

A model for the future?

Christchurch Airport’s sustainability journey is far from over. With a goal of achieving absolute zero emissions by 2035 — no offsets, just real reductions — the facility is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in airports.

But perhaps its greatest contribution lies in its willingness to share its successes — and failures.

“Collaboration is everything,” Waghorn says. “We can’t do this alone. It’s about working with airports, airlines, manufacturers, energy providers, and communities to create a shared vision for the future.”

For travelers, Christchurch Airport offers a glimmer of hope. It’s proof that even in an industry as carbon-intensive as aviation, sustainability is not just a buzzword. It’s a tangible, achievable goal. And while the road ahead is long and filled with pitfalls, the airport’s progress serves as a reminder that every step, no matter how small, may bring us closer to a sustainable future.

FAQs

How to spot a genuinely ‘green’ airport

Check for a Sustainability Report — Before you book, visit the airport’s website. Genuinely committed airports publish detailed, data-driven sustainability reports with clear targets, not just glossy marketing pages.

Observe Ground Transportation — When you arrive, look at the shuttle and bus services. Widespread use of electric vehicles for passenger transport and ground operations is a strong, visible sign of commitment.

Inspect Terminal Facilities — Notice the details inside. Look for water refill stations to reduce plastic use, clear signage for comprehensive waste sorting (recycling, compost), and energy-saving lighting like LEDs.

Look for Action at the Gate — Check if parked aircraft are connected to electric ground power units. This allows them to shut down their noisy, jet fuel-powered auxiliary engines, significantly cutting emissions.

See if They Support Future Fuels — Check the airport’s news for partnerships related to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), green hydrogen, or electric aircraft charging. Proactive support for these technologies shows a true long-term vision.

The Minnesota Farmers Union recently opened a meat processing plant in Staples where students will be able to train, added the commissioner.","WILLMAR — Agriculture continued to receive bipartisan support in the state legislature, leading Minnesota Department of Agriculture Commissioner Thom Petersen to offer an upbeat assessment of the recent legislative session.

With a split Legislature —101 DFL’ers and 100 Republicans — the session went about as well as Petersen believed it could, he told an audience that filled the Life Sciences auditorium of the MinnWest Technology Campus in Willmar, where the annual Partners in Ag Innovation conference was conducted Tuesday.

The agriculture bill was the first approved, Petersen said, and it addressed priority issues for agriculture.

The Legislature approved replenishing the emergency account for responding to the highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak affecting the state’s poultry and dairy industries, according to the commissioner.

The agriculture bill included funding for the development of 100 weather station sites across the state, an initiative supported by the state’s corn growers, according to the commissioner.

The new legislation continues to offer incentives for the development of the sustainable aviation fuel industry in Minnesota, but some of what Petersen termed the “bigger pieces,” or tax credits, were dropped out of the final bill.

The commissioner is optimistic about the state’s prospects for becoming a leading producer of plant-based fuel for the aviation industry. “We’re right on the cusp of getting this,” he said.

Petersen said he expects that corn will initially be the primary feedstock for the fuel production, as development continues on other possible crops. Minnesota raises corn on roughly 8 million acres, making it the state’s largest crop.

“Corn is going to be in the mix,” Petersen said.

The University of Minnesota’s Forever Green Initiative has been researching the use of winter camelina and pennycress as potential feedstocks for sustainable aviation fuel.

The Legislature approved continuing to provide grant funds to help retail service stations install the infrastructure for E15 and higher ethanol blends.

Petersen also pointed to continued state support for developing more small meat processing operations across the state. Minnesota livestock producers were among the hardest hit when the COVID pandemic led to closures and cutbacks in production at large meat processors.

At one point, pork producers in the state had 30,000 hogs a day backing up with no place to deliver the animals for processing, he pointed out.

In response, the state has helped support meat processing programs at post-secondary educational facilities, including Ridgewater College. The Minnesota Farmers Union recently opened a meat processing plant in Staples where students will be able to train, added the commissioner.

Petersen also cited the importance of work to help young people get into farming.

“Fifty percent of the farmland in Minnesota is going to change hands in the next 20 years,” he said.

The commissioner would like to see more funding for the beginning farmer tax credit. Funding for it was decreased while eligibility for the tax credit it provides on land and equipment purchases was expanded to allow more participants. As a result, the department is now only able to fund 62% of the requests for the credit, according to the commissioner.

Petersen said the state is one of the few actually adding farms. The new farmers are people raising livestock and produce for local markets.

They are typically operating in areas such as his home county of Pine, where there is access to smaller parcels of land that are more affordable. In locations such as Kandiyohi County, it’s virtually impossible to start a 1,000-acre operation unless taking over as part of a family operation, he said.

Asked about the situation for undocumented workers, Petersen said he is regularly taking calls from large entities — everything from landscapers and horse racing tracks to dairy and pork producers — concerned about it. He said the Agriculture Department is working with the Attorney General’s Office on the issues.

Most of the foreign workers in Minnesota are here under the H-2A visa program, which allows for temporary employment.

“Many of these workers come every year, same families, farms, businesses. Very important for our whole sector,” said the commissioner.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/466b1cc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3872x2592+0+0/resize/1592x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2a%2F0b%2F2460475c4de7bafd526a0b386fe0%2Fdsc-0028.JPG,N,,2025-06-21 09:01:46.568810

Based on reference prices released earlier this year by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, the minimum penalty should be around €13,922 per tonne.
Germany’s proposed fine of €17,000 would be significantly higher than this minimum and could be adjusted in the future.

The proposed fine, revealed in a draft seen by Argus, is aimed at enforcing compliance with upcoming EU rules that require a growing share of hydrogen-based fuels in aviation, reports Argus.

The EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation will require fuel suppliers to begin blending e-SAF starting in 2030. From 2030 to 2031, at least 1.2% of the total aviation fuel supply must be e-SAF on average, with a minimum of 0.7% each year. The blending requirement will increase over time — reaching 2% in 2032, 5% in 2035, and eventually 35% by 2050.

The EU mandates that national penalties for non-compliance be set at no less than twice the price difference between e-SAF and conventional jet fuel. Based on reference prices released earlier this year by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, the minimum penalty should be around €13,922 per tonne. Germany’s proposed fine of €17,000 would be significantly higher than this minimum and could be adjusted in the future.

E-SAF is made using renewable or low-carbon hydrogen, including hydrogen produced via nuclear-powered electrolysis. While the direct use of hydrogen in aviation is also permitted under EU legislation, this is widely regarded as a longer-term solution.

Germany had previously considered setting its own national e-SAF targets but abandoned those plans following the adoption of the EU-wide rules.

Most e-SAF projects in Europe and beyond are still in early stages of development. Industry stakeholders have long called for clearer regulations, especially around penalties and incentives, to help secure final investment decisions and scale up production.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-5.png,N,,2025-06-21 09:01:53.904929

In a historic statement at the 55th International Paris Air Show, Air France-KLM and Groupe ADP, in conjunction with the French government, unveiled their ambitious “Connect France” vision.

With French President Emmanuel Macron, Air France-KLM Group CEO Benjamin Smith, and Groupe ADP Chairman and CEO Philippe Pascal affirmed an alliance to enhance global connectivity to France and to position Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) as the world’s leading aviation hub.

A Unified Vision for the Future of French Aviation

The “Connect France” initiative arises from a mutual understanding of the current global aviation challenges. The geopolitical climate, paired with escalating competition from non-European players, has made it crucial to enhance the synergy between Air France and Groupe ADP. The goal is to strengthen the operational efficiency and competitiveness of Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, ensuring its place as a global leader in air travel.

The new collaboration brings together two pillars of France’s aviation infrastructure—Air France, a leading international airline, and Groupe ADP, the operator of Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport. Together, they employ over 870,000 people in direct and indirect roles across France, with the airport playing a pivotal role in France’s economy. With 11% of the nation’s export value flowing through CDG, the initiative is a strategic move to safeguard France’s economic and political sovereignty in aviation.

Facing Fierce Competition and Securing France’s Aviation Future

While France remains the world’s top tourist destination, its aviation services are gradually shifting to foreign hands. Airports in neighboring European nations, benefiting from more attractive fiscal and regulatory frameworks, are diverting traffic that previously passed through France. The growing trend of “silent offshoring” poses a direct threat to the dominance of Paris-Charles de Gaulle, and “Connect France” aims to address this gap by ensuring France’s aviation industry can thrive in a competitive environment.

Benjamin Smith, CEO of Air France-KLM, emphasized the need for closer collaboration to face this growing competition, particularly from non-European airlines. “With ‘Connect France,’ we are formalizing the approach needed to protect France’s aviation infrastructure, boost connectivity, and continue to provide high-quality service to our passengers,” Smith stated.

Philippe Pascal, Chairman of Groupe ADP, highlighted that this partnership will also focus on enhancing the passenger experience and promoting France’s distinctive cultural offerings to the world. “Paris-Charles de Gaulle is an essential asset for the country, and by capitalizing on the synergies between Air France and Groupe ADP, we will create a competitive edge that cannot be matched by other airports.”

Key Initiatives and Timeline for Progress

The ambitious “Connect France” partnership is focused on a set of key initiatives designed to improve the air travel experience for passengers, enhance operational performance, and meet sustainability goals. These initiatives will be rolled out in phases over the next few years.

Improved Passenger Experience

One of the standout features of the partnership is the introduction of a “short connection pass” for passengers with tight layovers. This initiative will streamline the journey for connecting passengers, offering dedicated pathways and prioritized screening. The system will be fully operational by Summer 2025, ensuring smoother transfers and shorter waiting times for travelers.

Optimizing Airport Operations

Air France and Groupe ADP are focused on optimizing the operations at Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, with a goal of increasing the wide-body aircraft contact rate to 95% at peak times by 2026. This will reduce bus transfers for passengers and enhance operational capacity, particularly during high-traffic periods.

Terminal Enhancements and Naming Strategy

By 2026, CDG’s terminals will undergo a redesign to improve passenger flow and navigation. Clearer signage and better wayfinding will be implemented, aligning with international standards to provide a smoother travel experience. Additionally, a new joint stopover offering will showcase the best of Paris, offering passengers connecting through CDG an opportunity to explore the city during layovers.

Sustainability Goals and SAF Development

Sustainability remains a core focus of the initiative. Air France is already one of the largest global buyers of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and Groupe ADP is committed to providing low-carbon energy solutions at CDG. Together, they plan to push the envelope on SAF production in Europe, with an announcement expected by the end of 2025 on new projects and collaborations to bolster SAF infrastructure.

Creating a “Flagship France” Experience

As part of the broader vision, Groupe ADP aims to make CDG’s second Hall K the benchmark for French excellence. This terminal will feature the best in French culture, gastronomy, and fashion, offering a unique and luxurious travel experience for passengers.

Strengthening France’s Global Aviation Leadership

Until 2026, the consortium’s programs will reshape Paris-Charles de Gaulle’s international reputation for air leadership. Backed by the French government, the “Connect France” program signals that an overall national strategy is needed to sustain France’s competitive edge in global air transport.

It is not only aimed at increasing performance indicators but also at increasing international recognition for France as an air travel leader. In partnership between Groupe ADP, Air France, and public authorities, “Connect France” will transform Paris-Charles de Gaulle into one world-class airport hub.

This statement by Benjamin Smith is typical of this shift’s strategic imperatives: “This isn’t about competition; it’s about keeping France ahead of the curve in terms of industry, providing one-of-a-kind experiences to international travelers.”

The full information on the “Connect France” program, including progress in specific projects and the actual timeline for rollout, will be made available at intervals in the coming months as the partnership proceeds towards targets.

Our close collaboration with travel agencies allows us to offer personalized products, such as the recently introduced Premium Economy, which responds to the demand for upgraded yet affordable travel options.

At the same time, we maintain close cooperation with the Greek National Tourism Organization and AEGEAN. The codeshare agreement with AEGEAN has allowed us to expand connectivity to 8 additional Greek destinations beyond Athens, supporting inbound tourism and regional development.

Emirates reaffirms its long-term commitment to Greece by maintaining daily flights throughout the year, while adding a second daily flight to the Athens-Dubai route for the summer of 2025, to meet growing demand. At the same time, the travel industry is contributing significantly to maintaining high occupancy rates on the Athens-New York (Newark) route, which has shown steady growth since its launch in 2017.

-How do you see the Greeks' response to the Premium Economy and Business Class products, which mark growing popularity? Do you record any noticeable changes in their preferences after the pandemic?

Greek travelers show increasing interest in the premium Economy and Business Class positions, looking for more comfort, quality services, and flexibility, and we are very happy that the upgraded Boeing 777 with the addition of Premium Economy has now joined the Athens route. We record a steady increase in demand, and we are particularly pleased with the upward trend of bookings, as well as the particularly positive comments we have received. Market response is extremely positive, especially from travelers looking for upgraded services at a more affordable cost.

Current tendencies in bookings confirm that the new offer fills a strategic gap and meets the needs of both the public traveling and leisure. After all, Business Class continues to be particularly preferred by professional and frequent travelers, mainly on long-distance routes, such as transatlantic.

After the pandemic, we observe a clear shift to travel preferences, with more and more travelers choosing upgraded flight experiences and investing in them. We record strong performance on our routes to and from Greece, with passenger traffic increasing about 19% on an annual basis. The strong demand for higher travel experiences enhances Emirates' continued investment in premium products, tailored to the changing needs of the Greek market.

- Sustainability is becoming increasingly important in the travel industry. What initiatives does Emirates apply to reduce its environmental footprint, and how are they communicated to your partners and passengers in Greece?

Sustainability is a top priority for Emirates, which continues to actively invest in initiatives that reduce its environmental footprint and promote social responsibility. Emirates's viability policy is based on three main pillars: reducing emissions, responsible resource management, and protecting wildlife and natural ecosystems.

In recent years, we have made significant steps in this direction, with positive results that benefit, among other things, the Greek market and our partners. Specifically, Emirates supports active initiatives promoting the adoption of Sustainable Air Force (SAF). In November 2024, we announced an agreement with Shell Aviation on the supply of more than 300,000 gallons of mixed SAF, which will be used in our center in Dubai. In addition, in October 2023, we expanded our cooperation with Neste to supply more than 3 million SAF gallons in the years 2024 and 2025, for Emirates flights departing from Amsterdam's Schiphol airport and Changi.

In January 2023, we successfully completed a Boeing 777 demonstration flight, in which one of the engines used 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). In addition, in November 2023, Emirates became the first airline in the world to air a Demo with an A380 aircraft, using a 100% SAF.

In May 2023, we announced the creation of a $ 200 million fund for the financing of research and development projects (R&D) with the aim of advanced fuel and energy solutions in aviation. This is the largest individual commitment to viability by an airline. In 2024, it became the first funding for the Aviation Impact Accelerator of Cambridge University, while additional projects are expected.

In January 2024, Emirates became the first international airline to join the Solent Cluster, a UK initiative to focus on low-carbon investments aimed at reducing CO2 emissions.

In 2024, we transferred for the first time 3,000 metric tons of Sustainable Air Force (SAF) from London's Heathrow Airport.

Emirates is a founding member of the Aircraft Research Cooperative in the United Arab Emirates, which focuses on the development, production, and escalation of sustainable air fuel technologies.

In June 2024, Emirates became the first international airline to join AIREG (AVIATIative for Renewable Energy in Germany), committing a commitment to boost local SAF production in Germany.

We continue to operate with modern and efficient fuel aircraft, a key element of our business model since our founding. Recently, we added the A350 to our fleet, the most fuel-efficient aircraft in the world. Emirates regularly informs its associates and passengers in Greece about viability initiatives through updates, advertising campaigns, information, and collaborative events with local agencies.

- Looking back in the future, are there new developments or investments, such as increased flight frequencies, new partnerships, or upgrading of services, should Greek tourism professionals should know?

Emirates is continuing its investment trend in strategic markets, such as Greece, constantly introducing new services and upgraded products that enhance the travel experience.

Specifically, it proceeds to the following actions ...

Continuous growth and investment in basic markets, such as Greece, through the introduction of new services and upgraded products.

Fleet extension and aircraft upgrade (upgraded Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 with four-seater configuration, introduction of the Premium Economy category, receipt of the rest of the A350).

Strengthening partnerships and expansion of the flight network: Emirates has worked with the Hellenic Tourism Organization (EOT) to boost tourism in Greece, emphasizing basic markets such as the US, the UAE, Australia, India, and China. In addition, Emirates' joint code agreement with Aegean expands connectivity to eight internal destinations in Greece. Emirates also performs a daily flight between Dubai and Athens, further enhancing its global network and supporting the development of tourism in Greece.

Commitment to sustainability.

Improving the experience of new technologies (free Wi-Fi for Skywards members in all cabins, enhancing connectivity), upgraded ground services (Premium passengers enjoy driver transport and access to 34+ exclusive airlines at airports worldwide and airports) ""Ice"" offers over 6,500 channels, including exclusive content from Paramount+, HBO Max, Discovery+, BBC and Bloomberg Originals)

-Are there any plans to expand the Emirates network with new itineraries or increased frequencies that will benefit the Greek market, either directly or through connective hubs?

Emirates is constantly looking for opportunities to expand its network and enhance the frequencies of its flights, depending on demand. We are constantly evaluating our activity in the Greek market, in close cooperation with the competent authorities, in order to identify opportunities for further development.

We remain committed to the Greek market, with the aim of contributing positively to the local economy, society, and the environment. Our goal is to maintain the capacity of our presence, offering travelers from Greece access to even more destinations in our world network via Dubai - and beyond that - in areas such as the Middle East, Australia, Asia, and Africa.

We have also reached an agreement with Aegean Codeshare, offering passengers enhanced connectivity to 8 Greek destinations via Athens, with a single ticket. As part of the collaboration, Emirates places its code on selected Aegean flights, ensuring a smooth detention experience and a single luggage policy to popular destinations such as Corfu, Chania, Heraklion, Mykonos, Santorini, Rhodes, Thessaloniki and Thessaloniki. Correspondingly, Aegean places its own code on Emirates' flights between Athens and Dubai, facilitating connections to the Emirates global network.

In addition, from June 1st to October 25, 2025, an additional daily flight was added to the Athens -Dubai line.

The transportation sector becomes more electrified in accordance with the energy transition to renewable energy. However, aviation is challenging to decarbonize due to low energy density of batteries. Specifically, it is difficult to store large-scale batteries in aircraft because there are stringent limitations in weight and space. Therefore, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) should serve as a bridge to battery-powered aircraft until the battery technology matures to lower transportation-related carbon emissions. It is imperative to produce SAF in a techno-economically feasible manner. Nevertheless, the successful commercialization of SAF is being hampered by the shortcomings of the SAF production processes, such as low efficiencies. Therefore, a co-production strategy is employed to build a new process addressing uncompetitive economics and low carbon efficiency of the SAF production process. The developed process co-produces valuable biochemicals, adipic acid and furfural, with butene oligomer (i.e., SAF) using lignocellulosic biomass. In this paper, comprehensive evaluations including tech-economic analysis and life-cycle assessment are conducted to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed process. The findings reveal that the proposed approach not only improves the process economics by approximately 2.7%, but also significantly enhances the environmental sustainability of the process, achieving a reduction of 15.75 kg CO2 eq/kg SAF.",https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/persistent/pubmed-meta-image-v2.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 10:00:23.403857

Indonesia, a member of several biofuels initiatives, recently accepted India’s Global Biofuels Alliance invitation, emphasizing biofuels' growing role in international cooperation.","Biofuels are an increasingly indispensable complement to electrification and energy efficiency strategies in the global energy transition, particularly for the Global South. With fossil fuels projected to remain critical for transportation in developing economies, biofuels offer a lower-carbon alternative that is compatible with current vehicular technologies, but also capable of decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and shipping. Their compatibility with existing infrastructure, reliance on locally available feedstocks, and potential to enhance rural livelihoods underscore their relevance for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, energy security, and inclusive development.

Yet significant challenges remain. The cost gap between biofuels and fossil fuels persists, particularly for advanced fuels like biojet and biomethane. Feedstock sustainability poses another constraint: expansion may conflict with food security, biodiversity, and land-use goals. Innovation remains underfunded, especially in second- and third-generation biofuels, and finance for large-scale deployment is unevenly distributed.

To address these barriers, the paper recommends three priorities: (i) expanding integrated policy frameworks that include blending mandates and sustainability certifications; (ii) accelerating technological innovation through R&D investments and public-private partnerships; and (iii) strengthening global cooperation and cross-learning, particularly through platforms like the Global Biofuels Alliance. These actions are essential to aligning biofuel deployment with net zero goals and advancing a just, resilient energy transition.

I. INTRODUCTION

Biofuels are increasingly regarded as vital to the process of energy transition, especially in the countries of the Global South. With a growing urban population, the energy demand from household consumption and transportation will increase significantly in the foreseeable future. Even with the share of renewable energy from solar, wind, hydrogen, and geothermal sources rising over time, fossil fuels will continue to remain an essential part of the energy mix, especially for the transportation sector in developing countries.

Biofuels offer an alternative to reduce the carbon intensity of energy demand both in the short and long run. They can have a lower carbon footprint than fossil fuels and can significantly decarbonize transportation, especially in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation. Biofuels are highly adaptable and compatible with existing infrastructure, can use residues from agriculture, and offer additional sources of income for rural communities. Finally, several countries such as Brazil and India have existing policies to increase the use of biofuels and to enhance production capacity to meet the demand for biofuels. Over time, global collaboration and investment in new technologies have the potential to accelerate the transition to more sustainable methods that depend less on primary inputs from agriculture, such as sugarcane, corn, soybeans, and palm, which are still the base for the majority of global biofuel production.

On the supply side, greater uptake of biofuels will depend on production capacity, distribution network, and regulatory mandates. While ethanol is approaching cost parity with fossil fuels in countries like Brazil, biomethane and biojet fuel for aviation can be twice as expensive. The availability of feedstock is a significant challenge as it often competes with food production. Expanding biofuels production using current technologies can also lead to land use conflicts, deforestation, and biodiversity loss, underlining the urgency of investing in new technologies to augment the output of second and third-generation biofuels that do not jeopardize food security.

Currently, 80 percent of the global production of biofuels is concentrated in the United States, Brazil, Europe, India, and Indonesia. Countries like India, Brazil, and the United States have adopted policies that support supply growth. The policies have sustained annual growth rates above 20 percent during a 5-year timeframe, resulting in Brazil having 21 percent of its transport energy provided by biofuels while the United States has 7 percent. In India, ethanol accounted for 6 percent of the energy used in gasoline vehicles in 2022, twice the levels recorded in 2019. However, these markets comprise only half of the worldwide transport fuel demand. For there to be a sustainable increase in biofuels, new markets will have to be developed, while current ones will have to expand their production. Consequently, compacts like the Global Biofuel Alliance (GBA), launched during India’s G20 presidency in 2023, can serve as knowledge platforms that foster collaboration and work on ensuring secure and cost-effective biofuel supply while shaping robust standard settings and certifications for nations and other stakeholders.

This paper argues that biofuels represent a viable alternative within the energy mix for a country’s comprehensive energy transition, especially in the Global South. It will explore the bioenergy market and its dynamics, examine countries' sustainable policies and mandates, and assess the GBA's role in fostering innovation to scale production and align the sector with Net Zero Emissions goals and targets.

II. The Role of Biofuels in the Energy Transition, Market Dynamics, and Investment

Sustainable biofuel production is still not on course with the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) by 2050 Scenario. In the NZE Scenario, sustainable biofuel production needs to triple by 2030 to successfully abate emissions from current and future vehicles, such as trucks, planes, ships, and passenger cars, that have few other mitigation measures. To narrow the gap between biofuel production and deployment with the NZE goals, there is a need to strengthen existing country-level policies to establish new biofuels blending targets, advance technology, and develop new markets.

As the world works to decrease its dependence on fossil fuels, road transport is the closest to meeting the NZE Scenario targets as a result of greater use of biofuels and an increased share of electric vehicles. High-income countries have progressively augmented the electrification of their transportation systems, in addition to EVs constituting 25 percent or more of new vehicle sales. In the Global South's low- and middle-income countries, biofuels derived from crops and a small set of waste and residues like the used cooking oil and tallow offer immediate, affordable alternatives for decarbonizing the transportation system. Biofuels derived from other wastes and residues, such as cellulosic ethanol and algae, are costly, thus slowing their adoption until now.

Most biofuels mandates have a minimum greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) intensity requirement, ensuring biofuels are at least 50 percent lower emitting than fossil fuels and as much as 80 percent for some fuels. Additional advantages include biofuels serving as “drop-in” alternatives for fossil fuels, as their use integrates well with a good portion of the existing petroleum and natural gas infrastructure (Figure 2). In South American countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Guatemala, replacing gasoline and diesel with ethanol and biodiesel could reduce GHG emissions by up to 84 percent. Studies indicate that significant reductions in GHG emissions for biofuels are possible in countries in Africa and Asia, up to 78 percent for biodiesel and 81 percent for ethanol compared to conventional fuels.

While there is substantial evidence that the available sustainable feedstocks could triple biofuel production by 2030, over 80 percent of that production occurs in only four countries: the United States, Brazil, Europe, and Indonesia. African nations, for instance, are nearly absent from the biofuels market, representing less than 1 percent of global production and consumption. Although current producers frequently expand their output, to align biofuel production with the NZE scenario, demand and supply must increase, necessitating the development of new markets and a boost in existing production.

The global biofuels market share surpassed $113 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $261 billion by 2034, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 6.9 percent from 2025 to 2034. The increased demand is driven by heightened concerns about energy security, economic development, sustainability goals, climate policies, and government incentives to decarbonize various sectors. A total of 58 countries have mandated ethanol blending with gasoline, while 48 countries have set biodiesel blending requirements.

Figure 3. Global Biofuels Production (2009-2023)

Certain emerging markets — Brazil, Indonesia, and India — are leading growth in biofuel production through mandates and incentives, primarily in road transport, which is expected to increase fuel demand by 27 billion liters. However, despite setting targets for the use of biofuels in aviation and maritime sectors, these countries have yet to implement concrete mandates and incentives to support these ambitions. In contrast, advanced economies like the United States and the European Union (EU) members are leading growth in air and maritime shipping, respectively, driven by strong mandates. By 2030, the aviation and shipping industries are projected to account for 75 percent of the new biofuel demand, mainly in the United States and the EU, spurred by policy incentives.

This growth is further reinforced by the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net-Zero Framework, which introduces a global fuel standard requiring ships to progressively reduce their greenhouse gas fuel intensity and establishes an economic mechanism where high-emitting vessels must purchase remedial units while low-emission ships may receive financial rewards. While advanced economies are currently driving the transition, there is untapped potential for emerging economies to expand into the maritime biofuels market by adopting similar regulatory and incentive structures.

While U.S. mandates under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) remain uncertain, the EU has set a target to reach 14.5 percent renewable energy in transportation by 2030, setting specific targets for biofuels and hydrogen, including a 2 percent aviation fuel blend by 2025. India’s 2022 update to its National Biofuels Policy has accelerated targets for blending ethanol and biodiesel. Brazil’s 2024 Fuel of the Future program aimed at boosting investment, including sustainable aviation fuel (Figure 4).

Private sector investments have also played an essential role in advancing the global biofuels industry. In 2023, the net amount of power generated by transport biofuels increased to a decade-high level, attributed to an 8 percent rise in investment. Although several traditional biofuel projects have been announced recently, such as Brazil’s Grupo Potential investing $109 million to increase its annual biodiesel production capacity from 900 million to 1.62 billion liters, most new investments in the biofuels sector are now directed toward expanding the production of so-called drop-in fuels. These include renewable diesel (HVO), biojet, and biomethane, which are chemically similar or identical to the fossil fuels they replace and can be used without engine or infrastructure modifications. In contrast, bioethanol, biodiesel, and biogas generally require blending or equipment adjustments and thus are not considered true drop-in fuels. For example, Raízen, Brazil’s largest sugar and ethanol producer, recently unveiled plans to invest R$11.5 ($2) billion in constructing nine second-generation ethanol (E2G), biogas, and biomethane plants across the country, of which only biomethane would be classified as a drop-in fuel.

III. International Collaboration on Biofuels and Lessons from the Global South

International cooperation, involving the joint action of nations, organizations, and stakeholders, is crucial to realizing biofuels' full potential. Emerging markets in Latin America and Asia are experiencing robust growth in their biofuels sectors. The increasing demand for sustainable energy, abundant local resources, and ample land for biofuel production fuels this growth and showcases the potential for further development.

The Global Biofuel Alliance and Its Priorities

Indian prime minister Narendra Modi launched the GBA at the G20 Summit in Delhi in 2023. The alliance, which includes governments, international organizations, and industries, brings together the world's biggest biofuel consumers and producers. Its 24 member countries include the United States and Brazil, the world’s largest and second-largest biofuel producers, respectively. It builds on existing global initiatives such as the Clean Energy Ministerial Biofuture Platform, the Global Bioenergy Partnership, and the Technology Cooperation Program that have advanced international biofuel cooperation over the past four decades.

The alliance's three key priorities are to identify and develop high-potential markets for the sustainable production of biofuels, to accelerate technology deployment to commercialize biofuels, and to establish performance-based sustainability frameworks. Global alliances like the GBA are essential in balancing biofuel adoption with climate goals. While biofuels offer a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels, their impact depends on the technologies and processes countries and industries use to produce them. Without careful implementation, production risks could undermine climate change mitigation efforts.

To succeed in these priorities — attracting public and private sector investment and advancing the commercialization of innovative conversion technologies — a complete life cycle assessment of biofuels is essential to determine whether these fuels reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The GBA can set the directions for the entire biofuel supply chain upstream (feedstock and land use), midstream (conversion pathways), and downstream (blending and deployment) to prevent any additional environmental degradation. Our review points to a trio of key lessons for the GBA to be an effective instrument to support the adoption of biofuels as a key objective of a just and equitable energy transition led by the Global South. As we explain below, those are implementing strong regulations, promoting technological innovation, and advancing cross-learning.

Lessons from the Global South

Strong Regulatory Frameworks, Standards, and Targets Governments utilize various tools, including blending mandates, excise taxes, subsidies, tax credits, and fiscal incentives, to narrow biofuel cost gaps, boost production, and shield consumers from price fluctuations. Financial incentives like tax credits, loan guarantees, and subsidies help mitigate the higher production costs of biofuels, attract investment, lower market barriers, and accelerate biofuel adoption. Renewable fuel standards and blending targets create steady biofuel demand by requiring fixed volumes or percentages in fuel mixtures. To tackle sustainability concerns, feedstock regulations prevent deforestation and biodiversity loss, while certification programs such as the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) establish sustainability standards.

Brazil is a global leader in biofuels, producing 23 percent of the world's supply in 2021, with a strong regulatory framework supporting its biofuel sector. The country’s biofuel policies, such as the RenovaBio, aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector by promoting the production and use of biofuels. RenovaBio includes a certification system that rewards producers for their carbon efficiency, enabling them to trade decarbonization credits (CBIOs) on the stock exchange. These initiatives are part of Brazil's commitment to meeting its climate targets under the Paris Agreement, reducing emissions, and boosting investment in biofuels through innovative market-based mechanisms.

India has also made significant strides in biofuel development with its National Biofuels Policy, which targets a 20 percent ethanol blend by 2025-2026 and a 5 percent biodiesel blend by 2030. The country’s Ethanol Blending Program (EBP) has improved ethanol supply and reduced fuel import reliance. India is working towards self-sufficiency in biofuels, supported by new standards introduced in 2023 by the Bureau of Indian Standards. These standards aim to boost production and industry practices as India moves toward its long-term energy goals, including achieving net zero by 2070.

Meanwhile, Indonesia has focused on enhancing its biodiesel sector, using its abundant palm oil resources. The country aims to increase its biodiesel blending rate to 50 percent by 2028 and has introduced the Indonesia Sustainable Palm Oil Standard (ISPO) to ensure sustainability in palm oil production. This framework aligns with domestic and international regulations to strengthen the palm oil sector’s competitiveness while contributing to emission reduction targets.

Promoting Technological Innovation To commercialize the advanced biofuels necessary to align with the NZE scenario, the rate of technology deployment must increase fifteen-fold by 2030 compared to 2021 standards. To achieve this, efforts in technology development and innovation are crucial for enhancing land productivity, optimizing the use of existing marginal land, and improving the collection of waste and residues from feedstocks compatible with current biofuel technologies. Brazil, India, and Indonesia are leading the way in biofuel innovation, integrating research with industry to bolster energy security, sustainability, and economic growth.

Brazil's biofuel growth has been backed by research led by Embrapa, a state-owned research corporation connected to the Ministry of Agriculture of Brazil. Embrapa focuses on increasing feedstock productivity without deforestation. Fermentation, bagasse recycling, and land restoration innovations optimize agricultural waste use. With over 40 million hectares of degraded pastureland, Brazil has significant potential to expand its biofuel production. Embrapa collaborates with companies such as Petrobras to develop low-carbon products, including biofuels, green chemicals, and fertilizers. Other partnerships, such as with Acelen, which operates the Mataripe refinery, involve cultivating the macaw palm for large-scale renewable fuel production. The project seeks to establish clear environmental and social guidelines, create 90,000 direct and indirect jobs, and generate over $1.3 billion in annual income for the involved communities.

India has also led biofuel production technology by investing $17 million in 75 joint biofuel projects, emphasizing sustainable biofuels, carbon capture, and smart grids. Funding for clean energy has surged, resulting in 5,000 compressed biogas (CBG) plants and pilot projects for hydrogen-methane fuel. The government also backs enzyme research for 2G ethanol and bioenergy research centers.

Indonesia has advanced biodiesel research since the 1990s, with institutions like LEMIGAS and BPPT developing biodiesel production from palm oil, used cooking oil, and jatropha. Research on pilot-scale production and engine trials led to small- and medium-scale biodiesel plants for testing and quality refinement. Once standards were met, regulations enabled commercial production. The biodiesel sector expanded with government and investor support, leading to the formation of APROBI (Indonesia Biofuel Producer Association) in 2006 to strengthen industry collaboration and policy development on biofuel usage in Indonesia.

Advancement of Cross-Learning One significant barrier to expanding biofuel use is the absence of internationally recognized sustainability standards. This mainly concerns the debate over land use for biomass cultivation and food security, which suggests that land necessary for food production may be diverted to biofuel production. Brazil, India, and Indonesia are engaged in international biofuel initiatives to establish standards for sustainable practices and promote adoption while considering local conditions in emerging producing countries. Brazil participates in the Biofuture Platform Initiative, the IEA Bioenergy Technology Collaboration Program, and bilateral agreements like its memorandum of understanding on Bioenergy Cooperation with India. Indonesia, a member of several biofuels initiatives, recently accepted India’s Global Biofuels Alliance invitation, emphasizing biofuels' growing role in international cooperation.

Leading bioenergy producers demonstrate that biofuel demand can be satisfied. However, solutions must be customized to each country’s conditions, considering resource availability, regulations, and technology. Since no nation can independently serve the biofuel market, international collaboration through platforms like the GBA is essential for promoting global biofuel sustainability. Countries like Brazil, India, and Indonesia have established strong institutional frameworks and policies that can serve as models for countries in the GBA and others.

IV. Conclusion

Biofuels emit significantly lower levels of greenhouse gases than conventional fossil fuels, making them a key solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and an essential step in the energy transition process. They also enhance energy security by reducing the reliance on imported fossil fuels and increasing domestic production, which can increase countries’ energy system diversification and stability. Additionally, biofuel can strengthen rural economies by creating jobs and new revenue streams for farmers while establishing sustainable credentials and standards that ensure ecologically and socially appropriate production methods.

Although advancements have been made in the biofuels sector, fully realizing their potential and aligning production with the Net Zero Emissions Scenario will require ongoing efforts across industries and stakeholders. Drawing from emerging market models, which have been leading biofuel growth, the Global Biofuels Alliance can play a crucial role in addressing the institutional challenges that new biofuel-producing countries face, enabling collaboration, fostering policy development, and promoting sustainable frameworks.

By fostering global dialogue, supporting national bioenergy legislation, and collaborating with existing international initiatives, the Global Biofuels Alliance can help streamline the integration of biofuels into the worldwide energy mix. The alliance can also facilitate access to global financial resources, ensuring that countries and industries have the support needed to enter and compete in the biofuels market. Through coordinated efforts, the alliance can strengthen biofuel trade, drive investments in innovative technologies, and promote responsible policies and sustainable frameworks. By expanding market opportunities and ensuring sustainable resource use, the Global Biofuels Alliance can accelerate the transition to a resilient energy future, aligning with global sustainability goals and emission reduction targets.

In a joint letter with Cllr Anne Handley, leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, addressed to secretary of state for business and trade, Jonathan Reynolds MP, as well as Heidi Alexander MP, secretary of state for transport, Cllr Ross stressed the need for strong central government support for Vivergo Fuels ahead of next week’s launch of the national Industrial Strategy.

He stated that the future of the Vivergo plant, based at Saltend Chemicals Park, is at imminent risk as a result of the recent UK-US trade deal and poor regulation.

Cllr Ross outlined the wider impact closure of Vivergo Fuels could have on the region and how it also raises questions about the government’s commitment to green energy and its policies to support it.

In the letter, Cllr Ross said: “Not only is Vivergo Fuels the UK’s largest bioethanol producer, with a crucial role to play in UK transport decarbonisation, but it’s also a strategically important anchor employer in the region.

“It supports over 160 skilled jobs directly and around 4,000 more in the supply chain, the majority of which are based in our Hull and East Riding region.

“The Humber has gained a deserved reputation as a beacon for renewable energy development and production and we are working extremely hard to attract further investment to the region in emerging technologies. such as hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel.

“This would be immeasurably harder to do if regulatory and financial support are not forthcoming for this business, which has already seen over £700m of private sector investment since 2012.

“The Government’s new UK-USA trade deal has deliberately moved the commercial goalposts, damaging a UK business, which invests in the UK and employs UK workers, whilst advantaging American businesses who produce their product overseas.

“Allowing closure of the Vivergo Fuels plant would send a hugely damaging signal to clean energy investors and to any businesses who are considering investing in this region and across the UK.

“The government has identified clean energy as one of its priority industries and states that its number one focus is encouraging growth, so we now need to see that rhetoric matched with concrete actions and support.

“On behalf of Hull City Council and East Riding of Yorkshire Council, I urge you to act swiftly to secure the necessary support for this business which is of great significance to the residents of our authority and many across our wider region.”

Ben Hackett, managing director of Vivergo Fuels, added: “Vivergo Fuels is a fantastic asset to Hull and East Yorkshire. Not only do we employ a highly skilled workforce and support thousands more jobs in the supply chain, we are a catalyst for further green industrial development and investment which would allow the fuels of the future to be pioneered right here on the Humber.

Palantir is cutting emissions by 31% from its 2019 baseline. It offsets the rest with high-quality carbon credits.

This achievement shows how software companies can lead in ESG even without making physical products. Its “product-first” strategy helps customers create climate solutions. At the same time, it keeps its own footprint low. This is ideal for investors who care about AI and sustainability. Let’s uncover how Palantir achieves its net-zero goal.

Cutting Code and Carbon: How Palantir Hits Net Zero

Palantir reached a major sustainability milestone in 2024 by achieving carbon neutrality across its global operations. This was made possible by reducing its total greenhouse gas emissions by 31% compared to its 2019 baseline.

In 2024, Palantir reported emissions of 23,018 metric tons of CO₂ equivalent (tCO₂e), a slight increase of 1.7% from 2023, when emissions were at 22,635 tCO₂e.

The company attributes the 2024 increase to a gradual return to business travel and operational activity. The trend shows clear progress. Emissions per employee have fallen by 57% since 2019. Now, each employee is responsible for only 6 tCO₂e.

Palantir’s carbon footprint is small compared to companies with physical supply chains or manufacturing. As a software company, it neither owns nor operates production facilities and primarily leases office spaces.

The software giant’s direct (Scope 1 and 2) emissions remain low and are mostly tied to heating and electricity use in its offices. The company partners with utility providers and landlords. This helps them gather better data on energy use, which improves reporting accuracy.

Most of Palantir’s emissions are Scope 3. This includes business travel, employee commuting, cloud computing, and third-party services. Business travel, in particular, has been the largest contributor.

To lessen this impact, Palantir urges employees to hold virtual meetings. They can join programs like United Airlines’ Eco-Skies Alliance. This program helps create sustainable aviation fuel.

Palantir has made notable progress in reducing emissions from its digital infrastructure. Between 2022 and 2023, the company’s cloud computing emissions fell by 32%. This decline was largely due to more energy-efficient data centers and software optimization.

The company is looking for partnerships with cloud providers. They focus on renewable energy and high energy-efficiency ratings.

RELATED: Palantir Reports Record-Breaking Q4 and Net Zero Success

To balance its residual emissions, Palantir purchases and retires verified carbon credits that support projects such as:

Landfill gas capture

Destruction of ozone-depleting substances

Renewable energy development

These projects were chosen for their environmental credibility. They also match the company’s commitment to long-term sustainability.

In 2023, Palantir formalized its environmental efforts by publishing its first Environmental Policy. The same year, its UK operations released a Carbon Reduction Plan, committing to a 42% cut in emissions by 2029. These steps show a bigger plan to include climate goals in how we operate and share information with the public.

Building Green Tools: Palantir’s Climate-Focused AI Platforms

Palantir not only manages its own environmental impact but also helps other organizations reach their climate and net zero goals. It uses its strong AI and data platforms to do this. The company describes itself as having a “product-first” philosophy—one that gives customers the tools to build climate solutions at scale.

Palantir offers platforms like Foundry, Gotham, and the Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). These support many climate-related use cases. These include:

Building digital twins of infrastructure to simulate environmental risks

Enhancing grid resilience through predictive modeling

Planning electric vehicle infrastructure deployment

Tracking carbon emissions across supply chains and operations

One of Palantir’s flagship ESG tools is the Agora platform, launched in 2022. Agora enables energy and commodity firms to monitor supply chain emissions in real time.

At the 2023 Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC), Palantir showed how Agora helps big partners like bp, Ecopetrol, and Trafigura. They use it to track, analyze, and cut carbon emissions from oil and gas operations.

In July 2024, Palantir teamed up with Tree Energy Solutions (TES). This partnership aims to boost green hydrogen production. TES uses Palantir’s software to model its supply chain, which includes hydrogen production sites and transport logistics. This helps track emissions, optimize energy use, and scale low-carbon fuel projects more quickly.

Palantir also works on internal sustainability initiatives. For example, in its London office, the company partners with Fooditude to reduce plastic and food waste. This partnership has cut single-use water bottles by 80%. It also promotes eco-friendly packaging and food sourcing.

Palantir is growing its AI and data operations. The company is also working hard to make its software and infrastructure more energy efficient. This means creating lighter apps, reducing server strain by optimizing workloads, and choosing cloud providers that use renewable energy.

Palantir’s approach highlights how software companies can impact climate change. They do this not only by reducing their own emissions but also by offering digital tools. These tools help speed up decarbonization in various industries.

Low Footprint, High Ambition

Palantir’s low footprint reflects its business model. It leases offices rather than owning buildings and doesn’t operate factories or own data centers. Even its cloud usage—from AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud—is relatively clean, with a 32% year‑over‑year drop in cloud‑related emissions from 2022 to 2023.

The company uses market-based accounting for Scope 2 and regularly audits its energy sources to improve accuracy. It invests in compute‑efficiency improvements for its AI platforms as well.

Palantir continues to reduce emissions in every area and offset what remains through verified credits and sustainable aviation fuel. It also submitted its emissions targets to the Science‑Based Targets Initiative in 2023 to gain external validation.

Why ESG‑Minded Investors Are Paying Attention

For investors focused on AI and ESG—especially those preferring companies with strong sustainability records—Palantir offers a compelling case with these reasons:

It proves corporate carbon neutrality is doable even for tech firms with global operations.

It features transparent emissions reporting, including per‑employee metrics and absolute reductions.

It enables other companies to reduce their own carbon footprints through Palantir-powered analytics.

Palantir shows that software companies can aim for net zero without sacrificing innovation. After reducing emissions by up to 38% since 2019 and offsetting the rest, it remains carbon neutral through 2024. Meanwhile, its AI platforms serve as foundations for climate solutions—from decarbonizing industry to planning clean energy.

For ESG-conscious investors and industry professionals, Palantir offers proof that advanced AI can support a sustainable future—not just improve the bottom line. Its path shows how tech giants can help the planet while building value, one code line at a time.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/shutterstock_2566125289.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 18:03:46.763833

The goal is to reach 3 per cent to 5 per cent SAF use by 2030.
“We are aware of concerns raised by various stakeholders, including the EU and the US, regarding fraudulent practices in the SAF supply chain.
Mr Robert Boyd, Boeing’s Asia-Pacific sustainability lead who previously worked for Iata, believes airlines’ exacting standards will bring positive change in the SAF industry.","– This is the starting point for the world’s – and especially Europe’s – lofty dreams of greener air travel: a collection point for plastic bottles filled with discarded frying oil in Malaysia.

One Saturday morning in May 2025 in the city of Melaka, volunteers in green T-shirts rushed over as Ms Adibah Rahim and her husband drove into the central square, eager to unpack, weigh and register her consignment of used cooking oil (UCO) – the “liquid gold” in European and Asian plans to ramp up production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Ms Rahim, a housewife, told The Straits Times it was her first time selling used oil, which she had collected over five to six months. She left the collection point RM90 (S$27) richer: At RM3 per litre of oil, it is a welcome boost to her family’s household budget.

“We usually collect UCO from around 200 members of the public,” said Mr Michael Andrew, sales manager for Evergreen Oil & Feed, the company running the Melaka collection with the local council. Evergreen, which runs similar collection drives elsewhere in Malaysia, supplies leading European SAF producers such as Spain’s Repsol, UK-based Shell and Finland’s Neste, the operator of SAF refineries in Europe and Singapore.

The aviation industry and many governments, including Singapore’s, are pinning their hopes on SAF as a way to cut the sector’s greenhouse gas emissions, which are set to increase as demand for flying grows.

And fuel suppliers around the world are scrambling for raw materials to meet new legal SAF blending quotas in Europe and growing demand elsewhere.

When it is made from waste such as UCO, rather than agricultural commodities such as soya or palm oil, SAF purportedly has up to 80 per cent less planet-heating emissions than kerosene jet fuel. And repurposing waste cooking oil avoids using land that would otherwise be used for food crops, or fuelling forest destruction.

But behind SAF’s climate-friendly facade, a months-long investigation by Climate Home News and The Straits Times has uncovered an opaque global supply chain that exposes jet fuel providers and their aviation clients to significant fraud risks – raising doubts about the climate benefits of the sector’s main green hope for the years ahead.

The concern is that barely used and virgin palm oil – the latter is not permitted under European Union rules because of its links to rainforest loss – is being passed off as UCO that traders supply to fuel companies, experts and industry operators said.

The investigation focused on the UCO trade between Malaysia, the world’s second-biggest palm oil producer, and Spain, the EU’s largest aviation market and home to one of its SAF pioneers – oil and gas giant Repsol.

The investigation was funded by Journalismfund Europe.

Fried in Spain?

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, Repsol chief executive Josu Jon Imaz held up his company’s new €250 million (S$369 million) plant for renewable fuels, including SAF, near the historic Spanish port town of Cartagena as an example of how Europe can pursue a fair green transition.

Repsol, which aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, started large-scale production of biodiesel and jet fuel – with its SAF mainly made from UCO – at the plant early in 2024.

Contrasting this with electric vehicles, many of them imported from China, Dr Imaz said the raw material for Repsol’s renewable fuels “comes from the Spanish farms and from the Spanish rural economy”.

In a promotional video for those fuels, Spanish celebrity chef Susi Diaz is seen dispensing advice to young cooks in the kitchen of her La Finca restaurant. Olive oil is then poured out of a pan into steel jugs as a voiceover explains how the waste cooking residue will be sent to the Repsol biofuel refinery.

The company is also promoting the recycling of UCO from Spanish households – of which it says only 5 per cent is currently collected – at its fuel stations across the country.

Spain’s restaurants and homes, however, are not the main source of Repsol’s UCO.

In 2024, more than 126,000 tonnes of UCO from Asia – enough to fill 50 Olympic-size swimming pools – arrived in the Spanish region of Murcia, where Repsol’s flagship biofuel plant is located, according to trade data published by Spain’s tax agency.

Nearly two-thirds came from Malaysia, whose UCO exports to the region saw a tenfold rise in the same year that the energy heavyweight fired up its Cartagena SAF refinery.

The figures do not specify who provided or bought the raw material. But trade data shows that Repsol purchased at least 53,000 tonnes of UCO from five Malaysian companies, including Evergreen Oil & Feed, in 2024. That amount represents 18 per cent of the UCO the Repsol plant in Cartagena uses annually.

This is based on an analysis of Customs records provided by investigative consultancy Data Desk, which provided Climate Home News with a list of shipments of UCO certified for the European market, sourced from Malaysia by Repsol’s trading unit in Singapore.

No incidents of fraudulent UCO were detected in Repsol’s supply chain, with imports meeting EU rules on green certification.

Repsol told Climate Home News it “complements with imports when necessary” and receives raw material shipments from more than 20 countries. It declined to provide more details about the imports for “competitive reasons”.

Repsol’s heavy reliance on Malaysian supplies exposes it to fraud risks that raise wider questions about global assertions over the sustainability of SAF.

Asked what steps it takes to fight fraud, Repsol said it operates a rigorous supplier monitoring system to ensure the sustainability and integrity of its SAF production. A “very strong” compliance process means dubious raw materials and suppliers suspected of misconduct are quickly weeded out, it added.

“Any type of fraud distorts the market and undermines the confidence in the system, so it must be fought with all possible legal means,” the company said in e-mailed comments.

Shrinking air travel’s carbon footprint

Europe’s green aviation fuel refineries are boosting output because of new requirements by the EU for planes to use more SAF in the coming decades. From the start of 2025, fuel supplied to airports across Europe needs to contain at least 2 per cent of SAF, with targets rising to 70 per cent by 2050.

A million tonnes of SAF is needed to hit the EU’s 2025 mandate, and this will rise to 2.7 million tonnes a year by 2030 to meet the 6 per cent mandate.

SAF is crucial for shrinking aviation’s carbon footprint, according to industry body the International Air Transport Association (Iata), and is expected to account for 65 per cent of emissions reductions by 2050, when the sector has committed to reaching net zero.

In 2023, emissions from international plane travel accounted for 2.5 per cent of the world’s energy-related carbon emissions. As air travel increases, and other sectors are more easily able to decarbonise, that share is set to grow.

One of the reasons SAF is so attractive is that it is a drop-in fuel for planes, requiring no new additional infrastructure at airports. Current technology allows up to 50 per cent of SAF to be blended with fossil fuel-based jet fuel.

Repsol’s Dr Imaz told financial analysts early in 2024 that emissions-cutting alternatives to SAF – such as restricting short-haul flights – would represent “a drop in the ocean”.

Repsol’s plant uses 300,000 tonnes of UCO to produce 250,000 tonnes of renewable fuels, including SAF and hydrotreated vegetable oil.

But surging demand for UCO, SAF’s feedstock of choice, and a far-from-perfect global certification system based on self-declaration at the start of the supply chain are encouraging fraud that undermines the new fuel’s green credentials.

‘Ridiculous’ export statistics

This investigation found that by the time Asia-based traders ship UCO supplies overseas to refineries for processing into SAF, guaranteeing their environmental integrity is virtually impossible – despite the certification system on which fuel companies and airlines rely.

A source at a leading Malaysian UCO supplier to companies including Repsol told ST that he suspects that both UCO collectors and restaurants are committing fraud by providing oil that does not qualify as used, although it is difficult to prove.

In Malaysia, which is among the world’s leading suppliers of UCO and virgin palm oil, government-subsidised cooking oil is cheaper than UCO – providing a clear incentive for fraud. Subsidised cooking oil sells for RM2.50 per kg versus the UCO trading price of up to RM4.50 per kg.

In a 2024 report, Brussels-based environmental group Transport & Environment (T&E) cited figures showing that Malaysia already exports about three times as much UCO as it is estimated to collect domestically and import, raising concern about where that oil is coming from – and what it consists of.

In 2023, 458,000 tonnes of UCO originating in Malaysia were registered with International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), the leading certification scheme recognised by the European Commission to demonstrate compliance with its biofuel sustainability criteria.

In absolute terms, that puts Malaysia second only to China, which registered 1.65 million tonnes. Malaysia’s UCO volume, if indeed collected from its population, works out to 15.2 litres per person – the highest worldwide by far.

This figure is “ridiculous”, said Mr Cian Delaney, campaign coordinator at T&E, adding that for it to be feasible, Malaysia would need to be “a world-leading collection and refining system – which it isn’t”.

In comparison, China collected 1.4 litres per capita, while the figure is 0.9 litre in Indonesia and 3.8 litres in Spain.

Malaysia’s Deputy Minister of Plantation and Commodities Chan Foong Hin has previously acknowledged there is fraud in the country’s UCO supply chain. He told Reuters in February 2025 that the government would crack down on this to uphold the country’s “reputation as a responsible exporter”.

In a response to questions from ST, he said: “To maintain supply chain integrity, various measures are in place, including traceability systems, certification requirements, and stringent export documentation. The Malaysian Palm Oil Board , in collaboration with other regulatory bodies, is actively monitoring the industry to prevent fraudulent activities.”

He also said the government was strengthening enforcement mechanisms to uphold industry credibility.

Opaque supply chain

The waste ingredients from which SAF is made change hands multiple times in a largely opaque system. To verify their sustainability, European regulators rely on checks by private auditors and agencies that issue green certificates based on their findings.

But there is a systemic blind spot: The restaurants, street stalls, households and factories from which the UCO is pooled self-declare the origin of their contributions. Aside from ad hoc spot checks and sampling, there is no way of knowing that all of these providers are telling the truth.

“The opportunity ... of fraud is very high,” said Mr Vasu R. Vasuthewan, former Malaysia head for the ISCC.

The Malaysian authorities recently uncovered criminal syndicates that had pocketed thousands of dollars a day by getting hold of large amounts of subsidised cooking oil, mixing it in with UCO, and then selling it on to industrial UCO traders.

Sources within the industry told Climate Home News and ST that many households and restaurants are motivated to replace cooking oil after a single use – contrary to the standard practice of three to five times – and then sell it on as UCO. Cooking oil is considered waste when it is no longer fit for frying.

“Restaurant compliance (with sustainability standards) may be very low,” said Mr Vasuthewan, who now runs his own UCO import and export business. “Many will fake their declaration, hoping they won’t get caught.”

Mr Delaney of T&E said it is difficult for auditors to physically check the origin of the oil, since hundreds of restaurants can supply the same collection point, making it a “notable blind spot”.

Singapore, a global SAF hub in the making

Singapore is a key part of the global SAF supply chain and is positioning itself as a leader in the production and usage of such fuel. The Republic is home to the world’s largest SAF refinery by capacity: Neste’s biofuel refinery in Tuas. Its SAF production capacity is one million tonnes a year.

Government trade data shows that Singapore is a major importer of UCO from China and Malaysia; this is most likely for the Neste refinery. The Republic also has a licensing framework for local UCO collectors, who pick up UCO mainly from restaurants, hotels and commercial kitchens, with about 19,000 tonnes collected annually from 2021 to 2024, according to the National Environment Agency.

The Government regards SAF as a critical tool to reduce aviation emissions while allowing the industry to keep expanding and Changi Airport, one of the world’s busiest, to keep growing.

To ramp up SAF usage, from 2026, all flights departing Singapore’s two civilian airports must use 1 per cent SAF. The goal is to reach 3 per cent to 5 per cent SAF use by 2030.

Fraud is a concern for the authorities and the industry.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) told ST that it recognises the importance of ensuring transparency and integrity in SAF feedstocks.

“We are aware of concerns raised by various stakeholders, including the EU and the US, regarding fraudulent practices in the SAF supply chain. We share the same concerns as these pose risks to market confidence, fair trading and development of a nascent SAF market,” said CAAS chief sustainability officer Daniel Ng.

He said the authority is working with the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection to develop “harmonised standards for feedstock verification to prevent further fraudulent practices”.

Neste told ST, in response to questions: “Neste sources traceable UCO and other renewable raw materials globally from carefully selected suppliers. Neste evaluates its suppliers and accepts renewable raw materials only from those suppliers that are able to meet strict criteria for sustainability.”

The Singapore Airlines Group said it works closely with its partners to ensure supplies meet internationally recognised standards such as the ISCC, and comply with regulatory requirements in jurisdictions with SAF mandates.

Spot checks, patchy audits

There is a system in place to keep fraudulent stocks out of the supply chain. Buyers and regulators in Europe rely on audit companies to trace the raw materials used in SAF and prove their green credentials.

Those audits are verified by authorised certification systems like the ISCC – which is led by the biofuel industry and, according to one source, enjoys “a kind of monopoly” in the sector. It then issues sustainability certificates to commodities traders and fuel suppliers.

According to the ISCC, its certification supports “sustainable, fully traceable, deforestation-free and climate-friendly supply chains”.

While in some cases auditors conduct random field checks, that happens less often in countries outside the EU, industry experts say.

According to Mr James Cogan, compliance and markets lead at Irish biofuel firm ClonBio, it is far easier for fraud to occur outside the EU where “it’s much less visible to us”.

A 2024 analysis by T&E in China, for example, showed that sampling of points of origin happened in less than 10 per cent of the ISCC-approved audits, whereas in the EU, it was about 30 per cent.

Mr Adam Kirby, ISCC’s senior sustainability manager, told Climate Home News that auditors monitor volumes going in and out of collection points for any suspicious behaviour, in addition to carrying out spot checks. He added that the ISCC follows the requirements established by regulators like the European Commission.

In 2024, the ISCC also conducted 79 special “integrity assessments” – around two-thirds targeting Asia-based suppliers – which independently monitored the work of auditors. In a third of the cases, it found violations of its certification requirements, including an inability to demonstrate the traceability of products, leading to the withdrawal of 11 certificates.

Long paper trail

Under the current system, the entire SAF supply chain relies on a long paper trail rooted in those self-declarations and sporadic inspections at the points where UCO is collected.

In Malaysia, Evergreen’s owner C.K. Lau told ST that the company follows the proper processes in its collection based on the requirements established by the ISCC. He added that the documentation is critical as, otherwise, the company would not be able to export its UCO.

Repsol, for its part, said it requires “suppliers to be certified under European Commission-recognised voluntary regimes”.

In turn, airline companies that buy from Repsol, such as the International Airlines Group (IAG) – the parent company of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling, Aer Lingus and Level – rely on documentation they get from it and other jet fuel providers, to show that the SAF they are paying for has green certification.

In exceptional cases, IAG has sent its own staff to carry out checks on the ground, as with a Shanghai-based Chinese supplier in 2024. It told Climate Home News the outcome of that audit – which included supply, record-keeping, environmental and health and safety standards – was “positive”.

Mr Robert Boyd, Boeing’s Asia-Pacific sustainability lead who previously worked for Iata, believes airlines’ exacting standards will bring positive change in the SAF industry. “You’ll see a race to the top... on sustainability, and it will, in a way, be self-regulated,” he added.

SAF certification faces EU scrutiny

In the meantime, following a string of fraud allegations about the authenticity of UCO-derived biofuels imported from China, the EU has been trying to ascertain whether the certification system that governments and businesses rely on is fit for purpose.

The EU authorities have been in talks to strengthen that system, leading to speculation that the ISCC could be suspended for failing to catch cases of biodiesel fraud. The ISCC denied in a statement that regulators had considered halting automatic EU-wide acceptance of its certificates, adding that its relationship with the European Commission remained constructive.

“There are always bad actors, there are always bad people, and there’s only a certain amount of policing that can be done in any industry,” said Mr Kirby. “We at ISCC have done, I think, an incredible job.”

The ISCC did not respond to follow-up questions from Climate Home News on whether it has full confidence in the current system, including self-declaration.

A European Commission spokeswoman said the bloc’s executive arm was closely monitoring the SAF market “to detect and prevent fraud, which risks undermining the EU’s ambition to effectively decarbonise air transport”.

Demand for UCO sizzles

Demand for SAF and UCO is only expected to increase as usage in Europe, Asia and elsewhere grows and as new refineries are completed in China, South Korea and Malaysia.

In 2024, Malaysia’s state energy firm Petronas, Italy’s Enilive, and Euglena of Japan announced they would develop a biorefinery at Petronas’ Pengerang Integrated Complex in Johor. Due for completion in 2028, it would produce SAF and other biofuels.

Malaysia plans to mandate SAF usage by 2027, with the initial goal of blending it into aviation fuel at a 1 per cent rate.

Leading European refiners like Repsol are pushing for a level global playing field as well as more public funding to bring down costs and help develop the nascent sector on the continent.

Iata warned earlier in June that the European mandates had caused the SAF price paid by airlines to double because of hefty compliance fees being charged by producers.

Repsol’s aviation head Carlos Suarez Cubillo warned that fuel producers in parts of the world with laxer rules could produce SAF “with less regulation and less control of the feedstock... and here in Europe that could de-incentivise the production, the construction of new facilities”.

In Brazil, for example, an emerging SAF industry is gearing up to use crop-based feedstocks that are commonly linked to deforestation – and are therefore banned in Europe – such as soya and palm oil, as well as sugarcane-based ethanol, which has been linked to labour abuses and modern slavery.

An investigation by Climate Home News’ partner in Brazil, InfoAmazonia, found that the palm oil producer behind a planned biorefinery in the Amazon region – billed as Brazil’s first SAF project – is growing the crop on land areas subject to sanctions by the national environment agency over illegal deforestation, and is struggling financially after rights abuse allegations.

Iata hopes its efforts to put in place a global registry for SAF, launched in April as a voluntary initiative, will boost transparency around feedstocks and their greenhouse gas savings – and enable airlines to have some level of visibility and comparability between countries, fuel providers and airports.

SAF producers and airlines are also looking to other waste-based materials to meet rising mandates – especially as more advanced fuels made from hydrogen and carbon dioxide, known as e-SAF, are still being developed and tested.

Repsol, for example, recently closed a deal with US vegetable oils giant Bunge to source camelina and safflower – non-food crops that can grow on poor land – to produce hydrotreated vegetable oil for biodiesel and SAF.

In January, it also announced it would invest more than €800 million in Europe’s first plant in the Catalan city of Tarragona to produce renewable methanol from organic urban waste, for use in maritime, road and aviation transport from 2029.

But in the meantime, Europe’s overwhelming reliance on UCO means it will continue to import supplies from Asia – despite the concerns over fraud, said Ms Sophie Byron, global head of biofuels pricing at S&P Global Commodity Insights.

“That trade flow is not going away any time soon,” she said.

Here are some key things to know about SAF: How is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made?
Currently, SAF is between two and seven times more expensive than traditional jet fuel, depending on how it is produced.
The price of fossil fuel-based jet fuel is also kept artificially low because of wide-ranging tax exemptions.","The world’s insatiable appetite for flying is fuelling concerns about how to shrink the carbon footprint of air travel, today the source of about 2.5 per cent of humanity’s planet-warming emissions related to energy.

While that is a relatively small share of total global emissions, it looks set to increase in the decades to come, as significantly cutting emissions is still a distant technological prospect for commercial aircraft, even as other sectors, such as road transport, are doing so by going electric.

For airlines and governments across the world, the solution is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which backers say can cut emissions by more than 80 per cent, without requiring aircraft modifications.

SAF is designed to be a drop-in fuel for planes, needing no new additional infrastructure at airports. Current technology allows up to 50 per cent of SAF to be blended with fossil fuel-based jet fuel.

Here are some key things to know about SAF:

How is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made?

The fuel can be made from a variety of raw materials, or feedstocks, using different techniques, but today virtually all of it is made from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (Hefa). The Hefa production process involves stripping oxygen from the fat molecules of natural oils and fats and replacing it with hydrogen. Hefa fuel has various uses, including in aviation.

Used cooking oil (UCO) is currently the most common feedstock for SAF, especially in Europe where policies promote its use as a recycled waste product that does not compete for land with food production or carry a high risk of deforestation, in contrast to virgin oils derived from soya beans or palm.

Other regions are prioritising feedstocks that can be easily sourced locally, such as soya in the US and palm oil in Brazil. The two agricultural powerhouses are also expected to produce large quantities of SAF by converting ethanol made from corn or sugarcane – another kind of drop-in fuel known as alcohol-to-jet.

SAF can also be made without crops or organic waste. Synthetic fuels – known as e-SAF or power-to-liquid SAF – are made using hydrogen, generated from renewable electricity, and carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere or industrial processes.

How much SAF are airlines using?

A tiny amount. SAF accounted for just 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production in 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association, which has called the take-up rate “disappointing”.

Cost is the main reason for the slow roll-out. Currently, SAF is between two and seven times more expensive than traditional jet fuel, depending on how it is produced. That is primarily down to the limited availability of feedstocks like UCO, which is hard to collect from restaurants and households. The price of fossil fuel-based jet fuel is also kept artificially low because of wide-ranging tax exemptions.

Around the world, a number of governments are trying to expand the market for cleaner aviation fuels by offering financial incentives and making the use of SAF in planes compulsory.

The European Union and the UK introduced the world’s first SAF mandates in January 2025, requiring fuel suppliers to blend at least 2 per cent SAF with conventional kerosene. The blending requirement will gradually increase to reach 32 per cent in the EU and 22 per cent in the UK by 2040.

SAF mandates are also coming into force over the next few years in Singapore and Brazil, and other major aviation hubs such as Japan and China plan to introduce targets for its use.

Singapore has been very active in trying to grow regional demand for such fuel. In May , the World Economic Forum and Singapore’s GenZero, a Temasek-owned investment platform, launched the Green Fuel Forward initiative to scale up production of SAF. The initiative draws in airlines, refiners, logistics companies, banks and others to invest in greater SAF usage.

Will SAF lead to net-zero air travel?

That remains to be seen. Existing and planned SAF projects in advanced stages will meet between 2 per cent and 4 per cent of jet fuel demand by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency, far short of what is needed to put the sector on track to meet its goal of reaching net zero by 2050.

Airlines have been sounding the alarm about scant supplies and demanding policies to incentivise production to lower costs. In March, the chief executive officers of Ryanair, the International Airline Group (IAG), Lufthansa and Air France-KLM warned that the EU’s 6 per cent SAF requirement for 2030 would be impossible to meet because of the high cost and scarcity of the greener fuel.

Asked to comment, the EU said the current SAF targets are “realistic and feasible”.

Who guarantees that SAF is a climate-friendly solution?

Governments and the International Civil Aviation Organisation require specific certification to prove the sustainability of a batch of SAF and the raw materials needed for its production.

The world’s leading certification scheme is the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), an industry-led initiative that aims to support “sustainable, fully traceable, deforestation-free and climate-friendly supply chains”. EU regulators use ISCC certificates as proof of origin and sustainability of SAF produced and used in the bloc.

Approved third-party auditors are in charge of inspecting SAF plants and their suppliers along the global supply chain, which are then approved by the ISCC following EU standards.

Throughout the different stages of the SAF supply chain, the ISCC requires operators to pass certified information on the origin of raw materials and their carbon savings from one operator to another. But for some feedstocks, tracing their origin can be tricky.

In the case of UCO – the main raw material used in the EU today – suppliers at the point of origin, such as restaurants and individuals, are required to fill out a self-declaration form. The system relies on their honest claim that their product is actually waste oil. So there is some room for fraud, and efforts from airlines and regulators to close any loopholes are key.

Are air ticket prices higher because of SAF?

Some airlines have started passing on the extra costs of SAF to passengers, but for now this remains a small amount. However, IAG warned in 2024 that airfares would need to rise to fund the shift to cleaner fuels.

Air France-KLM and Lufthansa have added mandatory SAF levies to tickets, with the German flag carrier charging up to €72 (S$110) per flight depending on the route and fare, to cover the cost of complying with Europe’s new SAF mandates.

While stopping short of applying a surcharge, British Airways encourages members of its loyalty programme to make voluntary contributions for SAF, enabling them to pay with and earn points.

In Singapore, travellers flying out of the country will pay an SAF levy from 2026, when all departing flights will be required to carry fuel with 1 per cent SAF. Preliminary estimates from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore suggest that economy-class passengers may incur an additional $3 levy for short-haul flights, $6 for medium-haul and $16 for long-haul flights.

A growing number of airlines also offer customers the option to pay a voluntary SAF charge as a way to help offset the carbon footprint of their journey.

Wood said its scope of work on the LBCC project will include redesigning existing processing infrastructure within the refinery to enable production of gasoline with notably reduced sulfur content complying with Colombia’s national targets for cleaner fuels, as well as ambitions to improve national air quality and health.
""This is a major project that will ensure the [Barrancabermeja] refinery continues to be the most sustainable in Latin America,” said Ricardo Roa Barragán, Ecopetrol’s chief executive officer and president.
Wood said it expects the Barrancabermeja refinery will begin first production of lower-sulfur gasoline from the LBCC project by 2030.
Ecopetrol previously undertook a series of major upgrades at Barrancabermeja valued at an overall investment of nearly $780 million in 2021 (OGJ Online, Feb. 19, 2021).","Majority state-owned Ecopetrol SA has let a contract to John Wood Group PLC to provide engineering works for a planned clean-fuels project at the operator’s 250,000-b/d Barrancabermeja refinery in Santander, Colombia.

As part of the June 19 contract, Wood will deliver detailed engineering design for associated upgrades as part of Ecopetrol’s Línea Base de Calidad de Combustibles (LBCC)—or fuel quality baseline—project, which is designed to improve the refinery’s quality of gasoline production, as well the site’s environmental performance, the service provider said.

Wood said its scope of work on the LBCC project will include redesigning existing processing infrastructure within the refinery to enable production of gasoline with notably reduced sulfur content complying with Colombia’s national targets for cleaner fuels, as well as ambitions to improve national air quality and health.

The proposed modifications at the refinery—which, as the nation’s main refining center, is responsible for producing more than 40% of domestically consumed fuels—will also play a critical role in the country achieving its energy transition targets of net-zero emissions by 2050, Wood and Ecopetrol said separately.

By 2030, Colombia’s energy plan calls for producing higher-octane gasoline with a reduced maximum-sulfur level of 10ppm accommodate entry of high-tech vehicles into the national market, as well as contribute to lower emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere.

The LBCC project specifically will ensure compliance with Colombia’s Ministries of Mines and Energy and Environment and Sustainable Development’s Resolution 40444 of 2023, which established a path to improving the national quality of diesel and gasoline to support increased environmental protection and improve health of Colombian citizens, Ecopetrol said in a Mar. 25 release.

LBCC project details

Officially approved by the company’s board in March 2025 at total investment of about $1.2 billion for allocation during the next few years, Barrancabermeja’s LBCC upgrading project will—alongside enabling output of lower-carbon gasoline—also equip the refinery to produce lower-emission hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

""This is a major project that will ensure the [Barrancabermeja] refinery continues to be the most sustainable in Latin America,” said Ricardo Roa Barragán, Ecopetrol’s chief executive officer and president.

“[The upgrading and revamp project will equip the refinery] to achieve greater production autonomy, produce cleaner [and] lighter gasoline, and support the [site’s] decarbonization [efforts in line with] the energy transition,"" Roa Barragán added.

Ecopetrol said internal calculations indicate Barrancabermeja’s LBCC project could reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by about 4.5 million tonnes/year (tpy)—equivalent to planting nearly 207 million trees annually—and help lower Colombia’s overall CO2-equivalent emissions by 5.3%.

The project additionally could reduce emissions of other pollutants such as nitrous oxide (NOx), sulfur oxide (SOx), and carbon monoxide (CO) by about 90,000 tpy, which equates to an emissions-reduction rate for these pollutants of about a 2.7% from current levels, according to the operator.

Alongside spurring economic growth in the region, Ecopetrol said its level of investment in the LBCC project combined with the technical, operational, and logistical complexities involved in the project will also help create new employment opportunities for both skilled and unskilled workers on a regional and national basis.

Wood said it expects the Barrancabermeja refinery will begin first production of lower-sulfur gasoline from the LBCC project by 2030.

It is vital we advance policies which increase flexibility for the market to meet demand while opening the door to American energy affordability.","By Rep. Adrian Smith

As American families make travel plans and assess energy costs for their farms and businesses during the summer, it is as important as ever to champion domestic production of affordable fuels. While gasoline prices in Nebraska are down 5.6 percent from this time a year ago, and diesel prices are down 5.8 percent, tensions around the world put supply chains and energy security at risk. In light of this, policies which embrace the capacity of American biofuels producers to meet demand, such as year-round availability of ethanol blends of 15 percent (E15), are crucial for an all-of-the-above, winning strategy for American energy affordability.

According to Growth Energy analysis, E15 has the potential to save American drivers $20.6 billion in annual fuel costs and generate $66.3 billion for U.S. gross domestic product. My bill with Senator Deb Fischer, the Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act, would end the unnecessary cycle of dependance on summertime waivers from the EPA and permanently allow year-round, nationwide sale of E15. Our legislation does not have the effect of a mandate. It simply removes existing unscientific restrictions on E15 sales.

I am grateful last week the Trump administration rightfully recognized the key role biofuels play in American energy security when the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced its proposed Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) volume requirements for 2026 and 2027. In May, I wrote to President Trump with 25 colleagues calling for timely and robust renewable volume obligation (RVO) requirements, and I look forward to working with EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and the president to ensure these proposed RVO levels have the intended effect of promoting American energy production. If finalized, these RFS volumes will support our agriculture producers, provide much needed certainty to the industry, and ensure consumers have greater access to affordable liquid fuels.

Remarkably, the overall economic impact of the ethanol industry for our state is $8.18 billion—more than 50 times the total impact of the 2024 College World Series, which itself is wonderful for our economy. Because of the importance of biofuels to Nebraska’s economy and energy abundance, I supported inclusion of a provision in the House-passed reconciliation package to extend and improve the 45Z biofuels production tax credit through 2031. This measure directly supports farmers in the Third District and equips producers with the certainty to invest and power the future of sustainable aviation fuel and other clean transportation fuel.

In addition, last week the Trump administration took action to halt production at the EPA’s red tape factory and restore energy abundance. Under Administrator Zeldin, the EPA has proposed a rule to eliminate the previous administration’s “Clean Power Plan 2.0,” which threatened to undermine grid reliability and inflate costs for Nebraskans, who get about half our state’s electricity from coal. Also, President Trump signed into law a resolution I supported which rescinded an EPA waiver granted under President Biden. The waiver permitted the State of California’s electric vehicle mandate which functionally banned the sale of vehicles powered by internal combustion. These Biden-era rules were unworkable, out of touch, and a step backward for American energy.

As co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Biofuels Caucus, I am committed to maximizing accessibility of renewable fuels and flexibility for American producers, consumers, and retailers.

This agreement aims to make it easier for airlines to get access to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which is considered better for the environment than traditional jet fuel, reports Aviacion al dia.

The two companies will work together to set up systems that allow airlines, even those in remote areas, to get this fuel more easily. They will also help airlines understand how to use SAF within the rules that apply to air travel, without affecting their regular operations.

Since not all airlines can get direct access to SAF, ATR and ATOBA ENERGY will also use a system that lets airlines receive credit for using eco-friendly fuel, even if it’s not the exact fuel going into their planes. This system is based on a method that helps companies track and reduce their overall impact on the environment.

ATR’s Chief Executive Officer, Nathalie Tarnaud Laude, said that using cleaner fuel is one of the best ways to cut pollution from flying in the short and medium term. She pointed out that many smaller airlines struggle to get SAF, and this partnership is meant to fix that problem and make the fuel available to airlines all over the world.

Arnaud Namer, the head of ATOBA ENERGY, said he was proud to be part of a plan that gives all airlines a chance to use cleaner fuel. He explained that their method allows airlines, no matter where they are located, to reduce the amount of pollution they cause.

This effort is part of ATR’s bigger goal to make all of its planes ready to run entirely on sustainable fuel by the year 2030. This goal supports international efforts to fight climate change and is being developed with help from local and national governments.

The agreement also aims to improve trust in the aviation industry by sharing clear and accurate information about how this fuel affects the environment. By being open about the fuel’s benefits, ATR and ATOBA ENERGY hope to help more airlines make better choices for the planet.

This innovative initiative allows Airbus business travelers to reduce the environmental impact of their trips. The option is available directly through their booking tool.

Following the success of a pilot project in 2023, Air France-KLM and Airbus are strengthening their collaboration with a dedicated SAF fare agreement. Airbus has committed to purchasing SAF options for its employees’ business travel by joining Air France-KLM’s “SAF Corporate” program for the third consecutive year, a program that facilitates the funding and purchase of SAF.

Since the beginning of 2025, Air France-KLM has offered Airbus employees the opportunity to finance a percentage of SAF during the booking process on a selection of routes frequently used by the Group, such as Toulouse-Paris and Toulouse-Montreal, where Airbus has a production facility. This option, visible at the time of booking, aims to raise individual awareness among employees about efforts to reduce CO2 emissions related to business travel.

Since joining the SAF program in November 2023, Airbus has reduced its CO2 emissions by more than 2,000 tons through the purchase of over 670 tons of SAF. This approach offers employees a concrete opportunity to reduce the carbon footprint of their business travel.

Sébastien Guyot, Executive Vice President Global Sales at Air France-KLM, stated: “Reducing our CO2 emissions is a priority for our Group. Sustainable aviation fuel is essential to achieving our ambitions, and the contribution of our corporate customers, like Airbus, is crucial.”

The 45Z production tax credit is critical to putting American energy production and farmers first.
It will help SAF producers establish new markets for farmers to sell their sustainably produced crops, rewarding farmers for their investments in regenerative agriculture.
This is critical to putting America first and securing new opportunities for Iowa farmers.
We are on the cusp of an energy revolution driven by Iowa farmers and biofuel producers.","Being a farmer in Iowa is no easy feat, and the last few years have presented new challenges. The value of Iowa farms was down 3.1% last year due to lower crop prices, increased interest rates, and high labor and supply costs.

If we don’t change course, this will have community-wide effects on the entire ag economy—in Iowa and across the country. Thankfully, supportive federal policy for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production could provide farmers like me new opportunities to stay in the game.

The 45Z production tax credit is critical to putting American energy production and farmers first. It will help SAF producers establish new markets for farmers to sell their sustainably produced crops, rewarding farmers for their investments in regenerative agriculture. For example, when farmers sell their crops as feedstocks to SAF producers, they can expect to earn up to an additional 20 cents per bushel of sustainably grown corn.

Many farmers, including myself, have adopted cutting-edge practices and technologies that allow us to efficiently and sustainably produce more crops per acre while also growing our bottom line. The market incentive to adopt these practices is clear and compelling: beyond the sizable market demand for sequestering carbon, these practices save us valuable time and money relative to more traditional methods.

By leveraging practices like low- or no-till farming systems, improved fertilizer management, and conservation crop rotation, farmers can improve crop and soil health while increasing efficiencies and profitability. This means that even amidst volatile growing conditions, farms are prepared to withstand shock and remain economically viable.

The U.S. House of Representatives, thanks to the leadership of the Iowa delegation, included a provision in its budget bill to extend the 45Z credit through 2031. This is critical to putting America first and securing new opportunities for Iowa farmers. Farmers across the country applaud the House for its support of this credit and urge the Senate to ensure this provision becomes law. Securing this extension would not only allow SAF producers to attract and sustain the financing needed to scale the next generation of aviation fuel. It would also ensure this nascent industry can thrive and support American energy security.

These practices are the future of farming—providing farmers with an economic and environmental edge. In 2023 alone, Iowan farmers earned more than$9.5 billion by selling corn as feedstock to biofuel producers.

American farmers are ready to deliver wins for America and strengthen our domestic energy security, but we need these markets for biofuels like SAF to grow and thrive. These fuels are ready to be used today in existing aircraft and airport fueling infrastructure, simplifying adoption. By helping to launch this nascent industry, policymakers can give American biofuel producers and aviation the competitive edge needed to win on a global stage.

As a third-generation farmer in Iowa, it's essential to find new demand, like SAF, for our corn. Thanks to technological advances and sound farming practices, we continue to raise more corn on fewer acres of land with fewer fertilizer inputs. My son, a fourth-generation farmer on this land, is now farming with me, and it is paramount that we find new markets to use the higher production that we are realizing. Without new markets like SAF, it will be difficult to sustain the next generation in our operation.

We are on the cusp of an energy revolution driven by Iowa farmers and biofuel producers. As Congress acts on required tax legislation this year, it is critical it implements and extends the 45Z credit in that package. Representatives Randy Feenstra, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Ashley Hinson, and Zach Nunn have done their due diligence on the 45Z extension. With continued support from Senator Joni Ernst and Senator Chuck Grassley, Iowa can remain an energy leader while creating new opportunities for our farmers and bolstering our local communities.

In an increasingly turbulent world, Azerbaijan’s air corridors are poised to become enduring lifelines for global connectivity.","The global aviation industry is undergoing a profound transformation as escalating geopolitical tensions and regional conflicts disrupt long-standing East-West air corridors. The full-scale war in Ukraine and rising hostilities in the Middle East have forced airlines to abandon traditional flight routes, resulting in longer journeys, higher operational costs, and increased carbon emissions.

In this environment of uncertainty, the search for stable, efficient, and politically neutral transit alternatives has become an urgent priority for global carriers. Against this backdrop, Azerbaijan has rapidly emerged as a critical aviation link between Asia and Europe. Positioned at the heart of the Eurasian landmass, the country offers not only geographic advantage but also modern infrastructure, diplomatic neutrality, and a clear vision for sustainable and multimodal connectivity. As traditional air corridors unravel, Azerbaijan is positioning itself not as a temporary substitute but as a long-term, strategic hub shaping the future of Eurasian aviation.

The full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 fundamentally altered global aviation patterns. Western airlines, banned from Russian airspace, were compelled to adopt significantly longer routes between Europe or North America and East Asia. This rerouting has had substantial environmental and economic consequences.

Research indicates that these detours led to planes using an average of 13% more fuel compared to their original routes, with flights specifically between Europe and Asia experiencing an even greater increase of 14.8% in fuel consumption. This operational adjustment contributed to a 1% increase in global aviation carbon dioxide emissions in 2023, adding an estimated 8.2 million tonnes of CO2 to the atmosphere. Approximately 1,100 flights per day were affected by these airspace restrictions, underscoring a systemic disruption rather than isolated incidents.

Layered onto the disruptions caused by the Ukraine war, the escalating tensions and direct missile exchanges between Israel and Iran have led to immediate and widespread airspace closures across the Middle East, including over Iran, Iraq, Jordan, and Israel. This has resulted in major disruptions, forcing international airlines to cancel or reroute hundreds of flights. Over 500 flights were cancelled or delayed across major Middle Eastern airports due to these restrictions. Major carriers such as Air India, Qatar Airways, Emirates, Lufthansa, FlyDubai, Etihad, and El Al were significantly affected, with many flights rerouted or even returned to their origin points. This situation, combined with the Ukraine war, effectively closes or severely restricts a second critical East-West corridor, dramatically reducing available safe airspace and forcing airlines into increasingly constrained and circuitous routes.

The immediate diversion of numerous international flights to Heydar Aliyev International Airport (GYD) in Baku during the Middle East airspace restrictions demonstrates Azerbaijan’s role as a reliable haven. Baku Airport explicitly stated its capacity to “safely reroute regional and global air traffic under any emergency circumstances,” possessing “all the necessary infrastructure and operational resources.” This spontaneous rerouting signifies a high level of trust in Azerbaijan’s air traffic control, ground services, and its perceived geopolitical neutrality. It elevates Azerbaijan from a theoretical alternative to a proven, real-time crisis response hub, showcasing its immediate utility and strategic value in volatile times.

Azerbaijan’s emergence as a pivotal East-West air connector is not merely a reactive response to current crises but is rooted in its unique geographical advantages, rich historical legacy, and a carefully cultivated foreign policy. Strategically located at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, bridging the Caspian Sea and the South Caucasus, Azerbaijan naturally positions itself as a critical transit point for goods and people moving between the two continents.

At the heart of this positioning is the “Middle Corridor,” also known as the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route, which stretches across Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, and the South Caucasus into Europe. Azerbaijan forms its crucial central link. The nation’s strength as an air hub is not isolated but is part of a broader, integrated national strategy to become a comprehensive multimodal logistics center, offering seamless transfers between air, rail, road, and sea networks.

Since regaining independence in 1991, Azerbaijan has diligently pursued a foreign policy centered on connectivity and cooperation, consistently emphasizing regional stability. Its commitment to neutrality is a cornerstone of its appeal as a safe transit corridor. Amidst escalating Israeli-Iranian confrontation, Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov explicitly stated that “Azerbaijan will never allow its territory to be used for attacks against friendly states, including Iran.” This declaration of neutrality, coupled with its active participation in organizations like the UN, OSCE, and the Organization of Turkic States, reinforces its commitment to regional stability and cooperation. This proactive approach and sustained commitment to infrastructure development, rather than merely reacting to crises, instill greater confidence in its reliability as a hub.

Azerbaijan’s commitment to becoming a leading aviation hub is visibly supported by substantial investments in modern infrastructure and advanced operational capabilities. Heydar Aliyev International Airport (GYD) in Baku has undergone significant modernization and achieved remarkable growth, solidifying its position as the region’s leading aviation hub. In 2024, the airport served 7.5 million passengers, marking a substantial 31% increase compared to 2023. Transit travel, a key indicator of its hub status, saw exceptional growth, with the number of transit passengers rising by an impressive 130% to 373,383. The airport handled 59,238 flights and expanded its route network to 80 destinations, served by 40 airlines. This growth and operational excellence have garnered significant international recognition, with GYD named the “Best Airport in Central Asia and the CIS” by the prestigious Skytrax World Airport Awards.

Furthermore, the new Alat Cargo Airport, located within the Alat Free Economic Zone (AFEZ), is designed to become a critical multimodal logistics hub, further strengthening Azerbaijan’s position as a key transit point between Europe and Asia. Equipped with state-of-the-art air navigation systems by Indra, it will enhance operational efficiency and ensure flight safety for round-the-clock cargo operations. This airport is strategically located adjacent to the Port of Baku and directly linked to Azerbaijan’s railway and highway networks, facilitating seamless cargo movement across sea, land, and air.

Beyond Baku, Azerbaijan’s commitment to modernizing its air traffic control (ATC) systems and expanding its airport network extends to other regions. Fuzuli International Airport, for instance, built within an impressive eight months, was inaugurated in 2021, serving as Karabakh’s gateway to the world. It features a 3,000m runway, instrumental landing and navigation systems, and an ATC tower equipped with an automated PHOENIX tower system, all complying with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) regulations. Azeraeronavigation (AZANS) serves as the national air navigation service provider, ensuring safe and efficient air traffic services across the country’s airspace.

Azerbaijan’s emergence as a key air transit hub is intrinsically linked to its broader national economic strategy, with aviation serving as a critical catalyst for diversification and sustainable growth. The Azerbaijani government’s strategic focus on air transport reflects its broader goal to diversify the economy beyond its traditional reliance on oil and gas. A State Program is in place to enhance the efficiency of logistics processes, making air transport more accessible and reliable for businesses, aiming to attract crucial foreign investments.

Furthermore, expanding air transport capabilities is expected to bolster tourism significantly. Azerbaijan was indeed the fastest-growing tourism destination among the 30 largest European destinations, recording a 26% increase in air bookings between May 2023 and April 2024 and May 2024 and April 2025. This growing passenger demand complements transit traffic, strengthening the overall viability and profitability of aviation operations.

Azerbaijan has also made sustainability and the transition to a green economy central to its long-term national development strategy. In alignment with this vision, Azerbaijan Airlines (AZAL) has announced a major initiative to explore the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as part of its commitment to reducing carbon emissions and advancing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. AZAL is actively engaging with financial institutions to attract green investment and is developing a comprehensive ESG strategy. It has also joined the International Air Transport Association (IATA)’s CO₂ Connect program, further reinforcing its environmental leadership.

Moreover, AZAL has unveiled ambitious plans to modernize its fleet and enhance operational efficiency, with new Airbus and Boeing aircraft expected by 2032. The airline plans to streamline its fleet by 2030 to include only two models: the narrow-body Airbus A320 Neo family and the wide-body Boeing 787 Dreamliner. This strategic investment in a modern, fuel-efficient fleet will further enhance Azerbaijan’s appeal as a transit hub, offering airlines and passengers access to contemporary and reliable air transport services.

As global aviation navigates a new era of uncertainty and fragmentation, Azerbaijan has emerged not as a peripheral alternative but as a central pillar in reconfiguring East-West air connectivity. Its unique geographical position, coupled with a long-term strategy rooted in neutrality, infrastructure investment, and sustainable development, has elevated the country into a key node in global air transit. The convergence of geopolitical crises—from the war in Ukraine to instability in the Middle East—has underscored the urgency of identifying stable, efficient, and geopolitically neutral corridors.

Azerbaijan’s swift, coordinated response to these challenges, demonstrated through both policy and performance, reveals its growing capacity to anchor regional and intercontinental aviation flows. With state-of-the-art infrastructure, a rapidly expanding airport network, strategic policy vision, and a commitment to green transformation, Azerbaijan is not merely adapting to shifting global dynamics; it is actively shaping them. In an increasingly turbulent world, Azerbaijan’s air corridors are poised to become enduring lifelines for global connectivity.",https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/c-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 14:05:21.669349

It has partnered with Airbus to use Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for all domestic flights of Airbus employees in Germany. This collaboration, which started on June 1, is key to Lufthansa’s climate neutrality goals.

The press release highlights that this partnership uses Lufthansa’s “Sustainable Corporate Value Fare.” This fare helps companies like Airbus offset CO₂ emissions by using SAF in the airline’s fuel operations.

Dieter Vranckx, Chief Commercial Officer of Lufthansa Group, said,

“Together with our customers and strong partners from the industry, we strive towards greater sustainability. I am particularly pleased and thankful that our long-standing partner Airbus has opted for a corporate fare with SAF, demonstrating its leading role also in the field of sustainability. For many companies and its employees, sustainability is becoming an increasingly important factor in travel decisions. As a leading airline group, we are the partner of choice for companies in achieving their goals with tailor-made solutions.”

How It Works: A Smarter Way to Fly Greener

SAF isn’t used directly in individual flights. Instead, it blends with fossil kerosene before reaching airports. As a “drop-in” fuel, SAF fits easily into existing aircraft and fuel systems. Once purchased, Lufthansa ensures that the equivalent SAF related to the customer’s carbon footprint is used within six months.

This method cuts the emissions impact of flying, even if SAF isn’t used on one flight. Over its lifecycle, SAF made from biogenic waste reduces CO₂ emissions by about 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

Airbus Walks the Talk: Making Employee Travel Sustainable

By adopting the Sustainable Corporate Value Fare, Airbus is making employee travel within Germany more climate-friendly. This reflects a growing trend where more companies choose climate responsibility in travel.

Raphael Duflos, Vice President Corporate Services Procurement at Airbus, also noted,

“We have been working in close cooperation with Lufthansa Group since early 2024 to customize their ‘Sustainable Corporate Value Fare’ to meet the specific needs of Airbus travelers. They have helped us to create a meaningful offer incorporating Sustainable Aviation Fuels, starting in the German domestic market. We are confident that such ‘Sustainable Corporate Value Fare’ is going to be successful across the Business Travel ecosystem.”

For Lufthansa, this shows that its climate-focused travel products attract business customers.

Supports SAF to Cut Emissions and Drive Industry Growth

Airbus is using SAF as a key solution to reduce its aviation emissions. It is promoting SAF not just through internal use, but also by forming partnerships and making targeted investments.

Airbus Sustainability

The aviation giant has been using SAF for nearly a decade and aims to cover at least 30% of its internal fuel use with SAF by 2030. This includes fuel for internal transport and employee business travel. Notably, all current Airbus aircraft can fly on up to 50% SAF.

By 2030, the goal is for all aircraft and helicopters to be ready for 100% SAF. New single-aisle models are already being designed with this goal in mind.

Since 2024, Airbus has purchased SAF options from Air France-KLM for employee flights between Paris and cities like Hamburg, Madrid, Marseille, Munich, and Toulouse.

Pilot Projects with Airlines

To help scale SAF use, the company launched two pilot projects last year. One with easyJet funded 106 tonnes of SAF for flights between Toulouse and Bristol using a 30% SAF blend. The trial showed how airlines and corporate partners can share SAF costs and build demand.

Another trial with Wizz Air included over 50 flights using blended SAF, with Airbus providing technical support.

Long-Term Partnerships

Airbus has also partnered with TotalEnergies, which has supplied SAF for aircraft deliveries in Toulouse since 2016. By 2024, TotalEnergies met over half of Airbus’s SAF needs in Europe. They are also working together on research to enable 100% SAF use.

In recent years, Airbus signed agreements with Neste and OMV to expand access to SAF, encourage new demand, and support new production sites. It also invested in LanzaJet, a leading SAF producer, to help speed up the transition across the industry.

Lufthansa’s Climate Targets: Big Ambitions, Concrete Steps

The airline has clear climate goals. It plans to cut net CO₂ emissions from flights by half by 2030, compared to 2019 levels. It also aims for net-zero by 2050 and carbon neutrality in its home market by 2030.

SAF Use Grows Across Lufthansa’s Network

In 2024, Lufthansa cut 71,952 tonnes of fossil CO₂ by using SAF.

The sustainability report shows that the fuel was sourced through co-processing, where biogenic feedstock is refined alongside fossil crude oil. This method helps scale SAF efficiently while maintaining high quality.

Corporate clients can access SAF in two main ways:

Sustainable Corporate Value Fare: Business travelers can offset up to 30% of their CO₂ emissions through SAF.

SAF Bulk Deals: Companies can invest in larger SAF volumes to maximize their climate impact.

Expanding Green Fares for Leisure and Business Travelers

Lufthansa’s Green Fares product expanded in December 2024 to include intercontinental routes. On these flights, 10% of emissions are offset using SAF, while 90% through certified climate projects. For continental routes, the mix is even more ambitious: 20% SAF and 80% offsets.

The response has been modest but is growing. In 2024, about 4% of customers chose Green Fares on continental routes and 1.5% on long-haul flights.

These fares led to a total reduction or offset of 143,000 tonnes of fossil CO₂, with 28,000 tonnes saved directly through SAF.

A Multi-Faced Approach to Sustainability

Lufthansa’s climate strategy goes beyond SAF. It combines technology upgrades, operational efficiency, and better ground logistics:

1. Fleet Modernization: The Group has updated its fleet with new aircraft like the Airbus A320neo, A321neo, A350-900, and Boeing 787-9. These planes have new engines and materials that lower emissions and noise.

In 2024, Lufthansa added 18 new aircraft and retired four older models.

By 2025, 30 more new aircraft are expected.

The modernization plan covers around 240 aircraft. 99.6% of the fleet meets ICAO’s Chapter 4 noise standards.

2. Flight Operation Efficiency: Through smarter routing and digital tools, Lufthansa cut 37,000 tonnes of CO₂ in 2024. Innovations like AeroSHARK surface technology saved 12,000 tonnes of kerosene—enough for 142 roundtrips between Munich and New York with an Airbus A350-900.

3. Alternative Transport to Hubs: Lufthansa has reduced short-haul flights by offering over 750 daily connections via rail or bus. In 2024, over 1.1 million passengers chose these low-emission options, cutting unnecessary air traffic.

4. Offsetting Where Necessary: Besides SAF and fuel savings, Lufthansa and its customers actively offset emissions. In 2024, they offset 606,000 tonnes of CO₂ using high-quality climate projects—531,000 tonnes by customers and 75,000 tonnes from Lufthansa’s travel.

Sustainable Travel Becomes Mainstream

The Airbus-Lufthansa agreement signals a shift in aviation’s approach to travel. With scalable SAF programs, new aircraft, and changing passenger expectations, Lufthansa is positioning itself as a sustainability leader.

Real change needs collective effort. For aviation to meet climate goals, it requires increased SAF production and broader adoption by travelers.

Why Are Carbon-Neutral Fuels Emerging as a Critical Solution in the Global Energy Transition?

As the global community intensifies efforts to combat climate change, carbon-neutral fuels are gaining prominence as a vital pathway toward decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors. These fuels produced using renewable energy sources and designed to release no net carbon emissions during their lifecycle are increasingly seen as a bridge between existing fossil fuel infrastructure and a fully electrified future. Unlike conventional fossil fuels, carbon-neutral fuels such as green hydrogen, synthetic e-fuels, and biofuels derived from waste biomass can provide a drop-in alternative with minimal modifications to engines, distribution systems, or fueling stations. This compatibility is crucial for sectors like aviation, shipping, and long-haul trucking, where direct electrification remains technically or economically challenging.

Governments and climate pacts like the Paris Agreement are applying pressure through carbon pricing, emissions targets, and clean fuel mandates, incentivizing rapid adoption and innovation in carbon-neutral technologies. With rising global energy demand and growing skepticism over the pace of electrification, carbon-neutral fuels offer a pragmatic, scalable alternative that aligns environmental goals with industrial reality. Furthermore, these fuels can be synthesized using carbon captured from the atmosphere or industrial processes, enabling a closed-loop carbon cycle that supports global net-zero ambitions. As the urgency to act on emissions intensifies, carbon-neutral fuels are moving from concept to commercial deployment, becoming a linchpin in the strategy to decouple energy consumption from carbon output.

What Policy Measures and Market Trends Are Accelerating Adoption?

The policy landscape is evolving rapidly to support the growth of carbon-neutral fuels, with governments, international agencies, and private-sector coalitions all playing pivotal roles. In Europe, the Renewable Energy Directive II and Fit for 55 package mandate a rising share of renewable and low-carbon fuels in transportation, including aviation and maritime sectors. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law offer tax credits and funding for clean hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) projects, while Canada, Japan, and South Korea have unveiled national hydrogen strategies with strong incentives for carbon-neutral fuel development. Carbon pricing mechanisms such as the EU Emissions Trading System are making fossil fuels more expensive to use, indirectly boosting demand for cleaner alternatives.

Meanwhile, corporate commitments to net-zero targets are prompting major logistics, airline, and energy firms to invest in long-term supply agreements for carbon-neutral fuels. International aviation bodies like ICAO are setting SAF adoption targets, while maritime regulators push for low-carbon fuel usage across shipping lanes. Financial markets are also playing a role, with green bonds and climate-aligned investment funds directing capital toward fuel innovation projects.

On the consumer side, increased awareness of carbon footprints is driving demand for sustainable travel and low-emission delivery options, indirectly influencing fuel sourcing. These policy and market shifts are creating a favorable ecosystem for carbon-neutral fuels to scale moving the conversation from niche pilot projects to global industrial deployment, and establishing the regulatory certainty needed for long-term infrastructure investments.

What's Powering the Growth of the Global Carbon-Neutral Fuels Market?

The growth in the carbon-neutral fuels market is driven by several intertwined factors spanning environmental targets, industrial demand, technological viability, and strategic policy support. At the core is the global push toward net-zero emissions, with more than 140 countries and thousands of corporations committing to carbon neutrality by mid-century. This sweeping commitment is translating into direct demand for low-emission alternatives in sectors that cannot easily electrify aviation, marine shipping, heavy manufacturing, and long-haul freight. On the technology side, the rapid maturation of green hydrogen electrolysis, CO2-to-fuel conversion, and biomass gasification is enabling large-scale, commercially viable production pathways.

From an end-use perspective, industries are eager to decarbonize without overhauling existing infrastructure, making drop-in carbon-neutral fuels an attractive proposition. Consumer and corporate behavior is evolving, with rising scrutiny of Scope 3 emissions, greater interest in sustainable sourcing, and ESG frameworks pushing companies to adopt low-carbon fuel solutions. Policy support is equally vital, with tax incentives, fuel blending mandates, infrastructure funding, and clean energy subsidies helping bridge the economic gap between conventional and carbon-neutral fuels.

Additionally, geopolitical concerns over energy security and fuel independence are prompting many nations to invest in local, renewables-based fuel production, reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels. International cooperation through climate accords and technology-sharing partnerships is further accelerating knowledge transfer and deployment. Together, these drivers are not only propelling the carbon-neutral fuels market forward but are also positioning it as a foundational pillar of the emerging global green energy economy.

This step marks a strategic milestone in OMV Petrom’s transition towards sustainable energy solutions.

According to the statement submitted to the Bucharest Stock Exchange, the supply contract spans a five-year period beginning in 2028, with an option for a three-year extension. Deliveries of the pre-treated used cooking oil will commence in 2028, supporting the refinery’s SAF production goals. Pricing for the supply is determined by a formula linked to international market quotations, ensuring adaptability to market dynamics.

OMV Petrom emphasized that the agreement allows for the procurement of up to 0.6 million tonnes of feedstock, with an estimated contract value exceeding EUR 700 million (approximately $803.1 million), based on current market rates. This agreement complements a previous deal signed in June 2024 for pre-treated vegetable oil, enabling the company to secure over 80% of the necessary raw materials for the first eight years of SAF and Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) production at the Petrobrazi facility.

The Petrobrazi refinery, located near Ploiesti in southern Romania, is undergoing a transformation with the construction of a new sustainable fuels plant. The facility, which began development in February, involves an investment of EUR 560 million and is scheduled to become operational in 2028. It will have an annual production capacity of 250,000 tonnes, supplying both SAF and HVO.

This major supply contract underlines OMV Petrom’s firm commitment to developing a long-term, sustainable feedstock supply chain for its low-carbon fuel initiatives. It also aligns with broader industry trends that aim to decarbonize the aviation sector through the use of renewable energy sources.

In terms of financial outlook, OMV Petrom has also demonstrated continued investment momentum. In April, the company approved a capital expenditure budget of 8.1 billion lei (around $1.847 billion or EUR 1.61 billion) for 2025, representing a more than 20% increase compared to the previous year. However, the company reported a net profit of 1.07 billion lei in the first quarter of 2025, marking a 24% decline year-on-year.

As of 14:11 CET on Thursday, OMV Petrom’s shares were trading 0.66% lower at 0.755 lei on the Bucharest Stock Exchange.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-20 16:06:46.896456

Speaking at the biennial Paris Air Show this week Nathalie Tarnaud Laud, chief executive of ATR, said aircraft orders have continued to show a positive trend this year.
Having secured orders for 30 new aircraft so far in 2025, ATR has now sold over 1,900 aircraft since the start of the 72-600 programme.
“We are very optimistic about the commercial performance going forward but still pragmatic when it comes to restoring the supply chain and delivering those aircraft,” Tarnaud Laud said.
Tarnaud Laud said this is “setting a new standard for fuel efficiency and sustainability”.","Regional aircraft manufacturer ATR is preparing for a year of ramping up deliveries of its 72-600s in 2026 following a year of stabilising operations.

Speaking at the biennial Paris Air Show this week Nathalie Tarnaud Laud, chief executive of ATR, said aircraft orders have continued to show a positive trend this year.

Having secured orders for 30 new aircraft so far in 2025, ATR has now sold over 1,900 aircraft since the start of the 72-600 programme. A recent order for 19 from Uni AIR was the largest since 2017.

Tarnaud Laud said this shows the trust customers are placing in ATR which she said it working on improving the product in terms of sustainability and maintenance.

She said ATR has a “really strong pipeline” and the second half of 2025 will ensure it out-performs last year “which was a really good year in terms of orders”.

“We are very optimistic about the commercial performance going forward but still pragmatic when it comes to restoring the supply chain and delivering those aircraft,” Tarnaud Laud said.

“We said at the beginning of the year that 2025 will be a year of stabilisation and I can confirm we are still on track to stabilise the deliveries from last year.

“This year is also a year of preparing for the future. We want to ramp up, that’s very clear. And that’s why we have continued a lot of effort in improving our processes, in the way we work with our suppliers to start that ramp up in 2026.”

Tarnaud Laud added: “When it comes to product improvement for that this year we have decided to launch specifications which will continue to move forward the performance of the aircraft.

“The ATR is one of the most cost-effective aircraft operating on the close to 500 nautical miles. That’s why we decided to invest in a couple of improvements reducing costs and improving the availability of the aircraft.

“We have a few initiatives like reducing the corrosion on the aircraft increasing the checks from two to three years. This is a very important pillar for us and we want to achieve this in a time frame of two to three years.”

Tarnaud Laud said ATR also want to continue the sustainability journey, describing it as being “in the DNA of the company”. “We want to continue to lead the sustainability journey when it comes to regional aircraft.”

ATR is working with engine supplier Pratt & Whitney in two areas. The first is to improve the PW127XT’s fuel efficiency and maintenance costs.

The OEM is also working on alternative fuels including working with Pratt & Whitney on its Able concept for developing hydrogen propulsion.

ATR is also continuing to work on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) having been the first manufacturer to operate a 100% SAF flight in June 2022.

This week ATR signed a deal with French SAF aggregator ATOBA to address the key issue with SAF which is the cost and availability.

Tarnaud Laud said: “When it comes to reginal aviation on one side we are smaller players as customers …and access to SAF is not that easy so they need to join forces with others.

“On the other side you have the producers and, of course they are looking for scale, and they are looking for commitments. We want to work together with ATOBA to bring customers and producers together.”

ATR has achieved the EASA CS-CO2 certification which is based on stringent ICAO efficiency standards.

The 72-600 outperformed regulatory requirements delivering 20% margin beyond required criteria.

As the Senate continues to roll out its versions of the reconciliation bill, there are some differences between the House and Senate proposals when it come to agriculture.

The main variations come down to changes in the tax provisions, but it’s key to note proposed changes to the farm safety net are similar in both the House and the Senate.

What’s Next?

The House and Senate will now need to work out their differences in the two versions of the Big Beautiful Bill. President Trump said he wants to sign the legislation on July 4, but many reports cast doubt Congress can meet that approaching deadline. Politico even reported this week the Senate GOP’s version of the bill is “facing major headwinds in the House.”

Read More: Big, Beautiful Bill: What’s in it for Agriculture?

Farm CPA Paul Neiffer believes the July 4 deadline isn’t likely as the debate heats up, but he still remains optimistic the bill is close to the finish line.

“I think July is the date, but not July 4,” Neiffer says. “They’ll get it done before the August recess. I think they’re actually pretty close. The media out there talks about how they’re really far apart on Medicaid and state and local taxes. But I think when push comes to shove, the president has a lot of clout, and they’ll come up a compromise. So, I’m pretty optimistic they’ll get it done.”

Weighing the Differences Between the Senate and the House

Neiffer says he would grade the Senate’s overall budget reconciliation proposal as a “B” for ag, which is slightly below how he rated the House’s proposal. One reason is what the Senate is proposing for Section 199A:

The Senate has a Section 199A deduction of 20%, while the House’s version is 23%.

Both the House and Senate are calling for 100% bonus depreciation, but the Senate’s would be permanent. The House’s version would expire at the end of 2029.

“With the Senate making that permanent, that’s a really good deal for ag,” Neiffer says. “They would now have some certainty all of the assets that a farmer purchases — combines, tractors, buildings and everything but land — they can deduct 100%.”

Neiffer says another difference is on state and local tax deductions.

The Senate is keeping the current $10,000 deduction and reducing the benefit of the pass-through entity tax deduction.

The deduction is at the $40,000 level in the House and retains the pass-through entity deduction in full for farmers.

Beefed Up Farm Safety Net

Under the Senate’s version, Neiffer says farmers would be paid the higher calculated payment rate under Price Loss Coverage (PLC) or Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC) during the 2025 crop year.

The Senate Ag Committee’s proposal also increases the reference price formula, and instead of having a floor based on 85% of the Olympic moving average marketing year price, the Senate is proposing an increase up to 88%.

“That actually results in a boost on the corn PLC price by about $0.15. And I think on soybeans, it’s about $0.35,” Neiffer says. “So, that’s very beneficial. Now, I was hoping they were going to boost the ceiling. Right now, the ceiling is 115% of the EFR. And they had talked last year about boosting it up to 120%. I think that was too much for the budget, so they kept it at 115%.”

The Differences on 45Z

When it comes to the 45Z Clean Fuels Production Tax Credit, there’s one major difference. The Senate allows foreign feedstocks to be eligible for the credit, just with a 20% “haircut.”

In the House’s version, only feedstocks produced or grown in the United States or Canada qualify for the tax credit. That change would help detour some of the used cooking oil imports from China.

“To me, a 20% haircut means there’s got to be some senators out there maybe pandering to somebody that I don’t know about. Because really, they should eliminate the whole foreign feedstock and just give you a credit based on domestic production,” Neiffer says.

The Bigger Issue with 45Z

Peter Meyer of Muddy Boots Ag says no matter what version of the 45Z tax credit makes the final cut, there’s a bigger issue at hand. The Trump administration needs to provide guidance and rules around 45Z — something the Biden administration failed to do during its time in office.

“We’re just clamoring for clarification, right? All I want is clarification. They can say all they want about extending this to 2030. That’s great. That’s a positive. But tell me what the rules are. We still don’t know the rules,” Meyer says.

Meyer knows there’s been so much talk about 45Z and sustainable aviation fuel, but little action in terms of demand. Meyer says the lack of action in terms of demand is largely because there’s no clarity around the tax credit.

“We need more demand for the ethanol they’re producing,” Meyer says. “Soybean oil can be converted to sustainable aviation fuel. But you just cannot produce sustainable aviation fuel without a credit. You can’t.”",https://assets.farmjournal.com/dims4/default/fa50f97/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x720+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-farm-journal.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff1%2F73%2Fbc32110546e598783ace1a9bcece%2F4a3b34e2eff74d24bc4f64372b05c4d1%2Fposter.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 11:05:43.916077

The business is still in its very early stages

One thing investors need to be aware of is that while there are significant opportunities for Archer, it still has to obtain approval for its Midnight aircraft, and for it to produce it at scale. It has obtained multiple approvals from the Federal Aviation Administration thus far, and the hope is that it may not be too long until the aircraft is cleared for use in the U.S.

But even if that happens, the company still needs to ramp up production. The Midnight aircraft can accommodate four passengers, so the company will need to develop a considerable fleet before it can truly become a big player in the air taxi industry. Its goal is to be producing 650 aircraft per year by the end of the decade. This year, it's aiming to get to just two per month.

Since it's so early in its development, Archer isn't generating any revenue thus far, and its losses have totaled $514 million over the past four quarters. The good news is the business is already seeing strong demand, with a backlog of around $6 billion thus far, including United Airlines, which has ordered 200 of Archer's eVTOL aircraft already, plus an option for 100 more.

Is a valuation of $220 billion a possibility for Archer?

If Archer proves to be a 40x investment, its valuation would need to reach more than $220 billion in the future, given its current market cap of around $5.6 billion. If air taxis truly revolutionize travel and demand for Archer's aircraft takes off, that can be a possibility in the very long run.

But that's a scenario that's also riddled with multiple ifs. The necessary infrastructure needs to be built, and air spaces would become more crowded, which could result in greater legislation and red tape along the way. And with the company still in the early stages of producing its aircraft, it's also difficult to know what kind of margins it will make on them and how profitable the business may or may not be.

A lot of things would need to go right for the business for it to be worth well over $200 billion. Forecasting the future for an industry that's still in its infancy is not easy. And while there's certainly potential for Archer's valuation to grow significantly, investors shouldn't assume that the stock is destined for greatness and that it can generate 40x returns, even over the very long term.

Should you invest in Archer stock today?

Even though investing in Archer may not be a surefire path to becoming a millionaire, it may still be a growth stock worth adding to your portfolio. If you're comfortable with the risk and uncertainty that comes with this business, it could make for a good buy-and-hold investment.

However, given the risk involved, I wouldn't suggest investing more than 5% of your portfolio into the stock. By allocating just a modest amount of money into Archer, you can limit your losses while still giving yourself the possibility to benefit from its growth in the long run.

These deals underscore a global shift toward fuel-efficient, sustainable aircraft as airlines modernize fleets to meet rising passenger demand and stricter emissions regulations. For investors, these companies now offer leveraged exposure to two megatrends: the post-pandemic air travel rebound and the ESG-driven push for decarbonization. Here's why Airbus (AIR) and Embraer (EMBR3) are buys for long-term gains.

Airbus: Dominating Widebody Demand with $21B in Orders

Airbus's $21 billion in orders at the Paris Air Show—driven by Saudi Arabia's 25 A350-1000s and ANA Holdings' A321XLR deal—highlight its dominance in fuel-efficient widebody and long-haul aircraft. The A350 series, which now has over 1,390 orders globally, is the linchpin of this strategy. Its 25% lower fuel burn and full compliance with ICAO's 2027 CO₂ standards make it a must-have for airlines expanding premium routes.

Why It's a Buy:

- Structural Demand: Airlines like Riyadh Air (Saudi Arabia) and EGYPTAIR are prioritizing the A350 to meet long-haul growth and decarbonization targets.

- Zacks Growth Projections: Airbus's revenue is forecast to grow 10.4% annually through 2025, driven by A350 deliveries and expanding A321XLR adoption.

- ESG Tailwinds: Airbus aims for 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) compatibility by 2030—a key selling point as investors demand ESG-aligned assets.

Embraer: Regional Jets and Defense Deals Fuel 15.9% Growth

Embraer's $3.6 billion deal with SkyWest for 60 E175 regional jets (expandable to 110) and its KC-390 defense contract with Lithuania illustrate its dual strengths in commercial and military markets. The E175, a workhorse for short-haul routes, now has a 15-year backlog, while the KC-390 is gaining traction in NATO countries as a cost-effective transport aircraft.

Why It's a Buy:

- Insider Confidence: Embraer's shares surged 5% post-Paris Air Show, building on a 30% YTD gain and 150% rise in 2024. Institutional buying reflects confidence in its execution.

- Zacks Projections: Revenue growth of 15.9% annually through 2025 is backed by strong E-Jet backlog and KC-390's 50+ potential NATO orders.

- ESG Play: The E175's 20% fuel efficiency improvement over older models aligns with airlines' sustainability goals, ensuring long-term demand.

The Broader Investment Case: ESG-Driven Modernization

Both companies are beneficiaries of a $1.2 trillion global fleet modernization wave, as airlines retire older, less efficient aircraft. Airbus and Embraer are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this:

1. Airbus dominates widebody and freighter markets, critical for cargo growth and transoceanic routes.

2. Embraer dominates regional jets and defense logistics, serving underserved markets in Europe and Asia.

Risks to Consider

Supply Chain Delays: Both companies rely on global suppliers; disruptions could delay deliveries.

Regulatory Uncertainty: Emissions targets may shift, though both firms are ahead of compliance curves.

Competition: Boeing's 777X and Embraer's KC-390 face competition, but Airbus and Embraer's order backlogs suggest strong demand.

Investment Thesis

Airbus and Embraer are leveraged plays on rising air travel and ESG-driven fleet upgrades, with structural tailwinds and institutional support. Airbus (AIR) is ideal for investors seeking exposure to premium long-haul demand and SAF innovation, while Embraer (EMBR3) offers higher growth upside via its regional jets and defense contracts.

Recommendation:

Fortunately for United, encouraging trends in industry profitability and strong demand dynamics are a hedge in themselves, making me bullish on UAL in the second half of this year despite surging fuel prices.

Fuel Hedging Becomes UAL’s Insurance

For those unfamiliar, airline fuel hedging is a risk management strategy using financial instruments—such as futures or swaps—to lock in fuel prices for future delivery. Essentially, it acts as an insurance policy, providing cost stability amid volatile energy markets. Each airline adopts its own approach, adjusting based on broader economic and geopolitical conditions.

For example, Southwest Airlines (LUV) recently ended its once-active hedging program, reflecting a broader shift in the industry. United Airlines, meanwhile, has historically taken a minimal or opportunistic approach to hedging. This strategy is being tested as recent geopolitical tensions—particularly the missile exchanges between Iran and Israel—have pushed crude oil prices up by roughly 20% in the past month.

While oil remains about 8% cheaper year-over-year and has stabilized from its pandemic-era highs, any sharp spike in prices immediately impacts United’s bottom line. Fuel typically accounts for around 25% of an airline’s total operating costs, meaning price increases can significantly compress margins for carriers without substantial hedging in place.

UAL Supplements Hedging with Operational Excellence

It may come as a surprise to those who only interact with airlines as passengers, but the industry operates on razor-thin profit margins. In 2025, the average net profit margin across the sector was estimated at 3.7%, up slightly from 3.4% in 2024. United Airlines performed somewhat better than the industry average, posting a 5.5% profit margin in 2024—a relatively strong showing in such a margin-sensitive business.

Improving profit margins have given airlines like United the confidence to lean more heavily on “natural hedges” against fuel price volatility—strategies that focus on efficiency and sustainability rather than financial instruments. These include operational improvements such as operating newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft, eliminating physical magazines to reduce onboard weight, and utilizing single-engine taxiing to reduce fuel consumption on the ground.

United has been especially proactive in this area, aggressively modernizing its fleet and taking a leadership role in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) initiative to lower emissions and enhance long-term fuel efficiency.

These efforts are beginning to pay off. In its Q1 2025 earnings report, United posted record revenue of $13.2 billion, a 5.4% year-over-year increase, and generated over $2 billion in free cash flow, a testament to the strength of its operational strategy.

Strong Fundamentals Raise Expectations

Reflecting stronger net profit margins across the airline industry in 2025, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) is also forecasting record-high industry revenues. This outlook is supported by projected declines in fuel prices and continued improvements in operational efficiency. In April, global revenue passenger kilometers (RPK)—a key measure of air travel demand—rose 8% year-over-year, signaling robust consumer interest.

While fuel prices have spiked recently, IATA expects conditions to stabilize, projecting an average of $86 per barrel in 2025, down from $99 per barrel last year. With rising demand, falling fuel costs, and ongoing efficiency gains, United Airlines (UAL) may be well-positioned for a strong performance in the second half of the year.

Is United Airlines a Good Stock to Buy?

On Wall Street, UAL earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 14 Buy, one Hold, and zero Sell ratings in the past three months. Its average price target of $100.14 implies 33% upside potential over the next twelve months.

Thomas Wadewitz from UBS is particularly bullish on UAL, having upgraded the stock to Buy and raised its price target from $67 to $105. The analyst cited tariff relief following the 90-day agreement with China.

Moreover, “a more stable economic backdrop and the recent rebound in the U.S. equity market give it increased confidence in the resilience of international and premium revenue, which had been its primary cyclical concern for both Delta and United.”

Navigating Turbulence for Long-Term Gains

While United remains exposed to short-term oil price spikes due to its limited fuel hedging, it has several mitigating strategies in place. If fuel prices ease as expected, United stands to benefit meaningfully. With air travel demand on the rise and strong operational performance—reflected in above-average profit margins and record revenue—United appears well-positioned for further improvement.

That said, investors should closely watch oil price trends, particularly amid ongoing geopolitical uncertainty. Short-term volatility is likely, and those with lower risk tolerance may prefer airlines with more extensive hedging programs. Still, over the long run, strong fundamentals tend to win out. That’s why, despite potential turbulence ahead, I remain bullish on UAL.

“India targets 5 million metric tonnes (MMT) of green hydrogen production capacity by 2030.
There is significant potential to expand green hydrogen capacity to 10 MMT by 2035, if not earlier,” said Dr. Malhotra.
“The discovered cost of green hydrogen production in India is INR 397/kg, including 18% GST.

The agreement was signed by Dr. R.K. Malhotra, President of HAI, and Javier Brey Sánchez, President of AeH2, in the presence of Spanish Ambassador to India Juan Antonio March Pujol. Also present on the occasion was Sujit Pillai, Scientist-F, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE).

The MoU opens up opportunities for collaboration and joint ventures between stakeholders in both countries, aimed at accelerating R&D, production, deployment of green hydrogen technologies, and skilling of manpower as both nations pursue sustainable and affordable energy solutions.

“India targets 5 million metric tonnes (MMT) of green hydrogen production capacity by 2030. The current annual hydrogen demand stands at around 6–7 MMT and is expected to rise to 13 MMT by 2030. There is significant potential to expand green hydrogen capacity to 10 MMT by 2035, if not earlier,” said Dr. Malhotra.

However, cost remains a major challenge. “The discovered cost of green hydrogen production in India is INR 397/kg, including 18% GST. The base production cost is INR 336/kg, excluding storage, transportation, and delivery. If the price can be brought down to INR 250–300/kg, we believe demand across various sectors will rise,” he added.

Brey Sánchez emphasized the MoU’s potential to foster collaboration in developing more efficient electrolyzer technologies and scaling up their manufacturing to drive down costs. Spain, he noted, aims to meet 74% of its industrial hydrogen demand with green hydrogen by 2030 and targets 12 GW of installed electrolyzer capacity by then.

“To reduce the cost of green hydrogen, the partnership through the MoU will combine Spanish technology with Indian manufacturing,” said Brey Sánchez.

The leaders of Hull City Council and East Riding Council have warned that thousands of jobs in the renewable energy sector could be at risk – including hundreds locally – without urgent Government backing.

In a joint letter addressed to Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds and Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander, Councillor Mike Ross and Councillor Anne Handley have stressed the need for strong central Government support for Vivergo Fuels.

The future of the Vivergo plant, based at Saltend Chemicals Park, on the outskirts of Hull, is at imminent risk as a result of the recent UK-US trade deal.

In their letter, the council leaders have outlined the wider impact closure of Vivergo Fuels could have on the region, and how it also raises questions about the Government’s commitment to green energy and its policies to support it.

Cllr Ross said: “Not only is Vivergo Fuels the UK’s largest bioethanol producer, with a crucial role to play in UK transport decarbonisation, but it’s also a strategically important anchor employer in the region.

“It supports over 160 skilled jobs directly and around 4,000 more in the supply chain, the majority of which are based in our Hull and East Riding region.

“The Humber has gained a deserved reputation as a beacon for renewable energy development and production, and we are working extremely hard to attract further investment to the region in emerging technologies, such as hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel.

“This would be immeasurably harder to do if regulatory and financial support are not forthcoming for this business, which has already seen over £700m of private sector investment since 2012.

“The Government’s new UK-USA trade deal has deliberately moved the commercial goalposts, damaging a UK business which invests in the UK and employs UK workers, whilst advantaging American businesses who produce their product overseas.

“Allowing closure of the Vivergo Fuels plant would send a hugely damaging signal to clean energy investors and to any businesses who are considering investing in this region and across the UK.

“The Government has identified clean energy as one of its priority industries and states that its number one focus is encouraging growth, so we now need to see that rhetoric matched with concrete actions and support.

“On behalf of Hull City Council and East Riding of Yorkshire Council, I urge you to act swiftly to secure the necessary support for this business which is of great significance to the residents of our authority and many across our wider region.”

Ben Hackett, managing director of Vivergo Fuels, added: “Vivergo Fuels is a fantastic asset to Hull and East Yorkshire. Not only do we employ a highly skilled workforce and support thousands more jobs in the supply chain, we are a catalyst for further green industrial development and investment which would allow the fuels of the future to be pioneered right here on the Humber.

“We are simply asking the Government for measures that will allow UK ethanol producers to remain competitive in the face of US imports, which benefit from a range of advantages from genetically modified crops to cheaper energy costs.

“We now need to see concrete commitments from ministers in the coming days to safeguard jobs, and protect against the loss of significant investment in the people of this region.”",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5eb0828c5ab0a73ac072de78/5eb7de33257cac76592f068b/6855562f7bbf9150445e4ff0/1750423675493/P2+LEAD.+Vivergo+Fuels+at+Saltend+Chemicals+Park.jpg?format=1500w,N,,2025-06-20 13:08:47.381550

But away from the spotlight, China's commercial aircraft manufacturer COMAC made a quieter yet significant statement that warrants closer examination.

Although the company did not introduce any new aircraft or flight demonstrations, it showcased scale models of its three key projects: the regional C909, the narrow-body C919, and the wide-body C929, which is still in development.

These displays were modest compared to the elaborate presentations by Boeing and Airbus, but they highlighted COMAC's steady progress and long-term aspirations.

COMAC's strategy was pragmatic. The company signed memoranda of understanding with French aerospace group Safran and US-based Crane Aerospace, both related to the C929 program.

While the agreements lacked detailed information, they indicate that COMAC remains receptive to global partnerships, despite increasing US export restrictions on aviation technology.

The C909, formerly known as the ARJ21, is the company's most advanced product. Since its commercial debut in 2016, it has delivered 165 aircraft and is gradually becoming a reliable workhorse.

Lao Airlines and VietJet will operate the jet throughout Southeast Asia by 2025, joining Indonesia's TransNusa. These three carriers now fly 15 routes to 18 cities in the region.

The C909's advantages lie in its ability to perform well under challenging conditions. Its design is well-suited for short runways and high-temperature environments, allowing access to smaller airports – an important factor for emerging markets with limited infrastructure.

The C919, designed to accommodate 158 to 192 passengers, reflects China's ambition to penetrate the core market long dominated by Boeing and Airbus. It aims to compete with the Boeing 737 MAX and the Airbus A320neo.

So far, 20 aircraft have been delivered to Chinese airlines, with orders for over 1,000 planes placed.

Its fuel efficiency surpasses that of its peer models by 15 percent, and it can operate using up to 50 percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), aligning with growing environmental standards.

However, there are restrictions on plans for global expansion. Most overseas markets don't allow the C919 without FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) or EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency) certification.

Efforts are underway, however, with European safety authorities reviewing the aircraft. A decision may be delayed until 2028.

Still, COMAC's progress in Southeast Asia suggests another path. Vietnam is adapting to China's CAAC (Civil Aviation Administration of China) certification for the C909.

Such bilateral arrangements may offer a shortcut to market access in regions less bound by US or EU regulatory frameworks.

Another key challenge is engines. Both the C909 and C919 rely on Western engines – the GE CF34 and the CFM LEAP-1C.

The recent US restrictions on engine parts cast doubts on future supplies. COMAC is testing its domestic alternatives: the CJ-1000A for the C919 and the more powerful CJ-2000 for the future C929. These projects are not yet complete, but they represent a serious investment in long-term self-reliance.

How does the move affect global travelers and airlines?

First, more carriers may explore Chinese aircraft as alternatives to more expensive Western models. For passengers, that could mean lower fares and more direct connections between poorly connected cities.

Second, China's pursuit of green aviation – such as SAF-capable aircraft – aligns with broader industry goals. As airlines seek to meet carbon reduction targets, these capabilities will be increasingly valuable.

The path ahead is long. Market trust, certification, and production scale remain obstacles. But COMAC is not looking for overnight disruption.

Its approach seems more patient: establish a presence in surrounding markets, provide trustworthy service, and gradually expand globally.

The week that was

Leaders convened in Canada this week for G7 meetings. Climate was not a major focus, but governments agreed to boost global co-operation on wildfire mitigation, including through sustainable forest management and nature-based solutions. They also backed a Critical Minerals Action Plan aimed at ensuring resilient supply chains for “digital and energy secure economies”.

However, the summit was overshadowed by the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, which prompted an early departure by US President Donald Trump.

The rise of global oil prices on the back of the conflict is being used by some commentators to push the need for a renewables-based power system. Jess Ralston, analyst at UK-based think-tank the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said “energy independence will come from building out renewables, insulating homes and replacing gas boilers with electric heat pumps as well as moving to electric vehicles . . . we can’t afford to remain as vulnerable the next time oil and gas prices spike”.

Temperatures are also soaring, with the UK’s Met Office warning that people should try to get used to the hot weather. A study from the UK’s national weather and climate service shows the chance of temperatures hitting 40C is 20 times more likely than it was in the 1960s.

Person in the news

A common theme across all our stories this week is, whether we like it or not, President Trump.

While the world waits to see if he will, or not, bomb Iran, his domestic policies and long-arm lobbying are influencing what happens, or rather does not happen, in terms of climate action and the energy transition globally.

One area where Trump’s policies are having an impact is the global EV market. On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order to quash the target implemented by his predecessor Joe Biden of making 50 per cent of vehicles sold in the US electric by 2030, and froze $5bn in unspent federal funding reserved for building EV charging stations.

And he has not stopped there. He is now looking to withdraw a consumer tax credit of up to $7,500 for purchasing US-made EVs, introduced by Biden in 2021 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, and is proposing an $250 annual fee for EV owners.

Such changes could present a significant opportunity for the production of EVs in other markets, including the EU. But, European car manufacturers are also upping the pressure on the European Commission to scale back its climate ambitions.

Elsewhere, US-headquartered companies and industry associations have turned their lobbying attentions to the EU Methane Regulation, which imposes financial penalties on oil and gas companies whose imported fuels exceed methane intensity limits established by the EU.

Research by non-profit InfluenceMap shows American companies are trying to leverage the commission’s “omnibus” simplification package to weaken the rules.

This pushback comes as scientists have once again warned that the possibility of limiting warming as agreed under the Paris Agreement is increasingly unlikely.

Trump also came into office promising to bring peace, even suggesting himself as a Nobel Peace prize candidate. However, with governments everywhere increasing defence spending in the face of mounting uncertainty, it is hard to see how his interventions are making the world a safer place.

Europe

Representatives from more than 30 aviation companies have signed letters to EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra, national energy and transport ministers, and other senior EU officials calling for more funding for sustainable aviation fuel produced with renewable energy. The letter calls on national governments to commit funding jointly to an e-SAF pilot tender, using a double-sided auction mechanism, to kick-start the market and meet the demands of the EU’s SAF mandate, which requires EU flights to use an increasing volume of SAF in their fuel mix.

Global oil demand is still on track to peak before the end of the decade despite recent geopolitical disruptions, is the conclusion of the Paris-based International Energy Agency’s 2025 oil report. Growth in EVs and renewable energy are central to slowing demand, the report said. Meanwhile, the petrochemical industry is set to become the dominant source of oil demand growth from 2026 onwards. The industry is on track to consume one in every six barrels of oil by 2030, the report added.

Following on from its REPowerEU road map, the European Commission has put forward a legislative proposal to end its dependence on Russian oil and gas. Russian gas imports under new contracts will be prohibited as of January 1 2026. Existing short-term contracts will be stopped by June 17 2026, while contracts for landlocked countries and long-term deals will be allowed until the end of 2027. Russian oil imports are forecast to stop by the end of 2027. Member states will be required to present plans for the elimination of Russian oil and gas imports.

Meanwhile, the European Council has adopted its position on a draft vehicle recycling regulation that would require all vehicles to be designed with end-of-life recovery, reuse and recycling in mind. The proposal introduces targets for recycled plastic content in vehicles and opens the door for the commission to adopt targets for other recycled materials in the future.

The council has also agreed its position on the commission’s proposal to “stop the clock” on provisions of the EU Batteries Regulation, by delaying implementation of the rule’s due diligence requirements for two years.

Lawmakers in the European parliament and council have reached a provisional agreement on proposals to simplify the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. The institutions supported the commission’s proposal to exempt importers of less than 50 tonnes of carbon a year, saying it would ease the regulatory burden on individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises. The co-legislators also agreed on a number of technical amendments to the rules, including changes to its authorisation procedure and requirements regarding the collection and verification of emissions data. The agreement must now be formally endorsed by the two institutions, with adoption of the changes expected by September.

The Spanish government has published its first report into the cause of the blackout on the Iberian peninsula in late April. The outage was caused by surging voltages resulting in “a chain reaction of disconnections” shutting down the power network, the report stated. Both the grid operator and electricity companies were responsible, said Spanish energy and environment minister Sara Aagesen on Tuesday. She also defended the country’s commitment to increase renewable energy capacity, which some had wrongly speculated was the cause of the blackout.

Keeping with Spain, the EIB Group — made up of the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund — has signed a €250mn sustainable finance agreement with Santander to support the green transition of small Spanish businesses and mid-cap companies, and promote female entrepreneurship. The deal also allocates €50mn to strengthen the nation’s agricultural sector through investment in sustainable and regenerative agriculture, climate-resilient crops, water management and support for young and new farmers.

Elsewhere in Europe, Norway has announced the launch of its flagship full-scale industrial carbon capture and storage project, Longship. The launch follows the first shipment of carbon dioxide earlier this month from a plant owned by German cement giant Heidelberg Materials in Brevik, Norway, with offshore injection beneath the North Sea set to begin in August. The Norwegian Ministry of Energy also announced that it had approved plans to expand the project’s Northern Lights facility, a joint venture between oil companies Shell, Equinor and TotalEnergies. The expansion, which seeks to raise the project’s annual transport and storage capacity to at least 5mn tonnes from 1.5mn tonnes, is slated for completion in the second half of 2028.

The government has published guidance on environmental impact assessments for North Sea oil and gas drilling. The rules are in line with the 2024 Supreme Court “Finch” ruling that requires Scope 3 emissions from new oil and gas projects to be considered in assessments. Oil majors seeking to develop the Rosebank oilfield and Jackdaw gasfield can now reapply for licences. Tessa Khan, executive director of non-profit Uplift, said the guidance, published in response to a government consultation, means oil and gas companies “will finally be forced to come clean over the enormous harm they are causing to the climate”.

Environment secretary Steve Reed has said he is “stepping up” preparations for the potential temporary nationalisation of water company Thames Water. He will also reject demands from the company’s creditors for more leniency on environmental laws. Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, Reed said it is “only right” Thames Water is subject to the same consequences as any other water company. The government has also confirmed that more than £100mn in fines from polluting water companies will be reinvested in local environmental clean-up projects.

In other water news, the UK’s Environment Agency has warned England’s public water supply could be short by 5bn litres a day by 2055, a third of daily use, without urgent action. Climate change, population growth and environmental pressures are increasing water stress, said the agency. It has also published its five-yearly report the National Framework for Water Resources, which outlines what water companies, regulators, businesses and the public must do to best manage water usage into the future.

Meanwhile, the UK government has committed £7.9bn in funding for flood defences, in what it said is “the largest flooding programme in history”. The funding will be used for flood barriers and nature-based solutions such as wetland restoration. Every £1 spent on flood defences is expected to prevent around £8 in economic damage by the government.

The government has also announced a £500mn investment in regional hydrogen transport and storage infrastructure. The network is intended to connect hydrogen producers with end users such as power stations and industrial offtakers.

Publicly owned energy company Great British Energy, the Crown Estate and industry have joined the government in a £1bn public-private investment package in offshore wind supply chains. The £300mn from GBE, first announced in April, will be met with £400mn from the Crown Estate, and £300mn from the offshore wind industry. The funding will support turbine manufacturing facilities and associated infrastructure, including ports.

The UK is the leading EV market in Europe, shows BloombergNEF’s annual Electric Vehicle Outlook. In 2024, EVs made up 29 per cent of passenger vehicle sales in the UK, ahead of France (27 per cent) and Germany (13.9 per cent). EV uptake in the UK is accelerating faster than the global average and expected to hit 64 per cent of passenger vehicle sales by 2030, compared with 42 per cent globally, the report said. Globally, EV sales will reach almost 22mn, up 25 per cent from 2024, due to the falling cost of lithium-ion batteries and the availability of more affordable EV models, BloombergNEF said.

A group of 16 investors representing more than $795bn in assets under management has issued a public statement calling for high-emitting companies to take stronger action on air pollution. Co-ordinated by UK-based responsible investment non-profit ShareAction, the investor group warned that corporate air pollution is underestimated in financial risk assessments and corporate sustainability strategies, and presents a public health risk. Signatories include Achmea, Nest and Ethos Foundation.

The High Court of England and Wales has ruled a giant poultry farm due to be developed in Shropshire will have its planning permission revoked for failing to account for the environmental impact of industrial chicken farming, specifically the impact on rivers. The case was brought against Shropshire Council by a local campaigner, Alison Caffyn, who sits on the board of non-profit River Action. The judge ruled the planning authorities must assess the cumulative impacts of having multiple intensive agricultural developments in one river catchment and the management of waste from livestock production, including treatment facilities.

The long-delayed high-speed rail line HS2 has again been pushed back, with transport minister Heidi Alexander blaming “mismanagement” by the previous Conservative government. A new completion date for the project has not been given, but the government said it will be after 2033.

US

The Senate finance committee published its contribution to the “big, beautiful bill” on June 16, with additional cuts to Medicaid funding and eligibility, and slightly more flexible changes to green energy tax credits than those set out by the House. The text deletes a measure that would have required renewable energy projects to begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment to qualify for the credits, giving developers a year. It also introduces a more phased approach to their removal, and adds further carve-outs for hydropower, nuclear and geothermal projects.

A “subnational delegation” will take the place of the federal government at major international events including London Climate Action Week and the Paris Agreement anniversary. A joint announcement from groups including America Is All In and Climate Mayors said state and municipal leaders will fill the void left by the Trump administration. “Local leaders in the US have demonstrated their unique ability to move further and faster on climate progress,” said Climate Mayors executive director Kate Wright.

Oregon lawmakers have passed a bill directing the Oregon Investment Council and state treasurer to take further steps to address the risks climate change poses to workers’ retirement savings. The bill is the first of its kind in the US and follows similar bills in Oregon, New York and California to integrate sustainable investing principles into state pensions. The state will be required to report on and analyse emissions from public pension investment portfolios, reduce the fund’s carbon footprint, and report every other year on progress.

A federal judge has ruled the Trump administration’s move to terminate $600mn in environmental justice grants was illegal. The grants, issued under the Inflation Reduction Act, were provided to low-income communities. The judge said the Environmental Protection Agency exceeded its authority in cancelling the grants “precisely because they are ‘environmental justice’ programmes”, and that it lacked “reasoned decision-making”.

The US administration has said it will close climate.gov, the gateway website for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s climate programme office. For 15 years it has been a resource of public information about climate change. In June, nearly all of its staff were fired and those remaining were told the website will not publish new content.

Legislators failed to get New York state’s proposed climate disclosure bill through the Senate before the legislative calendar closed for the year. Senate bill S3456 was debated, but the session ended without agreement. Business groups had written to governor Kathy Hochul, claiming the rules would have expectations of businesses that many “lack the resources or technical capacity to do”. The bill is expected to be reintroduced in the next session — in January 2026 — which would push back compliance by another year.

Africa

UK-based clean energy company Octopus Energy has launched the Octopus Energy Power Africa Fund, which will initially invest in rooftop solar and battery storage in sub-Saharan Africa. The fund is starting with an initial $60mn and seeks to mobilise $250mn over the next three years. Africa’s energy market is one of the fastest-growing globally, driven by an unmatched abundance of sunshine and wind, said Octopus.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/c56ebd12-47fc-4e81-afd7-72bfcb92d341.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 09:05:48.966927

Poland wraps up CBAM changes with European Parliament

Brussels, 18 June (Argus) — Poland has concluded negotiations on behalf of EU member states with the European Parliament for a revised carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), ahead of handing over the bloc's six-month rotating presidency to Denmark at the end of June. But Warsaw will not lead discussions on the EU's emissions cut target for 2040 and the bloc's updated nationally determined contribution (NDC) to the Paris climate agreement. Leading negotiations for EU states with parliament, Poland's deputy climate minister Krzysztof Bolesta said the revised CBAM would exempt 90pc of originally covered EU companies from reporting obligations, while 99pc of emissions embedded in imported products would remain covered. The agreement on CBAM now has to be formally approved by parliament and EU ministers. Once published in the bloc's official journal, the revised CBAM text will exempt importers that do not exceed a new single mass-based threshold of 50 t/yr of imported goods. Bolesta admitted that progress has been held up on concluding the EU's NDC during Warsaw's presidency of EU ministerial meetings. CBAM was also listed by Bolesta as one of the points for flexibility in discussions on the 2040 climate target, alongside carbon credits under Article 6 of the Paris agreement, additional funding and flexibility between climate sub-targets. At a meeting of environment ministers yesterday, Bolesta indicated that most states still favour the European Commission linking its submission of an EU NDC to the UN — which includes a 2035 emissions cut target — with the bloc's planned 2 July proposal for a 2040 EU climate target. The CBAM yesterday contributed to delays in technical negotiations held in Bonn, Germany, for the UN Cop 30 climate conference in Brazil. The Like-Minded Group of Developing Countries, including countries such as Bolivia, China, Saudi Arabia, Cuba and Vietnam, had urged the need to address concerns ""with climate change-related trade-restrictive unilateral measures"". Despite ""very, very divergent views"", EU member states agree that it ""is absolutely urgent to come up with an NDC before the end of September"", Bolesta said. The Polish presidency of the EU, chairing climate ministers' meetings, has advanced NDC work as much as possible in the absence of the commission's proposal to revise the bloc's climate law. ""We really have only a couple of months to come up with something. What lacks in the NDC draft is now the headline target,"" Bolesta said. Countries have not yet discussed the quality of Article 6 offsets, Bolesta added. ""Everyone in the room realises that we need to be very stringent on what kind of offset will be let into the system,"" he said. EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra is ""cautiously optimistic"" that a landing ground can be found on the 2040 climate target. He called for more assertive climate diplomacy, as a large part of the problem lies outside Europe. For China, Hoekstra noted unfair trade practices and ""serious"" concerns about plans to build additional coal-fired plants. ""It's a mixed bag. And we invite them to step up their ambition,"" he said. By Dafydd ab Iago Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025. Argus Media group .

Data centre power grab worries H2 sector

Data centres are locking in deals with suppliers, as H2 projects struggle to get off the ground, writes Stefan Krumpelmann Hamburg, 17 June (Argus) — The global hydrogen sector is not short of problems that are keeping it from lift-off. To that list can now be added a surge in competition from data centres for clean power, key equipment and engineering services. For some technology providers in the hydrogen sector, the big data boom presents opportunities. Fuel cell manufacturers say they are seeing interest in back-up power from data centre operators, for example. But there is growing consensus that data centres will outcompete hydrogen projects for key resources. Power — especially from renewables or nuclear — is the most obvious area of competition. While hydrogen projects struggle to get off the ground for a multitude of reasons, data centres are gobbling up large amounts of power under long-term contracts. Over the past month alone, US technology giant Meta has signed deals for 650MW of solar power in Texas and Kansas from utility AES and 1.1GW of nuclear power from utility Constellation, while entering a co-operation agreement with Houston-based XGS Energy to develop a 150MW geothermal project. Rising power demand and prices have held back numerous US electrolysis projects, electrolyser and fuel cell maker Bloom Energy's executive vice-president and chief commercial officer, Aman Joshi, said last year — before the US hydrogen sector was rocked by President Donald Trump's return to the White House. Such competition is increasingly evident elsewhere too, including in Latin American countries with high hopes for hydrogen, but where progress has been sluggish. ""If hydrogen doesn't take the renewable power from LatAm, data centres and crypto will,"" Inter-American Development Bank's lead energy specialist, Christiaan Gischler, said at last month's World Hydrogen Summit in Rotterdam. Electricity prices for renewable hydrogen projects that are planning to draw on grid power have shot up because data centres will pay more, Australian developer InterContinental Energy's chief executive, Alexander Tancock, says. Global data centre power consumption could more than double to 945 TWh/yr by 2030 from about 415 TWh/yr as artificial intelligence use grows rapidly, Paris-based energy watchdog the IEA said in April. Much of this rise would be driven by the US, where data centre demand could eclipse the power consumption of all energy-intensive industries combined by the end of this decade, the IEA forecasts. Big data's growth could make it harder to secure key equipment too. Lead times for key items have already lengthened as equipment is reserved for data centre installations, engineering, procurement and construction firm Black & Veatch's senior vice-president and managing director for Europe, Middle East and Africa, Youssef Merjaneh says. Major manufacturers' order books are full until 2028 for equipment such as switchgears, transformers and gas turbines, he says. Developers are feeling the pinch. Transformer lead times have risen to three years from two, France-headquartered Lhyfe's manager for the Benelux region, Adriaan van Hoeken, says. A skilled worker shortage could be another hurdle. Only a fraction of announced hydrogen projects will be built, at least in the near term, which could alleviate previous concerns about staffing bottlenecks. But the workers might instead be needed elsewhere, such as in data centre development. Merjaneh estimates that 35-40GW of data centre additions are planned until 2030, while existing engineering capacity would only support 10-15GW.

Q&A: Suburban's renewable quest continues

London, 17 June (Argus) — US LPG distributor Suburban Propane was the first company to sell a propane-renewable DME (rDME) blend in California in 2022 . The company has also pioneered sales of biopropane in the US and has since expanded into renewable natural gas (RNG) — also called biomethane — and hydrogen. Argus spoke with Suburban's vice-president of renewable energy, Douglas Dagan, about the push into renewables and the challenges ahead: Could you provide an update on Suburban's renewable DME sales? We continue to have a strategic partnership with Oberon Fuels , which produces rDME in the US. We are the only commercial seller of a propane-rDME blend — right now we sell to all of our forklift truck and autogas customers from our Anaheim, California, location. The product is a true drop-in replacement that can be used in all propane applications. The blend ratio is currently small, but we are testing higher percentages to determine the maximum drop-in blend level. We received an exemption from the California Air Resources Board [CARB] to run a pilot testing higher blend levels in vehicles. What is the current blend ratio and what is the maximum you are looking at? Our commercial blend is 4pc rDME. This ensures no issues as a drop-in replacement. We want to get to a 10pc maximum, but we've done a lot of testing and are delivering at 4pc in the Anaheim market. We are confident there are no issues on the customer side when a 4pc blend is used in an engine. Now we're looking to assess higher blend percentages. Getting CARB pilot approval was the first step. Why has the maximum fallen from previous estimates of 20pc and then 12pc? RDME has a lot of potential, but it's more challenging than anticipated. We started testing before the World Liquid Gas Association [WLGA] did. The belief was you could blend up to 20pc and everything would work. It turns out it's more like 10pc — lower than hoped — which means environmental benefits don't scale as fast. You have to ensure no issues arise from the oxygen content in DME, such as seal degradation causing leaks. There must be a high degree of confidence. On the supply side, different blend ratios require dedicated tanks and infrastructure — you can't switch between 4pc and 20pc easily — so it's very costly to have more than one blend. What are the latest in terms of your renewable propane sales? We are rapidly scaling — we've sold over 1mn USG [1,900t] of renewable propane in California, where we primarily offer renewable propane. Several programmes support renewable propane, but California credits are the most lucrative. We will sell outside California and are exploring expansion. The biggest challenge is availability. Many producers don't yet see value in separating renewable propane from the stream — it's a by-product, from renewable diesel or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production. We're building relationships to say: we have demand, and we'll pay. We just need more of it. How does Donald Trump's presidency and the resulting pressures on the regulatory environment for the energy transition affect Suburban's renewable plans? I think the Trump administration is supportive of what we're doing. It has different priorities from the Biden administration, but we still see support at both state and federal levels for our traditional product. On the renewable side, we're developing drop-in renewable propane, as well as RNG and clean hydrogen. There's support for all three. A Trump priority is domestic industry, and our plans are heavily domestic. Every administration brings new challenges. Lack of certainty is the biggest — knowing future policies is hard. Luckily we have a traditional product and a renewable platform that have support from both parties and we think the outlook for the future is good regardless of which party is in control. Can you explain why the carbon intensity (CI) metric could be an important tool for policy makers? It's a critical metric, though a bit technical. Policy makers deal with many issues — energy is just one. But the more people understand CI, the better the decisions. The CI scale, developed by Argonne National Lab, is a full life-cycle emissions calculation, covering production and use. Electric vehicles [EVs] are often seen as cleanest, but not always. CI reveals this — the lower the better. For example, if the electricity grid is dirtier than gasoline, switching to EVs worsens emissions. In most US states, the grid is dirtier than traditional propane. Gasoline and diesel score about 100, traditional propane around 80, and renewable propane 20-40. Suburban is moving into hydrogen and RNG. Is this a diversification strategy or do they somehow complement the core LPG business? We have a large RNG facility in Arizona using dairy manure and co-feed from organic waste. We can produce 1,000–1,500mn Btu/d of RNG sent via pipeline to California for engine fuel. Its CI score is a little better than minus 350 — phenomenally clean. We're building a new facility in upstate New York, and upgrading one in Columbus, Ohio, that uses food and organic waste. We're also evaluating other RNG opportunities. But we're also growing our LPG business. RNG is a great product — and part of a strategic platform. Digesters make biogas, which becomes RNG. But raw biogas can also be used to make rDME and renewable propane. And RNG can make clean hydrogen — or rDME/renewable propane that can be transported and reformed into clean hydrogen on site. These are all interconnected. Will the company retain its core focus as a propane supplier? Yes. Propane is a unique energy source that will remain critical. Many customers are in areas where large-scale grid decarbonisation isn't feasible, so propane as distributed energy is vital. [And] more extreme weather events take down grids. Propane is resilient — useful for heating, cooking and generating electrons to power EVs where the grid can't meet demand. If emergency EVs run on electricity and the grid fails, you need another way to generate electrons. [So, propane has a lasting role.] Have Suburban's traditional propane sales been pressured by warmer winters? Winter 2024–25 was much colder than the record-warm winter a year earlier, which had lowered demand. This winter, heating demand climbed and sales increased. But our strategy doesn't rely on cold weather. We're growing non-weather-related demand via traditional and renewable platforms — especially for engines and back-up power. Our goal is to grow both platforms and deploy capital for the greatest returns. What are your hopes for the rest of this year for the renewables business? We plan to keep growing RNG production. Output is rising at our Stanfield [Arizona] facility and the other two mentioned. We're also exploring hydrogen opportunities and expect that segment to grow. For renewable propane and DME, we've seen tremendous recent growth — especially in renewable propane. We're pursuing more supply and new markets outside California. Reaching 1mn USG in sales was a big milestone — and we want to keep building on that this year. Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025.

The aviation industry’s push toward net-zero emissions by 2050 has placed Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) at the center of its decarbonization efforts. While feedstock availability remains a critical challenge, Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) or biomethane is emerging as a promising feedstock.

RNG, a pipeline-quality biogas, offers the potential to scale SAF production by utilizing established gas-to-liquid (GTL) technologies, such as SynCOR™ autothermal reforming and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis. This approach combines proven processes with innovative adaptations, creating a high-carbon-efficiency pathway for SAF production. With demand for SAF growing globally and new mandates driving its adoption, RNG could unlock a more sustainable, scalable future for aviation.

Introducing RNG and its potential as a SAF feedstock

RNG (or biomethane) is a purified form of biogas derived from organic waste sources such as agricultural residue, food waste, or wastewater treatment. Upgraded to meet the quality standards of fossil natural gas, RNG is pipeline-compatible and can be used as a direct substitute for traditional natural gas. RNG has great potential to serve as a renewable feedstock for producing SAF due to its renewable origin and compatibility with existing infrastructure.

RNG can either be used locally on-site, primarily as a fuel or for power generation, or injected into natural gas distribution pipelines for broader regional export. For SAF production, pipeline distribution is the more practical option. It enables access to sufficient RNG volumes to supply large-scale production facilities, where economies of scale become viable for output exceeding 2,000 barrels per day of liquid fuels.

RNG can help meet demand

The potential for increased RNG production is significant in both the U.S. and Europe. According to the ICF – American Gas Foundation (2019), the U.S. could produce between 1,500 and 6,500 trillion Btu of RNG annually by 2040. In Europe, the European Commission aims to boost production from 3 billion cubic meters in 2022 to 35 billion cubic meters by 2030.

Meanwhile, SAF demand is expected to grow steadily to meet aviation’s net-zero carbon emissions commitments by 2050. SAF mandates are advancing in the EU and UK, and earlier this year, the U.S. introduced federal blenders tax credit guidance. Other countries, including Japan, Singapore, India, Brazil, Indonesia, and Malaysia, are also making strides to drive domestic SAF adoption. In short, RNG has the potential to play a critical role in supporting SAF production targets, enabling the scale-up needed to meet these ambitious goals.

Alternatives for SAF production from RNG

RNG is a biological feedstock with properties equivalent to fossil-based natural gas, so the first step in leveraging RNG for SAF production involves examining technologies previously used to convert natural gas into liquid fuels (GTL).

The Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process has been the primary technology used in GTL plants at a commercial scale. Two key GTL technology routes have been successfully deployed. Thes first is the integrated Sasol’s GTL technology, as applied among others in Oryx GTL Qatar and Uzbekistan GTL. This uses Topsoe’s low steam-to-carbon SynCOR™ autothermal reforming to convert natural gas and oxygen into syngas, followed by Sasol’s LTFT™ low-temperature FT process in the slurry reactor technology to produce synthetic hydrocarbons like diesel and kerosene (jet fuel).

The second is Shell’s GTL technology, as applied in Pearl GTL Qatar, which converts natural gas and oxygen into syngas through partial oxidation, steam methane reforming, and fixed-bed FT reactors with cobalt-based catalysts.

Current alternatives for SAF production from RNG could be grouped in two main routes. Fischer-Tropsch based process producing jet-fuel as per D7566 A1 and syngas to ethanol to jet based process producing jet-fuel as per D7566 A5.

Approaches

From previous experience, autothermal reforming, such as SynCOR™, is considered among the best technologies for gas-to-liquid (GTL) processes. Operating at a low steam-to-carbon ratio, it produces syngas with the optimal H₂/CO ratio for FT synthesis and supports large-scale single train capacities.

GTL plants have traditionally been developed to operate in remote locations in island mode while maximizing plant capacity. Considerations applied in the gas-to-liquid plants are not necessarily all applicable in an RNG based concept, where reduction of carbon emission and maximizing carbon efficiency is a key aspect of the design. By improving process efficiency and using renewable energy along with reducing carbon-rich off-gases for heating and utility needs, RNG concepts can achieve these goals.

Case study provides proof point

In a recent case study, several process adaptations were implemented to maximize the carbon efficiency of the fuels plant. These types of RNG based facilities are conceptualized at lower capacities and more integrated in existing power and utility networks. This eliminates the need for an island design approach.

A key step change is the ability to utilize carbon-rich off-gases within the fuels production process, which boosts carbon efficiency and reduces the overall carbon intensity of the fuel system.

The SynCOR™ design replicates the layout of a traditional GTL plant while incorporating necessary adjustments by modifying the unit’s operating conditions. As a result, the core design and equipment of an RNG-based fuels plant closely resemble those of a fossil-based GTL plant.

GTL process adaptation

To maximize the utilization of carbon-rich off-gases within the process, the operating steam-to-carbon ratio of the SynCOR™ unit is adjusted to produce syngas with a hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide ratio of 2.0 – adequate for FT processes. Additional external hydrogen could further enhance carbon utilization within the process.

Superheated steam requirements are minimized and generated solely within the fuels unit. All requirements for process steam and preheating purposes are met with saturated steam produced within the unit. This eliminates the requirement for external steam superheaters, thereby reducing demand for carbon-based fuels.

The process also includes the option to recycle carbon-containing streams, such as light-end and naphtha fractions from the upgrading section. Naphtha can be reprocessed in the SynCOR™ unit, boosting syngas production for SAF. Naphtha pre-reforming and reforming are well-established steps for several decades, making them an excellent choice for maximizing SAF output.

It includes production tax credits meant to incentivize the deployment of low-carbon hydrogen.

“But I believe green hydrogen has a strong future and is going to be big. India will play an instrumental role in this transition, alongside many other countries devoted to this,” he added.

The MNRE Secretary said India is in discussions with Europe, specifically the ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp, to ensure that green hydrogen and its derivatives exported to these countries are transported smoothly. Reduction of import duties on India’s green hydrogen exports is also a part of ongoing free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations with Europe, he said.

Sluggish offtake slows expansion of green hydrogen sector

ReNew, a major renewables player in India, is developing a green ammonia project in Odisha. However, weak export demand remains a major hurdle for offtake.

“At this point, export markets are very weak, with little movement globally. That said, there is some progress on the shipping front, with the International Maritime Organization urging shipping companies to start using some degree of clean fuels, about 5 per cent. Sustainable aviation fuel may also take off soon. So there is hope for the future — but for now, progress remains slow,” its chief executive officer Sumant Sinha told The Indian Express.

On demand from the EU, Sinha said, “The issue is that the EU and its companies aren’t floating major tenders. The lone Hintco tender failed due to poor design from a developer’s perspective, drawing almost no bids. Since then, nothing significant has emerged, and with ongoing geopolitical stuff, attention has shifted elsewhere.”

Hintco is the implementing agency of the Hamburg-headquartered H2Global Foundation, which was set up to support the large-scale ramp-up and industrial use of clean hydrogen and other low-emissions fuels.

Building domestic demand in focus

With export demand still weak, the government is focused on building domestic demand. “We’ve seen strong interest in green hydrogen — our tender for around 8 lakh tonnes was fully bid out. Similarly, for offtake arrangements, we’re working with the Ministry of Fertilizers and the fertilizer industry. SECI (Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd) is currently conducting a tender for about 7 lakh tonnes to support this,” Sarangi said.

“As far as the Government of India is concerned, several measures are underway to ensure offtake. Pilot projects are also being implemented across sectors like transportation, shipping, and steel. We’re currently funding hydrogen fuel cell buses in five locations, including Ladakh, to test their viability in real-world conditions,” he added.

Sinha argued that domestic mandates may be necessary to replace grey hydrogen — produced from fossil fuels — with green hydrogen. For instance, the fertiliser industry could be required to source more green ammonia from domestic producers.

Green hydrogen, produced by powering electrolysers with renewable energy, is a key feedstock for green ammonia, made by combining hydrogen with nitrogen. Green ammonia has applications as a low-carbon fertiliser and as a fuel for shipping.

Green hydrogen not yet cost competitive

“Commercially, it’s not viable yet because green hydrogen is still more expensive than grey hydrogen. So, no one is going to buy it voluntarily. It’s similar to where renewable energy was 15 years ago — back then, it wasn’t commercially viable either. Today, it is. Green hydrogen is at that early stage now,” Sinha said.

A new report by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Bain & Company, and RMI released on Thursday said, “The slowed momentum primarily stems from the current high production costs along with nascent enabling infrastructure and high financing costs. Current production costs — $4-$5 per kg of green hydrogen vs. $2.3-$2.5 per kg of grey hydrogen typically (some industries may procure at higher costs) — are not yet competitive.”

In 2023, the Central government launched the National Green Hydrogen Mission, setting a target of 5 million metric tonnes (MMT) of green hydrogen production capacity by 2030, backed by an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore. Under the mission, the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) programme aims to support both green hydrogen production and electrolyser manufacturing.

In April, MNRE also launched a scheme to measure, monitor, report, verify on-site, and certify green hydrogen based on a standard introduced by the ministry in 2023.

The CII report outlines five immediate demand-side strategies to accelerate green hydrogen adoption. It recommends blending small amounts of green hydrogen into existing grey hydrogen or piped natural gas supplies for high-volume sectors such as refineries, fertilisers, and city gas networks, while factoring in technical feasibility. It suggests encouraging substitution in niche industries such as glass, ceramics, and chemicals where switching is cost-neutral. Public procurement, especially for green steel, can also help scale domestic demand.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/06/Santosh-Kumar-Sarangi-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 11:06:09.572554

Speaking at the 35th Annual Congress & General Assembly of ACI Europe in Athens, Tzitzikostas highlighted that despite Europe’s leadership in air traffic management innovation, current airspace capacity is insufficient to meet demand, especially during peak travel seasons. This congestion has resulted in overcrowded airports, delayed flights, and frustrated travelers.

“Europe is a world leader in innovation in air traffic management, but we need another push to make European skies more flexible and less fragmented,” he said.

The Commissioner emphasized the potential of SESAR (Single European Sky ATM Research) innovations to improve efficiency and urged immediate investment in new technologies and recruitment of additional staff to enhance airspace management and reduce delays.

Sustainability: A central pillar for Europe’s airports

During his speech, Tzitzikostas applauded airports’ proactive role in carbon management, notably through initiatives like the Airport Carbon Accreditation programme. He highlighted how airports are evolving into clean energy hubs by integrating green electricity systems, hydrogen, and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), positioning themselves as testbeds for the circular economy and new market opportunities.

He described reducing carbon emissions as critical not only for environmental reasons but also as a driver of economic growth, energy independence, and social progress. The European Union will continue supporting this transition through incentives and policies to accelerate renewable fuels, greener infrastructure, and clean technologies in both aircraft and airport operations.

Looking ahead, Tzitzikostas said the EU’s upcoming Sustainable Transport Investment Plan aims to bolster support for renewable aviation fuels and green technologies. He underscored the importance of rewarding “courage and risk-taking” to turn the “first mover disadvantage” into a competitive edge for airports embracing sustainability.

Enhancing competitiveness and resilience

Referring to competitiveness, Tzitzikostas said it remains a key priority. The Commissioner noted ongoing revisions to air service regulations intended to strengthen Europe’s international aviation competitiveness, reduce bureaucratic hurdles, and enhance passenger rights. A comprehensive legislative proposal is expected by mid-2026.

He also highlighted the importance of improving sector resilience and crisis management. Acknowledging the challenges posed by climate change and security threats, Tzitzikostas called for climate risk assessments in airport infrastructure planning and construction. He praised ACI members for leveraging technology to improve passenger experience and safety, pledging continued EU support for innovation and collaboration.

The vital role of airports in Europe’s connectivity

Reaffirming the crucial role of airports, the Commissioner stressed their importance in connecting European communities and economies. He highlighted the need for ongoing cooperation among stakeholders to maintain Europe’s leadership in innovation, sustainability, and operational excellence.

Airbus has committed to purchasing SAF options for its employees' business travel by joining Air France-KLM's ""SAF Corporate"" program for the third consecutive year, a program that facilitates the funding and purchase of SAF.

Since the beginning of 2025, Air France-KLM has offered Airbus employees the opportunity to finance a percentage of SAF during the booking process on a selection of routes frequently used by the Group, such as Toulouse-Paris and Toulouse-Montreal, where Airbus has a production facility. This option, visible at the time of booking, aims to raise individual awareness among employees about efforts to reduce CO2 emissions related to business travel.

Since joining the SAF program in November 2023, Airbus has reduced its CO2 emissions by more than 2,000 tons through the purchase of over 670 tons of SAF. This approach offers employees a concrete opportunity to reduce the carbon footprint of their business travel.

Sébastien Guyot, Executive Vice President Global Sales at Air France-KLM, stated: ""Reducing our CO2 emissions is a priority for our Group. Sustainable aviation fuel is essential to achieving our ambitions, and the contribution of our corporate customers, like Airbus, is crucial.""

Raphaël Duflos, Vice President Corporate Services Procurement at Airbus, added: ""We are proud to be pioneers in adopting the new 'SAF Bundle' offer following the rollout of the New Distribution Capability (NDC) with Air France. This demonstrates the importance of our strategic partnership with Air France on this key topic of decarbonizing business travel-a collaboration that has been evolving and expanding since 2023.""",https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png,N,,2025-06-20 11:06:16.377523

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is facing mounting backlash after announcing plans to phase out the Energy Star programme, a 30-year-old initiative widely praised for advancing energy efficiency.

First launched in 1992, Energy Star labels have helped consumers identify high-efficiency products and buildings, playing a crucial role in reducing emissions and energy costs.

Critics, including 22 US senators, argue the EPA’s move may breach federal law, which mandates joint oversight of the programme with the Department of Energy under the Energy Policy Act of 2005.

Environmental advocates warn that ending Energy Star would undermine climate goals, particularly as EVs increase demand on the grid and require efficient surrounding infrastructure.

""Every dollar spent on the Energy Star programme has resulted in nearly US$350 in energy cost savings for businesses and households,"" comments Senator Ruben Gallego, highlighting the programme’s proven value.

Given the intricacies of the refining process and the natural variation in raw materials, it is challenging to define an exact chemical composition for fuels. As a result, the Classification, Labelling, and Packaging (CLP) Regulation gives some flexibility when notifying fuels, compared to other mixtures.

Why are fuels reported differently?

Unlike more straightforward chemical formulations, fuels are derived from crude oil, which undergoes refining processes that can lead to variations in composition. This makes it difficult to provide a definitive list of ingredients in the way that is typically required for a standard PCN submission.

Recognising this complexity, the CLP Regulation allows the composition from the fuel’s Safety Data Sheet (SDS) to be used instead of the full composition. Additionally, the identity and concentration of any other known components shall also be included in the submission.

Key considerations for fuels in PCNs

Scope of PCN requirements: fuels fall under the remit of PCN obligations meaning companies dealing with these substances must submit notifications in compliance with CLP Regulation Annex VIII requirements.

UFI and reporting challenges: each submitted fuel must have an associated Unique Formula Identifier (UFI) so that in a poisoning emergency, health care professionals and emergency responders can ensure an accurate match between the fuel and its composition.

List of fuels: The following table outlines the fuels that benefit from the regulatory flexibility provided by the CLP Regulation. Products can only notify as a “fuel” if included on this list, otherwise products would be treated as a standard mixture under CLP, meaning we need full composition.

Please note that this list is exhaustive according to the CLP guidelines, available here:

Sustainability support

Beyond Poison Centre compliance, fuel producers are increasingly affected by EU-wide sustainability regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting the use of renewable energy in transport. Key pieces of legislation – including RED II, RefuelEU Aviation, and FuelEU Maritime – play a central role in shaping the future of fuel production and use. These frameworks introduce new targets and sustainability criteria that fuel manufacturers must consider as part of their operational and strategic planning:

REDII (Renewable Energy Directive II):

Establishes a fossil fuel baseline of 94gCO2eq per MJ.

Requires a 70% reduction in emissions for Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBOs).

Refuel EU Aviation (Aviation Fuels):

Mandates a gradual increase in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blending into conventional aviation fuel (2% by 2025, 6% by 2030, 70% by 2050).

SAF must achieve at least a 65% reduction in emissions to qualify.

FuelEU Marine (Marine Fuels):

Sets Greenhouse Gas (GHG) intensity limits for marine fuels' well-to-wake emissions (34.6gCO2eq per MJ by 2045 and 18.2gCO2eq per MJ by 2050).

Introduces a specific calculation methodology to assess emissions.

The initiative delivers an integrated, end-to-end solution that converts biomass and municipal solid waste into SAF by bringing together a full range of technologies under one delivery model.

It combines GIDARA Energy’s gasification systems, Johnson Matthey’s catalyst expertise, Honeywell’s automation and process controls, and SAMSUNG E&A’s global engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) capabilities.

At the core of the solution is the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process, a well-established method for producing liquid hydrocarbons from synthesis gas.

The companies say this approach not only simplifies project development but also reduces risk, offering one point of accountability from initial feasibility to full-scale execution. According to the alliance, the model can shorten lead times by more than 15% and reduce capital expenditure by up to 10%.

Aviation’s pressure to scale up

The initiative comes at a time when aviation is under growing pressure to scale up sustainable fuel use, but faces limited access to traditional feedstocks such as used cooking oil or animal fats.

By enabling SAF production from household and industrial waste streams, the alliance aims to unlock new supply chains for the sector.

Ken West, President and CEO of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, said, “As demand for SAF increases, the technology to expand available feedstock options becomes increasingly vital. This comprehensive alliance provides refiners with a strategic approach to quickly execute their vision.”

Clearing the path to SAF growth

The International Energy Agency predicts that waste- and residue-based sources will account for more than 40% of total biofuel demand by 2030, reinforcing the urgency of technology solutions that can tap into these resources.

“The alliance targets the common challenges faced by SAF producers and offers a new way forward with greater speed and lower capital expense cost,” said Maurits van Tol, CEO of Catalyst Technologies, Johnson Matthey.

The global SAF market was valued at $658.18 million in 2023, and will be worth $15.85 billion by the end of the decade, the report claims, driven by increasing environmental awareness, strong regulatory backing, and growing demand across both the commercial and military aviation sectors.

SAF adoption

International climate targets, such as the Paris Agreement and ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) initiative, have put pressure on the aviation sector to decarbonise, and adoption of SAF is ‘speeding up’ thanks to government mandates and incentives such as tax credits. This, in turn is leading to increased interest from the corporate sector.

‘The increasing investor attention on eco-friendly aviation technologies together with rising R&D funding creates innovative business structures and collaborative partnerships,’ the report notes. ‘SAF emerges as a crucial element for sustainable aviation because the public’s increased environmental consciousness and eco-conscious travel trends strengthen the need for cleaner aviation solutions.’

Emissions reduction

Currently, the aviation sector is responsible for between 2% and 3% of global CO2 emissions. As well as government action to address this, a number of airlines, including Delta, Lufthansa, British Airways, and United Airlines, are responding by committing to net-zero goals by 2050 and entering long-term procurement agreements for SAF.

‘These companies are forging extended offtake agreements with SAF producers while simultaneously co-investing in production facilities and investigating partnerships with technology firms to ensure a continuous supply of low-carbon fuels,’ the report notes.

Airline manufacturers, too, are doing their part, with commitments to certify commercial aircraft for full SAF operation by 2030.

‘Airlines with strong environmental credentials are becoming preferred choices for corporate travellers and logistics providers, which pushes carriers to adopt SAF in their operations,’ the report states. ‘Industry-led initiatives demonstrate the increasing agreement that SAF adoption serves as both an environmental necessity and a competitive edge.’

The aviation sector urgently requires large volumes of drop-in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to meet decarbonization targets. Advanced biofuels derived from lignocellulosic residues, particularly via syngas-to Fischer-Tropsch Biomass-to-Liquid (BtL) processes, are among the most promising options. However, conventional BtL remains cost-intensive, and its economic viability is uncertain. Electrification of BtL through the integration of electrolytic hydrogen, co-electrolysis, or plasma-assisted gasification has been proposed as a means to boost carbon efficiency and product yield. This study investigates whether such electrification strategies can be economically viable. A detailed techno-economic assessment (TEA) is conducted for the conventional BtL process and eight electrified alternatives. The TEA is based on thermodynamic process models implemented in Aspen ­Plus and the different process configurations are compared in terms of capital investment and levelized cost of SAF production. The results reveal a trade-off between carbon efficiency and production cost. Under baseline assumptions, electrification increases both capital investment and production cost. Sensitivity analyses identify electricity and biomass prices, SOEL stack costs, and plant operating hours as key cost drivers. Under favorable assumptions, certain configurations offer improved capital efficiency and competitive production costs at the same time. Several electrified configurations achieve LCOPs below 1.5 €/l suggesting that while electrification does not universally reduce costs, it can enable economically viable SAF production under the right conditions particularly when high product yields and carbon efficiency are prioritized.",https://cdn.ssrn.com/ssrn-global-header/11589acb53bc518aa22929bf19add113.svg,N,,2025-06-20 04:00:05.828531

“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to 2 million tonnes in 2025 that is just 0.7% of aviation’s total fuel needs.

“And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion (€3.8 billion) globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

Most SAF is now heading toward Europe, where the EU and UK mandates kicked in on 1 January 2025.

Unacceptably, the cost of SAF to airlines has now doubled in Europe because of compliance fees that SAF producers or suppliers are charging.

For the expected one million tonnes of SAF that will be purchased to meet the European mandates in 2025, the expected cost at current market prices is $1.2 billion (€1.04 billion).

Compliance fees are estimated to add an additional $1.7 billion (€1.47 billion) on top of market prices — an amount that could have abated an additional 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions.

Instead of promoting the use of SAF, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel.

“This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonisation. Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7 trillion (€4.07 trillion) should not be the aim or the result of decarbonisation policies. Europe needs to realise that its approach is not working and find another way,” said Walsh.",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Policy-shortcomings-pic-Biofuel-20-6-130777505-768x512.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 08:04:25.899008

TotalEnergies is working towards the decarbonization of air transportation, with the production and distribution to its customers of sustainable aviation fuel . As from 2028, the Company will be able to produce more than half a million tons of SAF a year to cover the increase in the European SAF blending mandate, set at 6% for 2030.

TotalEnergies will be able to supply SAF more than 10% of the jet fuel volumes it will market in Europe, ahead of the European mandate set at 6% in 2030.

“TotalEnergies is taking action to meet the strong demand from the aviation industry to reduce its carbon footprint. Sustainable aviation fuels are essential to bring the air industry’s CO2 emissions down immediately. Their development is fully aligned with our approach to get to net zero, together with society,” said Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TotalEnergies. “For ten years, we have been pioneering and investing in biorefineries and developing coprocessing in our refineries.”

TotalEnergies, pioneering SAF production

The Grandpuits biorefinery: Thanks to a €500 million investment, TotalEnergies transforms its site into a zero-crude platform, including a biorefinery with a production capacity of 230,000 tons a year of SAF in 2026. TotalEnergies has joined force with SARIA, the European leader in the collection and recovery of organic materials, which will supply the majority of the feedstock supply.

The La Mède biorefinery: This year, La Mède will produce 15,000 tons of SAF for distribution to airports in the south of France.

The Normandy refinery: TotalEnergies has begun coprocessing SAF at its Normandy platform. Coprocessing involves the treatment of both fossil jet fuel and biomass in a standard refining unit. The site’s annual production capacity is 160,000 tons.

The Antwerp refinery in Belgium: An initial project to coprocess 50,000 tons a year of SAF was launched this year. Annual production capacity will subsequently be increased to 80,000 tons a year.

The Leuna refinery in Germany: A coprocessing project for 50,000 tons a year is planned for 2026.

TotalEnergies, supplying SAF to customers in the air industry

TotalEnergies supplies aviation fuels including SAF, in line with blending mandates and the needs of its customers. Those customers include several airlines:

Air France-KLM, with whom the Company has signed a major deal to deliver up to 1.5 million tons of SAF over ten years. This is one of the Group’s largest SAF supply contracts.

Volotea, which has also signed to buy SAF from TotalEnergies until 2029, in order to reduce the emissions of its flights out of several French airports.

TotalEnergies also supplies SAF-blended aviation fuel to several French airports, including Bordeaux, Toulouse, Paris-Le Bourget, Clermont-Ferrand and Saint-Nazaire.

TotalEnergies, a partner committed to SAF research

TotalEnergies is also forging partnerships with aerospace groups to accelerate the sector’s decarbonization. Those partnerships are playing a critical role in understanding the impact of sustainable aviation fuel composition on aircraft, especially for blends of over 50%. They include:

A partnership with Airbus, signed in 2024, to supply over half the company’s needs in Europe, and conduct a shared R&D program to develop fully sustainable fuels.

A partnership with Safran, begun in 2021, that led to the formulation of a SAF that was completely compatible with current aircraft and was used to power a flight by a military helicopter in February 2023.

TotalEnergies is also stepping up its R&D effort, especially in feedstock, which remains one of the challenges to increasing SAF production. The Solaize research center in Lyon has specialist teams coordinating this work.

*** About TotalEnergies TotalEnergies is a global integrated broad energy company that produces and markets energy: oil and biofuels, natural gas, biogas and low-carbon hydrogen, renewables, and electricity.","Intermediate crops that do not compete with food

Catch crops are crops sown between two main crops on the same plot. As such, they do not require additional land and do not compete with human and animal food, while still providing additional income for farmers. They are eligible under European regulations for the production of SAF.

These crops also enable the co-production of plant proteins, thus contributing to the protein sovereignty of France and Europe in animal feed. They also offer numerous agronomic benefits: in particular, they limit soil erosion, improve soil structure, reduce water loss, and contribute to the preservation of biodiversity.

Vegetable oils eligible for transformation into sustainable aviation fuels

As part of this agreement, TotalEnergies and Avril will therefore evaluate the entire value chain, from the selection of plant varieties to the production of biofuels, with the aim of structuring a sustainable French sector.

Avril will supply vegetable oils from intermediate crops to TotalEnergies, which will transform them into sustainable aviation fuel in its French biorefineries and through coprocessing in its French and European refineries.

"" This agreement with Avril represents a major step in the development of a French vegetable oil production sector enabling the production of sustainable aviation fuel. This project represents both an opportunity to create value for the agricultural world and to secure the raw material needed to produce sustainable aviation fuels for manufacturers. SAFs contribute to the energy transition of our customers in the aviation sector and their development is at the heart of our Company's transition strategy ,"" said Valérie Goff, Senior Vice President Renewable Fuels & Chemicals at TotalEnergies .

“ The French sector for sustainable aviation fuels based on intermediate oilseed crops is taking concrete shape. This agreement with TotalEnergies represents a decisive step towards building a local, efficient and competitive model to decarbonize air transport. This innovative model brings together the agricultural world and industrial players around a common objective, drawing on Avril’s historical expertise in structuring sectors. Alongside industrial partners like TotalEnergies, Avril is fully committed to realizing this ambition, which creates value for all stakeholders, from upstream agriculture to downstream industry, ” declared Emmanuel Manichon, Managing Director, Primary Transformation & Renewable Energies at Avril .
