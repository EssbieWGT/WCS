A spokesperson for Cochin International Airport Ltd (CIAL) told news agency PTI that “a technical issue caused the Air India flight to abort the take off.”

Lok Sabha member and Congress leader Hibi Eden was among the passengers on board the flight, identified as AI504.

In a statement, an Air India spokesperson said, “Flight AI504 operating from Kochi to Delhi has been rescheduled to depart later this evening, necessitated by a technical issue detected during the take-off roll.”

“The cockpit crew decided to discontinue the take-off run following standard operating procedures and brought the aircraft back to the bay for maintenance checks,” the spokesperson added.

Live Events

According to the CIAL spokesperson, the airline later informed the airport that it was changing the aircraft. The rescheduled departure is now expected at 1 am on Monday.

Eden, the Ernakulam MP, described the incident in a Facebook post: “Something unusual with this flight AI 504... it just felt like the flight skid on the runway... and hasn't taken off yet...”

Air India said it regretted the inconvenience to passengers. “All passengers have disembarked and our ground colleagues in Kochi are extending support to them,” the spokesperson said.

Flight tracking website Flightradar24.com showed that AI504 was to be operated with an Airbus A321 aircraft.

The incident comes amid a spate of recent technical issues reported by Air India. On August 16, the airline cancelled its Milan-Delhi flight after a last-minute maintenance task was identified during pushback.

On August 3, a Delhi-bound flight from Bhubaneswar was cancelled due to high cabin temperature. On July 31, a Boeing 787-9 bound for London had to abort takeoff at Delhi airport and return to bay because of a technical snag.

Twelve has developed a groundbreaking solution to convert captured CO₂ into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—a potential game-changer for decarbonizing air travel. Despite early successes, Twelve now faces the “first deployment challenge” as it seeks capital to build its first commercial-scale production facility. The capital requirements and unique risk-return profile of Twelve’s facility fall directly in the gap between the smaller checks of high-risk high-return venture capitalists and the larger checks of risk-averse debt providers seeking predictable, if smaller, returns.

However, a refinery of Indian Oil Corporation has now won a certification to use the same oil to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the company chairman AS Sahney said.

However, a refinery of Indian Oil Corporation has now won a certification to use the same oil to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the company chairman AS Sahney said.

SAF is an alternative fuel made from non-petroleum feedstocks that reduces emissions from air transportation. It can be blended up to 50 per cent in conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF or jet fuel), depending on availability. India has mandated 1 per cent SAF blending in jet fuel sold to international airlines from 2027.

IndianOil’s Panipat refinery in Haryana has won the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) ISCC CORSIA certification (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification - ISCC - developed under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to produce SAF from used cooking oil, he said.

“We are the only company in the country to get this certification,” he said.

“The refinery will start producing some 35,000 tonnes per annum of SAF from the end of the calendar year.” The production will be enough to meet the mandated 1 per cent blending requirement for the country in 2027, he added.

Explaining the process, agencies will collect used cooking oil from large users, such as hotel chains, restaurants, and snacks and sweets producing companies like Haldiram, and supply it to Panipat refinery.

Panipat refinery will use this oil to produce SAF, he said.

Large hotels and restaurant chains normally discard cooking oil after one use. At present, this used cooking oil is collected by agencies and exported.

“There is a large amount of such oil available in the country. The only challenge is collection. While it is easy to collect from large hotel chains, a solution needs to be found for collection from small users, including households,” he said.

Parallely, the company has also set up a Rs 5,000 crore plant at its Koyali refinery in Gujarat to produce Butyl Acrylate (BA), which is used in making paints.

The 1,50,000 tonnes per annum Butyl Acrylate plant, only second in India after BPCL’s unit at Kochi refinery, will help end 3,20,000 tonnes of annual paint feedstock that the country currently imports, Sahney noted.

State-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has been at the forefront of innovations, particularly in the areas of green energy, sustainable solutions, and technological advancements. The firm is working on renewable energy sources, like 2G ethanol, fuel cells, bio-diesel, and energy storage devices.

“The paint industry is growing at a CAGR of 13-14 per cent, and the bulk of the raw material they use is imported. In July, we commissioned the BA unit at Koyali refinery, which will eliminate the need to import, saving foreign exchange for the country,” he said. Together with the Kochi plant, the new unit can substitute as much as 80-90 per cent of imports, he said.

On green hydrogen, Sahney said the company awarded a tender for the country’s largest green hydrogen plant to L&T.

“The 10,000 tonnes a year green hydrogen unit at the Panipat refinery will be ready in 27 months,” he said.

Green hydrogen, produced from splitting water using renewable energy, is a clean energy source that only emits water vapour and leaves no residue in the air, unlike coal and oil. It can be used in industries and automobiles as fuel, but the prohibitive production cost has been a stumbling block.

India has relatively cheaper renewable energy (electricity produced from sunlight and wind), which has helped keep green hydrogen production cost at less than $4 per kg, the chairman said, adding that IndianOil will use the fuel in its Panipat refinery. Refineries, currently, use grey hydrogen - hydrogen produced from fossil fuels - in hydrocracking units to produce fuels like petrol and jet fuels.

“IndianOil remains agile and nimble in product innovation and meeting fast-changing energy dynamics,” Sahney said. “A lot of other innovations are in the works, which will be unveiled when they mature.”",https://www.millenniumpost.in/h-upload/2025/08/17/985004-3852j5uwipyzah4raye2vwsaz3oubrxxbqen7781119.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 16:56:24.747412

Toni Chaves President, President of the Hotel Association, says the categorization is a turning point for sargassum use.

“This recognition, supported by IMIPAS research and validated by Conapesca and Semarnat, represents a turning point in the transition of sargassum from an environmental threat to a valuable raw material. It is a decisive step toward its productive use,” said Chaves.

The Riviera Maya Hotel Association and the Mexican Caribbean Hotel Council reiterated their commitment to continue promoting a comprehensive model for the containment, collection, recovery and marketing of sargassum.

Ignacio Muñoz, CEO of The Seas We Love, said that for the first time in Mexico’s history, sargassum has ceased to be a waste product and has become an officially recognized resource within the national fisheries policy.

“This opens the door to a new marine economy that will generate green jobs, sustainable investment and legal certainty for its collection and processing ,” he stressed.

He said that the new categorization in the National Fisheries Charter will enable the issuance of commercial fishing permits for sargassum, moving from the current restricted “promotional fishing” scheme to a broader and more competitive regime.

Likewise, it will provide legal certainty for investors by establishing a clear legal and technical framework regarding its status, fishing zones, authorized vessels and management strategies, which will unlock industrial value-added projects such as those led by The Seas We Love.

Ignacio Muñoz added that its publication will facilitate fisheries management of the resource and pave the way for the development of the Sargassum Fisheries Management Plan with the participation of the productive, academic and government sectors.

Furthermore, its recognition as a strategic biomass validates its potential for the production of fertilizers, biogas, biomethane, sustainable aviation fuel and bioproducts such as construction materials, food supplements, and more, aligned with the circular economy model promoted by the federal government.

“This new recognition represents a major step forward for the Mexican Caribbean and a national milestone in sustainable ocean management,” he said.",https://riviera-maya-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sarlovewiio.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 12:56:33.962877

The failure of the plan highlights the difficulty green aviation has faced getting off the ground, made worse by a government push to force airlines to use more green fuels.
For BA’s partner Velocys – which is yet to sell any green jet fuel to any airline – it ran out of money last year and was taken over by a private consortium.
That’s about 0.2pc of the 11 million tonnes of aviation fuel Britain consumes annually.
For sunseekers hoping to cleanse their conscience with green fuel, a guilt-free future still seems some way off.","For those flying south this summer, the prospect of “green fuel” one day powering their planes down to the south of France or the Med may mean a little less guilt over their climate-destroying air travel.

British factories pumping out climate-friendly aviation fuel have long been a pipe-dream for the aviation industry and some holidaymakers, and it seemed one step closer six years ago when British Airways announced plans for the UK’s first factory to convert waste into jet fuel.

The futuristic plant, to be built by fuels firm Velocys on a field near the Humber estuary, in north Lincolnshire, would see household rubbish destined for landfills turned into thousands of tonnes of green plane fuel, powering the airline into a sustainable future.

Alex Cruz, then-chief executive of BA, said the fuel – known as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) – would be a “game-changer for aviation”.

But six years after British Airways’ Velocys announcement – and a year after the SAF plant should have gone into production – that dream seems as far away as ever.

Velocys’ Humber estuary site remains as an empty field – a recent image shows that the only structure on it is a portaloo.

The failure of the plan highlights the difficulty green aviation has faced getting off the ground, made worse by a government push to force airlines to use more green fuels.

On the back of promises for airlines to use SAF, in 2022, then-prime minister Boris Johnson announced a new policy – known as “jet zero” – to enforce a minimum threshold of green fuel use.

By 2050, he claimed, flying would be zero-carbon, adding: “Sustainable fuels and fully electric planes will achieve guilt-free flying for years to come.”

Under the policy, still in force, British airlines must this year fuel their planes with a minimum of 2pc SAF, ratcheting up to 10pc by 2030 and 22pc by 2040.

That fuel should also be pumping out from a minimum of five new SAF plants, which, Johnson’s policy promised, would be operating by now, creating jobs and helping make the UK “a clean energy superpower”.

Barely any of that has come to pass.

For BA’s partner Velocys – which is yet to sell any green jet fuel to any airline – it ran out of money last year and was taken over by a private consortium. Its leadership team says its plans are only delayed, but similar promises by other UK would-be SAF producers have also so far come to nothing.

It means the only company making SAF in the UK is the Phillips66 refinery on Humberside – and its output is just 20,000 tonnes a year. That’s about 0.2pc of the 11 million tonnes of aviation fuel Britain consumes annually.

So how are UK airlines meeting their obligation to add 2pc SAF to their fuel tanks?

Most of it is being imported, generating jobs not in the UK but mostly in Finland, the Netherlands, the US and Holland. That gap is set to worsen, says the Aviation Environment Federation.

It points out that by 2030, the UK’s SAF obligation will have soared to 10pc, or 1.2 million tonnes, of green fuel – all or most of which will be imported.

“While a number of plants are making progress, the expected amounts they will produce are insufficient to meet the mandate”, it says.

Those imports will not just dash the opportunity for more UK jobs, but also mean flight costs will take off, say experts.

Simone Burgin, a biofuels analyst with Argus Media, said SAF is already far more expensive than conventional jet fuel.

“The European price for SAF stood at $2,280 (£1,681) per metric tonne on Aug 13 – more than three times the price of conventional jet fuel.”

Those high costs are inherent to the way SAF is made – using vast amounts of heat at high pressure to break down waste cooking oil, animal fats, wood, plastics or other organic materials into the smaller molecules needed for jet fuel.

But inflated pricing is adding to that, says the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents 340 global airlines.

It says fuel suppliers are stoking their profit margins with “compliance fees”.

“The fees being imposed on airlines are over twice the prevailing market price premium of SAF. In the EU, airlines face an additional $1.3bn in excess surcharges in 2025. The impact of the compliance fees in the UK is even higher.”

It all suggests Britain’s demand that airlines add SAF to their fuel is doing little to save the planet and nothing for UK jobs, while making aviation increasingly expensive.

Greenhouse gas emissions from UK-based international aviation are surging – equating to 37 million tonnes in 2024 – more than double the 16 million tonnes seen in 1990, and set to grow even faster in the next two decades.

The 300 million passengers who pass through UK airports annually is expected to hit up to 500 million by 2050, with 10 airports planning major expansions.

And globally, aviation emits around a billion tonnes of CO2 and rising – so what difference can SAF really make?

Airlines and aircraft manufacturers point out that it’s still early days for SAF – and as manufacturing steps up, so prices and emissions may decline.

But they too are worried by the lack of realism from a Government that is telling them to use ever more SAF, but doing little to help ensure homegrown supplies.

Jonathon Counsell, sustainability director at IAG, which owns British Airways, said the current plans for boosting SAF output were too weak to meet UK and EU decarbonisation targets.

Airlines want some of the taxes they pay to be deployed to support SAF production.

“SAF is a critical lever to get to net-zero, and to achieve this, the industry needs increased Government support, as mandates alone are not enough,” he said.

“Greater support is essential to bridge the cost gap between SAF and traditional jet fuel, alongside stronger incentives to accelerate production at the scale required to ensure a long-term, affordable supply.”

The Department for Transport, which is steering the policy, points out that next year will see the introduction of its “revenue certainty mechanism” under which companies that build SAF plants will get a guaranteed minimum price, funded by a levy on airlines.

But that levy would add to costs in an industry with a slim profit margin of 3pc to 4pc – and so would go straight on to ticket prices.

Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, said global SAF supply had doubled last year to one million tonnes and was expected to double again this year.

“Like any brand-new industry, progress will be uneven, and there will be failures. There also remains much to do to ensure UK airlines have access to the growing volumes of ‘advanced’ SAF needed to meet the UK mandate.”

Ryanair, Europe’s largest airline, puts it more bluntly: “SAF production needs to be incentivised by governments.” It said the environmental taxes it pays annually need to be reinvested to “accelerate the decarbonisation of the sector”.

A Department for Transport spokesman said: “Not backing SAF is not an option – it is a core part of the global drive to decarbonise aviation.

“There are encouraging signs that the SAF mandate will be met, and we will continue to support the production and use of SAF as the technology matures.”

A Velocys spokesman said the company was seeking to licence its technology to SAF producers worldwide to help them produce more fuel.

He said the amount of money required for the Humber estuary plant was “beyond investment appetite” and investors “remained concerned about the pace of regulatory change” but that it hoped to bring the site to fruition in the “near term”.

The aerospace sector's 14-year backlog and $599 billion sustainable aviation fuel market present opportunities, but execution risks remain high.","The aerospace industry is at a crossroads. Airbus, once a symbol of manufacturing prowess, now faces a stark reality: its Q2 2025 delivery of 300 commercial aircraft—a 68% shortfall from its 820-unit target—has exposed systemic vulnerabilities in global supply chains and corporate execution. This crisis, driven by engine shortages, geopolitical tensions, and internal management challenges, is reshaping investment dynamics across the sector. For investors, the question is no longer whether Airbus can recover, but how the industry will adapt to a new era of volatility.

Supply Chain Constraints: A Perfect Storm of Engine Shortages and Geopolitical Friction

The root of Airbus's delivery crisis lies in its inability to secure LEAP engines for the A320neo program. Safran, the French-Japanese joint venture responsible for these engines, has struggled to meet demand, leaving 17 aircraft in Toulouse as non-functional “gliders.” June 2025 production of 46 A320neos fell short of the 50-unit target, with Forecast International projecting only 625 deliveries for the year—a 16% shortfall. This bottleneck is compounded by geopolitical tensions: U.S. supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which produces critical components for the A350, has seen production drop to one unit in May 2025 due to tariffs and certification delays.

The ripple effects are profound. Airlines are extending the lifespans of aging fleets, accelerating demand for maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services. The MRO sector, already valued at $120 billion, is projected to grow to $290 billion by 2043 as operators prioritize cost efficiency over new purchases. Meanwhile, 65% of aerospace firms cite workforce shortages as a critical constraint, while 49% now view funding risks as a growing threat.

Management Execution Risks: Leadership, Strategy, and the Path to 75 Units/Month

Airbus's corporate governance structure adds another layer of complexity. The Executive Committee, tasked with consensus-driven decision-making, risks slowing responses to urgent production bottlenecks. While the CEO holds final authority, internal alignment remains a hurdle. For instance, the company's acquisition of $94 million in work packages from Spirit AeroSystems aims to reduce supplier dependency but hinges on seamless integration by Q4 2025—a tall order amid existing delays.

Strategic imbalances also persist. Narrowbody aircraft (A320 Family) account for 78% of deliveries but face headwinds from widebody demand in long-haul markets. The A350 and A330neo programs, critical for diversification, are lagging behind targets. Achieving the 2028 goal of 12 A350 units per month will require resolving supplier issues and aligning with operator replacement cycles. Meanwhile, Airbus's $3.6 billion R&D investment in hydrogen-powered aircraft and folding-wing designs, while visionary, remains speculative.

Investment Implications: Resilience in a Fragmented Sector

For investors, the aerospace sector's challenges highlight the importance of resilience and diversification. Key takeaways include:

Resilient Suppliers with Diversified Portfolios:

Rolls-Royce (RYCEF): Despite supply chain disruptions, Rolls-Royce reported a 50% surge in operating profits in H1 2025, driven by operational efficiency and low-carbon innovations. Its Small Modular Reactor (SMR) program and battery energy storage systems (BESS) contracts position it as a leader in energy transition.

GE Additive (GE): Advanced manufacturing firms like GE, with expertise in 3D printing and digital twins, are better equipped to navigate supply chain volatility.

MRO Providers Capitalizing on Aging Fleets:

Lufthansa Technik (LHTG.DE): Despite margin pressures from U.S. tariffs, LHT's expansion into engine maintenance (e.g., CFM Leap 1B) and VIP aircraft interiors signals long-term growth.

AAR Corporation (AIR): The used aircraft market and MRO demand create a tailwind for AAR, which offers comprehensive fleet lifecycle solutions.

Airlines Rebalancing Fleet Strategies:

Operators are increasingly favoring used aircraft and extended maintenance cycles, reducing reliance on new deliveries. This trend benefits MRO firms and used aircraft brokers.

The Road Ahead: Navigating Uncertainty

Airbus's long-term strategy—adding a second A320neo line in Alabama by 2027—signals ambition but requires immediate progress on engine shortages and Alabama facility readiness. For now, the focus should remain on companies with diversified supply chains, sustainable innovation, and scalable MRO capabilities.

The aerospace sector's 14-year backlog and $599 billion sustainable aviation fuel market present opportunities, but execution risks remain high. Investors must weigh near-term volatility against long-term resilience, prioritizing firms that adapt to a world where geopolitical tensions and workforce shortages are the new normal.

Not only is it revolutionizing the visitor experience, but also emerging as a leading player in sustainable tourism globally. This digital shift is leading the charge for Saudi tourism’s new age, providing a more streamlined, sustainable, and engaging experience for visitors.

Smart Tourism Enhances Visitor Experience with Personalized Services

The adoption of smart technologies in tourism goes beyond improving operational efficiency; it focuses on personalizing the traveler’s journey. As Nicholas Nahas, the partner and tourism & hospitality lead at Arthur D. Little, pointed out, the rise of cognitive tourism is giving way to intelligent systems that understand, anticipate, and adapt to traveler behavior in real-time. This includes using AI-powered platforms for trip planning, biometric systems for seamless travel, and AR/VR technologies that bring cultural heritage to life in an interactive way.

With AI leading the way in personalized itineraries, chatbots offer travelers immediate assistance, providing tailored recommendations based on their preferences. The growth of digital assistants helps tourists navigate local attractions with ease, elevating the overall travel experience.

The Role of Neom and the Red Sea Project in Shaping the Future of Tourism

At the forefront of this smart tourism revolution are Neom and the Red Sea Project, two flagship initiatives that are setting new standards in tourism infrastructure. Neom, a futuristic city planned along the Red Sea, aims to use AI-led personalization and immersive digital engagement to create unprecedented travel experiences. The project will integrate smart systems to monitor and manage visitor needs, from accommodation to transportation and entertainment.

Similarly, the Red Sea Project is leveraging smart infrastructure to create seamless and sustainable guest experiences. By deploying IoT sensors to monitor environmental indicators and utilities, the project is set to redefine eco-tourism while ensuring that guests enjoy luxury without compromising on sustainability.

These projects are designed not just for tourism but to support Saudi Arabia’s broader economic diversification by creating new job opportunities, attracting global investors, and advancing technological development in the country.

Challenges and Opportunities in Implementing Smart Tourism

While Saudi Arabia is investing heavily in smart tourism, experts acknowledge that there are challenges ahead. International collaboration is crucial, as many of the most advanced technologies in AI, AR/VR, and IoT are still primarily developed outside the Kingdom. The country must continue to build its local technological capabilities and invest in talent development to close the gap in tourism expertise.

Data governance, cybersecurity, and regulatory standards will also play a key role in ensuring the sustainability and security of these new technologies. Clear guidelines will be essential to facilitate smooth integration and maintain privacy and trust among visitors.

Moreover, the full rollout of essential smart infrastructure, such as 5G networks and cloud systems, is still underway. Delays in implementation could hinder real-time applications, including AI-powered tours and immersive experiences at major tourism sites like Neom and the Red Sea Project.

Sustainability: A Core Focus in Saudi Tourism’s Transformation

The integration of sustainability into smart tourism is a crucial element of Saudi Arabia’s strategy. The focus on regenerative models in tourism emphasizes environmental preservation while offering luxurious and memorable experiences. The use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), energy-efficient tourism infrastructure, and eco-friendly practices are embedded into major tourism projects, making Saudi Arabia’s tourism sector a model for sustainable travel.

The development of smart cities like Neom and sustainable resorts along the Red Sea underscores Saudi Arabia’s ambition to become a global leader in eco-tourism and innovation. As the country continues to develop its tourism sector, these sustainable tourism practices will play a vital role in maintaining a balance between growth and environmental protection.

“If done right, this will be a game-changer, unlocking demand across the entire value chain,” von der Leyen says.
Nonetheless, von der Leyen says the commission is “working closely” with member states and offtakers in steel, chemicals, transport and energy storage to identify priorities.","Investment in the European hydrogen sector is set to grow by 140% this year, claims European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.

The president was speaking during a video message at the Renewable Hydrogen Summit in Brussels, Belgium on Thursday.

In the past year, Europe saw final investment decisions on green hydrogen projects reach over 2 gigawatts – around four times the region’s current installed capacity. Europe is leading in green hydrogen globally with 11 large-scale projects starting construction, while the US lags behind, she adds.

“To put that into perspective, the United States saw just two such decisions during the same period,” von der Leyen notes. “This illustrates European leadership in renewable hydrogen.”

“So why is Europe leading? We set clear targets,” she adds.

The EU has set a target of producing 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen by decade-end. The bloc also set renewable hydrogen binding targets, requiring a minimum use of 42% in industry and 29% in transport, by 2030. Member states are required to turn these targets into law by May 2025, Kallanish notes.

“If done right, this will be a game-changer, unlocking demand across the entire value chain,” von der Leyen says. Yet, she also admits that “big challenges” persist in the industry and “not every project on paper makes it to the construction phase.”

Recent months have seen several companies across Europe either pausing or stopping their hydrogen projects or scaling back their hydrogen ambitions. German energy company Uniper said it is delaying its green investments amid a “sluggish” development of the hydrogen market, having already shelved a 200-megawatt hydrogen-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project in Sweden last month. Similarly, last week bp said it stopped 18 early-stage hydrogen projects.

Nonetheless, von der Leyen says the commission is “working closely” with member states and offtakers in steel, chemicals, transport and energy storage to identify priorities.

“We want to prioritise the infrastructure needed to connect large-scale hydrogen projects with end-users,” she adds. “We will tap into Europe’s vast renewables potential and bring it to our industries to help them decarbonise.”

The president also confirmed that the second round of the European Hydrogen Bank, with a budget of €1.2 billion ($1.3 billion), will be held in December.",https://media.kallanish.com/filer_public/91/f0/91f05193-b6d6-4c4f-a1e5-83611d2b70fb/hydrogen_investment.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 14:56:18.389920

SAF, an alternative to conventional jet fuel, is made from non-petroleum feedstocks and can cut emissions from air transportation. It can be blended up to 50 per cent with traditional aviation turbine fuel (ATF), depending on supply. India has mandated 1% SAF blending in jet fuel supplied to international airlines from 2027.

IndianOil’s Panipat refinery has secured the International Civil Aviation Organization’s ISCC CORSIA certification (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), allowing it to produce 35,000 tonnes of SAF annually starting later this year. The output will be enough to meet India’s initial blending requirement in 2027, Sahney said.

The refinery will source used cooking oil through agencies collecting from major hotel chains, restaurants, and food companies such as Haldiram’s. While large establishments dispose of oil after one use, collection from small businesses and households remains a challenge. Currently, much of India’s used cooking oil is exported.

Parallelly, IndianOil has commissioned a ₹5,000 crore plant at its Koyali refinery in Gujarat to produce 1.5 lakh tonnes per year of Butyl Acrylate (BA), a key ingredient in paints. This is only the second such unit in India after BPCL’s Kochi refinery. With the country importing around 3.2 lakh tonnes of BA annually, the new plant, together with the Kochi unit will substitute 80-90 per cent of imports, saving significant foreign exchange. The paint industry, growing at 13-14 per cent annually, is expected to benefit greatly.

In another major initiative, IndianOil has awarded a contract to Larsen & Toubro to build India’s largest green hydrogen plant at Panipat refinery. The 10,000-tonne-per-year unit, expected to be operational in 27 months, will produce hydrogen by splitting water using renewable energy. Unlike grey hydrogen, which is currently produced from fossil fuels for refinery use, green hydrogen is emission-free and seen as a critical element in India’s energy transition.

India’s relatively low renewable energy costs have brought down green hydrogen production costs to under USD 4 per kg, making it more viable for use in refineries and eventually in industries and automobiles.

Sahney stressed that IndianOil continues to innovate in sustainable energy, from biofuels and 2G ethanol to fuel cells, biodiesel, and energy storage technologies. He highlighted that SAF from Panipat had undergone rigorous lifecycle carbon emission assessments and traceability checks before certification.

Certifications such as ISCC CORSIA not only guarantee environmental and social standards but also create a benchmark for other refiners to scale up SAF production in line with India’s net-zero goal by 2070.

India plans to gradually mandate SAF blending in aviation fuel, beginning with 1 per cent for all international flights in 2027 and rising to 2 per cent the following year. The initiative builds on earlier trials, including SpiceJet’s 2018 test flight using a 75:25 mix of ATF and biofuel, and IndiGo’s 2022 international demonstration flight with a 10 per cent SAF blend.

,,2025-08-17 13:02:12+00:00,Simple Flying,How Many Miles Per Gallon Did Concorde Get? - Simple Flying,Luke Diaz,,,,,https://simpleflying.com/concorde-mpg/,"Looking at publicly available records, we can calculate that Concorde got an equivalent mile-per-gallon fuel burn at its cruising speed of 0.20 mpg.
As such, Concorde fell into a range comparable to a business jet but significantly worse than mainline commercial aircraft.
The data tells us that Concorde used about 5 gallons of aviation fuel for every mile that it flew.
Concorde By The Numbers Concorde pioneered technologies such as double delta-shaped wings, variable engine air intake ramp systems, and supercruise capability.
The Next Generation Of Commercial Supersonic Air Travel Boom Supersonic's proposed Overture airliner is marketed as a generational improvement on Concorde.","Looking at publicly available records, we can calculate that Concorde got an equivalent mile-per-gallon fuel burn at its cruising speed of 0.20 mpg. That is similar to what a Boeing 747 achieves while moving about 400 passengers compared to the Concorde’s 100. Of course, aircraft don’t calculate fuel burn the same way as land vehicles, so let’s get into the details behind these figures.

Concorde carried about 119,500 liters (31,569 gallons) of fuel and burned about 25,629 liters/hour (6,771 gallons/hour) in the air, according to PBS. Data recorded by British Airways indicates an average cruise fuel flow of around 4,800 kg per hour at a true airspeed of roughly 2,150 km/h.

Gallons To The Mile

Concorde’s retirement was often cited as being caused by its poor fuel efficiency, achieving only 17 passenger-miles per gallon. To put that in perspective, the average for airliners ranging from the Boeing 737 to Airbus A380 is 50-80 passenger-mpg. As such, Concorde fell into a range comparable to a business jet but significantly worse than mainline commercial aircraft.

The data tells us that Concorde used about 5 gallons of aviation fuel for every mile that it flew. Naturally, supersonic flight requires more fuel due to increased drag (somewhat negated by flying higher) and powerful engines, but its small capacity brings the number down in comparison. Given the high price of the tickets, the fuel burn didn’t factor into the economics of the supersonic transport as much as many assume.

Concorde was actually most inefficient while taxiing on the ground, when its massively powerful engines could burn up to 2% of the total fuel supply before liftoff. The use of afterburners during takeoff and supersonic acceleration further contributed to high fuel consumption, which led to a higher carbon footprint, raising environmental concerns. Furthermore, it was also extremely loud and prohibitively maintenance-intensive.

Concorde’s Fire-Breathing Heart

The Rolls-Royce Olympus turbojet was already under development when the program to build Concorde began. Developing a new engine for a single aircraft would have been costly, so the existing Olympus Mk 593 Mark 62010 turbojet engine with afterburner (reheat) was chosen. Surprisingly, it remains one of the most fuel-efficient Mach 2-capable powerplants ever made, to this day.

The Olympus 593 was produced as a joint project between Bristol Siddeley Engines Limited and Snecma (Société nationale d'études et de construction de moteurs d'aviation). It is still the only turbojet with an afterburner to power a commercial aircraft, since regular commercial flights by Concorde ceased in October 2003. The engine's overall efficiency in supersonic cruising flight was about 43%, which is still the best thermodynamic result recorded for any jet powerplant of its class.

Concorde By The Numbers

Concorde pioneered technologies such as double delta-shaped wings, variable engine air intake ramp systems, and supercruise capability. Mach 2.02 was determined to be the optimal cruising speed for the best fuel consumption rate possible, and Concorde’s four Olympus engines were based on those used in the Royal Air Force's Avro Vulcan strategic bomber.

It was designed with a tailless configuration, and it was the first airliner to have fly-by-wire flight-control systems and to employ hybrid circuits. The aircraft also featured a full-regime autopilot and autothrottle, fully electrically controlled analogue fly-by-wire flight control systems, a high-pressure hydraulic system, an air data computer for automated monitoring and transmission of aerodynamic measurements, and a fully electrically controlled analog brake-by-wire system.

Concorde was made of aluminum construction using a high-temperature alloy, allowing for conventional manufacture. At 50,000 to 60,000 feet, the airframe’s external skin heated to about 120 degrees Celsius, raising both skin-friction drag and structural weight. Concorde had no auxiliary power unit to save weight, as it only visited large airports with ground air start carts.

More Than Just Transportation

The status and social clout of flying on Concorde surpassed the cost for the supersonic passengers who were often high-net-worth celebrities and captains of industry. These high-flyers were rarely even aware of Concorde's ticket prices, as some didn't personally book them, and corporations were willing to reimburse a fare that avoided a protracted absence of most of their senior leaders. Average ticket prices hovered around $12,000 at the time, which is roughly $20,000 in today's money.

Robert van der Linden, a Curator at the Smithsonian Museum, described his ride on the final flight of the Air France Concorde that bore the registration F-BVFA. He rode along as the jet was delivered from Paris Charles De Gaulle Airport (CDG) to the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Washington Dulles Airport (IAD) in Virginia. The aircraft was the first in service with Air France and had the highest operational hours, at 17,824. His experience upon check-in was recounted as follows:

“I checked in and received my ticket, along with a luggage tag and a special commemorative package. I had walked into a party; champagne was everywhere. Several French passengers stressed to me how honored they felt that the Smithsonian was accepting one of their Concordes. The aircraft had occupied a place in the hearts of the French people, and they felt both great pride and great sadness when the end had finally come.”

Concorde was so costly that the three-and-a-half-hour flying experience was more of an indulgent soiree with free-flowing champagne and caviar, as Luxury Launches describes it. The average passengers weren’t merely 'rich,' but often the ultra-wealthy, with royals and other leaders of the world among the jet's frequent flyers.

The extortionate fares that the plane's main operators, Air France and British Airways, charged passengers for three-hour transatlantic crossings were often paid by a corporate travel budget as an operating expense. For wealthy passengers, the ticket price was offset by the high value of time saved, 'bragging rights,' and networking advantages gained from an incredibly precious and finite luxury experience.

The Next Generation Of Commercial Supersonic Air Travel

Boom Supersonic's proposed Overture airliner is marketed as a generational improvement on Concorde. The program is focused on four broad dimensions, namely economics, environmental footprint, community noise, and operational robustness. The Overture will use a medium-bypass geared turbofan called Symphony, developed with Florida Turbine Technologies and GE Aerospace. Boom targets Mach 1.7 at 60,000 feet, a fast cruise but less than Concorde's Mach 2.02 speed.

The Overture's carbon-fiber composite structure allows higher specific strength, integral acoustic damping, lightning paths, and tighter tolerances for natural laminar flow. The cabin will have the capacity to seat between 65 and 80 passengers comapred to the 92 to 100 that Concorde offered, and Boom Supersonic has committed to certifying the jet with 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Boom estimates that life-cycle CO2 emissions could drop by 80-90% compared with Jet A fuel if a sufficient SAF supply chain is established. The Overture would offer a 50% fuel-burn reduction per passenger, Stage 5 noise compliance, SAF-enabled near-net-zero life-cycle CO2 and a ticket price that would be within the existing business-class band rather than the ultra-luxury niche that Concorde occupied.

Operational resilience and certification are key design principles, as well as reduced maintenance costs. The company plans to produce 15 aircraft per year from a purpose-built facility in Greensboro, North Carolina, targeting a fleet of 300-500 by 2040. In the absence of the Concorde, a new SST may finally arrive.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mp3.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 11:57:18.760946

ISCC CORSIA is a certification system for compliance with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) criteria for SAF. It is a prerequisite for commercial SAF production. According to IOC, the certification also sets a benchmark for other domestic refiners and industry players to scale up SAF production.

SAF is a biofuel that is produced from sustainable feedstocks and has chemistry similar to conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF) or jet fuel, which is derived from crude oil. This means that existing aircraft engines can easily use the SAF-ATF blend. For instance, Airbus claims that all its aircraft are capable of flying on a maximum 50 per cent blend of SAF and conventional fuel. Various Indian airlines have already operated successfully a few test and demonstration flights using jet fuel doped with SAF in various proportions. According to aviation industry and energy experts, SAF alone is likely to account for over 60 per cent of the global aviation industry’s decarbonisation efforts.

According to Sahney, given that Europe already has SAF blending mandates, European airlines could be the first potential buyers of IOC’s SAF, which they can buy when they fly into India.

The refiner is also exploring export opportunities, given that SAF demand is expected to shoot up globally over the coming years.

The year 2027 will be an important one for adoption of SAF globally with the mandatory phase of CORSIA kicking in. CORSIA, which applies to international flights, would require airlines globally to offset any growth in carbon dioxide emissions beyond the 2020 levels. Using jet fuel blended with SAF is one of the ways through which carriers can keep their emissions under permissible levels.

India, too, will have to comply with the mandatory phase starting 2027. In line with the CORSIA framework, India’s National Biofuel Coordination Committee (NBCC) has set the initial indicative targets for blending of SAF with jet fuel 2027 onwards, starting with international flights. The indicative targets are: 1 per cent blending in 2027 and 2 per cent in 2028. The government is expected to announce SAF blending mandates for domestic flights in India as well, but only after blending for international flights begins 2027 onwards.

The government has been working on a roadmap for introduction of SAF in domestic flights and there were indications earlier that some sort of a blending mandate or recommendation could take effect over the next couple of years. However, given the high cost of production of the biofuel and opposition from airlines over apprehensions of fuel cost escalation, the government is now looking at introducing any such mandate only from 2027 or beyond. According to industry insiders, SAF currently costs around three times the price of regular jet fuel.

While IOC has received the certification for the used cooking oil pathway for SAF production, the company is also working on setting up units based on the alcohol-to-jet pathway, which involves using ethanol as a feedstock to make SAF. A few other companies in India are also working to build units based on the various SAF manufacturing pathways. All such technologies and units need to be certified before they can start commercial operations.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/08/aviation.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 11:57:31.234546

The airline aims to create amenity kits that passengers will repurpose after their flights.

Other airlines are also implementing sustainable practices, like fuel-efficient routes and electric ground vehicles.

Singapore Airlines wants you to reuse their amenity kit after your flight.

The company has many sustainability initiatives, including scaling its use of sustainable aviation fuel, optimizing its routes for fuel efficiency and reducing its energy usage in ground operations. But the airline said that making its amenity kits last past the flight is another way to keep its operations eco-friendly.

“One of the things that we see across the company now is that sustainability is top of mind, but we balance that with what our customers expect, with what they need.” Timothy Chua, Singapore Airlines’ Vice President of Lounge Development and Inflight Operations, told USA TODAY in an interview. “At all times, we deliver something that is helpful and well-considered.”

Across the industry, airlines have been making efforts to reduce their carbon footprints as well as their waste production in their operations. Companies try to strike a balance between minimizing waste from onboard services like amenity kits and food and beverages, while also making sure passengers have everything they need to stay comfortable, especially on long-haul flights.

Many U.S. airlines with long international routes also provide amenity kits on long-haul flights, most commonly overnight flights to overseas destinations. These are often available even in economy, though the specific kits usually vary by class of service

Sustainable amenity kits

Chua said Singapore works with its suppliers to make sure all the components in the amenity kit, like lotion bottles, are as recyclable or sustainable as possible.

“What we do is now, when we do our discussions with our vendors, we take a look at what materials they use and how easily recyclable they can be done,” he said. “One of the things that works for us is that it’s not just ask asking for it, they themselves are looking for it.”

In business class, Singapore Airlines provides amenity kits by Le Labo with lip balm, hand cream, and facial moisturizing mist. The airline also provides eye masks, ear plugs and other items on request, as well as toothbrushes, shaving kits and moisturizers in the lavatories.

But equally as importantly, the company wants to make sure the kit itself is appealing and versatile enough that passengers will want to take it off the plane to use the bag for other purposes.

“Could it be a travel pack for your passports, your tickets?” he said. “We want to make it attractive for people to reuse.”

The airline wouldn’t reveal specific data on how many of its amenity kits leave the plane. Chua said that, anecdotally, the company is satisfied that they are being reused at a good rate.

He added that the airline is experimenting with an amenity kit on demand model, in which passengers have to request one, rather than one being available at every seat when they board. He said that this can help improve sustainability by ensuring passengers who don’t need the amenity kit won’t soil one, and he said so far, customer feedback to the tests has been positive.

Re-using pillows, blankets

Singapore Airlines also boosts its sustainability in a number of other ways. According to the airline, keeping a young, fuel-efficient fleet is one of their top goals, but airline executives also do lifecycle analyses for things like pillows and blankets and other onboard products to ensure they are reusable for an extended period.

“When we work in the design we also talk about cycle time. We know how long a product will last, we want to make sure it will last a decent time,"" Chua said. Such reusability reduces the airline’s overall waste footprint.

What US airlines are doing

Across the industry, airlines are trying to go greener. As a whole, aviation has a goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050, although that gets less likely by the year as sustainable aviation fuel development and scaling stalls.

Meanwhile, major airlines are taking other steps to improve their sustainability practices where they can.

American Airlines, for example, is working with the FAA to develop more fuel efficient routes for its flights.

“American is working with the FAA to design and execute more efficient descent procedures that allow aircraft to safely glide to airports from cruising altitude, instead of more traditional stair-step descents that require more thrust,” a graphic about the airline’s sustainability practices says. “It is estimated that these procedures could save up to 11 million gallons of fuel annually at our (Charlotte) and (Phoenix) hubs.” Delta has an initiative to electrify its ground vehicles as much as possible. According to the airline, 42% of its core fleet of ground vehicles is already electrified, and the company is on track to reach 100% electrification by 2035.

In 2024, United introduced more eco-friendly meal service items in its economy cabins, in an effort to reduce the amount of single-use plastics distributed on its flights. The new service items include 100% bamboo cutlery, napkins made from 70% recycled materials and more non-plastic packaging materials.

However, a refinery of IndianOil has now won a certification to use the same oil to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the company chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney said.

SAF is an alternative fuel made from non-petroleum feedstocks that reduces emissions from air transportation.

It can be blended up to 50 per cent in conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF or jet fuel), depending on availability. India has mandated 1 per cent SAF blending in jet fuel sold to international airlines from 2027.

IndianOil's Panipat refinery in Haryana has won the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) ISCC CORSIA certification (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification - ISCC - developed under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to produce SAF from used cooking oil, he said.

""We are the only company in the country to get this certification,"" he said.

""The refinery will start producing some 35,000 tonnes per annum of SAF from the end of the calendar year.""

The production will be enough to meet the mandated 1 per cent blending requirement for the country in 2027, he added.

Explaining the process, agencies will collect used cooking oil from large users, such as hotel chains, restaurants, and snacks and sweets producing companies like Haldiram, and supply it to Panipat refinery.

Panipat refinery will use this oil to produce SAF, he said.

Large hotels and restaurant chains normally discard cooking oil after one use.

At present, this used cooking oil is collected by agencies and exported.

""There is a large amount of such oil available in the country. The only challenge is collection.

""While it is easy to collect from large hotel chains, a solution needs to be found for collection from small users, including households,"" he said.

Parallely, the company has also set up a Rs 5,000 crore plant at its Koyali refinery in Gujarat to produce Butyl Acrylate (BA), which is used in making paints.

The 150,000 tonnes per annum Butyl Acrylate plant, only second in India after BPCL's unit at Kochi refinery, will help end 320,000 tonnes of annual paint feedstock that the country currently imports, Sahney noted.

State-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has been at the forefront of innovations, particularly in the areas of green energy, sustainable solutions, and technological advancements.

The firm is working on renewable energy sources, like 2G ethanol, fuel cells, bio-diesel, and energy storage devices.

""The paint industry is growing at a CAGR of 13-14 per cent, and the bulk of the raw material they use is imported.

In July, we commissioned the BA unit at Koyali refinery, which will eliminate the need to import, saving foreign exchange for the country,"" he said.

Together with the Kochi plant, the new unit can substitute as much as 80-90 per cent of imports, he said.

On green hydrogen, Sahney said the company awarded a tender for the country's largest green hydrogen plant to L&T.

""The 10,000 tonnes a year green hydrogen unit at the Panipat refinery will be ready in 27 months,"" he said.

Green hydrogen, produced from splitting water using renewable energy, is a clean energy source that only emits water vapour and leaves no residue in the air, unlike coal and oil. It can be used in industries and automobiles as fuel, but the prohibitive production cost has been a stumbling block.

India has relatively cheaper renewable energy (electricity produced from sunlight and wind), which has helped keep green hydrogen production cost at less than $4 per kg, the chairman said, adding that IndianOil will use the fuel in its Panipat refinery.

Refineries, currently, use grey hydrogen - hydrogen produced from fossil fuels - in hydrocracking units to produce fuels like petrol and jet fuels.

""IndianOil remains agile and nimble in product innovation and meeting fast-changing energy dynamics,"" Sahney said.

""A lot of other innovations are in the works, which will be unveiled when they mature.""

Explaining the SAF certification process, he said, ""SAF produced at IOC's Panipat refinery has undergone rigorous assessment for lifecycle carbon emissions and traceability, creating a clear pathway for Indian airlines to integrate certified SAF into their operations.""

Certifications like ISCC CORSIA ensure the fuel meets environmental and social standards.

The certification also sets a benchmark for other domestic refiners and industry players to scale up SAF production, in line with the government's vision of achieving net-zero emissions by 2070.

With this recognition, IOC has once again reaffirmed its role as a trailblazer in India's energy transition, bringing India closer to a greener and cleaner aviation future.

India plans to mandate blending of SAF with conventional ATF in a staged manner.

One per cent SAF blending in ATF sold to all international flights is to start from 2017 and increase to 2 per cent in the following year.

SpiceJet had flown a test flight, using a blend of 75 per cent regular ATF and 25 per cent biofuel in August 2018.

Subsequently, IndiGo did a demonstration flight using a 10 per cent SAF blend on an international flight in February 2022.

While CORSIA is a key part of the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) strategy to achieve carbon-neutral growth for international flights going ahead, Cotecna is a leading provider of testing, inspection and certification services.",https://im.rediff.com/money/2025/aug/17aug-used-oil.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 08:56:11.202173

From kitchens to runways

SAF is derived from non-petroleum feedstocks and can be blended up to 50 per cent with conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF). To source raw material, agencies will collect used cooking oil from hotels, restaurant chains, and major snack producers such as Haldiram before supplying it to the Panipat refinery. Currently, much of this oil is exported, but IOC’s initiative aims to build a domestic supply chain.While collection from large establishments is manageable, Sahney noted that tapping into smaller users and households remains a challenge. “There is significant availability of used cooking oil in the country, but the issue lies in building an efficient collection system,” he added.

Expanding green energy portfolio

Alongside SAF, IOC has also commissioned a ₹5,000-crore Butyl Acrylate (BA) unit at its Koyali refinery in Gujarat — the country’s second such facility after BPCL’s Kochi plant. With a capacity of 1,50,000 tonnes per annum, the plant will substantially reduce India’s annual import of 3,20,000 tonnes of paint feedstock.The company is also investing in green hydrogen, with a 10,000-tonne-per-year plant coming up at Panipat in partnership with L&T. Expected to be commissioned in 27 months, the facility will be India’s largest green hydrogen unit, supporting the refinery’s shift from fossil-based “grey” hydrogen.

A step towards net-zero

According to IOC, SAF produced at Panipat has undergone rigorous lifecycle emission assessments, ensuring compliance with environmental and social standards. The certification paves the way for Indian airlines to adopt SAF as part of their decarbonisation strategies.India has already outlined a phased SAF blending mandate — beginning with 1 per cent in 2027 and gradually increasing thereafter. Airlines such as SpiceJet and IndiGo have conducted SAF test flights in recent years, underscoring the industry’s readiness for transition.“With this recognition, IOC reaffirms its role as a trailblazer in India’s energy transition,” Sahney said. “These innovations bring us closer to the government’s vision of net-zero emissions by 2070, while ensuring that Indian aviation contributes to global sustainability goals.”",https://www.newsinc24.com/uploads/news/India_Oil.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 10:56:28.242688

IndianOil’s Panipat refinery has received international certification to convert used cooking oil from homes and restaurants into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), company chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney said. The refinery has obtained the ICAO’s ISCC CORSIA certification, developed under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, to produce SAF from used cooking oil, PTI reported. “We are the only company in the country to get this certification,” Sahney said. “The refinery will start producing some 35,000 tonnes per annum of SAF from the end of the calendar year.” According to him, this production capacity will be sufficient to meet India’s requirement of blending 1 per cent SAF with conventional jet fuel by 2027. Under government rules, international airlines will need to use 1 per cent SAF-blended aviation turbine fuel (ATF) starting that year. SAF can be mixed with ATF up to 50 per cent. Collection agencies will source used cooking oil from large establishments such as hotels, restaurants, and companies including Haldiram, and supply it to the Panipat refinery. The facility will process the oil into SAF. “There is a large amount of such oil available in the country. The only challenge is collection. While it is easy to collect from large hotel chains, a solution needs to be found for collection from small users, including households,” Sahney added. He explained that SAF produced at Panipat has “undergone rigorous assessment for lifecycle carbon emissions and traceability, creating a clear pathway for Indian airlines to integrate certified SAF into their operations.”Other initiatives IndianOil also commissioned a Rs 5,000 crore Butyl Acrylate (BA) unit at its Koyali refinery in Gujarat, used in paint manufacturing. The 1,50,000 tonnes per year facility is the second in India after BPCL’s Kochi unit. “The paint industry is growing at a CAGR of 13-14 per cent, and the bulk of the raw material they use is imported. In July, we commissioned the BA unit at Koyali refinery, which will eliminate the need to import, saving foreign exchange for the country,” Sahney said. He added that together with BPCL’s Kochi facility, the new unit can replace 80-90 per cent of India’s BA imports. Sahney also announced that L&T has been selected to construct the nation’s largest green hydrogen facility at Panipat. “The 10,000 tonnes a year green hydrogen unit at the Panipat refinery will be ready in 27 months,” he said. The fuel will replace grey hydrogen currently used at refineries, lowering the carbon footprint of operations. Green hydrogen, produced by splitting water using renewable energy, emits only water vapour. Despite high global production costs, Sahney noted that India’s comparatively low-cost renewable power keeps the price under USD 4 per kg. “IndianOil remains agile and nimble in product innovation and meeting fast-changing energy dynamics. A lot of other innovations are in the works, which will be unveiled when they mature,” Sahney said. He added that IndianOil’s SAF certification sets a benchmark for other refiners to increase production, helping the aviation sector lower emissions and supporting India’s 2070 net-zero target.

SAF is an alternative fuel made from non-petroleum feedstocks that reduces emissions from air transportation. It can be blended up to 50 per cent in conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF or jet fuel), depending on availability. India has mandated 1 per cent SAF blending in jet fuel sold to international airlines from 2027.

IndianOil's Panipat refinery in Haryana has won the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) ISCC CORSIA certification (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification - ISCC - developed under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to produce SAF from used cooking oil, he said.

""We are the only company in the country to get this certification,"" he said.

""The refinery will start producing some 35,000 tonnes per annum of SAF from the end of the calendar year."" The production will be enough to meet the mandated 1 per cent blending requirement for the country in 2027, he added.

Explaining the process, agencies will collect used cooking oil from large users, such as hotel chains, restaurants, and snacks and sweets producing companies like Haldiram, and supply it to Panipat refinery.

Panipat refinery will use this oil to produce SAF, he said.

Large hotels and restaurant chains normally discard cooking oil after one use. At present, this used cooking oil is collected by agencies and exported.

""There is a large amount of such oil available in the country. The only challenge is collection. While it is easy to collect from large hotel chains, a solution needs to be found for collection from small users, including households,"" he said.

Parallely, the company has also set up a ₹5,000 crore plant at its Koyali refinery in Gujarat to produce Butyl Acrylate (BA), which is used in making paints.

The 1,50,000 tonnes per annum Butyl Acrylate plant, only second in India after BPCL's unit at Kochi refinery, will help end 3,20,000 tonnes of annual paint feedstock that the country currently imports, Sahney noted.

State-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has been at the forefront of innovations, particularly in the areas of green energy, sustainable solutions, and technological advancements. The firm is working on renewable energy sources, like 2G ethanol, fuel cells, bio-diesel, and energy storage devices.

""The paint industry is growing at a CAGR of 13-14 per cent, and the bulk of the raw material they use is imported. In July, we commissioned the BA unit at Koyali refinery, which will eliminate the need to import, saving foreign exchange for the country,"" he said.

Together with the Kochi plant, the new unit can substitute as much as 80-90 per cent of imports, he said.

On green hydrogen, Sahney said the company awarded a tender for the country's largest green hydrogen plant to L&amp;T.

""The 10,000 tonnes a year green hydrogen unit at the Panipat refinery will be ready in 27 months,"" he said.

Green hydrogen, produced from splitting water using renewable energy, is a clean energy source that only emits water vapour and leaves no residue in the air, unlike coal and oil. It can be used in industries and automobiles as fuel, but the prohibitive production cost has been a stumbling block.

India has relatively cheaper renewable energy (electricity produced from sunlight and wind), which has helped keep green hydrogen production cost at less than USD 4 per kg, the chairman said, adding that IndianOil will use the fuel in its Panipat refinery.

Refineries, currently, use grey hydrogen - hydrogen produced from fossil fuels - in hydrocracking units to produce fuels like petrol and jet fuels.

""IndianOil remains agile and nimble in product innovation and meeting fast-changing energy dynamics,"" Sahney said. ""A lot of other innovations are in the works, which will be unveiled when they mature."" Explaining the SAF certification process, he said, ""SAF produced at IOC's Panipat refinery has undergone rigorous assessment for lifecycle carbon emissions and traceability, creating a clear pathway for Indian airlines to integrate certified SAF into their operations"".

Certifications like ISCC CORSIA ensure the fuel meets environmental and social standards.

The certification also sets a benchmark for other domestic refiners and industry players to scale up SAF production, in line with the government's vision of achieving net-zero emissions by 2070.

With this recognition, IOC has once again reaffirmed its role as a trailblazer in India's energy transition, bringing India closer to a greener and cleaner aviation future.

India plans to mandate blending of SAF with conventional ATF in a staged manner. One per cent SAF blending in ATF sold to all international flights is to start from 2017 and increase to 2 per cent in the following year.

SpiceJet had flown a test flight, using a blend of 75 per cent regular ATF and 25 per cent biofuel in August 2018. Subsequently, IndiGo did a demonstration flight using a 10 per cent SAF blend on an international flight in February 2022.

While CORSIA is a key part of the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) strategy to achieve carbon-neutral growth for international flights going ahead, Cotecna is a leading provider of testing, inspection and certification services.

SAF là nhiên liệu hàng không được sản xuất từ các nguồn nguyên liệu tái tạo, thay thế cho nhiên liệu hóa thạch truyền thống. SAF có khả năng giảm tới 80% lượng phát thải CO₂ so với nhiên liệu hàng không truyền thống. Đây được xem là giải pháp then chốt của ngành hàng không toàn cầu để giảm phát thải, hướng tới mục tiêu Net Zero - phát thải ròng bằng 0 - vào năm 2050.

Petrolimex là đơn vị đầu tiên tại Việt Nam nhập khẩu hydrocarbon được tổng hợp từ nguyên liệu có nguồn gốc sinh học/tái tạo (synthetic blending components - SBC). Petrolimex cũng là đơn vị đầu tiên tại Việt Nam làm chủ công nghệ pha chế SAF từ SBC tuân thủ các tiêu chuẩn quốc tế nghiêm ngặt như EI 1533, ASTM D7566, DEF STAN 91-091,... và Tiêu chuẩn Việt Nam – TCVN 14414:2025.

Sản phẩm SAF đã được Công ty Cổ phần Nhiên liệu bay Petrolimex (Petrolimex Aviation) cung cấp, tra nạp thành công cho các chuyến bay thương mại trong nước. Với ý nghĩa đặc biệt này, Hệ thống phối trộn nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững (SAF) tại Tổng kho Xăng dầu Nhà Bè được Tập đoàn Xăng dầu Việt Nam ghi nhận là một trong các công trình tiêu biểu chào mừng kỷ niệm 70 năm thành lập Tập đoàn Xăng dầu Việt Nam (12/01/1956 – 12/01/2026).

Phát biểu tại sự kiện, Ủy viên BCH Đảng bộ Chính phủ, Bí thư Đảng ủy, Chủ tịch HĐQT Petrolimex Phạm Văn Thanh cho biết: “Petrolimex chủ động đầu tư, nghiên cứu, làm chủ công nghệ pha chế SAF tại Tổng kho Xăng dầu Nhà Bè. Petrolimex cũng là đơn vị đầu tiên tại Việt Nam nhập khẩu SBC dùng để pha chế SAF.

Thành công này thể hiện cam kết mạnh mẽ của Tập đoàn trong hành trình chuyển đổi xanh, đồng hành cùng Chính phủ, các hãng hàng không và toàn xã hội hướng tới phát triển bền vững”.

Cục trưởng Cục Hàng không Việt Nam, ông Uông Việt Dũng, đánh giá cao Tập đoàn Xăng dầu Việt Nam và Petrolimex Aviation đi đầu trong việc triển khai nghiên cứu, pha chế và cung ứng SAF. Lãnh đạo Cục Hàng không Việt Nam nhấn mạnh: “Việc ra mắt sản phẩm SAF không chỉ có ý nghĩa về mặt thương mại mà còn mang ý nghĩa chiến lược lâu dài, tạo tiền đề xây dựng chuỗi cung ứng SAF bền vững trong nước; đáp ứng yêu cầu của thị trường quốc tế; khuyến khích hợp tác giữa các hãng hàng không, đơn vị cung cấp nhiên liệu, cơ quan quản lý và các tổ chức tài chính nhằm mở rộng quy mô sử dụng SAF tại Việt Nam”.

Hệ thống cung ứng, tra nạp nhiên liệu hàng không của Petrolimex Aviation đạt chứng nhận quốc tế ISCC EU và ISCC CORSIA – các tiêu chuẩn hàng đầu về tính bền vững và giảm phát thải carbon, được công nhận tại hơn 130 quốc gia. Ông Nguyễn Văn Học – Tổng Giám đốc Petrolimex Aviation chia sẻ, việc được cấp chứng nhận quốc tế uy tín nêu trên là minh chứng cho năng lực và tính chuyên nghiệp của Petrolimex trong triển khai SAF. Petrolimex Aviation sẵn sàng đồng hành cùng các đối tác trong và ngoài nước hướng tới ngành hàng không xanh, an toàn và bền vững.

Ký kết thỏa thuận hợp tác tiêu thụ SAF với Vietjet và AEG Fuels

Tại sự kiện, Petrolimex Aviation ký kết thỏa thuận hợp tác tiêu thụ SAF với Công ty Cổ phần Hàng không Vietjet (Vietjet).

Theo thỏa thuận, Petrolimex Aviation sẽ tra nạp toàn bộ 1.200 m³ SAF đầu tiên được pha trộn tại Việt Nam cho các chuyến bay của Vietjet, đồng thời chuyển giao Bằng chứng Bền vững – Proof of Sustainability (PoS) theo tiêu chuẩn ISCC EU. Đây là dấu mốc quan trọng, khẳng định cam kết của hai bên trong việc giảm phát thải khí carbon và phát triển ngành hàng không xanh tại Việt Nam.

Ông Tô Việt Thắng – Phó Tổng Giám đốc Thường trực Vietjet cho biết: “Thỏa thuận hợp tác tiêu thụ SAF hôm nay giữa Vietjet và Petrolimex Aviation thể hiện cam kết của hai doanh nghiệp, ngành hàng không hướng tới các mục tiêu phát triển xanh, bền vững.

Với tổng cộng 576 tàu bay hiện đại đã đặt hàng, đội bay xanh của Vietjet sử dụng SAF sẽ góp phần giảm đáng kể lượng khí thải, bảo vệ môi trường, tiên phong sử dụng nhiên liệu sạch, góp phần hiện thực hóa khát vọng phát triển, vươn mình trong kỷ nguyên hội nhập toàn cầu của đất nước.”

Cũng trong khuôn khổ sự kiện, Petrolimex Aviation ký kết hợp tác với AEG Fuels – đối tác quốc tế chiến lược hàng đầu trong lĩnh vực cung ứng SAF.

Sự hợp tác này mở rộng mạng lưới kết nối của Petrolimex Aviation ra thị trường toàn cầu, tạo tiền đề để SAF sản xuất tại Việt Nam tiếp cận khách hàng quốc tế và thúc đẩy quá trình chuyển đổi xanh của ngành hàng không.

Originally scheduled to reach Incheon at 7.50pm on 13 August, AirAsia Flight D7 506 reportedly touched down at Gimpo, 35km from Incheon, at 8.08pm after circling in the air. Passengers on the flight said after the captain announced they had arrived at Incheon, people stood up to retrieve their bags from the overhead compartments, but some looked out of the windows and checked their phones, and realised they were at Gimpo.

“Everyone panicked. It seemed the cabin crew didn’t know we had landed at Gimpo until passengers told them,” Lee Mi-hyun, a passenger in her 40s who was returning from a trip to Malaysia with her husband and eight-year-old daughter, told The Korea Herald. “One crew member even said she needed to call her parents, who were waiting for her at Incheon International Airport.”

What caused the flight to divert to Gimpo was “turbulence” over Incheon Airport. The flight departed for Incheon about two hours later at 10.17pm after refuelling, according to the Korea Airports Corp.

“They appeared just as confused as the passengers. No water was offered and there was almost no food left on board, leaving passengers with children upset. Some even said they would rather get off at Gimpo before the plane departed for Incheon,” Lee said.

“During the two hours before we departed for Incheon again, there was no clear explanation of what caused the landing error or any effort to reassure passengers,” another passenger told The Korea Herald.

In a statement on Aug 14, AirAsia X clarified that the flight was diverted to Gimpo for refuelling following air traffic congestion at Incheon due to adverse weather conditions.

AirAsia X (AAX) said flight D7506 diverted to Gimpo International Airport (GMP) earlier in the evening for refuelling following air traffic congestion at ICN due to adverse weather conditions. The airline said “a miscommunication occurred in the cabin crew announcement upon landing, which the captain promptly clarified, confirming the diversion to Gimpo Airport due to adverse weather and refuelling. The captain also apologised to guests for the inconvenience, reassuring them that the landing at Gimpo was to to refuel and that the aircraft will proceed to its original destination.

Benyamin Ismail, the CEO of AirAsia X said: “This was an unforeseen situation caused by adverse weather in Incheon. Following the potential delay and the risk of landing with fuel below requirement, the aircraft was diverted to Gimpo International Airport in the interest of safety for refuelling. Upon completing all safety procedures, the aircraft subsequently took off for Incheon International Airport, where guests eventually disembarked. We will also review our internal announcements and onboard information-sharing processes to ensure greater clarity in such situations. We thank our guests for their understanding and cooperation during this operational adjustment, which was necessary to ensure the safety of everyone on board. As a good will gesture, AAX will be extending travel vouchers and will be reaching out to the affected guests directly.”

This is not the first time AirAsia has gotten the wrong airport. In 2015, an AirAsia flight from Sydney to Malaysia ended up in Melbourne instead when the pilot entered the wrong coordinates into the internal navigation system, an air safety investigation found. The Airbus A330 was scheduled to leave Sydney international airport at 11.55am on 10 March 2015, and arrive in Kuala Lumpur just under nine hours later. Instead, through a combination of data entry errors, crew ignoring unexplained chimes from the computer system, and bad weather in Sydney, it landed in Melbourne just after 2pm.

Melbourne airport is 722km southwest of Sydney. Kuala Lumpur is 6,611km northwest.

According to a report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) the problem occurred when faulty headsets prompted the captain and first officer to swap their usual pre-flight checks. Ordinarily, the report said, the captain would conduct an external inspection of the plane while the first officer stayed in the cockpit and, among other tasks, completed the position initialisation and alignment procedures.",https://asianaviation.com/wp-content/uploads/airasia-fly-2.jpeg,N,,2025-08-17 02:58:48.070827

These flights are operated by Air Hong Kong, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Cathay Group, which principally operates express cargo services for DHL Express.
Our continued investment in this area aligns with DHL Group’s Strategy 2030, which recognises ‘green logistics of choice’ as one of the four bottom lines.” This SAF deal builds on the long-standing partnership between DHL Express and the Cathay Group, including through Air Hong Kong.
For more than two decades, Air Hong Kong has played a vital role in DHL Express’s Asia Pacific network.
Cathay Director Cargo Tom Owen said: “This partnership marks the first SAF uplift on Air Hong Kong flights, a key milestone for Cathay as we continue to expand the SAF usage across our global network.","DHL Express and the Cathay Group have entered into a new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) partnership that reinforces their shared commitment to reducing carbon emissions in the air cargo industry. Under the agreement, Cathay will supply DHL Express with 2,400 tonnes of SAF for international flights departing from three airports in Asia: Seoul Incheon International Airport, Tokyo Narita International Airport, and Singapore Changi Airport. These flights are operated by Air Hong Kong, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Cathay Group, which principally operates express cargo services for DHL Express.

Continuing through 2025, the partnership is expected to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 7,190 tonnes — equivalent to the emissions of over 100 flights from Hong Kong to Singapore with an Airbus 330 freighter.

DHL Express Senior Vice President for Network Operations & Aviation – Asia Pacific Peter Bardens said: “Sustainable aviation fuel currently accounts for less than 1% of the total global jet fuel consumption, yet air transport is one of our biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Our decision to expand our SAF usage in Asia with Cathay is another important step that we have taken to drive momentum in SAF production and demand. DHL Express is at the forefront of SAF adoption, and we look forward to seeing more partners and customers join us on this journey to build a more robust SAF ecosystem in Asia. Our continued investment in this area aligns with DHL Group’s Strategy 2030, which recognises ‘green logistics of choice’ as one of the four bottom lines.”

This SAF deal builds on the long-standing partnership between DHL Express and the Cathay Group, including through Air Hong Kong. For more than two decades, Air Hong Kong has played a vital role in DHL Express’s Asia Pacific network. This latest collaboration builds on that strong foundation and paves the way for deeper cooperation in advancing SAF.

Cathay Director Cargo Tom Owen said: “This partnership marks the first SAF uplift on Air Hong Kong flights, a key milestone for Cathay as we continue to expand the SAF usage across our global network. SAF remains a core pillar of our strategy to address our carbon emissions, and collaboration is essential to scaling its use. We are excited to be working with like-minded partners like DHL Express to make SAF more accessible and scalable, particularly in Asia.” 3

This collaboration makes DHL Express the latest strategic partner of Cathay’s Corporate SAF Programme, an initiative launched in 2022 to support corporate partners in addressing greenhouse gas emissions from business travel and airfreight through the use of SAF. In 2024, the Corporate SAF Programme enabled the use of over 6,000 tonnes of SAF, with 16 partners participating, including HSBC, AIA and Standard Chartered.

Cathay has been steadily expanding its SAF efforts across the region. Earlier in 2025, the Group entered into an agreement with Sinopec to uplift SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland at Hong Kong International Airport, marking the first such export by Sinopec to Hong Kong. Additionally, Cathay has partnered with SK Energy to secure SAF supply in South Korea from 2025 to 2027. Apart from working closely with suppliers, the Group also co-initiated the Hong Kong Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition (HKSAFC) to collectively drive policy development and adoption of SAF locally. These initiatives reflect Cathay’s mission to expand the use of SAF within its network and foster a regional SAF ecosystem.",https://asianaviation.com/wp-content/uploads/cdn.uc_.assets.prezly-9.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 22:56:18.148018

Vertical Integration as a Natural Trade Shield However, promoter-led businesses can be vulnerable due to the same characteristics that make them strong.","By Dr. Neha Gosain, PhD, Assistant Professor, IILM New Delhi

While the world is going through a dramatic rise in geopolitical shifts and tariff battles, there is a class of shareholders in the Indian Inc. that is holding the ground for their firms. Corporations with promoter ownership of more than an average 50% are termed as promoter-owned firms. Indian firms like Reliance Industries Ltd., the Tata Group, Adani Group, and Bajaj Auto are among a few that have shown a surprising resilience against the global upheavals. These firms are seen to acquire many structural advantages compared to other firms, helping them ride the tariff shock waves. But can their defining advantages become their Achilles’ heel?

Due to their concentrated ownership and centralized decision-making, promoter-led companies are more agile in global crises. Tata Steel’s swift response to the US’s 25% steel tariff in 2018—selling its declining US arm and expanding in Europe in three years—is a good example. Reliance Industries also anticipated trade tensions by reducing dependency on Chinese petrochemical imports and building a large integrated petrochemical and refining complex in Jamnagar by 2023. Because they can make bold, long-term bets without the quarterly earnings pressures that publicly traded companies encounter, these businesses have a clear advantage in volatile tariff environments.

Geopolitical Shifts and the Resilience of Promoter-Led Firms

In India, many of the leading promoter-led businesses have established vertically integrated business models that act as natural trade barriers. This is best demonstrated by the Tata Group, whose power division supports manufacturing and whose automotive division sources steel from its own mills, protecting it from fluctuations in import prices. The Adani Group’s ownership of ports, power plants, and coal mines provides natural tariff protection throughout its infrastructure empire, while Sun Pharma’s in-house API production facilitated transitions during the trade tensions between China and India.

Instead of using quarterly reporting cycles, promoter-led businesses frequently follow generational timelines. This patience is demonstrated by Bajaj Auto’s decades-long effort to enter the high-end European motorcycle markets. The business continued with its internationalization strategy despite major import duties and trade barriers in essential markets, eventually becoming a major player in the two-wheeler market on a global scale.

Strategic investments that might be unpopular with more short-term-oriented competitors are made possible by this long-term orientation. For example, due to energy transition policies and possible carbon tariffs, Adani Green Energy made significant investments in renewable infrastructure, hoping these assets would eventually become priceless. Even though these wagers are risky, if trade policies develop as expected, they can result in significant competitive advantages.

Vertical Integration as a Natural Trade Shield

However, promoter-led businesses can be vulnerable due to the same characteristics that make them strong. Some groups have suffered due to their excessive devotion to outdated, less adaptable businesses and their resistance to necessary change. Vedanta Resources was particularly negatively impacted when trade restrictions and environmental regulations started to rise sharply because it relied heavily on mining and aluminum as its main revenue streams.

Promoter-led businesses thrive when they maintain flexibility while maintaining strong governance, as demonstrated by the Tata Group’s Chandrasekaran-led balance of professional management and family control and Bajaj Auto’s ability to withstand challenging trading conditions by combining family leadership with capable executives. Those who combine the flexibility and vision of family leadership with the discipline and openness of professional management will influence their futures and India’s place in the world economy in an era of growing trade barriers and economic nationalism.",https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/smstreet/media/media_files/2025/08/16/dr-neha-gosain-2025-08-16-13-36-37.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 18:56:13.690801

Giá thành của nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững hiện vẫn đang còn khá cao.
Đây sẽ là thách thức của các hãng hàng không Việt Nam khi triển khai áp dụng nhiên liệu SAF vì có thể gián tiếp làm tăng giá vé máy bay.","Nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững là gì?

Nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững (Sustainable Aviation Fuel - SAF) là giải pháp thay thế cho nhiên liệu hóa thạch truyền thống, được sản xuất từ các nguồn tài nguyên tái tạo như dầu thực vật, mỡ thải, chất thải rắn đô thị và các nguồn sinh học khác. SAF có tiềm năng giảm đáng kể lượng khí thải carbon của ngành hàng không.

SAF có khả năng giảm tới 80% lượng phát thải CO2 so với nhiên liệu hàng không truyền thống. Đây được xem là giải pháp then chốt của ngành hàng không toàn cầu để giảm phát thải, hướng tới mục tiêu phát thải ròng bằng 0 vào năm 2050.

Theo các chuyên gia, SAF là nhiên liệu hàng không có chứa thành phần hydrocarbon tổng hợp, được chế tạo từ nhiều công nghệ sản xuất khác nhau, sử dụng nhiều nguồn nguyên liệu (dầu thải, chất thải rắn phụ phẩm nông nghiệp, các loại dầu thực vật hay sinh khối như tảo, dăm bào và các nguồn năng lượng tái tạo). Ngoài ra, các công nghệ mới đang được phát triển và có nhiều tiềm năng như sản xuất SAF từ nguồn carbon thu giữ từ khí quyển.

SAF có tính chất hóa học tương tự nhiên liệu máy bay phản lực (Jet A-1), có thể được xử lý (tồn chứa, trộn lẫn, vận chuyển, tra nạp lên máy bay) trong cùng một chuỗi cung ứng sử dụng cho nhiên liệu Jet A-1 mà không cần thay đổi cơ sở hạ tầng, động cơ máy bay.

Nghiên cứu khoa học chỉ ra, việc sử dụng nhiên liệu SAF tạo ra lượng khí thải carbon thấp hơn tới 80% so với nhiên liệu hàng không thông thường, có ý nghĩa lớn đối với việc giảm phát thải ngành hàng không, ngành vận tải gây ra gần 5% lượng khí thải CO2 toàn cầu.

Giá vé máy bay có tăng mạnh?

Tập đoàn Xăng dầu Việt Nam (Petrolimex) ngày 15.8 đã chính thức công bố sản phẩm nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững (SAF) tại Việt Nam.

Nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững không chỉ vừa mới xuất hiện tại Việt Nam sau công bố chính thức sản xuất từ Petrolimex. Năm ngoái, ngành hàng không Việt Nam ghi một dấu mốc trên thị trường quốc tế với chuyến bay đầu tiên sử dụng nhiên liệu bền vững. Đó là chuyến bay chở khách thương mại của Vietnam Airlines mang số hiệu VN660, hành trình từ Singapore đến Hà Nội. Nguồn nhiên liệu được cung cấp bởi Neste.

Thông tin lúc đó cũng đưa ra từ ngày 1.1.2025, tất cả chuyến bay của Vietnam Airlines khởi hành từ các sân bay châu Âu đều sử dụng SAF với tỷ lệ ít nhất 2%. Tỷ lệ này sẽ tăng dần lên lên 6%, 20%, 70% vào các năm 2030, 2035, 2050. Trong đó, đáng chú ý là các chuyến bay khởi hành từ nước Anh sử dụng SAF với tỷ lệ ít nhất 2% từ năm 2025 và nâng dần lên 10%, 22% tương ứng năm 2030, năm 2040.

Việc các hãng bay Việt Nam bắt đầu sử dụng nhiên liệu bền vững được đánh giá là dấu ấn của năm 2024 vì đây là một trong những hành động quan trọng nhất để thực hiện cam kết của ngành hàng không quốc tế về việc đạt mức phát thải ròng bằng 0 vào năm 2050.

Tuy nhiên, mục tiêu này đang phải đối mặt với nhiều thách thức từ chi phí sản xuất và vận hành cho đến việc cân đối giá vé máy bay sao cho phù hợp với ""túi tiền"" người dân trong bối cảnh hiện nay.

Giá thành của nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững hiện vẫn đang còn khá cao. Theo nghiên cứu, giá của SAF so với nhiên liệu hàng không truyền thống hiện nay đang cao hơn từ 2 - 3 lần, tùy thời điểm có thể cao hơn đến 5 - 6 lần. Đây sẽ là thách thức của các hãng hàng không Việt Nam khi triển khai áp dụng nhiên liệu SAF vì có thể gián tiếp làm tăng giá vé máy bay.

Cục trưởng Cục Hàng không Việt Nam, ông Uông Việt Dũng, đánh giá cao Tập đoàn Xăng dầu Việt Nam và Petrolimex Aviation đi đầu trong việc triển khai nghiên cứu, pha chế và cung ứng SAF.

Lãnh đạo Cục Hàng không Việt Nam nhấn mạnh: “Việc ra mắt sản phẩm SAF không chỉ có ý nghĩa về mặt thương mại mà còn mang ý nghĩa chiến lược lâu dài, tạo tiền đề xây dựng chuỗi cung ứng SAF bền vững trong nước; đáp ứng yêu cầu của thị trường quốc tế; khuyến khích hợp tác giữa các hãng hàng không, đơn vị cung cấp nhiên liệu, cơ quan quản lý và các tổ chức tài chính nhằm mở rộng quy mô sử dụng SAF tại Việt Nam”.

Hệ thống cung ứng, tra nạp nhiên liệu hàng không của Petrolimex Aviation đạt chứng nhận quốc tế ISCC EU và ISCC CORSIA – các tiêu chuẩn hàng đầu về tính bền vững và giảm phát thải carbon, được công nhận tại hơn 130 quốc gia.

Ông Nguyễn Văn Học, Tổng giám đốc Petrolimex Aviation chia sẻ, việc được cấp chứng nhận quốc tế uy tín nêu trên là minh chứng cho năng lực và tính chuyên nghiệp của Petrolimex trong triển khai SAF. Petrolimex Aviation sẵn sàng đồng hành cùng các đối tác trong và ngoài nước hướng tới ngành hàng không xanh, an toàn và bền vững.

Tại sự kiện, Petrolimex Aviation cũng ký kết thỏa thuận hợp tác tiêu thụ SAF với Công ty Cổ phần Hàng không Vietjet (Vietjet). Theo thỏa thuận, Petrolimex Aviation sẽ tra nạp toàn bộ 1.200m³ SAF đầu tiên được pha trộn tại Việt Nam cho các chuyến bay của Vietjet.

The question is, are these benefits enough to justify Airbus creating a modern version of the A380, complete with all the efficiency-increasing technological advantages that modern jetliners such as the Airbus A350 benefit from?
Thanks to some news from earlier this year, there may be some hope for Airbus creating the A380neo.
Previously, the last news about the potential for an A380neo hitting the market was in 2018, when there was speculation that Lufthansa would be purchasing 15 A380neo aircraft, adding perceived momentum to the project, but this turned out to be wishful thinking.
According to Clark, his plans for the A380neo would include many similarities with the modern long-range aircraft that dominate the medium-to-long-haul market today, such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350.","The Airbus A380 is a huge plane, being the only fully double-decker jet airliner in commercial service today. As the world's largest passenger airliner, it can potentially transport around 800 passengers in a single configuration over very long routes. To utilize the huge passenger-carrying potential the aircraft has, airports need to specially upgrade their gates and other infrastructure in order to accommodate the A380's massive wingspan and weight. Additionally, airlines have to pay expensive fuel costs due to the A380 being less efficient than smaller planes.

As a trade-off, the A380 is unmatched for dense hub-to-hub passenger routes, and traveling on the plane is regarded by passengers as a unique experience. The question is, are these benefits enough to justify Airbus creating a modern version of the A380, complete with all the efficiency-increasing technological advantages that modern jetliners such as the Airbus A350 benefit from? Thanks to some news from earlier this year, there may be some hope for Airbus creating the A380neo.

Emirates Will Buy The A380neo If It's Built

The news on this subject is that, in January this year, Emirates president Sir Tim Clark communicated his interest in the project, recounting a conversation between himself and Airbus executives about the possibility of the A380neo project being undertaken, according to Executive Traveller. A modern version of the A380 would be able to take advantage of the latest technology, giving the new A380neo a better chance of success than its predecessor. Clark said the following to the publication during a trip to Melbourne on an A380:

“I still have a design in front of Airbus as to how they could build a new one which would be 25% cheaper to run, far more fuel-efficient than this one. They said, ‘Well if you give us €20 billion, we’ll do it for you!’”

Clark recounted his reply that it was up to Airbus to make that large investment, but also committed to buying the aircraft if they do: “but if you build them, we’ll buy them.” Clark’s blueprint for the A380neo would deliver at least a 20-25% reduction in fuel, according to him, and he believes this would make all the difference in making the large, four-engined double-decker jet viable in today's commercial aviation market.

Previously, the last news about the potential for an A380neo hitting the market was in 2018, when there was speculation that Lufthansa would be purchasing 15 A380neo aircraft, adding perceived momentum to the project, but this turned out to be wishful thinking. A couple of years later, COVID and lockdowns caused a contraction of the aviation market, which has since returned to normal. In a struggle to meet quickly rising demand, airlines have had to start looking for solutions.

What Changes Would An A380neo Have?

According to Clark, his plans for the A380neo would include many similarities with the modern long-range aircraft that dominate the medium-to-long-haul market today, such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350. He specified some of these in the Executive Traveller article:

“We now know a lot more about the A380 than we did when it was built. The (tail) fin is too large, the wings need to be changed… all of this is in the later generation of aircraft.”

The extensive use of carbon fiber composites was also specified, as both the 787 and A350 feature at least 50% composites in the fuselage and wings. Typically, composites have a greater strength-to-weight ratio compared to typical aluminum alloys, significantly improving lightness and fuel-efficiency. Since the A380 has such expansively wide wings, its usability could also be increased by featuring similar folding wingtips to the Boeing 777X, meaning it could utilize normal airport gates, but this was not one of Clark's suggestions as far as is known.

The largest impact in terms of achieving better fuel-efficiency would be through the use of modern high-bypass turbofan engines, and Clark is hopeful that four Rolls-Royce UltraFan engines, which are currently being developed by Rolls-Royce, may fit the bill.

“If it’s ever allowed to get its head above the water level, this is a revolution in power. It’s a much bigger fan requiring less fuel to drive it, with enormous thrust capabilities (so) you’ve got to get something like that on the A380.”

With a fan diameter of 140 inches, the UltraFan is set to be the biggest and most efficient turbofan engine ever. Expected to begin air and ground testing by 2030, the engine will be capable of using 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel from day one, and Rolls-Royce is even exploring options for hybrid-electric and hydrogen power solutions.

The A380neo Would Be Well-Loved

Passengers would certainly welcome the return of the A380, which is regarded as being the best for its premium passenger experience, featuring private first-class suites equipped with showers and a cocktail bar at the rear of the upper deck. For airlines, the A380 is desirable for its ability to transport many customers, and as a result, airlines such as Qantas have started bringing their A380's out of retirement, according to AirwaysMag.

The A380 is also famous in Hollywood, having been the inspiration for the fictional double-decker where the 2005 movie, Flightplan, takes place. However, in the film, some of the internal space, such as in avionics, is larger for effect. In a thread, Simple Flying asked whether Airbus should build the A380neo, and received a good number of responses, many making the case for viability in today's market:

""A combination of slot restrictions, population growth and the obvious indicators that some airlines CAN make quad retest work, a VLA will be needed soon. A relaunched NEO A380 with aerodynamic improvements would be very welcome.""

""Yes, for sure. With composites, better and more fuel efficient engines it's therefore a no brainer. The current fact of crowded skies and airports will dictate planes having nowhere to land. Fewer, larger planes are the future.""

There were also people of the opinion that such a large plane in this day and age would be impractical, thanks to only being able to use a limited number of airstrips and gates, favoring aircraft that were able to use more locations instead:

""Put simply, there isn’t enough infrastructure to support a new generation of A380 aircraft. The A380 is already restricted to larger airports, and with more absurdly large aircraft in the ecosystem, there’s just no more room! Don’t get me wrong, the A380 is an incredible feat of human engineering, but it’s replacement by more versatile aircraft like the B787 is inevitable. Air France for example, has retired it’s A380 fleet even though they were only 15 years old.""

Are Smaller Aircraft The Future?

It is a good observation that the commercial aviation market has recently been dominated by much smaller widebody aircraft than the A380. Using the most recent Airbus A350-900ULR variant as an example, the aircraft operates the longest flights in the world, Singapore Airlines Flights 23 and 24 from Singapore to New York JFK, as of 2022.

Range is the reason why aircraft such as the A350 have dominated, as it gives airlines the freedom to fly just about any route in the world, while still carrying an impressive 315 people in two-class seating per flight, or 440 as a maximum. For most airlines' purposes, this satisfies the passenger demand for a route, thus it ends up being better value to fly several A350's rather than one A380 flight. This also gives the customer more options for connections and destinations.

However, this may not be the case forever, and if demand continues to grow, the viable niche for ultra-jumbo jetliners will only get larger. In fact, Airbus celebrated the A380's birthday in April, as it had been 20 years since its maiden flight. Since its entry into commercial service, the A380 has flown over 800,000 flights and carried more than 300 million passengers, according to Airbus, and the manufacturer intends to continue supporting the model.

The Idea Has Merit Overall

Originally, Airbus had planned to release more variants of the A380 aside from the -800, the base model. A freight version, the A380F, was canceled in favor of focusing on the -800, and a stretched version, the -900, which would have seated about 656 passengers, or up to 960 passengers in an all-economy configuration, was also canceled. As Clark suspects, “at least a 20-25% reduction in fuel” would be a game-changer for a modern version of the A380, offsetting the main downside of the huge type.

The other large downside, the usability of the plane at airports, could also be easily solved by using folding wings. Thanks to procedures that were polished by manufacturing rival, Boeing and its 777X, Airbus has a test case for a folding-wing commercial aircraft, greatly increasing the potential number of airports that an A380neo could utilize.

Though many believe that this project will never get off the ground, there certainly does exist a niche for the huge luxurious double-decker, particularly if modern fuel-saving measures are used in its design. Emirates has not given up funds to get the project off the ground as yet, but a commitment to buy is very valuable for the manufacturer. It will also be interesting to see whether Airbus gets involved with the UltraFan project with a view to developing another huge quad-jet in the future.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/neoupdated.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 12:56:17.729472

Associated British Foods (ABF), the owner of Vivergo, confirmed on Friday that the plant will shut its doors within weeks.
Sharon Graham, the general secretary, said: “This is a short-sighted decision that totally disregards the benefits the domestic bioethanol sector will bring to jobs and energy security.
The closure of the Vivergo plant will also represent a fresh blow to thousands of British farmers who supply grain to the site.
The UK imports around 45 per cent of its CO2 and sources have previously warned of a supply crisis without a domestic bioethanol industry if foreign sources were disrupted.","Britain’s largest bioethanol plant will close after Sir Keir Starmer refused to step in and save the industry.

On Friday, the Government announced it would not give any funding to the Vivergo Fuels business in Hull, which is losing £3m a month.

Around 150 workers are expected to lose their jobs at the factory, which is expected to close by Sept 13 and is one of only two domestic bioethanol production sites.

Associated British Foods (ABF), the owner of Vivergo, confirmed on Friday that the plant will shut its doors within weeks.

The industry had hoped for a bailout after Sir Keir Starmer’s trade deal with Donald Trump, which will allow the US to supply Britain with 1.4bn litres of duty-free ethanol.

But on Friday afternoon, a government spokesman said: “This Government will always take decisions in the national interest.

“That’s why we negotiated a landmark deal with the US which protected hundreds of thousands of jobs in sectors like auto and aerospace.”

It said it had worked to understand the challenges faced by both Vivergo and the Ensus bioethanol plant in Redcar on Teesside, which has also been refused a bailout.

The spokesman said the Government would not offer any direct funding “as it would not provide value for the taxpayer or solve the long-term problems the industry faces”.

They continued: “We recognise this is a difficult time for the workers and their families and we will work with trade unions, local partners and the companies to support them through this process.

“We also continue to work up proposals that ensure the resilience of our CO2 supply in the long term in consultation with the sector.”

Unite, Labour’s biggest trade union backer, heavily criticised the Government for refusing to bail out the bioethanol industry.

Sharon Graham, the general secretary, said: “This is a short-sighted decision that totally disregards the benefits the domestic bioethanol sector will bring to jobs and energy security.

“Once again, the Government’s total lack of a plan to support oil and gas workers as the industry transitions is glaring.”

The union noted that bioethanol was a key component of sustainable aviation fuel, which is expected to be in huge demand in the coming years.

The closure of the Vivergo plant will also represent a fresh blow to thousands of British farmers who supply grain to the site.

A record number of farms are already closing for good after Rachel Reeves’s changes to agricultural property relief made the future of thousands of rural businesses unviable.

As well as the collapse of a major domestic market, the closure will risk pushing previously profitable farms into making a loss.

An ABF spokesman said: “It is deeply regrettable that the Government has chosen not to support a key national asset.

“We have been fighting for months to keep this plant open. We initiated and led talks with the Government in good faith.

“We presented a clear plan to restore Vivergo to profitability within two years under policy levers already aligned with the Government’s own green industrial strategy.”

ABF accused the Government of having “thrown away billions in potential growth” and the chance to lead the world in bioethanol.

“The loss of Vivergo will be felt most acutely by our dedicated workforce and their families and by the thousands whose livelihoods depend on our supply chain, from farmers to hauliers and engineers.”

During its talks with Jonathan Reynolds, the Business Secretary, ABF had demanded ministers step in to cover “short-term funding of Vivergo’s losses” as well as striking a longer-term deal to put its plant on a profitable footing again.

Investment from Vivergo is thought to support around 1,220 farming jobs across the north-east of England.

The UK imports around 45 per cent of its CO2 and sources have previously warned of a supply crisis without a domestic bioethanol industry if foreign sources were disrupted.

In June, The Telegraph revealed a leaked memo by industry leaders that said the bioethanol sector was a “critical component” of British food security and energy resilience.

The memo warned: “The closure of Vivergo would damage farm incomes, increase import dependency and undermine the Government’s strategic goals across multiple departments.”",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/briefs/2025/08/15/TELEMMGLPICT000430122367_17552674514250_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqOFeYxM9hegFHu6FKJsELIu9hg0Y37QvHYjcZPVg1zsA.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-08-16 11:56:29.868625

Veralto (VLTO) is in a state of technical neutrality, with mixed signals from key indicators suggesting a wait-and-see approach for now. The recent price trend is positive (0.30%), and market expectations are leaning optimistic, though with some divergence in analyst ratings.

News Highlights

Here are the key news stories that may affect the broader market environment:

Ethanol-to-SAF Technology Breakthrough: A new report highlights advancements in converting ethanol to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which could open new commercial opportunities for energy and biochemical companies. While not directly related to Veralto, this reflects growing interest in sustainable technologies that Veralto could potentially benefit from.

Global Aid Supply Issues: Multiple reports highlighted looting of aid supplies in Gaza and related humanitarian concerns. While not directly affecting Veralto, the geopolitical instability could create broader market uncertainty, which investors should watch closely.

China Visa Policy Shift: U.S. officials announced a policy to revoke visas for some Chinese students and researchers linked to the CCP or critical fields. This could affect the global flow of talent and research collaboration, potentially influencing technology and biotech sectors.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Veralto’s analyst consensus shows a relatively optimistic outlook. The simple average rating is 4.00, while the performance-weighted rating is 4.75. These scores suggest that while there is general optimism, there is also dispersion in the ratings. Specifically, Stifel’s Nathan Jones has shown the strongest historical performance (62.5% win rate, 1.05% average return), with two recent “Strong Buy” ratings.

Despite some conflicting signals, the current price rise aligns with the market’s weighted expectations, indicating that analysts and market sentiment are broadly in sync.

Key Fundamental Factors

ROE (Return on Equity): 8.34% - Internal diagnostic score: 6.58

ROA (Return on Assets): 3.10% - Internal diagnostic score: 6.58

Net Income to Revenue: 41.28% - Internal diagnostic score: 6.58

Total Profit (YoY growth): 10.38% - Internal diagnostic score: 6.58

Net Profit Attributable to Parent Company Shareholders (YoY growth): 15.50% - Internal diagnostic score: 6.58

Money-Flow Trends

Veralto is seeing mixed money-flow patterns. While small retail investors are showing a positive trend (50.8% inflow ratio), the larger institutional blocks are trending negatively (48.3% inflow ratio for extra-large funds). The fund-flow score is 7.64, indicating a generally positive score, but with caution required as large and extra-large flows are trending downward. This suggests that big money is cautious, while retail investors remain optimistic.

Key Technical Signals

Veralto’s technical score is 5.85, placing it in a zone of technical neutrality. Despite having more bullish than bearish indicators (3 to 1), the conflicting signals—such as the overbought RSI and strong Hanging Man pattern—suggest that the market is in a volatile phase without a clear trend.

Indicator Breakdown

Hanging Man: Score: 8.03 – A strong bullish signal, historically resulting in a 3.26% average return and 100% win rate.

Bearish Engulfing: Score: 7.27 – Suggests a potential downturn, with a 70% win rate but only a -0.12% average return.

WR Overbought: Score: 7.1 – A neutral rise signal with a 61.9% win rate.

RSI Overbought: Score: 1.0 – A strong bearish signal with only a 25% win rate and -0.45% average return.

Recent Chart Patterns

August 13: WR Overbought, RSI Overbought, and Hanging Man all triggered – a mixed bag of bearish and bullish signals.

August 12: WR Overbought again appears, reinforcing a potential overbought condition.

August 11: Bearish Engulfing pattern appears, suggesting downward pressure.

However, with the airline’s business model focusing on a youthful fleet and attempting to renew, there has been much interest in the A380neo.

But, without the model releasing and comments in recent years, does interest in this new engine option exist before this period, and if so, what did it entail?

What Is The A380neo?

Details of a prospective A380neo will always remain scarce, this is driven by the reality that the aircraft has not been launched, and interest in it has always been kept on the down low, primarily only from Emirates.

But as the three letters on the end of the product suggest, neo, this model would incorporate new engines, like what has been seen with the A320 and A330 families in recent times.

Equipping new engines to an existing platform with other aeronautical improvements can represent a more cost-effective upgrade for an existing platform that may at times lack the efficiency customers require.

If executed, fuel efficiency would’ve improved, and operating costs for the superjumbo would’ve lowered. While not reducing to a level that would’ve resulted in mass adoption, it would’ve at least addressed two of the concerns that prevented the jet from thriving.

While new engines would’ve been the selling point, other improvements would’ve been a priority to bring the model up to speed with newer planes and ensure it would fly for some time longer.

A Love For The A380

Emirates remains the largest operator of the A380-800, having ordered well over 100 units and, at its peak, flying over 120 units, far exceeding any other airline’s commitment to the series.

The airline built its brand around this aircraft, leveraging its high capacity and passenger appeal to help grow its network and Dubai, its home, into a powerhouse for transit travel.

As a result, and with so many Airbus A380’s in its fleet, it isn’t hard to see why there has been so much interest in a possible A380neo, for no adequate replacement exists for the Dubai-based carrier.

Emirates has been forced to look elsewhere, away from the A380 for its future fleet. This has included a heavier reliance on twin-engine aircraft such as the 777X moving forward.

Despite the cost advantages these planes will have on their long-haul network, they still will struggle to complete the job of the A380 because of their smaller stature, but with no dedicated replacement, there must be

Emirates’ Interest In The 2010s

Emirates’ interest in a prospective Airbus A380neo, while existing only in the last few years, far predates this timeframe, with interest also emerging in 2014.

The Dubai-based carrier, at the time led by President Tim Clark, spoke with the Financial Times about the proposition of a new A380 model launching sometime in the future.

At this point, it’s key to remember the A380 was still active, the plane was also still being delivered, and the planemaker had yet to see what would unfold with the program that would ultimately lead to its demise.

Emirates, therefore, was one of the only, if not the only, publicly vocal customers expressing interest in the possibility of a new model being launched, being already the largest operator of the A380-800 and at this point having many more on order.

In the interview, Clark reaffirmed his stance in 2014 that they were interested in the launch of an A380neo, and if the project moved forward, they would buy it in numbers, considering acquiring some 60 to 80 units.

Airbus Studied The Launch

In recent years, discussion from all parties surrounding an A380neo has cooled, driven by airlines shifting away from quad-engined jets more than ever.

Additionally, in the last 11 years since the planemaker first saw significant interest emerge from Emirates, much has occurred with the A380 program, the jet seeing its production life come to an end.

The end of the production life of the A380-800 model didn’t come without attempts to push the jet into markets and extend the production life; however, they ultimately failed, and when Emirates slashed its commitments, the decision to end the superjumbo was confirmed.

Despite this, in 2014, the Chief Commercial Officer at the time, John Leahy, told Aviation Week that internal studies were already underway to help determine whether a future existed for a next-generation A380 release.

With much of the interest in the jet centred around the adoption of new engines and other minor improvements, if released, the planemaker needed to determine whether there would be enough demand to warrant the investment, and what the return would look like.

These studies at the time would’ve seen an estimated six-year process before the jet would have formally launched, in time for the commencement of the new decade, and with hindsight, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which ironically spelled the end of the series.

No Release

Despite Airbus moving ahead with internal studies and conducting its due diligence, a decision to proceed with the launch of an A380neo was ultimately not made.

Airbus would reveal the development study of the A380plus towards the backend of the 2010s in the hopes of showing what possible innovation would give to customers, but this failed.

Emirates, the only airline customer expressing interest in a new model, firmly believed the A380neo, a new engine option, would be the answer, not the plus model. Therefore, when the A380plus was revealed, it unsurprisingly showed little to no interest.

Now, even with the airline’s president, Clark, resurfacing discussions around a re-engine every handful of months, production has closed on the A380-800, and priorities lie elsewhere.

Airbus, alongside engine makers, are busy studying the new era of commercial aircraft travel, and a prospective A380neo would further derail plans and fundamentally take away space and resources from these studies, only to please the likely one interested customer.

Ultimately, Emirates’ long-standing interest did prompt some internal studies in the mid-2010s from the planemaker, but with no action and production ending on the A380, the A380neo’s fate had all but been sealed.",https://djsaviation.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Emirates-Airbus-A380-800-parked-1.webp,N,,2025-08-16 11:56:41.297398

A government spokesperson said on Friday, “We have taken the difficult decision not to offer direct funding as it would not provide value for taxpayers or solve the industry’s long-term problems.”

Under the agreement signed by former Prime Minister Theresa May, the UK cut its 19% tariffs on U.S. ethanol to zero within a quota of 1.4 billion litres — equal to the size of the entire British ethanol market.

The UK has two main bioethanol plants, Associated British Foods’ Vivergo facility and Ensus, owned by Germany’s Südzucker Group, both located in northern England. Together, they make up almost all of the country’s production capacity.

AB Foods warned in June it would shut the Vivergo plant by September without government support. Ensus has also said its plant is at risk of closure.

A spokesperson for AB Foods said it was “deeply regrettable that the government has chosen not to support a key national asset.” Ensus did not immediately comment.

Industry groups say the trade deal, combined with existing rules that give U.S. producers an edge, has made operations unviable. The sector directly supports thousands of jobs in the UK.

Petrolimex Aviation đã đạt ra mục tiêu phủ xanh bầu trời Việt Nam sẽ không chỉ là một khẩu hiệu truyền thông.
Không dừng lại ở việc giảm phát thải, đó còn là khát vọng vươn tầm vị thế Việt Nam trên bản đồ hàng không thế giới.","Chiến lược xanh và cam kết Net Zero 2050

Thực hiện cam kết của Việt Nam tại Hội nghị COP26 về phát thải ròng bằng 0 vào năm 2050, ngành hàng không Việt Nam đã đặt ra yêu cầu phải cắt giảm phát thải carbon và metan của ngành hàng không Việt Nam thông qua việc chuyển đổi năng lượng, đặc biệt là chuyển đổi từ nhiên liệu hoá thạch sang nhiên liệu bền vững Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Việc thực hiện cam kết tại Hội nghị COP26 cũng phù hợp với chiến lược phát triển năng lượng xanh, sạch, thân thiện với môi trường của Tập đoàn Xăng dầu Việt Nam.

Để thực hiện chủ trương này, SAF được xem là giải pháp khả thi nhất hiện nay khi các công nghệ như máy bay điện, hoặc hydro còn ở giai đoạn thử nghiệm.

Petrolimex Aviation đã triển khai nhập khẩu, kiểm soát chất lượng, lưu trữ và xuất bán SAF theo đúng các quy định tại tiêu chuẩn ASTM D7566, DEF STAN 91-091 và AFQRJOS Checklist phiên bản hiện hành; các tiêu chuẩn của Hiệp hội Vận tải Hàng không Quốc tế (IATA), Tổ chức kiểm tra chung (JIG) và Bộ Giao thông vận tải (nay là Bộ Xây dựng).

Đánh dấu cho chiến lược “xanh hóa” này là sự kiện Petrolimex Aviation thực hiện thành công việc tra nạp nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững - Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) cho 2 chuyến bay số hiệu VJ081 và VJ860 của Hãng hàng không Vietjet (Vietjet Air) xuất phát từ TP Hồ Chí Minh (Việt Nam) đi Melbourne (Australia) và Incheon (Hàn Quốc) ngày 17/10/2024.

Đây là hành động cụ thể, đặt nền móng cho việc hình thành chuỗi cung ứng SAF tại Việt Nam.

Sự kiện này cũng đánh dấu lần đầu tiên SAF được sử dụng cho các chuyến bay khởi hành từ Việt Nam, thể hiện nỗ lực, quyết tâm của Petrolimex Aviation trong việc phát triển sản phẩm xanh - sạch, sẵn sàng cung cấp SAF đáp ứng nhu cầu của các hãng hàng không trong nước và quốc tế.

Không dừng lại ở đó, ngày 15/8, Petrolimex Aviation tiếp tục có bước tiến chiến lược, đó là ký kết thỏa thuận cung cấp 1.200 m³ (1.200.000 lít) SAF đầu tiên được pha trộn tại Việt Nam cho các chuyến bay nội địa của Vietjet, đồng thời hợp tác với AEG FUEL nhằm hỗ trợ thương mại hóa SAF tại Việt Nam cho các hãng hàng không quốc tế trong tương lai.

Đây là dấu mốc mở ra khả năng sản xuất - pha trộn - phân phối SAF ngay trong nước, giảm phụ thuộc nhập khẩu và thúc đẩy ngành hàng không Việt Nam tiến gần hơn đến mục tiêu giảm phát thải ròng.

Nói về ý nghĩa của sự kiện này, ông Uông Việt Dũng - Cục trưởng Cục Hàng không Việt Nam cho biết, việc ra mắt sản phẩm SAF không chỉ có ý nghĩa về mặt thương mại, mà còn mang ý nghĩa chiến lược lâu dài, tạo tiền đề xây dựng chuỗi cung ứng SAF bền vững trong nước; góp phần đáp ứng các yêu cầu bắt buộc của thị trường quốc tế, đặc biệt là RefuelEU Aviation của Liên minh châu Âu và CORSIA của ICAO; khuyến khích hợp tác giữa các hãng hàng không, đơn vị cung cấp nhiên liệu, cơ quan quản lý và các tổ chức tài chính nhằm mở rộng quy mô sử dụng SAF tại Việt Nam.

Còn ông Phạm Văn Thanh - Chủ tịch Hội đồng quản trị Tập đoàn Xăng dầu Việt Nam thì cho rằng, ngoài việc công bố sản phẩm SAF, Công ty CP Nhiên liệu bay Petrolimex Aviation sẽ ký kết các biên bản ghi nhớ hợp tác chiến lược với hai đối tác lớn là Vietjet Air và AEG (Associated Energy Group).

“Những thỏa thuận này khẳng định quyết tâm của Petrolimex trong việc đóng góp thiết thực vào việc giảm phát thải và nâng cao vị thế quốc gia trên bản đồ năng lượng xanh toàn cầu”, ông Thanh nói.

Tổng giám đốc Petrolimex Aviation Nguyễn Văn Học cho biết, trong quá trình triển khai, Petrolimex Aviation đã nhận được sự hỗ trợ quý báu của các cơ quan quản lý nhà nước như: Cục Hàng không Việt Nam, Cục Quản lý và Phát triển Thị trường trong nước - Bộ Công thương, Cục Hải quan trong việc cấp phép, hoàn thiện tiêu chuẩn và chính sách, tạo điều kiện thuận lợi cho công tác triển khai sản phẩm SAF.

Nói về sự hợp tác giữa Công ty Petrolimex Aviation (PA) và Công ty cổ phần Hàng không Vietjet (VJC) và Công ty AEG Fuels, Tổng giám đốc Nguyễn Văn Học cho biết, VJC và PA đã cùng đồng hành trong nhiều năm qua, từ giai đoạn hình thành, phát triển cho đến vượt qua thử thách của đại dịch, không chỉ trên phương diện kinh doanh, mà còn ở mục tiêu chung là phát triển bền vững của ngành hàng không Việt Nam.

“Tháng 10/2024, PA và VJC hai bên đã ghi dấu mốc lịch sử khi thực hiện 2 chuyến bay sử dụng SAF đầu tiên tại Việt Nam do PA tra nạp.

Tiếp nối thành công đó, ngày 15/8, Công ty PA và Công ty CP Hàng không Vietjet sẽ triển khai tra nạp toàn bộ 1.200.000 lít SAF đầu tiên được pha trộn tại Việt Nam cho các chuyến bay nội địa của Vietjet - tương đương lượng nhiên liệu tra nạp cho 200 chuyến, sẽ bay từ sân bay Tân Sơn Nhất tới khắp các tỉnh thành Việt Nam, điều này sẽ góp phần “xanh hóa” bầu trời.

Đây là hành động cụ thể biến cam kết thành hiện thực, góp phần chắp cánh cho những chuyến bay xanh, an toàn và bền vững”, ông Học nói.

Với đối với đối tác AEG FUELS, đại diện PA cho biết, đây cũng là đối tác thương mại lâu năm của PA tại thị trường Việt Nam và Quốc tế từ năm 2011 đến này. “Với với kinh nghiệm triển khai SAF và mạng lưới khách hàng là các các hãng hàng không toàn cầu, PA tin tưởng rằng AEG FUELS sẽ giúp kết nối thị trường Việt Nam với xu thế sử dụng SAF của thế giới, mở ra những cơ hội hợp tác sâu rộng trong tương lai”, ông Học chia sẻ.

Có thể nói, hai mốc sự kiện trên là minh chứng rõ ràng cho lộ trình hành động mà Petrolimex Aviation đã và đang triển khai. Phát triển bền vững nhưng dám gánh vác trên vai trách nhiệm quốc gia trước cộng đồng quốc tế.

Khát vọng phủ xanh bầu trời Việt của Petrolimex Aviation

Trong bối cảnh hiện nay, Việt Nam đang khẩn trương xây dựng kế hoạch quốc gia về sản xuất SAF và chuẩn bị tham gia Chương trình bù đắp và giảm thiểu carbon cho hàng không quốc tế (CORSIA) của ICAO.

Phó Thủ tướng Chính phủ Trần Hồng Hà cũng đã chỉ đạo Cục Hàng không Việt Nam chuẩn bị đề xuất chi tiết, đồng thời yêu cầu các nhà sản xuất và lọc dầu trong nước vạch ra kế hoạch cụ thể cho sản xuất SAF.

Bộ Tài chính và Bộ Ngoại giao cũng được giao nhiệm vụ xem xét các lựa chọn áp phí đối với các chuyến bay quốc tế khởi hành từ Việt Nam, cũng như các ưu đãi thuế và hỗ trợ tài chính để thúc đẩy sản xuất SAF trong nước.

Ngay cả các nhà sản xuất máy bay như Airbus cũng cam kết các dòng máy bay của họ, như A330neo và A321neo, hiện có thể vận hành với tối đa 50% SAF, với mục tiêu tăng lên 100% khả năng sử dụng SAF vào năm 2030.

Tuy nhiên, hiện chi phí sản xuất SAF cao hơn nhiên liệu truyền thống và nguồn cung toàn cầu còn hạn chế dù thị trường đang tăng trưởng nhanh.

Theo dự báo của ResourceWise, giá trị thị trường SAF có thể đạt 3,92 tỷ USD vào năm 2028, điều này mở ra cơ hội lớn cho những doanh nghiệp tiên phong. Trong đó có sự góp mặt từ những ngày đầu của Petrolimex Aviation.

Từ nhận thức sâu sắc rằng, mỗi chuyến bay sẽ không chỉ mang sứ mệnh vận chuyển hành khách, hàng hóa..., mà còn mang theo trách nhiệm phủ xanh bầu trời và bảo vệ một tương lai xanh cho các thế hệ mai sau.

Petrolimex Aviation đã đạt ra mục tiêu phủ xanh bầu trời Việt Nam sẽ không chỉ là một khẩu hiệu truyền thông.

Petrolimex Aviation đặt mục tiêu đến năm 2050 sẽ đồng hành cùng ngành hàng không Việt Nam loại bỏ hoàn toàn phát thải ròng CO₂, thông qua việc: Tăng tỷ trọng SAF trong tổng lượng nhiên liệu cung ứng hàng năm, tiến tới thương mại hóa và sử dụng rộng rãi trên cả các đường bay quốc tế và nội địa; Phát triển chuỗi cung ứng SAF nội địa - từ nghiên cứu nguyên liệu tái tạo, hợp tác sản xuất - pha trộn, đến hệ thống phân phối và tra nạp đồng bộ tại các sân bay lớn; Hợp tác toàn cầu với các hãng hàng không, nhà sản xuất và tổ chức quốc tế nhằm cập nhật công nghệ, giảm chi phí sản xuất SAF và mở rộng quy mô ứng dụng.

Không dừng lại ở việc giảm phát thải, đó còn là khát vọng vươn tầm vị thế Việt Nam trên bản đồ hàng không thế giới. Biến Việt Nam thành trung tâm cung cấp nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững trong khu vực, nơi mà mỗi chuyến bay cất cánh từ mảnh đất hình chữ S sẽ mang theo thông điệp mạnh mẽ: “Việt Nam cam kết và hành động vì một hành tinh xanh”.",https://osky.1cdn.vn/thumbs/1200x630/2025/08/16/z6911107863176_073bcff19babefae910720ce952a5e09.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 11:57:03.444121

It’s taken the better part of four decades, but Airbus has finally caught up: The A320 series is poised to overtake its US competitor as the most-delivered commercial airliner in history, according to aviation consultancy Cirium. As of early August, Airbus had winnowed the gap to just 20 units, with 12,155 lifetime A320-family shipments, according to the data. That difference is likely to disappear as soon as next month.

“Did anyone back then expect it could become number one – and on such high production volumes?” Max Kingsley-Jones, head of advisory at Cirium Ascend, wrote of the A320 in a recent social-media post. “I certainly didn’t, and nor probably did Airbus.”

The A320’s success mirrors the European planemaker’s decades-long rise from fledgling planemaker to serious contender, and finally Boeing’s better. By the early 2000s, annual deliveries of the A320 and its derivatives had surpassed the 737 family; total orders eclipsed the Boeing jet in 2019. But the 737 stubbornly remained the most-delivered commercial aircraft of all time.

At the outset, Airbus faced an uphill battle. The European planemaker, an assemblage of aerospace manufacturers formed in 1970 with backing from European governments, didn’t yet offer a full aircraft lineup. Infighting hindered everything from product planning to manufacturing, and leadership decisions had to finely balance French and German commercial and political interests.

Yet it was clear even then that Airbus needed a presence in the narrowbody segment to firmly establish itself as Boeing’s top rival. Those aircraft are by far the most widely flown category in commercial aviation, typically connecting city pairs on shorter routes.

Higher fuel costs and the deregulation of the US aviation industry in the late 1970s had given the European planemaker an opening with American airline executives, who clamored for an all-new single-aisle, according to a history of Airbus written by journalist Nicola Clark.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QBupYqDM3pYWl.BtZ9PuTw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_holding_pen_162/374a68d59c5529d1fcddf3836f5d2c86,N,,2025-08-16 11:57:10.259776

This structural realignment, accelerated by Boeing's post-737 MAX challenges and Airbus's strategic agility, has profound implications for equity investors. To assess the long-term competitive advantages of Airbus and the risks Boeing faces, we must dissect their financial performance, production capabilities, and sustainability initiatives.

Market Share and Delivery Momentum: Airbus's Unstoppable Edge

Airbus has delivered more aircraft than Boeing for five consecutive years, a trend that intensified in 2025. By July 2025, Airbus had delivered 373 commercial aircraft, compared to Boeing's 328. The A320neo family, which accounts for 88.9% of Airbus's backlog, remains the cornerstone of its success. With a production rate of 54 A320neos in July 2025 alone, Airbus is on track to surpass its 2025 target of 820 deliveries. In contrast, Boeing's 737 MAX program, while stabilizing at 38 units per month, struggles to match Airbus's narrowbody output.

The disparity in delivery performance is compounded by Airbus's stronger backlog. As of July 2025, Airbus's 8,678-aircraft backlog represents 10.6 years of production, with 88.9% in high-demand narrowbodies. Boeing's 6,563-aircraft backlog, while robust, is skewed toward 737 MAXs (74.4%) and widebodies like the 787, which face production bottlenecks. Analysts project Airbus to maintain a 50% market share in 2025, up from 43% in 2023, while Boeing's share languishes at 45%.

Financial Resilience: Airbus's Profitability vs. Boeing's Debt Woes

Airbus's financial health starkly contrasts with Boeing's precarious position. In 2025, Airbus reported a net profit of €4.2 billion, driven by efficient production and strong order momentum. Its revenue of $75 billion outpaced Boeing's $66.5 billion, despite a smaller workforce. Airbus's net debt of €5.4 billion and positive free cash flow position it to fund R&D and expand production.

Boeing, however, posted a net loss of $11.8 billion in 2025, exacerbated by $38 billion in net debt and negative equity. While its 737 MAX program has stabilized, the company's debt-to-equity ratio of 49% (vs. Airbus's 9%) raises concerns about long-term viability.

R&D and Sustainability: Airbus's Innovation Edge

Airbus's $3.6 billion R&D investment in 2025 underscores its focus on next-generation technologies. The company is pioneering hydrogen-powered aircraft, folding-wing designs, and lightweight materials to reduce fuel burn by 25% in future models. Its commitment to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) aligns with global decarbonization goals, positioning it as a leader in the $599 billion aviation fuel market by 2031.

Boeing's R&D spending of $3.1 billion is concentrated on stabilizing existing models, particularly the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner. While the 787's production rate has increased to seven units per month, its 777X program remains delayed until 2026. Boeing's sustainability efforts, though promising (e.g., B787-9's 2.31 L/100km per passenger fuel efficiency), are constrained by financial pressures.

Strategic Implications for Investors

For equity investors, Airbus's structural advantages—superior delivery performance, stronger profitability, and forward-looking R&D—make it a compelling long-term bet. Its ability to secure 203 orders in June 2025 (vs. Boeing's 116) highlights its market appeal, particularly in Asia-Pacific, where demand for narrowbodies is surging.

Boeing's recovery hinges on resolving production bottlenecks, reducing debt, and regaining regulatory trust. While its 737 MAX backlog and 787 growth potential offer upside, the risks of operational instability and regulatory scrutiny remain high. Investors should prioritize Airbus for its resilience and scalability but monitor Boeing's progress in stabilizing its core programs.

Conclusion: A New Era in Aerospace

The Airbus-Boeing rivalry has entered a new chapter, with Airbus's dominance reshaping the industry. For investors, this shift underscores the importance of aligning with companies that can scale production, innovate sustainably, and navigate regulatory landscapes. Airbus's trajectory suggests a sustained lead in the post-737 MAX era, while Boeing's future remains contingent on its ability to execute a complex turnaround. As the aerospace sector evolves, equity allocations should reflect these structural realities.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-16 16:56:32.511330

India marked its 79th Independence Day with tricolours flying high, patriotic songs, and the national anthem echoing across the country. But beneath the celebrations lies a bitter truth — while the government basks in the glory of freedom, workers, farmers, and their unions are still forced to fight for their basic rights.

Just a month ago, on July 9, lakhs of workers participated in a one-day nationwide general strike. The question is unavoidable: why, after nearly eight decades of independence, do we still have to take to the streets for justice?

Let history not be forgotten. During the freedom struggle, it was the working class and trade unions — particularly the AITUC — that stood shoulder to shoulder with the national movement, winning landmark rights like the Trade Union Act of 1926 even under colonial rule. After independence, workers were the backbone of nation-building — expanding railways, setting up defence industries, driving irrigation projects, building public sector enterprises, and ensuring the nationalisation of banks and insurance.

But over the last two decades, successive governments have betrayed this legacy. Under the banner of “ease of doing business” and corporate-friendly reforms, permanent jobs have been killed off, replaced with insecure contract and fixed-term work. Public sector jewels are being sold off. Even core sectors — defence, education, healthcare, electricity, banking, insurance — are not spared. Social security is being shredded. In today’s India, job security is a relic, and dignity of labour is under assault.

Unemployment and underemployment plague our youth. In the Central Government alone, over 15 lakh posts lie vacant; in PSUs and banks, another 5–10 lakh. Reservation for marginalised communities exists only in the public sector — and yet, this very sector is being dismantled. Bank employees fight privatisation, insurance workers fight for wage revision, municipal conservancy workers fight for regularisation, ordnance factory employees fight corporatisation, and government staff demand the restoration of the Old Pension Scheme.

Worse still, the government refuses to talk. The Indian Labour Conference — the country’s highest tripartite forum — has not been convened. The Joint Consultative Machinery for government employees is paralysed. This is not governance; this is contempt.

India today is an economic power, but let us be clear: it is the sweat of its workers and farmers that made this possible. A country that ignores them is not on the road to development — it is on the road to injustice. As we approach the 80th year of independence, the government must shed its arrogance, return to dialogue, and respect the principles of socialism and secularism enshrined in our Constitution.

Freedom without justice for workers is not true freedom, he concludes.",https://indianpsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/north-South-Block.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 11:57:23.770517

Experts note that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) shares similar chemical properties with conventional jet fuel (Jet A-1), allowing it to be processed through the same supply chain without the need for changes to existing infrastructure or aircraft engines. The use of SAF can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to traditional jet fuel, a significant advancement in the effort to decarbonize the aviation sector, which is responsible for nearly 5 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions.

Civil Aviation Minister Samah el-Hefny emphasised Egypt’s support for the new strategic plan of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).

The minister also asserted that the Ministry places the improvement of personnel and the modernisation of technical infrastructure at the top of its priorities, in alignment with the highest international standards.

This came during el-Hefny’s participation in the 13th Meeting of Civil Aviation Authority Officials for the North America, Central America and Caribbean Region (NACC/DCA/13), organised by the ICAO in Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic.

The event witnessed broad participation from chairpersons and representatives of civil aviation authorities in the Member States, as well as heads of relevant regional and international organisations.

El-Hefny emphasised that the participation of the Ministry of Civil Aviation reflects its continuous commitment to enhancing co-operation with ICAO and the Member States.

He also highlighted the importance of such meetings for exchanging expertise and coordinating policies to address the sector’s challenges.

The minister stated that Egypt pays great attention to regional integration and mutual technical co-operation, as well as aligning its national legislation with international requirements.

This is within the framework of balancing market liberalisation with the protection of developing countries’ interests.

The meeting addressed the main pillars of ICAO’s new strategic plan (2026–2050), most notably the modernisation of the air navigation system, economic regulation, and human resource development.

The attendees also discussed developments in air transport and regional connectivity, reviewed the outcomes of the World Air Cargo Summit, and considered the recommendations of the ICAO Air Services Negotiation Events (ICAN).

On the sidelines of the meeting, Minister el-Hefny participated in the 12th Session of the Steering Committee of the Multiregional Assistance Programme (MCAAP – RLA/09/801 PSC/12), which addressed ways to enhance the capabilities of civil aviation authorities in the fields of safety and security, as well as in training, air transport, and compliance with international standards.

The committee also reviewed the tangible progress in implementing environmental initiatives adopted by ICAO, including the Sustainable Aviation Fuel programme (ACT-SAF), the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), as well as national action plans to reduce emissions.

This comes within the global trend towards a more sustainable aviation sector.

The minister concluded his participation by emphasising Egypt’s continued support for the sustainable development of the aviation sector, both regionally and internationally, through active participation in ICAO’s environmental and technical initiatives, and by enhancing institutional and operational performance.

Nebraska's corn industry could find new market in sustainable aviation fuel

Rep. Mike Flood convened a conference at the museum on Friday. The goal, he said, was to help Nebraska farmers learn about potential opportunities with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

""We woke up on third base on the sustainable aviation issue. There are states that aren't to first base,"" Flood said. ""God made Nebraska for corn.""

Sustainable aviation fuel is essentially ethanol for aviation. To meet environmental standards, carbon dioxide, a byproduct of ethanol production, has to be captured and buried underground. Nebraska has a more developed infrastructure for this process compared to neighboring states like Iowa and South Dakota.

While some see opportunities to make money, not everyone in agriculture agrees that sustainable aviation fuel is beneficial.

""What they're talking about, in terms of sustainable aviation fuel, is a fairy tale,"" said Trent Loos, rancher and political activist.

Loos also objects to tax credits for the industry.

""They say that it costs too much to be competitive. In what industry do we try to prop something up to be competitive when it's not competitive?"" he said.

CO2 pipeline opponents often raise concerns about safety.

""You know, for years and years and years, we've had these debates about underground pipelines. They are the safest,"" Flood said.

Michael Gibbern, president of the Nebraska Corn Growers Association, believes SAF would boost the agricultural economy, especially with current low corn prices.

""Economically, for sustainable aviation fuel to be a viable option and to get it off the ground, no pun intended, it's gonna take some government help. Some tax credits,"" Gibbern said.

Flood compared SAF to the rise in ethanol production a generation ago.

""Well, look at what Nebraska and the Feds did in the early part of the 2000s where we had the EPIC program that jump-started ethanol plant production in Nebraska,"" Flood said.

Unlike Iowa, the potential use of eminent domain for CO2 pipelines hasn't been a major issue in Nebraska.

He said the Nebraska Legislature’s move in 2021 to enable ethanol plants to sequester and store carbon dioxide has given the state an advantage.

Flood: “We woke up on third base on the sustainable aviation issue. There are states that aren’t to first base. We’ve got this pipeline running across Nebraska that puts us in the driver’s seat, now we just need to take advantage of it and deliver.”

Dawn Caldwell of conference host Renewable Fuels Nebraska said the ability to capture and store carbon dioxide is a priority for potential airline customers.

Caldwell: “Nebraska could be a great place for making sustainable aviation fuel, for putting a facility here to make the product. We have a few things in our favor. One, we have a state leadership that’s very much in favor of expanding our value-added opportunities for our grains -- and that would be sustainable aviation fuel. Two, we have the feedstock.”

Flood said although the Big Beautiful Bill signed by President Donald Trump reduced incentives for sustainable aviation fuels from $1.75 to $1 a gallon, it did extend incentives for the clean fuel until 2029.

Flood: “There’s more work to be done, but I think as this nascent opportunity grows there’s going to be growth in sustainable aviation sales and we in Nebraska should lead the way.”

Conference speakers noted the role government energy incentives had in boosting the ethanol industry at the turn of the century and said sustainable aviation fuel could be the development that supports the next generation of Nebraska agriculture.

Caldwell: “Does Nebraska make sense, absolutely. Can we get there with our state legislation incentives, with whatever federal incentives may come along and garner that major private investment that is necessary to put the business in Nebraska? That up for the companies to go find, but we believe we’re in a really good spot.”

Flood said the conference comes at the dawn of a new market for Nebraska ag products.

Flood: “What I wanted to have happen today is for a farmer to leave here and the corn growers to leave here and say ‘when we talk ethanol we need to talk SAF. When we talk SAF we need to talk biofuels. We are and can be what Iowa is to ethanol in sustainable aviation fuel.”

Can we get there with our state legislation incentives, with whatever federal incentives may come along and garner that major private investment that is necessary to put the business in Nebraska? That up for the companies to go find, but we believe we’re in a really good spot.”

Flood said the conference comes at the dawn of a new market for Nebraska ag products.

Flood: “What I wanted to have happen today is for a farmer to leave here and the corn growers to leave here and say ‘when we talk ethanol we need to talk SAF. When we talk SAF we need to talk biofuels. We are and can be what Iowa is to ethanol in sustainable aviation fuel.”

Flood credited Tallgrass for its ability to engage Nebraskans to gain support for converting a natural gas pipeline into a Co2 pipeline.",https://RIVERCOUNTRYNCN.images.worldnow.com/images/26692426_G.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 20:56:09.599216

The stock’s performance coincided with the airline’s decision to divest its renewable fuels unit, Saffire Renewables, to Conestoga Energy. The sale includes intellectual property, leadership, and a planned sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pilot facility in Kansas. This move reflects a strategic retreat from climate-focused initiatives, including layoffs of staff dedicated to reducing emissions and expanding SAF use.

The transaction underscores broader challenges in the aviation sector’s progress toward climate goals, such as achieving zero carbon emissions by 2050. Growth in cleaner jet fuels has lagged industry projections, and reduced government incentives for SAF production—like a trimmed Trump-era credit—have heightened financial pressures for producers. Southwest’s shift follows a pattern of scaling back sustainability efforts, despite earlier investments in Saffire and the creation of a dedicated renewable ventures unit in 2024.

Conestoga, a leading biofuel provider, emphasized Saffire’s ethanol-to-SAF technology as a scalable solution for low-carbon fuel production. The acquisition aligns with Conestoga’s existing ethanol operations and carbon capture capabilities. CEO Tom Willis highlighted the potential for Saffire’s technology to expand beyond aviation fuel, though he acknowledged the need for sustained demand in low-carbon markets. Southwest stated its support for the technology’s commercialization but did not disclose the sale price.

Jet fuel made from biomass could be the answer they are looking for.

At Friday’s Sustainable Aviation Fuels Conference in Ashland, political and business leaders alike said the state is well-positioned to become a major player in the burgeoning industry. Jacki Fee, a biofuels specialist with Cargill, explained why.

“Nebraska is uniquely advantaged, not only with the rail infrastructure, but also we have blending terminals, and we have pipelines, and we have just infrastructure in general that is going to be very supportive of having a new fuel market come into the state,” she said.

Jan tenBensel, who chairs the Nebraska Ethanol Board, said he’s working to market the state’s biofuels potential to the aviation industry.

“The the biggest message that I'd want to get out there is we have this low carbon product right now called corn ethanol, and it is here, and it's available today in mass quantities, and we can make more quickly in 18 months,” he said.

He also stressed that Nebraska’s ethanol production in recent years has not taken away from other uses. Instead, higher yields due to technological advances have allowed the state to produce more corn and soybeans than ever before.

“Since ethanol has come onto the stage, every kernel of corn used for ethanol is new production produced with essentially the same amount of fertilizer we were using 40 years ago,” tenBensel said.

Green industrial revolution opportunities will now go overseas The closure of Vivergo Fuels in Hull is more than the loss of a plant (Paul Kenward writes).
Vivergo’s closure should not close the conversation, but unless the government acts now, the UK’s green industrial future will be built abroad.","The fate of a second bioethanol factory, Ensus UK, which operates at the Wilton International site near Redcar and is owned by Germany’s CropEnergies, is also hanging in the balance. However, it remains in talks with the government over whether the plant, which employs about 100 workers, can continue as the UK’s maker of CO₂ — a byproduct of bioethanol production that is used in everything from fizzy drinks to NHS operating theatres.

Both companies have been warning of the risk of closure since Sir Keir Starmer’s trade deal with President Trump in May cut to zero the UK’s 19 per cent tariff on up to 1.4 billion litres of US bioethanol imports a year. That is roughly equivalent to the UK’s entire annual consumption.

On the insistence of the US president, who is keen to preserve American farming jobs, the prime minister agreed to a last-minute concession, blindsiding the two companies that make up Britain’s bioethanol industry. They produce green fuel from non-food grade wheat that is used in E10 petrol — which is fossil-fuel petrol containing up to 10 per cent renewable ethanol, to lower its emissions. The companies also make animal feed.

• Alistair Osborne: Unexpected extras in US trade deal

The trade deal prompted months of negotiations over a potential bailout but Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, has now decided that he cannot justify propping up the sector with taxpayer subsidies. The news was broken to the companies in a meeting with Sarah Jones, the minister for industry.

In a statement, the government said that it always took decisions in the national interest: “That’s why we negotiated a landmark deal with the US which protected hundreds of thousands of jobs in sectors like auto and aerospace.”

It said it had “worked closely” with the two companies since June “to understand the financial challenges they have faced over the past decade, and have taken the difficult decision not to offer direct funding as it would not provide value for the taxpayer or solve the long-term problems the industry faces”.

Paul Kenward, chief executive of ABF Sugar, has long said, even before the trade deal, that the sector’s difficulties have been caused by government regulation that favoured US exporters.

A spokesman for ABF said: “We presented a clear plan to restore Vivergo to profitability within two years under policy levers already aligned with the government’s own green industrial strategy. The government has thrown away billions in potential growth in the Humber and a sovereign capability in clean fuels that had the chance to lead the world. Jobs in clean energy will now move overseas.”

• Tariffs blamed as Britain’s exports to US drop to lowest since 2022

ABF, which has invested more than £700 million in Vivergo over the past decade, added: “This plant should always have been profitable under the right regulatory environment, as similar plants in western Europe demonstrate.”

The company, which said that its supply chain supports “4,000 livelihoods”, was also “hugely disappointed” that “the press was informed of this decision before we were told — and before we had a chance to communicate to our staff”.

Supporters of the government’s decision pointed out that ABF, which also owns the retailer Primark, is controlled by the billionaire Weston family, who could have put in more funds.

The government offered a possible reprieve to Ensus, which is ahead of Vivergo when it comes to CO₂ production, saying: “We also continue to work up proposals that ensure the resilience of our CO₂ supply in the long term, in consultation with the sector.”

Grant Pearson, chairman of Ensus UK, said that at the meeting with Jones, she confirmed that the government values “our production of biogenic CO₂ which is a product of critical national importance. They are therefore looking at options to secure an ongoing supply of CO₂ from the Ensus facility.” He said, however, that it will “take time” to agree “an acceptable long-term arrangement”.

Green industrial revolution opportunities will now go overseas

The closure of Vivergo Fuels in Hull is more than the loss of a plant (Paul Kenward writes). It is a warning about how Britain risks closing itself off from the future fuels revolution, and how, in the process, UK PLC risks squandering a real opportunity to create high-quality green industrial jobs.

For Hull, bioethanol should have been the start of a green industrial revolution: a hub for low-carbon fuels serving UK transport, shipping and aviation, with skilled employment, investment in infrastructure and growth for the region’s farmers and suppliers. Instead, that future will now happen overseas — in countries with which Britain competes for increasingly scarce investment and growth.

I am, of course, deeply saddened for our 160 colleagues who are losing their jobs, and for the thousands more across the supply chain — from the farmers at the 12,500 farms supplying our wheat to the hauliers, engineers and contractors whose livelihoods depend on the plant. They will no doubt be deeply frustrated, as I am, at the ministerial inaction that has led us to this point.

• Sharon Graham: Path to green energy should not be littered with job losses

Over the past decade ABF has invested more than £700 million in Vivergo, sustaining it through extended losses caused by policy distortions unique to the UK. Under competitive and stable market conditions, bioethanol could and should be a hugely profitable sector. All we needed from the government, since the shock of the trade deal that gave away the entire market to subsidised US competitors, was time-limited support to bridge the period until regulatory changes, already in line with the government’s stated direction, were in place.

For several years a UK-only regulatory loophole gave foreign producers an artificial price advantage in our own market. No other country applies such a rule to its domestic producers. Then, in May, the surprise removal of the 19 per cent tariff on US ethanol imports as part of the trade deal, done with no notice and no transition plan, made it impossible for UK plants to compete in their own market. If Vivergo had been in Rotterdam, where these distortions do not exist, it would be successful.

The result of the refusal to support Vivergo is a message to investors that the UK is willing to cede sovereign fuel capabilities to overseas competitors, even in sectors directly aligned with its growth and net-zero priorities. The cost of doing business in UK regulated sectors is becoming too high, not because the industries lack potential but because unpredictable policy shifts and regulatory inconsistency make it too risky to commit long-term capital.

This is about more than one plant. Future fuels, from sustainable aviation fuel to advanced biofuels, are a huge global growth opportunity. Other countries are locking in their share. In the US, a clear policy framework has driven record bioethanol output and exports, underpinned rural economies and attracted billions in private investment. Across the EU bioethanol production is growing.

• Taxpayer will subsidise industry energy bills to help firms compete

The UK could have been part of this story. Saltend Chemicals Park, where Vivergo is based, has the potential to generate £24.2 billion in GVA (gross value added) by 2050, rising to £50 billion with planned investments. That included a signed memorandum of understanding with Meld Energy for a £1.25 billion sustainable aviation fuel facility, projected to add £7.3 billion to the economy over its lifetime. But with Vivergo gone, the domestic ethanol supply this project depended on will no longer exist. That means the investment may now go abroad, along with the jobs, skills and growth it would have brought to the UK.

The government had a clear window to safeguard a strategic industry and chose not to take it. Failing to act now sends the wrong message: that Britain is content to become an import-only market for the very fuels and technologies it will depend on to hit net zero. It signals to investors that they must factor in the risk that future policy changes or trade deals could abruptly undermine entire sectors — making every emerging clean energy industry, from sustainable aviation fuel to hydrogen, a more uncertain and risky investment.

Vivergo’s closure should not close the conversation, but unless the government acts now, the UK’s green industrial future will be built abroad. The investment, jobs and skills that could have been anchored in places like Hull will instead flow to countries with clearer, more consistent regulatory regimes. Britain will end up importing fuels and technologies it could have produced at home, paying a premium for the privilege, and watching the economic opportunity of a generation slip through its fingers.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fc9b8562f-3be6-4fc8-8237-a4668697fa20.jpg?crop=1200%2C675%2C0%2C88&resize=1200,N,,2025-08-15 18:56:25.368755

BioMADE will operate the facility in coordination with ISU Research Park.
To address this gap, BioMADE worked with partners at the U.S. Department of Defense, the Iowa Economic Development Authority, Iowa State University and the Iowa State University Research Park to establish this facility and continue the growth of its national Pilot Plant Network.
“Collaborations like the one with BioMADE, IEDA, ISU Research Park and Iowa State exemplify how these entities can come together to accelerate breakthroughs that will shape the next generation of sustainable, resilient ag technologies,” said Rick Sanders, president, ISU Research Park.","BioMADE, a Department of Defense Manufacturing Innovation Institute, has selected Iowa to establish a bioindustrial manufacturing scale-up facility at Iowa State University’s (ISU) BioCentury Research Farm in Boone.

The 15,000-square-foot facility will include 5,000-liter and 10,000-liter fermenters and downstream processing equipment, enabling companies to scale up fermentation-based technologies using Iowa’s agricultural feedstocks, with an opening date of early 2028.

At a total project value of $40 million, BioMADE has committed at least $20 million, which will be matched by up to $10 million in cost-share contributions from ISU and $10 million in funding from IEDA’s Strategic Infrastructure Program over two fiscal years.

BioMADE will operate the facility in coordination with ISU Research Park. The announcement was made at the Iowa Economic Development Authority board meeting today. This is the third major site for BioMADE. Others are in California and Minnesota.

BioMADE’s facility will be designed to complement other Iowa-based facilities, like ISU’s Center for Crops Utilization Research, to increase the speed at which companies can move through technological development and scale-up processes.

According to project officials, the bioindustrial manufacturing industry in the U.S. currently faces a scale-up challenge due to a critical lack of pilot- to demonstration-scale infrastructure. As a result, American companies often have to seek relevant facilities overseas, taking American innovation with them and risking IP loss. To address this gap, BioMADE worked with partners at the U.S. Department of Defense, the Iowa Economic Development Authority, Iowa State University and the Iowa State University Research Park to establish this facility and continue the growth of its national Pilot Plant Network.

The announcement comes on the heels of U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s visit to the Ames National Laboratory on Thursday, where he discussed the importance of research in becoming energy independent

“Iowa is proud to partner with the U.S. Department of Defense and BioMADE to build the infrastructure needed to lead in the next generation of biomanufacturing,” Gov. Kim Reynolds said in a news release. “This facility will unleash new value from our agricultural resources, create high-quality jobs, and ensure Iowa remains at the forefront of bioscience innovation and global competitiveness.”

The project will support workforce development, startup growth, and technology commercialization, according to IEDA. The goal is to help Iowa diversify beyond traditional biofuels and attract early-stage companies to establish permanent operations in the state.

“Iowa’s longstanding leadership in bioindustrial manufacturing makes it an ideal site for scale-up capacity,” said Douglas Friedman, BioMADE’s CEO, in a news release. “We’re excited to work with our partners at Iowa State University to establish this site, which will secure domestic supply chains for critical consumer and defense products – while also creating new markets for American-grown crops, re-shoring manufacturing jobs, and expanding rural development.”

One of 95 active BioMADE projects nationally is the jet fuel program at ISU. This project is developing methods to scale up the conversion and recovery of fatty acids precursors for sustainable aviation fuel.

“Collaborations like the one with BioMADE, IEDA, ISU Research Park and Iowa State exemplify how these entities can come together to accelerate breakthroughs that will shape the next generation of sustainable, resilient ag technologies,” said Rick Sanders, president, ISU Research Park. “We’re proud to be part of a movement that has the potential to secure additional value and products from crops produced right here in Iowa and in turn, strengthen the bioeconomy.”",https://www.businessrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BioMADE-logo.jpeg,N,,2025-08-15 17:56:25.128155

The deal includes all intellectual property, technology, and leadership tied to a planned sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pilot plant. Financial terms remain undisclosed.

The sale follows layoffs affecting seven of Southwest’s ten sustainability staff, signaling a shift in focus just as the aviation sector faces mounting pressure to meet net-zero goals by 2050. Southwest says it still intends to cut single-use plastics by 50% by 2025 and reduce carbon emissions intensity by 25% by 2030, alongside replacing 10% of its jet fuel with SAF. Whether that last target is achievable without Saffire is now uncertain.

Industry-wide, SAF adoption remains slow due to high costs, supply constraints, and questionable lifecycle emissions benefits.

How to reset things with Mexico

By Jordan Brennan, RBC’s Head of Thought Leadership

Six months into President Trump’s trade war, with no deal in sight, Canada has good reason to deepen its partnership with Mexico. (And, based on a couple of recent trips south, the federal and Alberta governments agree).

Despite being Canada’s third largest trading partner, Mexico accounts for less than 4% of Canada’s global merchandise trade, the bulk of which is imports. In 2024, Canada shipped just $9 billion of goods to Mexico while importing $47 billion of Mexican goods.

Make no mistake, no country can displace the U.S. when it comes to trading significance for Canada. But we see three broad areas where Canada and Mexico can deepen ties.

Build Bridges & Infrastructure. Canada’s ‘Maple Eight’ pension funds, with north of $2 trillion in assets, are among the largest in the world and possess expertise in major infrastructure projects like pipelines, rail and port capacity. That’s what Mexico needs: patient capital with financing expertise. Canadian capital is a source of financial influence that could be leveraged to advance geopolitical and trade interests, and enhance commercial ties. Canadian Pacific Kansas City Rail’s investment in the Patrick J. Ottensmeyer International Railway Bridge—a $100M project launched earlier this year that deployed innovative technology to improve continental cargo mobility on the U.S.-Mexico border—is a case in point.

Boost Bilateral Trade. Many of Canada’s export industries—from energy to steel and aluminum, copper, agri-food, softwood lumber, pulp and paper, and plastics—are products the 130-million strong nation imports. Enhanced trade flows, underwritten by the current CUSMA, could help several of our stressed industries find relief.

Unite On CUSMA. While the U.S. will remain the cornerstone of North American trade, both Canada and Mexico must prepare for the joint review of the CUSMA, which is officially scheduled for 2026 but may come sooner. Rather than being played against one another, which Trump has successfully orchestrated until now, diplomatic coordination between Canada and Mexico could affirm treaty mechanisms, ensuring duty-free access for CUSMA-compliant goods. Trade irritants in specific industries (think supply management) and trans-shipment for Chinese goods must be managed. With trade nested in a broader framework that includes border security, defence, infrastructure, and supply chain integrity, all three countries can be made better off by deepening their cooperation, ensuring balanced and mutually beneficial trade across the bloc.

Canola in the crossfire

By Yadullah Hussain, Managing Editor, RBC Thought Leadership

Canada’s canola crisis has deepened. Beijing’s 75.8% duty on Canada’s most valuable crop comes after its preliminary investigation found Ottawa provided subsidies and preferential treatment to its farmers.

The levy on canola seeds adds to Beijing’s 100% tariffs already in effect on Canada’s canola oil and meals. Back in April, the Canadian Canola Growers Association (CCGA) told us that farmers were freezing investments over fears that a tariff on canola seeds was the “big shoe to drop.” Chris Davison, President and CEO of the Canola Council of Canada, now believes the Chinese market is “effectively closed” to Canadian canola producers.

That’s another $4.5 billion of commodity trade disrupted and now in search of new, tariff-free markets, joining lumber, aluminum and steel.

Here’s how Canada’s canola crisis is playing out:

Squeezed by two economic giants: Could Beijing be trying to get Ottawa to remove the 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs, and 25% on Chinese steel and aluminum? Beijing will make a final call on canola seed duties in September. But Ottawa is in a bind as it had raised tariffs on imported aluminum and steel to appease Washington’s concern that countries, including China, were Canada as a backdoor to the U.S. market.

Meal plan goes awry: China’s canola meal imports from Canada whittled down to 32,506 tonnes in June—from 141,938 tonnes in June 2024—Statistics Canada data shows.

Oil turmoil: Canada’s canola oil exportsto China amounted to a big fat zero from China in June, industry data shows.

Seed money: Canada’s canola seed shipment to China had fallen to 237,897 tonnes by June 2025, compared to 651,080 tonnes during the same period last year.

Farmers want a cash injection: Farmers should not be asked to borrow their way through a crisis that’s not of their making, the CCGA states. Although that would only exacerbate Beijing’s concerns of Ottawa subsidizing the industry.

Beijing’s concerns of Ottawa subsidizing the industry.

Ease the pain: Boosting domestic demand and processing capacity of biofuels like Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) presents one opportunity to diversify canola demand as a biofuel feedstock. According to Lisa Ashton, our Agriculture Policy Lead: “Canada should consider looking at other countries’ playbooks for expanding domestic biofuel markets and agriculture’s role in its growth.” Brazil, Japan, and Malaysia are all expanding processing capacity for biofuels including SAF and increasing required biodiesel and ethanol blends in convention fuels.

“Our limitation is not policy, but infrastructure”

Q: What can the federal government do to lessen our dependence on the U.S.?

A: We face significant constraints. Canada’s ability to expand trade with other countries through trade agreements is largely exhausted. India and China, for geopolitical reasons, are unlikely prospects in the near term. Our limitation is not policy, but infrastructure. Geography remains a stubborn fact that requires substantial infrastructure investment. Expanding upon our rail and port infrastructure is a renewed priority federally but will take many years to move the needle.

Q: What do you see as the long-term impact of Trump’s tariff wars globally?

A: The uncertainty from tariff threats alone dampens investment. That itself may lead to a permanent reduction in Canadian productivity if investors perceive a higher level of risk in Canada due to uncertain market access in the U.S. Globally, if there’s one lesson from the 1930s, it’s that protectionist spirals deepen economic pain for all participants. While tariffs might temporarily boost some U.S. industries, the costs to global efficiency and consumer welfare would be substantial.

Q: Are there any new insights that challenge the prevailing wisdom about the broad-based benefits of free trade?

A: The fundamental case for liberalized trade remains strong. But it requires resources, production, and employment to shift across sectors and regions. Some of my work suggests between 1-2% of Canada’s workforce could migrate across provinces in response to eliminating internal trade costs. While these moves are productivity-enhancing for the overall economy in the long run, there are adjustment costs for individuals and some affected businesses impose significant short-term costs on those individuals.

“I say hogwash.” Both men agreed that increasing demand is the fastest way to boost prices, though high input costs remain a problem.","KEARNEY, Neb. – “We have the potential to lose an entire generation of farmers in the next couple years,” said Jan tenBensel, a Cambridge farmer and chair of the Nebraska Ethanol Board.

TenBensel’s warning comes as Nebraska braces for what could be a record corn crop — a bounty that’s creating challenges in marketing grain at a profitable price.

Governor Jim Pillen, a hog farmer turned politician, continues to frame agriculture as the centerpiece of his plan to grow the state.

“We have an extraordinary economy in this state. Agriculture’s a key piece, manufacturing too. We make things nowhere else in the world can be made. We need to brag, and appreciate it more,” Pillen said at the Governor’s Summit in Kearney.

Pillen says Nebraska must move away from selling raw commodities and toward value-added agriculture.

“We are tired of putting corn and soybeans on barges and shipping them around the world. We’re giving the topsoil away. We’re getting out of the commodity business and creating more value,” he told the Rural Radio Network.

That includes carbon capture projects aimed at producing low-carbon fuel for cars and airplanes.

“The extraordinary bioeconomy includes sustainable aviation fuel. We’ve spearheaded that. A lot of states haven’t been able to go there because of politics. We don’t play politics,” Pillen said.

USDA Deputy Secretary Stephen Vaden echoed the call, saying that when people pass Nebraska’s cornfields, they should think “fuel” as much as “food.”

“Nebraska’s leading the charge with biofuels but we need a permanent E15 solution from Congress so businesses can invest with certainty,” Vaden said.

TenBensel argues that year-round E15 could be a lifeline for farmers.

“For each percent of national ethanol we increase, it’s about a half-billion bushels of corn… This is a lot of corn, a low price, well below the price of production. We have to use more of our corn here at home,” he said.

Trade was another hot topic at the summit. Vaden noted that U.S. agricultural exports have slipped from surplus into deficit. While tariffs draw headlines, he said other barriers are just as damaging.

“Many of the barriers producers face aren’t just tariffs… they’re false claims about health or pest risks… and that’s bunk,” Vaden said.

“You used the word bunk,” Pillen interjected. “I say hogwash.”

Both men agreed that increasing demand is the fastest way to boost prices, though high input costs remain a problem.

TenBensel closed his remarks with optimism about corn’s potential beyond fuel.

“There’s not much you can’t make from a kernel of corn… we can use corn products on a mass scale if we choose to.”

The Governor’s Summit in Kearney drew more than 900 participants, from high school students exploring career opportunities to industry leaders debating Nebraska’s role in the future of the bioeconomy.",https://media.ruralradio.co/nrr/uploads/2025/08/Copy-of-Feature-Story-5.png,N,,2025-08-15 13:56:27.959783

AI growth is driving an urgent need for around-the-clock power that intermittent renewables cannot deliver. Nuclear is stepping into that gap, offering unmatched reliability, zero emissions and multi-decade operating lives.

Figure 1 shows which operators have new build and repower potential across their nuclear fleets, divided into tiers of progress.

Federal tax credit extensions, bonus depreciation and incentives for nuclear energy communities are adding further tailwinds, making new investments and long-term contracts even more attractive. This policy backdrop is also spurring new investment in small modular reactors, with operators like VST, TLN and CEG exploring projects that could add flexible, carbon-free capacity in new locations and on faster timelines.

For plant owners, the pitch is straightforward: data centers will pay a premium for guaranteed megawatts, evidenced by NRG announcing the signing of a 10-year contract at $70-$90 per megawatt hour in its Q2 earnings call last week. For investors, these agreements can revalue projects overnight, and analysts are keeping a close eye on every hint of a new deal.

MZT launched its first plant in 2023, developed in partnership with Sheffield University. Capable of recovering 50 tonnes of CO2 per year, its captured carbon is used to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). According to MZT, this latest Canadian deployment marks not only a fivefold increase in scale of capture from that first platform, but also a 60 per cent reduction in cost.

“This electrochemical air capture recovers five times more carbon and is 60 per cent cheaper than our first deployment in 2023 in Sheffield - a remarkable improvement by any measure,” said Dr Nicholas Chadwick, MZT co-founder and CEO.

“Mission Zero’s strategy has always centred around commercial viability - meaning we make smaller DAC systems out of ‘off-the-shelf’ parts, serving established supply chains. This approach has been a big factor in our ability to progress beyond the lab more quickly than other DAC providers, turning theoretical solutions into proven, practical ones.

“By deploying more quickly, our DAC solutions are able to gather the data investors and future customers need to see and give our team a head start on optimising our systems.”

MZT’s second deployment, also capable of capturing 250 tonnes of CO2, is exploring a different strand of utilisation. Developed in partnership with O.C.O Technology and the UK Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ), the Norfolk project’s carbon supply is used by O.C.O. in its building materials, enabling carbon-negative limestone.",https://www.theengineer.co.uk/media/rcybovyk/mission-zero_deep-sky-system-3.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 14:56:29.400457

These flights are operated by Air Hong Kong, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Cathay Group, which principally operates express cargo services for DHL Express.
This SAF deal builds on the long-standing partnership between DHL Express and the Cathay Group, including through Air Hong Kong.
For more than two decades, Air Hong Kong has played a vital role in DHL Express's Asia Pacific network.
The Cathay Group also includes cargo division Cathay Cargo, low-cost carrier HK Express and various other subsidiaries.","DHL Express purchases 2,400 tonnes of SAF from Cathay Group to be used on flights operated by Air Hong Kong, an express all-cargo carrier and wholly owned subsidiary of Cathay.

The SAF will be used on Air Hong Kong flights departing from Seoul Incheon, Tokyo Narita and Singapore Changi airports.

The new agreement underscores both parties' commitment to lower-carbon air logistics and driving the production and use of SAF for the air cargo sector.

Wednesday 13 August 2025 DHL Express and the Cathay Group have entered into a new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) partnership that reinforces their shared commitment to reducing carbon emissions in the air cargo industry. Under the agreement, Cathay will supply DHL Express with 2,400 tonnes of SAF for international flights departing from three airports in Asia namely Seoul Incheon International Airport, Tokyo Narita International Airport, and Singapore Changi Airport. These flights are operated by Air Hong Kong, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Cathay Group, which principally operates express cargo services for DHL Express. ?

Continuing through 2025, the partnership is expected to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 7,190 tonnes - equivalent to the emissions of over 100 flights from Hong Kong to Singapore with an Airbus 330 freighter. ? ?

DHL Express Senior Vice President for Network Operations & Aviation - Asia Pacific Peter Bardens said: 'Sustainable aviation fuel currently accounts for less than 1% of the total global jet fuel consumption, yet air transport is one of our biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Our decision to expand our SAF usage in Asia with Cathay is another important step that we have taken to drive momentum in SAF production and demand.

'DHL Express is at the forefront of SAF adoption, and we look forward to seeing more partners and customers join us on this journey to build a more robust SAF ecosystem in Asia. Our continued investment in this area aligns with DHL Group's Strategy 2030, which recognises 'green logistics of choice' as one of the four bottom lines.' ?

This SAF deal builds on the long-standing partnership between DHL Express and the Cathay Group, including through Air Hong Kong. For more than two decades, Air Hong Kong has played a vital role in DHL Express's Asia Pacific network. This latest collaboration builds on that strong foundation and paves the way for deeper cooperation in advancing SAF.

Cathay Director Cargo Tom Owen said: 'This partnership marks the first SAF uplift on Air Hong Kong flights, a key milestone for Cathay as we continue to expand the SAF usage across our global network. SAF remains a core pillar of our strategy to address our carbon emissions, and collaboration is essential to scaling its use. We are excited to be working with like-minded partners like DHL Express to make SAF more accessible and scalable, particularly in Asia.'

This collaboration makes DHL Express the latest strategic partner of Cathay's Corporate SAF Programme, an initiative launched in 2022 to support corporate partners in addressing greenhouse gas emissions from business travel and airfreight through the use of SAF. In 2024, the Corporate SAF Programme enabled the use of over 6,000 tonnes of SAF, with a record 16 partners participating, including HSBC, AIA and Standard Chartered. ?

Cathay has been steadily expanding its SAF efforts across the region. Earlier in 2025, the Group entered into an agreement with Sinopec to uplift SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland at Hong Kong International Airport, marking the first such export by Sinopec to Hong Kong. Additionally, Cathay has partnered with SK Energy to secure SAF supply in South Korea from 2025 to 2027. Apart from working closely with suppliers, the Group also co-initiated the Hong Kong Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition (HKSAFC) to collectively drive policy development and adoption of SAF locally. These initiatives reflect Cathay's mission to expand the use of SAF within its network and foster a regional SAF ecosystem.

Investments in SAF are therefore critical to ensuring its availability on a long-term and predictable basis. DHL Express has also been a frontrunner in scaling SAF uptake globally, securing long-term SAF agreements with multiple partners, including Neste, bp, and World Energy. Earlier this year, DHL Express also partnered with Cosmo Oil Marketing to use SAF produced in Japan for flights departing the country. Most recently, DHL Express completed an agreement with Neste that comprises 7,400 tonnes of SAF for international flights departing from Singapore Changi Airport, further demonstrating the company's proactive approach to driving SAF demand and supply across the region. ?

These efforts will also enhance DHL's understanding of how to transport these alternative fuels, as it is a segment under its Strategy 2030's key growth sector, 'New Energy.' DHL Group is developing end-to-end logistics solutions for eight segments: wind, solar, electric vehicle (EV) and batteries, battery and energy storage systems, EV charging, grid, alternative fuel and hydrogen. ?

In 2024, the profit was 905 million euros. This is the first time since the pandemic that the company made a profit in its quarter earnings.

IAG’s financial performance

In terms of revenue, there was an 8% improvement from 14.724 billion euros in the first half of last year to 15.906 billion euros in the first half of 2025. This shows that IAG’s airlines are becoming more popular with customers. In addition, the fact that revenue has increased but profit has increased to a greater extent indicates that cost control has also improved.

The situation has not always been so easy for the company. During the pandemic, IAG’s financial performance, like many, was severely affected due to governments restricting international travel. In the aftermath, the subsequent surge in demand and resulting staff shortages (as many had been laid off during the pandemic when demand was less) meant that the recovery took time, as airports had to restrict flight numbers to reduce congestion. British Airways, one of IAG’s subsidiaries, was credited for taking the initiative to voluntarily reduce flight numbers before mandatory restrictions came in.

Further Investments

Now that IAG is well and truly back in the black, there are ambitious plans for IAG’s investments. In Latin America (which includes Mexico and Central American countries), IAG’s growth in 2024 resulted in a 16% increase in seat capacity (number of seats available). In the first half of 2025, there has already been a 7% increase in seat capacity. There is also expansion taking place in North America, with growth in seat capacity of 1.1%. In Europe, IAG’s growth was overall 2.8% in terms of seat capacity for flights within Europe in general and 3.5% for flights domestically within Spain.

IAG is also strengthening its airline value by investing in improving its customer experience. British Airways, for example, has refreshed lounges in Lagos, Seattle, Singapore and Washington Dulles airport in the first half of 2025. It has plans to refit its Dubai and Miami lounges in the second half of the year. Aer Lingus, another IAG subsidiary, is introducing artificial intelligence (which is essentially technology-assisted customer service) to provide customers with a quicker service. In addition, the airline is also introducing a self-service tool for hotel accommodation to use in the event of disruption. Iberia, the Spanish flagship carrier and another subsidiary of IAG, is rolling out free Wi-Fi to its club members. Finally, Vueling, another Spanish subsidiary, is rolling out onboard Wi-Fi.

IAG’s airlines are also investing in improving their operational performance, with British Airways and Aer Lingus having both improved in their punctuality. Iberia and Vueling also remain among the most punctual airlines in the world. IAG is also investing in modernising its fleet to reduce fuel consumption, providing more up-to-date cabins for customers and reducing carbon emissions.

Reducing Carbon Emissions

In addition to modernising its fleet, IAG is also taking other steps to reduce carbon emissions. IAG reports that it is progressing towards its aim to have net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. This means that on balance, it is on track to have no carbon emissions by this time. In the first half of 2025, the company secured 200,000 tonnes of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, which was a 25 % increase year-on-year. Sustainable aviation fuel is made from ethanol and other plant extracts and has a lower carbon footprint when compared to traditional jet fuel.

As one can see, this is a positive story for IAG’s financial performance. IAG is no longer well and truly in the black in terms of its financial bottom line. It is also making further investments to improve the customer experience and expand its reach. We have to wait to see how this progresses.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aerlingus3.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 12:57:31.132160

Our high-integrity durable carbon removal credits are generated from a process called Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), providing quantifiable, certified-permanent carbon removals to help companies to mitigate their carbon footprint. These credits are generated from our operational project and ready to retire immediately.

Here’s How Carbon Dioxide Removal Works

Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) removes carbon from the atmosphere by capturing CO2 generated by the fermentation process during ethanol production. The resulting biogenic CO2 stream (as a result of fermentation) is cleaned using a water scrubber, which separates any remaining ethanol and other impurities to produce a pure stream of CO2. From the scrubber, the captured, biogenic CO2 is sent to compressors. Upon compression, the CO2 is dehydrated to remove any remaining water and is then sent to a refrigeration unit where it is subcooled to a liquid. The condensed CO2 is then lightly distilled and pumped through a flowline to a Class VI injection well onsite, where it is sequestered permanently in the Broom Creek formation.

BECCS at Gevo North Dakota: Onsite Class VI well and no transportation needed

The entire carbon capture and sequestration process occurs at the Gevo North Dakota site and no offsite transportation of CO2 is needed. The facility site (both for the ethanol and co-products production, carbon capture equipment and the Class VI well) is approximately 150 acres in Richardton, North Dakota. The Gevo North Dakota property is ideally situated above the Broom Creek geological formation and can expand its annual CCS volumes from 180,000 tCO2 per year today to 1 million tCO2 each year.

The Class VI well permit and sequestered volumes are available on the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources website.

Engineering The engineering of biofuel production facilities involves designing efficient and sustainable systems to maximise yield and minimise environmental impact.
Process technology: Biofuel production can involve biochemical processes (like fermentation and anaerobic digestion) or thermochemical methods (such as pyrolysis and gasification).
Process efficiency is crucial in a biofuels plant because it directly impacts the overall sustainability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental benefits of biofuel production.
Waste management regulations: Biofuel production can generate by products and wastes, including spent biomass, ash, and chemical residues.","With ambitious targets set under the Climate Change Act, the UK aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Biofuels, particularly second-generation biofuels made from waste or non-food biomass, have gained prominence as part of this solution. They offer a renewable alternative to traditional fuels and can be integrated into existing energy infrastructures with relatively minor adjustments.

A significant development in the biofuel sector is the introduction of mandates for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The UK’s SAF mandate, driven by the need to decarbonise the aviation industry, requires airlines to increase the proportion of SAF in their fuel mix over the coming years (2% of the total aviation fuel mix must be SAF in 2025, rising to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040). This target increases annually to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040[1].

This regulatory shift has created a surge in demand for biofuel production facilities that can supply SAF, sparking a wave of investment and innovation. For biofuel producers, this presents both an opportunity, whilst also bringing in further challenges, such as scaling up production while meeting stringent quality and sustainability standards, more competition for feedstocks, and greater pressure on cost and carbon efficiency requirements.

In addition, the UK government’s Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF) is a significant initiative aimed at accelerating the development and commercial deployment of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production technologies. With an allocation of over £135 million, the AFF supports innovative projects that convert waste materials and by-products, such as household waste and industrial gases, into low-carbon fuels.

This initiative is part of the government’s broader strategy to achieve net zero emissions and enhance the UK’s position as a leader in the SAF industry. The fund is expected to create up to 10,000 green jobs by 2035 and contribute approximately £1.8 billion annually to the UK economy[2].

In this dynamic and rapidly evolving biofuel production sector, staying ahead of regulatory requirements and sound engineering practice is more crucial than ever. Successfully developing, constructing, and operating a biofuel production plant involves navigating complex engineering, planning, and permitting processes - requiring careful consideration to ensure both regulatory compliance and overall project success.

Engineering

The engineering of biofuel production facilities involves designing efficient and sustainable systems to maximise yield and minimise environmental impact.

Key considerations:

Feedstock selection and handling: Different feedstocks, such as agricultural residues, waste oils, or purpose-grown crops, require specific processing methods and storage systems. Proper engineering ensures that feedstock is handled and processed in a way that optimises production while minimising emissions and waste.

Process technology: Biofuel production can involve biochemical processes (like fermentation and anaerobic digestion) or thermochemical methods (such as pyrolysis and gasification). Selecting the appropriate technology based on feedstock availability and end-product requirements is crucial. Engineering teams must also design systems for efficient energy and resource use, integrating heat recovery and emissions control measures.

Process efficiency is crucial in a biofuels plant because it directly impacts the overall sustainability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental benefits of biofuel production. Efficient processes ensure that the maximum amount of biofuel is produced from the available feedstock, minimising waste and reducing the consumption of resources such as water and energy.

Waste and by-product management: Biofuel processes generate by-products like CO2, solid residues, or wastewater. Engineering solutions should address efficient by-product utilisation or safe disposal. Innovations like biogas capture for energy recovery or nutrient recycling in agriculture can add value and improve sustainability.

Safety and risk management: Handling flammable or corrosive materials requires robust safety measures, including fire suppression systems, chemical containment, and proper ventilation. A well-engineered facility minimises risks to both human health and the environment.

Planning

Key considerations:

The planning system must support innovation while balancing environmental, social and economic impacts. Some key elements that must be considered when planning for biofuel facilities:

Site selection and community involvement: Biofuels can be highly localised, meaning site selection plays a critical role in minimising transport emissions and logistical costs. Engaging local communities in the planning process ensures buy-in and mitigates potential objections related to noise, odour, and traffic.

Integration with existing infrastructure: Many biofuel projects can be co-located with existing agricultural, industrial, or waste-processing facilities. This can streamline the planning approval process while reducing land-use conflicts.

Planning policy: Biofuel projects must accord with both local development plans and national policies, such as the UK's Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO), to ensure compliance and long-term viability. Planning professionals must work closely with policy experts to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape.

Environmental impact assessments (EIA): Ensuring that biofuel production facilities do not adversely affect biodiversity, local ecosystems, water resources or local amenities. Proper waste management and emission control are crucial to avoid new environmental challenges.

As biofuel technology advances and the demand for renewable energy sources grows, the UK planning system will need to adapt to facilitate these projects while addressing concerns over land use, environmental impact, and community well-being. A proactive approach that fosters collaboration between developers, planners, and local stakeholders is essential for building a sustainable future.

Biofuels are not just a part of the renewable energy puzzle; they offer a way to harness the UK's agricultural potential and waste streams in the journey towards a greener, more resilient energy landscape.

Environmental permitting regulations

As biofuel production facilities become integral to this energy transition, navigating the complex landscape of environmental regulations is essential. Environmental permits serve as a safeguard, ensuring that operations meet the required standards for air, water, and soil quality. However, the process of obtaining these permits is intricate, requiring detailed documentation, technical expertise, and a thorough understanding of the regulatory environment.

The Environmental Permitting Regulations (EPR) 2016 (as amended) and similar devolved regulations require operators of specified activities to obtain and comply with the conditions of an environmental permit.

Once obtained, the environmental permit will contain conditions on management, operations, emissions & monitoring and record keeping/reporting. Monitoring of emissions, effluents, and other environmental parameters is often required to ensure ongoing compliance with permit conditions. This includes submitting regular reports to the relevant regulatory agencies and maintaining accurate records.

Key considerations:

Air pollution

Odour emissions: Biofuel facilities often handle odorous materials such as feedstock and run-off lagoons. If these sources are not adequately enclosed or treated, they can release unpleasant odours into the atmosphere, affecting local air quality and community well-being. Effective odour management strategies, including proper enclosure and treatment systems, are essential to mitigate this risk.

NOx and SOx emissions: The combustion of biogas in Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants or other combustion sources can release nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur oxides (SOx). These emissions contribute to air pollution, leading to respiratory issues and environmental degradation. Implementing advanced combustion technologies and emission control systems can help reduce these pollutants.

Ammonia emissions: Depending on the type of fuel and combustion efficiency, biofuel production can result in ammonia (NH3) emissions. Ammonia contributes to nitrogen deposition and acidification of ecosystems, which can harm plant and animal life. Monitoring and optimising combustion processes are crucial to minimise ammonia emissions.

Dust and particulate matter (PM): Dust can be generated from various stages of biofuel production, including feedstock handling, vehicle movement, and processing. The nature of the material and its moisture content can influence dust levels. Dust control measures, such as water sprays and dust suppressants, are necessary to prevent airborne particulate matter from affecting air quality and human health.

Bioaerosols: Bioaerosols are airborne particles that contain biological material, such as bacteria and fungi. These can be released during feedstock handling, especially when open sources are present, and from vented emissions. Inadequate abatement systems can exacerbate this risk. Proper ventilation and filtration systems are essential to control bioaerosol emissions.

Land pollution

Spills and leaks: The storage of raw materials, fuels, and processed biofuels poses a risk of spills and leaks. These incidents can contaminate the surrounding land, leading to soil degradation and potential harm to local ecosystems. To mitigate this risk, facilities must use bunded tanks that can contain 110% of the maximum capacity of the largest tank within the bund. Regular inspections and maintenance of storage infrastructure are also critical.

Hazardous by-products: The biofuel production process can generate hazardous by-products, including wastewater that may contain harmful substances. Proper treatment of process effluent on-site before discharge is necessary to prevent land contamination. Facilities must adhere to strict waste management protocols to handle and dispose of hazardous materials safely.

Water pollution

Run-off and effluent: Run-off from biofuel production sites can carry pollutants into nearby water bodies, affecting water quality and aquatic life. This includes run-off from feedstock storage areas and processing sites. Implementing effective run-off management practices, such as containment systems and treatment facilities, is essential to prevent water pollution.

Wastewater treatment: The production process generates wastewater that may contain organic and inorganic pollutants. This wastewater requires treatment before it can be safely discharged into sewers or surface water bodies. Advanced wastewater treatment systems are necessary to remove contaminants and ensure compliance with discharge regulations.

Operational noise: The equipment and processes used in biofuel production can generate significant noise, which could be disruptive to local communities. Permit applications may involve producing a Noise Impact Assessment and Noise Management Plan, as well as implementing noise reduction measures, such as soundproofing, operational limits, or buffer zones.

Waste management regulations: Biofuel production can generate by products and wastes, including spent biomass, ash, and chemical residues. Regulators will enforce compliance to ensure that by-products and wastes are properly classified, stored, and disposed of correctly.

Energy consumption: Biofuel production can be energy-intensive. BAT requirements may mean that facilities are required to implement an energy efficiency savings plan.

The government decided not to provide direct financial support, leaving 160 workers at Vivergo's Saltend-based plant facing redundancy, with layoffs set to begin on Monday. Ensus' plant in Redcar is also at risk of closure.

In a statement, a government spokesperson said: “We have worked closely with the companies since June to understand the financial challenges they have faced over the past decade, and have taken the difficult decision not to offer direct funding as it would not provide value for the taxpayer or solve the long-term problems the industry faces.”

Vivergo’s future was thrown into doubt after the U.K.-U.S. trade deal, announced in May, opened the door to 1.4 billion liters of tariff-free American ethanol — almost equivalent to the size of the entire domestic market.

The decision has wider implications for other industries and investment into Britain. Vivergo had been lined up to supply feedstock for a £1.25 billion sustainable aviation fuel facility backed by Meld Energy — a project now on hold. Over 12,000 U.K. wheat farmers supply Vivergo's plant, which also produces high-protein animal feed.

Meanwhile, Ensus, one of the U.K.’s only other bioethanol producers, supplies around 30 percent of the country’s commercial carbon dioxide — needed for soft drinks and medical use.

“We recognize this is a difficult time for the workers and their families and we will work with trade unions, local partners and the companies to support them through this process,” said the government spokesperson. “We also continue to work up proposals that ensure the resilience of our CO2 supply in the long-term in consultation with the sector.”

The decision will also prove unpopular with voters in Hull, with the Saltend chemical park just a 10-minute drive away.

Reform UK's Luke Campbell, who recently swept into office as Hull an East Yorkshire mayor with nearly 50,000 votes, told POLITICO: “Labour’s decision not to provide support, and not to change the clause in their U.S.-U.K. Trade deal is incredibly disappointing. It means job losses and closures for hard working people.”","https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/15/3372748-scaled.jpg",N,,2025-08-15 11:57:03.467693

As airlines grapple with the dual pressures of safety mandates and profitability, investors must discern which carriers and adjacent sectors are best positioned to thrive in this transformed landscape. Recent policy shifts—such as Emirates' power bank ban and the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) accessibility reforms—underscore a broader industry pivot toward risk mitigation and operational resilience. This article examines the financial implications of these changes for major carriers and identifies undervalued aviation-related stocks poised to capitalize on the new normal.

Regulatory Evolution: Safety as a Strategic Imperative

The past two years have seen a surge in safety-focused regulations, reflecting a global prioritization of passenger welfare and risk reduction. Emirates' 2025 power bank ban, for instance, is emblematic of a sector-wide response to lithium-ion battery risks. By prohibiting in-flight charging and restricting storage to accessible locations, Emirates aims to minimize thermal runaway incidents—a growing concern as portable electronics proliferate. This policy aligns with similar measures by Asian carriers and the UK Civil Aviation Authority, signaling a coordinated effort to address a systemic hazard.

Meanwhile, the U.S. DOT has intensified its focus on disability accommodations, enforcing the Final Rule on Ensuring Safe Accommodations for Air Travelers with Disabilities Using Wheelchairs. This regulation, which mandates improved training and infrastructure for wheelchair handling, has already triggered significant penalties for non-compliant carriers. American Airlines, for example, faced a $50 million fine for mishandling wheelchairs, while Lufthansa was penalized $4 million for discriminatory practices. These enforcement actions highlight the operational and reputational costs of regulatory missteps, compelling airlines to invest in compliance infrastructure.

Financial Implications: Compliance Costs and Margin Compression

The financial burden of these regulations is substantial. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) compliance costs will reach $1 billion in 2025, while Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) expenses are projected to add $4.8 billion to industry costs. SAF, which remains 4.2 times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, is a particular strain on carriers in Europe and Asia, where mandates like the EU's ReFuelEU Aviation policy demand aggressive blending targets.

These costs are eroding profit margins, which are expected to hover at 3.7% in 2025—up marginally from 3.4% in 2024 but still below the global industrial average. Airlines are passing these expenses to consumers through higher ticket prices, but this strategy risks further demand suppression in a market still recovering from pandemic-induced volatility. For instance, Spirit Airlines' recent Chapter 11 emergence and “going concern” warning illustrate the fragility of carriers unable to balance compliance costs with revenue growth.

Undervalued Opportunities: Beyond the Traditional Carrier Model

As traditional airlines struggle with regulatory and environmental headwinds, investors are increasingly turning to sectors with inherent resilience: digital rail, regional logistics, and digital travel platforms. These industries are not only adapting to regulatory pressures but also leveraging technology to redefine mobility and supply chain efficiency.

Digital Rail: A Sustainable Alternative to Air Travel

The global digital railway market, projected to grow from $83.74 billion in 2024 to $230.60 billion by 2034, is a prime example of this shift. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP), a leader in North American freight rail, has demonstrated robust operational resilience, with a 100-basis-point improvement in its operating ratio to 59.0% in Q2 2025. Its integration of AI and IoT for route optimization and predictive maintenance positions it as a key beneficiary of the post-pandemic shift toward sustainable infrastructure.

Regional Logistics: Powering E-Commerce Growth

The regional logistics sector, driven by e-commerce and urbanization, is another high-conviction area. FedEx (NYSE: FDX), for instance, has a Valuation Rating of B and a Due Diligence Score of 46—well above the logistics industry average. Its investments in electric delivery vehicles and AI-powered route planning have enhanced efficiency, with analysts projecting an 18.91% upside in its stock price. Similarly, ZTO Express (NYSE: ZTO), a dominant player in China's express delivery market, has leveraged automation and drone technology to expand its market share, achieving a 1.21% gain in 2025 despite sector-wide challenges.

Digital Travel Platforms: Integrating Mobility Solutions

Digital travel platforms are redefining consumer expectations by offering seamless, multimodal travel experiences. These platforms, which combine rail, regional air, and digital booking systems, are projected to capture 30% of the global travel market by 2030. Companies that integrate AI for real-time route optimization and dynamic pricing are particularly well-positioned to outperform traditional airlines, which face fare volatility and operational inefficiencies.

Investment Thesis: Balancing Risk and Resilience

For investors, the key lies in identifying assets that align with the long-term trajectory of the aviation ecosystem. While major carriers like Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) have shown valuation rebounds, their high uncertainty ratings and thin margins make them speculative plays. Conversely, undervalued stocks in rail and logistics—such as FedEx, ZTO Express, and Union Pacific—offer a more stable path to growth, supported by structural trends like decarbonization, urbanization, and digital transformation.

Conclusion: A New Paradigm for Aviation Investing

The post-pandemic aviation landscape is defined by regulatory scrutiny, environmental imperatives, and technological disruption. While traditional carriers face margin compression and compliance challenges, adjacent sectors are emerging as beacons of resilience. By prioritizing investments in digital rail, regional logistics, and integrated travel platforms, investors can hedge against the volatility of the airline sector while capitalizing on the next wave of innovation in global mobility. In this new paradigm, operational resilience—rather than mere cost-cutting—will be the cornerstone of sustainable value creation.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-15 12:57:39.102432

At 90 years old, Newcastle International Airport stands not at the end of an era, but at the beginning of its most exciting chapter yet.","Over the decades, Newcastle Airport has become far more than a place to catch a flight. It is a civic symbol, an economic powerhouse, and a deeply personal landmark for generations of people in the North East.

During my time as a board member, I was proud to help shape a vision that looked beyond the airport’s role as a transport hub. I believed then, and believe now, that Newcastle International should be seen as a civic anchor and a catalyst for the future; a place that doesn’t just move people, but drives progress.

It is, above all, a window to the world. From family holidays and new business ventures to academic journeys and emotional reunions, it is a place tied to countless moments that matter.

It is a window to the world. For so many people in the North East, it is the place where journeys begin and end. It is where first holidays took off, where businesses shook hands with global markets, where students left for the unknown and returned wiser, and where families embraced with relief, excitement, or longing. It is a place woven into the emotional map of millions of lives.

How many stories could be told by those who passed through this airport over the past 90 years? How many lives changed by a single journey? How many relationships, careers, or ideas were born from its departure lounge? This airport is part of our region’s story – but it also holds the stories of the people who make this region what it is.

Every gate and departure board holds a million stories.

Today, the airport connects us to over 80 destinations through 16 airline partners, with onward links to more than 325 cities worldwide. It handled more than 5.1 million passengers in 2024, making it the 11th busiest airport in the UK. It’s consistently among the most efficient too – 98% of travellers clear security in under ten minutes.

Importantly, and a clear indication of the calibre of the team running the airport, it has also become a recognised leader in the aviation world. In 2024, Newcastle International was named Overall Winner at the Routes World Awards in Bahrain – the first UK airport ever to receive that honour – and also won UK & Ireland Airport of the Year from the Travel Trade Gazette. These aren’t just awards – they’re proof that a regional airport, owned by and for its region, can lead with pride on the global stage.

More than £20 million has been invested into terminal upgrades, including a fully refurbished departure lounge, next-generation security systems, and the world’s first three-tier Aspire Lounge. But what’s most important is what this investment represents: confidence – in the airport, in the region, and in the people it serves.

And yet, the most exciting part of Newcastle International’s story is not what it has achieved, but what lies ahead.

Newcastle airport: a low-carbon future

The airport is now a central partner in developing the North East Green Superport; what could be a transformational project to integrate air, sea, rail, and road to create a low-carbon logistics and freight network. This isn’t just a port strategy – it’s a new model for regional economic development, rooted in sustainability, innovation, and inclusion. The airport’s role within this network will go far beyond passengers. It will serve as a strategic export hub, connecting regional manufacturing, green energy, and innovation sectors to global markets.

This vision also aligns with the airport’s firm commitment to achieving Net Zero by 2035. This is a target underpinned by serious action: electrifying ground operations, investing in sustainable aviation fuel, and collaborating with universities and tech partners on aviation decarbonisation. Aviation must be part of the climate solution, and Newcastle is stepping forward to prove that it can be.

Newcastle airport: a public asset

What makes Newcastle International so exceptional is that it is owned by us – by the people of this region. Through our local authorities, we have a stake in its success. That means its profits, priorities, and plans are not dictated from afar but shaped by local needs and local people.

It is rooted in public purpose. Its profits are reinvested. Its priorities reflect regional needs. It is accountable not only to passengers, but to the communities of Newcastle, Gateshead, Sunderland, Durham, Northumberland, and South Tyneside.

Looking ahead, I’m sure the airport will continue to play a leading role – not just in infrastructure or transport, but in telling the story of the North East to the world. Championing cultural exports, opening new trade routes, supporting creative industries, attracting inward investment, and inspiring the next generation to see the world as theirs to shape.

It means being bolder than ever: investing in green aviation innovation, becoming a testbed for regional skills and careers, supporting inclusive growth, and ensuring that the people who live near the airport also benefit from its success – in jobs, education, and opportunity.

At 90 years old, Newcastle International Airport stands not at the end of an era, but at the beginning of its most exciting chapter yet.

African Gen Z isn’t just laughing.","If you’re African and online, chances are your first taste of politics came not from a news broadcast, but from a meme.

A screenshot. A freeze-frame. A line of text in Impact font. Maybe it made you laugh, then made you think. Maybe it made you mad enough to post, to protest, to speak. Across the continent, memes have emerged as one of Gen Z’s sharpest weapons against injustice, a digital dialect of rebellion where punchlines deliver punches to power.

Say goodbye to long speeches and manifestoes. Welcome to Africa’s meme wars, where humor is resistance, virality is visibility, and Gen Z doesn’t just witness history, they remix it. Memes, once considered funny internet detritus, have become tools of socio-political commentary in African digital life.

During the 2020 Nigeria #EndSARS protests against police brutality, memes took the place of protest banners. Stringing together viral images of a cartoon SpongeBob designed as a Nigerian protester, phrases like ‘Soro Soke’ (‘speak up’ in Yoruba) became a meme, a slogan, but overall a movement. The digital rebellion moved into the streets and, in time, government crosshairs.

In Sudan, as young people protested the military’s grip on power, memes comparing the generals to outdated phone apps or expired milk flooded WhatsApp groups. The goal? To ridicule the regime and rally the masses without triggering heavy-handed crackdowns.

In Kenya, Gen Z memes recently took on a historic role during the 2024 Finance Bill protests. A widely shared meme showed a stock photo of a lion captioned: ‘When the government realizes Gen Zs read more PDFs than they thought.’ Another showed a politician trying to ‘block’ a protester, only to be digitally photoshopped out by a cartoon eraser.

Meme Activism across the continent

Let’s take a minute to take stock of just how Gen Z is mobilizing for justice through memes. When it came to the 2021 elections, social media was flooded with memes satirizing President Yoweri Museveni’s long rule. One viral image showed Museveni as the ‘admin’ of an old, dusty WhatsApp group titled ‘Presidents Since 1986.’

During 2021’s July unrest, memes emerged both to criticize looting and highlight racial inequality. One depicted a white-owned mall labeled ‘protected’ and a township with ‘forgotten’ pasted over it.

In the wake of Egypt’s Arab Spring fallout, memes have quietly persisted. Satirical pages like El Koshary Today use humor to critique the military regime without triggering arrests, walking a dangerous line.

Gen Zs aren’t waiting for mainstream media to report the story. They become the media. A meme produced in Nairobi is now reposted in Accra, reshared in Kigali, and moments later creates a protest in Kinshasa.

Most meme-makers occupy anonymity. They are operating behind burner accounts and encrypted apps. This is digital guerilla warfare, creative, chaotic, and deeply political. And while some elders scoff at memes as ‘childish,’ these same graphics are turning into flashpoints for reform.

Just ask President Ruto from Kenya who was the target of thousands of meme-based critiques during the 2024 tax protests. The memes became so popular that mainstream media started airing and referencing them in their coverage, forcing policy exemplars to include them in their discussions.

Meme activism in Africa isn’t all fun and punchlines and meme pages have been linked to arrests. In Nigeria, authorities monitor social media for ‘cybercrime’ under vague laws. Several meme creators have faced threats, digital surveillance, or doxxing.

And with the rise of AI-generated memes, governments are tightening their grip on misinformation laws, sometimes using that as an excuse to suppress dissent. The meme wars may be hilarious, but they are fought under real risk.

In a continent where democratic backsliding and youth suppression are rampant, memes are offering a lifeline to resistance, a bridge between information and emotion, between power and the powerless. African Gen Z isn’t just laughing. They’re organizing. They’re calling out hypocrisy while expressing it in the language they are fluent in, the language of memes.",https://thred.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AFRICA-MEMES.png,N,,2025-08-15 11:57:55.109531

Post-pandemic trade patterns, coupled with stricter emission regulations, are forcing cargo operators, airlines, and logistics companies to innovate faster than ever before.

Innovation Takes Flight

Modern air cargo hubs are embracing automation, artificial intelligence, and blockchain to streamline operations. AI algorithms now optimise cargo space, predict demand surges, and track shipments in real time, reducing delays and costs.

Blockchain-enabled platforms ensure transparency in the supply chain, making it harder for counterfeit goods to slip through.

Air freight Rates Hold Steady As They Go Through Turbulence

Meanwhile, drones and autonomous aircraft are becoming viable for short-haul and last-mile cargo delivery. These innovations are particularly valuable for urgent medical supplies, high-value electronics, and critical parts in remote locations.

Sustainability Becomes a Business Imperative

The environmental footprint of air cargo has long been under scrutiny. With aviation contributing nearly 2% of global CO₂ emissions, the sector is now under pressure to decarbonise. Airlines and cargo operators are investing in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which can cut lifecycle emissions by up to 80%.

Companies like DHL, FedEx, and Emirates SkyCargo are experimenting with electric and hybrid aircraft, while others are testing lightweight packaging and optimised flight paths to reduce fuel burn.

Governments and industry bodies, including IATA, have set ambitious goals to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, pushing carriers to accelerate their green transitions.

Technology Meets Regulation

Regulatory frameworks are evolving to encourage greener operations. Carbon offset schemes, tax incentives for SAF adoption, and stricter emissions reporting are becoming standard.

In parallel, digital customs clearance systems are reducing paperwork and expediting cross-border trade, improving efficiency and cutting idle times at airports—a subtle but significant sustainability gain.

The Road (and Sky) Ahead

The next decade will likely see a blending of sustainability and technology as the industry’s competitive edge. Electric cargo planes could dominate regional routes, while AI-driven predictive maintenance will make fleets more reliable and energy-efficient.

For cargo operators, staying relevant will mean investing in greener fleets, smarter logistics, and transparent operations.

The Way Forward

Air cargo is no longer just about speed—it’s about smart, sustainable, and responsible growth. The industry is undergoing a transformation that aligns profitability with environmental stewardship.

By embracing innovation and sustainability together, the sector can ensure that future trade flows as smoothly through green skies as it does through global markets.",https://media.assettype.com/transportandlogisticsme%2F2025-08-15%2Fmppbafpa%2FAir-Cargo.png?rect=0%2C0%2C1536%2C806&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-08-15 11:58:05.197455

Together, we explored evolving market trends, global risks, and long‑term strategic opportunities.

Senior leadership from RGE shared how the group is expanding its global footprint, diversifying across regions and sectors, and expanding into adjacent growth areas to drive sustainable, profitable growth. These efforts are guided by disciplined execution and a long‑term mindset.

Global Leadership across Core Segments

Royal Golden Eagle (RGE) is a leader in bio‑based resources and energy, operating across more than 100 markets worldwide. It is the world’s largest producer of dissolving pulp, viscose, and lyocell, and consistently ranks among the top three global producers of paperboard, printing and writing paper, and market pulp. RGE also ranks second globally in palm oil refining. These positions stem from disciplined vertical integration and strategic investments, including the acquisitions of Vinda in China and Origami in India, making RGE a leading consumer tissue producer in both markets.

Since the inaugural Bankers’ Forum in 2019, RGE’s assets have more than doubled, successfully delivering large‑scale international projects. Notably, we are developing the world’s first net‑zero LNG export facility in Canada and Southern Europe’s largest second-generation biofuels plant in Spain.

Integrated, Diversified Portfolio and Future Preparedness

RGE’s five core verticals – pulp and paper; dissolving and specialty pulp; textile fibres; palm oil; and energy – cover upstream assets like plantations and gas fields through to downstream products such as tissue, garments, biodiesel, and electricity. This integrated value chain ensures quality control, cost competitiveness, and environmental governance. Strategic diversification into adjacent growth areas including solar energy, sustainable aviation fuel, and B2C consumer products provides additional synergy and growth pathways.

With recent major projects nearing completion, RGE is well-positioned for continued growth despite global uncertainties, including volatility from US tariffs and shifting supply chain dynamics. We remain committed to disciplined execution, agility, and preserving margins through brand strength.

Strategic Vision for the New Global Environment

RGE President Tey Wei Lin shared insights on the importance of supply chain diversification, flexible business models, and scenario planning to navigate geopolitics and trade protectionism. He underscored that strong future leadership requires balancing long‑term vision with agile near‑term execution – “think harder, react faster”.

Wei Lin summarised RGE’s future growth directions:

Strengthen leadership in core upstream sectors and expand selectively downstream.

Grow B2C tissue and personal care business by leveraging our leading brands.

Pivot to green energy, including sustainable aviation fuel and solar, leveraging our competitive advantages and strong partnerships.

As Managing Director Belinda Tanoto emphasised in her closing remarks, we are guided by our 5Cs operating philosophy – that what we do must be good for the Community, Country, Climate, Customer and only then will it be good for the Company. RGE’s global ambitions are anchored in partnerships – particularly with our banking and financial community – as we aim to deliver profitable growth with sustainability at its core.",https://www.inside-rge.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bankers-forum_3.png,N,,2025-08-15 04:56:08.700906

Also drawing skepticism is the Brightmark Plastics plant in Ashley, Indiana.
“The company never managed to get the plant up and running at commercial scale and filed for bankruptcy in March,” notes the advocacy group.
“In May, the company bought itself back at auction with the hope of keeping the facility operational,” adds the organization.","The Washington-based Environmental Integrity Project, in a mid-August online article posted to its Oil & Gas Watch website, says it has identified nine operating plastics chemical recycling plants in the United States, although numerous others are under construction or have been proposed.

The organization contrasts the nine operating plants with what it calls “a flurry of ambitious announcements” about plastics recycling facilities that will deploy processes including pyrolysis, gasification, solvolysis and solvent-based purification collectively known as chemical recycling or advanced recycling.

A list posted within the article lists three plants under construction and another 19 that have been proposed. A separate map, also included on the article page, displays about three dozen facilities, including some of the under construction and proposed ones. Nine others are identified as operating and 10 others described as “canceled [or] shut down.”

The text of the Oil & Gas Watch article focuses on idled facilities, including the Regenyx facility in Tigard, Oregon, described as having reached just 40 percent of its designed capacity and has having “sustained operating losses of $22.4 million in 2020 and 2021.”

The organization also describes the Fulcrum BioEnergy waste-to-jet fuel plant in Nevada as having “struggled to keep operations running consistently” the company as having failed to repay government bonds. “It was shut down in May 2024 after operating for only two years [and] Fulcrum filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September of last year, canceling projects it planned to develop in Indiana and Texas,” writes Alexandra Shaykevich of Oil & Gas Watch.

Also drawing skepticism is the Brightmark Plastics plant in Ashley, Indiana. “The company never managed to get the plant up and running at commercial scale and filed for bankruptcy in March,” notes the advocacy group.

The Environmental Integrity Project, citing Plastics News, says the bankruptcy filing showed the Ashley plant was only operating at 5 percent capacity and, as of 2023, had processed around 2,000 tons of plastic scrap in total. “In May, the company bought itself back at auction with the hope of keeping the facility operational,” adds the organization.

While in its report the Environmental Integrity Project quotes a researcher who describes all plastic recycling as ineffective, packaging, recycled materials and waste handling companies—as well as some plastics producers—around the world have continued to invest in mechanical recycling projects that have tended be based on longer term return on investment calculations.",https://www.wastetodaymagazine.com/fileuploads/image/2025/08/15/plasticshredding_cvb.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 04:56:16.751773

RI Challenged To Scientifically Prove Biodiesel As Clean Energy.","JAKARTA – Indonesia is facing a big challenge to prove that palm oil-based biodiesel is not just a slogan of reducing carbon emissions, but it is truly a sustainable energy solution that can be objectively and scientifically measured.

Edi Wibowo, Director of Bioenergy at the ministry of energy and mineral resources (KESDM) said the credibility of Indonesian biodiesel depends on the capacity to show real and measurable impacts to the reduction of carbon emissions.

“Now, it’s not the time to talk about claims that biodiesel is ecofriendly. We have to prove it scientifically that our palm-based biodiesel is truly sustainable and can compete globally,” Edi told participants of the 10th international conference of Biomass and Bioenergy (ICBB) in Bogor, West Java, on Monday (04/08/2025).

Indonesia’s mandatory program of biodiesel has been claimed to have reduced carbon emissions. The biodiesel 35 percent (B35) program alone is claimed to have reduced emissions up to 34 million tons of CO₂ equivalent per year. “But amid the global pressures on environment and deforestation, such claim needs to be supported by field data, transparancy of supply chain, and recognition from international institutions,” he said.

The Head of Surfactant and Bioenergy Research Center (SBRC), Meika Syahbana RuslI emphasized the importance of synergy between scientists, industrial players, and regulators. “Without collaborations, the green energy transition cannot be achieved and it will be just rethoric,” said Meika.

During the conference, the issue of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) or bioavtur for airplanes was also discussed by speakers and participants.

Although the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has given a positive sign of support for the production of SAF based on palm oil and the used cooking oil (UCO), the production of SAF is still facing big challenges in terms of technical aspects, investments, and market acceptability.

Indonesia has abundant source of wastes and palm oil derivative products that can be used as raw material for production of SAF. But such big potential can be just dormant without the support of research activities, funding and adaptive policies from the government.

The Head of Services Division at the Oil Palm Plantation Fund Management Board (BPDPKS), Arfie Thahar, said that his institution is now accelerating the integration of technological research, public policies, and global access.

“If we want our biodiesel and bio-avtur products accepted at the global market, we have to implement a thorough improvement from the level of farmers to the tanks of vehicles. We cannot just rely on the green narrative alone,” said Arfie.

Amid the global pressures on environment and domestic need for clean energy, Indonesia is now entering a crucial point to prove that palm oil-based biodiesel can really become a clean energy product of the future, and not just a biofuel with full of controversy. (*)
