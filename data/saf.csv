Ethanol Market

Dublin, Jan. 23, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Ethanol Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2021-2031"" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Ethanol Market is projected to expand from USD 96.35 Billion in 2025 to USD 128.61 Billion by 2031, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 4.93%. The enforcement of strict biofuel blending mandates and policy frameworks acts as a primary catalyst for the industry's structural growth, with governments increasingly requiring higher ethanol integration rates in gasoline to support national decarbonization strategies and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels.

According to the Press Information Bureau's October 2024 update on the 'Ethanol Blended Petrol Programme,' the ethanol blending percentage in India climbed to 15.8% in August 2024. This regulatory consistency encourages producers to scale their operations and guarantees long-term demand, prompting oil marketing companies to invest significantly in the necessary storage and distribution infrastructure to meet these advancing targets.

Concurrently, emerging applications in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) are establishing a high-value diversification channel for the market, as the aviation sector adopts ethanol-to-jet technologies to meet net-zero goals with a scalable, low-carbon alternative to traditional jet fuel. According to LanzaJet's January 2024 press release regarding 'Freedom Pines Fuels,' the company opened the world's first ethanol-to-SAF production plant with an annual capacity of 10 million gallons. To support this rising industrial consumption, feedstock availability is increasing in key regions; according to Conab in October 2024, Brazil's total corn production is anticipated to hit 119.7 million tons for the 2024-25 cycle, ensuring ample raw materials for the country's rapidly growing corn ethanol industry.

Market Challenges

The global ethanol market faces considerable hurdles driven by the volatility of feedstock prices and the inherent unpredictability of agricultural yields. Because the industry relies heavily on biomass sources such as corn and sugarcane, it is uniquely susceptible to environmental conditions, where adverse weather can cause sudden fluctuations in crop output, leading to supply constraints and sharp increases in raw material costs. This instability fosters a challenging financial environment in which producers struggle to forecast operating margins or commit to consistent production schedules, thereby discouraging long-term investment and impeding the industry's ability to maintain a stable growth trajectory.

This vulnerability is clearly illustrated by recent production data. According to the Brazilian Sugarcane Industry Association (UNICA), cumulative ethanol production in Brazil's Center-South region reached 23.02 billion liters by mid-October 2025, marking an 8.8% decrease compared to the same period in the previous harvest cycle. Such a contraction in output, resulting from feedstock processing limitations, demonstrates how agricultural variability can directly restrict market expansion and disrupt the reliability of global supply chains.

Market Trends

The strategic adoption of Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) is fundamentally reshaping the ethanol landscape as producers aim to reduce carbon intensity (CI) scores to qualify for premium tax incentives and fulfill net-zero pledges. Departing from traditional volume-based blending mandates, this trend emphasizes decarbonizing the production process itself, effectively converting biorefineries into carbon-negative assets capable of competing in low-carbon fuel markets. This structural shift is demonstrated by a surge in planned infrastructure projects intended to aggregate and sequester emissions from fermentation; according to a February 2025 Carbon Pulse article, 51 CCS projects were in the planning stages across the US by late 2024, targeting the sequestration of at least 30.5 million tonnes of CO2 annually from ethanol facilities.

At the same time, the market is experiencing increased diversification into bio-ethylene and bioplastic feedstocks, reducing the industry's exclusive reliance on the transportation fuel sector. Producers are increasingly upgrading ethanol into green ethylene, a vital precursor for renewable plastics, to address the growing global demand for sustainable packaging and circular economy solutions. This application allows manufacturers to hedge against fuel demand volatility while entering high-margin petrochemical supply chains that require non-fossil carbon sources; according to a May 2025 press release by Braskem celebrating 15 years of its 'I'm green' line, the company's green ethylene production capacity in Brazil reached 275,000 tons per year following a major facility expansion.

A new study produced for two Iowa agri-business groups predicts that demand gap will continue to grow.

Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, says an oversupply of corn will drag down prices for farmers unless something changes.

“As is usual, we’re outproducing our markets, and so, there’s really three paths forward,” Shaw says. “There’s the status quo where supply continues to go up faster than demand.”

Mark Mueller, president of the Iowa Corn Growers Association and a fourth-generation farmer from Waverly, says he’s worried there won’t be a fifth generation on his family’s land.

Mueller says, “The bottom line is that we have high input prices, we have low commodity prices, and we’re producing more corn all the time. We need more places to move our corn.”

Based in the Caofeidian Petrochemical Industry Base, it is set to break ground in second half of 2026, with start-up targeted for second half of 2028.

Topsoe, a leading global provider of advanced technology and solutions for the energy transition, has been selected technology provider by the Tangshan Jinlihai Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Tangshan Jinlihai), a developer and provider of renewable fuels. Topsoe will provide its Hydroflex® technology and related services for Tangshan Jinlihai industrial hub with a capacity 300,000 tons of feedstock annually.

When the project is in full operation, Topsoe’s technology is expected to enable an annual emission avoidance of approximately 700,000 metric tons of CO2e – the equivalent of avoiding the emissions from approximately two million passengers flying from Beijing to Copenhagen[1].

Yassir Ghiyati, Chief Commercial Officer at Topsoe, said:

“We are delighted to announce our collaboration with Tangshan Jinlihai, a partnership that reflects our shared commitment to advancing sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel. By applying Topsoe’s proven technologies, we are enabling customers to move closer to their decarbonization goals while supporting efforts to reduce emissions across both China and Europe, making the energy transition truly global.”

Aijun Li, Chairman of Tangshan Jinlihai said:

“Jinlihai and Topsoe have jointly launched the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project, marking a crucial step forward for us in the strategic layout of high-end green energy and the active practice of new quality productivity. The project will fully leverage the geographical and industrial advantages of the Caofeidian National Petrochemical Base, using waste oil as feedstock and using Topsoe's globally leading technology to build a high-quality SAF production. This is not only a substantive measure for Jinlihai to extend its green industrial chain, but also an important action for us to respond to China’s ""dual carbon"" strategy and promote the low-carbon transformation of the aviation industry.”

The agreement addresses the growing global demand for SAF. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects that SAF production will have more than doubled in 2025 compared to 2024, reaching 2.1 million tons (2.7 billion liters), or 0.7% of total global jet fuel production [2]. To stay on track for net zero by 2050, the International Energy Agency’s Net Zero Scenario suggests that over 10% of fuel consumption in aviation needs to be SAF by 2030.

The project is located in the Caofeidian Petrochemical Industry Base, Tangshan, Hebei province. With a planned investment of approximately USD 210 million, construction is expected to commence in second half of 2026, and operations due to start in second half of 2028.

This agreement builds on Topsoe’s growing SAF-presence in China and marks its sixth contract for production of SAF in the nation to date. Most recently it was announced that Topsoe will provide technology, proprietary equipment and catalysts to Zhongneng Yida New Energy Co., Ltd in May 2025, Zhejiang Jianglan Bio-Energy Technology Co. Ltd in April 2025, Chuangui New Energy Company in January 2025 and Guangxi Hongkun Biomass in April 2024.

Hello!

Today’s newsletter focuses on the key environmental, social and governance points that cropped up during the World Economic Forum annual gathering at Davos this week.

They range from a poll on Davos attendees’ priorities this year to U.S. President Donald Trump’s comments on ESG issues.

But before we dive into the WEF survey results, here are some stories on what industry leaders are saying at Davos:

Climate risks slip down the rankings

Environmental risks slipped down the rankings from last year, the survey found, as other issues came to the fore - notably worries over the long-term consequences of weak governance of artificial intelligence.

The WEF says its annual survey draws on responses from ""over 1,300 global leaders and experts from academia, business, government, international organizations and civil society"".

Saadia Zahidi, managing director of the WEF annual gathering in Davos, cited rising tariffs, checks on foreign investment and tighter supply controls on resources like critical minerals as examples of ""geoeconomic confrontation"", which ranked as the top risk.

Perceived risks around extreme weather over the next two years dropped from 2nd to 4th place and pollution from 6th to 9th. Anxiety over critical change to earth systems and biodiversity loss fell seven and five positions respectively.

However, when asked what their sharpest concerns were over a longer, 10-year period, those same respondents ranked such environmental concerns in the top three spots.

""I want to see Europe go good”

Now let’s turn to the comments from Trump’s speech to business and world leaders.

He sharply criticized his predecessor Joe Biden and policies that have dominated at Davos for years, from climate change to diversity.

Former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who served under Biden, visibly winced as he listened.

Trump promised to reduce inflation with a mix of tariffs, deregulation and tax cuts along with his crackdown on illegal immigration and commitment to making the United States a hub of artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies and fossil fuels.

""The United States has the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth, and we're going to use it,"" Trump said. ""Not only will this reduce the cost of virtually all goods and services, it will make the United States a manufacturing superpower.""

""I want to see Europe go good, but it's not heading in the right direction.""

He said a focus on green energy and mass migration were factors that had hurt Europe, without citing evidence.

""We're very much into the world of nuclear energy, and we can have it now at good prices and very, very safe.""

""I want Europe to do great. I want UK to do great. Sitting on one of the greatest energy sources in the world, and they don't use it,"" he said.

Clean air boast contradicts data

Trump also repeated his regular criticism of wind power, taking aim at China when he said the country made almost all of the windmills but he had not ""been able to find any wind farms in China"", characterizing China's buyers as ""stupid"".

China defended its wind power record and reinforced its commitment to promote the global transition to low-carbon energy. China is also the world's leading producer of wind power.

Trump also said the U.S. had the cleanest air and water during his first term and that there was a ""Green New Deal"" in the United States that he had repealed.

This is not backed up by data. Only seven countries met the World Health Organization (WHO) air quality standards last year and the United States was not one of them. According to Swiss air quality monitoring firm IQAir, the U.S. ranks as the 22nd cleanest country (or 117th most polluted) globally.

Since taking office, Trump has withdrawn the United States from the World Health Organization and the Paris climate agreement.

Trump is moving to dismantle diversity programs within the U.S. government and is pressuring the private sector to do so as well. That has left some in Davos searching for new words to describe workplace practices that they say are essential to their businesses.

In Conversation

War Child Alliance's CEO Rob Williams shares what he's seeing at Davos this year as ‘conflict’ rises to the top of the WEF agenda:

“Right now, one in five children globally – 520 million – are growing up in conflict zones. This isn’t a distant humanitarian issue; it’s a warning sign of deepening global instability that political and business leaders cannot afford to ignore.

“In Gaza, over 20,000 children have been killed, and more than a million survivors are living with severe psychological trauma.

“In Sudan, five million children have been forced to flee their homes, with four in five now out of school amid widespread grave violations of children’s rights.

“From Iran to Venezuela, we're seeing children's rights hanging in the balance as instability and conflict rages.

“We are working hard with our local partners to reach children in countries affected, but aid cuts are making this harder to achieve than ever before.

“I can see in Davos an awareness that if philanthropists and corporates tackle something together with NGOs they can make a big difference.

“What is missing is the leadership that was previously provided by governments who have in the past come to Davos with a broadly shared agenda on big issues like climate change.

“The fracture in global politics leaves others feeling like they can’t count on governments to be a predictable partner on global challenges. Political leadership is missing from this Davos.”

ESG Spotlight

Today’s spotlight shines a light on Ukraine veterans using theater to find healing and fulfillment.

Reuters followed the group, called Veterans’ Theatre, as they prepared for an avant-garde performance of an 18th-century Ukrainian parody of Virgil’s Aeneid.

Russia’s war, now entering its fifth year, has left countless Ukrainian soldiers wounded, with tens of thousands suffering one or more amputations.

As a theater-nerd myself, I found this piece deeply moving and its images were incredibly powerful, so do give this feature a read.

Transcript

So how legit is sustainable aviation fuel or staff when it comes to reducing the carbon footprint of flying? Well, staff is a lower emission replacement for fossil fuel. It's not made from crude oil, but from renewable raw materials such as used cooking oil. For instance, although burning self generates mission, it does not add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere like fossil jet fuel does. Instead, it recycles carbon dioxide that's already there in the atmosphere. As a result, staff can reduce the greenhouse gas emissions. By up to 80% over the fuel life cycle compared to fossil jet fuel, and that's significant and legit impact.

Currently, E15 sales are restricted during the summer months because of air quality rules.
As part of a compromise, lawmakers plan to set up an “E15 Rural Domestic Energy Council” to study issues including E15 sales, U.S. refining capacity, and biofuel blending credits.
Democratic Representative Nikki Budzinski of Illinois also criticised the move, saying there had been a bipartisan agreement with industry support to allow year-round E15 sales, but lawmakers dropped it in favour of setting up a task force.","Washington: U S lawmakers are planning to set up a task force dedicated to study viability of sale of E15 gasoline throughout the year in the country, reports Reuters.

The decision was taken after the government failed to pass the legislation in a funding bill this week.

The move has drawn sharp criticism from farm groups and ethanol supporters in the Midwest, who said creating a task force instead of passing a law is a setback for farmers already dealing with low prices, uncertain global trade, and unclear biofuel policies.

Farm organisations are seeking year-round sales of E15 fuel, which contains more ethanol than the widely sold E10 gasoline. Supporters say this would raise demand for corn, the main crop used to produce ethanol. Oil refiners have opposed higher ethanol blending in the past, citing higher costs. Currently, E15 sales are restricted during the summer months because of air quality rules.

As part of a compromise, lawmakers plan to set up an “E15 Rural Domestic Energy Council” to study issues including E15 sales, U.S. refining capacity, and biofuel blending credits. The council is expected to submit its recommendations by mid-February, according to a draft proposal reviewed by Reuters. A vote on the measure was expected as early as Thursday afternoon.

Renewable Fuels Association President and Chief Executive Officer Geoff Cooper said the decision to delay action would increase uncertainty across rural areas, adding that farmers need clear policies rather than further reviews.

Democratic Representative Nikki Budzinski of Illinois also criticised the move, saying there had been a bipartisan agreement with industry support to allow year-round E15 sales, but lawmakers dropped it in favour of setting up a task force.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ethanol-fuel-10.png,N,,2026-01-23 10:37:47.478160

Noam says: “By purchasing SAF as part of its sustainability roadmap, AVEVA continues to show leadership and make meaningful progress toward the fulfillment of its FMC aviation target.
Through the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) COP30 procurement initiative, AVEVA reduced the climate impact associated with its COP30 flights.","Industrial software provider AVEVA has completed its first major purchase of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) certificates. This strategic procurement move helps bring the company in line with fulfilling its World Economic Forum (WEF) First Movers Coalition (FMC) commitment.

Notably, this milestone has been reached five years ahead of its schedule. AVEVA joins other leading companies who are investing in sustainable fuels to support the transition to a cleaner future.

As a member of the WEF FMC Aviation group, AVEVA set a target to replace at least 5% of conventional jet fuel demand with SAF. To execute this strategy, it purchased SAF certificates from British Airways for use at London Heathrow Airport.

British Airways had entered into a multi-year agreement with renewable fuel provider EcoCeres. According to the airline, this agreement acts as a mechanism supporting the airline’s goal to power 10% of its flights with SAF by 2030.

EcoCeres specialises in producing industrial-scale SAF, hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and renewable naphtha. In a display of circular supply chain dynamics, AVEVA’s software is also used by EcoCeres. The technology is being used to optimise the production of SAF.

Leveraging purchasing power

Caspar Herzberg, CEO of AVEVA, says: “The role of tech and industry in driving decarbonisation has never been clearer.”

“By investing in sustainable fuels today, we are demonstrating how climate ambition must be matched by concrete action.”

He further elaborates on the impact of such procurement decisions on the wider industry. Caspar says: “Through concerted action like this, industries can scale new technologies, minimise lifecycle emissions and set a higher standard for responsible growth.”

The First Movers Coalition is an initiative launched by the WEF and the US government at COP26. Its primary objective is to help decarbonise heavy industry and transport.

These sectors are responsible for 30% of global emissions. Consequently, the initiative aims to leverage the collective purchasing power of its members.

Accelerating market demand

The FMC’s mission is to accelerate the adoption of emerging climate technologies. This is intended to build early market demand and encourage their widespread commercial adoption.

At its inception in 2021, the FMC had 35 members. This number has since grown to more than 100 members who have collectively made more than 125 commitments.

The members of the coalition aim to work together and use their power to decarbonise industry sectors. These sectors include aviation, cement and concrete, shipping, steel, trucking and aluminium.

Noam Boussidan, Programme Head for the First Movers Coalition at WEF, says: “It is great to see First Movers Coalition members in action today.”

Noam highlights the progress made by the software company through its buying decisions. Noam says: “By purchasing SAF as part of its sustainability roadmap, AVEVA continues to show leadership and make meaningful progress toward the fulfillment of its FMC aviation target.

“Partnerships like these demonstrate how First Movers Coalition members are supporting the development and use of cleaner aviation technology while driving corporate climate action.”

Reducing operational emissions

AVEVA is focused on advancing its sustainability commitment through action. This includes reducing its Scope 1 and 2 operational emissions by more than 93%. Furthermore, the company is on track to achieve its target of cutting Scope 3 emissions by 50% by 2030.

More than 20,000 enterprises across 100 countries rely on AVEVA’s software to help deliver reliable energy, food, infrastructure and medicines. Its software allows companies to access trusted information and AI insights.

This integration could mean teams can engineer efficiently and optimise operations while meeting their sustainability goals. By providing these tools, the company supports the wider industrial ecosystem in its transition toward net-zero.

Through the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) COP30 procurement initiative, AVEVA reduced the climate impact associated with its COP30 flights. This commitment demonstrates the company’s leadership in advancing market-based solutions for global decarbonisation.

Such initiatives highlight the importance of addressing Scope 3 emissions, which often represent the largest share of a company’s carbon footprint.

The $210m project will use waste oil as feedstock to produce SAF at the Caofeidian National Petrochemical Base in Tangshan, Hebei Province. It is expected to enable the avoidance of around 700,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year.

Topsoe’s Hydroflex technology turns feedstocks such as used cooking oil or vegetable oils into drop-in renewable diesel and jet fuel. For this project, the technology will process up to 300,000 tonnes of feedstock each year.

The process uses hydrogen at high temperatures and pressures in a catalytic reactor to remove oxygen from feedstocks, making the resulting fuels chemically identical to petroleum products.

“By applying [our] proven technologies, we are enabling customers to move closer to their decarbonisation goals while supporting efforts to reduce emissions across both China and Europe,” said Tassir Ghiyati, chief commercial officer at Topsoe.

The project marks Topsoe’s sixth contract for SAF production in China to date. Construction is set to begin in the second half of 2026, with operations due to start in the second half of 2028.

Challenges remain

While projects such as this highlight growing investment momentum, SAF still represents well under 1% of global aviation fuel consumption today, reflecting the scale and cost challenges facing the sector.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF production was expected to more than double in 2025 compared to 2024, reaching around 2.1 million tonnes, compared with roughly 300 million tonnes of total annual jet fuel demand.

To stay on track for net zero by 2050, the International Energy Agency Net Zero Scenario suggests that more than 10% of aviation fuel consumption will need to be SAF by 2030, underlining the gap between current output and longer-term targets.

IATA revealed in December that SAF production growth is projected to slow, reaching around 2.4 million tonnes in 2026.

Director General Willie Walsh said policymakers need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that effectively address cost barriers and support further SAF deployment.

Although domestic demand in China remains modest, producers are increasingly targeting export markets. Capacity in the country is expected to surpass Europe by 2025, supported by more than 40 active or planned projects.

The company has entered into an agreement with Tangshan Jinlihai Biotechnology Co., Ltd., a developer and supplier of renewable fuels, to supply its proprietary Hydroflex® technology along with related engineering and technical services.

Under the agreement, Topsoe will deliver its Hydroflex® technology to Tangshan Jinlihai’s planned industrial hub, which is designed to process approximately 300,000 tons of feedstock per year. The facility will primarily utilize waste oils as raw materials, converting them into sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel. By using advanced conversion technology and sustainable feedstocks, the project aims to significantly lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared with conventional fossil-based jet fuels.

Once fully operational, the facility is expected to deliver substantial environmental benefits. According to project estimates, the use of Topsoe’s technology could enable the avoidance of around 700,000 metric tons of CO2-equivalent emissions annually. This reduction is comparable to eliminating the emissions generated by roughly two million passengers flying long-haul routes between Beijing and Copenhagen, illustrating the scale of the project’s climate impact.

Commenting on the collaboration, Yassir Ghiyati, Chief Commercial Officer at Topsoe, emphasized the strategic importance of the partnership. He noted that working with Tangshan Jinlihai demonstrates a shared commitment to accelerating the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel. By applying proven and scalable technologies, Topsoe aims to help customers progress toward their decarbonization targets while supporting emission-reduction efforts not only in China but also across Europe, reinforcing the global nature of the energy transition.

From the project owner’s perspective, Aijun Li, Chairman of Tangshan Jinlihai, highlighted the broader strategic implications. He stated that the jointly developed SAF project represents a key milestone in the company’s expansion into high-end green energy solutions and its pursuit of “new quality productivity.” Leveraging the geographic and industrial strengths of the Caofeidian Petrochemical Industry Base, the project will integrate waste oil resources with Topsoe’s globally leading technology to establish a high-quality SAF production facility. Beyond extending Jinlihai’s green industrial chain, the project also aligns with China’s “dual carbon” goals—carbon peaking and carbon neutrality—and supports the low-carbon transformation of the aviation sector.

The agreement comes at a time when global demand for sustainable aviation fuel is rising rapidly. The International Air Transport Association forecasts that SAF production will more than double in 2025 compared with 2024, reaching approximately 2.1 million tons, or 2.7 billion liters. Despite this growth, SAF would still account for only about 0.7% of total global jet fuel consumption. Looking further ahead, the International Energy Agency, in its Net Zero Scenario, estimates that more than 10% of aviation fuel demand must be met by SAF by 2030 to keep the industry on track for net-zero emissions by 2050.

The project will be located in Tangshan, Hebei province, within the Caofeidian Petrochemical Industry Base. With a planned investment of around USD 210 million, construction is expected to begin in the second half of 2026, while commercial operations are targeted for the second half of 2028.

This latest agreement further strengthens Topsoe’s expanding footprint in China’s SAF market and represents its sixth SAF-related contract in the country.

The report, released on the sidelines of the ASEAN 2050 Sustainable Aviation Fuel Outlook summit in Hanoi on Jan. 23, projected that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations' internal demand for SAF will rise sharply, exceeding 700,000 b/d by 2050.

Meanwhile, the region's production potential from agricultural and forestry waste remains significantly greater, according to the report.

Potential supply is expected to rise to 8.5 million b/d by 2050 from 7.5 million b/d in 2030, with Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines identified as having the greatest potential surpluses after meeting domestic mandates, the report said.

High-income hubs, including Japan, Singapore and South Korea, are projected to be the primary ""off-takers,"" with an import demand of about 607,000 b/d by mid-century, the report added.

Bridging the 'green premium'

Despite abundant feedstock, a significant economic challenge is the ""levelized cost"" of production, the report said. The hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids pathway remains the only commercially deployable technology, yet its production costs are nearly double those of conventional petroleum-derived jet fuel.

Alternative pathways such as alcohol-to-jet and gasification/Fischer-Tropsch currently cost four to six times as much as fossil fuels, according to the report.

One potential cost-saver identified is the integration of SAF production into existing petroleum refineries. Retrofitting facilities to handle bio-alcohol intermediates could reduce unit capital expenditures by 20% and lower overall levelized costs by 10%, the report added.

Call for 'ASEAN SAF Alliance'

To capitalize on this comparative advantage, regional leaders in Hanoi called for the establishment of the ASEAN SAF Alliance to harmonize certification and trading frameworks.

""ASEAN regional SAF supply potential significantly outpaces projected demand, highlighting Southeast Asia's comparative advantage as a potential future SAF hub,"" the report said.

The report added that the region's primary feedstocks -- rice straw, cassava and forestry residues -- offer a low-carbon intensity path that avoids the land-use controversies currently affecting western biofuel markets.

The report also called for specific trade lanes between selected feedstock supply countries, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, and import countries like Singapore.

Such developments could promote the establishment of green trade lanes or corridors in Southeast Asia, aligning with the International Maritime Organization's greenhouse gas emission goals and existing sustainable shipping initiatives, the report said.

The report added that this could also serve as a progressive scale-up initiative, establishing regional supply chain hubs within Southeast Asia involving countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, as well as countries such as Japan, the Philippines and South Korea.

Strategic outlook

For global markets, the Hanoi findings signal a pivot toward the ""waste-residue"" complex. As Europe phases out soy-based feedstocks by 2030, Southeast Asia's 8.5 million b/d SAF potential represents the most significant new supply frontier for an aviation industry under intense pressure to reach net zero, according to the report.

""Taking advantage of economies of scale and technology development can drive cost reduction through efficiency gains,"" the report said, urging immediate investment in ""green trade lanes"" between Southeast Asian producers and regional aviation hubs.

Pitkin, Mesa, Delta and Eagle counties have been looking into the viability of creating sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, since 2024.

Michael Port manages Pitkin County’s climate initiatives and oversaw the feasibility project.

""We did not find a business case today for building a SAF plant, given current technology,” Port told the Board of County Commissioners on Tuesday. “But it is still a young — relatively young — market, and things might change over the coming years.”

SAF can be made from a variety of materials, including trees, plant seeds and algae. It’s blended with traditional jet fuel, improving air quality and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. There are currently only a handful of SAF plants in the U.S.

The study examined three potential sources for the fuel: forestry residue (like dead trees), oilseed crops, and solid waste from landfills.

Each of those options presented challenges that the counties deemed insurmountable for the time being.

The region probably has enough forestry residue, for example, but moving those dead trees to a single location would be too costly.

“We have a lot of material, but it's spread out over a large distance, so that poses a challenge,” Port said. “The types of technologies that are currently available require large feedstock volumes to be profitable.”

Airlines wouldn’t buy the SAF if it weren’t cost-competitive, Port said.

Commissioner Greg Poschman noted that the technology is water-intensive, which might make it a bad fit for the region.

The report provides a regional supply chain assessment for 2030, 2040, and 2050, examining potential SAF demand and supply scenarios across Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam, as well as import markets including Japan, Singapore, and the Republic of Korea (ROK).

The report was developed by GHD through financial support provided by Global Affairs Canada from the Canadian Trade and Investment Facility for Development (CTIF) implemented by Cowater International (Cowater) in association with the Institute of Public Administrators of Canada (IPAC) and Global Affairs Canada, with Boeing as the knowledge partner, and supporting the ASEAN Secretariat.

SAF is a renewable or waste-derived aviation fuel that meets sustainability criteria, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and is compatible with existing aircraft and infrastructure, as a “drop-in” fuel. ASEAN’s key SAF feedstocks include used cooking oil, rice waste, cassava waste, and forestry residues.

According to the SAF 2050 Outlook report, all the ASEAN countries examined could potentially have sufficient capacity to position themselves as net SAF exporters. Viet Nam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand have the most abundant feedstock to support SAF production, while Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, may have the most cost-efficient distribution for markets in Japan, Singapore and ROK.

In addition to exporting SAF, ASEAN is predicted to become a significant market for SAF in its own right. The report projects that SAF demand in ASEAN will grow sharply from 15,000 barrels per day in 2030, to over 700,000 barrels per day by 2050. The largest SAF demands are expected to come from Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, as well as other Asian economies such as Japan and ROK.

The report also examined different ways of producing SAF. Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) is the most prevalent technology for producing SAF today, costing about twice as much as jet fuel, with the largest cost contributor being feedstock. Alternative Gasification/Fisher-Tropsch (Gasification + FT), and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) and Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) pathways could be 4-7 times more expensive, but this gap is expected to reduce as technologies mature and scale up.

Deputy Secretary-General for the ASEAN Economic Community, Satvinder Singh, said, “The ASEAN SAF 2050 Outlook confirms our region’s strong comparative advantage on the supply side, particularly in the availability of sustainable bio-feedstocks. At the same time, rising regional and global demand for sustainable aviation fuel presents a clear market opportunity for ASEAN.”

To fully capitalise on both demand and supply dynamics, ASEAN Member States should work together to scale up production capacity, deploy cost-effective technologies, and establish robust regional trade and market frameworks. By efficiently matching our abundant agricultural resources with growing SAF demand, ASEAN can position itself not only as a self-sufficient and competitive sustainable aviation hub, but also as a reliable energy supplier supporting the decarbonisation of the broader Asia-Pacific aviation and energy markets.”

Sharmine Tan, Boeing’s regional sustainability lead for Southeast Asia said, “Southeast Asia’s commercial aviation industry is growing rapidly to serve the region’s expanding economies and meet demand from passengers and for air cargo. In addition to adding more fuel-efficient airplanes to the fleet, increasing Southeast Asia’s supply of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) will further enable responsible growth. The ASEAN 2050 SAF Outlook shows the region’s strong potential to increase SAF production with the right policies, partnerships and investments.”

Sachin Narang, GHD’s Executive Advisor – Energy and Infrastructure, said, “We are at an exciting juncture with respect to SAF because ASEAN has an abundance of agricultural and forestry waste that could serve as low-cost feedstock, narrowing the premium between HEFA-derived SAF and jet fuel. At the same time, policy intervention, overall targeted interventions, scaling, and innovation can narrow the cost gap for alternative SAF pathways over the medium to long term.”

The ASEAN SAF 2050 Outlook report follows the joint Canadian-ASEAN techno-economic assessment on converting agricultural waste into SAF released in April 2025.

Key findings of the joint Canadian-ASEAN research project extension

ASEAN’s Comparative Advantage: ASEAN regional SAF supply potential significantly outpaces projected demand, highlighting Southeast Asia’s comparative advantage as a potential future SAF hub.

Rapidly growing demand in Southeast Asia: Based on potential uptake of SAF blend rates, the forecast SAF demand in ASEAN was projected to grow sharply from 15,000 bpd in 2030, to over 700,000 bpd by 2050. Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand were expected to be the largest demand centers in the ASEAN region.

Significant SAF supply potential: The potential SAF supply from agricultural and sustainable forestry biomass is projected to rise from approximately 7.5 million bpd in 2030 to reaching as much as 8.5 million bpd in 2050. All ASEAN countries examined could potentially have sufficient capacity to position themselves as net SAF exporters. Viet Nam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand have the most abundant feedstock to support SAF production. Southeast Asia’s key SAF feedstocks include used cooking oil, rice waste, cassava waste, and forestry residues.

Export and regional trade opportunities: By 2040, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam could become net exporters, while Japan, Singapore and South Korea are anticipated as strong SAF importers in region. Additionally, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, may have the most cost-efficient distribution, when considering key potential SAF importers noted above.

Financial Assessment: Boeing led the research approval of the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway in 2011, today it is the most prevalent technology adopted for SAF production. Through the technology pathway financial assessment conducted, HEFA was found to have a levelised cost of about double that of crude oil-derived jet fuel, while Gasification/Fisher-Tropsch (Gasification + FT), Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ), and Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) pathways ranged from four (4) to seven (7) times higher. This gap is expected to reduce as technologies mature and scale up.

The French city of Nice has been well aware of the impact of luxury travel on its infrastructure. The city's mayor has previously worked to ban cruise ships from docking there.

Besides being a tacky display of wealth, luxury travel produces an outsized share of pollution. Per passenger emissions from private jets are far higher than commercial airlines. For example, one study suggested that Jeff Bezos' two private jets crank out more pollution in a year than the average Amazon worker could in 207 years.

Worse still, private jet travel is on the rise. Between 2019 and 2023, private jet pollution went up 50%. A big part of this increase are empty legs, where private jets fly without passengers on board.

Private jet pollution has immediate effects on local air quality, but the issue is even bigger than that. Atmospheric pollution traps heat, exacerbates destructive weather patterns, and passes the costs of natural disasters to society at large. This has led to crises in home insurance and agriculture.

The use of sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to reduce pollution from air travel, but there are much lower-impact options available, like rail. Taking the train when possible is not only better for the environment, it can be a very comfortable ride, too.

Reddit commenters were less than pleased to see so many private jets parked in the south of France.

DAVOS Switzerland: Sabah is positioning itself as a regional hub for sustainable energy and downstream processing as global investor Petra Seaga evaluates a potential investment of about USD300 million (RM1.4 billion) in the state’s biomass and renewable energy sector.

Chairman of Invest Sabah Berhad, Datuk Roger Chin, said the proposed investment reflects growing international confidence in Sabah’s long-term economic direction, particularly in sustainable energy and the bioeconomy.

Speaking on behalf of the Sabah Chief Minister at the World Economic Forum 2026 in Davos, Chin said Petra Seaga has expressed interest in establishing a presence in Sabah and is studying the feasibility of developing an integrated biorefinery complex.

He stressed, however, that the State Government views such expressions of interest as a vote of confidence rather than a guaranteed outcome, noting that all projects must meet commercial, regulatory and sustainability requirements.

According to Chin, the project under consideration goes beyond a conventional energy facility. It would potentially involve the conversion of agricultural and forestry biomass, including palm oil residues, into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), biofuels, biochemicals, bioplastics and renewable power, based on circular economy principles to minimise waste and maximise efficiency.

“Sabah is particularly well positioned for this type of development,” he said, citing the state’s large volumes of underutilised biomass generated annually from palm oil, timber and agricultural activities.

Chin said the initiative aligns with Sabah’s broader strategy to move away from a purely resource-based economy towards downstream processing, advanced manufacturing and technology-driven industries, with sustainable energy as a key pillar of this transition.

He added that the State Government is strengthening core infrastructure, including water security, energy reliability, transport, logistics and industrial-ready land, while aligning policies to be more predictable and investor-friendly. Sabah, he said, is especially receptive to ESG-compliant investments and blue economy initiatives.

Sustainable aviation fuel has emerged as a strategic priority for the region amid rising air travel demand and increasing pressure on airlines to decarbonise.

Chin said Sabah aims to help address the regional supply gap, with a longer-term ambition to serve wider East Asian markets.

Beyond individual projects, Chin said Sabah is focused on building a sustainable industrial ecosystem that could attract technology providers, research partners and downstream users, creating skilled employment and long-term capacity for the state.

He also welcomed the decision by the Southeast Asia Sustainable Aviation Fuel Council to establish its headquarters in Kota Kinabalu, describing it as a significant step in positioning Sabah as a regional platform for policy dialogue and industry coordination.

Chin said Invest Sabah Berhad will continue to facilitate discussions with credible investors, ensuring transparency, regulatory compliance and alignment with the state’s environmental, social and economic priorities.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d65831_a43a02bc0a8145ad9a4ab47fbc692419~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1080,h_810,al_c/d65831_a43a02bc0a8145ad9a4ab47fbc692419~mv2.jpg",N,,2026-01-23 05:38:06.945030

The state’s Environmental Department in late 2024 released a discussion draft of a rule to implement the program.
Clean Fuel Alliance America is applauding the New Mexico Environmental Approval board for approving the CTFP rules.
“From a market perspective, New Mexico represents an almost 800-million-gallon opportunity for the biomass-based diesel industry,” said Cory-Ann Wind, director of state regulatory affairs for Clean Fuels.
“As the first non–West Coast state to implement a clean fuel standard, New Mexico proves that states with strong energy economies can also lead on clean fuel deployment and market certainty,” said Jeff Earl, director of state governmental affairs for Clean Fuels.","The New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board on Jan. 22 unanimously adopted regulations adopting a Clean Transportation Fuel Program, making New Mexico the fourth U.S. state to adopt a clean fuel standard. Similar programs are already in place in California, Oregon and Washington.

New Mexico’s CTFP was established by legislation signed by New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in March 2024. The state’s Environmental Department in late 2024 released a discussion draft of a rule to implement the program. A proposed rule was released in May 2025 and a public hearing process launched later that year. Rules implementing the CTFP are now final, with the program scheduled to enter into force on April 1, 2026.

The CTFP is a market-based initiative designed to incentivize and expand access to lower-carbon transportation fuels, including ethanol, biodiesel, renewable diesel, renewable natural gas (RNG), electricity and supporting infrastructure. The program aims to reduce the carbon intensity (CI) of transportation fuel by at least 20% by 2030 and at least 30% below a 2018 baseline by 2040.

The New Mexico Environment Department expects the CTFP to boost economic development across the state, create more than 800 jobs, and reduce health care costs by improving air quality. Overall, the program is expected to deliver $1.65 billion in net benefits to New Mexicans through avoided air quality health impacts and climate change infrastructure damages. Cumulatively through 2040, the program will prevent 337 asthma cases, 60 work-loss days, 59 school-loss days, and 353 restricted activity days for children.

By 2030, the agency expects the program to reduce PM2.5 by 144 tons, VOCs by 200 tons, and NOx emissions by 169 tons. The program will also move New Mexico closer to meeting the state’s goal of cutting climate pollution 45% by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

Clean Fuel Alliance America is applauding the New Mexico Environmental Approval board for approving the CTFP rules. “From a market perspective, New Mexico represents an almost 800-million-gallon opportunity for the biomass-based diesel industry,” said Cory-Ann Wind, director of state regulatory affairs for Clean Fuels. “Since it sits along a key corridor for both feedstocks and finished fuels produced in the Gulf Coast and Midwest, New Mexico’s entry into the market not only expands the demand for clean fuels but further strengthens the supply chain”.

“As the first non–West Coast state to implement a clean fuel standard, New Mexico proves that states with strong energy economies can also lead on clean fuel deployment and market certainty,” said Jeff Earl, director of state governmental affairs for Clean Fuels. “This program adds real momentum to clean fuel standard adoption nationwide.”

Reported earnings per share of $0.18, with adjusted earnings per share of $0.43, ahead of expectations and previous guidance range

Generated $1.2 billion in operating cash flow for the full year

SEATTLE, Jan. 22, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Alaska Air Group Inc. (NYSE: ALK) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2025.

""We feel momentum accelerating in 2026 as the Alaska-Hawaiian Airlines combination gains full strength,"" said CEO Ben Minicucci. ""The people across our airlines delivered through a transformational year that set us up to win: an expanding global network, premium travel experiences delivered with care, and Atmos Rewards elevating our 11-year streak as the No. 1 airline loyalty program. Our model is positioned for where travelers are headed, and we're ready to compete as one of four global U.S. airlines.""

Quarter in Review

Alaska Air Group's (Air Group) Consolidated Statements of Operations, Consolidated Balance Sheets, and Summary Cash Flow Statement include Hawaiian Airlines from September 18, 2024 onward. For comparability of financial and operational results, historical information has also been provided on a pro forma basis for the full year 2024 within the Supplementary Pro Forma Comparative Financial and Operating Information in this filing and in prior 8-K filings. The results presented for the fourth quarter of 2024 in the supplementary section are as reported given the inclusion of Hawaiian Airlines in Air Group for the full quarter.

Air Group reported fourth quarter GAAP pretax margin of 0.8% and net income per share of $0.18. Our fourth quarter adjusted pretax margin was 1.8% and our adjusted earnings per share was $0.43.

We continued to build on key milestones for our Alaska Accelerate strategy during the quarter, including achieving a single operating certificate for Alaska and Hawaiian Airlines. We achieved record credit card acquisitions, with nearly one fourth of all signups being for the new premium credit card that we introduced late in the third quarter. We began selling our new international routes from Seattle to London and Rome during the quarter, with the first flights scheduled to operate in spring 2026. We are also now selling in six foreign currencies and recently unveiled our Japanese, Korean, and Italian-language based websites, helping drive point of sale outside of the United States to support our expanding international service. These achievements represent continued progress in building the infrastructure to support Air Group's future growth and profitability, and deliver on our Alaska Accelerate goal of $10 earnings per share in 2027 enabled by $1 billion in incremental profit.

Fourth quarter revenue was $3.6 billion, resulting in a 0.6% year-over-year RASM increase despite contending with temporary demand pullback from the government shutdown in November. We believe our fourth quarter unit revenue result will be among the highest in the industry. Corporate travel grew 9% year-over-year, while close-in demand remained strong throughout the fourth quarter as bookings and yields continue to rebound from the challenging environment earlier in the year. Our diverse revenue streams continued to deliver with premium revenue increasing 7% year-over-year, cargo revenue increasing 22% year-over-year, and loyalty revenue increasing 12% year-over-year. Commercial initiatives and synergy capture remained on track for the fourth consecutive quarter.

Unit costs, excluding fuel, freighter costs, and special items increased 1.3% year-over-year. This result is better than prior guidance and signals our teams' renewed focus on cost control. Economic fuel price per gallon was $2.57 per gallon in the fourth quarter, reflecting elevated West Coast refining prices during the quarter.

First Quarter & Full Year 2026 Guidance

In the first three weeks of January, bookings have inflected positive relative to last year. We have seen several of the highest booking days in our history since January 1st with managed corporate revenues up 20% year-over-year for the first quarter. We expect first quarter unit revenues to be solidly positive and earnings per share to be approximately flat year-over-year which would mark another sequential improvement towards earnings expansion.

Given the macroeconomic headwinds the industry experienced in 2025 and the positive emergent demand trends, our guidance for 2026 reflects a wide range of potential macroeconomic outcomes. We expect to continue to realize value from Alaska Accelerate initiatives and synergies from the Hawaiian integration, which remain on track or ahead of plan relative to our initial expectations. To hit the higher end of our guidance range we would require sustained macroeconomic recovery in 2026, at or improving on trends seen in the first three weeks of the year, and for fuel prices to stabilize. Given the inherent uncertainty of the macroeconomic environment, we remain as focused as ever on controlling what is within our control, including disciplined cost management, driving strong productivity and delivering on our initiatives.

SPECIAL ITEMS (unaudited)

Air Group has classified certain operating and non-operating activity as special items due to their unusual or infrequently occurring nature. We believe disclosing information about these items separately improves comparable year-over-year analysis and allows stakeholders to better understand our results of operations. A description of the special items is provided below.

Integration costs: Integration costs were associated with the acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines and consist of employee-related, legal and professional fees, technology, and other merger costs.

Labor and other: Labor and other costs in 2025 were primarily for changes to Alaska flight attendants' sick leave benefits pursuant to a new collective bargaining agreement. Costs in 2024 were primarily for retroactive pay for Alaska flight attendants pursuant to a tentative agreement and litigation costs related to the Virgin trademark license agreement.

Net non-operating: The income in 2024 is primarily for gains on Hawaiian debt extinguishment in the fourth quarter.

GAAP TO NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS (unaudited)

Alaska Air Group, Inc.

We are providing reconciliations of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. Amounts in the tables below are rounded to the nearest million. As a result, a manual recalculation of certain figures using these rounded amounts may not agree directly to the actual figures presented in the tables below.

Note A: Pursuant to Regulation G, we are providing reconciliations of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. We believe that consideration of these non-GAAP financial measures may be important to investors for the following reasons:

By excluding certain costs from our unit metrics, we believe that we have better visibility into the results of operations. Our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs, so even a small reduction in non-fuel operating costs can result in a significant improvement in operating results. We believe that all U.S. carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run, so it is important for management and investors to understand the impact of company-specific cost drivers which are more controllable by management. We adjust for expenses related directly to our freighter aircraft operations, including those costs incurred under the ATSA with Amazon, to allow for better comparability to other carriers that do not operate freighter aircraft. We also exclude certain special charges as they are unusual or nonrecurring in nature and adjusting for these expenses allows management and investors to better understand our cost performance.

CASMex is one of the most important measures used by management and by the Air Group Board of Directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance. CASMex is also a measure commonly used by industry analysts, and we believe it is the basis by which they have historically compared our airline to others in the industry. The measure is also the subject of frequent questions from investors.

Adjusted pretax income is an important metric for the employee incentive plan, which covers the majority of Air Group employees.

Disclosure of the individual impact of certain noted items provides investors the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without these special items. We believe that disclosing the impact of these items as noted above is important because it provides information on significant items that are not necessarily indicative of future performance. Industry analysts and investors consistently measure our performance without these items for better comparability between periods and among other airlines.

Although we disclose our unit revenue, we do not, nor are we able to, evaluate unit revenue excluding the impact that changes in fuel costs have had on ticket prices. Fuel expense represents a large percentage of our total operating expenses. Fluctuations in fuel prices often drive changes in unit revenue in the mid-to-long term. Although we believe it is useful to evaluate non-fuel unit costs for the reasons noted above, we would caution readers of these financial statements not to place undue reliance on unit costs excluding fuel as a measure or predictor of future profitability because of the significant impact of fuel costs on our business.

For comparability of financial and operational results, historical information has also been provided on a pro forma basis for the full year 2024 within the Supplementary Pro Forma Comparative Financial and Operating Information in this filing and in prior 8-K filings. The results presented for the fourth quarter of 2024 in the supplementary section are as reported given the inclusion of Hawaiian Airlines in Air Group for the full quarter.

Air Group reported fourth quarter GAAP pretax margin of 0.8% and net income per share of $0.18. Our fourth quarter adjusted pretax margin was 1.8% and our adjusted earnings per share was $0.43.

We continued to build on key milestones for our Alaska Accelerate strategy during the quarter, including achieving a single operating certificate for Alaska and Hawaiian Airlines. We achieved record credit card acquisitions, with nearly one fourth of all signups being for the new premium credit card that we introduced late in the third quarter. We began selling our new international routes from Seattle to London and Rome during the quarter, with the first flights scheduled to operate in spring 2026. We are also now selling in six foreign currencies and recently unveiled our Japanese, Korean, and Italian-language based websites, helping drive point of sale outside of the United States to support our expanding international service. These achievements represent continued progress in building the infrastructure to support Air Group’s future growth and profitability, and deliver on our Alaska Accelerate goal of $10 earnings per share in 2027 enabled by $1 billion in incremental profit.

Fourth quarter revenue was $3.6 billion, resulting in a 0.6% year-over-year RASM increase despite contending with temporary demand pullback from the government shutdown in November. We believe our fourth quarter unit revenue result will be among the highest in the industry. Corporate travel grew 9% year-over-year, while close-in demand remained strong throughout the fourth quarter as bookings and yields continue to rebound from the challenging environment earlier in the year. Our diverse revenue streams continued to deliver with premium revenue increasing 7% year-over-year, cargo revenue increasing 22% year-over-year, and loyalty revenue increasing 12% year-over-year. Commercial initiatives and synergy capture remained on track for the fourth consecutive quarter.

Unit costs, excluding fuel, freighter costs, and special items increased 1.3% year-over-year. This result is better than prior guidance and signals our teams’ renewed focus on cost control. Economic fuel price per gallon was $2.57 per gallon in the fourth quarter, reflecting elevated West Coast refining prices during the quarter.

In the first three weeks of January, bookings have inflected positive relative to last year. We have seen several of the highest booking days in our history since January 1st with managed corporate revenues up 20% year-over-year for the first quarter. We expect first quarter unit revenues to be solidly positive and earnings per share to be approximately flat year-over-year which would mark another sequential improvement towards earnings expansion.

Given the macroeconomic headwinds the industry experienced in 2025 and the positive emergent demand trends, our guidance for 2026 reflects a wide range of potential macroeconomic outcomes. We expect to continue to realize value from Alaska Accelerate initiatives and synergies from the Hawaiian integration, which remain on track or ahead of plan relative to our initial expectations. To hit the higher end of our guidance range we would require sustained macroeconomic recovery in 2026, at or improving on trends seen in the first three weeks of the year, and for fuel prices to stabilize. Given the inherent uncertainty of the macroeconomic environment, we remain as focused as ever on controlling what is within our control, including disciplined cost management, driving strong productivity and delivering on our initiatives.

Mugnaini says Wisconsin’s legislation would be a production credit, where some other states have a use credit, and making SAF in Wisconsin and selling it to facilities in other states could double the benefits. “On the ethanol side, we’re probably never going to compete with Iowa and Nebraska, but on sustainable aviation fuel, we can be a national leader on that and this bill, getting it over the hump and passed and signed into law would be the first step in making sure that companies who are looking to build these types of facilities are looking at Wisconsin first.”

The bill would also encourage SAF production with other feedstocks including dairy and forestry byproducts.

MI worked with a group of experts across the industry to provide the first of its kind comprehensive overview of MtJ, its potential, needed policy incentives and assessment of opportunities and challenges ahead.

As global jet fuel demand is expected to rise by 50% by 2050, aviation faces a widening gap between climate targets and the availability of affordable low-carbon fuels. SAF is essential to closing that gap and existing pathways alone cannot deliver the volumes required. MI’s new report indicates MtJ will help bridge this gap by combining strong emissions performance with scale and cost advantages. MtJ builds on a global methanol value chain producing more than 100 million tonnes per year, with renewable and low-carbon capacity expanding rapidly.

“The challenge for aviation is no longer proving that SAF works. It’s producing enough of it, fast enough,” said Alexander Döll, Chief Executive Officer of Methanol Institute. “Methanol-to-Jet offers a realistic pathway to scale because it connects aviation to an existing industrial system that is already global, flexible, and growing. Policy decisions taken in the next few years will determine which SAF pathways reach scale,” Döll added. “Methanol-to-Jet can move forward now, provided that market signals are clear.”

Key findings

• Deep emissions cuts at scale: MtJ produced from renewable methanol can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by 70–90% compared to conventional jet fuel, making it a strong candidate for meeting long-term climate targets.

• Cost advantage over other emerging SAF options: MtJ from renewable sources is among the most cost competitive SAF pathway outperforming Fischer–Tropsch and advanced alcohol-based routes. With supportive policies, integrated MtJ plants could approach cost parity with fossil jet fuel by 2040.

• Commercial use within reach: as early as 2026, MtJ could be used in commercial aircrafts and access policy incentives in major markets. The pathway is advancing through the international standard approval process (ASTM International) required before new fuels can be used in commercial aircraft.

• Projects moving toward investment decisions: As of August 2025, MtJ projects under development represent around 1.8 million tonnes per year of future SAF capacity with over 60 Mt of announced capacity across e-methanol, biomethanol, and low-carbon methanol by 2030. China leads with about half of global projects, followed by Europe and North America.

• Reduced exposure to feedstock constraints: as one of the largest commodities in the world, methanol can be produced through multiple pathways including fossil and renewable resources, with options such as carbon capture and the use of low-carbon or renewable electricity. This make MtJ less vulnerable to the feedstock constraints already affecting some SAF pathways.

• Supportive policy is critical: the report identifies that tax credits, SAF blending mandates and global programs such as CORSIA are essential to give the necessary signals for investor confidence.

• MtJ is complimentary to other SAF with demand for jet fuel projected to rise from ~350 Mt in 2024 to ~500 Mt by 2040–2045.

Clean fuel producers persevered through a year that saw slower production amidst unsettled regulation, including questions about 45Z tax credits and the possibility of Renewable Fuel Standard exemptions for small refineries.

But there were also key wins, and the industry can get back on track as positive policy is finalized and put into action this year.

EPA’s proposed increase in biomass-based diesel (BBD) Renewable Volume Obligations (RVO) of nearly 2 billion gallons for 2026.

Exclusion of speculative indirect land-use change scores from 45Z tax credits.

Numerous new opportunities in state-level clean fuel standards.

“We will lean into this moment,” Rehagen said. “The strong RVO proposal, the [indirect land-use change] exclusion, the 45Z tax credit—these aren’t abstractions. They’re our runway. We’ll turn those billions of gallons on paper into actual production, actual jobs, actual impact.”

To achieve this, all producers and stakeholders along the value chain must remain aligned, he said.

“Last year showed us what happens when we set aside some differences and work together. When biodiesel and renewable diesel producers joined forces with oil and gas refiners who’ve invested in our space—and farmers – when we aligned on RVO goals, we saw something powerful emerge. That unity between ag and energy gave us leverage we’ve never had before.”

The conference, held Jan. 19-22, featured sessions covering topics from exports to regulation and feedstocks, to new markets and more.

In addition, several major Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and fleets previewed the latest diesel technology and clean fuels innovations in a vehicle showcase on site.

John Deere, with its Gator XUV and John Deere 6 Series Tractor.

Caterpillar, with its Cat® 903 Compact Wheel Loader featuring the new Cat C1.7 Tier 4 Final engine.

Estes Express Lines with an International LT625 truck from its fleet, equipped with a Cummins X15 diesel engine and the Immixt Renewable Fuel System to operate on biodiesel blends up to B100.

The sessions and vehicles on display showed how progress within the industry and along the transportation network has created momentum for growth.

Vince, who runs green energy firm Ecotricity, had bankrolled the business since its inception but says he has paused his investment into Ecojet.
Alongside Vince, Ecojet was run by chief executive Brent Smith, a former airline pilot, with ex-Air Malta chief Peter Davies its third director.
Davies is also a founder of consultancy Airline Management Group whose subsidiary AMG Ventures initially held a small stake in Ecojet.
Ecojet was set up by Smith in 2021 as Fresh Airlines, before changing its name in 2023.","A bid by green entrepreneur Dale Vince to create a zero-emission regional carrier has ended without the would-be operator ever getting off the ground, following the appointment of provisional liquidators to Ecojet Airlines.

Unveiled in 2023 with the strapline “the airline for a Green Britain”, Ecojet struggled from the outset, repeatedly pushing back deadlines for launch.

Despite an extensive recruitment drive in anticipation of the commencement of operations in early 2024 – a date later pushed back by at least one year – most staff were laid off in January 2025 as the start-up struggled to attract external funding.

And although it limped on this year, the company’s directors have now opted to pull the plug.

Provisional liquidators Paul Dounis and Mark Harper from insolvency firm Opus appointed to the firm on 14 January “following a voluntary liquidation initiated by the company’s board”, Opus says.

“Ecojet was a start-up business and has no material assets. The members have elected to fund the liquidation process to ensure that the company’s employees receive their full statutory entitlements,” it adds.

Vince, who runs green energy firm Ecotricity, had bankrolled the business since its inception but says he has paused his investment into Ecojet.

“We remain committed to electrifying all forms of transport – aviation is the last frontier and the hardest. It’s taking longer than we hoped to get the technology and regulatory pieces of the puzzle in alignment, and so we’re pausing work at this time,” he says.

“This is a vital frontier in the move to net zero, green living, whatever you choose to call it - and it’s absolutely doable. It’s a matter of when not if.”

But the liquidation comes sooner than anticipated. Ecojet’s accounts for the 12 months to 31 August 2024 – approved by the board on 14 August last year – stated that “operational funding support” from its shareholders “is expected to continue for a period of at least one year after the date of signing the financial statements”.

Vince’s Ecotricity Group received 17,000 shares in Ecojet in October 2024 in return for an investment of a little over £1 million, the accounts disclose.

At its unveiling, Ecojet pledged to begin operating domestic routes from Edinburgh in early 2024 using a fleet of small turboprops, likely De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters. As the business expanded it planned to switch to larger 70-seat turboprops for longer routes.

However, it subsequently changed its strategy, opting to launch with a small fleet of ATR 72-600s.

In both cases, it intended to operate the aircraft on sustainable aviation fuel before converting them to run on zero-emission hydrogen fuel cell powertrains.

As part of that process, in November 2023 Ecojet signed an agreement with advanced propulsion developer ZeroAvia for up to 70 units of its hydrogen-electric engines, a mixture of 600kW ZA600 and 2MW ZA2000 systems, the latter suitable for the conversion of large turboprops.

A separate deal was also struck with ARC Aerosystems for up to 50 examples of its Linx P9 gyroplane.

Alongside Vince, Ecojet was run by chief executive Brent Smith, a former airline pilot, with ex-Air Malta chief Peter Davies its third director.

Davies is also a founder of consultancy Airline Management Group whose subsidiary AMG Ventures initially held a small stake in Ecojet.

Corn prices and input costs rose in 2020 and 2021, but inputs remained high while corn prices fell, he said.
Hundreds of thousands of Iowa farmers defaulted on their loans, significantly impacting farm families, rural communities and the state’s economy.
“I have taken some calls from farmers,” said Kevin Studer, Iowa Corn Growers Association’s vice president of government relations.
Without new or expanded markets, Miller said the gap between supply and demand will continue to grow, leading to lower corn prices and a greater reliance on federal subsidies.","Corn production in Iowa and the U.S. has been on an upward trajectory for decades and hit a record high in 2025.

But a new study prepared for the Iowa Corn Growers Association and Iowa Renewable Fuels Association predicts a growing gap between supply and demand over the next decade, which could continue to drag down corn prices.

Farmers need new and expanded markets for corn and ethanol to stay profitable, according to the study and industry leaders who spoke on a press call Wednesday.

“The bottom line is: We have high input prices, we have low commodity prices and we’re producing more corn all the time. We need more places to move our corn,” said Mark Mueller, president of Iowa Corn Growers Association.

Mueller, a fourth-generation farmer who grows corn, soybeans and alfalfa in northeast Iowa, said he’s worried low profitability will hinder the fifth generation from farming on his family’s land. Corn prices and input costs rose in 2020 and 2021, but inputs remained high while corn prices fell, he said.

Mueller said his farm’s operating loan has been renewed for another year, but that’s not the case for other farmers in the region.

Several speakers on the call warned of a farm crisis similar to what happened in the 1980s. Hundreds of thousands of Iowa farmers defaulted on their loans, significantly impacting farm families, rural communities and the state’s economy.

“I have taken some calls from farmers,” said Kevin Studer, Iowa Corn Growers Association’s vice president of government relations. “And it reminded me as a kid, being in the '80s, of neighbors stopping in to my dad and just saying, ‘Hey, I’m not in a good spot.’”

Studer said farmers are in urgent need of market solutions.

Three pathways forward for corn farmers

The study pulls in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Long-Term Outlook, which estimates acres planted with corn will decline over the next decade from its recent high in 2025, while corn yields will increase roughly 2 bushels per acre.

“You end up with about 180 million more bushels every year just from production,” said Dave Miller, chief economist at Decision Innovation Solutions, the company that prepared the study.

Miller laid out three pathways if farmers across the U.S. maintain the number of corn acres planted in 2025.

Without new or expanded markets, Miller said the gap between supply and demand will continue to grow, leading to lower corn prices and a greater reliance on federal subsidies.

A second pathway includes the year-round sale of E15, a gasoline blended with 10.5% to 15% ethanol.

Most states cannot sell E15 from June to September without temporary emergency waivers due to air pollution regulations. Some research indicates the risks are the same as E10, which can be sold year-round.

Replacing E10 with E15 across the U.S. could close the demand gap for corn by 2031, Miller said. But it's predicted to grow again starting in 2033, in part due to projected growth in electric vehicles and hybrids.

The third pathway includes year-round E15, plus the use of corn for low-carbon marine fuels and sustainable aviation fuel. Miller said this scenario could help corn stay profitable through 2040.

“E15 is not an efficient long-term solution,” Miller said. “It is a near-term solution that is very powerful, but at the long run, we need to be able to take and access two great big markets that exist.”

The marine fuel market is transitioning to low carbon fuel options and uses 70 to 80 billion gallons per year, according to the study. Sustainable aviation fuel represents a 35 billion gallon per year market.

When asked about the possibility of farmers shifting to other crops instead of growing more corn, Miller said it would swamp those other markets and pull down prices.

Mueller, with the Iowa Corn Growers Association, brought up the lack of infrastructure, explaining farmers grew sugar beets in northeast Iowa 100 years ago.

“My grandfather loaded up a horse drawn wagon and took those sugar beets to the Waverly sugar factory located just a few miles down the road,” Mueller said. “I could still grow sugar beets, but the nearest plant now is in north central Minnesota.”

Along with higher transportation costs, Mueller said he’d be competing against sugar beet farmers in Minnesota and North and South Dakota who pay less rent for their land. Mueller said his family also stopped growing sweet corn when the canning factory in Waverly closed in 2004.

“Believe me, I'd like to raise other crops. I do raise a little bit of alfalfa, but there's not a big market for that,” Mueller said. “We need corn because, once again, it's the thing that makes us the most money in our system, of our capitalist system.”

'Two battles' at the state and federal level

Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said the easiest and most cost-effective way for Iowa to compete in ultra-low carbon markets is through carbon capture use and sequestration.

Summit Carbon Solutions, a company based in Ames, is trying to build a multi-state pipeline to transport carbon dioxide captured from ethanol plants to either permanently store underground or use for “industrial purposes,” according to its website.

Several environmental groups, including the Iowa Chapter of the Sierra Club, and a group of landowners have pushed back on the project, largely over safety concerns and property rights.

The Iowa House passed a bill Wednesday that would ban the use of eminent domain for carbon capture pipelines. It now goes to the Iowa Senate.

In Washington, D.C., Iowa's 3rd District Republican Rep. Zach Nunn and several other Midwestern lawmakers are pushing for year-round E15 in exchange for their votes to approve a $1.2 trillion funding package.

“We have these two battles going: one for our immediate future, one for our long-term future today, and we need to do everything we can to win those battles, or I don't think we're going to like the future very much,” Shaw said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/020163a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+504/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa6%2Fe1%2F35176be9416d93e5b5d5cd7e4db4%2F102122-corn-polk-city-3.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 14:37:12.572604

A recent report highlights that worldwide production could fall 30% to 45% short of the global aviation sector’s 2030 goals due to high production costs, economic uncertainty, and slow adoption rates.

However, given its recent successes in renewable energy and electric vehicles (EV), China is poised, in the near future, to mark a pivotal “take-off” moment for its ambitions in another emerging clean energy frontier: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). China has already demonstrated leadership in maritime decarbonization as an early adopter of sustainable shipping fuels. Now, signs indicate the country’s aviation sector is beginning to follow suit. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) recently established its first technical center dedicated to SAF in Chengdu and successfully completed twelve pilot flights powered by SAF. While domestic SAF demand remains minimal and mandatory targets have yet to be set, these initial steps suggest that China is positioned to significantly reshape the global SAF landscape.

China’s current glut in solar and wind power could help accelerate SAF development. In November 2025 China’s National Energy Administration announced that provinces should use renewable energy to build up new industrial bases for sustainable aviation fuel, green hydrogen and other green fuels during the next five-year plan (2026-2030).

To explore the dynamics shaping China’s SAF industry, I spoke with Dr. Feng An the founder and executive director of the Innovation Center for Energy and Sustainability (iCES), to explore the barriers and potential breakthroughs in China’s SAF landscape.

China is now leading the EVs and batteries. Why has it not followed a similar trajectory for SAF?

Feng An (FA): SAF development in China is still at an early stage. Unlike China’s EVs which boomed with clear and aggressive targets supported by subsidies, production quotas, and infrastructure development, SAF lacks similar incentives and a well-defined policy target. There is an unofficial goal of producing 50,000 tons per year, but that number is minuscule compared to the country’s aviation fuel demand. Moreover, SAF has largely been driven by Europe, specifically the International Civil Aviation Organization’s regulation, which Chinese policymakers perceive as a tool that could be weaponized to curb its economic growth. China will not commit to a target unless it knows it can achieve it, and for now, the leadership does not feel confident in its ability to meet SAF production demands. Additionally, China does not want to pledge to net-zero aviation commitments prematurely, as it prioritizes the continued expansion of its aviation sector. The government remains hesitant to impose stringent sustainability targets that could slow this growth.

What role have Europe and the U.S. played in global SAF development, and how have they interacted with China?

FA: Europe has always led climate regulation, shaping international aviation policies that influence SAF development. China has been cautious about certain regulations and their potential impact on its economic growth. However, although China has not yet pledged to SAF targets, it remains deeply embedded in the global SAF supply chain, primarily through its production of waste cooking oil. The first generation of SAF relies heavily on this feedstock, and China has been a key supplier to Europe and the United States, significantly influencing market dynamics. Large-scale exports from China contributed to lower biodiesel prices, even leading to European anti-dumping measures. As domestic demand for SAF grows, China is beginning to prioritize its own production, which could reshape the global SAF landscape. However, given the currently limited domestic demand for SAF and the vast supply required to replace traditional aviation fuel, the first-generation feedstock, waste cooking oil, can only account for a small proportion of the total need. As a result, China’s SAF development is still in its formative phase.

If waste cooking oil can only meet a small fraction of Chinese domestic and global SAF demand and is considered “the first generation,” what are the medium- and long-term alternatives?

FA: In the medium term, biomass-based fuels like Alcohol-to-Jet (A2J) fuel could play a significant role. The United States is advocating for corn ethanol-based jet fuel, but this approach has sparked debate, particularly between the US and Europe, where regulators are concerned about its impact on land use, food security, and overall sustainability. China may explore a diverse range of biomass sources beyond corn, including agricultural residues, forestry waste, and other non-food biomass feedstocks. For the long term, there is broad consensus that green hydrogen and e-fuels will shape the future of SAF.

What factors could drive China to accelerate SAF development?

FA: China has the potential to replicate its EV success in SAF, but it requires the right policy direction. When China commits to an industry, it scales rapidly and drives down costs. One driver for acceleration will be external pressure. While SAF adoption has been slow, starting in 2030, Chinese airlines flying to Europe will face penalties under the EU’s emissions trading system if they do not use SAF. Cathay Pacific has already introduced voluntary SAF targets to mitigate this risk, but to my knowledge it is the only one. If China sets national blending mandates, requiring airlines to incorporate a percentage of SAF into their fuel supply, it will create a strong market signal. This would incentivize the whole industry, especially state-owned enterprises, to invest in SAF production, leading to a rapid scale-up. Potentially, this could position China as a global leader in the SAF industry, much like it did with EVs.

This helps bring the company in line with fulfilling its World Economic Forum (WEF) First Movers Coalition (FMC) commitment, five years ahead of its schedule.

AVEVA joins other leading companies who are investing in sustainable fuels to support the transition to a cleaner future.

Purchasing SAF for climate impact

As a member of the WEF FMC Aviation group, AVEVA set a target to replace at least 5% of conventional jet fuel demand with SAF.

It purchased SAF certificates from British Airways for use at London Heathrow Airport.

British Airways had previously entered into a multi-year agreement with renewable fuel provider EcoCeres, supporting the airline’s goal to power 10% of its flights with SAF by 2030.

EcoCeres specialises in producing industrial-scale SAF, hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and renewable naphtha.

AVEVA’s software is also used by EcoCeres, being used to optimise the production of SAF.

Caspar Herzberg, CEO of AVEVA, says: “The role of tech and industry in driving decarbonisation has never been clearer.

“By investing in sustainable fuels today, we are demonstrating how climate ambition must be matched by concrete action.

“Through concerted action like this, industries can scale new technologies, minimise lifecycle emissions and set a higher standard for responsible growth.”

What is the First Movers Coalition?

The First Movers Coalition is an initiative launched by the WEF and the US government at COP26, to help decarbonise heavy industry and transport.

These sectors are responsible for 30% of global emissions and the initiative aims to leverage the collective purchasing power of its members.

The FMC’s mission is to accelerate the adoption of emerging climate technologies to build early market demand and encourage their widespread commercial adoption.

At its inception, the FMC had 35 members, which has since grown to more than 100 members who have collectively made more than 125 commitments.

The members of the coalition aim to work together and use their power to decarbonise industry sectors such as aviation, cement and concrete, shipping, steel, trucking and aluminium.

Noam Boussidan, Program Head for the First Movers Coalition at WEF, says: “It is great to see First Movers Coalition members in action today.

“By purchasing SAF as part of its sustainability roadmap, AVEVA continues to show leadership and make meaningful progress toward the fulfillment of its FMC aviation target.

“Partnerships like these demonstrate how First Movers Coalition members are supporting the development and use of cleaner aviation technology while driving corporate climate action.”

AVEVA’s sustainability targets

AVEVA is focused on advancing its sustainability commitment through action, reducing its Scope 1 and 2 operational emissions by more than 93%.

The company is on track to achieve its target of cutting Scope 3 emissions by 50% by 2030.

More than 20,000 enterprises across 100 countries rely on AVEVA’s software to help deliver reliable energy, food, infrastructure and medicines.

Its software allows companies to access trusted information and AI insights, meaning teams can engineer efficiently and optimise operations while meeting their sustainability goals.

Through the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) COP30 procurement initiative, AVEVA reduced the climate impact associated with its COP30 flights.

The EFI Foundation’s October 2025 report, Integrated Product- and Entity-Level Carbon Accounting: Putting Concepts into Practice, presents a comprehensive CO₂ emissions accounting system that integrates principles of financial accounting with engineering fundamentals and introduces a SAF case study using the HEFA process to demonstrate the system in practice. This report provides a more detailed description of that case study.

The case study uses a hypothetical SAF supply chain based on a facility in Great Falls, Montana. The SAF product is combined with conventional jet fuel refined in the same region from Bakken crude oil to create a 50-50 blend that is sold to a commercial airline customer. The study develops detailed mass and energy balances for the hypothetical SAF supply chain, assuming three primary upstream suppliers: a natural gas supplier, an electric utility, and a soybean oil supplier. The SAF production facility converts these inputs into several hydrocarbon products through steam methane reforming and the HEFA process—namely SAF, naphtha, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The SAF is transported by truck to a blending terminal, where it is blended with conventional jet fuel before being delivered via pipeline to a nearby airport.

The results of the case study are presented from three perspectives:

The Engineer’s Perspective: The complete carbon mass and energy balances that provide the foundational data for the accounting ledger, including CO₂ emissions and physical carbon content over the three-month period of operations;

The Accountant’s and Auditor’s Perspective: The CO₂ emissions accounting ledgers of the entities in the supply chain, providing the basis for all entity-level and product-level reports; and

Management and Policymaker Perspectives: Reports of product CO₂ emissions intensity and total CO₂ emissions derived from the ledger data.

This case study demonstrates that a comprehensive CO₂ emissions accounting system enables complete, transparent, and decision-useful carbon reporting. For airline customers, product-level CO₂ intensity data supports strategic planning, marketing, and willingness-to-pay decisions for lower-carbon products. For SAF producers, product-level CO₂ intensity serves as a key performance indicator to identify and evaluate opportunities to reduce emissions through additional decarbonization strategies. The system also provides a complete record of total emissions, with no gaps in coverage, along with complete and transparent allocation of emissions among products. By recording CO₂ emissions once and transferring them from supplier ledgers through the SAF producer to the end customer, the system prevents double counting. Built-in validation checks support accuracy, while a complete and transparent audit trail enables third-party verification and ensures correct allocation of entity-level emissions across products.

This report provides a description of a case study examining an alternative pathway to SAF based on the use of ethanol feedstocks converted to SAF (alcohol to jet, or AtJ).

This SAF-AtJ case study is more complex than the SAF-HEFA case study. The SAF-AtJ pathway includes a supply chain that incorporates several additional decarbonization strategies, namely hydrogen production with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and the purchase of verified carbon removal credits from a third party. The study assumes five primary upstream suppliers: a natural gas supplier, an electric utility, an ethanol producer, a hydrogen producer using autothermal reforming (ATR) with CCS, and a provider of verified carbon removal credits.

Pouyanné statement, made Wednesday during a panel discussion on clean fuels at the WEF annual meeting in Davos, follows the recent announcement by the European Commission that it will remove its requirement for a 100% reduction in CO2 emissions from new cars and vans from 2035, replacing it instead with a requirement for carmakers to meet a 90% tailpipe emissions reduction target.

Pouyanné said:

“Without regulation, there is no market.”

Pouyanné highlighted aspects of the EU’s SAF regulation that he viewed as problematic, most notably the lack of a gradual increase in mandated SAF levels, which are set to jump from 2% to 6% in 2030, which he said would require the company “to overinvest during 5 years just to reach 6%.”

The CEO added that “all the airline companies are fighting” the 2030 6% mandate,” and that the regulation’s subsequent targets “just make zero sense… so we’ll be obliged, I’m sure, to revise.”

Pouyanné said that while the airlines are accusing the company of not investing enough to meet the SAF requirements, the company would have “no problem to invest” and could even provide 10% SAF to the airlines by 2030, but added that “it has a cost, and everyone is dreaming to have this biofuel and clean fuel for the same price as oil.”

Based on his prediction that the EU will water down the SAF mandate, Pouyanné said:

“I will invest less in this thing. I’m afraid that as it’s a regulated market, if they move the targets… the I will have invested in biorefineries for nothing.”

Pouyanné also said that investments in renewable energy presented a much more compelling business case in terms of decarbonization impact, noting that “solar, wind today, in terms of cost of abatement for CO2, it costs $200 per ton of CO2, while biofuels are more like $350, $400 per ton.”

The Naples Airport Authority has released its 2025 Annual Report, noting significant achievements in environmental sustainability, noise abatement, fiscal accountability and other areas.

As a self-sustaining entity, Naples Airport receives no local taxpayer support. It is primarily funded through fuel sales, hangar rentals and other related services.

“2025 was a year of progress and refinement for Naples Airport,” said Chris Rozansky, executive director of the Naples Airport Authority. “In my nearly 10 years here, I don’t think I’ve ever seen so many positive developments and achievements occur over a 12-month period.”

Notable milestones and undertakings cited in the 2025 Annual Report include:

Sustainability: Naples Airport earned the Florida Airports Council’s 2025 Benjamin J. Siwinski Sustainability Award and Florida Recycling Foundation’s 2025 Recycling Champions Award for transformative fuel and fleet electrification initiatives aimed at reducing emissions, improving air quality and promoting sustainability in aviation. Through a partnership with AvFuel, Naples Airport became the first airport on the East Coast to publicly offer a regular supply of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, a cleaner fuel that represented 20% of aviation fuel sales in 2025. The airport received a new Tiger Dam flood barrier system designed to protect buildings, equipment and technology against storm surge. Future resiliency initiatives include improvements to the airport’s fuel farm and airfield lighting systems.

Noise Abatement: After years of study, the FAA approved new flight paths for Naples Airport designed to enhance safety, increase efficiency and reduce noise. Airplanes are now descending at a steeper slope and flying in holding patterns over less populated areas – changes meant to reduce ground noise heard by neighbors. Naples Airport also launched a new app in partnership with EnviroSuite that makes it easier to submit noise complaints.

Safety: Naples Aviation, the sole fixed-base operator (FBO) at the Naples Airport, achieved one of the highest safety milestones in the aviation industry. International Standard for Business Aircraft Handling (IS-BAH) Stage 2 certification from the International Business Aviation Council acknowledges superior safety and efficiency of airport ground services, along with the consistent implementation and maturity of a robust safety management system over time. Operation Final Approach, an FAA-required full-scale emergency training exercise, brought together dozens of first responders, local agencies and airport personnel to prepare for real-world emergencies.

Fiscal Accountability: The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada awarded the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting to the Naples Airport Authority for its Annual Comprehensive Financial Report. It’s the 20th consecutive year that Naples Airport – which currently operates with zero debt – has earned the prestigious award.

Community Engagement: Naples Airport hosted dozens of engagement activities, including Plane Talk information sessions, and sponsored multiple community events. A Community Sentiment Survey, an independent survey conducted by American Pulse, found overwhelming support from Naples and Collier County residents. After survey results were released, the Naples Airport Authority’s Board of Commissioners agreed to table discussions about relocating the airport.

Aviation Leadership: National Air Transportation Association reappointed Executive Director Chris Rozansky to a three-year term on the NATA Board of Directors; he also was named to the Board of Directors of the Florida Airports Council Executive Committee. Deputy Director of Aviation Justin Lobb was elected as vice chair of the Florida Airport’s Council General Aviation Committee and Director of Operations and Maintenance Barry Brown was elected as vice chair of the Florida Airport’s Council Facilities Committee.

Addressing reporters during a recent media event at Gen Phoenix’s factory in Peterborough, UK — where the supplier makes seat covers from recycled leather waste for more than 250 airlines, including Wizz Air — representatives from the airline provided an update on its decarbonization plan, which relies heavily on a massive ramp-up in SAF volumes that has yet to happen.

The net-zero roadmap, unveiled by Wizz Air last year, envisions a 53% reduction in emissions through the use of SAF by 2050, with a further 30% reduction coming from new aircraft technology and fleet renewal. The carrier is “already uplifting 2% SAF”, in line with the European Union’s ReFuelEU requirement, says Wizz Air sustainability team manager Zsuzsanna Dimeny, and has an “aspirational and ambitious target” of 10% SAF by the end of this decade.

Dimeny notes that at 52.2 grams of CO2 per passenger kilometer, Wizz Air’s emissions intensity was one of the lowest in Europe in fiscal year 2025. “Our target is to reduce this by 25% by the end of the decade,” she says.

Dimeny attributes the low emissions intensity to Wizz Air’s average fleet age of 4.7 years and high load factors; its Airbus A321neos are configured with 40 rows and 239 seats. A recent study, co-led by the University of Oxford, suggested that packing more passengers into the most fuel-efficient aircraft and eliminating premium seating could reduce global aviation emissions by as much as three-quarters.

Wizz Air has acknowledged that its longer-term emissions-reduction ambitions are dependent on a significant scaling up of the nascent SAF market. For its part, the airline touts its 2024 investment and 15-year offtake agreement with UK-based start-up Firefly, which is working toward opening a facility in the UK by 2029 that will produce SAF using treated sewage as a feedstock, as evidence of its commitment to using alternative fuels.

But the carrier’s chief corporate officer, Owain Jones, says that for its targets to be met, “we need policymakers to recognize what they need to do to help us get there.” Firefly chief commercial officer Naomi Heming, who also spoke at the Peterborough event, agrees that “we need governments to support the acceleration of SAF technologies so we can get to scale faster.”

Firefly aims to build three plants in three years, says Heming. In addition to the UK facility, it is considering sites in the EU and North America. She envisions cost parity with kerosene within five to 10 years, noting that 60-70% of SAF costs are related to feedstocks, but Firefly’s feedstock — human sewage — is unlimited and takes a “problematic waste stream that needs to be got rid of.” As Heming puts it: “Wherever there are people there’s going to be poo.”

Another way in which Wizz Air and other carriers could further boost their green credentials, says Gen Phoenix chief executive John Kennedy, is to return their used seat covers to be recycled again, instead of sending them to landfill. Gen Phoenix unveiled a fully circular aircraft seat cover at AIX in Hamburg in 2024, and the company tells RGN that its goal is for “all airlines to return” their seat covers for recycling.

Kennedy says the company is “on the cusp of a circular revolution” and is “working with industry leaders on how we manage the logistics.” The product’s durability, however, means it could be a while before airlines are ready to return their used covers.

“The issue is they [Gen Phoenix] do too good a job of making durable covers,” says Jones, adding that “once [recycling seat covers] becomes an issue, it’s certainly something we would discuss.”

Wizz Air is one of Europe’s leading low-cost airlines, with over 250 aircraft in its fleet and flying to around 200 destinations across Europe and the Middle East. Having first flown in May 2004, the airline is now one of the fastest-growing carriers in Europe while operating a modern fleet of Airbus passenger aircraft.

Yet with size comes responsibility, and with the issue of sustainability continuing to be high on the aviation agenda in 2026, the company is no stranger to embracing initiatives in this arena.

On 20 January, Aerospace Global News was invited to spend the day with Wizz Air to learn more about the carrier’s plans for 2026 and understand more about its drive towards sustainability.

Wizz Air and its sustainability projects in 2026

With aviation responsible for generating between 2.5% and 4% of the world’s total carbon emissions, Wizz Air believes that it is down to each airline to do as much as it can to reduce this figure.

Decarbonisation is the key to the future, the airline believes, and it is working hard to reduce its own carbon footprint.

While aircraft technology will go some way to reducing this future, says Wizz Air, other initiatives and ideas must also be embraced to expedite the industry towards reaching its widely publicised goal of achieving net zero by 2050.

“Decarbonisation and reaching net zero by 2050 are the long-term goals,” explained Owain Jones, the Chief Corporate Officer of Wizz Air. “While the foundations are there, there lies a long road ahead of us,” he added.

To this end, Wizz Air is following several paths that will steer it towards reaching its own sustainability targets while also keeping a firm eye on 2050.

From operating modern aircraft to encouraging the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and from using recycled leather to cover its aircraft seats to working alongside Airbus to reduce the fuel burn of its aircraft, Wizz Air is striving towards a position where its carbon footprint is as low as it can be, while continuing to operate efficiently and safely.

A pathway towards decarbonisation for Wizz Air

In April 2025, Wizz Air unveiled its ambitions for Net Zero 2050. The plan highlighted slow progress and called for radical change to shape the aviation industry’s future.

According to the company, the roadmap offered “a realistic path towards Net Zero 2050” by focusing on the ‘three Fs’ –

Flights (30% emissions reduction from new aircraft technology and fleet renewal

Fuel (53% in emissions reductions to be achieved by using SAF)

Footprint (4% emissions reductions from air traffic management modernisation).

Modern aircraft means a more sustainable fleet

With around 250 aircraft within the Wizz Air group of airlines, the carrier has built up a fleet of modern and efficient aircraft. While older A320 and A321ceo aircraft still fly for the carrier, these are all due to have left the company by 2028, leaving the fleet dominated by the ultra-efficient sharklet-equipped Airbus A321neo, in which the airline believes it has found its ideal aircraft.

The average age of the current Wizz Air fleet is just 4.7 years, making it one of the youngest in Europe and “certainly one of the most efficient”, said Jones.

This figure is due to drop further over the next 12-24 months as even more new aircraft arrive to replace the older generation Airbus jets that remain within the carrier’s fleet, he added. By the end of the financial year 2025, the carrier’s fleet comprised of 72% of the updated neo technology aircraft.

Wizz Air is keen to promote the A321neos ‘green’ credentials. The type offers a nosier reduction of around 50% over its older counterparts – key when operating from airports close to residential areas as well as overflying built-up areas.

Additionally, the Airbus A321neo offers a 20% reduction in fuel consumption and a 50% reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions, all key factors when the company came to ordering new aircraft to replace its older fleet a few years ago.

In terms of emissions, Wizz Air says it wants to reduce emissions by 25% by 2030, a figure that it says should be achievable as more A321neos arrive. Wizz Air has one of the lowest carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions values of any airline in Europe, recording a figure of 52 grams per revenue passenger kilometre (g/RPK) in the fiscal year 2025.

This figure was helped by the high-density seating layout of its A321neos (239 passengers in a single-class layout) while operating at higher-than-average load factors, meaning more flights depart with fewer empty seats. Wizz Air currently operates with a 94% load factor.

“Even empty seats have a cost in terms of environmental penalty,” explained Jones, as they still contribute to the overall weight of the aircraft. “Sharing the cost of the flight among more passengers brings that grams per PRK figure downwards,” he added.

Wizz Air adjusts operations to reduce carbon emissions

Working alongside Airbus, the airline is continuing to develop new ways to reduce its carbon footprint. In 2025, the carrier introduced new flight software that could create more direct routings for pilots.

This has resulted in shorter flying times, less holding and reduced fuel burn. With engines running for a shorter time on each flight, fewer emissions result and the airline’s carbon footprint is reduced.

Similarly, the airline has been working hard on its flight planning function. While the carrier acknowledges that the take-off and landing phase of flight are the most inefficient in terms of fuel burn, Wizz Air said that it works to reduce the number of take-offs and landings aircraft perform each day.

Employing a point-to-point network policy rather than a hub-and-spoke model, which generally results in more cycles per aircraft, leading to increased emissions. With numerous airspace modernisation strategies proceeding around Europe, this will help airlines reduce time and the need for holding patterns at the busiest airports

It also employs a paperless cockpit policy, eradicating the need for heavy hard copy flight manuals and replacing them with tablet-based manuals for the flight crew. Not only does this cut down the weight of the aircraft, but it also reduces the amount of paper needed to be used to produce the manuals themselves.

Wizz Air is driving forward the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

While the widespread use of SAF has very much been stifled by a lack of supply in recent years, Wizz Air is working to change that. With its modern fleet already certified to operate using a 50% blend of SAF, the carrier is looking to the future when this number can be increased significantly, both through the easing of manufacturing and supply channels as well as through regulation. Wizz Air has set an aspirational target to power 10% of its flights with SAF by 2030.

“While the Pratt & Whitney engines on our A321neos are already capable of running perfectly safely on a 50% blend, we would like to use more”, explained Zsuzsanna Dimeny, Head of Sustainability at Wizz Air.

“We are adhering to the Refuel EU and UK SAF mandates; we are unable to commit beyond those presently due to the overriding cost and availability constraints,” she added.

That said, Wizz Air has started preparing for the upcoming EU mandates review by partnering with several SAF suppliers as well as making its first equity investments in SAF-related businesses.

Wizz Air has supported the UK-based biofuel company, Firefly, since 2023. The partnership allows the airline to supply up to 525,000 tonnes of SAF over a period of 15 years to Wizz Air’s UK operations from 2028.

Similarly, in 2023, Wizz Air joined a $50 million investment round in CleanJoule, a US-based biofuel startup company aiming to significantly increase the amount of SAF currently being produced. However, as cited by Dimeny, the prohibitive factor to SAF usage is cost, with SAF currently equating to around four to five times the cost of normal kerosene jet fuel.

Unless this changes, she added, it is hard for low-cost carriers such as Wizz Air to swallow this cost, regardless of any good intentions that may exist.

According to Naomi Henning, Chief Commercial Officer at Firefly, the key to unlocking the production of larger volumes of SAF is investment.

“It will take a large amount of investment from key stakeholders, including governments, to make this happen. But that is an investment that must be made if net-zero targets are to be achieved,” she added.

How using recycled leather for seat covers is reducing landfill

Even away from the activity of flying aircraft, Wizz Air has become something of a pioneer in terms of pursuing sustainable goals.

One such example of this is the company’s longstanding partnership with Gen Phoenix. This Peterborough-based firm utilises offcuts from the leather manufacturing industry and, rather than casting them to landfill, the company repurposes them for use as high-quality seat covers onboard Wizz Air planes.

As explained by John Kennedy, the UK company’s CEO, “Gen Phoenix is delivering a new generation of materials for a new era of sustainability. Through our revolutionary circular process, we rescue leather offcuts destined for landfill and regenerate them into a premium alternative leather material coveted for its durability.”

Kennedy added that since the company’s founding in 2007, Gen Pheonix has diverted thousands of tons of material from landfill and has created thousands of new products, including aircraft and other transport seat covers, luggage items, and even covers for Amazon Kindle devices. In terms of manufacturing seat covers for Wizz Air, Gen Phoenix states :

78% less carbon emissions are produced if Wizz Air bought real leather seats

Water consumption is a 87% reduction from traditional leather manufacruting with 95% being recycled water.

Waste savings of 17 tonnes from the supplied quantity of 1,000,000 m2

Carbon savings of 7,300 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year due to the weight reduction of the final product

The entire Wizz fleet now uses Gen Phoenix seating materials

How the process works

The process to turn waste leather into a reusable leather product is multistage, but one that Wizz Air has supported since 2012. The end result sees Gen Pheonix produce the thick leather-like covers that are then dyed and used to cover the seats on all the carrier’s Airbus aircraft.

Initially, large bundles of leather waste are rescued from other leather goods manufacturers and is broken down by machines at Gen Phoenix into smaller flakes. These flakes (or ‘trimmings’) are then granulated into smaller pieces and milled into soft fibres. Heated and compressed, the lather is then rolled into sheets of uniform leather fibre web.

Once done, two layers of fibre web and textile core are woven together using highly pressurised water before being bathed in natural oils to replenish properties lost during the tanning process. Lastly, coatings are applied to the leather fibre based on the customers’ colour, feel and finish requirements.

Wizz Air is clearly proud of its association with Gen Pheonix, having relied on the company to produce the seat covers for all its A321neo aircraft. The seat covers are light, saving on aircraft weight, durable and can be easily cleaned rather than replaced – again, saving Wizz Air money in terms of cost and reducing waste into the environment.

Kennedy added that Gen Phoenix’s partnership with Wizz Air has been advantageous for the environment. “We have achieved economies of scale with Wizz Air, he said. “Sustainability ultimately relies on scale, and our customers all believe that they are doing the right thing for sustainability by using our product for their requirements, including Wizz Air.

Wizz Air partners with London Luton Airport to work towards sustainability goals

As Wizz Air’s largest UK base, as well as the home base for its UK-based airline Wizz Air UK, London Luton Airport (LTN) has played a massive role in the airline’s growth over the years. Indeed, its first flight departed from the airport in May 2004.

Not resting on its laurels, the airport is working hand-in-hand with its largest airline customer to ensure that together, the companies continue to work towards net-zero goals.

According to David Vazquez, the airport’s Head of Sustainability, the growth in sustainability at the airport relies on airlines such as Wizz Air continuing to use the airport’s facilities and bringing passengers through the airport’s terminals.

“We have employed various means by which Wizz Air has been able to benefit from pursuing sustainability goals and be ‘greener’. From converting five aircraft stands at the airport into electric-only stands and the increased use of electric vehicles, we are cutting down our carbon emissions on the airfield itself, which is good for the wider airport community in the Luton area.

Vazque also explained that the airport is to complete a new solar farm on the south side of the airport by the end of 2026, which will provide around 50% of the energy required by the airport to serve its customers. He added that the facility seeks to be net zero by 2040, but can only do this with the support of its customer airlines.

Wizz Air – believing in sustainability for a better future

The airline has been investing heavily in sustainability initiatives in recent years, which it believes will serve its customers and the planet well in the coming decades.

While partnering with key stakeholders such as Gen Phoenix, London Luton Airport, Firefly and Airbus, the airline believes that it can meet its sustainability goals in the long term as long as it stays focused.

“Sustainability is not an issue that is going away, and there is a large amount of self-help that companies such as Wizz Air need to employ to meet their goals in this regard,” said Owain Jones. “The period of ‘play and-pay’ is long gone. Airlines such as Wizz Air need to tackle the problems at the source rather than reacting to them.”

“Throughout its existence, Wizz Air has always been supportive of sustainability issues, and we are actively doing something about them through these various initiatives, Jones added. “At the end of the day, it is all about earning the customer’s trust. We realise that passengers have a choice and believe that increasingly they will choose an airline that they know is being responsible in terms of sustainability issues.

Predicting the Maximum Loading in Zeolites for Hydroisomerization Applications: A Machine Learning Approach

Hydroisomerization for kerosene and sustainable aviation fuel relies on zeolite catalysts, making accurate predictions of hydrocarbon loading essential. This work develops a two‑stage machine‑learning cascade: a gradient-boosted classifier determines whether adsorption occurs, followed by a regressor predicting maximum loading. The dataset spans 45 alkane isomers (up to C16) and 97 zeolites, with descriptors capturing pore geometry, topology, molecular size, and composite physicochemical features. Several regressors are tested, with TabPFN achieving the best generalization and lowest error. Interpretability analysis shows that the model prioritizes physically meaningful descriptors while also capturing shape-based selectivity effects. Although robust to random data splits, the regressor overfits when test fractions are very small. Compared with an artificial neural network, the cascade trains faster but requires more memory. Combined with prior Henry coefficient predictions, this framework enables full adsorption‑isotherm reconstruction and mixture analysis via IAST.

The agreement also includes an option for Trafigura to purchase additional volumes from Syzygy’s future projects, offering potential to supply a meaningful volume of compliant SAF to meet regulatory mandates.

The milestone comes at a pivotal moment for aviation, as expanding SAF mandates intersect with tightening availability of sustainable feedstocks. Syzygy’s solution addresses these constraints by combining abundant biogas with renewable electricity in a modular, electrified platform.

“This agreement marks a critical step in our journey toward commercial-scale impact and disrupting the SAF market,” said Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics.

“With a signed offtake agreement from a global leader like Trafigura and after having successfully completed FEED engineering in December, we’re now ready to secure financing for the construction of NovaSAF-1 and move our technology from potential into production.”

Syzygy’s first commercial-scale project, named NovaSAF-1, will be located in Durazno, Uruguay and will be the world's first electrified biogas-to-SAF facility producing RFNBO compliant SAF.

The agreement has been executed through Syzygy’s subsidiary, SP Developments Uruguay S.A., and represents one of the most significant commercial validations of Syzygy’s light-driven reactor technology to date. Under the terms of the deal, Trafigura will purchase the full production output from Syzygy’s first commercial SAF facility, NovaSAF-1, with initial deliveries expected to begin in 2028. In addition, the agreement provides Trafigura with an option to acquire volumes from Syzygy’s future SAF projects, creating the potential for long-term, scalable supply of compliant SAF for global aviation markets.

This development comes at a critical time for the aviation industry, as governments worldwide expand SAF blending mandates while the availability of sustainable feedstocks continues to tighten. These constraints have been highlighted in multiple industry assessments, including long-term outlooks that warn of increasing competition for limited resources such as used cooking oil and other waste-based inputs. Syzygy’s approach directly addresses this challenge by utilizing widely available biogas combined with renewable electricity in a modular, electrified production platform. At commercial scale, this model is expected to be highly cost-competitive and, in some cases, more economically attractive than conventional SAF pathways that depend on feedstocks with limited supply.

Marketed under the NovaSAF™ brand, Syzygy’s production pathway has already achieved ISCC pre-certification, enabling the manufacture of Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO) and Advanced BioSAF-compliant fuels. This certification is particularly relevant for Europe, the United Kingdom, and other regions that have set ambitious decarbonization targets for aviation by 2030. By offering an alternative, scalable SAF route, Syzygy’s technology expands the range of solutions available to regulators and fuel consumers seeking to reduce aviation emissions.

According to Trevor Best, the agreement represents a decisive step toward large-scale commercialization. He noted that securing a binding offtake arrangement with a global player such as Trafigura, combined with the successful completion of Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) in December, positions the company to move forward with project financing and construction. With these elements in place, Syzygy is transitioning from technology development to full commercial deployment.

The NovaSAF-1 project itself will be located in Durazno, Uruguay, and is expected to become the world’s first electrified biogas-to-SAF facility producing RFNBO-compliant fuel. The plant will source biogas from the Estancias Del Lago powdered milk facility and use Uruguay’s renewable electricity grid to produce synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK). The resulting SAF is projected to deliver lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reductions of up to 90% compared with conventional fossil-based jet fuel, while maintaining strong project economics.

From Trafigura’s perspective, the agreement aligns closely with its broader low-carbon fuels strategy. Jason Breslaw emphasized that diversifying SAF supply is essential as regulatory requirements become more stringent. Leveraging Trafigura’s global distribution network, the company aims to help aviation customers meet compliance obligations efficiently and at competitive cost, while supporting innovative production pathways such as Syzygy’s biogas-to-SAF model.

With the NovaSAF-1 blueprint now established, Syzygy plans to replicate this project model internationally. Having completed FEL 3 engineering, the company’s next major milestone is raising capital to fund construction, paving the way for broader global commercialization and accelerated deployment of cost-effective SAF production worldwide.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-22 10:37:44.949420

In 2025, we took one of our biggest steps yet, signing a multi-year agreement with Phillips 66 for more than 240,000 metric tons of SAF.
Produced in California and primarily serving our US West Coast operations, the fuel is expected to reduce lifecycle emissions by around 737,000 metric tons of GHG emissions over three years.
That switch enables an estimated reduction of 25,000 metric tons of carbon emissions in the full lifecycle of fuel emissions.
For us, it represents a blueprint for future logistics hubs – combining operational resilience, energy self-sufficiency, and long-term sustainability.","We know that decarbonizing logistics isn’t about a single solution. It’s about tackling emissions across air, sea, road, and infrastructure – often in parallel, often in places where change is hardest to implement. Some initiatives take years to scale, others start as pilots, and all require close collaboration across industries.

Looking back at 2025, these five selected examples represent only part of a much broader set of actions across DHL. Together, they show how we are translating climate ambition into action.

Air freight plays a vital role in global trade – and it’s also one of the most carbon-intensive parts of logistics. That’s why we’ve been investing in sustainable aviation fuel since 2021. In 2025, we took one of our biggest steps yet, signing a multi-year agreement with Phillips 66 for more than 240,000 metric tons of SAF.

Produced in California and primarily serving our US West Coast operations, the fuel is expected to reduce lifecycle emissions by around 737,000 metric tons of GHG emissions over three years. For us, it marked a major move from early adoption toward real scale – and a sign of how partnerships can accelerate change where it matters most.

Ocean freight moves the majority of goods worldwide, making maritime decarbonization a critical piece of the puzzle. In 2025, we partnered with CMA CGM to purchase 8,800 metric tons of sustainable marine fuel (SMF) in the form of second-generation biofuel made from used cooking oil (UCOME).

That switch enables an estimated reduction of 25,000 metric tons of carbon emissions in the full lifecycle of fuel emissions. It’s a practical example of how collaboration across the shipping ecosystem can help push low-carbon solutions into everyday operations.

While electric vehicles work well for many delivery routes, long-haul transport relies on a broader mix of solutions. That’s why we’ve been actively testing hydrogen-powered trucks across Europe, North America, and Asia Pacific – and in 2025, expanded that work into the Middle East.

Following a memorandum of understanding with Hyperview in Saudi Arabia, we began preparations for a hydrogen truck pilot aligned with Saudi Vision 2030. Alongside vehicle testing, the project includes a feasibility study for hydrogen infrastructure – a necessary step toward making low-emission logistics viable in emerging markets.

The last mile is where logistics meets everyday life – and where decarbonization can have an immediate impact. In 2025, Germany took a major step forward when we announced the purchase of 2,400 new electric vans for our Post & Parcel Germany division.

With most vehicles already in operation, one-third of all German postcodes are now served by carbon-emissions-free last-mile delivery. Powered by a fleet of more than 35,000 electric vehicles – including e-vans and e-bikes – this milestone shows how large-scale electrification can move from ambition to daily reality.

Decarbonization doesn’t stop at vehicles. In 2025, we continued rethinking how logistics facilities themselves are powered. In Thailand, we launched a solar-powered warehouse designed to generate 100% of its energy on-site.

Equipped with a 4.2-megawatt-peak solar array and advanced battery storage, the facility operates independently of fossil-based grid electricity. For us, it represents a blueprint for future logistics hubs – combining operational resilience, energy self-sufficiency, and long-term sustainability.",https://www.dhl.com/content/dam/dhl/global/delivered/images/social-share-1200x630/r195-dl-sustainability.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 10:37:50.328497

How did EPA justify this rulemaking, and what does RFF analysis have to say about the EPA analysis?
As such, EPA’s analysis is not a benefit-cost analysis, but rather a cost analysis.","By now, everyone involved in US environmental policy is familiar with the sweeping regulatory changes the Trump administration has proposed in its first year. Relevant federal agencies from across the executive branch have proposed new rules (and, in some cases, tweaked, revised, and fully repealed existing rules), with executive actions on climate policy receiving special scrutiny. Core agencies such as the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the US Department of Energy (DOE) have fundamentally changed the interpretation of long-standing rules and precedents that established decarbonization programs and standards. Along with reconsidering legal precedent, the agencies also have put forth new and questionable interpretations of scholarship, including the work of Resources for the Future (RFF) researchers.

Our scholars have been swift to respond when opportunities for formal public comment have arisen—often with a correction to governmental regulatory analysis but always with a focus on the rigorous and comprehensive assessment of costs and benefits and related outcomes that is fundamental to our mission. Analysis-based responses to government proposals, informed by insightful discussions with stakeholders and policymakers, are at the core of how RFF ensures that environmental and climate regulations are grounded in the best available evidence.

This fall, RFF hosted an Insights Hour event—a periodic informal discussion with RFF stakeholders and donors—focused exclusively on the public comments RFF experts submitted in response to three key administration efforts: (1) EPA’s proposed repeal of greenhouse gas emissions standards for fossil fuel–based electric power generation; (2) a report produced last year by DOE’s Climate Working Group that questioned the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions on the US climate (and, in turn, related economic outcomes) that was cited extensively in those emissions standards; and (3) an EPA proposal to eliminate vehicle emissions standards along with, more profoundly, the underlying endangerment finding that serves as the basis for the agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

RFF Senior Fellow and Director of RFF’s Electric Power Program Karen Palmer led an insightful discussion with Senior Fellow Joshua Linn, Fellow Brian C. Prest, and Research Associate Nick Roy about how and why RFF engages in public comments. The following is an annotated transcript of the event.

This Insights Hour event took place on September 30, 2025. The original transcript of the discussion has been edited for length and clarity.

Karen Palmer: The subject today is how RFF informs the regulatory process through public comments on recent regulations and related actions by the administration—including some proposed regulatory repeals from EPA on fossil fuel power plants, vehicle emissions standards, and the overall endangerment finding, based on a recent report about climate change from a Climate Working Group established by DOE, to which RFF has submitted a comment. All these comments are published on the RFF website and focus entirely on the analyses of economic costs and benefits from these proposed regulatory changes.

Let me start out with Brian and your public comment on the report that was produced by the Climate Working Group established by DOE. I want to discuss your review of the chapter on economics and the social cost of carbon (SCC). Can you tell me about what that chapter said and your reaction?

Brian C. Prest: While much of the report was about the physical science of climate change, one of the 12 chapters focused solely on the economics of climate change and the SCC. This subject is of course squarely in RFF’s wheelhouse. Basically, this chapter had two sections: one on the SCC and another about the impacts of climate change on the economy.

The SCC section was broadly dismissive of the idea of estimating the SCC and made several misleading or simply false claims. What’s particularly interesting is that the chapter didn’t acknowledge much of the core progress made in environmental economics over the past decade or so, and instead mostly focused on old and outdated research.

For instance, the working group didn’t cite the landmark 2017 National Academies report that prompted RFF to establish the SCC Initiative that same year. They also didn’t acknowledge any of the research that the National Academies inspired, such as more than a dozen peer-reviewed studies over the past decade that were part of the efforts of RFF and the Climate Impact Lab. They made one passing reference to the widely lauded efforts by EPA in 2023, but in doing so, made the astonishing and unsubstantiated claim that EPA’s work did not represent any new data or methods relative to old models, even though that effort in fact built a brand new integrated assessment model from the ground up.

In short, the DOE working group didn’t really engage with the major advances of SCC research over the past decade or so. My public comment highlights this major deficiency with the analysis, and corrects erroneous claims in the report, like confusing the concepts of social costs and external costs.

Palmer: I also understand that, while they didn’t cite RFF’s major work on the SCC, they did cite one of your papers, which was coauthored with former RFF President and CEO Richard G. Newell. How well did their summary represent the results of your paper?

Prest: Right! Our 2021 paper was written in part as a critique of a high-profile 2015 paper that, in our view, strongly overstated the expected adverse impacts of climate change on economic growth. Most existing research estimates the effects of climate change on the level of GDP, while our 2015 paper instead estimates the impacts on its growth rate.

We point out in our paper that growth-rate methods are very sensitive to model specifications, which raises concern about the reliability of the models, but we also found that methods focusing on GDP levels yield much smaller but much more robust estimates that are closely in line with other research.

Nonetheless, the report from the DOE Climate Working Group cites only the less robust set of models in our paper, concluding that the effect of climate change on GDP growth is statistically noisy but “likely positive” on net, while ignoring the more reliable set of models that yield the opposite conclusion. But if you consider the set of models that we found to be more robust, you get the reverse conclusion that the impacts are likely negative, with a 92 percent likelihood of climate change hurting the economy—the opposite of what the DOE working group describes in its report.

In short, our study was meant as a warning against overinterpreting noisy growth-rate models, but the DOE report went on to commit the very same error.

Palmer: The DOE Climate Working Group report is heavily cited in EPA’s proposed rescission of the 2009 endangerment finding, which concluded that greenhouse gases negatively affect public health and welfare and that emissions can be regulated through the Clean Air Act. To remind everyone, the endangerment finding came from the landmark 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA Supreme Court case that focused on vehicle emissions standards.

Let’s turn to our transportation expert, Joshua Linn, about the proposed removal of these standards and how the recently proposed reversal has been justified economically. In 2024, EPA set greenhouse gas standards that would have cut emissions rates in half between 2026 and 2032. This year, EPA has proposed eliminating the standards altogether. How did the agency justify this complete reversal?

Joshua Linn: EPA justifies the proposed reversal largely on the grounds of consumer benefits. Specifically, the proposal asserts that, although consumers would have higher fuel costs, vehicles would be much less expensive, leaving consumers better off overall. But the draft of EPA’s regulatory impact analysis associated with the proposal misinterprets findings from past research, causing the proposal to overstate the net benefits of revoking vehicle emissions standards.

Several assumptions about manufacturer behavior and market outcomes, such as the relationship between compliance costs and regulatory stringency, remain unclear or unjustified in EPA’s recent analysis, causing the proposal’s approach to depart from historical methods for estimating vehicle technology costs, without explanation. Further, the proposal’s analysis relies on obsolete data that are inconsistent with recent market information.

Palmer: In the past, EPA has claimed that consumers would benefit from lower gasoline expenditures. Now, EPA claims consumers are better off without the standards. What has changed?

Linn: EPA clearly is taking a different regulatory and policy approach under the current administration. But we can also see a difference in the analytical methods and rigor that EPA is using to justify the changes. This reduced rigor is true for the analysis of consumer behaviors.

For example, the EPA proposal states that manufacturers and industry should report payback periods of 2.5 years. For a consumer choosing between a fuel-efficient, more expensive vehicle and an inefficient, less expensive vehicle, this number means that a consumer would buy the fuel-efficient vehicle if the first 2.5 years of fuel cost savings justify a higher purchase price. This conclusion differs markedly from past arguments and from contemporary analysis.

In our response, we offer two arguments as to why the 2.5-year payback period is inappropriate. On the one hand, EPA argues that including the first 2.5 years of fuel cost savings accounts for the missing costs related to consumer adoption of electric vehicles; for example, range anxiety. In arguing that EPA’s 2024 standards amount to an electric vehicle mandate, EPA should use an estimate of missing costs that corresponds specifically to electric vehicles. However, the sources that EPA uses appear to predate the rise of electric vehicles in the US market and hence current evidence about such missing costs. For that reason, using the 2.5-year payback period to approximate missing costs of battery-powered electric vehicles is not supported by evidence.

More to the point, some of my research has directly estimated consumer valuation of fuel cost savings, specifically when manufacturers add fuel-saving technologies to the vehicles they offer. During the early 2010s, these technologies included things such as cylinder deactivation. If some costs indeed were missing, those costs would be uncovered in our valuation estimate as deviations from the actual market value of the saved fuel. However, our preferred valuation estimate is consistent with a 7-year payback period. No missing costs from that period would cause consumers to insist on a 2.5-year payback period.

EPA’s assumption of an appropriate payback period is one example of how the proposal undervalues the benefits of the emissions standards. The misinterpretation, in turn, has caused the EPA analysis to overstate the net benefits of revoking the greenhouse gas standards.

Palmer: If EPA goes ahead and revokes the standards, how would the industry respond in the next few years?

Linn: Without the incentive of things like tax credits, manufacturer responses to a repeal of emissions standards will vary.

If a manufacturer offers two vehicles that are identical to each other, except one is gasoline and the other is electric, and the two vehicles have the same lifetime ownership cost, most consumers will choose the gasoline vehicle. In this case, the missing cost is the monetary value of the disutility that the consumer gets with the electric vehicle instead of the gasoline vehicle. The missing cost makes it harder for the manufacturer to comply with greenhouse gas standards, because the automaker has to offer a discount on the electric vehicle.

Emissions standards historically have incentivized manufacturers to reduce the average emissions rates of their vehicles, and the manufacturer response to eliminating the standards likely won’t be a reversion to past behaviors.

This note about manufacturer responses brings up another concern with the proposal’s analysis regarding its comparison cases. In the case of the proposal, EPA also should justify its assumptions about manufacturer behavior and market outcomes if the agency revokes the standards. For example, EPA compares the outcomes from the scenario of maintaining the 2024 standards versus reverting to 2021 standards—but the proposal seeks to remove standards altogether. That’s one example of the ways in which EPA’s approach departs from widely accepted methods for estimating vehicle technology costs; omits explanation and justification of key assumptions, such as the relationship between compliance costs and regulatory stringency; and relies on obsolete data that are inconsistent with market estimates.

It’s good to remind folks that the vehicle emissions standard was the channel for the endangerment finding in 2009, and repeal of the standard is tied to reversing the endangerment finding. But a preponderance of evidence since 2009 confirms that greenhouse gas emissions have significant negative effects on public health and welfare. So, a much broader legal question needs to be addressed, in addition to the technical omissions and errors in economic analysis that RFF has documented.

Palmer: Along with greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, EPA has proposed reversals of emissions-reduction requirements from the electric power sector, specifically questioning Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. Let’s turn to Nick Roy, who conducted much of RFF’s analysis on the proposal. Nick, can you give us some history that led to this current state of affairs?

Nick Roy: EPA has gone back and forth for decades on how to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel–powered electricity generators. The first proposal actually was legislative and goes back to the failed Waxman-Markey bill in 2009. This failed bill motivated executive action years later with EPA’s Clean Power Plan, which was finalized in 2015 but repealed in 2019 and replaced with a proposed Affordable Clean Energy Rule. At the same time, several judicial decisions, such as the West Virginia v. EPA Supreme Court case in 2022, redefined the legal framework for regulating greenhouse gas emissions from power facilities.

Ultimately, the Affordable Clean Energy Rule was repealed in 2024 and replaced with EPA’s Carbon Pollution Standards, which set emissions benchmarks and a range of compliance technologies such as carbon capture and storage, cofiring, and reduced electricity generation. With the change in administration and Congress in 2025, the Carbon Pollution Standards have been repealed.

So, we’re talking about a lot of swings in legislation, executive orders, program rules, and legal decisions. Ultimately, these swings have led to major uncertainties that make planning among electricity providers more difficult and likely lead to increasing costs for consumers.

Palmer: So now, we effectively have no EPA regulation on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. How did EPA justify this rulemaking, and what does RFF analysis have to say about the EPA analysis?

Roy: In its proposal, EPA reused the benefit-cost analysis in the regulatory impact analysis generated for the 2024 Carbon Pollution Standards but assumed no climate damages and excluded any health benefits from reductions in conventional air pollutants. Put another way, EPA does not quantify benefits lost from increased emissions as a result of the proposed repeal, neither from the increase in local air pollutants that cause the premature deaths of Americans nor from the increase in greenhouse gas emissions and the resulting effect on climate change. Instead, EPA’s benefit-cost analysis considers only the estimated $19 billion in avoided compliance costs from lifting the rule. As such, EPA’s analysis is not a benefit-cost analysis, but rather a cost analysis.

RFF’s analysis fills information gaps in two important ways. We’ve updated assumptions about future electricity demand using forecasts from 2025 instead of 2023, and we’ve itemized the benefits of both reduced climate change effects and avoided health costs. We find that the increased health damages alone from the repeal are two to four times the size of the electricity cost savings. Factoring in the costs of climate change, the costs from the repeal are about four to eight times higher than any avoided compliance costs.

Palmer: Without the Carbon Pollution Standards, how would we expect the power sector to change in the coming years?

Roy: The most immediate effect is that many coal- and gas-powered electricity plants will stay online longer and be retired more slowly, even when, as other research finds, many of those power plants are otherwise costly to maintain and operate.

But the level of uncertainty is increasing across electricity markets in general, with massive demand growth from data centers and electrification, variable tariffs that increase the costs of building new power plants, and the fact that methane prices are still subject to global volatility. A range of other factors, such as the permitting process for new electricity transmission and distribution, will challenge EPA’s assumptions about energy costs, too. In the end, this uncertainty has costs that likely are passed on to ratepayers.

Palmer: Finally, an underlying question of the endangerment finding proposal that bridges analytical and legal arguments: Are emissions from any specific sector “significant” contributors? Brian, you have analyzed the evolution of measuring significance. Can you close us out with your findings?

Prest: Sure. A key justification that EPA gave for repealing the carbon pollution standards on power plants was that the sector’s greenhouse gas emissions did not “significantly contribute” to air pollution, on the grounds that its 1.5 billion or so tons of annual carbon dioxide emissions represent about 3 percent of the global total, which EPA deemed insignificant.

However, neither EPA nor the Clean Air Act statute provide a quantitative rationale for what it means to be “significant,” so EPA’s proposed repeal explicitly emphasizes that its conclusion effectively was a judgment call by this particular EPA administrator.

But from an economic and legal perspective, long-standing quantitative thresholds determine what makes for “economically significant” regulations. Those thresholds (for instance, from Executive Order 12866 in 1993 and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995) are commonly pegged at about $100 million–$200 million in annual impacts on the economy, public health, or the environment. Putting environmental impacts into dollar terms is a long-standing practice in economics, and in the case of climate change, this translation of carbon damages into dollar terms is what the SCC does.

SCC estimates vary (our previous work gives a central estimate of $185 per ton of carbon dioxide), but in our comments, we made the straightforward point that, under basically any estimate of the SCC, emissions from the US power sector clearly are economically significant and vastly exceed the well-established $100 million–$200 million threshold.

The math is pretty simple: Even at a minimal $1 per ton of carbon dioxide—the lowest value used by the first Trump administration—the economic impact of the US power sector’s 1.5 billion tons of annual carbon dioxide emissions is measured in the billions of dollars. But using more realistic estimates of the SCC, the impacts of carbon emissions amount to tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars annually.

Palmer: Answers to the analytical questions we have posed clearly are fundamental to how we pursue policy in this country. Thanks to my fellow researchers for bringing their tremendous expertise to bear, not just to RFF and to the broader community of environmental policy stakeholders, but also toward improving policy in the United States.",https://media.rff.org/images/Evidence_and_policy_Insights_Hour_-_Palmer_et_.width-600.png,N,,2026-01-22 10:37:55.092878

“If India adopts ethanol for cooking fuel, that’s another area.
If we can get 10%, that’s 400 million gallons,” Wilson said.","BLOOMINGTON, Ill. — U.S. corn exports continued at record pace through the end of 2025, while the future global demand potential for ethanol remains bright.

Collin Watters, IL Corn director of exports and logistics, and Mark Wilson, west-central Illinois farmer near Toulon and U.S. Grains and BioProducts Council chairman, gave their outlooks on trade, transportation and global grain markets at the recent Farm Assets Conference.

When asked what the best option was for future corn demand outside the United States, Wilson said “ethanol,” with out hesitation.

He recalled his recent conversation with Doug Bergen, POET vice president of corporate affairs.

“He’s more excited now that he’s ever been with the potential for ethanol,” Wilson said at the University of Illinois Extension-hosted conference.

Much of the excitement centers around other countries adopting ethanol policies of 10% or 15% mixes in their fuel.

“India is going to 20% ethanol in their fuels. The big one, nobody’s talking about, which could be huge, is maritime fuels. Maris, which is the No. 2 shipping company in the world, uses 6 billion gallons of fuel a year. They’re doing a test right now with an engine that will do half methanol, half ethanol,” Wilson said.

“There’s a lot of talk that they want to get out of this bunker crude, which is dirty, black, smokey fuel. That could be a huge market, because that’s No. 2.”

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration data, fuel ethanol exports to India reached 3.539 million barrels between January and September of 2025, averaging nearly 400,000 barrels monthly.

“If India adopts ethanol for cooking fuel, that’s another area. Right now they’re using dung cakes, sticks and coal to cook with in a lot of the villages. We’ve done studies on it, and if 1% of the people in India adopt clean-burning ethanol cook stoves, that’s 40 million gallons of ethanol right there. If we can get 10%, that’s 400 million gallons,” Wilson said.

Japan is also a large a growing market for ethanol demand.

“They’re going to E10 with their gasoline, and when they get to E10, which they say will be by 2030, that’s a 1 billion gallon market. Right now we’re shipping 100 million gallons over there. That’s a potential billion gallon market. And they will probably source 85% of that ethanol from the U.S., because they don’t want to put all their eggs in one basket,” Wilson said.

“Japan also has a goal of 10% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030, and I think everybody knows they’re not going to be able to make that. That’s just too big of a jump, but they are on a path to get that done and to work through that.

“Japan is pushing hard on this, and they’re pushing that they think that alcohol-to-jet fuel is the way to go. They are seriously looking at building plants. Carbon sequestration is huge with them, because they’re all about carbon and getting that score as low as possible. And if they can get the carbon sequestration that makes our ethanol way better to get into that fuel.”

Export Records

In the December domestic supply and demand report, the U.S. Department of Agriculture increased corn exports to a record 3.2 billion bushels, a 125 million bushel increase over the previous month and 342 million above the 2024-2025 estimate.

“We’re at record levels on corn exports. We’re already above last year’s. Mexico’s just been huge. They’re just continuing to increase their production, and that’s going up every year,” Wilson said.

“I know there’s talk about, whether they hate Trump, love Trump, doesn’t matter, there’s 35 countries that we have agreements, frameworks, executive orders, whatever, done with, and in the past, when we did trade agreements, it took two to seven years to get a trade agreement. These have been done in two to five months.

“The only problem is these are executive orders, and anybody can come in as president and change them, Trump himself can change them, but right now we’re seeing a lot of excitement out there. This is more excitement than we’ve had in decades to trade, to getting out there and making deals, making things happen, and we’re seeing that.”

Aviation Fuel

The 106-billion-gallon global and 21-billion-gallon domestic commercial jet fuel market is projected to grow to over 230 billion gallons by 2050.

Cost-competitive, environmentally sustainable aviation fuels are recognized as a critical part of decoupling carbon growth from market growth, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

As an alternative to petroleum jet fuel, SAF can be produced from agricultural and waste feedstocks and blended with petroleum jet fuel.

Watters believes using ethanol in a mix for jet fuel is five to 10 years down the road.

“The technology exists. It’s not just a theoretical thing, but it hasn’t been really commercialized yet,” he said.

“I believe a plant in Georgia has restarted, but that’s more or less a demonstration facility, and I think their max is like 10 million gallons or something like that.

“Most of the SAF that’s available in the market today is derived from oils — so, whether it’s beef tallow or used cooking oil, soybean oil, palm oil, whatever. I suspect that will increase a little bit, that there’s a limit. We do have a limit on how much vegetable oil is available in the world right now.

“That’s why there’s a lot of interest in ethanol to jet fuel. I’m optimistic, but I think that’s probably a five- to 10-year timeline, and that’s maybe a little bit optimistic about it I suppose. I think it’ll come, but I don’t think it’s going to be the panacea that I think some people have maybe made it out to be.”

“I think the price of it is the big thing. It’s about three times the cost of regular air fuel by the time they go through everything. I think that is a hindering point. Without some type of support by governance or something to get that through, it’s going to be a little harder.”

SAF Criteria

“Carbon intensity” is a key part of the SAF picture.

“For it to be considered sustainable aviation fuel right now, at least under the international kind of guidelines, is it has to meet at least a 50% reduction in carbon intensity,” Watters said.

“That’s something that’s really, really important, kind of this foundational issue, is that in order for ethanol-to-jet to become a reality, the process breaking the molecule, rebuilding and all of that adds carbon intensity. So, you’re beginning ethanol feed stock has to be at a low enough carbon intensity that it can be manipulated and built into SAF to reach that 50% target at least.

“So, as farmers, we’re going to be talking about carbon intensity more and more and more. This is going to become a part of the vocabulary. I don’t know how this is all going to play out, if there will be some kind of incentives for practice changes or anything else.

“I can foresee a future where commodities are potentially marketed with certifications of what your carbon intensity is. This is going to be getting more and more complicated, I think, as time goes on.”",https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/b7uX_tNAFauWKUcJU5NT6c016lY=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70):focal(103x799:113x809)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/IOP7AMYNRBH6VBOBB4BHSK7Q74.JPG,N,,2026-01-22 10:37:59.929175

MtJ is positioned to help scale SAF faster and at lower cost with standard approval expected by 2026–27 and nearly 2 Mt of capacity already in development.

BRUSSELS, BELGIUM, January 22, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Methanol-to-Jet (MtJ) could become a major contributor to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), according to a new report Methanol-to-Jet SAF: Policy, Technoeconomic and Commercial Outlook, released today by the Methanol Institute (MI). MI worked with a group of experts across the industry to provide the first of its kind comprehensive overview of MtJ, its potential, needed policy incentives and assessment of opportunities and challenges ahead.

As global jet fuel demand is expected to rise by 50% by 2050, aviation faces a widening gap between climate targets and the availability of affordable low-carbon fuels. SAF is essential to closing that gap and existing pathways alone cannot deliver the volumes required. MI’s new report indicates MtJ will help bridge this gap by combining strong emissions performance with scale and cost advantages. MtJ builds on a global methanol value chain producing more than 100 million tonnes per year, with renewable and low-carbon capacity expanding rapidly.

“The challenge for aviation is no longer proving that SAF works. It’s producing enough of it, fast enough,” said Alexander Döll, CEO of the Methanol Institute. “Methanol-to-Jet offers a realistic pathway to scale because it connects aviation to an existing industrial system that is already global, flexible, and growing. Policy decisions taken in the next few years will determine which SAF pathways reach scale,” Döll added. “Methanol-to-Jet can move forward now, provided that market signals are clear.”

Key findings

• Deep emissions cuts at scale: MtJ produced from renewable methanol can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by 70–90% compared to conventional jet fuel, making it a strong candidate for meeting long-term climate targets.

• Cost advantage over other emerging SAF options: MtJ from renewable sources is among the most cost competitive SAF pathway outperforming Fischer–Tropsch and advanced alcohol-based routes. With supportive policies, integrated MtJ plants could approach cost parity with fossil jet fuel by 2040.

• Commercial use within reach: as early as 2026, MtJ could be used in commercial aircrafts and access policy incentives in major markets. The pathway is advancing through the international standard approval process (ASTM International) required before new fuels can be used in commercial aircraft.

• Projects moving toward investment decisions: As of August 2025, MtJ projects under development represent around 1.8 million tonnes per year of future SAF capacity with over 60 Mt of announced capacity across e-methanol, biomethanol, and low-carbon methanol by 2030. China leads with about half of global projects, followed by Europe and North America.

• Reduced exposure to feedstock constraints: as one of the largest commodities in the world, methanol can be produced through multiple pathways including fossil and renewable resources, with options such as carbon capture and the use of low-carbon or renewable electricity. This make MtJ less vulnerable to the feedstock constraints already affecting some SAF pathways.

• Supportive policy is critical: the report identifies that tax credits, SAF blending mandates and global programs such as CORSIA are essential to give the necessary signals for investor confidence.

• MtJ is complimentary to other SAF with demand for jet fuel projected to rise from ~350 Mt in 2024 to ~500 Mt by 2040–2045.

ERA warns that the EU261 revision risks higher compensation costs for regional airlines, potentially reducing routes to remote areas and impacting everyday mobility

Following today’s plenary vote in the European Parliament on the revision of the EU air passenger rights regulation, EU261, the European Regions Airline Association (ERA) has warned that the decision could put essential regional air services across Europe at risk.

While strengthening passenger rights is a shared goal, ERA says the vote reflects political positioning rather than operational and economic realities. The association warns that regional airlines, which operate smaller aircraft and lower-margin networks, could face disproportionate costs and regulatory burdens.

“Regional airlines risk becoming the punchbags of a political tug-of-war. ERA members operate over 1,000 unique routes, yet when compensation can reach two to three times the ticket price, the outcome is not stronger passenger rights but fewer essential air links for islanders, remote regions, and commuters who rely on these services. This is not about punctuality or compensation. However well-intentioned, decisions in the European Parliament risk turning a passenger-rights file into a barrier to everyday mobility for European citizens by overlooking the impact on regional airlines,” said Montserrat Barriga, Director General of ERA.

Regional airlines provide year-round connectivity to remote areas, often serving routes with no alternative transport options. They link citizens to healthcare, education, and employment and play a vital role in regional development and sustainable aviation. Many operate small fleets, face limited rerouting options, and rely on single bases, making them uniquely exposed to high regulatory costs.

ERA emphasises that the revised EU261 could have punitive effects, undermining connectivity even though regional carriers actively minimise cancellations and maintain essential services where they are the only transport link available.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2194199535-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 10:38:03.444922

Renewable fuels in Canada are approximately a 60-40 split between gas and diesel with consumption varying significantly across the provinces.
The use of renewable fuels within the gasoline pool are currently above the minimum mandated volumes driven by consumption in Ontario, Quebec and B.C.
On the renewable distillate side, British Columbia is currently over 30-per-cent renewable diesel.","During the Scaling Up Bio 2025 Conference this past November, president of Advanced Biofuels Canada Fred Ghatala offered attendees an update on the state of liquid clean fuels in Canada.

Advanced Biofuels Canada promotes the production and use of advanced biofuels in Canada by expanding market access, creating a policy environment that is conducive for investment and collaborating broadly to decarbonize transportation and enhance energy security by increasing renewable content blends and gas, diesel, jet fuel, remove fuels and heating oil. The organization’s 30-plus member companies represent the production of 45 billion litres of global renewable fuel production.

Ghatala shared data from the Biofuels in Canada 2025 report, created by Navius Research, which is in its tenth year of reporting.

“It finally gives us a decade looking at clean fuel production and growth and use, and emission reductions and taxation. Lots and lots of details for us to look at,” Ghatala said.

The report data stated that the renewable fuels market is experiencing continuous growth and that Canada is now a 6-billion litre market.

“Bioethanol has increased about 1.45x even as total use of blended gasoline has gone down over the period. Renewables and diesel have gone up by 10x, and that includes biodiesel and renewable diesel and a bit of co-processed fuel over that same period, even while total blended diesel use declines,” Ghatala told the crowd.

He also presented the blending levels and where the volumes of renewables are occurring in the different types of fuel. In the past year, 10 per cent of renewables were in gasoline; about seven per cent of renewables were in diesel.

“Last year alone, biomass-based diesel consumption went up nine per cent to almost 1.5 billion litres per year. Ethanol increased six per cent to 4.2 billion litres per year,” he said.

Renewable fuels in Canada are approximately a 60-40 split between gas and diesel with consumption varying significantly across the provinces. Ontario is the largest consumer of bioethanol; while British Columbia is the largest consumer of biomass-based diesel at over 1 billion litres.

The use of renewable fuels within the gasoline pool are currently above the minimum mandated volumes driven by consumption in Ontario, Quebec and B.C. Ghatala said that is partially due to Ontario and Quebec moving to 15-per-cent renewables in gasoline by 2030; and British Columbia, which is about 10-per-cent renewables in gasoline, and will soon be selling E15 (15-per-cent American-made ethanol) in the province, as it is in Ontario and Quebec.

On the renewable distillate side, British Columbia is currently over 30-per-cent renewable diesel.

“Thirty is a pretty big number in Canada. If I go to a conference in California and say, ‘We’re at 30 per cent,” they’d say, ‘Oh, that’s really cute, we’re at 80 per cent.’ But it’s a big deal,” Ghatala said.

The larger adoption of renewable diesel in B.C. is entirely policy driven, he explained. The province has also put Canada’s first low-carbon jet fuel obligation into place.

“In 2024 alone, there was nearly one-per-cent SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) being used in the YVR jet fuel supply chain. We expect that’s continued in 2025 and will continue as the policy takes more effect. British Columbia’s approach to jet [fuel] is a volumetric requirement that starts at one per cent in 2028 and grows to three and 2030; and there’s a carbon intensity reduction of 10 per cent that starts in 2026. So, a lot of that is pre-mandate, pre-CI reduction requirement,” Ghatala explained.

The current status of the Canadian clean fuel supply chain for liquid renewable fuels is over 2 billion litres of bioethanol production, which equates to roughly five per cent of Canada’s gasoline pool. The country also has capacity of approximately 2.5 billion litres of renewable diesel production; 500 million litres of biodiesel capacity; and a small amount of co-processing; which Ghatala said is likely growing as additional refineries continue to co-process.

The current capacity-to-use ratio is about 50 per cent for ethanol produced in Canada, meaning the industry produces about half of the country’s demand. However, when biodiesel and renewable diesel production are included, the country is oversupply for the current level of its policies, Ghatala noted.

“So, there’s a significant opportunity for provinces. Especially provinces that have renewable diesel production in them, or have recent canola crush capacity in them, to look at expanding the minimum volume requirements to ensure that there’s a market for those fuels that isn’t at risk by foreign trade, distortion and turbulence,” he said.",https://www.canadianbiomassmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Fred-Ghatala-1-572x1024.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 07:37:35.291152

The Department for Transport said the funds will be allocated to the research and development of emerging technologies that will play “an important role in delivering on the government’s vision to expand airports in line with climate targets”.

“Zero emission aircraft, hydrogen fuels and other emerging technologies are vital to reduce the climate impacts from flying and will enable us to deliver our airport expansion plans to boost connectivity and grow the economy,” said transport secretary Heidi Alexander.

From February, businesses, researchers and universities across the UK will have the opportunity to bid for a share of the funds. Meanwhile, the Civil Aviation Authority will also use this investment to develop regulations for the widespread adoption of hydrogen fuel.

The government expects the public funds will “drive millions of pounds of private investment” into technology development and scientific research to help decarbonise the aviation sector.

The funding announcement comes after the government last July allocated £63 million in grants to accelerate the production of alternative aviation fuels, also known as 'sustainable aviation fuel' (SAF), following the introduction of the UK’s SAF mandate.

This is not a pure technology play, but a practical extension of private aviation.
At the recent Dubai Airshow, Jetex supplied sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and sold out its entire allocated volume.
Operationally, the Saudi facilities will mirror Jetex’s Dubai flagship, with lounges, concierge services, crew rest areas, and on-site customs clearance.
“If you land in the Red Sea or Riyadh, it must feel like Jetex Dubai.” Elsewhere, Jetex is expanding across Asia, Africa, and Latin America.","For nearly two decades, Adel Mardini has done what few founders in private aviation have managed. He has built Jetex by reshaping the private aviation market, using Dubai’s geographic reach and regulatory openness to scale a premium service across regions.

Under his leadership, Jetex has grown from a single location into a network spanning 38 locations globally, set to reach 75 by the end of next year, prized for its sleek environments, meticulous service standards, and brand consistency.

That phase of Jetex’s evolution is largely complete. Today, Mardini’s focus has shifted. The emphasis is no longer on how Jetex looks, or even how large it becomes, but on how efficiently the entire system works and where time is still being lost.

“People don’t fly private just to be in the air,” Mardini says, speaking at Jetex’s flagship VIP terminal at Dubai’s Al Maktoum International Airport. “They do it to save time. If you land and then lose another hour or two on the ground, the experience breaks.”

That observation has become a key principle behind Jetex’s next chapter. After years spent building scale, brand credibility, and global reach, the company is repositioning itself as a connective platform, designed to remove friction from every stage of private travel, from arrival and transfer to fuel, infrastructure, and what comes next.

Solving the last mile

The most visible expression of that shift is Jetex’s growing focus on the so-called “last mile”, the point at which private aviation’s promise of time-saving often begins to unravel.

For many clients, the contradiction is familiar. A private jet shaves hours off a journey, immigration takes minutes — but then a ground transfer consumes another one or two hours in traffic. For travellers paying a premium to compress time, the inefficiency is hard to ignore.

It is this gap that has pushed Jetex to focus increasingly on the eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) sector. Through partnerships with Archer and Joby Aviation, Jetex is positioning itself as an infrastructure and services partner for air taxi operations. This is not a pure technology play, but a practical extension of private aviation.

“The vertiport industry is expected to grow into a market worth more than $200bn over the next 10 to 15 years,” Mardini says. “For us, eVTOL is not a novelty. It’s about solving the biggest inefficiency in private travel.”

Jetex’s ambition is to integrate eVTOL aircraft directly into its terminal operations, allowing passengers to transition from jet to air taxi with minimal friction.

“Connecting the traditional jet with eVTOL aircraft will be a major milestone for us,” Mardini says. “And it’s one we will achieve.”

Jetex has already signed agreements with Archer and Joby to support their growth in the UAE, with plans to extend this capability across its global network. Dubai is expected to be among the earliest deployment sites.

“Our clients want to complete their journey,” Mardini adds. “They want to land, finish their procedures, and move on immediately. That’s what we’re building.”

This emphasis on continuity also explains Jetex’s move beyond the airport itself. In 2026, the company plans to operate its first lifestyle premises, incorporating a café, a hotel, and a private members’ club.

Rather than viewing the airport as the endpoint, Jetex increasingly sees it as one node in a broader ecosystem that serves the same clientele beyond aviation alone.

“Our clients already trust us with their time, their privacy, and their travel,” Mardini says. “That trust allows us to extend the experience into other parts of their lives.”

Global footprint to connected flow

This focus on efficiency helps explain why Jetex’s next phase of expansion looks different from its last.

With the network set to reach 75 locations, spanning the Middle East, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America, the numbers suggest continued rapid growth.

“This footprint gives us something very powerful,” Mardini says. “It allows us to deliver the same service, the same experience, everywhere. That consistency is what enables us to connect the entire journey.”

Before Covid-19, Jetex’s typical private aviation client was an ultra-high-net-worth individual from traditional sectors such as oil and gas, or a government official, often aged between 50 and 80. Private aviation was largely about access and discretion.

Since the pandemic, that profile has shifted markedly.

Today, the average Jetex passenger is between 25 and 55, with growing representation from technology, crypto, fashion, entertainment, and creative industries. Many migrated from first and business class on commercial airlines during Covid-19 and never returned, drawn by speed, privacy, and control.

“These clients are extremely time-sensitive,” Mardini says. “They are globally mobile, digitally fluent, and they expect the experience on the ground to work as seamlessly as it does in the air.”

Scaling with sustainability

Efficiency is not only about movement. It is also about fuel, infrastructure, and systems working together.

At the recent Dubai Airshow, Jetex supplied sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and sold out its entire allocated volume. Demand was strong enough that additional supply was requested but unavailable.

“We were very happy to bring SAF fuel to the Dubai Airshow,” Mardini says. “The fact that it sold out tells you demand is increasing.”

Jetex has been the exclusive ground handler for the Dubai Airshow since 2016, and this marked the second time it introduced SAF at the event. While cost, availability, and certification challenges remain, Mardini believes client pressure is accelerating adoption.

“Many of our corporate clients have their own net-zero commitments,” he says. “They expect us to provide fuel options that help them meet those goals.”

Geographically, Saudi Arabia represents one of Jetex’s most strategically important growth markets. The company has been appointed exclusive fixed-base operator at Red Sea International Airport, the gateway to one of the kingdom’s most ambitious luxury tourism developments.

“That means we’ll be there from the very first flight,” Mardini says. “We’ll be shaping the experience for every VIP and private passenger who arrives.”

Beyond the Red Sea, Jetex is actively evaluating opportunities in Riyadh, Jeddah, and NEOM. Operationally, the Saudi facilities will mirror Jetex’s Dubai flagship, with lounges, concierge services, crew rest areas, and on-site customs clearance.

“Our model is to replicate the same feel everywhere,” Mardini says. “If you land in the Red Sea or Riyadh, it must feel like Jetex Dubai.”

Elsewhere, Jetex is expanding across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Markets such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam remain at an early stage of private aviation development. Southeast Asia’s business jet market is forecast to grow at a compound annual rate of 15.5 per cent between 2025 and 2030, according to Mordor Intelligence.

“These markets are fragmented,” Mardini says. “But that fragmentation creates opportunity for a global brand with standards.”

Behind Jetex’s polished lounges sits a centralised operating engine. From Dubai, a 24/7 global operations team coordinates flight planning, permits, fuel, catering, and ground handling across the network.

“From the moment a client calls, our system kicks in,” Mardini says. “We can arrange services anywhere in the world within hours.”

This is supported by proprietary technology that tracks flights, crew schedules, and fuel supply in real time.

“Technology doesn’t replace our people,” Mardini says. “It makes them faster and more accurate.”

Connecting what comes next

As Jetex accelerates its expansion, the challenge is no longer simply growth, but integration, ensuring complexity disappears entirely from the client’s point of view.

“If we can grow and still have our customers feel like we are their personal aviation team, then we’ve succeeded,” Mardini says.

The footprint is expanding. The infrastructure is evolving. The experience is being re-engineered.

Jetex’s next frontier is efficiency — and the ability to turn time itself into its most valuable offering.",https://gulfbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Jetex-320_for-touch-up.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 11:37:18.383941

The offtake deal has been signed between Trafigura and Syzygy’s subsidiary, SP Developments Uruguay S.A. It also gives Trafigura the option to purchase additional SAF volumes from Syzygy’s future projects, creating scope to supply larger quantities of compliant fuel as global regulations tighten.

The agreement comes as airlines face growing mandates to use SAF, while the availability of sustainable feedstocks remains limited. Industry studies have highlighted feedstock shortages as a major challenge to meeting long-term SAF targets. Syzygy’s approach seeks to address this issue by using widely available biogas combined with renewable electricity through a modular, electrified process. At scale, the company expects this pathway to be cost-competitive with, and potentially cheaper than, other SAF routes that rely on constrained resources such as used cooking oil.

Syzygy’s SAF pathway, branded NovaSAF™, has received pre-certification under the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) system to produce Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin and advanced bio-based SAF. This positions the technology as an additional option for regions such as Europe and the United Kingdom to meet 2030 emissions reduction targets.

Syzygy Plasmonics Chief Executive Officer Trevor Best said the agreement represents a major milestone in moving the company’s technology from development to large-scale deployment. He said securing a long-term buyer like Trafigura, along with the completion of front-end engineering design work in December, has cleared the way for the company to raise financing and begin construction of its first commercial plant.

The NovaSAF-1 project will be built in Durazno, Uruguay, and is expected to be the world’s first electrified facility converting biogas into SAF that meets RFNBO standards. The plant will use biogas sourced from the Estancias Del Lago powdered milk facility and renewable electricity generated in Uruguay to produce synthetic aviation fuel. Syzygy estimates the fuel will have lifecycle emissions about 90% lower than conventional jet fuel, while also offering strong economic returns.

Trafigura’s Head of Low Carbon Fuels Business Development, Jason Breslaw, said the agreement supports the company’s efforts to broaden SAF supply as regulations increasingly require the use of advanced fuels. He said Trafigura’s global low-carbon fuels network would help aviation customers meet regulatory needs efficiently, while backing a technology that offers both compliance and competitive costs.

With the NovaSAF-1 project serving as a commercial model, Syzygy plans to replicate the approach in other markets. The company has completed detailed engineering for the project and is now focused on raising capital to begin construction of the Uruguay plant, which it sees as a foundation for global expansion of its biogas-to-SAF technology.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SAF-fuel.jpeg,N,,2026-01-22 10:38:10.565740

The rationale behind this proposal is to support California’s ambitious climate and air-quality goals by incentivising private investment and scaling up clean transportation fuel technologies.

By reducing the tax burden for SAF producers, the state aims to make sustainable aviation fuels more competitive with conventional petroleum-based jet fuels, helping to accelerate market adoption and stimulate innovation in a sector that currently accounts for a large portion of transport-related emissions.

In a call to suppliers that closed earlier this month, European and international companies placed offers from over 260 projects, the Commission's Directorate-General for Energy said in an online statement. Buyers now have until March 20, 2026 to indicate interest in the offers, according to the statement.

""As part of the EU Energy and Raw Materials Platform, the Hydrogen Mechanism connects potential off-takers in Europe with suppliers of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen or derivatives, including ammonia, methanol, eMethane and electro-sustainable aviation fuel"", the Directorate-General said.

""Hydrogen plays an important role in decarbonizing industrial processes and industries for which reducing carbon emissions is both urgent and hard to achieve"", it added. ""At the same time, it can strengthen the competitiveness of Europe’s industry and leverage the EU market towards more security of supply, diversification and decarbonization"".

European Energy and Housing Commissioner Dan Jørgensen said, ""The EU's Hydrogen Mechanism is a new, innovative tool to help develop the market. With strong interest shown from suppliers across Europe and beyond, the initiative is off to a very promising start"".

The broader European Union Energy and Raw Materials Platform lets buyers in the 27-member bloc offer demand for biomethane, hydrogen, natural gas and raw materials. The online platform seeks to give EU companies cost-effective and efficient access to such commodities by enabling negotiations with competing suppliers, according to the Commission.

The Hydrogen Mechanism will operate until 2029 under the European Hydrogen Bank, as specified under the EU's ""Regulation on the Internal Markets for Renewable Gas, Natural Gas and Hydrogen”. The Hydrogen Bank is an EU Innovation Fund financing platform to scale up the renewable hydrogen value chain.

The platform's user guide says, ""The EU Energy and Raw Materials Platform enables the collection and exchange of market data, information about demand and supply, demand aggregation and joint purchasing of energy-related products and raw materials"".

""It does not directly provide financing or support negotiations which may take place, outside of the platform, between participants following their connections through the platform"", the platform says.

The Gas Mechanism is expected to replace AggregateEU, a mechanism in which gas suppliers compete to book demand placed by companies in the EU and its Energy Community partner countries. AggregateEU has been extended, having initially been meant only for the 2023-24 winter.

In March 2025 the Directorate-General said a second midterm round for AggregateEU matched nearly 20 billion cubic meters (706.29 billion cubic feet). Midterm rounds offered six-month contracts for potential suppliers during a buyer-seller partnership of up to five years.

Announcing the first midterm tender February 1, 2024, the Directorate-General said, ""In early 2024, with the effects of the energy crisis still not over, AggregateEU is introducing a different concept of mid-term tenders in order to address the growing demand for stability and predictability from buyers and sellers of natural gas"".

""Under such tenders, buyers will be able to submit their demand for seasonal six-month periods (for a minimum 1,800,000 MWh for LNG and 30,000 for NBP per period), going from April 2024 to October 2029"", the Directorate-General said then. ""This is intended to support sellers in identifying buyers who might be interested in a longer trading partnership - i.e. up to five years"".

NBP gas, or National Balancing Point gas, refers to gas from the national transmission systems of EU states.

Pilcher, Elijah Decious, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.thegazette.com/agriculture/farm-fuel-leaders-push-for-solutions-to-close-iowas-corn-demand-gap/,"Agriculture economists said year-round production of E15 — a gasoline blend that is 15 percent ethanol — would help boost demand for Iowa corn.
Advocates said moving to a fuel blend with a higher concentration of ethanol would close Iowa’s demand gap by 2031.
However, Dave Miller, senior economist with Decision Innovation Solutions, said this wouldn’t be a permanent solution to the state’s corn demand issues.
A need for permanent solutions Mark Mueller, president of the Iowa Corn Growers Association, farms corn and soybeans in near Waverly.
The study pointed to the ultra-low carbon ethanol market, which involves lowering the carbon intensity of ethanol through carbon capture sequestration.","A new report points to the growing gap between the amount of corn Iowa grows and demand for the crop, and suggests new pathways that could keep demand — and prices — up.

The study, prepared for the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association and Iowa Corn Growers Association by Urbandale-based economic research and analysis firm Decision Innovation Solutions, reports that Iowa corn producers continue to lead the U.S. in corn production.

However, if demand isn’t buoyed through increased ethanol use or through the ultra-low carbon ethanol market, the study warns that a $2.50 drop per bushel of corn could “erase $6.9 billion in gross income from corn farmers in Iowa using 2025 production.” At this rate, the report states, by 2050, farmers could lose $9 billion in gross income per year.

Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said Iowa farmers and the state’s agriculture market are currently in a crisis that mirrors the farm crisis of the 1980s.

“I'd say it's a ‘small c’ crisis, but I think if we don't do anything in the next couple of years, or sooner, it's going to be a ‘capital c’ crisis,” he said.

Agriculture economists said year-round production of E15 — a gasoline blend that is 15 percent ethanol — would help boost demand for Iowa corn.

More than half the corn produced in Iowa — and about 40 percent nationwide — is used to produce ethanol. Currently, the dominant form of vehicle gasoline in Iowa is E10, made up of 10 percent ethanol.

Advocates said moving to a fuel blend with a higher concentration of ethanol would close Iowa’s demand gap by 2031.

However, Dave Miller, senior economist with Decision Innovation Solutions, said this wouldn’t be a permanent solution to the state’s corn demand issues.

“E15 is not a sufficient long-term solution,” Miller said. “It is a near-term solution that is very powerful.”

Miller said corn makes up about 29 percent of Iowa’s overall agriculture cash receipts, making it the biggest driver of the state’s agriculture economy, while 24 percent is from hogs, 18 percent is from soybeans, and 17 percent is from cattle. About 12 percent of the state’s total ag cash receipts of $37.6 billion comes from “other” production.

A need for permanent solutions

Mark Mueller, president of the Iowa Corn Growers Association, farms corn and soybeans in near Waverly. He said he’s concerned about Iowa’s current corn market.

“I am a fourth-generation farmer, and I am nervous that there won't be a fifth generation Mueller farming on my family land,” he said in virtual press conference Wednesday that shared Decision Innovation Solutions’ findings. “We need more places to move our corn, and while Iowa Corn is working toward that, it's just a tough, tough road for the farming community.”

To find a more permanent solution and create better balance between supply and demand of Iowa corn, the economic research company identified new pathways that could absorb Iowa farmers’ surplus corn and make demand sustainable.

The study pointed to the ultra-low carbon ethanol market, which involves lowering the carbon intensity of ethanol through carbon capture sequestration.

Shaw said work like that already is underway in Nebraska, which is home to the Tallgrass Trailblazer CO2 pipeline. The pipeline started moving emissions from nearly a dozen Nebraska ethanol plants and one in Iowa in November 2025.

A similar pipeline has been proposed by Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions. The 2,500-mile pipeline would pass through five states, including Iowa, to capture CO2 from ethanol plants and bury it in North Dakota.

The Iowa study also pointed to new industrial markets as another path forward for corn growers. Miller said big markets, like marine fuels, are pivoting from fossil fuels and looking toward ethanol and methanol fuels.

Miller likened it to the sustainable aviation fuel market, which he said is a 35 billion gallon a year market.

“Our projections would suggest that ethanol could take maybe about 20 percent of that market. It's a solution for the future in Iowa,” Miller said. “The biggest demand changer we've had in Iowa in the last 20 years has been ethanol. The growth of the ethanol industry has really transformed Iowa.”

Shaw said Iowa’s agriculture market is at a tipping point as producers are “desperately” in need of new pathways for demand.

“If not, I think we have some very bleak days ahead of us,” Shaw said. “We don't want the current farm income price crisis to go from a ‘small c’ to a ‘capital c.’”

The size of the Europe business jet market was worth USD 5.82 billion in 2025. The regional market is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 2.52% from 2026 to 2034 and be worth USD 7.28 billion by 2034 from USD 5.97 billion in 2026.

Business jets are private turbine powered aircrafts configured for executive transport across the civilian and corporate sectors. These aircraft serve as critical mobility tools for multinational enterprises, high-net-worth individuals, and specialized missions such as medical evacuation or government transport. Unlike commercial aviation, business aviation in Europe operates primarily through a fragmented network of hundreds of general aviation airports, many of which lack customs or night curfew restrictions, enabling point-to-point efficiency unattainable via scheduled carriers. According to Eurocontrol, business jet flights numbered in the hundreds of thousands in European airspace in 2024, reflecting sustained reliance on private aviation for time-sensitive missions. As per the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, a significant share of Europe’s business jet fleet is registered in offshore jurisdictions such as the Isle of Man, Malta, and Aruba due to favorable tax and regulatory frameworks. Furthermore, the European Commission’s Single European Sky ATM Research program notes that business aviation accounts for approximately 8% of total civil air traffic movements, yet contributes disproportionately to airspace flexibility and regional connectivity, particularly in remote or underserved areas where scheduled service is economically unviable.

MARKET DRIVERS

Rising Demand for Time-Efficient Executive Mobility in Multinational Corporate Operations

European businesses increasingly rely on business jets to maintain operational agility across fragmented regulatory and geographic landscapes, which is one of the key factors driving the growth of the European business jet market. As per the European Business Aviation Association, a majority of Fortune 500 companies with European headquarters utilize private aviation to coordinate cross-border management visits, factory audits, and client engagements. The average commercial flight itinerary between secondary European cities, such as Stuttgart to Toulouse or Gothenburg to Valencia, often involves at least one connection and a total travel time exceeding several hours. In contrast, a light jet completes the same route in under two hours door to door. Studies on executive productivity confirm that business jet users save significant time compared to commercial alternatives, which translates into thousands of additional productive hours annually for large corporate subsidiaries. This time advantage is especially critical in sectors like pharmaceuticals, automotive, and finance, where rapid decision-making and site visits directly impact revenue. As supply chains decentralize and talent pools scatter across rural innovation hubs, the need for flexible point-to-point access intensifies, making business jets not a luxury but a strategic operational asset.

Growth of Ultra High Net Worth Population Driving Fractional and Full Ownership

Europe’s expanding cohort of ultra-high-net-worth individuals is fuelling sustained demand for private aviation through direct ownership and fractional programs, which is another major factor contributing to the growth of the European business jet market. According to the Global Wealth Report published by Credit Suisse, the number of individuals in Europe with investable assets exceeding 30 million US dollars grew in 2024. These individuals prioritize privacy, security, and schedule control, as these are the attributes inherently delivered by business jets. Unlike commercial first class, private aviation eliminates exposure to crowded terminals, security lines, and fixed departure times. Surveys by UBS Wealth Management found that many European UHNWIs view private jet access as essential for personal and family mobility, particularly for leisure travel to destinations such as Sardinia, the Alps, or the Greek islands, where commercial service is seasonal or non-existent. Additionally, the rise of family office structures has institutionalized aviation as a managed asset with dedicated flight departments overseeing safety, maintenance, and compliance. This demographic tailwind ensures baseline demand even during economic slowdowns, as wealth preservation and lifestyle continuity remain non-negotiable.

MARKET RESTRAINTS

Stringent Environmental Regulations and Carbon Pricing Increase Operational Costs

The Europe business jet market faces mounting pressure from climate policies that directly elevate flight expenses and constrain operations. According to the European Commission, all business jet operators flying within the EU must participate in the EU Emissions Trading System, which in 2024 priced carbon allowances at over 85 euros per ton. For a typical light jet emitting nearly two tons of CO₂ per hour, this adds significant compliance costs to every flight hour. Furthermore, the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate requires that 2% of all aviation fuel supplied at EU airports be sustainable aviation fuel by 2025, rising to 70% by 2050. As per the European Environment Agency, sustainable aviation fuel currently costs several times more than conventional Jet A1, making compliance financially burdensome for small operators. Several countries have introduced additional levies; France imposes a departure tax on private jets, while the Netherlands plans a progressive noise and emissions surcharge by 2026. These cumulative costs disproportionately impact light and mid-size jet operators who lack the economies of scale to absorb them, potentially forcing fleet reductions or market exits.

Public and Political Backlash Against the Perceived Inequity of Private Aviation

Business aviation in Europe increasingly contends with social stigma and policy hostility rooted in perceptions of excess amid economic and climate crises, which is further hindering the growth of the European business jet market. According to a 2024 Eurobarometer survey, a majority of EU citizens believe private jets should be banned or heavily taxed due to their disproportionate carbon footprint relative to passenger capacity. This sentiment has translated into concrete political action; the European Parliament’s Transport Committee proposed a continent-wide ban on short-haul business jet flights where rail alternatives under six hours exist, which is a measure that would affect a large share of current operations between major European cities. Local governments have also restricted access; London City Airport prohibits private jet arrivals during peak hours, while Geneva and Nice impose steep night landing fees. Media scrutiny intensifies the pressure as investigations have linked offshore aircraft registrations to tax avoidance schemes, prompting calls for transparency reforms. This reputational and regulatory headwind complicates fleet planning, market expansion, and brand positioning for operators and manufacturers alike.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

Adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Electrification Pathways Creates Green Premium Segment

The emergence of low-carbon propulsion technologies is opening a new value tier for environmentally conscious operators, which is a prominent opportunity in the European business jet market. According to the European Business Aviation Association, dozens of business jet operators in Europe now offer carbon-neutral flight options through sustainable aviation fuel blending or verified offset programs. Leading manufacturers such as Dassault and Gulfstream have certified their latest models for 100% sustainable aviation fuel use, which is enabling immediate emissions reduction without airframe modification. In 2024, the European Commission approved significant funding under the Innovation Fund to support sustainable aviation fuel production plants in Spain and the Netherlands, with output prioritized for business aviation due to its early adopter profile. As per a survey by VistaJet, a majority of corporate clients are willing to pay a premium for flights powered by certified sustainable fuel. This green premium segment not only mitigates reputational risk but also aligns with corporate net-zero commitments under the EU Taxonomy, creating a strategic differentiation avenue in an otherwise mature market.

Expansion of On-Demand Jet Card and Subscription Models Lowers Entry Barriers

The proliferation of flexible access models is democratizing business aviation beyond traditional ownership circles, which is offering prominent opportunities in the European business jet market. According to the European Business Aviation Association, fractional and jet card programs now account for a growing share of private flight hours in Europe compared to earlier years. Companies such as LunaJets and Victor offer subscription plans starting at accessible annual fees, granting guaranteed availability without capital outlay or management overhead. These models appeal to mid-sized enterprises and affluent professionals who fly 25 to 50 hours per year, which is below the threshold for cost-effective ownership. According to a PwC analysis, jet card users achieve lower total cost per flight hour compared to ad hoc charter due to volume pricing and fixed hourly rates. Additionally, digital platforms provide real-time pricing, fleet availability, and carbon footprint tracking, enhancing transparency and ease of use. As digital payment infrastructure and dynamic pricing algorithms mature, this on-demand ecosystem is transforming business aviation from an asset-intensive luxury into a scalable mobility service accessible to a broader economic stratum.

MARKET CHALLENGES

Fragmented Air Traffic Management and Airport Access Restrictions Limit Operational Flexibility

Despite the Single European Sky initiative, business jet operators continue to face inefficiencies due to national airspace fragmentation and localized airport constraints, which are major challenges to the growth of the European business jet market. According to Eurocontrol, average en route flight times for business jets in Europe remain longer than optimal due to uncoordinated air traffic flows and restricted military zones. Furthermore, hundreds of general aviation airports across the EU impose noise quotas, night curfews, or slot limitations that restrict access during critical business hours. According to a study by the European Business Aviation Association, many operators experienced denied airport access in the past year due to ad hoc restrictions in countries such as Germany, France, and Switzerland. These bottlenecks undermine the core value proposition of private aviation and force rerouting that increases fuel burn and carbon output. Until the EU fully implements centralized flow management and harmonizes noise certification standards across member states, business jets will operate in a patchwork regulatory environment that erodes efficiency and reliability.

Supply Chain Constraints for Advanced Avionics and Engine Components Delay Fleet Renewal

The Europe business jet market contends with persistent delivery bottlenecks driven by global shortages of high-specification aerospace components. According to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, lead times for next-generation flight deck systems have extended significantly due to semiconductor allocation priorities favoring commercial airliners. Similarly, engine manufacturers report backlogs exceeding two years for popular light and mid-size jet engines. As per a 2024 audit by Roland Berger, European operators planning fleet upgrades faced delays in aircraft delivery compared to pre-pandemic norms. This supply constraint forces businesses to retain older, less efficient aircraft longer, increasing maintenance costs and carbon intensity. Without dedicated allocation channels or regionalized component manufacturing, the market will remain vulnerable to aerospace industry-wide capacity limits that suppress modernization and sustainability goals.

–Sydney Garrett, Iowa Corn Growers Association","JOHNSTON, Iowa — Without immediate passage of nationwide, year-round E15 and access to ultra-low carbon ethanol markets, such as sustainable aviation fuel and marine fuel, Iowa’s corn and ethanol industry will continue its downward decline, according to a new study released by Iowa Corn and the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association.

The study’s release comes at a time when farmers are faced with a 2 billion bushel plus carryout and rising input costs for farm operations such as fertilizer, seed, machinery, etc. The study shows that corn prices are estimated at $1.52 per bushel. Without access expanded and new markets, many farmers may be forced to downsize or close their doors all together.

To ensure long-term profitability, we must deploy the technology to unlock the potential of ultra-low carbon ethanol—specifically through carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) pipelines. This infrastructure is the ‘missing link’ that allows us to capture emissions at the source, drastically lowering the carbon intensity of our fuel and providing the verifiable data required to participate in high-value global markets. Four of the top five export markets for U.S. ethanol—the EU, the UK, Canada, and Colombia— already have low-carbon fuel policies to help them meet their decarbonization goals.

Without the immediate adoption of nationwide E15 to stabilize domestic demand, and the critical infrastructure of a CCS pipeline to unlock global low-carbon markets, Iowa’s economic engine will stall. When our farms struggle, our energy independence weakens, fuel prices rise for every family, and we hand the lead in the global green energy race to our competitors. We have the resources, technology and soil to power the world with ethanol. To let this opportunity slip away is a risk our Iowa cannot afford.

“Without new corn demand, Iowa could be faced with a 1980s farm crisis,” said Mueller.

It’s time to authorize nationwide E15 and secure Iowa’s position as the global leader in corn and ethanol production.

Are these widely heard claims actually true, or are they myths that need busting?

1: Travelers Won’t Pay a Sustainability Premium. Full Stop.

While Skift research found sustainability ranks dead last in traveler priorities behind comfort and location, the real problem isn’t willingness to pay, it’s visibility and trust.

Some 42% of U.S. travelers now express interest in greener options, up from 32% in recent years.

China and India show even stronger signals that travelers would be willing to look at greener options if they were given the choice.

But there is growing research that shows that information around sustainability is either not offered or unclear: 30% of U.S. travelers report encountering zero sustainable messaging when booking.

Take any typical search for a hotel at an online travel agent or search platform. Hundreds of results, but how can you really tell the difference between hotels’ green credentials? Which ones are using renewable energy over fossil fuels?

The industry hasn’t made it easy to choose greener options, even for those who want to.

2: Carbon Offsets Are Reducing Emissions

A review found that only 16% of carbon credits available today deliver real emissions reductions.

The offset market has been plagued by non-additional credits, projects like “protecting” forests that were never really under threat, or claiming credit for coal plants that were already scheduled to close. The kind where consumers are offered a tick box to pay a couple of dollars to make their trip green.

Travel companies, especially airlines, are backing away from offering passengers the offset tickbox, and in Skift polling, travelers ranked offsets at the bottom of sustainable choices they’d consider making, signalling they don’t trust where the money is going.

However, in recent months, reports show that while demand in the bulk of the offset market has fallen flat, there is growing demand for higher quality credits.

For example, the restoration of native forests or what’s known as additional carbon credits, removing CO2 from the atmosphere through carbon capture.

3: SAF Will Scale Beyond Virtue Signaling

Aviation needs approximately 450 million tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel, plant based oils, annually to reach net zero by 2050, accounting for sector growth.

In 2025, the industry used just 1.9 million tonnes, 0.6% of total fuel consumption. Rather than ramping up, SAF production moved backward in 2025.

Shell cancelled its $1 billion Rotterdam project that would have produced 820,000 tonnes annually. U.S. capacity projections collapsed 61%, from 4.8 million tonnes to 1.9 million tonnes, as investors turned away.

Most SAF today comes from used cooking oil, and supply is very limited.

Travel accounts for an estimated 9% of global greenhouse gas emissions annually. While other sectors emit more in absolute terms, travel’s trajectory is growing twice as fast as other industries.

In the UK, where sectors like agriculture, road transport, and buildings are reducing emissions, aviation is projected to account for 25% of all national emissions by 2035.

As other sectors decarbonize and travel demand rises, particularly with growing middle classes worldwide, the industry faces increasing scrutiny in the future.

5: Green Hotels Are More Expensive to Build

There are a number of studies and reports that have analysed the cost of constructing a so-called green building.

Think solar panels, heat pumps, recycled bricks and steal, circular economy furniture, lamps, electric kitchens and laundries.

It’s been found that green buildings cost approximately 2% more to construct upfront. However, when lifecycle costs are considered, buildings can deliver 14-19% in operational savings.

For example, IHG’s Voco Zeal Hotel on England’s south coast runs on 100% renewable energy with solar panels built into walls.

There is another very similar Zeal Hotel nearby and with the same number of rooms, providing an opportunity for valuable data and comparisons. The annual energy cost there is about £300,000.

The solar one is £100,000, a huge cost saving and zero emissions.

Corporate lodging payment service HRS found that hotels with the lowest emissions, water use, and waste per room night are cutting costs faster than those with the highest environmental impact.

6: Sustainable Stays Mean Higher Rack Rates for Guests

Pricing algorithms, location, timing, and facilities have far more impact on room rates than sustainability features. The pricing at hotels that claim to be net-zero or low carbon pricing largely matches competitors in the same area.

At Radisson’s net-zero hotel in Manchester city center, rates for a two-night stay align with similar hotels in the area.

The company confirmed no special incentives or premium pricing for the property. This pattern holds across other markets where low-carbon hotels using renewable energy price competitively with others.

7: 2050 Net-Zero Pledges Are Just Expensive PR

Net-zero commitments aren’t optional PR, they’re increasingly legal requirements.

Travel is a global industry, and net-zero by 2050 is law in many countries where companies operate. In the EU, all new buildings must be zero-emission from 2030, and existing buildings must achieve a 16% reduction in energy use, with 75% of current buildings considered inefficient.

Similar laws exist in Australia, the UK and China. Even U.S. companies operating in Europe and other markets must comply.

Minister for Transport Darragh O'Brien visited the Trinity College Dublin Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Research Facility at SMBC Aviation Capital's headquarters in Dublin earlier this week. The visit underscores Ireland's commitment to advancing sustainable aviation and accelerating the decarbonisation of the global aviation sector.

The research facility, located at SMBC Aviation Capital's Fitzwilliam 28 offices, represents a unique collaboration between the aircraft leasing industry and academia to address one of aviation's most pressing challenges. As the sector works toward net-zero emissions by 2050, Sustainable Aviation Fuel is emerging as the most viable near-term decarbonisation solution available.

SAF is a ""drop-in"" alternative to conventional jet fuel that can be used in existing aircraft and engines, resulting in lifecycle CO₂ emissions reductions of up to 70-80%. While challenges around affordability and availability remain, SAF represents the current best option for reducing aviation's carbon footprint in the short to medium term.

The visit comes following the recent publication of Ireland's Sustainable Aviation Fuel Policy Roadmap by the Department of Transport, which was assisted by the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Task Force, including aviation lessors and other key stakeholders. The Roadmap identifies key opportunities and pathways for advancing SAF deployment in Ireland.

The Trinity College Dublin SAF Research Facility supports the EU SAF Clearing House, sponsored by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), providing pre-screening and advisory services to early-stage fuel producers. This work bridges critical scientific, regulatory, and commercial gaps that currently inhibit SAF scale-up. The facility, is also supported by Aircraft Leasing Ireland, Ryanair and Research Ireland.

Professor Stephen Dooley explains the work of the team at the Trinity College Dublin SAF Research Facility at SMBC Aviation Capital Headquarters,

Minister for Transport, Darragh O’Brien, said: “This marks an important opportunity to acknowledge the ongoing collaboration between SMBC Aviation Capital and Trinity College Dublin, with wider support from Aircraft Leasing Ireland, Ryanair and Research Ireland, to progress the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

“This collaborative approach exemplifies the commitment of the sector to decarbonising aviation, and acknowledges the crucial role that SAF will play in achieving this. I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the significant level of engagement my Department received from all stakeholders in the development of Ireland’s first Sustainable Aviation Fuel Policy Roadmap, which I published last summer.

“I am delighted to have the opportunity to see first-hand the Trinity College Dublin SAF Research Facility. With implementation of our Sustainable Aviation Fuel Policy Roadmap, the expertise of our academia, lessors, airlines and other key stakeholders, I am confident Ireland will continue to be at the forefront of delivering innovation for the sector.”

Peter Barrett, CEO, SMBC Aviation Capital, said: “It was a privilege to welcome Minister for Transport, Darragh O’Brien to the Trinity College Dublin SAF Research facility located at our Dublin headquarters. The development and adoption of sustainable aviation fuel is a critical decarbonisation lever for the industry, and meaningful progress depends on strong collaboration between policymakers, academia and the private sector. We are proud to contribute to this effort and this visit reflects the shared commitment to building a more sustainable aviation future.”

Minister Darragh O'Brien, Professor Stephen Dooley and collaborators from Trinity and SMBC Aviation Capital meet at the facility in SMBC Capital Aviation Headquarters.

Professor Stephen Dooley, Director of the Trinity College SAF Research Facility, said: “Sustainable Aviation Fuels are the essential method to decarbonise aviation. SAFs are being made from a wide range of non-fossil feedstocks by technological innovations from all over the world. Due to the safety requirements of aviation, all aviation fuels including SAFs are subject to rigorous data intensive technical evaluation.

""Currently this evaluation is performed on a case by case basis, and this is the work that the SAF Research Facility as partner to the EU SAF Clearing House managed by EASA, performs to advance SAF Producer’s commercial readiness with data that shows they have a viable product, and with coaching to show how the product can be made viable.”",https://www.tcd.ie/news_events/top-stories/featured/minister-obrien-saf-visit-/media/tcd/news-images/SMC-FINAL.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 18:56:54.247381

In a call with reporters Wednesday, Iowa corn and ethanol leaders, referencing the study conducted by Decision Innovation Solutions, said the demand gap – or the distance between total corn use and total corn production – will continue to increase.
The Decision Innovation Solutions study was “prepared for” Iowa Corn Growers Association and the Iowa Renewable Fuel Association, according to the report.
According to the study, the ultra-low carbon ethanol markets are large enough to sustain continued growth in corn production.
“Not all these fuel requirements will be filled with ultra-low carbon ethanol,” the study said.","A recent study prepared for the Iowa corn and ethanol industries predicts that without expanded markets, the “best days for corn growers are in the past.”

The study, and industry advocates, said the passage of year-round E15, a 15% ethanol ratio blend of fuel, will provide relief to farmers in the short term, but access to ultra-low carbon ethanol fuels will be necessary to sustain corn growers past 2030.

The study follows what the U.S. Department of Agriculture called a record year of corn production, with Iowa farmers growing 2.77 billion bushels of corn in 2025.

In a call with reporters Wednesday, Iowa corn and ethanol leaders, referencing the study conducted by Decision Innovation Solutions, said the demand gap – or the distance between total corn use and total corn production – will continue to increase. A bigger demand gap means lower corn prices, assuming 2025 corn acreage figures persist, which would make it harder for farmers to stay in business.

The Decision Innovation Solutions study was “prepared for” Iowa Corn Growers Association and the Iowa Renewable Fuel Association, according to the report.

Mark Mueller, Iowa Corn Growers Association president and a farmer near Waverly, said farmers are already working on “very very tight margins.”

“I am a fourth-generation farmer, and I am nervous that there won’t be a fifth generation Mueller farming on my family land,” Mueller said. “…The bottom line is that we have high input prices, we have low commodity prices, and we’re producing more corn all the time. We need more places to move our corn, and while Iowa corn is working towards that, it’s just a tough, tough road for the farming community.”

The study examined several potential trajectories for corn and ethanol industries. First, if production trends continue to increase, corn acreage planted remains at 2025 levels and ethanol demand is not increased by the nationwide, year-round sale of E15 fuel, the demand gap “rises sharply.”

Monte Shaw, the executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said this option puts the farm economy into a “capital C crisis” where farmers would be asking taxpayers for tens of billions of dollars in farm support payments.

If Congress is able to pass a bill permitting the year-round sale of 15% ethanol blends at gas stations nationwide, the study shows it would increase corn demand by about 2.1 billion bushels by 2031.

According to the study, the expanded ethanol market with E15 fuels would cause the demand gap to diminish, reaching almost zero by 2030. The electrification and improved fuel efficiency of vehicles, combined with farmers’ anticipated increases in production, would cause the gap to again increase after 2031.

Shaw said he hopes nationwide, year-round E15 can be included one of the final spending bills Congress has to pass this year.

“I think that’s going to be the single most important ag-policy decision that’s made this decade,” Shaw said. “It literally sets us up to move forward or to go into a very bad place.”

Dave Miller, chief economist with Decision Innovation Solutions, said ethanol production will have to turn to marine and aviation markets as the industries begin to transition away from fossil fuels.

“E15 is not a sufficient long-term solution,” Miller said. “It is a near-term solution that is very powerful, but in the long run, we need to be able to take, and access, two great big markets that exist.”

Ethanol and corn industry leaders say the best way for them to enter the ultra-low carbon ethanol market, which is the type of fuel the marine and aviation industries seek, is to obtain access to carbon capture and sequestration technologies.

Several companies have attempted to build carbon sequestration pipelines through Iowa to connect to ethanol plants for this purpose over the past several years. The Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline obtained a permit from the state regulating board, but the progress of the pipeline has been tied up in legal and legislative fights.

Environmental groups like the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter and groups of landowners argue the transportation of sequestered carbon dioxide is not a public use, and therefore that the pipeline should not be able to use eminent domain to obtain rights-of-way.

The House is scheduled to debate a bill Wednesday that would ban the use of eminent domain for carbon capture pipelines, and Summit says, would kill the project. A bill in the Senate seeks to address the issue by allowing pipeline operators to deviate from their approved paths in favor of landowners who are willing to have the pipeline on their properties.

Shaw said this is the second battle the ethanol and corn industries have to fight.

“Right now there are people who are trying to slam the door on the future markets of Iowa agriculture, and we’re trying hard to say, no, let’s not do that,” Shaw said.

According to the study, the ultra-low carbon ethanol markets are large enough to sustain continued growth in corn production. Per the study, the marine fuel market represents a 70-80 billion gallon per-year fuel market and sustainable aviation fuel has the potential for 35 billion gallons per year.

“Not all these fuel requirements will be filled with ultra-low carbon ethanol,” the study said. “But these new markets are sufficiently large to close the gap on corn demand through 2050, if only we have the foresight to do so.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9641-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 16:58:09.756834

ETJ could provide a new outlet for corn and ethanol production in the United States, supporting a sector—aviation—that has few low-carbon alternatives.
The next several years will determine the extent to which ETJ’s potential translates into notable and sustained quantities of SAF production.","Sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) are widely viewed as one of the few near-term options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from aviation, but current production volumes make up a small fraction of total jet fuel use. As the United States explores options to scale SAFs, ethanol-to-jet (ETJ)—a pathway that converts ethanol into synthetic jet fuel—has emerged as an option that can leverage the country’s large capacity for ethanol production.

The United States produces about 15 billion gallons of ethanol per year, mostly from corn and mostly blended into gasoline. Future adoption of electric vehicles could cause the market for ethanol used in gasoline blending to plateau or shrink. At the same time, aviation demand is expected to grow over time, and aircraft will continue to require energy-dense liquid fuels. ETJ therefore could redirect some ethanol production toward a sector with growing fuel demand and limited near-term alternatives to liquid fuels.

ETJ is relatively new at commercial scale: LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels began commercial SAF production using ETJ in 2024; other firms—including Gevo and Summit Next Gen—also are pursuing ETJ projects. Yet, questions remain about the carbon intensity of SAF produced via ETJ, and the market signals for longer-term expansion of ETJ production capacity remain unclear.

This blog post reviews why ETJ may warrant closer attention, what constrains its development, and what to watch over the next few years.

How Ethanol-to-Jet Works

The ETJ process has two stages. First, ethanol is produced from biomass such as corn, sugarcane, sugar beets, or cellulosic materials. Second, the ethanol is converted into jet fuel. ETJ facilities can either buy ethanol from existing ethanol plants or produce it on-site.

For corn-based ETJ, ethanol production involves converting cornstarch into sugars that are fermented into ethanol. This process also produces distillers’ grains as coproducts; these are commonly used as livestock feed. The ethanol is then distilled and dehydrated. Additional processing steps link carbon molecules into longer chains and use hydrogen to upgrade the chains into molecules that meet aviation fuel standards.

How Ethanol-to-Jet Compares to the Dominant Pathway

Most SAF produced in the United States comes from the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway. HEFA uses vegetable oils, waste fats, and waste oils as inputs and relies on the same basic equipment used to make renewable diesel—a fuel already produced at commercial scale in the United States. So, plants producing SAF with HEFA face lower capital costs than other technological pathways.

The challenge with HEFA is feedstock cost. Based on wholesale price data for crude soybean oil from the US Department of Agriculture, soybean oil—a major HEFA input in the United States—cost roughly $3–$4 per gallon of oil in 2024. In contrast, petroleum jet fuel cost roughly $2–$3 per gallon. This price differential means that the SAF feedstock alone costs more than the fossil fuel it replaces. Absent policy support or mandates, the SAF that results from this feedstock cannot be cost competitive with petroleum jet fuel, even before accounting for SAF capital or operating expenses.

Beyond cost, the scalability of HEFA-based SAF is also constrained by competition for feedstock with food, animal feed, and other fuel uses, notably biodiesel and renewable diesel.

In contrast, ETJ requires notable up-front capital investment, because existing ethanol infrastructure does not include the facilities needed to convert ethanol to jet fuel. However, SAF produced via ETJ can come with lower feedstock costs when corn ethanol is used, as corn ethanol is cheaper than HEFA feedstocks. The larger, lower-cost supply of corn ethanol can make the production of ETJ-based SAF easier to scale than HEFA-based SAF.

Greenhouse gas emissions associated with biofuels such as SAFs depend on how the fuel is made. Policy and compliance programs assess these emissions using life-cycle analysis; this analysis considers greenhouse gas emissions across the fuel supply chain, including feedstock production, transportation, processing, and combustion. Some of the emissions released during fuel combustion and processing are offset by carbon uptake during biomass growth.

Many policy-relevant frameworks for life-cycle analysis also account for emissions from indirect land use change—land use changes that occur when higher crop demand shifts global agricultural production, leading to conversion of forests or other land to cropland, thus releasing carbon previously stored in forests, grasslands, and soils.

Life-cycle analysis aggregates these components into a single metric—carbon intensity—defined as total greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy. Carbon intensity plays a central role in determining whether a fuel qualifies for programs such as the federal Renewable Fuel Standard, California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, and the Clean Fuel Production tax credits. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, administered by the International Civil Aviation Organization, also uses carbon intensity scores to determine whether airlines may use a given fuel for compliance and the emissions reductions the airlines may claim under the scheme. These policies vary in the life-cycle analysis models they use and how the resulting carbon intensity scores help determine compliance or incentives.

Life-cycle analysis models vary in their treatment of several factors, reflecting ongoing methodological debates related to life-cycle analysis, which can lead to different carbon intensity scores for the same fuel. Such factors include upstream agricultural practices (e.g., cover cropping, reduced tillage, or nitrogen management), electricity emissions, coproducts, and indirect land use change, among others. For example, how models account for the potential of distillers’ grains to displace other animal feeds can materially affect the carbon intensity score assigned to ethanol.

Policies also can vary in terms of which emissions count toward the carbon intensity score. For example, early implementation of the Clean Fuel Production tax credit based credit eligibility on a score that accounted for indirect land use change, while subsequent updates to the credit under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act excluded indirect land use change from the emissions calculation.

The Carbon-Intensity Challenge

The ETJ process releases greenhouse emissions at several points—during fermentation, during electricity generation and natural gas combustion used for distillation and dehydration, during the production of hydrogen used for hydroprocessing (which can be emissions intensive if the hydrogen is made from fossil natural gas), and during upstream agricultural activities.

In many commonly used life-cycle analysis models, the carbon intensity of SAF produced by corn-based ETJ is, at best, modestly lower than that of petroleum jet fuel, and relatively high compared to other methods of producing SAF. Without process improvements, the ETJ pathway using conventional corn ethanol would yield only small reductions in greenhouse gases (if any) relative to petroleum jet fuel; hence, ETJ via corn ethanol likely would receive limited support under policies that condition incentives on achieving low carbon intensity.

At the same time, research suggests that the emissions associated with SAF produced via corn-based ETJ could be reduced substantially if production practices change. Recent analysis by the EFI Foundation uses Argonne National Laboratory’s Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies (GREET) model —specifically its research-and-development version, commonly used in academic analysis—to show how the carbon intensity score of corn-based ETJ SAF can be reduced through carbon-reduction measures across the supply chain. These measures can include carbon capture and long-term storage at fermentation, lower-carbon energy use across the supply chain, use of renewable hydrogen, and improved feedstock cultivation practices. Under GREET’s accounting assumptions, the report estimates that a set of readily deployable, low-cost measures could reduce the carbon intensity score of corn-based ETJ SAF by up to 89 percent. With costlier but more aggressive emissions-reduction measures, the report finds carbon-intensity reductions of up to 104 percent, implying net-negative life-cycle emissions.

Importantly, these estimated reductions depend on methodological assumptions in GREET, some of which—including how changes in cultivation practices should be credited—remain debated in the context of life-cycle analysis. This continued debate means that the magnitude of estimated emissions reductions could differ depending on the accounting choices.

An alternative in the longer term is to produce SAF via ETJ using cellulosic ethanol, which can reduce upstream emissions and receives a lower carbon intensity score than corn ethanol in life-cycle analysis models. However, cellulosic ethanol currently has lower technological readiness and higher costs. In both cases, the competitiveness of lower-carbon ETJ SAF depends on the costs of achieving and verifying emissions reductions.

The Demand Question

Unlike in the European Union, no regulations require airlines in the United States to buy meaningful volumes of SAF. Current offtake agreements for all types of SAF mostly reflect voluntary commitments from airlines to signal environmental stewardship. Given that the airline industry is highly price sensitive, such environmental commitments are limited in scale and would expand only if SAF costs fall.

The Clean Fuel Production tax credits will help with SAF project financing in the near term but may not be sufficient to close the cost gap with conventional jet fuel. Because the tax credits are slated to end in 2029, they also do not create strong long-term incentives for investment. In principle, SAF producers can generate credits under longer-term programs such as the federal Renewable Fuel Standard or state Low Carbon Fuel Standards if the production pathways are certified under these programs, which can help narrow the cost gap between SAFs and traditional jet fuels. Whether ETJ qualifies for these policies (or generates meaningful compliance value under these policies) will depend on achieving materially lower carbon intensity scores under program-specific life-cycle analysis.

ETJ could provide a new outlet for corn and ethanol production in the United States, supporting a sector—aviation—that has few low-carbon alternatives. However, the climate performance of SAF produced via ETJ depends on achieving and verifying lower carbon intensity across the supply chain. Analysis by the EFI Foundation suggests that substantial reductions in carbon intensity may be achievable through measures that impose relatively low additional cost.

The trajectory of ETJ will depend on whether these reductions can be documented under relevant and trusted frameworks for life-cycle analysis used by SAF policies and voluntary buyers. The future of ETJ also will depend on the capital required to build new facilities, future policy signals for SAF demand, and cost reductions that bring SAF produced via ETJ closer to the price of petroleum jet fuel. The next several years will determine the extent to which ETJ’s potential translates into notable and sustained quantities of SAF production.",https://media.rff.org/images/shutterstock_2140528403.width-600.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 16:58:31.384451

The European Union has taken a significant step toward decarbonising the aviation sector by implementing a mandatory blending requirement for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Under the ‘RefuelEU Aviation’ initiative, the EU mandated that, as of last year, a minimum of 2% of the jet fuel made available at its airports must be SAF.

EU’s aggressive SAF mandate

This requirement is not static but is designed to ramp up aggressively over time, reflecting the urgency of the climate crisis and the need for technological adoption.

Specifically, the mandated share of SAF will more than triple to 6% by 2030, marking an important mid-term milestone.

The trajectory continues upward, with the requirement set to reach a substantial 20% by 2035.

This progressive increase is intended to drive investment in SAF production capacity, reduce the aviation industry’s reliance on fossil fuels, and ensure a sustainable pathway for European air travel, positioning the EU as a global leader in aviation sustainability policy.

Speaking at a World Economic Forum panel on clean fuels, Pouyanne predicted that the European SAF regulation would follow the same path as the car regulation.

Pouyanne Bets on Regulatory Backtrack

Pouyanne was quoted as saying in a Reuters report:

All the airline companies are fighting the 6% SAF mandate, which frankly is easy to reach…I will make a bet today that what happened to the car regulation will happen to the SAF regulation in Europe.

TotalEnergies has established production of SAF across a number of its refineries and has articulated plans for further capacity expansion in this area.

However, the company has recently put a pause on planned investments aimed at significantly increasing this SAF production capacity.

This decision stems from market feedback indicating a lack of strong demand from their client base for volumes exceeding those required to meet current and forthcoming regulatory obligations within the European Union.

Essentially, the immediate demand for SAF appears to be driven by compliance with EU mandates rather than a broad, voluntary shift toward lower-emission fuels by airlines and other customers.

Price and compliance against demand

This situation suggests a broader challenge within the nascent SAF market: the current price premium associated with SAF, which is typically higher than that of conventional jet fuel, is proving to be a deterrent to wider adoption in the absence of stringent regulatory requirements.

As a result, TotalEnergies is recalibrating its investment strategy to align with the more conservative demand outlook primarily dictated by the EU’s blending mandates and quotas, rather than aggressive market penetration based on anticipated voluntary commitments.

SAF costs three to four times more than traditional oil-refined jet fuel.

While airline companies cite inadequate production volumes for their slow adoption of SAF, Pouyanne has dismissed this explanation.

Pouyanne stated that he was facing customers, specifically his airline companies in Europe, who were making a huge lobby effort and accusing them of not investing enough, an accusation he claimed was completely wrong.

I will be able to provide 10% of SAF to the airline companies in Europe by 2030, but…everybody is dreaming they can have these biofuels at the same price as (jet fuel made from) oil, but it’s not true.

Due to uncertainty surrounding regulations, the CEO indicated that he would probably reduce investments in low-carbon fuels.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 14:57:49.338846

The major investment comes as the Government drives forward plans for expansion at Heathrow, Gatwick and Luton airports and the Transport Secretary will today chair a meeting with prominent airlines, airports, innovators and engineering firms to discuss how cutting-edge technology will decarbonise the sector while delivering growth.

With the production of low-carbon fuels alone expected to add up to £5 billion to the economy by 2050, the funding will drive millions of pounds of private investment into the aviation sector, supporting skilled jobs in technology development and scientific research and funding projects to slash emissions from aviation.

Businesses, researchers and universities across the UK will be invited to bid for their share of the £43 million, with competitions launching from February to allocate the funding. The funding will go towards research and development projects that help to deliver net zero aviation by 2050.

Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, said: ""We’re backing UK businesses by powering up green aviation. Our £43 million investment will deliver the cutting-edge technology of the future, grow the economy and support highly skilled jobs as part of our mission to deliver national renewal.

""Zero emission aircraft, hydrogen fuels and other emerging technologies are vital to reduce the climate impacts from flying and will enable us to deliver our airport expansion plans to boost connectivity and grow the economy.""

The technologies that will be developed with this funding, such as clean fuels and zero-emission aircraft, will play an important role in delivering on the government’s vision to expand airports in line with climate targets, by decarbonising aviation and improving air quality.

The investment could also be used for a trial to understand how contrails – condensation trails produced from aircraft exhausts that can contribute to global warming – could be avoided.

The Civil Aviation Authority will develop regulations required for the widespread use of hydrogen fuel through this investment – including support for pioneering companies and universities that are preparing for new zero carbon technology.

To further the UK’s world-leading reputation on green aviation, some of this funding will support the use and tracking of sustainable aviation fuels in regions like Africa and the Caribbean and improve their participation in schemes that offset global aviation emissions.

This will ensure UK airlines are not at a financial disadvantage to airlines based in low-income countries, who can avoid the costs associated with carbon offsetting because they do not have the required tracking and implementation tools.

In further support for the sector, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill, coming into force later this year, will provide long-term certainty for the SAF market by guaranteeing a set price for UK producers, helping the UK meet its climate targets.

This is backed by an additional £63 million to accelerate new SAF production plants, alongside £2.3 billion through the Aerospace Technology Institute programme over the next decade to support cutting-edge aerospace innovation and thousands of highly skilled jobs.

The Hydrogen in Aviation Alliance said: 'The funding for green aviation projects announced today will help ensure the UK leads the future of flight. Hydrogen-powered aviation is at the heart of this ambition and is essential to decarbonising aviation while ensuring the sustainable growth of our industry.

Among SAF production pathways, alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) stands out for its scalability, supported by abundant feedstock availability and a well-established bioethanol industry. However, significant reductions in SAF carbon intensity (CI) require the use of future feedstocks (e.g., cellulosic) whose adoption is hindered by high capital costs for feedstock processing and ethanol upgrading. Here, we evaluate the financial viability and environmental implications of integrating an ATJ SAF biorefinery within a petroleum refinery, utilizing miscanthus and switchgrass as example feedstocks. Three scenarios are evaluated: standalone (benchmark), colocated, and repurposing (coprocessing SAF within the petroleum refinery). Results show repurposing reduces baseline capital costs by 36% and SAF minimum selling price (MSP) by 12% to 8.14 USD·gal–1; the superior performance of repurposing is consistent across both feedstocks.

As trade policy and geopolitical dynamics continue to create economic uncertainty around the globe, a robust domestic biofuel market would provide much needed stability and market opportunities for U.S. soybean farmers.

Instead of continued imports of biofuel and biofuel feedstocks that leave our value chain vulnerable to supply chain manipulation, ASA is advocating for policy outcomes that strengthen domestic soy demand and support U.S. soybean farmers.

Biofuel is a broad term that includes biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, as well as the smaller markets of soy-derived naphtha, liquified petroleum gas and home heating oil.

The domestic biofuel industry can play a critical role in national security and economic stability – and biofuel is produced right here on U.S. soil. Roughly half of all U.S.-processed soybean oil is used in biomass-based diesel, making biofuel one of the most significant domestic markets for soybeans.

The Current State of Biofuel

Biofuel encompasses a wide range of fuels, feedstocks and policy frameworks, but ASA is currently focused on two specific policy issues – the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit and the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) renewable volume obligations (RVOs). Clear guidance aligning with recently enacted amendments to the 45Z tax credit will help determine the economics of producing low-carbon fuels, while RVOs for 2026 and 2027 will establish the level of biofuel blending required under the RFS. Both directly affect soybean oil utilization, domestic crush expansion and market certainty for farmers. When U.S.-grown soybean oil is used in domestic biofuel production, it strengthens rural economies, reduces greenhouse gas emissions and lowers reliance on finite energy sources. How these policies are structured ultimately determines whether American clean fuel policy delivers its intended economic and environmental benefits to U.S. farmers and consumers alike.

45Z Tax Credit

In July 2025, the 45Z tax credit was amended through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) to enhance benefits to soy-based biofuel, but final guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury has yet to be completed. ASA is advocating for swift draft guidance from the Treasury Department to ensure timely implementation. The tax credit is important to soybean farmers because it incentivizes fuel producers to purchase soybean oil for biodiesel and renewable diesel.

To qualify for the 45Z tax credit, fuel producers must utilize feedstocks produced in North America. Finalization of 45Z is critical because it will boost domestic feedstock demand and support stronger soybean prices. The tax credit also protects domestically grown agricultural feedstocks and removes incentives for imported waste feedstocks, which have exponentially increased market share in U.S. biofuel production over the past five years.

“We led advocacy efforts and did so in coordination with other ag commodity groups and soybean processors as Congress was developing tax code changes in the OBBBA,” said Alexa Combelic, executive director of government affairs for ASA. “These advocacy efforts led to an incredible win for ASA in relation to the 45Z tax credits. We were able to remove the indirect land use change penalty on agricultural biofuel feedstocks, which effectively doubles the value of the tax credit for soy biofuel. In addition, we were able to address the surge of imported feedstocks entering our biofuel production value chain through new limitations on tax credit eligibility.”

Up until the week before the OBBBA was passed, Combelic said it wasn’t clear if the North American feedstock “ringfence” would be included in the final bill. Through significant grassroots stakeholder mobilization and advocacy leadership, ASA was able to ensure the tax credit would focus on biofuel feedstocks grown and produced in North America rather than overseas.

Additionally, through months of education on the impacts of agricultural indirect land use change (ILUC) penalties, ASA was able to double the 45Z credit rate for soy-based biofuel. The ILUC penalty was an arbitrary tax on U.S. farmers, and its removal means the carbon intensity of soy is based on its direct impacts and not tied to a calculation model that penalizes U.S. grown crops for farming behavior in South America.

This win was not only the product of the hard work of ASA Government Affairs, but also of the efforts by farmers who helped ensure lawmakers were hearing directly from their constituents about the importance of the tax credit amendments to the soybean industry. The 45Z credit was first established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which restructured biofuel tax credits based on carbon intensity and initially disadvantaged agricultural feedstocks. Through mechanisms like ILUC, the IRA policy created an incentive for imported waste feedstocks like tallow, primarily from Brazil, and used cooking oil, primarily from China. Now, the 45Z tax credit as updated by the OBBBA disincentivizes those imports by prioritizing feedstocks available at home through a North American ringfence of eligibility and by removing arbitrary credit reductions for agricultural products.

The next step to ensure utilization of 45Z is for the Treasury Department to develop tax guidance that outlines how biofuel producers can utilize this tax credit after the statutory changes enacted through OBBBA. At this time, ASA is continuing to engage with the Treasury Department and administration to highlight the sense of urgency. While interim or draft guidance is expected this winter, final guidance will only be published after a public comment period and agency review.

“We anticipate full final guidance by spring or summer,” Combelic said.

RVOs

The RVO rule for compliance years 2026 and 2027 as proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will lead to an increase in blending volumes for biomass-based diesel – a policy that supports soybean farmers, soybean processors and biofuel producers. Released by EPA in June 2025, this was the strongest proposed RVO rule ever published. It was the direct result of continued advocacy with this administration.

“The previous Trump administration was not the biggest advocate for biofuel, so we were thrilled to see this change in tune,” Combelic said. It shows a clear focus on wanting to be a partner as we seek to increase domestic markets for soybean oil. Based on the two-year draft rule, if finalized, the biofuel value chain would absorb 10% of the average soybean sales to China in the first year and 20% of soybean sales to China in the second year.

The current RVOs, released under the Biden Administration EPA in 2023, underestimated industry capacity, weakening demand for soybean oil. The 2023-2025 RVOs did not reflect the expansion of the biofuel value chain – production and soybean crush. At that time, ASA was disappointed that blending volumes were not higher. The 2026 volumes versus the 2025 volumes shows an increase of over 2 billion gallons. This is a historic increase in volume requirements for biomass-based diesel. ASA applauded the proposal but continues to push for higher volume targets going forward in order to stabilize the market and secure long-term growth.

2025 marked the 20th anniversary of the RFS, and the EPA proposal in June marked a perfect reason for ASA to celebrate the program. The RFS program was enacted in 2005 through the passage of the Energy Policy Act and has been improved over the years, resulting in a new era that puts farmers first and strengthens the domestic biofuel industry. When President Trump began his term, he signed an Executive Order that created policy in support of American energy dominance. Domestic biofuel production fits right into that idea as from soil to final fuel production, it can be produced exclusively within the United States.

While soybean farmers have struggled to maintain biofuel feedstock market share amid the rapidly surging flood of cheap, foreign feedstocks, the proposed 2026-2027 RVO rule addresses concerns of fraudulent used cooking oil coming into the United States through a novel proposal to reduce Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credit values by 50% for imported biofuel and biofuel made from imported feedstocks. It encourages domestic biofuel production, strengthening domestic soybean markets and making domestic feedstocks more competitive. The 50% RIN credit reduction proposed by EPA is yet another opportunity to continue disincentivizing foreign feedstocks from being imported into the U.S.

A Bipartisan Issue

Because domestic biofuel creates a market for farmers and provides a boon for rural communities, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle support biofuel policies which increase domestic production, making it a true bipartisan issue. Domestic biofuel production creates jobs, opens a market for soybean farmers and bolsters the use of a product planted, harvested, created and consumed all within the United States. Biofuel policy is a flexible issue that supports the values of both political parties – a win-win for all.

ASA saw additional success on Capitol Hill last year as there was a strong coalition of advocates who helped them see bipartisan caucus support using agriculture feedstocks. When the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit was first released, the North American ringfence was only included in the House of Representatives, with the Senate later striking the measure. However, through ASA’s targeted and continued engagement, an ad hoc coalition of biofuel producers, soybean processors and farmers from a variety of commodities advocated for the ringfence to be reinstated, and it was restored in an updated version of the text released by the Senate the week of passage, ensuring eligible feedstocks will be permanently limited to North American origin points for the life of the 45Z tax credit.

The Future of Biofuel

Looking to the future of biofuel, ASA is calling for the completion of EPA’s proposed 2026-2027 Renewable Fuel Standard renewable volume obligations and issuing timely Treasury guidance for the revised 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit to reflect enacted changes that prioritize domestic agricultural feedstocks. On Nov. 12, 2025, ASA and the National Oilseed Processors Association (NOPA) sent a letter to President Trump urging swift finalization of these key federal biofuel policies which are critical to strengthen domestic demand and support farmers who are facing continued market pressure.

As ASA continues to advocate for the good of the soy community, the Association is continuously engaging with USDA, EPA, Treasury, the U.S. Trade Representative and additional senior staff at the White House. Biofuel policy is an issue that spans beyond one agency. It takes a team effort to make a difference, and ASA is focused on coalition building, legislative education and advocacy at the highest level of government.",https://soygrowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CAM36806-lower-res-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 14:58:11.102174

Mazour and other pipeline opponents have called for a bill banning the use of eminent domain for carbon pipelines, which the House advanced through a committee last week.
So, it should not be allowed to have eminent domain,” she said.
Speaker Pat Grassley, R-New Hartford, has repeatedly said that House Republicans want to target the use of eminent domain.","Proposed pipeline routes would be widened under a bill introduced Tuesday by Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, which he said would “all but eliminate the need” for pipeline companies to use eminent domain.

He said the bill, Senate File 2067, would address the concerns of landowners who don’t want a pipeline crossing their land, while also ensuring projects like a proposed carbon capture pipeline can move forward and open access to new markets for Iowa’s agricultural products.

“I believe the proposals we are introducing today in the Senate can get us to the point where we all but eliminate the need for utilizing eminent domain for carbon capture pipelines or any other hazardous liquid pipelines, while still recognizing the fact that Iowa needs to have investment in linear infrastructure, but also recognizing the importance of landowner rights,” Klimesh said.

His bill would widen the pipeline corridor, giving pipeline companies more flexibility to find a route around unwilling landowners by seeking voluntary land use agreements within 5 miles of a proposed pipeline. Landowners could opt out of being contacted by a pipeline company, except by mail.

Before requesting permission to use eminent domain, pipeline companies would have to provide evidence to the Iowa Utilities Commission showing why they could not find a route around landowners who do not want a pipeline on their land.

“And the way we have the bill structured, due diligence is of the utmost importance to ensure the pipeline companies check all the boxes to make sure that, you know, before they make the request, that they’ve done everything they can possibly do to find a voluntary corridor,” Klimesh said.

He said the bill would apply retroactively and widen the corridor for phase one of the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline.

Klimesh said building the carbon capture pipeline would lower the carbon intensity score of ethanol made in Iowa, making it marketable for uses like sustainable aviation fuel and enhanced oil recovery.

“That would make Iowa farmers profitable again and have a huge impact on Iowa’s overall economic health,” he said. “Access to these markets is not optional for Iowa farmers and Iowa. It is a necessity.”

Key pipeline opponent says bill won't help landowners

Jess Mazour, conservation program associate at the Sierra Club, has been a leading opponent of using eminent domain for carbon capture pipelines. She said pipeline companies already have the option to find alternate routes around unwilling landowners, and Klimesh’s bill doesn’t guarantee protection from eminent domain.

“So, a lot of the stuff that he’s saying is simply just a misdirection and a distraction away from the issue at hand, which is property rights and the ability for someone to say no, and that’s not addressed in his bill whatsoever,” Mazour said.

Mazour and other pipeline opponents have called for a bill banning the use of eminent domain for carbon pipelines, which the House advanced through a committee last week.

“The bottom line is this: this project has no public purpose, no public convenience or necessity, and it’s not a public use. So, it should not be allowed to have eminent domain,” she said.

Pipeline supporters say the bill could help build carbon pipelines in Iowa

Kelly Nieuwenhuis, who farms in O’Brien County, was at the Capitol on Tuesday with a group of carbon pipeline supporters. He said he wants lawmakers to help make the pipeline happen.

“As a corn farmer, you know, we’re kind of tough times right now,” Nieuwenhuis said. “We need to grow demand for what we produce, and this project will create a lot of growth in demand for the corn producers across the state of Iowa.”

He said he has neighbors who didn’t want the Summit pipeline on their land, so he and his brothers volunteered their own property.

“They moved the pipeline like 100 yards across the fence line into ours, and we signed easements with them,” Nieuwenhuis said. “So that’s why I think widening the corridor will help find those people that are willing to put the pipeline in their property.”

Sabrina Zenor, spokesperson for Summit Carbon Solutions, said the company is neutral on the bill.

“As proposals like this are considered, it’s important to maintain clarity, respect landowner interests, and avoid limiting economic opportunity for agriculture and rural communities,” she said in a statement. “We remain committed to working with landowners and policymakers on solutions that protect property rights and support rural economies.”

Other groups that support the pipelines, like the American Carbon Alliance and the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, expressed support for Klimesh’s bill.

Klimesh also proposed a second bill, SF 2069, that would put a severance tax on liquid carbon dioxide flowing through pipelines in Iowa. He said the money would be added to the Taxpayer Relief Fund and potentially used to continue lowering the state’s income tax.

House Republicans take a different approach

Klimesh’s proposals came a week after House Republicans advanced their own bill, House File 2104, to ban the use of eminent domain for carbon capture pipelines, a policy supported by landowners who oppose the pipelines.

Speaker Pat Grassley, R-New Hartford, has repeatedly said that House Republicans want to target the use of eminent domain. But he also said last week that it’s a positive sign that Senate Republicans are proposing legislation on the issue.

“It sounds like the Senate is at least looking at solutions,” Grassley said. “Now that doesn’t mean necessarily we’re going to all start in an agreement, but I think it’s a positive sign that both sides of the rotunda are working on something.”

The visit underscores Ireland's commitment to advancing sustainable aviation and accelerating the decarbonisation of the global aviation sector.

The research facility, located at SMBC Aviation Capital's Fitzwilliam 28 offices, represents a unique collaboration between the aircraft leasing industry and academia to address one of aviation's most pressing challenges. As the sector works toward net-zero emissions by 2050, Sustainable Aviation Fuel is emerging as the most viable near-term decarbonisation solution available.

SAF is a ""drop-in"" alternative to conventional jet fuel that can be used in existing aircraft and engines, resulting in lifecycle CO₂ emissions reductions of up to 70-80%. While challenges around affordability and availability remain, SAF represents the current best option for reducing aviation's carbon footprint in the short to medium term.

The visit comes following the recent publication of Ireland's Sustainable Aviation Fuel Policy Roadmap by the Department of Transport, which was assisted by the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Task Force, including aviation lessors and other key stakeholders. The Roadmap identifies key opportunities and pathways for advancing SAF deployment in Ireland.

“It was a privilege to welcome Minister for Transport, Darragh O’Brien to the Trinity College Dublin SAF Research facility located at our Dublin headquarters. The development and adoption of sustainable aviation fuel is a critical decarbonisation lever for the industry, and meaningful progress depends on strong collaboration between policymakers, academia and the private sector. We are proud to contribute to this effort and this visit reflects the shared commitment to building a more sustainable aviation future.”

Professor Stephen Dooley, Director of the Trinity College SAF Research Facility, said:

“Sustainable Aviation Fuels are the essential method to decarbonise aviation. SAFs are being made from a wide range of non-fossil feedstocks by technological innovations from all over the world. Due to the safety requirements of aviation, all aviation fuels including SAFs are subject to rigorous data intensive technical evaluation. Currently this evaluation is performed on a case by case basis, and this is the work that the SAF Research Facility as partner to the EU SAF Clearing House managed by EASA, performs to advance SAF Producer’s commercial readiness with data that shows they have a viable product, and with coaching to show how the product can be made viable.”

Ireland is uniquely positioned to contribute to global aviation decarbonisation, with more than 50% of the world's leased aircraft owned or managed from the country. SMBC Aviation Capital recognises its responsibility to accelerate the transition to more sustainable aviation. The company aims to own at least an 80% new technology fleet by 2030, supporting airline customers through the provision of newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft.

SMBC Aviation Capital looks forward to continuing to work with the Department of Transport and stakeholders across the aviation value chain to accelerate the development of a viable SAF market. Together with advances in aircraft technology and operational improvements, SAF will be essential to achieving the industry's net-zero ambitions.

The plant is to be built in the central department of Durazno, with deliveries expected to begin in 2028.

The agreement was signed with U.S.-based Syzygy Plasmonics, which specializes in low-emissions fuel technologies. The contract guarantees full commercialization of the fuel to be produced by NovaSAF-1, the company's first commercial-scale plant, and is considered key to reaching the project's financial goals.

The fuel is an alternative to conventional jet fuel, and it will significantly reduce aviation emissions without requiring changes to existing aircraft engines or infrastructure, those involved in the project said.

Sustainable aviation fuel can be used directly in today's aircraft when blended with conventional fossil jet fuel, making it one of the most immediately available options for decarbonizing aviation.

The plant is to be built in adjacent to the facilities of Estancias del Lago, one of Uruguay's largest dairy and agroenergy companies.

The process will use biogas generated from agricultural waste as its main feedstock, combined with renewable electricity supplied by Uruguay's power grid, which is largely based on renewable sources.

Syzygy will use its proprietary technology based on light-activated chemical reactors powered by renewable electricity.

The system already has received international precertification that allows production of renewable fuels of non-biological origin, a category considered essential to meeting the environmental regulations being adopted by aviation markets.

In its initial phase, the plant is expected to produce more than 350,000 gallons of sustainable aviation fuel per year.

According to the companies, using the fuel in aircraft as a replacement for pure fossil-based jet fuel can reduce lifecycle emissions by between 80% and 90%.

The company said the final product will be fully compatible with today's commercial aviation fleet.

For Trafigura, the agreement is part of its strategy to expand its low-emissions fuels portfolio. The Switzerland-based group operates globally in energy trading and controls industrial and distribution assets, including Puma Energy.

""By providing commercial certainty through offtake agreements, we enable emerging technologies to secure project financing and scale up production,"" Jason Breslaw, Trafigura's global head of low-carbon fuels business development, said in a statement.

According to industry outlet Surtidores Latam, liquid biofuels are becoming a central tool for both transport decarbonization and energy security.

The milestone comes at a pivotal moment for aviation, as expanding SAF mandates intersect with tightening availability of sustainable feedstocks, a constraint identified in the Global Feedstock Assessment for SAF Production: Outlook to 2050. Syzygy's solution addresses these constraints by combining abundant biogas with renewable electricity in a modular, electrified platform. At scale, Syzygy's deployment model is anticipated to be cost-competitive – and even out-perform – other SAF pathways, which rely on supply-constrained feedstocks such as used cooking oil. Trade named NovaSAF™, Syzygy's pathway has received ISCC pre-certification to produce Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO) and Advanced BioSAF compliant fuels. This gives Europe, the United Kingdom, and others another viable, scalable pathway to meet ambitious 2030 decarbonization mandates.

Despite the fossil-friendly direction of US energy policy, domestic innovators in the clean tech field just can’t stop innovating. Somewhat ironically, that’s especially true in the iconic oil and gas-producing state of Texas, where activity in the sustainable aviation fuel field has been stirring like a hornet’s nest. The latest news comes from Houston, where the startup Syzygy Plasmonics has just taken a big step towards pushing traditional kerosene jet fuel out of the picture.

The Case For Sustainable Aviation Fuel

In terms of aircraft decarbonization, sustainable aviation fuel seems like a second choice compared to electrification. Biofuels and other combustibles don’t eliminate tailpipe emissions, though they do help prevent new fossil fuels from circulating through the economy. Electrification would be the first choice, and that is already emerging in the areas of battery-electric and fuel cell-electric flight, including a new generation of electric VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) and wing-in-ground aircraft.

Still, so far the electrification movement has been confined to relatively small aircraft and shorter routes. Those short hops account for a significant amount of aircraft emissions, but the global fleet of full sized passenger planes and other upsized aircraft requires next-level propulsion systems that just aren’t ready yet.

That helps explain why investors have been pumping money into new alternative liquid fuels that can be used in existing aircraft, including fuel made from plastic waste and used cooking oil. Scaleup has proved slow, though, and in the meantime a different and potentially more effect approach to sustainable aviation fuel has emerged in the form of e-fuels, or electrofuels.

E-fuels leverage renewable electricity, green hydrogen, and captured carbon to synthesize new liquid hydrocarbon fuels that can serve as drop-in replacements for their fossil-sourced counterparts. The industry has already begun to scale up in Texas, one example being the massive Project Roadrunner facility under the wing of the US firm Infinium.

The Syzygy Plasmonics Solution

Syzygy has come up with a different variation on the e-fuels theme. The startup has developed a photocatalytic system that deploys renewable energy to produce light for a biogas reactor, now trademarked under the name Rigel™.

“Syzygy Plasmonics uses its proprietary Rigel™ photoreactor to run chemical reactions with light instead of combustion—cutting emissions and energy use,” the company explains. The catalysts are interchangeable, enabling the reactor to produce hydrogen, syngas, and other fuels and chemicals at a scalable rate from 1 ton to more than 100 tons per day.

On the sustainable aviation fuel side, Syzygy deploys waste gas culled from landfills, dairies, or wastewater, without relying on the high heat needed for conventional steam methane reforming. The technology was developed at Rice University in Texas over the course of two decades of research by Professors Naomi Halas and Peter Nordlander.

The idea of deploying light to create or break chemical bonds was first introduced by Japanese researchers back in the 1970s. That seems simple enough, but little progress was made towards commercial applications over the next 40 years. That changed after 2016, when Nordlander and Halas published their a new “antenna” system based on plasmonic metallic nanoparticles (see lots more details here).

The Oil & Gas Connection: Follow The Money

The alternative fuel field is ripe with skills and resources transferred from the oil and gas industry, and that applies to Syzygy as well. Along with Nordlander and Halas, the company was co-founded by two professionals in the industrial oil services field, Trevor Best and Dr. Suman Khatiwada. They came across the antenna solution while searching for a new business opportunity.

Syzygy soon caught the attention of the US Department of Energy, which supported the path to commercialization through its ARPA-E funding office. The National Science Foundation also chipped in with a small business grant, and then it was off to the races. By 2022, Syzygy was already into a $76 million Series C funding round led by Carbon Direct Capital, with investors including Aramco Ventures, Chevron Technology Ventures, Equinor Ventures, EVOK Innovations, GOOSE Capital, Sumitomo Corporation, and Toyota Ventures, among others.

In 2023, Syzygy also formed a strategic partnership with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America. “This investment will help Syzygy Plasmonics to accelerate commercialization and continue its development of innovative alternative technologies, particularly those that contribute to the hydrogen ecosystem and CO2 ecosystem,” Syzygy explained.

Syzygy finally came across the CleanTechnica radar in 2024, when the company applied its photocatalytic system to crack ammonia without running into the problem of NOX (nitrogen oxide) intermingling.

A Giant Step For The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Of The Future

Fast-forwarding to 2026, Syzygy is marketing a modular system under the trade name NovaSAF™. If all goes according to plan, the company’s first commercial-scale deployment will be the forthcoming NovaSAF-1 plant in Durazno, Uruguay.

“It will leverage biogas from the Estancias Del Lago powdered milk plant and Uruguayan renewable electricity to produce synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) SAF with 90% lower lifecycle emissions than fossil jet fuel while demonstrating attractive project economics,” Syzygy explained in a press statement on January 20, with SAF being short for Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

By attractive, they mean competitive with other alternative fuels. “At scale, Syzygy’s deployment model is anticipated to be cost-competitive – and even out-perform – other SAF pathways, which rely on supply-constrained feedstocks such as used cooking oil,” the company asserts.

In the same announcement Syzygy also noted that the leading global commodities firm Trafigura has agreed to a six-year, binding sustainable aviation fuel off-take agreement, indicating confidence in the company’s business model.

The Trafigura connection also indicates another fossil fuel crossover into the lower-carbon economy of the future. “We deploy infrastructure, market expertise and our worldwide logistics network to move oil and petroleum products, metals and minerals, gas and power from where they are produced to where they are needed,” the company says of itself, while noting that it is also investing in renewable energy ventures.

And, More Steps

In December, Syzygy completed the FEED (Front End Engineering Design) for NovaSAF-1. The next step is a fresh round of investment to begin construction, so it will take a while before the sustainable aviation fuel begins to flow from Uruguay. Nevertheless, Syzygy is already planning for global reach.

“With this commercial blueprint established, the company is positioned to replicate the project model globally and accelerate cost-competitive SAF production world-wide,” the company asserts.

That’s quite an ambition, considering the fossil-driven trajectory of domestic energy policy. However, it’s a big world out there, and the US is not the only market for sustainable fuels.

For that matter, an entire region of the US just doubled down on clean aviation. On January 8 the new Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator launched in Washington State, tasking itself to “rapidly accelerate production, deployment, and adoption of sustainable aviation fuel across the Pacific Northwest.”

Amazon, eBay and Etsy are among the companies involved in the initiative, which will enable the San Francisco-based startup Nevoya to begin deploying new Tesla Semi trucks later this year or early next. The fleet of Class 8 vehicles — the largest truck classification — is expected to travel up to 7 million miles and avoid an estimated 60,000 metric tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent emissions annually. All charging will be covered by renewable energy certificates.

Participating companies do not need to actually send shipments on the trucks to benefit from the emissions savings. Under the scheme, which is organized by the nonprofit Center for Green Market Activation (GMA), Nevoya will sell “environmental attribute certificates” (EACs) representing the emissions savings independently of contracts for freight. Buyers then deduct the emission savings represented by the certificates from their Scope 3 emissions, and retire the certificates to prevent further use.

Aviation playbook

Similar “book and claim” schemes are already being used to fund decarbonization of maritime shipping, cement, iron and other sectors. One well-established scheme — the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance, a project co-managed by GMA, Environmental Defense Fund and RMI — has aggregated $550 million in demand for sustainable aviation fuel certificates since 2021. Amazon and Visa are among its members

Like these other areas, road freight is challenging to decarbonize in part because zero-emission options come with a premium. Battery electric trucks usually cost about twice as much as equivalent internal combustion vehicles, according to the GMA. The need to create charging infrastructure and purchase renewable electricity can further increase the price.

There are companies willing to pay these premiums for at least some shipments, but they often struggle to find zero-emissions options because less than 1 percent of new heavy-duty vehicles in the U.S. are electric. The book-and-claim approach solves this problem by aggregating demand across interested companies, regardless of their ability to access electric trucks.

Scaling the project

GMA described the purchase of trucking EACs as a pilot and said it planned on further developing the project. One move that would accelerate progress would involve leading standard setters integrating EACs into their guidelines — something the Science Based Targets initiative is considering. “That will provide stakeholders with confidence in the accountability of these solutions,” said Andre de Fontaine, GMA managing director.

The center also plans on combining book-and-claim agreements with more traditional contracts that involve companies paying directly for zero-emissions shipping.

“Layering book and claim into these efforts can increase asset utilization — trucks and chargers — lowering overall costs for all buyers,” said de Fontaine. “As costs decrease, we expect more shippers to get involved, increasing demand and, in turn, driving greater production and deployment of zero-emission heavy-duty trucks.”",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Shutterstock-Image-2518658419.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 10:58:55.435479

In 2026, Hertz’s investment is focusing on a multi-brand fleet that includes General Motors and Polestar vehicles to better match consumer demand.

3. DHL

CEO: Tobias Meyer

Headquarters: Bonn, Germany

EV Fleet Size: 35,000+

DHL Group’s ""Sustainability Roadmap"" sets out a €7bn (US$8.2bn) global investment in green logistics by 2030.

In the UK, DHL Express has deployed 270 Ford E-Transit vans, which provide a 140-mile delivery range and a 1,000 kg payload.

By the end of 2026, the company aims for 30% of its own fleet to run on sustainable fuels or electricity.

Its policy is particularly robust in urban areas, where it is committed to a 100% electric courier fleet by 2030.

To support this, DHL has invested in ""EV-ready"" sites with scalable charging infrastructure.

Beyond vans, it is pioneering the use of electric cargo bikes and even electric ""Alice"" planes, reflecting a comprehensive policy that covers land, sea, and air to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

2. SF Express

CEO: Wang Wei

Headquarters: Shenzhen, China

EV Fleet Size: 40,000+

SF Express manages a huge green fleet of more than 40,000 new-energy vehicles.

In 2026, the company continues to replace traditional fuel vehicles with electric alternatives using a mix of self-purchase and leasing models.

Its policy focuses on ""Zero Carbon Future"" goals, involving the use of LFP batteries for cost-efficiency.

Beyond road transport, SF Express is investing in sustainable aviation fuel to decarbonise its extensive air-cargo network across China and Asia.

It has developed its own branded autonomous delivery vehicles, equipped with L4 driving capability, 5G connectivity and intelligent parcel containers.

SF Express also uses the Feihong 98, a large unmanned aerial vehicle with a 1.5-tonne capacity used for cargo, which is being tested for operations in rural and mountainous areas.

It's a slippery slope when you start taking away people's property rights, and I think there's going to be major pushback.","Jan 21 (Reuters) - (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a correspondent for Reuters. This column is part of the Reuters Sustainable Finance Newsletter, which you can sign up for here)

A year of changes by U.S. President Donald Trump and his securities regulators means a lot of uncertainty heading into the springtime shareholder meeting season.

The Reuters Daily Briefing newsletter provides all the news you need to start your day. Sign up here.

The developments have many expecting that shareholder resolutions will not play much of a role this spring. Apple , whose annual meeting date of February 24 is one of the earliest, faces only one resolution this year. (It focuses on Apple's business in China from the conservative-leaning National Center for Public Policy Research.) Contrast that with four resolutions at Apple last year and five in 2024.

So let's ‌see what happens. Trump's December 12 executive order on proxy solicitors did not restrict proxy voting by big index funds, once a right-wing priority, and a sign the administration may not wholly side ​with executives against investors.

To make sense of things, I spoke with Andrew Behar, CEO of activist investor group As You Sow, a frequent resolution filer and company interlocutor. This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.

Q: If you could elaborate on the new proposals (on Regulation S-K) that SEC Chair Paul Atkins has put forward?

A: It's part of a larger campaign to essentially disassemble capitalism, to remove the capital from capitalism. That the capital is held by the shareholders, and what they're saying ‍to shareholders is, ""you have no more rights. You have no right to ask a company for any disclosure, any material disclosure."" ... It gives companies access to the public markets, but without any responsibility, so companies can act like a private company.

Q: Isn't this in line with executive complaints that there's too much oversight from investors, that everyone will be better off if you let the CEOs (act) and the investors can choose who to back or not?

A: If you have no information, you're not going to know who to back. You're not going to know who ⁠are the riskiest companies. The SEC is basically going back to pre-1934, they're saying that we no longer are here to defend shareholders, we're here to defend corporations. They're inviting a calamitous collapse. The U.S. companies that follow this are going to ‍box themselves out of international markets, like Europe.

A: There are companies that will say, ""we don't have to address risk."" Those are the companies that I believe will be underweighted.

Q: Would you like to see pushback from the big investor community on this regulation?

A: I think ‌that the big ‌asset managers should be outraged at the idea that they are going to be excluded from disclosure. They seem pretty cowed at the moment.

Q: Could it be that this is all for show on the U.S. side, but because of the EU regulations requiring this, most companies will just continue to do this kind of disclosure anyway?

A: I believe most will. Similarly, with no-action (a new SEC policy announced in November), we've actually had the fewest no-actions (steps by companies) at this time of year that we've ever had. It (takes) less resources to have a conversation with shareholders than to get sued because (managers) left a resolution off our proxy. So they're just putting everything on.

A: The companies are actually becoming maybe slightly more open to new ideas, just because ⁠they don't want to have it out in public. Because ⁠there's just so many trolls that are just attacking all ​kinds of crazy stuff.

A: Most companies will have a dialogue. There are those where you have to escalate by filing a resolution, about half of those then say, ""OK, if you withdraw it, we'll take some action."" Then there are the really resistant ones, about 25% or so, that you have to go to a vote.

Q: Is that 25% steady?

A: That's about steady. We've been filing fewer resolutions in the last couple of years.

Q: Where does climate activism go from here?A: You just don't call it climate, you call it supply-chain risk. You ‍have to figure out where your raw materials are coming from.

Q: Do you expect to get much support for these resolutions, given the investment landscape?

A: Here's the thing, these are nonbinding resolutions. We've had some of our biggest wins at 6% (support), we've had some of our biggest losses at 80%. We want to bring forth new ideas.

Q: It's clear the Trump administration's appointees do not have much enthusiasm for the role of shareholder resolutions. Will they succeed in marginalizing the role of resolutions?

A: What the administration seems to want is no oversight. They're trying to take away the ​property rights of shareholders. When you buy a share of stock, you have property rights. You have the right to decide who's on the ‍board. You have the right to ask for material disclosures. If they take away your property rights, I think that sends a signal that they're not going to respect any of your property rights.

A: So I think people should start to be really cautious about their real estate. Will they be allowed ​to build a house on a piece of property that they bought? It's a slippery slope when you start taking away people's property rights, and I think there's going to be major pushback.

HOW FORTUNE DETERMINES THE MOST ADMIRED COMPANIES

Fortune’s list is based on a survey conducted with Korn Ferry. Starting with about 1,500 candidates, the list was narrowed to 685 top-revenue companies across 31 countries.

To determine the best-regarded companies, Korn Ferry asked executives, directors and analysts to rate companies within their industry on nine criteria, including management quality, product quality, social responsibility and talent attraction. A company’s score must rank in the top half of its industry survey to be listed.

To select the top 50, Korn Ferry asked senior executives, directors and industry analysts to select the 10 companies they admired most and rank each one on various attributes. They chose from a list made up of the companies that ranked in the top 25% in last year’s surveys; ranked in the top 3 within their industry the previous year (top 4 for non-U.S. companies); or a company that ranked among the top 50 All-Stars last year and did not make any of the above cuts. Anyone could vote for any company in any industry.",https://news.delta.com/sites/default/files/styles/twitter_share_1200/public/2024-01/20231213_delta_frontline_01-0179_j.jpg?itok=f8KFaEXF,N,,2026-01-21 10:59:12.219075

Last year the EU mandated that 2% of jet fuel made available at its airports needed to be SAF, a requirement that will rise to 6% in 2030 and 20% in 2035.

""All the airline companies are fighting the 6% SAF mandate, which frankly is easy to reach...I will make a bet today that what happened to the car regulation will happen to the SAF regulation in Europe,"" Pouyanne said at a World Economic Forum panel on clean fuels.

TotalEnergies produces SAF at several refineries with plans to expand, but has delayed investments to increase capacity after finding that its clients were not willing to buy more than what was needed to satisfy EU rules, he said.

SAF is three to four times more expensive than jet fuel refined from oil.

Airline companies have blamed their lack of uptake on insufficient volumes being produced, which Pouyanne rejected.

""Today I am facing customers, my airline companies in Europe, who are making a huge lobby (effort) accusing us of not investing enough, which is completely wrong,"" Pouyanne said. ""I will be able to provide 10% of SAF to the airline companies in Europe by 2030, but...everybody is dreaming they can have these biofuels at the same price as (jet fuel made from) oil, but it's not true.""

The CEO added that he was likely to lower investments in low-carbon fuels due to regulatory uncertainty.

""I'm afraid, as it's a regulated market, if they move the targets, then I will have invested in biorefineries for nothing,"" he said.

The agreement covers the entire production volume from Syzygy’s flagship biogas-to-SAF project, with first deliveries targeted in 2028. It also includes an option for Trafigura to purchase additional volumes from Syzygy’s future projects.

Innovative Light-Driven Technology

Syzygy’s technology converts biogas into SAF using renewable electricity through an innovative light-driven chemical reactor process. The pathway has received ISCC pre-certification to produce Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO) and Advanced BioSAF compliant fuels, offering a scalable solution to meet expanding SAF mandates in Europe, the United Kingdom and other markets.

This agreement demonstrates Trafigura’s approach to advancing emerging low-carbon technologies through market-based solutions.

Jason Breslaw, Head of Low Carbon Fuels Business Development at Trafigura, commented: “By providing commercial certainty through long-term offtake commitments, Trafigura can enable innovative companies like Syzygy to secure project financing and scale production. This offtake agreement complements our strategy to support the industry’s efforts to diversify SAF supply, particularly as regulations increasingly mandate the use of advanced fuels. Trafigura’s global low-carbon fuels network positions us to help aviation customers meet these requirements efficiently and cost effectively.”

World’s First Electrified Biogas-to-SAF Facility

Syzygy’s first commercial-scale project, named NovaSAF-1, will be located in Durazno, Uruguay and will be the world’s first electrified biogas-to-SAF facility producing RFNBO-compliant SAF. It will leverage biogas from the Estancias Del Lago powdered milk plant and Uruguayan renewable electricity to produce synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) SAF with 90% lower lifecycle emissions than fossil jet fuel.

Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics, said: “This agreement marks a critical step in our journey toward commercial-scale impact and disrupting the SAF market. With a signed offtake agreement from a global leader like Trafigura, and after having successfully completed FEED engineering in December, we’re now ready to secure financing for the construction of NovaSAF-1 and move our technology from potential into production.”

Strengthening Low-Carbon Fuels Supply Chain

The agreement further strengthens Trafigura’s presence across the entire low-carbon fuels supply chain, from feedstock sourcing through subsidiaries such as Greenlife in Australia, to blending and distribution capabilities via Impala Terminals and Greenergy, and into-wing supply to aviation customers globally.",https://tankterminals.com/wp-content/themes/tankterminals/src/img/favicon/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-21 11:00:02.340759

As a result of these risks, environmental claims and participation in standard-setting initiatives require robust competition compliance safeguards.

Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2024 laying down harmonised rules on Artificial Intelligence.","Energy access as a specific area of focus

In its Study, the FCA focused on the energy and environmental footprint of AI, highlighting access to electricity and land as potential barriers to entry on this market. The FCA points to:

grid congestion and length of grid connection delays (up to 5-7 years), especially in congested areas;

preferential energy supply agreements secured by large digital players;

excessive reservation of electricity or land capacity, potentially foreclosing access to these inputs for competitors; and

risks of discriminatory long-term supply contracts (the Power Purchase Agreements or PPA) by incumbent energy suppliers.

According to the FCA, these practices are liable to produce foreclosure effects and raise prices to the detriment of other market participants. This places data centre siting strategies, long-term PPAs and grid capacity reservations within the scope of potential competition scrutiny.

Environmental performance and standardisation

The FCA identifies ‘frugal AI’ (i.e. minimisation of the environmental impact and resource consumption of AI) as a new parameter of competition, capable of fostering innovation and entry. At the same time, it warns against:

unsubstantiated environmental claims relating to frugal AI (‘greenwashing’);

refusals to disclose environmental footprint data, in particular by dominant players or through parallel behaviour, which may hinder the emergence of frugality as a parameter of competition by preventing customers from assessing and comparing AI solutions on environmental performance; and

anti-competitive conduct within standardisation processes – the FCA supports the development of national, European and international standards to measure AI’s environmental footprint, noting potential pro-competitive benefits such as transparency and comparability.

As a result of these risks, environmental claims and participation in standard-setting initiatives require robust competition compliance safeguards.

AI: A growing priority for public authorities

Generative AI has rapidly emerged as a key policy priority worldwide, prompting public authorities to balance innovation, economic competitiveness and risk mitigation. In France, this has led to an early and sustained policy effort, starting with the national AI strategy launched in 2018 and followed, in March 2024, by 25 recommendations from the AI Commission launched by the French Prime Minister, notably aimed at strengthening computing capacity, improving access to data and contributing to global AI governance.

At the European and international levels, this momentum has translated into an increasingly dense regulatory landscape. The EU AI Act (1), which will largely be applicable from 2026, introduces new obligations for providers of large generative AI models, alongside broader digital regulations such as the Data Act (2). Other initiatives such as the UK Bletchley Declaration and international events, for example the February 2025 AI Action Summit in France, reflect the strategic importance which public authorities now attach to AI.

What it means for you

The FCA’s Opinion and Study underline that competition authorities are ready to intervene early to prevent lock-in effects and the reinforcement of barriers to entry in the AI sector, even in the absence of formal dominance findings. Access to key inputs – computing power, cloud infrastructure, data, energy and talent – is already under active scrutiny (you can view our November 2024 briefing on this related topic here).

As a result, competition law must be embedded in the structuring of AI-related deals, including partnerships, cloud agreements, minority investments and vertical integrations. It should also be factored into market entry and growth strategies, as enforcement is likely to combine ex ante digital regulation with traditional antitrust tools.

The purchase marks a milestone for the industrial software company, which joined the First Movers Coalition Aviation group with a target to replace at least 5 per cent of its conventional jet fuel demand with sustainable aviation fuel. By securing the certificates now, AVEVA has effectively met that commitment well in advance of its original 2030 timeframe.

The certificates were purchased from British Airways for use at London Heathrow Airport. British Airways has a multi-year agreement with renewable fuels producer EcoCeres to supply sustainable aviation fuel, supporting its aim to power 10 per cent of flights with SAF by 2030 and reduce lifecycle emissions from aviation.

EcoCeres produces sustainable aviation fuel, hydrotreated vegetable oil and renewable naphtha at industrial scale. The company is also an AVEVA customer, using AVEVA software to optimise SAF production, creating a link between AVEVA’s digital solutions and its climate commitments.

AVEVA said the purchase demonstrates how market-based mechanisms can be used to accelerate decarbonisation in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation. Sustainable aviation fuel certificates allow organisations to support the production and use of lower-carbon fuels, even where direct access to SAF is limited.

The move builds on AVEVA’s wider sustainability strategy. The company reports it has already reduced its Scope 1 and Scope 2 operational emissions by more than 93 per cent and is on track to reduce Scope 3 emissions by 50 per cent by 2030.

In addition to the SAF certificate purchase, AVEVA also took part in the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance COP30 procurement initiative. Through this programme, the company reduced the climate impact associated with flights linked to COP30, further supporting demand for lower-carbon aviation fuels.

Caspar Herzberg, Chief Executive Officer of AVEVA, said the purchase underlined the need for action alongside ambition.

“The role of tech and industry in driving decarbonisation has never been clearer,” he said. “By investing in sustainable fuels today, we are demonstrating how climate ambition must be matched by concrete action. Through concerted action like this, industries can scale new technologies, minimise lifecycle emissions, and set a higher standard for responsible growth.”

The First Movers Coalition was launched by the World Economic Forum to bring together companies committed to creating early demand for low-carbon technologies in sectors that are critical to achieving net zero. Aviation is one of several focus areas, alongside shipping, steel, cement and chemicals.

Noam Boussidan, Programme Head for the First Movers Coalition at the World Economic Forum, said AVEVA’s early action showed the role companies can play in supporting cleaner aviation.

“It is great to see First Movers Coalition members in action today,” he said. “By purchasing SAF as part of its sustainability roadmap, AVEVA continues to show leadership and make meaningful progress toward the fulfillment of its FMC aviation target. Partnerships like these demonstrate how First Movers Coalition members are supporting the development and use of cleaner aviation technology while driving corporate climate action.”

Sustainable aviation fuel is seen as one of the most viable near-term options for reducing emissions from flying, as it can be used in existing aircraft with minimal modification and offers lower lifecycle emissions than conventional jet fuel. However, supply remains limited and costs are higher, making early corporate demand a key driver for scaling production.

AVEVA said its approach combines internal emissions reductions with targeted investments that help accelerate change across value chains. The company positions its digital solutions as an enabler for industries seeking to measure, manage and reduce emissions, particularly in energy-intensive and complex systems.

By completing its first SAF certificate purchase well ahead of schedule, AVEVA joins a small group of companies that have already begun to operationalise First Movers Coalition aviation commitments. The company said it intends to continue working through partnerships and procurement initiatives to support the broader transition to lower-carbon aviation and industrial systems.",https://sustainablebusinessmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Aveva.png,N,,2026-01-21 11:00:18.997094

Vienna Airport (VIE) achieved the strongest cargo performance in its history in 2025, handling a record 313,763 tonnes of air freight. This represents growth of 5.3% compared with 2024 and underlines the airport’s importance as a logistics hub for Central and Eastern Europe.

Key drivers included the expansion of long haul services, which added additional belly hold capacity, as well as strong growth in e-commerce and pharmaceuticals. The Vienna Pharma Handling Centre also set a new all-time high, increasing volumes by 6.4% compared with the previous year.

“A strong cargo sector is a key success factor for airports. Air freight secures global supply chains and promotes economic growth. Vienna Airport plays a central role in this context—as a logistics hub and as the most important gateway for air cargo to Central and Eastern Europe. With global airlines at the location, a specialised service offering and a strong team, we are very well positioned,” said Julian Jäger, joint CEO and COO of Vienna Airport.

Michael Zach, Senior Vice President Ground Handling and Cargo Operations, added: “In air cargo, all processes must interlock seamlessly to ensure that shipments are handled efficiently and quickly at all times. Behind this record result is a strong team performance, with service quality for our customers as the top priority. Traditionally a leading transhipment hub for goods from Asia, the Vienna Cargo Hub benefited particularly in 2025 from growing volumes to North America. In 2026, we naturally aim to build on this positive development and are confident that we can achieve this together with our customers and partners.”

Imports reached 167,568 tonnes, up 2.8% compared with 2024, driven by e-commerce growth from Asia. Exports totalled 146,195 tonnes, increasing by 8.4% over the previous year, with Asia and the United States as key markets.

Vienna Airport’s strategic location, 24/7 operational readiness, ten Category F aircraft stands and integration with Europe’s road feeder network contribute to efficient cargo handling.

Led by Graz University of Technology (TU Graz), the EU-backed ToFuel project is developing a biorefinery model that converts leftover tomato plant material into cleaner fuel for aviation. The aim is to create a process that produces no waste, reduces emissions, and remains cost-effective, supporting efforts to cut the aviation sector’s reliance on fossil fuels.

Tomatoes are the world’s second most consumed vegetable after potatoes. The European Union is the third-largest producer, harvesting about 17 million tonnes each year. However, tomato farming and processing generate large volumes of waste, including leaves, stems, flowers, peels, seeds and tomatoes that fail to meet quality standards.

At present, much of this material is burned or discarded at significant cost. At the same time, Europe’s target of climate neutrality depends heavily on the availability of clean and affordable aviation fuels made from renewable sources.

To turn tomato waste into usable fuel, the biomass must first be treated so that microorganisms can process it efficiently. The ToFuel project is examining two advanced processing methods.

In the first method, known as extrusion, the biomass is exposed to heat and pressure and then rapidly released, breaking it down into smaller components. This prepares the material for fermentation, during which microorganisms produce oils that can later be converted into aviation fuel.

The second method involves using high pressure and high temperatures to transform the biomass into bio-oil and biochar. Before the bio-oil can be refined into aviation fuel, it must be cleaned to remove unwanted substances that could affect fuel quality.

These processing and cleaning techniques are being developed jointly by Graz University of Technology, the National Laboratory of Energy and Geology (LNEG) in Lisbon, and the University of Zagreb, working together to advance the project.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-1.png,N,,2026-01-21 07:56:57.072294

“Oliver Wyman is a leading global aviation consultancy with extensive and relevant experience in the sector,” Van Oord and Rintel stated.
Oliver Wyman will also assess the costs and benefits of any potential additional measures.
Alongside executive teams of Schiphol and KLM, the final report will be shared with the Dutch parliament and government, which majority owns Amsterdam Airport Schiphol.","Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and KLM have jointly appointed management consultancy firm Oliver Wyman to conduct an independent review of the operational disruptions caused by severe winter weather at the airport in early January.

The objective of the review is to draw lessons from how Schiphol and KLM responded to the disruption and to identify where improvements can be made in the future. “The aim of the evaluation is to determine where improvements are possible in order to strengthen both the operation and the passenger experience,” said Schiphol President & CEO Pieter van Oord and KLM CEO Marjan Rintel in a joint statement.

During the first week of January, Schiphol was hit by what the airport described as “extreme winter weather”, which had a major impact on operations. Prolonged snowfall, freezing rain, low temperatures and strong winds led to thousands of flight cancellations and delays. As a result, large numbers of passengers were stranded, with some forced to spend the night at the airport.

As the largest airline operating at Schiphol, KLM was particularly affected with thousands of cancellations. Additionally, KLM is also a key operational partner of Schiphol in several areas, including aircraft de-icing.

The scale of the disruption drew criticism towards both Schiphol and KLM, especially as the airport appeared to be more severely affected than other European airports facing similar weather conditions. Passengers complained about insufficient communication and support. KLM meanwhile came under additional scrutiny after media reports revealed that the airline had to take emergency measures to avoid a shortage of de-icing fluid.

With the evaluation – initiated in part following political pressure – Schiphol and KLM aim to gain a clear understanding of what may have gone wrong and where opportunities for improvement exist.

“Schiphol and KLM have chosen to conduct the evaluation jointly, given the strong interdependencies between their processes and the importance of an integrated approach,” Van Oord and Rintel said. “The review will assess how these processes performed under winter weather conditions and identify any areas requiring improvement or further attention.”

Oliver Wyman

Schiphol and KLM have engaged Oliver Wyman to carry out the evaluation. The findings and recommendations are expected to be delivered by the end of March. “Oliver Wyman is a leading global aviation consultancy with extensive and relevant experience in the sector,” Van Oord and Rintel stated.

The choice of Oliver Wyman was also influenced by its prior experience with similar reviews, including an evaluation following the severe weather disruptions at Southwest Airlines and Denver International Airport in late 2022. That incident resulted in the cancellation of approximately 17,000 flights and left more than two million passengers stranded.

Scope of the review

The scope of the evaluation includes an analysis of runway availability and utilisation, aircraft de-icing capacity, cooperation between air traffic control, airlines and ground handling companies, passenger communication, and airport safety during the disruption period.

Oliver Wyman will also assess the costs and benefits of any potential additional measures.

Under the leadership of Graz University of Technology (TU Graz), the EU project ToFuel is developing a new biorefinery concept that will convert tomato residues into sustainable aviation fuel.

The research team is aiming for a waste-free and climate-neutral process that is also economically competitive and thus makes an important contribution to the defossilisation of air transport.

Tomatoes are the second most consumed vegetable in the world after potatoes.

The EU is the third largest producer with around 17 megatonnes of tomatoes harvested.

However, tomato production produces large quantities of residual biomass – plant material such as flowers, leaves and stems, peel, seeds and tomatoes of inadequate quality.

Most of these residues are incinerated as agricultural waste or disposed of at high cost.

At the same time, the goal of European climate neutrality and the associated reduction of CO₂ emissions in the aviation sector is largely dependent on the production of competitive and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) from renewable raw materials.

In order to turn tomato waste into a high-quality fuel, the biomass must first be processed so that microorganisms can utilise it efficiently.

ToFuel is investigating two modern fractionation technologies. During extrusion, the biomass is treated under heat and pressure and then broken down into its cellular components by an abrupt drop in pressure.

This creates an optimally digested biomass for the subsequent fermentation process, in which microorganisms produce lipids that are later processed into aviation fuel.

In the second fractionation technology, hydrothermal liquefaction, the biomass is converted into bio-oil and biochar under high pressure and at high temperatures. Before the extracted bio-oil can be refined into aviation fuel, it must be purified of mainly nitrogen-containing interfering ions.

These unwanted ions would otherwise have a negative impact on the subsequent conversion into a sustainable aviation fuel. The corresponding fractionation, biotechnological and purification processes are being developed by the Laboratório Nacional de Energia e Geologia (LNEG) in Lisbon, TU Graz and the University of Zagreb in close cooperation.",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-research-looks-pic-Biofuel-21-1-141926711-768x512.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 03:57:18.517871

According to a recent study by Global Market Insights Inc., the global North America oil based biofuel market was estimated at USD 20.5 billion in 2025. The market is expected to grow from USD 22.5 billion in 2026 to USD 49.4 billion in 2035, at a CAGR of 9.1%.

Stable, multi-year federal volume standards under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) sustain demand for oil based biofuels. Consistent standards assists planning for feedstock procurement (e.g., waste oils and animal fats), optimize refinery co-processing decisions, and justify investments in pretreatment capacity.

The nested nature of the standards enables renewable diesel and biodiesel to backfill broader advanced fuel targets, supporting utilization. While the rule is technology neutral, it has been accompanied by ongoing compliance and implementation updates, signaling program continuity and oversight.

For instance, EPA’s final RFS rule sets volumes for 2023 - 2025, including biomass based diesel (3.04 in 2024; 3.35 in 2025), and affirms program stability via notices and annual standards tables updated through late 2025. This in turn is augmenting the industry landscape across the region.

California, the LCFS remains a primary driver for deploying pretreatment, feedstock diversification, and SAF upgrade units, while encouraging long term supply contracts tied to CI performance. In addition, LCFS continues to increase down carbon intensity (CI) targets, directly improving the credit economics for low CI fuels like hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) renewable diesel and SAF derived from waste fats and used cooking oil.

The 2024 board action to update LCFS, followed by the 2025 resubmittal and approval process, signals the state’s commitment to deeper CI cuts and expanded credit generation opportunities (including end use and infrastructure provisions). These technical revisions, with final rulemaking milestones posted and program pages reflect tightened targets and implementation update.

Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR) deepen regional demand for low carbon diesel and co-processing. CFR requires primary suppliers to reduce the life cycle CI of gasoline and diesel, creating tradable credits across three compliance categories, including the supply of low-carbon-intensity fuels such as biodiesel and renewable diesel.

With reporting commencing and credit market data released, oil-based biofuels have a clearer compliance role in meeting reduction trajectories. Ongoing targeted amendments announced in 2025 aim to strengthen resiliency and support sector development without diluting the program’s emissions focus.

For instance, in June 2024, Environment and Climate Change Canada published Credit Market Report and, in late 2025, issued a discussion paper outlining targeted CFR amendments to bolster Canada’s low-carbon fuel sector. In addition, for cross border producers, CFR credits and provincial programs expand the addressable market for renewable diesel and SAF blends across Western and Eastern Canada.

Furthermore, the U.S. clean fuel production tax credit under Section 45Z represents a meaningful shift in how oil-based biofuels are valued at the federal level. Unlike earlier volume-based incentives, the credit is tied directly to lifecycle emissions performance, encouraging producers to minimize carbon intensity through feedstock choice, energy integration, and process efficiency.

North America Oil Based Biofuel Market Trends

The regional government’s coordinated push to scale sustainable aviation fuel has created new momentum for oil-based biofuel producers with SAF compatible assets. Federal agencies have aligned policy, tracking mechanisms, and funding frameworks to accelerate commercialization while leveraging existing refinery infrastructure.

Oil-based processes offer an advantage due to their readiness for hydro processed esters and fatty acids pathways, which integrate effectively with refinery systems. Public reporting of milestones and capacity development has improved visibility across the aviation value chain, supporting airline offtake engagement and long-term supply planning.

For instance, in May 2025, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Bioenergy Technologies Office took steps to ease constraints on domestic bioenergy development by revising the 45ZCF GREET modeling tool to include new feedstocks and production routes, notably corn wet-milling ethanol and coal-mine methane derived natural gas.

Investments in storage tanks, blending equipment, and dispensing systems increase the availability of biodiesel blends and renewable diesel across retail and fleet locations. Federal grant programs have reduced financial barriers for operators, particularly in rural and multi-state fueling networks.

As infrastructure bottlenecks ease, biofuels can achieve higher throughput and stronger price competitiveness relative to fossil diesel. These developments directly improve demand visibility for producers by strengthening downstream readiness rather than relying solely on mandates.

For instance, in May 2025, the U.S. government updated higher blends infrastructure incentive program to increase significantly the sales and use of higher blends of ethanol and biodiesel by expanding the infrastructure for renewable fuels derived from U.S. agricultural products.

The program is also intended to encourage a more comprehensive approach to market higher blends by sharing the costs related to building out biofuel-related infrastructure. In addition, the region has entered a phase where full scale refinery conversions to renewable diesel are demonstrating operational reliability rather than pilot level feasibility.

Converted sites benefit from existing logistics, hydrogen systems, and marine access, enabling high utilization rates and regional supply security. These facilities reinforce the competitiveness of oil based pathways by achieving industrial scale while maintaining compliance with stringent carbon-intensity programs.

For illustration, in May 2025, Phillips 66 in collaboration with NextEra Energy Resources, commenced commercial operations of the on-site solar facility at the Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex. The facility supports the production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel using waste oils, fats, greases, and vegetable oil feedstocks.

Biofuel producers are investing in pretreatment units, aggregation hubs, and joint ventures that secure access to diverse lipid sources. This integration improves yield consistency, protects catalysts, and lowers operating disruptions. A more resilient feedstock system enhances the competitiveness of oil-based biofuels compared to alternative renewable pathways that rely on less mature supply chains.

North America Oil Based Biofuel Market Analysis

Based on fuel, the market is segmented into biodiesel, HVO, SAF, and others. The biodiesel segment dominated by 54.2% of the market share in 2025 and is set to grow at a CAGR of 8.4% by 2035. State blending mandates and quality standardization sustain all round demand in core markets of the U.S. in recent times.

In addition, industry quality programs and ASTM updates have improved compatibility with modern engines and after-treatment systems, reducing operator concerns over metals content, cold-flow, and injector deposits. This combination of policy enforcement and technical assurance translates into durable local demand that supports rail, truck, and agricultural logistics, and keeps biodiesel competitive against both fossil diesel and paraffinic renewable diesel.

For instance, Minnesota statute and agency guidance continue to enforce the biodiesel content mandate, B20 from April 15 to September 30 and B5 in winter, backed by annual reporting and weights & measures compliance notices. This demand planning for distributors and terminals, ensures throughput for soybean derived methyl esters and other fat and grease-based inputs.

HVO market will grow at a CAGR of 11% by 2035. The region’s renewable diesel landscape is defined by large refinery conversions that have reached sustained, full rate operations. By leveraging existing hydrotreaters, hydrogen systems, and marine/rail access, these complexes process waste oils, animal fats, and vegetable oils into dropping paraffinic diesel with very low carbon intensity.

For instance, Oregon DEQ updated its Clean Fuels Program in 2024–2025, adopting OR GREET 4.0, adding CCS crediting mechanisms, and enhancing verification. For HVO suppliers, better CI performance enhances credit generation and strengthens economics under CI based systems, while structured verification builds market trust.

SAF market will grow a rate of 13% by 2035, propelled by coordinated U.S. federal actions including targeted grants for production and infrastructure, interagency roadmaps, and progress dashboards that quantify capacity and uptake.

This “whole of government” approach reduces uncertainty for airlines and producers, aligns R&D with certification pathways, and highlights the viability of HEFA/HVO based SAF derived from waste lipids. As airports and carriers pursue decarbonization targets, visibility into funding timelines and metrics helps underpin offtake MOUs and project finance.

For instance, in August 2024, The FAA’s Fueling Aviation’s Sustainable Transition (FAST) program awarded over USD 291 million for SAF production, logistics, and low-emission aviation technologies. In addition, DOE/USDA/FAA published the SAF Grand Challenge progress report and implementation framework.

The addition of SAF upgrade trains that convert paraffinic diesel intermediates into jet range products meeting ASTM D7566 annexes will augment the industry growth. This flexibility allows plants to “swing” output between road diesel and SAF based on policy signals and airline demand.

For instance, Valero’s Diamond Green Diesel project at Port Arthur achieved large scale SAF capability in Q4 2024, allowing up to 50% of renewable diesel output to be upgraded to neat SAF, reinforcing multi-product flexibility for U.S. supply.

Based on application, the industry is segmented into transportation, aviation, & others. The transportation application industry held a market share of 74% in 2025 and will grow at a CAGR of 10% by 2035. Transportation continues to represent the largest application segment for oil based biofuels in North America, driven primarily by heavy duty trucking, municipal fleets, construction equipment, and regional freight operations.

Fleets are increasingly adopting higher blends or neat renewable diesel to meet corporate emissions commitments while preserving vehicle uptime and refueling flexibility, reinforcing transportation’s central role in market demand. In addition, as electrification remains limited for long haul and off road applications, oil based biofuels serve as an immediately deployable decarbonization pathway.

Oil based biofuels are increasingly penetrating marine vessels, locomotives, cargo handling equipment, and port adjacent drayage operations. For instance, the Port of Seattle’s 2024 environment and sustainability report highlighted expanded use of low carbon fuels in maritime and cargo-handling operations as part of its decarbonization roadmap.

Aviation application industry will grow at a CAGR of 15% by 2035 and is the fastest growing application for oil-based biofuels, specifically through sustainable aviation fuel derived from waste oils and fats. Airports have emerged as focal points for SAF deployment, acting as aggregators of demand across multiple airlines.

For instance, the Port of Seattle its goal to supply at least a 10% SAF blend for all flights at SEA Airport by 2028, with ongoing regional planning and infrastructure development documented in its 2024 sustainability reporting.

Furthermore, the expansion of SAF usage in North America is increasingly enabled by coordinated federal funding and certification initiatives addressing production, blending, storage, and transport constraints. Programs administered by the Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Department of Energy focus on bridging the cost and infrastructure gap between conventional jet fuel and SAF.

Federal grants also reduce risk for airports and fuel distributors by supporting site-specific feasibility studies and logistics upgrades. As federal oversight improves traceability and lifecycle accounting, airlines gain greater confidence in SAF supply integrity. This regulatory and financial backing is translating into practical deployment rather than pilot-scale trials.

For reference, in October 2025, the Government of Canada announced the introduction of USD 370 million in time-limited, per-liter incentives for domestic biodiesel and renewable diesel producers, effective from January 2026, with the objective of accelerating Canadian biofuel production capacity.

The U.S. dominated the North America oil based biofuel market with around 93% share in 2025 and generated USD 19.1 billion in revenue. The country’s growth is supported by a combination of federal policy stability and large-scale industrial deployment.

The introduction of performance based federal tax credits has shifted focus toward low carbon, waste based feedstocks and refinery efficiency improvements. The U.S. market is further distinguished by extensive refinery conversions that leverage existing petroleum infrastructure to produce renewable diesel and SAF at world scale.

For instance, In July 2025, the U.S. DOE selected 27 innovators and entrepreneurs for the latest cohorts of its Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Program (LEEP). The selected participants will be embedded across four U.S. national laboratories, collaborating with extensive networks of scientific, technical, and commercial mentors to advance transformational energy technologies, including innovations that support and complement the oil-based biofuel value chain.

Canada oil based biofuel market will grow at a CAGR of 9.3% by 2035. The Clean Fuel Regulations establish mandatory lifecycle carbon-intensity reductions for gasoline and diesel sold in Canada, creating sustained demand for biodiesel and renewable diesel.

Various incentives are designed to improve the cost competitiveness of Canadian biofuel producers relative to U.S. facilities that benefit from federal tax credits and state-level programs. In addition, the country is encouraging capacity utilization, new plant investment, and feedstock aggregation within its borders to promote the product adoption.

For instance, in January 2026, the Government of Canada, in collaboration with the Advanced Biofuels Canada Association, launched the Biofuels Production Incentive, a measure designed to provide immediate support to safeguard domestic biofuel production capacity and reinforce Canada’s energy security.

Mexico oil based biofuel market will grow at a CAGR of 4.5% by 2035. The country represents an emerging market for oil based biofuels, characterized by a cautious and state-led approach. Federal energy transition frameworks increasingly recognize biofuels as part of the decarbonization toolkit for transportation and industry.

Government emphasis on energy sovereignty and fuel affordability is further shaping biofuel adoption, favoring to market growth. Pilot deployments, technical assessments, and refinery trials are laying the groundwork for future scale up, particularly for renewable diesel derived from domestic vegetable oils and waste fats.

For reference, Mexico’s Secretariat of Energy (SENER) affirmed biofuels as part of the national energy transition strategy, including evaluation of biofuel use and co-processing within existing refinery operations. This will progress from pilot centric activity to selective commercial deployment, primarily linked to state owned energy infrastructure.

MARKET DRIVERS

Policy Driven Industrial Decarbonization Accelerates Syngas Adoption

Europe’s aggressive climate regulatory framework is compelling heavy industries to seek transitional energy vectors and syngas has emerged as a viable bridge solution, which is a key factor driving the growth of the European syngas market. The European Union’s Industrial Emissions Directive and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism have pressured sectors such as steel, chemicals, and refining to reduce scope one and scope two emissions significantly. Syngas derived from low carbon feedstocks enables these industries to lower their carbon footprint while maintaining operational continuity. According to the European Environment Agency, emissions from industrial combustion processes totaled approximately 473 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent in 2022, which is indicating the urgency for alternatives. As per the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, Germany has allocated up to 1.2 billion euros through its H2Global initiative to support hydrogen and derivative fuel projects, including syngas-based systems. Furthermore, the EU’s Innovation Fund disbursed billions of euros in 2023 to projects integrating renewable energy with carbon management, with several syngas conversion units qualifying for support. These policy instruments not only incentivize investment but also establish stringent lifecycle emission thresholds which favor gasification technologies with integrated carbon capture over conventional fossil routes, thereby reshaping demand toward cleaner syngas configurations.

Expansion of Waste to Energy Infrastructure Fuels Syngas Feedstock Diversification

The growing municipal solid waste burden of Europe has catalysed the development of advanced thermal conversion facilities that utilize non-recyclable waste as syngas feedstock, which is further propelling the growth of the European syngas market. According to Eurostat, 511 kg of municipal waste per capita was generated in the EU in 2023, amounting to over 225 million tonnes in total, and landfilling rates still exceed 11% in several member states. Countries such as France, Italy, and Poland are commissioning gasification plants that convert refuse-derived fuel into syngas for combined heat and power or chemical synthesis. As per the Confederation of European Waste to Energy Plants, more than 530 waste-to-energy facilities operated in Europe in 2024, with gasification and pyrolysis units representing a growing share of new installations. The European Commission’s Circular Economy Action Plan explicitly endorses thermochemical conversion as a recovery option for non-recyclable fractions, thereby legitimizing syngas generation from residual streams. According to Avfall Sverige, Sweden recovers nearly 99% of household waste, with a significant portion processed through thermal methods. This waste valorisation trend not only alleviates disposal pressures but also provides a locally sourced feedstock that circumvents natural gas price volatility and enhances supply chain resilience for syngas producers.

MARKET RESTRAINTS

High Capital Intensity of Advanced Gasification Technologies Inhibits Widespread Deployment

The transition from conventional steam methane reforming to low carbon syngas production methods such as biomass gasification or waste-derived plasma gasification demands substantial upfront investment, which constrains market scalability. Installing an integrated biomass-to-syngas facility with carbon capture capabilities typically requires capital expenditures ranging from €400 to €600 million, according to estimates published in peer-reviewed techno-economic assessments. Such costs are prohibitive for mid-scale industrial players, particularly in Southern and Eastern Europe where access to green financing remains limited. Even with EU funding mechanisms like the Innovation Fund, project developers face prolonged approval cycles and stringent technical validation requirements. As per the European Investment Bank, only 23% of submitted clean energy infrastructure proposals in 2023 secured full financing due to perceived technology and offtake risks. Moreover, the absence of standardized modular gasification units increases engineering complexity and site-specific customization, further inflating costs. This financial barrier delays the replication of successful pilot projects such as the GoBiGas initiative in Sweden, which despite technical success, struggled with economic viability. Consequently, many industrial consumers continue relying on imported hydrogen or conventional natural gas reforming despite higher long-term carbon compliance costs simply because capital constraints outweigh decarbonization incentives.

Feedstock Supply Chain Fragmentation Undermines Operational Consistency

The viability of non-fossil syngas routes in Europe is heavily contingent on reliable and standardized feedstock streams, yet the current supply landscape remains highly fragmented across regions, which is further impeding the growth of the European syngas market. For instance, Biomass residues exhibit significant seasonal and geographic variability in availability and composition. According to the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, the technical potential of available lignocellulosic residues across the EU is estimated at 220 million tonnes per year, but only 55% is considered economically recoverable due to collection logistics and competing uses. Similarly, the quality of municipal solid waste-derived feedstock fluctuates widely between urban centers and rural zones, affecting gasifier efficiency and syngas composition. As per a 2024 study by the Technical Research Centre of Finland, moisture content and calorific value of refuse-derived fuel can vary by up to 40% between neighbouring waste processing plants, which is undermining stable syngas output. Without harmonized feedstock specifications and coordinated regional collection networks, operators face frequent process interruptions and catalyst degradation. The European Committee for Standardization has initiated work on EN standards for alternative feedstocks, but implementation remains inconsistent. This uncertainty discourages long-term offtake agreements and deters investors seeking predictable plant performance, thereby constraining the market’s ability to scale beyond isolated demonstration sites.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

Integration with Green Hydrogen Ecosystems Opens New Value Streams

Syngas infrastructure is increasingly positioned as a complementary enabler within Europe’s expanding green hydrogen economy, particularly through co-processing and retrofit pathways, which is a notable opportunity in the European syngas market. Existing syngas units, especially those based on autothermal reforming, can be adapted to co-feed biogas or green hydrogen, thereby reducing net carbon intensity without complete rebuilds. According to the Hydrogen Council, a significant share of announced low carbon hydrogen projects in Europe as of 2024 incorporate hybrid feedstock strategies where syngas platforms serve as transitional assets. In the Netherlands, the VoltaChem program has demonstrated that blending green hydrogen into conventional syngas streams enhances hydrogen yield while maintaining ammonia synthesis compatibility, as verified by TNO, the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Researchvoltachem.com. Furthermore, surplus renewable electricity can be utilized in power-to-syngas configurations where electrolytic hydrogen reacts with captured carbon dioxide to produce tailored syngas mixtures. The European Commission’s IPCEI Hy2Tech framework has approved cross-border projects in Belgium and Germany that integrate such pathways with carbon utilization. This synergy not only extends the operational relevance of existing industrial gas infrastructure but also creates dual revenue models through hydrogen and chemical co-production by aligning syngas assets with the EU’s 2030 renewable hydrogen targets.

Emergence of Synthetic Sustainable Aviation Fuel Mandates Creates Premium Demand

Europe’s ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation mandates that 2% of aviation fuel must be synthetic and low carbon by 2030 and is catalyzing demand for Fischer-Tropsch-derived fuels produced from syngas, which is another major opportunity in the European syngas market. Unlike bioethanol or hydrotreated esters, synthetic paraffinic kerosene from syngas offers superior energy density and full drop-in compatibility with existing jet engines. According to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, the EU’s commercial aviation sector consumed approximately 46 million tonnes of jet fuel in 2023. Companies such as Sasol and Fulcrum BioEnergy are advancing waste-to-syngas-to-jet fuel projects in France and Spain, leveraging municipal solid waste as feedstock. As per the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, meeting the 2030 target will require at least 2.8 million tonnes of synthetic fuel annually. Additionally, the EU Emissions Trading System’s inclusion of aviation since 2024 increases the carbon cost of conventional jet fuel, thereby improving the economic case for syngas-based alternatives. With airlines such as Lufthansa and Air France having already signed offtake agreements for synthetic kerosene, this regulatory-driven demand shift is transforming syngas from an industrial intermediate into a strategic mobility fuel component.

MARKET CHALLENGES

Intermittency of Renewable Energy Sources Complicates Power to Syngas Economics

Although power-to-syngas systems offer a promising route to carbon-neutral fuel production, their operational efficiency is heavily undermined by the intermittent nature of Europe’s wind and solar generation. Syngas synthesis via co-electrolysis or reverse water-gas shift requires stable thermal and electrical inputs, yet grid availability fluctuates significantly across regions and seasons. According to ENTSO-E, renewable generation curtailment in the EU reached 14.8 terawatt-hours in 2023, primarily due to grid congestion and inflexible demand profiles. While this surplus could theoretically power syngas units, actual plant utilization rates remain low, with some studies reporting figures below 35%. Low-capacity factors inflate the levelized cost of syngas, making it economically uncompetitive against fossil-based alternatives even with carbon pricing. Additionally, frequent start-stop cycles degrade high-temperature electrolyzer stacks and catalyst beds, which is increasing maintenance costs and downtime. Without dedicated renewable microgrids or long-duration storage integration, syngas facilities cannot achieve the steady-state operation required for chemical synthesis. This intermittency challenge is particularly acute in Northern Europe, where wind resources are abundant but grid reinforcement lags behind deployment targets, thereby constraining the scalability of renewable-driven syngas despite its environmental merits.

Lack of Harmonized Carbon Accounting Methodologies Creates Market Uncertainty

The absence of a universally accepted methodology for quantifying the carbon intensity of syngas across its lifecycle impedes market access and investor confidence in Europe, which is further challenging the expansion of the European syngas market. Current frameworks such as the EU Renewable Energy Directive II and the upcoming CBAM apply divergent calculation rules for biogenic carbon, waste-derived feedstocks, and co-product allocation. According to a 2024 analysis by the International Council on Clean Transportation, carbon intensity values for identical syngas pathways can vary significantly depending on the accounting model applied. This discrepancy complicates compliance with fuel standards like ReFuelEU and discourages cross-border trade in syngas-based products. Moreover, the European Commission’s Product Environmental Footprint initiative has yet to finalize category rules for synthetic gases, which is leaving project developers without clear guidance. In Germany, for example, two syngas plants using similar municipal waste feedstocks received different sustainability classifications from regional auditors, leading to unequal access to subsidies as reported by the German Biomass Research Centre. Such regulatory fragmentation increases administrative burden and creates an uneven playing field, particularly for small and medium enterprises lacking dedicated compliance teams. Until the EU establishes a unified and transparent carbon accounting protocol for gaseous energy carriers, syngas producers will face persistent uncertainty in market positioning and eligibility for green financing.

But in an accelerated climate-changing world, these three vital ingredients are under threat from drought, pollution, conflict, resource shortages, and inequity — and that threat is felt most keenly by people living in low-income settings and nations.

This is why City University of Hong Kong (CityUHK) launched its 10-year, UNESCO-endorsed Fostering Innovation for Resilience and Sustainable Transformation (FIRST) initiative, with the goal to deliver affordable and sustainable technologies to improve standards of living for communities.

Keeping cool

For people in wealthy countries, dealing with hot weather can be as simple as turning on the air conditioning. But that’s not only expensive; it is unsustainable in a world where such technologies still largely run on fossil fuel-generated electricity.

Looking for simple, low-cost, low-energy solutions, researcher Edwin Tso drew inspiration from the Saharan silver ant (Cataglyphis bombycina), whose body is coated with highly reflective hairs that reflect radiation and offload excess heat through thermal radiation. Tso and colleagues have developed a coating for buildings that does the same thing: reflects sunlight to reduce heat absorption and also emits infrared radiation so efficiently that it can reduce surface temperatures by as much as 30°C.

The coating is sustainably made, using local waste materials such as seashells, ceramic debris, rice husks, construction sand, and crushed glass. These materials are cleaned and ground up into nano-sized particles, which are then mixed with a specially formulated binding agent. The resulting coating can then be painted or sprayed onto rooftops and walls.

Sun power

A research team led by Alex Jen and Angus Yip has developed a much more cost-efficient alternative, which is based on solar photovoltaic technology using easy-to-make metalhalide-based perovskites instead of silicon. These materials are not only relatively cheap but can be thinner and more flexible than conventional solar cells. Perovskite-based solar cells are also becoming much more efficient at converting solar energy into electricity, even in less-than-ideal conditions such as low-light or high-temperature settings.

Human activity generates vast amounts of waste daily, from single-use plastics to spoiled food and agricultural biomass. Addressing this issue is a defining challenge of our era. But what if we could eliminate waste, cleanse the environment, and generate energy simultaneously?

Researchers Charles Xu and Carol Lin believe this is achievable through innovative biorefinery processes. This includes processes to transform plastic and organic waste into valuable products like biochar for fertilizer, bio-hydroponic foams for soilless planting, and sustainable aviation fuel. Also, Lin is developing a method to convert industrial organic waste into biosurfactants as cleaning agents and personal care products.

These scalable, adaptable systems can be configured modularly to handle diverse waste streams — from industrial food waste to agricultural or marine debris. The initiative plans to trial this technology in underserved areas like urban slums, remote towns, and fishing communities, where waste is abundant but management is scarce.

The first step involves identifying local waste types and determining useful outputs for the community. Ultimately, the end products will offer value-added outputs, which leads to a cleaner environment and sustainable energy supply.

Around 1.7 billion people worldwide don’t have access to safe drinking water, which contributes to a substantial burden of water-borne diseases such as cholera and typhoid. Part of the problem is that purifying drinking water needs a reliable power supply.

Zhiguo Yuan’s team has developed a solution that uses people-power to drive an ultraviolet (UV) light disinfection system that can sterilise 10 litres of water in just 15 minutes.

The triboelectric-electromagnetic hybrid generator can be operated by pedal or hand-cranked. It is extremely efficient, converting nearly 90% of the human power into electricity to drive the UV disinfection system. The system is also very easy to operate, and it only takes a few minutes to train someone to use.

The programme will initially focus on areas affected by natural disasters, where the risk of water-borne disease is much higher.

According to the Department of Energy, Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, is a type of aviation fuel produced with renewable biomass and other waste resources that can offer aviation-grade performance without the need for petroleum, thereby reducing the associated greenhouse gas emissions with flight from the Aspen/Pitkin County Airport.
The feasibility study, which was approved by the Pitkin County Commissioners in July 2024, sought to assess whether the feedstock for such fuels existed in quantities to make local SAF production possible.

Accumulating the fuels and the water to do it would be huge.” Currently, the Aspen/Pitkin County Airport uses 20% SAF in their fuel mixture without the local production element.","A feasibility study into Sustainable Aviation Fuel production in the Roaring Fork Valley by Pitkin County and other local governments reached the conclusion that, while there is plentiful ‘feedstock’ for the manufacture of such fuel locally, the logistical challenges of extracting and producing SAF would be too large for a government to take the lead on.

Those partners included Pitkin County, Mesa County, Eagle County, Delta County, various regional airports in the area including Aspen/Pitkin County Regional Airport and Grand Junction Regional Airport, Atlantic Aviation, and more.

According to the Department of Energy, Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, is a type of aviation fuel produced with renewable biomass and other waste resources that can offer aviation-grade performance without the need for petroleum, thereby reducing the associated greenhouse gas emissions with flight from the Aspen/Pitkin County Airport.

The feasibility study, which was approved by the Pitkin County Commissioners in July 2024, sought to assess whether the feedstock for such fuels existed in quantities to make local SAF production possible. According to the study, the fuel exists locally in the form of “woody biomass” that would be extracted from beetle-killed pine trees, municipal solid waste like compost and other organic waste, and the potential growth of “oilseed” crops like camelia, soybean, and canola plants.

However, each local feedstock comes with its own challenges, according to the study, which was published in the Board of County Commissioner’s documents for Tuesday’s meeting.

But beetlekill pine would be expensive and difficult to extract due to their dispersed nature in state and national forests with competing and different interests in lumber extraction. Municipal Solid Waste does not exist in quantities in the Roaring Fork Valley to support SAF production locally and, while organic waste can be pooled from other waste centers from outside the valley, the dispersed nature of that approach would likely drive the cost of production outside of the realm of possibility.

And oilseed crops, while compatible with the Roaring Fork Valley’s agricultural history and production, could not be grown in sufficient quantities locally to produce SAF using only locally grown crops.

“We would not be able to fully support a (SAF plant) using only local oilseed crops,” Pitkin County Climate Action Analyst Michael Port told commissioners on Tuesday. “We would need to import large amounts of material to actually produce SAF at scale. We were originally looking at if we could fully support this just with local material.”

Additionally, commissioners mentioned a concern around the water-usage of SAF-production in a valley long-known for its water scarcity.

“Perhaps this just is not the climate and the area where we should be trying to produce fuel,” Commissioner Greg Poschman commented. “It’s a water intensive thing. This would be like saying ‘maybe we should put a big AI facility out here somewhere or chip plant in Western Colorado because we’ve got so much silicon,’ but the thing is that there are other elements involved. Accumulating the fuels and the water to do it would be huge.”

Currently, the Aspen/Pitkin County Airport uses 20% SAF in their fuel mixture without the local production element. Ultimately, commissioners and staff agreed that the conclusion of the study was that SAF is not currently commercially viable for the local governments involved in the feasibility study to undertake.

Pitkin County’s presentation did leave open the possibility that private industry could overcome some of the challenges of SAF-production, and noted that local governments and other partners in this study could support that effort.

“This group didn’t want to be project developers, but our role as local government could be to create an environment that is more suitable for private investors through the mechanisms that we have available,” Port said. “We did not find a business case today for building a SAF plant, given current technology. But this is still a relatively young market, and things might change in the coming years.”",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/5/2026/01/09002721/EDLplane-atd-010826-01-1024x819.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 23:57:18.601720

“We are a water state, not an oil state, but a water state,” Hansen said, noting that nitrate contamination and aging wastewater systems affect communities of all sizes.
Despite disagreements, panelists repeatedly emphasized the need for bipartisan cooperation as lawmakers head into a short session and an election year.","MANKATO, Minn. — Minnesota lawmakers from both parties told farmers that the 2026 legislative session will test whether the state can balance environmental regulation, infrastructure investment and economic survival during one of the toughest farm economies in years.

During a packed afternoon listening session at the Minnesota Ag Expo on Jan. 20, 2026, inside the Mayo Clinic Health System Event Center, legislators and Minnesota Agriculture Commissioner Thom Petersen outlined priorities ranging from sustainable aviation fuel and beginning farmer loans to water infrastructure and regulatory reform — while also revealing sharp divisions over how state agencies interact with agriculture.

Petersen said his focus remains on ""getting things done” in a narrowly divided Legislature.

“Most of the years that I’ve been commissioner, we’ve been able to work with everybody on the stage to pass bipartisan bills,” Petersen said. “You’ve got to find a way, at the end of the day, to get things done.”

A top priority for Petersen and lawmakers on both sides is replenishing the Rural Finance Authority, which provides low-interest loans to farmers. The governor’s bonding proposal includes $50 million for RFA, but Petersen warned the fund could run dry in the coming year.

“If we don’t put more money into there, we’ll run out of money by the end of next year,” he said. “So we wouldn’t have money to loan out to farmers.

Sen. Torrey Westrom, R-Alexandria, urged lawmakers to pass RFA funding early and separately from a broader bonding bill.

“The more you bunch these bills together, you’ve just got too much weight on the wagon you’re pulling,” Westrom said.

Beyond financing, the most heated exchanges centered on regulation, and particularly the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and proposed feedlot rules.

Westrom said he recently spoke with a cattle producer who “spent $200,000 fighting the MPCA so he can pasture his cattle and raise cattle.”

“That is ludicrous,” Westrom said. “We’ve got to get that MPCA off the backs of farmers.”

Sen. Aric Putnam, DFL-St. Cloud, pushed back on characterizations of regulators, arguing that lasting solutions require engagement rather than confrontation.

“The agency is not a thing. It’s a group of people,” Putnam said. “When you engage with them as people, they can listen, they can respond.”

Putnam said lawmakers must focus on “solving problems rather than flying a partisan flag.”

Rep. Rick Hansen, DFL-South St. Paul, said agriculture cannot be separated from broader social and environmental challenges, particularly water quality.

“We are a water state, not an oil state, but a water state,” Hansen said, noting that nitrate contamination and aging wastewater systems affect communities of all sizes. “Everybody needs clean water.”

Hansen has proposed alternative funding mechanisms, including fees, to help pay for infrastructure that small communities cannot afford on their own.

During the session, a question from MPCA employee and fourth-generation dairy farmer Addison Fraze underscored the tension between regulation and practicality.

“How do we walk that line?” Fraze asked, referring to protecting water resources while allowing farms to remain viable.

In a follow-up interview, Fraze said polarization has made progress difficult.

“If you’re too pro regulation, or if you’re too against regulation, then you’re not getting anything done,” he said. “Asking those hard questions is what needs to happen for us to find the middle.

Rep. Paul Anderson, R-Starbuck, said farmers are feeling squeezed from all sides, including by new labor mandates such as paid family leave.

“The bill we had last year would exempt farmers if they were had four or fewer employees from the paid family leave,” Anderson said in a follow-up interview. “It didn’t go anywhere.”

The program went into effect Jan. 1, and Anderson said it has added paperwork and costs for farms already operating on thin margins.

“It’s additionally a lot of work,” he said. “It’s a big deal.”

Anderson also addressed concerns about the state’s grain indemnity fund, which is getting its limit tested following the Hansen-Mueller Co. bankruptcy.

“Thankfully, this won’t get to that impact,” Anderson said, noting current claims are expected to stay well below the threshold that would trigger new farmer assessments.

Despite disagreements, panelists repeatedly emphasized the need for bipartisan cooperation as lawmakers head into a short session and an election year.

The FAA is alerting operators about safety issues that can arise from the rapid growth of space launch operations in the U.S.

As space launches become more frequent, the agency’s guidance underscores that the safe integration of space and traditional air traffic operations hinges on collaboration, careful pre-flight planning and in-flight awareness among pilots and operators, and real-time responsiveness.

SAFO 26001 focuses on the airspace management challenges that accompany these activities, especially the potential for catastrophic failures that produce debris fields capable of endangering aircraft. The alert encourages operators to proactively consider how launch operations might disrupt planned routes and day-of-operation traffic flows.

Review SAFO 26001 (PDF)

The FAA creates an airspace management plan for each launch, which outlines TFRs, aircraft hazard areas (AHA) and debris response areas (DRA) that may be needed to safeguard air traffic. AHAs and TFRs are typically disseminated through NOTAMs, alerting pilots to areas and altitudes where flights should avoid during launch windows.

SAFO 26001 advises flight planners and crews to integrate space launch considerations into their routine procedures. Pilots also are encouraged to maintain heightened situational awareness around areas where debris may fall and to ensure they carry sufficient fuel reserves to accommodate unexpected changes in routing.

In cases where an anomaly occurs – such as a launch failure – air traffic control may activate a DRA, reroute aircraft away from danger and broadcast alerts to affected flights.

“Some of these pre-published AHA’s affect significant amounts of airspace,” said Dean Snell, senior manager, NBAA Air Traffic Services. “The size of the AHA is usually determined by the predictability of the launch vehicles and boosters. For this reason, launches of prototype and early development vehicles cover more airspace due to the lower predictability of the flight path. We also see more complex AHA’s for the larger launch vehicles such as SpaceX Starship and Blue Origin New Glenn.

“The DRA’s will be noted in advance via NOTAM but will not be officially implemented unless there is a non-nominal event with the launch vehicles or boosters,” Snell added. “Due to the weather and atmospheric requirements for launches, it is somewhat common to see AHA’s cancel at the last minute and be reactivated the subsequent days.”",https://nbaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Blue-Origin-rocket-launch.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 19:56:43.142807

Addressing the Global SAF Feedstock Constraint

The global aviation industry faces a structural constraint in scaling SAF: the limited availability of qualified, low-carbon waste-based feedstocks that can be efficiently processed by existing refinery infrastructure. Many refineries encounter technical and economic challenges when handling high-acidity and impurity-rich waste oils such as palm oil mill effluent (POME) and used cooking oil (UCO), which can degrade conventional catalysts and increase operating costs. UMeWorld’s Malaysia platform is designed to address this constraint by converting difficult-to-process waste lipids into specification-driven renewable fuel intermediates. These intermediates are intended to integrate with existing hydroprocessing and SAF upgrading units, reducing the need for costly refinery modifications and expanding the pool of usable waste-based feedstocks.

Technology-Enabled Commercial Advantage

UMeWorld’s Malaysia platform is built around a technology-enabled conversion process designed to expand the usable universe of waste-based feedstocks for renewable fuel production. Unlike conventional processing approaches that struggle with high-acidity and impurity-rich inputs, the platform is engineered to consistently upgrade challenging waste lipids into renewable fuel intermediates compatible with existing refinery systems. The conversion process is designed to operate under lower-severity conditions than conventional chemical refining approaches, improving feedstock tolerance, reducing degradation risk, and enabling more efficient downstream integration.

This technology advantage delivers tangible commercial benefits for fuel offtakers:

Broader feedstock access: Enables utilization of waste streams typically constrained or excluded by traditional refining processes

Infrastructure compatibility: Produces intermediates designed to integrate with existing hydroprocessing and SAF upgrading units

Improved economics: Supports competitive pricing by reducing feedstock constraints and downstream processing complexity

“The SAF market does not face a demand problem - it faces a feedstock and economics problem,” said Michael Lee, Chief Executive Officer of UMeWorld. “Our Malaysia platform is designed to unlock underutilized waste feedstocks and convert them into intermediates that refineries can actually use, while maintaining disciplined and predictable economics. That combination is essential for SAF to scale sustainably.”

Facility Execution and Timeline

The Malaysia SAF feedstock facility is engineered to meet European Union ReFuelEU Aviation carbon-intensity thresholds and is planned with an initial nameplate capacity of approximately 10,000 metric tonnes per year. The plant architecture emphasizes modularity, enabling future expansion and replication. Key execution milestones include:

Operating entity in place: Verdant Sustainable Fuel Sdn. Bhd. incorporated January 16, 2026

Site selection underway: Final site selection targeted within the next 90 days, prioritizing feedstock density, logistics access, and port connectivity

Construction timeline: Subject to site finalization and permitting progression, initial construction activities expected to commence later in 2026

Strategic Outlook

The Malaysia Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) feedstock initiative is a cornerstone of UMeWorld’s Strategy 2026, which prioritizes the development of scalable, capital-efficient industrial biofuel infrastructure alongside the continued expansion of the Company’s DAGola™ functional nutrition platform. By deploying a consistent and replicable processing platform across both sectors, UMeWorld aims to strengthen operational efficiency, enforce cost discipline, and create durable long-term shareholder value.

This agreement demonstrates Trafigura's approach to advancing emerging low-carbon technologies through market-based solutions.

Jason Breslaw, Head of Low Carbon Fuels Business Development at Trafigura, commented: ""By providing commercial certainty through long-term offtake commitments, Trafigura can enable innovative companies like Syzygy to secure project financing and scale production. This offtake agreement complements our strategy to support the industry's efforts to diversify SAF supply, particularly as regulations increasingly mandate the use of advanced fuels. Trafigura's global low-carbon fuels network positions us to help aviation customers meet these requirements efficiently and cost effectively.""

Syzygy’s first commercial-scale project, named NovaSAF-1, will be located in Durazno, Uruguay and will be the world's first electrified biogas-to-SAF facility producing RFNBO-compliant SAF. It will leverage biogas from the Estancias Del Lago powdered milk plant and Uruguayan renewable electricity to produce synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) SAF with 90% lower lifecycle emissions than fossil jet fuel.

“This agreement marks a critical step in our journey toward commercial-scale impact and disrupting the SAF market,” said Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics. “With a signed offtake agreement from a global leader like Trafigura, and after having successfully completed FEED engineering in December, we’re now ready to secure financing for the construction of NovaSAF-1 and move our technology from potential into production.”

The agreement further strengthens Trafigura’s presence across the entire low-carbon fuels supply chain, from feedstock sourcing through subsidiaries such as Greenlife in Australia, to blending and distribution capabilities via Impala Terminals and Greenergy, and into-wing supply to aviation customers globally.

Canola, used in some countries for the production of biofuels, raises food-security concerns and, above all, scale: yields per hectare are low and the area required to replace aviation fuel would exceed the size of Australia.
Ongoing research focuses on improving the biomass of the plants, so as to increase the proportion that can be converted into fuel without reducing yields.
If the commercial production of sustainable aviation fuel becomes a reality — something the researchers believe is within reach — international adoption could be rapid.
In this scenario, sugarcane could place Australia at the forefront of the energy transition in the aviation sector.","An Australian researcher argues that sugarcane could play a decisive role in the future of sustainable aviation fuel, by enabling the substitution of fossil-origin carbon without compromising food production or biodiversity.

The position comes from Professor Emeritus Robert Henry of the University of Queensland, who is part of the ARC Research Hub for Engineering Plants to Replace Fossil Carbon, a research center that brings together universities and international companies with the aim of developing renewable fuels viable at the scale of the aviation industry.

According to the researcher, plants are currently the best available source of renewable carbon, and among all the options analyzed, sugarcane stands out for its productivity and ability to be produced at large scale. “It is the only agricultural crop that is already produced in the volumes necessary to meet the demands of this sector,” he notes.

Other alternatives have been studied, but present significant limitations. Algae, for example, are frequently pointed to as promising, but the high costs make them uncompetitive without the existence of high-value byproducts. Canola, used in some countries for the production of biofuels, raises food-security concerns and, above all, scale: yields per hectare are low and the area required to replace aviation fuel would exceed the size of Australia.

The use of land is, therefore, a critical factor. Sugarcane combines high productivity with a relatively small land footprint, which makes it particularly attractive. Ongoing research focuses on improving the biomass of the plants, so as to increase the proportion that can be converted into fuel without reducing yields.

To accelerate this process, scientists are using a phased strategy: they start by testing genetic alterations in simpler crops, such as rice, then move on to sorghum — a close relative of sugarcane — before applying the most promising solutions to sugarcane itself, whose genetics are more complex.

Australia, and in particular the state of Queensland, emerges as a privileged territory to lead this transition. The country has a consolidated sugar industry, strong scientific capacity, and international partnerships. Moreover, the high level of air travel creates a strong domestic demand for sustainable fuels.

“The challenge is complex, but the potential is enormous,” says Robert Henry. If the commercial production of sustainable aviation fuel becomes a reality — something the researchers believe is within reach — international adoption could be rapid. In this scenario, sugarcane could place Australia at the forefront of the energy transition in the aviation sector.",https://www.plusnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sugarcane-Identified-as-a-Key-Solution-for-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 17:56:46.751163

Additional initiatives outlined in Avianca’s 2024 sustainability report further supported emissions reductions.
Through its Avianca Fuel program, the airline implemented 24 fuel-saving initiatives in 2024 aimed at reducing fuel burn across its network.
Beyond flight operations, Avianca focused on reducing emissions from ground activities and infrastructure.
According to the sustainability report, Avianca’s emissions strategy also includes compliance with international market-based measures.","Colombian flag carrier Avianca reduced its total carbon emissions by 5.1% between 2019 and 2024, despite an 18.1% increase in overall capacity, according to data from EmeraldSky. Over the same period, the airline cut its carbon intensity by nearly 20%, lowering emissions from 82.6 to 66.3 grams of CO₂ per available seat-kilometer.

The emissions reductions stem largely from fleet modernization. Since 2019, Avianca has retired nearly two-thirds of its Airbus A319 aircraft, phased out its entire A321 fleet, and exited regional jet and turboprop operations. These aircraft were replaced with a larger number of Airbus A320neo jets, which deliver approximately 20% fuel savings compared with previous-generation models, along with additional A320ceo aircraft. On long-haul routes, the airline replaced Airbus A330 aircraft with Boeing 787s, which offer lower fuel consumption per seat. As a result, the average aircraft size in Avianca’s fleet increased from 144 seats in 2019 to 181 seats in 2024.

Avianca also reconfigured cabins across both its narrowbody and widebody fleets to improve seating density and fuel efficiency. Although global supply chain constraints pushed the average fleet age to about 9.5 years, the airline reconfigured 24 aircraft in 2024 alone, bringing the total number of optimized aircraft in operation to 141. These reconfigurations reduced emissions per revenue passenger-kilometer by 15.35% compared with non-reconfigured aircraft.

Additional initiatives outlined in Avianca’s 2024 sustainability report further supported emissions reductions. Through its Avianca Fuel program, the airline implemented 24 fuel-saving initiatives in 2024 aimed at reducing fuel burn across its network. These included expanded use of single-engine taxi operations, with compliance rates reaching 84.38% in Bogota, 98.76% in Quito and 77.17% in El Salvador. The airline also introduced new decision-support tools for dispatchers to improve fuel planning and coordinated fuel-reduction strategies with flight standards, operations engineering and maintenance teams.

Operational efficiency programs targeting pilots and flight dispatchers also contributed to emissions cuts. In 2024, the initiative involved 1,926 pilots and 128 dispatchers and used incentives to encourage the application of manufacturer-approved fuel efficiency practices within strict safety parameters. Top-performing pilots were recognized quarterly, alongside additional incentives to reinforce adoption. Together, these actions helped avoid 64,520 tons of CO₂ emissions in 2024, including 62,042 tons from passenger operations and 2,480 tons from cargo activities.

Beyond flight operations, Avianca focused on reducing emissions from ground activities and infrastructure. In 2024, the airline added 14 electric vehicles for maintenance operations in Bogota and Rionegro, replacing combustion vehicles and reducing emissions by up to 80% per vehicle. At its Rionegro maintenance facilities, Avianca also promoted bicycle use for internal transportation, logging 1,449 trips that avoided an estimated 2,006 kilograms of CO₂. Infrastructure investments included the generation of 816,896 kilowatt-hours of solar energy in 2024, supplying 34% of the electricity consumed at the Rionegro facility. Cargo warehouses in Rionegro and Miami operate with energy-efficient lighting systems and refrigeration technology with zero ozone depletion potential.

According to the sustainability report, Avianca’s emissions strategy also includes compliance with international market-based measures. The airline reported emissions from international flights under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) for seven operating airlines within the group, with each report verified by an accredited independent body in accordance with ICAO standards. In parallel, Avianca prepared for the European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, which takes effect in 2025 and requires airlines to monitor fuel use, comply with anti-tankering rules and progressively increase the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). During 2024, the airline strengthened fuel-consumption monitoring at European airports, automated reporting processes and secured agreements with SAF suppliers to meet regulatory requirements on routes from Europe.

SAF remains a central pillar of Avianca’s long-term decarbonization strategy, although the airline acknowledges significant technological, regulatory and financial barriers to large-scale deployment in Latin America. In 2023 and 2024, Avianca participated in technical working groups led by Colombia’s civil aviation authority to develop a national SAF roadmap under the “Cielos limpios: Aviación para la vida” initiative. If approved, the roadmap would position Colombia as the third country in the region, after Chile and Brazil, to adopt a formal SAF strategy. Avianca is also engaging with fuel suppliers, government agencies, universities and industry partners to explore Colombia’s potential as a SAF producer and exporter, while evaluating mechanisms such as Book and Claim to support early adoption.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2026-01/pexels-felipe-rocha-2293861-15616195.jpg?h=32973ddf&itok=beK6UJDx,N,,2026-01-20 15:57:03.243653

“About 40% of our corn exports go to Mexico, and about 40% of our ethanol exports go to Canada,” Swanson said.
“So collectively thinking about corn and ethanol, important markets.
And these were already important markets before USMCA, but they have grown in importance and market share since then.","NASHVILLE, TENN. (RFD NEWS) — Farmers across the country are looking for ways to market a glut of corn right now and tackle business planning for the growing season ahead. The Nebraska Farm Bureau (NEFB) President, Mark McHargue tells RFD NEWS he is in talks with officials across the pond to capitalize on demand for U.S. ethanol.

“In Nebraska, we do have a carbon pipeline now that’s functioning and running,” McHargue explains. “All of our ethanol plants are major ethanol plants. Can produce ethanol at a very, very low carbon score, and that’s important primarily to our export markets. I had a conversation with leadership from the UK while I was at the [AFBF] Convention. They’re still very excited about potentially buying SAF [Sustainable Aviation Fuel] from this country, upping their ethanol usage, and they certainly still want that low-carbon fuel.”

Next door in Iowa, Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig tells RFD NEWS grain producers in his state are also hoping to see ethanol come to the rescue. Naig told RFD NEWS that year-round sales of E15 would be the ideal market for many growers in his state.

“I know they want to get this done, and the wheels of Congress just broadly have been so slowly grinding,” Naig said in a recent interview with RFD NEWS. “We need to move some things that are important. Look, timing’s everything. Let’s use this most recent crop report as maybe the final signal that we need to push this thing through, because it actually can have a dramatic impact, both for the farm community — and look, in Iowa, where Iowa consumers are saving $40,000,000 a year, just last year, in using E15 versus 10% ethanol blend.”

U.S. Auto Makers Push Back on Flex-Fuel Vehicle (FFVs) Production

Regular gasoline blends contain up to 10 percent ethanol, E15 uses 15 percent, and so on. On the other hand, FFVs can use ethanol blends up to 85 percent. While higher ethanol blends are available, most vehicles produced and sold in the U.S. cannot run on them. Markets analyst Chris Swift told RFD NEWS that U.S. manufacturers need to start adapting before it is too late.

“We really need our automobile manufacturers to be able to increase that engine or be able to warranty it to be able to handle that higher [blend],” Swift explains. “And we noticed that when we got into the flex fuel a couple of years ago, most of those vehicles now can’t be found anywhere. So, we really need the help of the automotive manufacturers to be able to increase that engine performance with that higher ethanol production.”

General Motors faced a class-action lawsuit in 2022 over those vehicles, with users claiming that the high-ethanol blend damaged their engines. That case was dismissed, but other parts of the suit are still working their way through the courts. However, the issue is not a matter of developing the technology. These FFVs are already produced by Chinese manufacturers like BYD and sold globally. However, Chinese EVs and FFVs are extremely rare in the United States due to steep tariffs, national security restrictions on connected vehicle tech, and a lack of established dealerships, making direct import complex and costly.

Expanding Domestic Ethanol Production

The ethanol industry is expected to expand this year. Broker Sherman Newlin tells RFD NEWS that when everything comes online, it could be positive news for corn growers.

“We’re supposed to be building out about another billion gallons worth of production, just plants expanding because of our tax credits that are available out there. And everybody’s trying to grind as much as they can. So, if all that could come online within the next year or so, or maybe a little bit longer than that, I mean, another billion gallons of ethanol produced could use up to another 300 million bushels of corn.”

Brazil’s ethanol industry is also expanding this year. Newlin says the South American trade giant currently operates about two dozen plants right now and could expand to as many as 40 within the next few years.

Corn Groups Push for Input Cost Reductions and USMCA

As farmers plan for the upcoming growing season, many are monitoring geopolitical factors and potential impacts on input and commodity prices. Lewis Williamson with HTS Commodities joined us on Tuesday’s Market Day Report to provide his market outlook.

In his interview with RFD NEWS, Williamson discussed what he is watching in today’s market during the first weeks of the year. He also shared his outlook for the upcoming growing season and the factors he anticipates influencing planting decisions and market conditions.

As row crop farmers prepare for spring planting, economists at the nation’s largest corn group, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), say it will be important to watch geopolitical developments, especially regarding fertilizer.

“It’s a relatively big chunk of the operating costs,” explains NCGA Chief Economist Krista Swanson in a recent interview with RFD NEWS. “It usually makes up about 35% of operating costs. And, you know, it’s kind of the most volatile of the input costs. And so even some small swings and fertilizer prices can have big implications for farm profitability, which is a big deal when we are in this profitability string that we’re in right now, where costs have been higher than prices the last few years.”

Fertilizer prices are a mixed bag lately. Analysts at DTN found that five of the eight major types had become more expensive recently, while DAP and MAP both fell by less than 10 percent. All eight types are more expensive than this time last year, with UAN 32 up 27 percent year over year.

NGCA is also paying close attention to recent comments on the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the trade pact that President Trump called “irrelevant.” Swanson says they will be pushing to keep that agreement in place.

“About 40% of our corn exports go to Mexico, and about 40% of our ethanol exports go to Canada,” Swanson said. “So collectively thinking about corn and ethanol, important markets. And these were already important markets before USMCA, but they have grown in importance and market share since then. So, I think that speaks to the testament of the importance of this.”

USMCA is set for review this summer, but recent comments from President Trump are now calling that into question. In addition to calling it “irrelevant,” he claims that Canada gets more out of the agreement than America does. If the review is not successful this summer, the trade pact could sunset in 2036.",https://rfdtv.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/acb1770/2147483647/strip/true/crop/720x404+0+1/resize/730x410!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jwplayer.com%2Fv2%2Fmedia%2FePfeCg6T%2Fthumbnails%2FP55Z0G7r.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 14:57:16.788693

The trend marks a renewed threat to affordability after the pandemic jacked up ticket prices.

A peer-reviewed study by researchers at the University of Sydney found that the additional cost to long-haul flight from using sustainable aviation fuel ranges for $68 to “hundreds of dollars” per ticket.

The average traveller, meanwhile, is willing to contribute a mere $2.60 extra toward sustainable fuel for a long-haul flight.

While households baulk at costlier travel, governments in Europe are implementing decarbonisation mandates that will force airlines to adopt sustainable fuels, even though the scarcity of the low-emissions fuel will create an added cost for the industry.

Sustainable airline fuel, a lower-emission alternative derived from sources like used cooking oil and green waste, is essential for decarbonising air travel but is currently three to six times more expensive than conventional jet fuel.

“Australian and New Zealand travellers like the idea of sustainability, but they are not willing to foot the bill for [sustainable fuel],” said Rico Merkert, professor of transportation at the University of Sydney.

“If government and industry don’t collaborate, I think flying will become more expensive,” he warned.

The expected price pressure comes as the aviation industry is still recovering from COVID-19 lockdowns, which decimated airline skilled staffing, crippled supply chains and pushed up airfares.

According to an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission report from December 2025, domestic airfares had already reached their highest levels in years due to “strong demand … which puts upward pressure on airfares.”

Yet government fuel mandates are advancing, even as the capacity for the industry to produce the fuel remains deeply constrained.

The EU requires a mix of sustainable fuel to be blended with traditional fuel, starting at 2 per cent in 2025, rising to 6 per cent in 2030, 34 per cent in 2040, and 70 per cent by 2050, according to Sydney-based NoviqTech, which creates software to track emissions.

The UK requires 2 per cent in 2025 and 10 per cent by 2030.

Australia has no binding sustainable fuel blend mandate and no large-scale production facilities, although it is considering incentives to spur the industry.

Industry group Airlines for Australia and New Zealand CEO Stephen Beckett said the aviation sector wants to lower environmental impact and is aware of the risk for consumers.

“If you simply jack up the price of jet fuel, on top of all the other fees and charges being levied on airfares, the cost of doing business is going to go up,” he said.

“We need to make sure aviation remains affordable for all Australians.

“We want to decarbonise and need to get the policy architecture right, so the demand and supply-side policy work together, and not against each other.”

Despite the rapid growth of electric cars, battery or hydrogen-powered aircraft are not likely to make a significant contribution to reducing emissions from planes before 2050, according to industry group A4ANZ, making sustainable fuel crucial despite its cost.

SAF comprised only an estimated 0.6 per cent of total jet fuel consumption in 2025, the International Air Transportation Association said in December.

It is on track to rise to 0.8 per cent this year.

At current price levels, the cost of SAF translated into an additional US$3.6 billion ($5.4 billion) in global fuel costs for airlines last year. Airlines spent $US236 billion on fuel last year.

In December, IATA’s director general, Willie Walsh, said: “If the goal of sustainable fuel mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park [succeeded wildly].

“But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonisation of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work,” he said.

The University of Sydney researchers queried 1001 consumers on what they were willing to pay for a more “green” flight, and found that SAF was “a very hard sell”.

“SAF did not resonate with most travellers,” the researchers said.",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8825%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/7723e45081858127d684361d90b75a08a4197f9b,N,,2026-01-20 13:56:49.185823

In particular, future work should explore how such behavioral models can be embedded within broader governance frameworks.","Designing and implementing actions for decarbonization necessitates a comprehensive understanding of human behavior. While technological advancements are essential, they alone cannot resolve the multifaceted challenges of eliminating greenhouse gas emissions. Behavioral change is also necessary, and achieving it requires the use of targeted interventions or behavior change strategies that address individual and contextual factors influencing decision-making. Effective decarbonization strategies must integrate behavioral insights pertaining to multiple actors, including individuals/households, businesses, and government organizations — all of whom experience uncertainty in their decision-making. Behavioral choices significantly influence final consumer demand, mobility patterns, energy choices, and the adoption and use of new technologies. For instance, promoting sustainable mobility behaviors requires not only the availability of ecofriendly transportation options but also the willingness of individuals to adopt and use these options. Understanding these behavioral aspects is critical for designing climate policies that are technically sound, socially acceptable, and balance the dual objectives of achieving zero carbon emissions while enhancing well-being and happiness.

Our workshop participants, authors of this paper, who include experts in transportation and energy research and have disciplinary backgrounds in engineering, economics, econometrics, environmental psychology, applied math and data collection, identified a range of strategies influencing climate mitigation actions, including technology development, policy and regulation, information and education, compensation and redistribution of the costs and benefits, as well as strategies that account for key aspects of behavior. One such aspect is behavioral heterogeneity. Individuals have different beliefs, preferences, needs, and constraints that will affect their responses to emissions mitigation measures. Other overarching behavioral factors include willingness to pay and public acceptance, and the role of emotions and seemingly “irrational” responses.

Designing decarbonization policies presents several significant challenges. The objective of achieving zero carbon emissions requires substantial changes in energy production, consumption, and overall societal behavior. Simultaneously, policies must account for adverse impacts on well-being and happiness, ensuring that transitions to low-carbon systems do not adversely affect quality of life, which is also important to secure public support. Additionally, minimizing the costs of new technologies and energy is crucial to make decarbonization economically viable and politically acceptable. Furthermore, forecasting and assessing the impact of individual and combined climate change mitigation actions is complicated by deep uncertainty. This uncertainty arises from various sources, including unpredictable technological advancements, variable economic conditions, complex human behavior and contextual factors, and uncertainties about how the climate system will develop. Deep uncertainty makes it challenging to predict long-term outcomes and to design robust policies that remain effective under a wide range of future scenarios. Therefore, policymakers must adopt flexible, adaptive approaches and continuously update their strategies based on new information and insights1,2.

This complexity is illustrated in Fig. 1, which is presented in two panels. In both panels, the x-axis represents the degree of decarbonization. The top panel shows the corresponding mitigation costs, while the bottom panel shows the associated level of well-being. In both cases, the shaded areas around the curves represent the uncertainty in the estimation of these indicators. Two examples are highlighted: integrated land-use planning (e.g., ref. 3), which achieves a relatively low degree of decarbonization at low cost while enhancing well-being, and electric vehicles (e.g., ref. 4), which contribute to a higher degree of decarbonization but at higher costs and with smaller well-being gains.

While the figure is conceptual, its form is grounded in empirical and theoretical evidence on the cost-effectiveness and complexity of transport decarbonization measures. The steep initial rise in decarbonization effectiveness at low cost reflects well-documented findings from integrated land-use and transport planning, which can deliver substantial emission reductions alongside co-benefits such as improved public health, equity, and accessibility, often at relatively modest investment levels5. Similarly, investment in high-quality cycling infrastructure can increase cycling rates by 60–90% with moderate spending, reinforcing the steep early gains depicted6.

As costs increase toward more capital-intensive measures, the curve flattens, consistent with marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves in energy-system studies7. These curves typically result from ranking mitigation measures by cost-effectiveness, beginning with the lowest-cost options and progressing to those with higher unit costs. In the transport sector, this pattern reflects the greater technical, institutional, and behavioral challenges of deeper decarbonization, such as shifting entire vehicle fleets to zero-emission technologies or overhauling infrastructure networks.

We propose a methodological framework to help policymakers deal with uncertainty; design policies and regulations; understand public responses; and forecast the impact of policies and technologies on behavior, while identifying effective strategies for communicating these impacts to stakeholders.

The framework includes surveys of human behavior, choice models of technology and policy adoption, choice of energy sources, and consumption behavior. Bundles of decarbonization measures can then be evaluated using agent-based simulations where behavioral models predict the reactions by different stakeholders and the consequent reduction in emissions. We focus on decarbonization of the transport sector for the remainder of this paper; however, the framework we employ is applicable to other sectors as well.

While the framework is designed to support evidence-based policy design by anticipating behavioral responses and emissions outcomes, we recognize that decarbonization is ultimately embedded in broader societal and institutional contexts. Structural factors such as infrastructure provision, planning decisions, market dynamics, and regulatory environments shape both behavioral possibilities and technological pathways. Furthermore, the distributional impacts of climate policies and the processes through which they are designed raise important questions of justice, equity, and political legitimacy. Although these issues are not explicitly modeled within our framework, they can be partially addressed through the evaluation of distributional outcomes8 and the design of compensatory or reinvestment mechanisms. The framework is thus best understood as a decision-support tool that can inform policy within a wider governance process — one that must also account for questions of voice, representation, and institutional power.

Behavioral heterogeneity

The extent to which people engage in pro-environmental behavior varies, depending on individuals’ capacities and motivation to engage in the behavior18,19,20. Behavioral heterogeneity thus depends on contextual factors, differences in personal ability to act, and the motivation to act. Contextual factors include available infrastructure, technology, market design, price regimes, and regulations (we elaborate on these below). For example, individuals are more likely to drive an electric car if they have access to a fast and reliable charging infrastructure and when electric cars are affordable (e.g., via subsidies), and people can only use public transport when convenient public transport is available.

Differences in personal ability to act are another factor leading to behavioral heterogeneity. Perceived ability depends on personal characteristics such as education level, knowledge, income, and family situation. For example, perceived ability to act pro-environmentally will be higher when people have better knowledge of the causes and consequences of environmental problems, and understand how to mitigate these problems19. Income is also a key variable explaining behavioral heterogeneity. There is empirical evidence21 that lower-income groups in the USA consistently prioritize environmental protection over economic growth. Higher-income groups may also feel more able to act pro-environmentally22, particularly when such actions are financially costly. Indeed, many options, such as investments in home insulation or PV19, or adoption of electric vehicles23, are more accessible to higher-income individuals. Further, the family context can restrain some behaviors (e.g., people may need a car to pick up children after work).

The third motivation to act affects behavioral heterogeneity. People consider various costs and benefits of actions, and weigh these consequences differently depending on the values they endorse19. Values reflect general goals that people strive for in their lives, which affect how they weigh different costs and benefits of actions, and which choices they make24,25. Four types of values are particularly important to understand environmental choices: hedonic values (i.e., striving for pleasure, reducing effort), egoistic values (i.e., striving to enhance and secure one’s resources such as money and status), altruistic values (i.e., striving to enhance the well-being of others) and biospheric values (i.e., striving to protect nature and the environment26). In general, people with strong hedonic and egoistic values are less likely to act pro-environmentally, as doing so is oftentimes somewhat costly (e.g., buying an electric vehicle) or less comfortable (e.g, traveling by bus rather than by car). In contrast, stronger altruistic and particularly stronger biospheric values generally promote pro-environmental actions, as such actions benefit nature, the environment, and the well-being of others, including future generations.

People consider a range of individual, collective, social, and emotional costs and benefits when making decisions19,27. First, they are more likely to act pro-environmentally when such actions offer individual benefits at low cost28. Picard et al.29 show that the perceived costs and benefits of driving vary depending on whether individuals commute with their spouse or travel alone. Second, people are more likely to engage in pro-environmental behavior when they are concerned about environmental problems, feel a sense of responsibility to reduce them, and view themselves as supportive of the environment19. Fehr and Gächter30 demonstrate experimentally that many individuals are willing to punish free-riders in public goods games, even when doing so is personally costly and offers no material benefit. Third, social norms, i.e., the expectations and behaviors of others, can significantly influence individual choices. People tend to follow such norms to gain social approval, avoid disapproval, or because they believe it is the right thing to do19. For example, people are more likely to install solar panels when many neighbors already did so31. Fourth, people are more likely to act pro-environmentally when they anticipate that such actions will generate positive emotions, such as a sense of pleasure or moral satisfaction, and may avoid certain behaviors if they expect these to result in negative feelings25,32,33.

Our discussion indicates that many factors affect individual choices and the likelihood that people act pro-environmentally. These factors vary across individuals, explaining the heterogeneity in choice behavior. It is important to understand these different factors and their impacts on individual choices and behaviors, so that policies can be appropriately designed to mitigate climate change. Table 1 summarizes exemplary choices with respect to each of the Kaya identity-based factors that relate to the three components representing behavioral heterogeneity. Integrating these factors and choices into transport models would increase the representation of consumer and producer heterogeneity.

Technology adoption and infrastructure requirements

The introduction of new technologies can bring about challenges, such as increased demand for energy or travel (known as induced demand) and hidden economic, environmental, or social costs that may not be immediately apparent. These factors necessitate careful consideration to prevent unintended consequences.

For instance, while the rapid uptake of EVs is expected to reduce tailpipe emissions and, in most regions, is increasingly supported by growing shares of renewable electricity, the transition still raises important infrastructure and resource concerns. The additional electricity demand from EVs is unlikely to negate their emissions benefits unless it is met with carbon-intensive sources such as coal, which is increasingly rare in many countries34,35. However, a full transition to electrified transport could place significant strain on grid capacity and requires substantial investments in charging infrastructure36. Furthermore, it entails environmental and geopolitical risks linked to the extraction and processing of critical raw materials (e.g., lithium, cobalt, and rare-earth elements), as well as challenges associated with battery manufacturing and end-of-life management. Broader infrastructure considerations are thus essential when implementing decarbonization strategies, as they provide the physical and systemic foundation for supporting sustainable technologies and practices. Table 2 provides an example of propagating infrastructure requirements for each of the three Kaya identity factors.

Another challenge of innovative and sustainable infrastructure projects can be the time to impact, as these projects are influenced by a complex chain involving regulatory approvals, funding allocations, stakeholder consultations, and end-user behavior. For instance, the scalability of EV charging infrastructure hinges on industry partnerships and governmental support to expand access and adoption across diverse geographical regions37.

The uptake of any new technology, and the infrastructure accompanying it, typically begins with early adopters. Compared to early adopters, later adopters attach greater importance to perceived usefulness, affordability, accessibility, and policy incentives38. However, early adopters on their own are seldom enough to make something financially viable. To scale up, funding mechanisms are required, with initiatives ranging from private-public partnerships to support from charities and foundations such as the Solar Impulse Foundation, which advocates for sustainable solutions.

Finally, public willingness to pay for both the additional costs of using infrastructure (marginal costs) and the larger upfront investments (capital expenditures) is essential to ensure that innovative infrastructure projects are financially secure and can sustain themselves over time.

The time it takes for traditional infrastructure to have an impact (“time to impact”) can be shortened if it is designed to address an existing demand for public transportation or to encourage people to shift from using polluting cars to cleaner public transport. This is the case, for example, of the Crossrail project in London, or the Grand Paris Express intended to improve Paris accessibility and attractiveness, and to make the Paris region a polycentric city39,40. However, funding such large infrastructures also raises challenges.

Finally, uncertainties regarding the environmental and societal impacts of infrastructure projects necessitate careful consideration. Issues such as their effects on biodiversity and human communities, alongside local and global perceptions of these impacts, can spark social protests and influence decision-making (see Heathrow’s 3rd runway41,42, or the UK national grid upgrade43, or the local opposition to the Grand Paris Express project in the most productive agricultural lands around Paris44).

Policies, programs, rules, and regulations enacted at all levels of government are obviously designed to influence the behavior of individuals, households, and business establishments as described in the following subsections.

Market-based policies

Market-based environmental policies encourage behavior change (in firms and/or individuals) through market signals by leaving economic agents a choice, as opposed to explicit regulatory directives or ‘command’ and ‘control’ regulation (technology-based or performance-based standards). Broadly, market-based policies include pollution charges and deposit-refund systems (e.g., carbon taxes enacted in European countries in the 1990s), tradable permits and cap-and-trade schemes (e.g., the U.S EPA’s 1986 Clean Air Act, which mandated an emission trading policy for ‘criteria’ pollutants; the EU ETS), subsidies to reduce pollution, and market barrier reductions (removing explicit or implicit barriers to market activity). As such, they can affect all factors forming the Kaya identity.

Although governments at all levels are starting to implement market-based instruments45,46, they have, in general, been slow to do so. A key challenge has been resistance from interest groups and the public for a variety of reasons. There is a legitimate concern that market-based instruments may lead to adverse distributional impacts, exacerbate existing inequalities, and give rise to environmental injustice. This is particularly problematic when the financial burden of such policies—such as carbon pricing or energy taxes—falls disproportionately on vulnerable groups, who often have fewer resources to absorb additional costs or adapt their behavior. These same groups are also frequently the most exposed to environmental risks, making them doubly disadvantaged by both economic and environmental harms. For example, a carbon tax often places a heavier burden on lower-income households, as they spend a larger share of their income on energy and everyday goods affected by the tax, especially before any compensation or revenue redistribution is applied47,48,49.

Market-based tools like carbon pricing and emissions trading have often been introduced too weakly to be effective. In many cases, carbon prices have been too low or pollution limits too loose to drive meaningful change46. Participation has sometimes been limited, and the expected cost savings have not materialized50. These outcomes are partly due to unrealistic assumptions about how people and companies behave, flaws in policy design, and the fact that many companies lack the internal capacity to take full advantage of these systems51.

The effectiveness of market-based policies strongly depends on how individuals and firms respond to price signals, making it especially important to understand and anticipate behavioral reactions, which are often uncertain and context-dependent. At the same time, generating accurate predictions about the likely impacts of the policy is critical in garnering public acceptance and underscores the role of behavioral models. For instance, the Stockholm congestion charging scheme is instructive; initial public skepticism changed after the scheme was introduced, largely due to the evident reduction in congestion52,53, and in environmental problems54.

Suitable approaches to address the dual challenge of anticipating behavioral responses and fostering public support (in the context of both environmental and congestion externalities) include recycling/dividend schemes to address welfare and distributional impacts, the use of behavioral modeling and optimization to design policies that account for likely public reactions, careful framing of policy instruments (for example, users in Stockholm were more receptive when the term “environmental charges” was used instead of “congestion charges”), and information campaigns. More broadly, no single policy instrument is likely to offer a complete panacea toward decarbonization, as no single instrument can address all barriers to change.

Table 3 provides two examples of market-based policy measures and their potential impact on each of the Kaya identity factors. As is visible, the impact of the two policies on travel behavior can lead to opposite directions.

Regulations

Regulations serve as policy tools that force behavioral change to address environmental challenges. They can be categorized into supply-oriented and demand-oriented approaches. Supply-oriented regulations, such as mandates for minimum sustainable aviation fuel mixes (affecting CO2/E in the Kaya identity), directly influence the composition and availability of products in the market by placing rules on the supplier. Demand-oriented regulations are placed on the end-user/consumer. Measures like establishing low-emission zones in urban areas, setting speed limits, or banning the use (rather than the production) of internal combustion engines are examples of policies designed to reduce emissions and improve air quality by prohibiting some types of targeted user behavior.

As with market-based policies, regulations can affect each factor of the Kaya identity. Regulations aiming at fuel specifications affect CO2/E, whereas those aiming at vehicle fuel economy impact E/PTK and PKT. However, in contrast to market-based measures, the lower marginal costs of driving associated with a more fuel-efficient vehicle can result in an increase in vehicle travel and thus traffic congestion, air pollution, and other externalities. For the industrialized world, this rebound effect was estimated to be around 12% in the short run, increasing to 32% in the long run55.

While regulations can be enacted quickly and have immediate legal effect, their environmental impact often unfolds gradually. First, considerable time is needed to build support among stakeholders and reduce public and political resistance. Once passed, the regulation must be aligned with existing legal frameworks and implemented in a way that meets all legislative requirements. Industries may also require a substantial lead-in time to adjust and comply with new standards. For example, if a regulation affects vehicle design, long fleet turnover times must be taken into account, meaning that the full environmental impact of such measures may not be realized for decades (e.g., ref. 56). Furthermore, behavioral adaptation must occur in response to the regulation, which also takes time. While these challenges are often associated with regulatory instruments, they also apply to other policy tools that aim to influence long-term technology choices, such as vehicle adoption, and should be considered when evaluating short-term versus long-term effectiveness. Skipping any of these steps risks undermining a regulation’s durability, early uptake, or overall impact.

Table 4 presents two examples of regulatory policy measures along with their impact on each of the Kaya identity’s factors. As with regulatory measures, depending on the implemented policy, the outcome on travel behavior can be fundamentally different.

Information and education

Providing information and education on the causes and consequences of environmental problems or on ways to reduce these problems generally increases people’s knowledge. However, it often does not encourage pro-environmental actions19, as people typically face other barriers to act as well. Indeed, informational strategies are especially effective when the targeted behavior is not very inconvenient or costly (in terms of money, time, effort, and/or social disapproval), and when individuals do not face important external constraints on behavior18.

Social influence approaches that communicate what other people do or think can encourage mitigation actions, as can social models of desired actions. For example, information on what others do or expect one to do, providing role models, and community approaches that promote behavior change from the bottom up can encourage pro-environmental actions19. Other interventions that utilize the social context are spreading awareness of environmental impacts through social media57, leveraging “social marketplaces” where people encourage each other in myriad ways58, or mobile app-based games to connect with communities59,60,61.

Information and education programs can complement and enhance the impact of regulatory and market-based measures by communicating the need for and the goals of these policies, and fostering understanding of their positive impacts18. For instance, explaining the rationale behind and positive impacts of carbon pricing can enhance public support and compliance with these measures. Hence, by integrating information campaigns with regulatory frameworks and market incentives, policymakers can reinforce the effectiveness of these policies, encouraging broader societal participation and support. Such integrative policies are likely to address multiple barriers to change, thereby catalyzing sustainable behavioral change.

Information and education campaigns can also support the introduction of cleaner technologies. For example, electric vehicles (EVs) illustrate how factors like drivetrain options, costs, and driving range can significantly influence consumer choices62. Awareness campaigns and educational efforts can play an essential role in disseminating information about these parameters, ensuring consumers can make informed decisions63. Additionally, marketing initiatives that highlight options like battery leasing for EVs can help inform consumers about ways to reduce upfront costs, thereby encouraging broader adoption64.

Table 5 presents the example of automobile CO2 emissions labeling and the potential consequences for each of the three Kaya identity factors.

Compensation and redistribution

A ‘just transition’ entails that climate change policies address the inequitable distribution of both the impacts of climate change and the costs and benefits of mitigation efforts. Marginalized and low-income populations — who are least responsible for past greenhouse gas emissions and have benefited the least from carbon-intensive economic development or decarbonization policies (such as subsidies or incentives mostly used by higher-income groups) — are often the most vulnerable to climate impacts and possess the fewest resources to adapt. It is also essential to consider the potential regressive effects of climate policies, particularly market-based instruments like carbon pricing, which can disproportionately burden low-income households and exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities, possibly leading to social protest such as the Yellow Vests crisis studied by Chamorel65. The political economy of a ‘just transition’ is complex. It involves questions of recognition — ensuring that the concerns and identities of all social groups are acknowledged and respected — alongside procedural justice, which relates to fair and inclusive decision-making processes, and distributive justice, which concerns the fair allocation of resources and responsibilities. It also requires attention to distributional outcomes, meaning the actual, measurable impacts of climate policies on income, ethnicity, gender, and other forms of inequality, both within and across countries66,67. For instance, transition-related job losses (for example, from the closure of coal mines, fuel and gas plants) are likely to be concentrated in areas and social groups that already have been affected by deindustrialization and globalization68. Ethnic inequalities arise when large-scale renewable energy infrastructure projects (e.g., hydroelectricity) or forest protection initiatives lead to forcible relocation and the loss of traditional livelihoods67,69.

Addressing distributional justice toward a just transition requires appropriate measures of compensation and redistribution. For instance, in the case of market-based policies such as a carbon tax or a congestion toll, this would involve dedicating or earmarking revenues in ways that benefit ‘losers’ (for example, lump-sum transfers have been adopted for the federal carbon tax in Canada46). Other compensation schemes for climate policies include environmental tax reforms that reduce labor taxation, green deal plans (investments in areas of the green economy that could stimulate job creation), place-based policies (a local targeted version of green deal plans that focuses on spatial inequalities induced by the green transition), and progressive green subsidies (i.e., to remove financial constraints for the poor and accelerate the adoption of green technologies)70. Public support for these policies tends to increase when revenues are used in ways perceived as fair and beneficial—for example, through direct rebates to households, investments in public services, or targeted support for vulnerable groups, rather than across-the-board tax cuts or general budget spending71.

However, there are several challenges associated with direct refunds and compensations. First, it is challenging to determine adequate compensation since it requires quantifying exactly the benefits and losses at the individual level. For this reason, achieving a Pareto improvement (where no individual is worse off) is often considered a near impossibility by economists46. Another challenge is that refunding schemes may create undesirable incentive effects (e.g., users trying to overstate losses) and open the door for strategic behavior that undermines efficiency gains from the policy46. Finally, administrative and transaction costs could be prohibitive, but these can conceivably be minimized through technology.

Empirical evidence further supports the need to target high-income behavioral patterns. For example, private jet emissions from wealthy individuals increased by 46% from 2019 to 2023, totaling 15.6 MtCO2 annually72. More broadly, the wealthiest 10% globally are responsible for 36–45% of total greenhouse gas emissions, with transport-related affluence being a key driver73.

Note that fully addressing the questions of justice and power in the context of transport decarbonization requires a level of theoretical and empirical elaboration that goes beyond the scope of this paper. As noted in the introduction, our focus is on providing a methodological framework to support the design and evaluation of decarbonization policies, particularly by anticipating behavioral responses and assessing distributional outcomes. While we discuss compensation and redistribution mechanisms, a comprehensive integration of structural inequalities, power asymmetries, and procedural justice into the modeling framework would require additional components — such as participatory processes, institutional analysis, and governance modeling — which are not developed here.

Joint effect of policies

When policies are designed in isolation, without considering the presence of other instruments, they may create distortions or even undermine their own objectives. For example, implementing congestion pricing without investing in adequate public transport alternatives may disproportionately penalize certain groups and reduce overall policy effectiveness.

Synergies and trade-offs often arise across sectors. Consider the interaction between transportation and energy systems: road pricing policies designed to manage congestion can influence the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), thereby affecting electricity demand and grid operations. Conversely, dynamic energy pricing alters the relative cost of EV use compared to conventional vehicles, with direct implications for travel demand and mode choice. Designing an optimal joint pricing framework that accounts for both transport and energy sectors can unlock co-benefits such as reduced congestion, smoother demand on the grid, and improved environmental outcomes.

Managing joint effects also requires avoiding contradictions and overlaps. Uncoordinated regulations can create uncertainty, discourage compliance, or impose excessive burdens on stakeholders. Effective coordination across government levels and sectors, combined with early stakeholder engagement, is critical to ensure coherent and credible policy packages.

Revenue recycling is another lever to strengthen complementarities. Using proceeds from carbon pricing or environmental fines to support low-income households, invest in renewable energy, or expand public transport can enhance both fairness and political acceptance74. Similarly, targeted investment in charging infrastructure for underserved peri-urban and rural areas, or in multifamily residences where private charging is limited, can mitigate inequities. Without such targeting, EV subsidies combined with energy demand management policies may disproportionately benefit high-income households who can afford residential battery storage systems, thus widening gaps in energy costs and access.

In summary, addressing the joint effects of policies calls for a holistic approach that explicitly considers cross-sectoral dynamics, distributional impacts, and institutional coordination. Policy mixes are not the exception but the rule: effective decarbonization depends on packages of complementary instruments that balance efficiency, equity, and feasibility. The methodological framework developed in this paper is designed to capture such interactions by quantifying behavioral responses to multiple instruments applied jointly rather than in isolation. By fostering synergies and minimizing conflicts, integrated policy packages can deliver more effective, equitable, and durable pathways toward transport decarbonization.

Public acceptability

The extent to which options are evaluated (un)favorably by the public plays an essential role in the implementability of proposed policy measures. Hence, it is critical to understand which factors affect the acceptability of policies, as this provides important insights into which strategies could be implemented to address public concerns. Four factors appear to affect public acceptability of options: perceived costs and benefits of options, distributive fairness, procedural fairness, and trust in responsible actors.

First, acceptability is higher when people believe options have more positive and fewer negative effects for self, others, or the environment19. Because of this, policies ‘rewarding’ pro-environmental actions are more acceptable than policy ‘punishing’ actions that increase environmental problems. Pro-environmental options and policies are evaluated as more acceptable when people strongly value the well-being of other people and the environment, when they are more concerned about environmental problems, and when they feel more responsible and capable of helping reduce these problems, probably because this increases the likelihood that people recognize and value the environmental benefits of options and policies19. Further, the more people are aware of environmental problems, the more strongly they prefer governmental regulation and behavior change rather than free-market and technological solutions75. Acceptability can increase when people experience that an option or a policy has more positive effects than they expected, which suggests that effective policy trials or being able to try out an option can build public support for sustainable options and policy19.

Second, public acceptability depends on how the costs and benefits of options and policies are distributed across groups (i.e., distributive fairness): sustainable options and policies are more acceptable when their costs and benefits are distributed equally across groups, and when vulnerable groups, future generations, and nature and the environment are protected25. Distributive fairness can be enhanced by compensation schemes, for example, by offering additional benefits to people who would be negatively affected by the proposed changes. For example, public acceptability of pricing policies is higher when redistributing revenues toward those affected74, and when earmarking revenues for environmental purposes25,26,76.

Third, public acceptability of sustainable options and policy depends on which decision procedures were followed, as reflected in perceptions of procedural fairness. The implementation of sustainable options and policies is perceived as more fair and acceptable when transparent procedures have been followed, when the public or public society organizations could participate in the decision-making, and when people feel that their interests and concerns have been taken seriously25.

Fourth, public support is higher when individuals trust responsible parties19. Trust in responsible parties is important as the general public typically does not have sufficient expertise or the capacity to understand all aspects of options, and thus needs to rely on the expertise and good intentions of agents who are responsible for designing and implementing the options. Public acceptability appears to more strongly depend on trust in the integrity of responsible actors (i.e., whether they are believed to be transparent and honest) than on the perceived competence of responsible actors77.

Policies and Kaya identity

To conclude this section on policies, the following lists present a selection of climate mitigation policies categorized according to the three components of the Kaya identity applied to the transport sector. Each policy aims to reduce total CO2 emissions by targeting either the carbon intensity of energy use (CO2/E), the energy efficiency of transport activity (E/PKT), or the overall travel demand (PKT).

\({(\frac{{CO}_{2}}{E})}_{m}\) — Fuel choice

Public investment in renewable energy is funded through climate policy revenues.

Information campaigns promoting the adoption of lower-carbon fuels.

\({(\frac{E}{PKT})}_{m}\) — Technology choice

Fuel economy regulations require more efficient vehicles.

Emissions labeling for vehicles to inform technology choices.

Congestion pricing to improve traffic flow and reduce energy intensity.

Green deal plans to invest in efficient mobility technologies.

The complexity of behavioral dimensions in response to climate change actions necessitates the design and development of decision-aid tools. These tools aim to assist policymakers in designing, optimizing, and anticipating the impacts of various measures. This section introduces a methodological framework for developing such tools that involves the collection of behavioral data and the design of a modeling framework.

As illustrated in Fig. 2, the methodological framework integrates policy design, behavioral modeling, performance measurement, and optimization in a continuous, iterative process. This approach utilizes a diverse range of input data, including exogenous data such as energy prices and economic conditions78; behavioral data (including factors influencing behavior) collected through experiments and surveys (see “High-quality behavioral data” section); and a global typology of individuals and households representing different demographic, socio-economic, and geographic segments. This typology also represents the population of business establishments. Within such a typology, synthetic populations of individuals, households, and establishments with the same statistical properties of the actual populations can be created79,80.

Behavioral models and simulation

The role of behavioral models and simulations is to predict individual and group responses at a disaggregate level. These models can simulate various scenarios to understand potential outcomes of the policy measures. They generate various numerical indicators that characterize the behavioral responses for each of those scenarios.

Individuals make numerous choices that are relevant for analyzing decarbonization policies. These choices pertain to their activities, travels, and energy consumption, among others. Some decisions are long-term, such as house location, the type of heating system, or vehicle ownership, while others are short-term, like travel mode and destination for specific activities. These decisions may be modeled simultaneously, as proposed by Pougala et al.81, Pougala et al.82, and Rezvany et al.83, or they may be modeled sequentially (e.g., ref. 84). An example of a behavioral modeling and simulation platform for urban transportation that adopts a sequential approach is shown in Fig. 384.

In the same spirit, Knapen et al.85 use an activity-based micro-simulation that generates travel schedules and uses them to estimate EV charging demand profiles across time and space. Additional simulation models incorporate Land Use and Transport Interactions (LUTI) to examine the long-term impacts of policies40.

The behavioral dimensions explicitly represented include:

Individual characteristics: Measurable variables about each individual, including age, income, gender, or health status.

Latent Characteristics: Individual characteristics—such as perceived costs and benefits of options and policies, attitudes, social norms, values, perceptions, and emotions—play an important role in shaping behavior. These include factors like skepticism, denial, or guilt, as well as perceptions of inequity, moral licensing (e.g., “I am already doing enough”), or overconfidence (e.g., “technology will solve everything”).

Implicit Choice Set: Various types of constraints, including resource constraints (e.g., availability of vehicles in a household), regulatory constraints (e.g., some destinations cannot be reached by carbonized modes of transportation, or heating systems with strong GHG emissions are forbidden), and contextual constraints (e.g., extreme weather, floods, earthquakes).

Utility Functions: These combine all the above variables to characterize the preferences of individuals.

The behavioral models are typically grounded in random utility theory86, while the simulation environment captures and propagates uncertainty by combining causal models and simulating their distribution across agents and outcomes.

The raw output of the simulation is an empirical distribution of detailed schedules, where all modeled choices made by each (synthetic) individual/household and establishment are explicitly represented.

The use of disaggregate simulation tools poses several challenges:

Behavioral assumptions: The underlying assumptions of rational decision-making and stable preferences may not always hold under real-world conditions. The integration of latent variables enables the explicit representation of bounded rationality, social influence, and evolving social norms27,87.

Model calibration: Calibrating behavioral models is complex, particularly due to the high dimensionality of parameters and limited observability of preferences88. Bayesian methods offer increased flexibility in fusing diverse data sources and managing uncertainty89,90.

Model validation: Validating disaggregate models is equally demanding, often requiring rich, high-resolution behavioral data91. Modern sources such as mobile phone location data92 are proving increasingly valuable in this regard.

Computational complexity: Large-scale agent-based simulations and the incorporation of deep uncertainty place significant demands on computational resources. This has motivated the development of efficient formulations and surrogate models to reduce simulation time while preserving model fidelity93,94.

Data requirements: Developing detailed behavioral models—whether using simultaneous or sequential structures—requires disaggregate data on individual and household decision-making processes, as well as establishment-level behaviors. These data needs are discussed further in the next subsection.

High-quality behavioral data

Multiple sources of data, including surveys and big data, can and should be used to develop and inform the behavioral models described in our methodological framework. Naturally, each type of data has inherent advantages and limitations. As such, these sources are best used in combination with one another through data fusion approaches.

In the transport field, recall-based travel surveys, which for many years have been the key source of travel and activity behavioral data, are being replaced or supplemented with advanced approaches that combine mobile sensing, the use of contextual data sources, such as transit network, POI and land-use data, and machine learning computational/inference techniques to obtain more accurate, complete, and richer human mobility and activity information (see, for example, ref. 95). When combined with app- or web-based user interfaces that enable participants to view, edit, and verify their travel timelines as well as provide additional details about their trips and activities, the data obtained provides a full storyline of how, when, and why people travel. Such approaches are increasingly being applied in household travel surveys (e.g., ref. 96) and other research programs to provide a rich, contextual understanding of how people interact with their environment, their mobility and activity patterns, and lifestyle choices. These methods can also be used to obtain detailed behavioral data from business establishments providing passenger and freight transport (see, for example, ref. 97 and ref. 98). Without such detailed behavioral data, we could not develop the kinds of models that were described in the previous section.

As with other types of surveys, these data collection methods require recruitment of samples of individuals, households, or business establishments to participate. Participants must be willing to have their personal data (e.g., location data) collected. Data privacy regulations, designed to protect personal data, can be complex and strict, posing challenges for data controllers and processors administering the surveys. Due to cost and time constraints, data collection typically involves relatively small samples (at least as compared to big data) and, in the past, has only been done intermittently, every few or several years. In today’s rapidly changing world, longitudinal data collection, which tracks behavioral dynamics and the factors influencing them over time, is also essential for understanding how and why habits and preferences evolve, and some transportation agencies are moving toward developing more continuous data collection programs.

Transportation agencies are also exploring how big data can be used to model travel behavior. Big data comes from a range of sources, including mobile devices and apps, connected vehicles, transit smart cards, smart road sensors, and geo-tagged social media posts (e.g., ref. 99). With its voluminous datasets and longitudinal nature, big data can be invaluable in revealing patterns of behavior across a wide range of domains, especially travel and mobility. The ability to use big data to monitor what people do when conditions change, e.g., during the COVID pandemic, can be extremely informative in modeling behavior (e.g., ref. 100).

However, a deficiency of big data is that it lacks sufficient detail and is missing variables with explanatory power. This lack of context (e.g., ref. 101) can lead to erroneous assumptions when solely using these data for decision-making and policy design. Another aspect of big data’s “thinness” is that, as with all data distributions, it may have a tail with very few observations, e.g., people who use public transit in a car-dependent city. While sampling plans for travel surveys are typically designed with stratification and oversampling to ensure representation, it may not be possible to oversample certain types of observations with big data, for which datasets are automatically generated.

Survey and big data, as described above, are revealed preferences (RP), meaning data derived from observed or reported actual behaviors and only pertaining to existing situations or conditions. To develop and optimize solutions that do not currently exist or to study attributes that are not captured in big data, stated preferences (SP) data are also required. RP data can be leveraged to develop context-specific SP surveys to allow researchers to test consumer reactions to new solutions, scenarios, and policies in a more realistic, informed manner. This combination of revealed and stated preferences ensures that new initiatives are grounded in actual behavior patterns, increasing their likelihood of success. These enriched datasets enable the development of personalized solutions tailored to individual needs and behaviors (e.g., ref. 102). For example, individuals with high price sensitivity to a carbon tax are more likely to adopt public transportation or active mobility solutions. Such personalized treatments are essential to motivating individuals to switch to sustainable solutions (e.g., ref. 103).

Given the strengths and limitations inherent in each type of data, the greatest potential for improving our ability to understand and predict behavior lies in the integration of different types of data in modeling and simulation systems104. For example, big data has the potential to be enriched with context through fusion with mobile sensing-based survey data, and small samples of survey data can be expanded by its integration with big data. It is incumbent upon researchers to develop effective data fusion approaches to take maximum advantage of the wealth of data available to ensure the optimal design of policies and initiatives related to transport decarbonization.

Indicators

The generated schedules can then be used to measure a wide variety of key indicators. By predicting the decisions of each (synthetic) individual in the population, it becomes straightforward to aggregate individual indicators to obtain their population-level counterparts. For instance, emissions can be derived from travel choices and participation in certain activities. Individual well-being is measured by the utility function within the framework, alongside variables such as health status. Costs are directly derived from the expenses associated with each decision related to activity participation and travel.

Optimization

These indicators then feed into the optimization phase, where sophisticated optimization techniques are employed to adjust policies and better achieve desired outcomes. The goal is to reconfigure the policies based on the performance of the indicators to enhance their overall effectiveness. This process often involves multi-objective optimization, where improving one indicator may inadvertently deteriorate another (as illustrated by Fig. 1).

For instance, increasing subsidy levels for electric vehicles could significantly boost their adoption, reducing emissions and contributing to environmental goals. However, this might also lead to increased government expenditure, affecting budget constraints and potentially limiting funds available for other crucial sectors like healthcare or education. Similarly, policies aimed at enhancing individual well-being through increased access to recreational activities might lead to higher emissions due to increased travel.

Balancing these competing objectives requires a careful and strategic approach. The concept of “Pareto optimality” can be employed to identify solutions that offer the best possible trade-offs between conflicting objectives. This concept is grounded in the principle of dominance. A policy P1 is said to dominate a policy P2 if no indicator associated with P1 is worse than the corresponding indicator for P2, and at least one indicator of P1 is strictly better than the corresponding indicator for P2. A policy is considered Pareto optimal if it is not dominated by any feasible solution.

Once policymakers are presented with the set of Pareto optimal solutions, they can evaluate the relative importance of each indicator and make informed decisions that align with broader societal goals. This approach contrasts with single-objective optimization, where the relative importance of each indicator must be established before any analysis, often in an arbitrary and non-transparent manner. Thanks to the multi-objective approach and the a posteriori weighting, the trade-offs are more transparent, allowing for a clearer understanding of the implications of each decision.

Policy measures

Policy measures aimed at reducing carbon emissions encompass strategies such as carbon pricing, subsidies for renewable energy, emission regulations, and infrastructure investments.

For example, implementing a carbon tax to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions is a prevalent policy approach.

In our methodological framework, each measure can affect various factors:

The value of variables in the utility function: For instance, a carbon tax increases the monetary cost of several options, altering the utility associated with different choices.

The set of constraints individuals face: For example, a policy restricting access to city centers for carbon-emitting transportation modes would influence the selection of destinations for certain activities.

Subjective aspects influencing decisions: For instance, a policy that includes transparent communication about the redistribution of carbon tax revenue might alter the public perception of the tax’s equity.

The whole process is iterative and dynamic, continuously refining policies based on real-time data and feedback. By leveraging these techniques, it is possible to create a balanced policy framework that maximizes overall benefits while minimizing negative impacts, ensuring a sustainable and equitable approach to societal development.

To illustrate, consider the implementation of a congestion charge in a city. The policy is first modeled to simulate commuter responses using travel survey data. The indicators monitored might include traffic volumes, emissions levels, public transport usage, and economic impacts on commuters. Optimization could involve adjusting the congestion charge rates and timings based on these indicators to balance traffic reduction with economic fairness. Throughout this process, inputs such as fuel prices, public transport availability, and travel patterns from GPS data are utilized, along with synthetic populations representing different commuter types.

By using this comprehensive framework, policymakers can design, test, implement, and refine decarbonization strategies effectively, ensuring they are both efficient and equitable.

Scientific challenges

The design, implementation, and application of such a framework are particularly challenging. We briefly discuss some of those challenges.

Deep Uncertainty: One of the primary methodological challenges in developing decarbonization policies is dealing with deep uncertainty. This refers to situations where the probabilities of future events are unknown, and the possible outcomes are numerous and varied. Traditional scenario planning, which involves creating a limited set of detailed scenarios, may not be sufficient to capture the full range of uncertainties. Scenario discovery, on the other hand, uses data-driven techniques to identify and explore a broader array of possible futures. For example, rather than just planning for best-case and worst-case scenarios, scenario discovery might reveal a spectrum of outcomes based on different combinations of policy measures, technological advancements, and societal behaviors105,106.

Disaggregate Policy-Sensitive Models: Another critical issue is the development of disaggregate policy-sensitive models that can accurately capture the causality of human activities. These models focus on individual or household-level behaviors and decisions, providing a granular understanding of how people respond to specific policies. There is a long tradition of such models in travel demand analysis107, where disaggregate choice models108 are used in micro-simulation tools109,110.

Multi-Scale Models: The integration of models across multiple scales is critical for a comprehensive understanding of the broader impacts of various policies. Multi-scale models synthesize data and insights from microscopic (individual or household level), mesoscopic (community or regional level), and macroscopic (national or global level) scales111,112. By leveraging these different scales, researchers can perform an in-depth analysis of how local actions accumulate to influence broader trends. For instance, a multi-scale model might combine local traffic data113 with regional air quality models114 and detailed time use data115.

Scalability: Scalability poses a significant methodological challenge: how to effectively apply microscopic models on a global scale116. Although microscopic models offer detailed insights, they are often computationally intensive and require vast amounts of data. Scaling these models globally necessitates innovative approaches, such as employing representative samples, leveraging parallel computing, and utilizing machine learning techniques. For instance, scaling an urban transportation model globally might involve selecting representative cities from various regions and extrapolating the results while considering regional differences in behavior and infrastructure.

Propagation of uncertainty: The primary role of simulation is to represent the propagation of uncertainty through complex systems. This involves generating empirical realizations of complex random variables, which are often defined on combinatorially intricate state spaces. Advanced techniques, such as variance reduction methods117 and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods118,119, can be particularly effective in this context.

The proposed framework is merely a high-level preliminary concept, and the list of challenges it presents is certainly much longer and more complex than outlined above.

In particular, future work should explore how such behavioral models can be embedded within broader governance frameworks. Rather than treating policies as isolated instruments, there is a need to model coordinated policy packages that align fiscal tools, regulatory mechanisms, and spatial accessibility measures into a cohesive system120. Embedding the agent-based simulation framework within participatory or adaptive governance is an important research avenue.

This research direction requires an interdisciplinary approach, involving collaboration among engineers, economists, computer scientists, psychologists, political scientists, climate experts, and other specialists. The richness of this field ensures it will fill the research agendas of numerous research teams.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs44333-025-00075-z/MediaObjects/44333_2025_75_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2026-01-20 13:57:00.986154

The report also estimates that combined production capacity for renewable diesel and SAF could rise to more than 67 million tonnes a year by 2036, as both fuels rely on similar processing methods, reports AIN.

The study said last year marked an important turning point for SAF, with the introduction of mandatory usage rules in both the UK and the European Union. These measures have created guaranteed demand for the fuel. Report author Eve Pope said demand is expected to keep increasing as more rules aimed at cutting emissions are introduced.

While there are close to a dozen approved ways to produce SAF, most current supply comes from a process that uses used cooking oil, animal fats and grease as raw materials. However, the availability of these inputs is limited. Pope said demand for SAF is likely to exceed the supply of these materials by around 2030.

To address this gap, newer production methods such as alcohol-based conversion and synthetic SAF are expected to play a larger role.

The transport industry is a large adopter of clean energy technologies, largely due to the expectations of lowering carbon footprints and the desire to realize sustainability targets. Solar canopy charging, hydrogen generator charging, and airborne wind energy charging are all avenues explored by IDTechEx as a means of powering electric vehicles away from grid access. IDTechEx's report, ""Off-Grid Charging For Electric Vehicles 2024-2034: Technologies, Benchmarking, Players and Forecasts"", covers different off-grid EV charging methods, and provides forecasts for their uptake over the next ten years.

Solar canopy charging carports that are completely independent from the grid could see cars charging simply from being parked underneath solar panels and plugged into a charging outlet. Labelled as the fastest growing source of renewable energy by IDTechEx, solar power can provide cheaper means of generating energy, especially when compared to fossil fuel projects.

'Top-up charging', where drivers can recharge little and often, may suit electric vehicles better, as they never have to worry about running too low and struggling to source power. Issues surrounding energy storage and intermittency may arise with solar canopy chargers, which without grid stability, may prove difficult to abate. However, when used mostly as a charge boost, solar canopy charging offers an environmentally friendly and smart way to keep vehicles energized.

Wind power, though also a promising means of renewable energy, is currently too expensive and large to feasibly use for electric vehicle charging, according to IDTechEx. However, airborne wind energy (AWE) could be a loophole, which sees a tether-based device being able to harness power from high-altitude winds, while incurring less material costs. AWE can also provide more consistency when compared to solar, given its ability to work even in the dark, and increasing the surface area of the device could increase power generation without affecting the ground footprint.

Hydrogen for land and sky transportation

Hydrogen could provide a means of charging up battery electric vehicles, as opposed to fuel-cell electric vehicles, by having external fuel cells produce electricity from outside of the vehicle. Hydrogen chargers could have an integrated battery, but also rely on stored, compressed hydrogen as energy storage. While this could provide a solution to off-grid or temporary power situations, IDTechEx states that the costs of hydrogen charging, especially when using green hydrogen to maximize sustainability, would be very high. However, as renewable energy costs decrease as they become more widely available, hydrogen charging could see a noticeable uptake.

Hydrogen planes could be a new means of travel in the future, with the only emission produced in-flight being water vapour, and would be a great development for the environment and reducing the carbon footprint of air travel. Liquid hydrogen fuel cell planes could have between 30 and 40% of the range of a jet fuel plane, which could mean a travel range of several thousand kilometers is possible. This would be ideal for shorter journeys of under 2,000km, which is where over 50% of travel demand lies by seats, according to IDTechEx. The report, ""Sustainable Future Aviation 2025-2045: Trends, Technologies, Forecasts"", covers different ways to decarbonize the air travel sector, including the introduction of battery-powered planes and the implementation of sustainable aviation fuel.

The creation of green hydrogen with electrolysis

With the expansion of hydrogen applications in line with increasing decarbonization efforts, green hydrogen in particular is drawing attention as being the most environmentally beneficial in its use. Green hydrogen is produced with water electrolysis, with many different electrolyzer types on the market, each with their own benefits.

Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, for example, can offer more compact system designs and much smaller footprints when compared with alkaline systems. PEMELs high power densities are as a result of their solid proton exchange membrane, and they are a popular commercial option for producing green hydrogen with advancing technologies being developed. Solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) electrolyzers operate at the lowest voltage range and therefore can be considered one of the most efficient technologies. This is possible as a result of leveraging high temperatures and enabling favorable thermodynamics, according to IDTechEx. More types of electrolyzers used to produce green hydrogen, and their best suited applications, are covered in detail in IDTechEx's report, ""Materials for Green Hydrogen Production 2026-2036: Technologies, Players, Forecasts"".

Turning hydrogen into electricity

Fuel cells operate with the input of hydrogen fuel and an oxygen source which undergo a chemical reaction that results in the generation of electricity to power an external load, alongside water and heat. Stationary fuel cells refer to this process occurring in a fixed place, either permanently or semi-permanently, and are usually operating within a fuel cell stack as part of a larger system.

Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are more favoured within stationary applications including industrial power and commercial operations, for continuous generation. Other types such as proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are more desired within mobile applications such as in the transport sector and are also becoming contenders for back-up power generation in the replacement of diesel generators.",https://www.renewableenergymagazine.com/ficheroenergias/fotos/windfarm.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 13:57:11.671256
