The new arrangement, a source familiar with the development hinted is coming on the heels of infractions associated with the operations of private jets in the last few years forcing the government to lose over N120 billion .

Besides the huge revenue loss, the government, it was learnt is not comfortable with infractions associated with the business jet value , which could jeopardize national security, deepen illicit activities as well as advance drug trafficking and money laundering.

Part of measures considered to clean up private jet operations may include temporary closure of the General Aviation Terminal (GAT), at Abuja Airport and other aerodromes majorly utilised by fixed based operators.

The Federal Government is embarking on these measures to enable the country optimise benefits in the burgeoning private jet global market which has grown from $28.01 billion in 2024 to $30.08 billion in 2025 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.4 per cent.

The growth in the historic period, experts say is attributed to rising demand for business travel increasing need for private aircraft, growing wealth among high-net-worth individuals boosted private jet purchases, increasing global economic growth, rising frequency of international travel expanding the market for long-range private jets and increasing adoption of fractional ownership programs making private flying more accessible.

Global air transport data base provider : Statista projects that private aircraft market size is expected to see strong growth in the next few years.

According to Statista data , private jet operations will grow to $39.62 billion in 2029 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.1per cent.

It projected growth in the forecast period as attributable to expansion of on-demand private jet services. It cited the anticipated growth to be triggered by technological advancements in aircraft efficiency and safety, growing emphasis on personalized travel experiences occasioning increase in private jet usage, increasing number of high-net-worth individuals in emerging economies.

The data listed other drivers to include : technological advancements by major companies that will introduce more efficient and eco-friendly private aircraft models, increased adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the rise of hybrid and electric private aircraft , which is expected to transform the industry, growing demand for customized and luxury interiors.

Only last week, Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Mr Festus Keyamo vowed to tackle all illegal chartered operations and related matters in Nigeria.

Keyamo spoke while receiving the report of the seven-member committee on illegal chartered operations and related matters at the ministry’s headquarters in Abuja.

The minister said the issue of illegal charter operations by private jets and private aircraft owners has been besetting Nigeria’s aviation sector.

He said those who obtain licences under the permit for non-commercial flight (PNCF) use the aircraft for other illegal transactions.

Keyamo said the federal government is poised to mitigate the acts, pledging that his ministry will not fail to safeguard the aviation industry in line with its mandate.

“This practice has been going on for many years before I became Minister, but I thought there was a need to confront it headlong,” he said.

“When you cannot track them, it leads to money laundering, drug trafficking, illegal entry and exits into the country and all kinds of illegal activities.”

Keyamo commended the efforts of the task force in producing the report and outlining recommendations to tackle the challenge.

He assured that the ministry would critically examine the report and its recommendations, stressing that it would not be swept under the carpet.

Meanwhile, during the presentation of the report, Ado Sanusi, chairman of the task force, said the committee conducted a thorough investigation into illegal private charter operations in Nigeria and identified critical challenges which include regulatory weaknesses, loopholes in the PNCF system, inadequate oversight, security vulnerabilities, and significant revenue losses to the government.

Sanusi said the findings pose risks to aviation safety and also create an uneven playing field for legitimate operators.

He said part of the committee’s recommendations is that the government should strengthen regulatory oversight, enhance security measures, improve compliance with aviation laws, and ensure that private charter operations are conducted transparently and in line with international standards.

He appealed to the minister to ensure a quick implementation of the suggestions, saying they would create an economically viable aviation industry in Nigeria.",https://cdn.thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/26202351/Charter-jets.jpg,N,,2025-03-09 21:50:51.739266

The Farm to Fly Act was largely adopted within the 2024 House Agriculture Committee Farm Bill.
“The Farm to Fly Act will provide access to new markets for our nation’s farmers, drive rural economic development, and strengthen our domestic energy resources,” said Congressman Miller.
“I’m proud to join Congressman Max Miller in introducing the bipartisan Farm to Fly Act that will allow homegrown biofuels to power our aviation sector while supporting growth in rural economies.
Flood, Finstad, Budzinski, Tenney, Mann, Bost, Bacon, Feenstra, D. Johnson, Alford, Sorensen, Miller-Meeks and Fischbach for the reintroduction of the Farm to Fly Act.","WASHINGTON — U.S. Congressman Max Miller (OH-07) reintroduced the Farm to Fly Act to create new, robust markets for American agricultural products and strengthen domestic energy resources. Miller was joined by Representatives Mike Flood (R-NE), Brad Finstad (R-MN), Nikki Budzinski (D-IL), Claudia Tenney (R-NY), Tracey Mann (R-KS), Mike Bost (R-IL), Don Bacon (R-NE), Randy Feenstra (R-IA), Dusty Johnson (R-SD), Mark Alford (R-MO), Eric Sorensen (D-IL), Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-IA), and Michelle Fischbach (R-MN) as original cosponsors. Senators Moran (R-KS), Grassley (R-IA), Duckworth (D-IL), Ricketts (R-NE), Klochubar (D-MN), and Ernst (R-IA) introduced the Senate companion, S.144, in January.

The Farm to Fly Act was largely adopted within the 2024 House Agriculture Committee Farm Bill. The bill would foster the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) within existing U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs, allow for greater collaboration, and ensure USDA’s SAF definitions reflect eligibility for American agricultural crops.

“The Farm to Fly Act will provide access to new markets for our nation’s farmers, drive rural economic development, and strengthen our domestic energy resources,” said Congressman Miller. “I’m grateful for the close collaboration between my colleagues, Ohio and American agricultural producers, and the aviation industry. I look forward to seeing this through to lift American farmers to new heights and strengthen our nation’s energy supply.”

“Expanding opportunities for biofuels will not only help family farmers across the country but will also help connect more American businesses with homegrown clean energy,” said Congressman Flood. “Making the eligibility criteria for Sustainable Aviation Fuels at the U.S. Department of Agriculture clearer is a great step forward on this journey. Thank you to Congressman Miller for your leadership on the Farm to Fly Act, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to move this commonsense legislation quickly.”

“Sustainable Aviation Fuel continues to be a promising market for our ag producers and brings greater opportunity for U.S. farmers to partner with the aviation sector,” said Congressman Finstad. “I am proud to join my colleagues in introducing this bipartisan legislation, which develops new markets for Minnesota farmers, opens the door to future opportunities for rural economic development, and strengthens American energy independence with fuel grown right here at home.”

“By utilizing sustainable aviation fuel, we can cut harmful emissions, support family farmers and reduce our dependence on foreign energy sources,” said Congresswoman Budzinski. “I’m proud to join Congressman Max Miller in introducing the bipartisan Farm to Fly Act that will allow homegrown biofuels to power our aviation sector while supporting growth in rural economies. With this bill we can empower the USDA to drive a sustainable future for our aviation industry.”

“This bill will make SAF production eligible for existing biofuels programs at USDA, providing a burgeoning market for Nebraska’s producers during this time of economic uncertainty in the agricultural industry,” said Congressman Bacon. “I look forward to working with Rep. Miller to make this bill a reality.”

“Homegrown biofuels are critical to American energy independence and sustainable aviation fuel is vital to the future of air travel. By converting agricultural biomass into airplane fuel, Iowa farmers and producers will benefit from new markets, and we can use domestic energy – instead of foreign oil – to power our planes,” said Congressman Feenstra. “I’m glad to work with my Ways and Means colleague, Rep. Max Miller, to introduce the Farm to Fly Act to include SAF in USDA bio-energy programs and promote the use of SAF for airline fuel. Representing the top biofuel-producing district in the nation, our farmers and producers will play a pivotal role in the future of air travel powered by homegrown American fuels.”

Support for Farm to Fly from Industry:

“The Farm to Fly Act creates new opportunities for Ohio’s corn growers. Investing in SAF solutions strengthens Ohio’s agricultural economy and enhances national security. We look forward to collaborating with policymakers to support the ongoing partnership between Ohio’s corn growers and the aviation industry.” — Tadd Nicholson, Executive Director of Ohio Corn & Wheat.

“Sustainable aviation fuel is rooted in America’s agricultural sector. The Farm to Fly Act expands opportunities for U.S. farmers and strengthens USDA’s role in SAF development—enhancing our energy dominance, driving rural economic growth, and reinforcing American innovation in fuel production. We commend Representatives Miller, Flood, Finstad, Budzinski, Tenney, Mann, Bost, Bacon, Feenstra, D. Johnson, Alford, Sorensen, Miller-Meeks, and Fischbach for their commitment to advancing policies that support SAF and the agricultural communities that make it possible.” — Alison Graab, Executive Director of the SAF Coalition

“The Farm to Fly Act is a win-win-win: The bill supports America’s farmers, bolsters energy independence, and incentivizes production of SAF for the aviation sector. Congressman Miller continues to be a strong advocate in this space, and we appreciate his foresight, commitment, and leadership. We are encouraged by the additional bipartisan support of Reps. Flood, Finstad, Budzinski, Tenney, Mann, Bost, Bacon and Feenstra and others.” — Airlines for America

“The Farm to Fly Act is a game-changer for American agriculture, creating new economic opportunities while strengthening our nation’s energy security. By recognizing Sustainable Aviation Fuel as an eligible resource under USDA bio-energy programs, this legislation will empower farmers, ethanol producers, and rural communities to lead in the next generation of clean energy solutions.” — Tom Buis, CEO of American Carbon Alliance

“Gevo is thrilled to see the reintroduction of the Farm to Fly Act, a positive step forward for economic opportunity, agriculture, and securing American energy independence. This legislation will be critical to helping diversify domestic fuel production while creating new opportunities for our nation’s farmers and rural communities. We’d like to extend a special thanks to the bill’s House sponsor Representative Max Miller (R-OH) for his continued support of American farmers and the domestic SAF industry.” — Lindsay Fitzgerald, Gevo VP of Corporate Affairs

“The Renewable Fuels Association thanks Rep. Miller, as well as cosponsors Reps. Flood, Finstad, Budzinski, Tenney, Mann, Bost, Bacon, Feenstra, D. Johnson, Alford, Sorensen, Miller-Meeks and Fischbach for the reintroduction of the Farm to Fly Act. RFA supports this important legislation, which would bring clarity and stability to the future of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) made from U.S. crops. By affirming SAF’s inclusion in USDA programs and ensuring the best science is used, this bill empowers domestic agriculture to participate in the emerging SAF market.” — Geoff Cooper, RFA President and CEO

Specifically, the Farm to Fly Act would:

Clarify eligibility for Sustainable Aviation Fuels within current U.S. Department of Agriculture Bio-Energy Programs expanding markets for American agricultural crops through aviation bioenergy;

Provide for greater collaboration for aviation biofuels throughout U.S. Department of Agriculture agency mission areas, increasing private sector partnerships; and

Affirm a common definition of SAF for USDA purposes, as widely supported by industry and congressional leaders to enable U.S. crops to most effectively contribute to aviation renewable fuels.

We have been talking about carbon sequestration since the 90’s when I was in school and nothing has changed.
The problem with the carbon industry as it sits right now, is we are trying to assign values of who is farming better or farming worse based on their carbon capture.","By Dusty Sonnenberg, CCA, Field Leader, a project of the Ohio Soybean Council and Soybean Check-off

Some people take years to decide what they want to do when they grow up. Others figure it out by the 5th grade. That was the case for Ryan Martin, Chief Meteorologist at the Ohio Ag Net and Ohio’s Country Journal. “In 5th grade we were supposed to get up and everybody in the class had to choose a day when we had to get on the PA speaker and read the weather,” said Martin. “My day came, and I got all the weather information for the day’s weather forecast and I stood up on that podium, and into the receiver said I’m meteorologist Ryan and here’s the weather for today. I decided right then that I wanted to be a meteorologist, so I passed up some full ride football scholarships to go and get a degree in agricultural meteorology at Purdue.” Martin has been forecasting the weather for a number of different organizations since the late 1990’s.

Martin’s passion for weather forecasting came from growing up on a farm in New Paris, Indiana. “I just wanted to be able to tell folks when to cut hay. It seemed like when I was growing up if we had a day to cut hay it would rain, so I wanted to be able to do that,” said Martin.

Martin is also a farmer and grain marketer. “I ended up getting into futures and options trading,” said Martin. “I guess that I was good enough at it, that someone gave me a job. I’m self-taught on futures and options. It is a lot like meteorology, it involves recognition, seeing what’s going on, and using theory. I had a chance to move into the physical grain buying side about 10 years ago, and I haven’t looked back since.” Along with grain origination and marketing, Martin also teaches an undergraduate grain marketing course at Huntington University.

Over the years, Martin has observed several interesting developments in the production and marketing of soybeans. “Over the years, it has been really interesting to watch the development on the demand side of the equation for soybeans. As I teach my students, it really boils down to supply and demand. So many times, when I am out talking about weather and markets, someone will ask me about what they have read or heard from the experts about resistance and a bunch of technical stuff. They want to know where the market will go. It really boils down to supply and demand. Look at all the new demand channels that have come online over the years. I was doing a 30-year retrospective for my marketing class this past week. We discussed the way the markets move, and the market volatility in the 70’s, the 80’s, the 90’s, the early 2000’s and the 2010’s. You could tell exactly when China became a force in the market on soybeans. You could tell again the next time that the big market shift came. It wasn’t on the demand side; it was on the supply side. You can see it in the volatility when Brazil came online. The same when other countries in South America came online as a huge force in soybean production.

“When I’m looking at trends I’m looking at when the next big supply or demand hiccup that we see may be coming,” said Martin. “We are seeing some of that occur this year. Regionally, bird flu can be a fairly significant demand impact on a local scale and it is something that the industry tries to pay attention to. There is also the talk about tariffs and what that does to our demand profile in the global marketplace. I think the shift that we have seen, from the market out your back door to market on a global scale, has been the biggest shift in the past 25-30 years in this industry.”

The renewable fuels industry has had people talking about creating demand for several years. “I had farmers approach me at the Fort Wayne Farm Show back in 2018 or 2019 telling me exactly what I was going to have to pay them for their soybeans because of sustainable aviation fuel,” said Martin. “Here we are 5-6 years later, and we are still just talking about it. Besides soybeans, sustainable aviation fuel can also be made from used cooking oil and other feedstocks.”

Another topic related to renewable fuels is the carbon industry and the connection to agriculture and sustainability practices. “This is scary to me,” said Martin. “I can put on the grain originator hat and look at it from that perspective, but I prefer to put on the farmer hat as I shape my thoughts. We have been talking about carbon sequestration since the 90’s when I was in school and nothing has changed. We have been talking about no-till and cover crop farming for years. There are a lot more people that no-till, especially soybeans, now than ever did before, and it’s great. It’s great for soil. It’s great for our Earth in general. But these are not new practices or conversations. The problem with the carbon industry as it sits right now, is we are trying to assign values of who is farming better or farming worse based on their carbon capture. This all comes back to data, and that is what scares me. Suddenly, every single scrap of data that goes into your farming of a crop in a field is going to need to be captured, and it’s going to have to be given to somebody, most likely your grain buyer. They are going to have your field shape file and will need to have data on every single pass that you made across that field. They are going to need access to your yields, and access to all sorts of things.”

“If this part comes to fruition, then you have to deal with data audits,” said Martin. “The party that has that data is going to get audited. If you get a 45Z tax credit, or if you get some kind of carbon kickback, then you are opening yourself up to be audited.”

Harkening back to his 5th grade weather days, Martin is often asked to look ahead to what the coming growing season has in store. “When we look at long term weather, we look at patterns,” said Martin. “What I have found is the times that we have come out of an exceptionally dry fall, like what we just did, I looked at 6 years or similar patterns, and I ended up with four of those years leading us to a dryer spring, one of them was super wet, and one was normal.”

“It is worth stating, that it has never been any dryer over a 5 month stretch, August through December, than what we put together last year,” said Martin. “We cannot just come into 2025 and say, 2025 looks a lot like 2008. We can’t say that, but what I can say is that I don’t have a huge concern about planting progress getting delayed this year. I don’t think we’re looking at a scenario where we get into late May, and we are only 40% planted. I think we are better than that this year. I also think that we are going to be seeing a mild year again for spring. We dealt with a bit of a cold snap as we went through that week of Valentine’s. Overall, temperatures will be trying to move up and stay about two to five degrees above normal as we get started into March. With that in my mind, we probably are looking at some early plant opportunities, especially given the not super wet status of the soil. I’m not going to say dry. However, I don’t think that we are as far in a drought scenario as many folks think we are. I think planting looks O.K.”

“I am concerned when it comes to the summer dry period again,” said Martin. “Over the last 4-5 years we have not seen a consistent, steady, timely rainfall. We have really spread these things out. If you look at it in the realm of what normally happens in May, June and July, we have hit the averages each month, just not as we would like to. It seems to be happening more and more each year, when it is so dry, but then for the month it is recorded as normal rainfall because we got it all in one event and then we are dry again for a while and then get another big one. That’s something that I fear is going to continue in 2025.”",https://ocj.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/future-of-agriculture-article-revised.png,N,,2025-03-09 16:50:27.282456

The post is in English and may signal Georgescu's intention to gain support from outside Romania, particularly the Trump administration and Elon Musk. The latter posted several messages in support of the pro-Russian candidate, despite never showing any interest in or knowledge of Romanian politics.

Several supporters of candidate Călin Georgescu gathered in front of the BEC headquarters and forced the barriers installed by the gendarmes in protest. Security forces intervened, removed the protesters with tear gas, and reinstalled the protective barriers. One gendarme, however, was hit with a blunt object by the protesters.

According to a BEC statement, the candidacies of two other independents, Maria Marcu and Ion Popa, were also rejected. However, the registration of Bucharest mayor Nicușor Dan as a candidate was approved.

Leaders of far-right opposition parties, such as AUR president George Simion and POT leader Ana-Maria Gavrila, protested Georgescu’s rejection. Both parties had gathered signatures in support of the pro-Russian candidate.

Meanwhile, Călin Georgescu is facing a criminal probe, being investigated under judicial supervision. On February 26, the General Prosecutor's Office announced that legal proceedings had been initiated against him for multiple offenses, including incitement to actions against constitutional order, spreading false information, falsifying financial disclosure statements regarding campaign funding, initiating or supporting fascist, racist, or xenophobic organizations, and publicly promoting the cult of individuals convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

According to a recent poll, Georgescu remains the favourite in the presidential elections, followed by the ruling coalition's candidate, Crin Antonescu, and Bucharest mayor Nicușor Dan.

BITE-SIZED UPDATES FROM AROUND THE WORLD

INTERNATIONAL

UK-Japan offshore tie-up – The UK and Japan have struck a memorandum of cooperation for offshore wind energy development, the UK announced on Friday. The deal was agreed between the UK’s Department for Business and Trade and Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, and Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry. It builds on workshops the two sides have held on offshore wind, as well as ongoing collaboration on floating offshore wind technology development, technology standardisation, and supply chain development. Now, the two governments plan to exchange policy experiences and best practices, encourage the build-up of sustainable supply chain capabilities, support bilateral investment between the two countries, and encourage business-led initiatives.

EMEA

For sale – Five bidders have submitted non-binding offers for a minority stake in Eni’s carbon capture and storage (CCS) business, Reuters reported, citing two sources. The suitors include financial investors GIP, HitecVision, and Macquarie, alongside industrial players Snam and Thailand’s PTT Exploration and Production Public Company. Eni plans to sell up to 49% of its CCS unit to fund growth, with investor talks set to intensify in the coming months.

State aid – The EU Commission has approved a €279 mln Czech scheme to support investments in electricity storage facilities to foster the transition towards a net-zero economy. The purpose is to reduce the reliance of Czechia’s electricity system on fossil fuels imports and at facilitating a smooth integration of renewable energy sources in the energy mix. Under the scheme, the aid, fully financed through the Modernisation Fund, will take the form of direct grants, to support the construction of at least 1,500 MWh of new electricity storage capacities. The measure will be open to all storage technologies directly connected to the transmission network or distribution network.

Funding cuts – The UK Treasury is drawing up plans to cut the funding for GB Energy in June’s spending review, the FT reports. The Labour government set up GB Energy as a publicly-owned company to invest in clean energy and accelerate grid decarbonisation, initially pledging it £8.3 bln in taxpayer money over the five-year parliament. But the organisation was only given an initial £100 mln in October’s budget for the first two years, and now ministers are reconsidering whether they can afford the full £8.3 bln, amid mounting pressure on government finances and defence spending. Some of the funds previously set aside for GB Energy may now go towards funding low-interest loans for rooftop solar and shared-ownership wind projects. Questions also exist over whether a previous pledge will be met to provide £13.2 bln for energy efficiency schemes over this parliament.

NO CBAM – The Norwegian government aims to introduce a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) from 2027. CBAM, also adopted by the EU, applies carbon pricing to imported goods such as electricity, cement, aluminium, iron and steel, hydrogen, and fertilisers to prevent carbon leakage and encourage emissions reductions in third countries. Norway plans to align with the EU regulation, with CBAM declarations expected to begin in 2026 before full implementation in 2027. The EU has recently proposed simplifying the regulation and may expand it to cover more goods. Norway’s Climate and Environment Minister Andreas Bjelland Eriksen said this week that the CBAM will ensure a uniform carbon price for goods produced in Norway, the EU, or imported from other countries, benefiting Norwegian industry and jobs. The Norwegian government decided last autumn to implement a CBAM, with the Ministry of Climate and Environment and the Norwegian Environment Agency (Miljodirektoratet) overseeing its introduction. Finance Minister Jens Stoltenberg said CBAM could help maintain Norwegian industry’s competitiveness while incentivising emissions reductions globally. The Norwegian Environment Agency will take the lead in implementing CBAM, coordinating efforts with the Tax Administration (Skatteetaten) and Customs (Tolletaten). The Tax Administration will authorise importers and collect penalties, while Customs will conduct border checks. The Ministry of Climate and Environment invites stakeholders to an information and consultation meeting on CBAM on Mar. 13.

PRA probe – Germany’s antitrust watchdog, the Federal Cartel Office (FCO), has launched an investigation into the impact of price information services provided by Argus Media and S&P Global on the oil wholesale market. This follows an initial inquiry that raised concerns about pricing transparency and competition. Price-reporting agencies (PRAs) such as S&P Global Commodity Insights (Platts) and Argus Media provide price quotations based on reported transactions, which influence wholesale procurement contracts and, indirectly, retail fuel prices. The FCO previously found that oil price quotations relied on limited data, making them susceptible to manipulation, and called for stronger regulations. FCO President Andreas Mundt stated that there were signs of structural competition disruptions in the fuel wholesale trade. In response, both Argus Media and S&P Global defended their methodologies, claiming their assessments reflect market value and promote competition. Argus emphasised that the FCO report did not allege wrongdoing, manipulation, or collusion but rather highlighted concerns about market structure and its effect on fuel prices. The investigation comes amid volatility in European fuel prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the EU’s subsequent ban on Russian refined petroleum products in early 2023. The FCO will use new regulatory powers introduced in 2023 to determine whether significant competition disruptions exist and, if confirmed, address their root causes. Both PRAs have pledged to cooperate with the investigation. (Reuters)

ASIA PACIFIC

Pakistani pushback – Pakistan is resisting the IMF’s proposal to impose a carbon levy on petroleum products, coal, and internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, aimed at discouraging fossil fuel use. The IMF suggested raising the petroleum levy from Rs60 ($0.21) to Rs70 ($0.25) per litre over three years, starting with an initial Rs3 increase. The additional revenue would support green energy initiatives. During discussions on Friday, Pakistani officials expressed concerns over fund allocation and jurisdictional issues, particularly regarding coal, which falls under provincial authority. Unlike taxes shared with provinces, levy collections remain outside the distributable pool, though half of a carbon levy’s revenue would be allocated to provinces. The IMF has also recommended increasing federal excise duty on ICE cars as a form of carbon levy, a proposal supported by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). Cars in Pakistan already face high taxation, accounting for 36% to 45% of their total price. The carbon levy was previously discussed during negotiations for the IMF’s Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), from which Pakistan seeks over $1 bln. Disbursements from this facility will be tied to actual climate-related spending. The government estimates that 10% of Pakistan’s carbon emissions come from transport, necessitating substantial investment in cleaner vehicle alternatives. A five-year New-Energy Vehicles (NEVs) policy is being developed, estimating at least Rs155 bln in additional funding by 2030 for the transition. Pakistan’s transport sector consumes 80% of imported oil, and shifting to cleaner vehicles could save foreign exchange reserves. However, the transition is costly, requiring subsidies, tax incentives, and infrastructure development. The IMF suggests using revenue from the carbon levy to subsidise electric two- and three-wheelers, which remain significantly more expensive than traditional models. The government aims for 90% of new two- and three-wheeler purchases and 30% of four-wheelers to be based on renewable energy by 2030. It is also planning National Vehicle Emissions Efficiency Standards to encourage more efficient vehicles. The World Bank also supports the idea of a carbon tax, highlighting Pakistan’s reliance on costly energy imports as a factor in its fiscal challenges. Meanwhile, Pakistan recently secured a $1.2 bln deferred payment oil deal with Saudi Arabia to manage its balance of payments. (Express Tribune)

Gas collab – Australian Woodside Energy and US service firm Baker Hughes will develop a joint initiative to, they said, “develop a lower carbon power generation technology solution” which will use technology from the New York Stock Exchange-listed Net Power designed with the oil and gas industry in mind. The power platform uses gas as power but captures the resulting CO2 emissions. The two plan to bring in other partners at a later date.

Orica on demand – Australia’s Orica, a chemicals and explosives manufacturer, has announced after-tax write-downs of up to A$350 mln ($220 mln) due to impairments and restructuring in its Latin American and EMEA businesses. This will reduce its first-half statutory net profit by A$300-350 mln, primarily from A$290-335 mln in Latin America and A$10-15 mln in EMEA. Despite this, Orica expects stronger-than-anticipated earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) for the first half, with momentum expected to continue. Separately, Orica announced that it has installed emissions-reducing technology at its Kooragang Island chemicals site in Australia, cutting emissions by 1 Mt. The site, which produces ammonia, nitric acid, and ammonium nitrate, previously released N2O into the atmosphere. The newly implemented EnviNOx process, developed by thyssenkrupp Uhde, converts over 99% of N2O into harmless nitrogen and oxygen. The Kooragang Island site’s emissions have been reduced by 567,000 tonnes of CO2e annually, cutting its scope 1 and 2 emissions by 48%. A similar installation at Orica’s Yarwun plant has reduced emissions by 50%, saving around 200,000 tonnes of CO2e per year. The project, supported by A$13 mln from the New South Wales government and A$25 mln from Orica via green investment financing, earns Australian carbon credits for each tonne of emissions avoided.

Clearing the way – Japan’s Cabinet has approved a bill amending the law on marine renewable energy to expand offshore wind projects into the country’s exclusive economic zone, according to the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry. The amendment aims to support Japan’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and grants the government authority to conduct environmental surveys before issuing permits for offshore renewable projects. It also establishes a system for designating development zones and granting provisional status to project developers. Japan targets 10 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030 and up to 45 GW by 2040.

Partners – The Nishiaizu Town Forestry Association, Toho Bank, and project developer Bywill have signed a partnership agreement aimed at achieving carbon neutrality and ensuring the sustainable management of forests for future generations. Under the agreement, Bywill will handle the application process for J-Credit generation from forests managed by the Nishiaizu Town Forestry Association. Toho Bank and Bywill will work together to find buyers for these credits, helping to promote regional decarbonisation and forest conservation. The initiative aligns with Nishiaizu’s efforts to maintain sustainable forestry, particularly following its post-earthquake forest restoration efforts. It builds on an earlier collaboration between Bywill and Toho Bank, which introduced Bywill to the forestry cooperative. The three parties said they will enhance cooperation by sharing information on environmental values and expanding initiatives supporting carbon neutrality and a circular economy. The revenue from J-Credits will help fund forest conservation and the broader goal of passing down healthy forests to future generations.

Tax me later – Indonesia recently sought France’s support for a technology transfer deal to help green its industries ahead of the EU’s incoming carbon border tax on imports such as fertilisers and aluminium. Coordinating Minister Airlangga urged France to conclude the long-delayed Indonesia-EU trade pact, citing benefits for exports and investment, according to a press release from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. He also pushed for cooperation on hydrogen technology and green financing under the Just Energy Transition Partnership to aid Indonesia’s industrial transition. The I-EU CEPA talks have dragged through 19 rounds over nine years amid rising global trade protectionism.

Fryer to flyer – Cosmo Energy Holdings will launch Japan’s first domestic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in April at its Sakai refinery, using used cooking oil, Reuters reported. The refiner aims to supply 300,000 kilolitres of SAF annually by 2030 through domestic production and imports, meeting 10% of its jet fuel sales. It plans to produce 30,000 kl at Sakai, expand output at Sakaide by 2029, and import from Thailand’s Bangchak and others. Japan targets 1.7 mln kl of SAF by 2030.

Sustainability platform – Malaysian project developer Karbon Hero has launched a platform Sustainability AI, designed to help businesses better understand and improve their sustainability reports. Powered by Google’s Cloud AI and machine learning solutions, the AHMAD.02 Model analyses corporate sustainability reports and provides companies with clear insights on how to improve and achieve compliance with sustainability frameworks. This will empower corporations, governments, and other organisations to accelerate their sustainability goals, the developer said in a statement.

AMERICAS

Domain denied – Gov. Larry Rhoden (R) signed HB 1052 into law today, prohibiting the use of eminent domain for CO2 pipeline projects in South Dakota. In a letter explaining his decision, Rhoden emphasised that the legislation does not halt proposed projects but aims to encourage voluntary easements, rebuild trust, and foster productive discussions between developers and landowners.

Ahoy, truckers – The Trump administration is reported to have stalled a $1 bln initiative aimed at electrifying trucking at the Port of Los Angeles, which was intended to reduce diesel pollution and improve air quality, E&E News said. The region relies heavily on diesel vehicles that contribute significantly to smog and health issues. Experts have estimated that losing EPA funding could delay the transition to electric trucks by five years, leading to increased health risks and allowing China to gain a stronger foothold in the industry.

Setting sail for cleaner seas – Royal Caribbean Group, a global cruise company, has joined the Methane Abatement in Maritime Innovation Initiative (MAMII), a cross-sector effort to reduce methane emissions in the maritime industry. Established in 2022 by Safetytech Accelerator, MAMII focuses on developing technologies to monitor, measure, and mitigate methane emissions from LNG-powered ships. Royal Caribbean joined other members, including BP, Shell, and Chevron, to support methane reduction across the sector.

Permitting power push – Several Republican lawmakers, including Representatives Crenshaw, Weber, Pfluger, and Goldman, requested that US EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin expedite the review of the Texas Railroad Commission’s (RCC) application for primary enforcement authority over Class VI underground injection control wells. In their letter last week, they stated that granting Texas this authority under the Safe Drinking Water Act would improve the permitting process for carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) projects. The lawmakers cited the RRC’s regulatory experience and argued that state-level management could improve efficiency while maintaining environmental protections.

Turbine timeout – On Mar. 6, the governments of Canada and Nova Scotia announced a moratorium on offshore wind development in Georges Bank, prohibiting the issuance of submerged land licences for wind projects in the area. The decision, announced by federal Energy Minister Jonathan Wilkinson and Nova Scotia Energy Minister Trevor Boudreau, aims to protect the region’s marine ecosystem and the commercial fisheries that rely on it.

Put a number on it – The Canadian government is working with cement producer Heidelberg Materials to finalise negotiation on a contribution agreement regarding the company’s CCUS plant, the Ministry of Innovation, Science, and Industry announced this week. The announcement builds on a 2023 MoU between the Government of Canada and Heidelberg Materials to provide up to a total of C$275 mln for the company’s demonstration plant. The Canadian government has already entered into a C$49 mln contribution agreement to support the first phase of the project.

Cleaner campus – The Government of Canada announced C$1.4 mln ($974,000) in funding for McMaster University to support two clean energy projects through the Decarbonisation Incentive Program. The university will receive C$500,000 to transition two buildings from natural gas heating to air-to-water heat pumps and C$923,000 to implement reactor heat reclaiming for the AN Bourns Science Building. The projects are expected to reduce over 2,600 tonnes of GHG by 2030.

New Canadian OECM parks – Five parks have been added to Canada’s Other Effective area-based Conservation Measure (OECM). The OCEMs protect nature by recognising areas that help conserve biodiversity, even if they’re not officially protected parks or reserves, according to the federal government. Ontario’s Navy Island National Historic Site, Fort George National Historic Site, and Rideau Canal National Historic Site, alongside Quebec’s Grosse-Île and Irish Memorial National Historic Site and Alberta’s Ya Ha Tinda Ranch are now recognised for their contributions to conservation.

Chunk of change – Fuel distributors associated with the Brazilian Institute of Oil and Gas (IBP) invested around R$4 bln ($690 mln) in CBIO biofuels credits under the national RenovaBio biofuels carbon market throughout 2024, according to Brazilian paper Veja Negocios. This investment translated into more than 46 mln CBIOs acquired. For 2025, the National Agency for Petroleum, Natural Gas, and Biofuels (ANP) has established a preliminary goal for fuel distributors to purchase 40 mln CBIOs. A Dec. 31 law moreover imposes harsher penalties, including a maximum fine of R$500 mln, for non-compliant firms. RenovaBio has in the past faced criticism for appearing to place smaller fuel distributors, which may have more difficulty weathering CBIO volatility, at a competitive disadvantage relative to their larger peers.

VOLUNTARY

SBTi outreach – The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has partnered with Climate Action for Associations (CAFA) in an effort to provide trade associations with the tools and guidance needed to drive emissions reductions, the standard setter announced on Friday. The two sides plan to create a programme of outreach, engagement, and education with trade associations, with SBTi helping to educate associations on setting science-based targets and CAFA increasing its outreach through meetings, workshops, and webinars. The aim is to identify ways in which trade groups can engage with the SBTi.

SCIENCE & TECH

Fusion partners – The UK’s Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) has partnered with Eni to jointly conduct R&D on fusion energy. The partnership will kick off with construction of the world’s largest and most advanced tritium fuel cycle facility, a vital fuel for future fusion power stations. The “UKAEA-Eni H3AT Tritium Loop Facility”, located at Culham Campus near Oxford, will be complete in 2028. Tritium recovery and re-use will play a key role in the supply and generation of the fuel in future fusion power plants and will help to make the technology efficient. The partnership combines UKAEA’s expertise in fusion R&D with Eni’s established industrial-scale capabilities in plant engineering, commissioning, and operations.

Rock on – Rockfuel has unveiled a carbon-negative cement process by way of its carbon-neutral lime kiln, which efficiently produces quicklime (calcium oxide) while capturing CO2 emissions. The renewable-powered kiln works by heating limestone to produce quicklime while collecting and storing more than 500 cubic metres of hot CO2 per cubic metre of rock in a tank, reported agg-net. The captured CO2 is then repurposed within RockFuel’s carbon-negative cement production process. And once used in construction, the cement actively absorbs CO2, the company claims. Cement production accounts for an estimated 8% of CO2 emissions globally.

AND FINALLY…

Butterfly blues – A recently published study found a 22% decline in butterfly populations across the continental US from 2000 to 2020, based on data from over 76,000 surveys. Led by researchers from Michigan State University and the US Geological Survey Powell Centre, the study analysed records of more than 12.6 mln butterflies from 35 monitoring programmes. The findings indicate widespread declines across 554 species, with 107 species losing over half their populations. Scientists warn that this trend threatens biodiversity and essential ecosystem services, including pollination and nutrient cycling. The authors stress the urgent need for conservation measures at both local and national levels to reverse the decline.

The school was one of four schools hosted by Shannon Chamber in Dromoland Castle Hotel, where the executive chairman of Emerald Airlines and Dublin Aerospace, Conor McCarthy, was keynote speaker, and the general counsel of High Ridge Aviation, John Ludden, was posing the questions.

The schools were joined by 170 other participants, including representative of the many different segments of aviation and business.

Mr McCarthy responded to questions on a wide range of topics such as the traits needed to be a successful aviation entrepreneur; his future plans for Emerald Airlines and Dublin Aerospace; sustainable aviation fuel and the industry’s carbon reduction commitments; and what aviation might look like in 100 years.

He said aviation is one of the most exciting industries in the world, requiring dedication, faith, and trust and, while there may be many challenges, it’s a sector that offers enormous potential to anyone with a passion and interest in it.

Commenting on his future plans and whether Shannon features in those plans, he described Shannon as “an amazing airport that has achieved so much, not just in terms of the airport but in the cluster of aviation businesses now operating from Shannon”.

Responding to a question on the cap on passengers at Dublin Airport and the ability of Shannon and Cork airports to absorb the passenger overflow, he said that it would be “an extremely short-sighted strategy to build an airport on the back of another airport’s inability to cope in the short-term”.

“Shannon has amazing strengths, with great tourism products and

experiences on its doorstep. It has the capacity to drive its own future and should focus on this to continue to build on its success.” he stated.

He said that while the company has no plans to fly out of

Shannon, should an opportunity arise in the future to consider a poorly served airport in the UK, it would not be ruled out.

Shannon Chamber president, Eoin Gain, said that the Chamber is equally passionate about aviation, particularly the role it can play in attaining balanced regional development in Ireland.

He noted Shannon Airports critical link to economic activity and growth in the Mid West, and said the Chamber will “continue to call on the government to undertake a review of national aviation policy, and to permanently include Shannon Airport in the Regional Airports Programme”.

As we strive toward decarbonizing multiple sectors, aviation is one of the most challenging industries to decarbonize, also known as a sector that is hard to abate. In 2023, aviation was responsible for 2.5% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, growing faster between 2000 and 2019 than rail, road, or shipping, totaling almost 950 million metric tons of CO2. The aviation industry’s rapid growth in the face of increasing demand, along with the limitations of current technological advancements, means that its emissions continue to rise. Despite new aircraft being up to 20% more efficient than their predecessors, the sector’s growth consistently outpaces these improvements. Decarbonizing aviation to meet global climate goals requires stakeholders to significantly ramp up the adoption of low-carbon, sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), improve airframe and engine design, optimize operational efficiencies, and even explore demand restraint solutions [i].

Concentrating on technical solutions and given that retrofitting airplanes to run on electricity or batteries seems far from feasible in the near future, the quest for alternative fuels is essential. Key measures must be prioritized when seeking viable alternative/sustainable aviation fuels. High energy density can help meet lightweight requirements for aviation fuel and reduce refueling constraints for long air travel [ii]​. Engine and infrastructure compatibility can help ensure alternative fuels can blend with conventional jet fuel for widespread adoption. Lower emissions could allow SAFs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 94% [iii]. At the same time, flexibility could allow diverse feedstocks and production technologies to operate on the aviation fuel space [iv]; while safety [v] and cost-effectiveness are other pressing priorities [vi].​ Lastly, the availability and scalability of SAF fuels will be critical for a sector-wide change [vii].

Various production routes are being explored as the search for alternative fuels continues. These routes include the reverse water–gas shift, Fischer–Tropsch (RWGS-FT), methanol, and CO2 electrolysis routes. Each method utilizes intermediate compounds like syngas, methanol, and ethylene. Research indicates that the methanol route holds promise due to its relatively low energy intensity and high CO2 efficiency, achieving up to 92% CO2 efficiency when including recycle streams. The CO2 electrolysis route, while promising near 100% CO2 efficiency, faces significant challenges due to its high energy demands [viii].

Although these routes show promising potential, the journey towards sustainable aviation fuels is far from complete. There is still much to innovate and optimize, and each step forward requires collaboration between governments, industries, and researchers. Several members of the Green Chemistry for Sustainability network are helping lead innovation in this space.

Twelve, Air Company, and Infinium Holdings, Inc. are each developing SAF technologies. Twelve is developing CO₂ electrolysis-based fuels. Air Company is innovating in this space as well, using a non-toxic, non-rare Earth minerals catalysts for its CO₂ electrolysis based fuels, now working on scaling and looking at SAF applications. Infinium Holdings is innovating with three fuel types. The eSMR Reform™ solution uses electrification instead of gas-fired heat for steam methane reforming (SMR). The Synthesize™ system converts syngas into fuels and chemicals using a proprietary catalytic process reactor technology, and their proprietary catalytic. Finally, the React Syngas Solution turns CO₂ and green or blue hydrogen into low-carbon syngas.

The future of aviation will rely heavily on the development of these types of innovative SAFs that can meet the performance demands of flight and contribute to a more sustainable world. The potential for this sector to meet global emissions reduction targets is vast—but only if we continue to push the boundaries of innovation.

JetZero, a California-based company, is on a mission to develop a revolutionary blended-wing-body (BWB) aircraft that promises to slash fuel consumption, curb emissions, and quiet the roar of jet engines.

Unlike traditional aircraft, which have distinct cylindrical fuselages and protruding wings, BWB designs merge the two into a seamless, aerodynamic structure. The result? Reduced drag, greater fuel efficiency, and a significant step toward decarbonizing air travel.

While Delta isn’t injecting direct funding into JetZero, the airline offers something just as valuable—its vast operational expertise. Through its Sustainable Skies Lab incubator, Delta’s engineers will provide critical insights to support the design, development, and eventual test flight of JetZero’s demonstrator aircraft, targeted for 2027.

This collaboration aligns with Delta’s more significant environmental commitments. In 2020, the airline pledged $1 billion toward sustainability initiatives, aiming to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Two years later, Delta refined its mission, shifting focus from neutrality to full-scale decarbonization.

The advantages of BWB aircraft extend far beyond aesthetics. JetZero asserts that its cutting-edge design could cut emissions by up to 50%—all while utilizing existing engine technology and fuel infrastructure. The secret lies in its physics:

✔️ Less drag – A sleek, continuous body eliminates many inefficiencies in tube-and-wing airframes.

✔️ More lift, less weight – A broader surface area means improved lift distribution, allowing for a lighter airframe.

✔️ Quieter flights – With engines mounted on top rather than underneath, noise pollution is dramatically reduced.

Founded in 2021, JetZero envisions a next-generation 250-passenger aircraft comparable to midrange international jets. The startup has already secured a $235 million grant from the U.S. Air Force, teaming up with Northrop Grumman and Scaled Composites to construct and test the full-scale demonstrator.

Despite its promise, the BWB concept faces formidable hurdles. Emergency evacuations remain a concern—without the standard tube-and-row layout, ensuring quick and safe exits could be complex. Additionally, seating in a theatre-style arrangement may limit the number and placement of exit doors, raising regulatory questions.

While aerospace giants like Boeing, Airbus, and NASA have all experimented with BWB prototypes, none have successfully reached production. FAA certification remains a wild card, with regulatory unknowns looming over the aircraft’s future.

But Delta believes JetZero’s design presents a solution “within reach.”

“Working with JetZero to realize an entirely new airframe and experience for customers and employees is bold and important work to advance the airline industry’s fuel-saving initiatives and innovation goals,” said Amelia DeLuca, Delta’s chief sustainability officer, in a statement.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/becc64_32eebc5830a346f2bc1905d76fc3b40a~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_815,h_503,al_c,lg_1,q_85/becc64_32eebc5830a346f2bc1905d76fc3b40a~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-03-09 11:50:51.118532

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a renewable alternative to traditional jet fuel, produced from sources such as biomass, waste oils, municipal waste, and even carbon capture. SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional aviation fuel, making it a key component in decarbonizing the aviation industry. Read on to learn more about sustainable aviation fuel investment in 2025.

A Brief History of SAF

The concept of biofuels for aviation has been around since the early 2000s, with test flights using bio-based fuels as early as 2008. Over the past decade, airline commitments and government incentives have accelerated SAF adoption. In 2021, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) set a goal for the aviation industry to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, with SAF expected to account for 65% of the reduction. Today, major airlines, fuel producers, and governments are investing heavily in SAF production and infrastructure.

Why Invest in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in 2025?

Regulatory support and incentives – Governments worldwide are introducing tax credits, carbon pricing mechanisms, and blending mandates to boost SAF production.

Growing airline demand – Carriers such as United Airlines, Delta, and British Airways have signed long-term SAF supply agreements.

Technological advancements – New processes, including power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels and waste-to-fuel conversions, are making SAF production more scalable and cost-effective.

Carbon reduction commitments – Global climate targets are forcing airlines to integrate SAF into their fuel supply chains, driving long-term demand growth.

Key Investment Opportunities in SAF

The rapid expansion of the SAF sector has created compelling investment opportunities in companies developing innovative biofuel technologies and scaling production. Several key players are at the forefront of this transition, securing significant funding, government support, and airline partnerships to accelerate SAF adoption. Below are some of the most promising companies driving the future of sustainable aviation fuel.

Companies like Enerkem are developing facilities that convert biomass and non-recyclable materials into biofuels. Enerkem’s Varennes Carbon Recycling plant in Quebec, expected to be operational in 2025, will produce 125,000 tonnes of biofuels annually from 200,000 tonnes of waste.

Investing in SAF requires a strategic approach that takes into account policy shifts, market fluctuations, and emerging technologies. While government incentives and airline commitments are driving demand, challenges such as regulatory changes and supply chain disruptions could impact returns. By staying informed and monitoring industry trends, investors can position themselves to capitalize on the growing SAF market while mitigating potential risks.

Looking Forward: Sustainable Aviation Fuel Investments in 2025

Investing in SAF and biofuels presents a compelling opportunity in 2025, with Twelve, Gevo, and Calumet leading the charge. Government support and technological innovation continue to drive growth, but investors should remain vigilant about policy shifts, market fluctuations, and evolving competitive landscapes to make informed decisions.

All of these topics, and many more including circular business models and material innovation, will be discussed at our market-leading Drapers Conscious Fashion Summit and Awards at Hilton London Bankside on 12 March.","A commitment to driving conscious, responsible change is essential in creating a sustainable future for fashion retail.

We are five years into the critical decade in the fight against climate change and the fashion industry’s impact on the environment is growing.

Worldwide the fashion industry is responsible for 2%-8% of global greenhouse gasses, the United Nations reports, and last year the fashion sector emitted around 959 million metric tonnes of CO2 equivalents, Statista states. This is forecast to rise to more than 1.2 billion metric tonnes by 2030 without a concerted effort to reduce it.

As the third-largest clothing market in the world behind the US ($358.7bn/£293.2bn) and China ($328.5bn/£268.5bn), the UK plays a significant role: consumers spent $75.6bn (£61.8bn) on clothing in 2023 – up from $75.3bn (£61.6bn) in 2022.

Fashion retailers, brands and suppliers are rising to the immense challenge before them: sustainability now forms a vital part of businesses’ strategies, but as they battle increased costs and subdued consumer spend, there is a danger of it falling down the priority list. In our March issue, our conscious fashion special, we investigate how businesses are tackling a slew of new sustainability regulations, reducing the carbon footprint of their supply chains and adapting their strategies to build a responsible future, despite the wider economic headwinds.

Retailers are grappling to comply with a growing list of sustainability regulations. Three incoming European Union-wide regulations are the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) and the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR). Conforming to these – whether sooner or later – will be unavoidable for retailers and suppliers that trade in or with the bloc.

With this, and more, regulation coming in, retailers need to focus on improving supply chain traceability and data gathering as first steps. The UK is also expected to develop regulations that many in the industry hope will help level the playing field with the EU. As retailers put plans in place, some see upsides in greater transparency, but many say that more guidance and support is urgently needed from the government.

Freight and supply chain is another pain point for businesses aiming to reduce their carbon footprint as the methods retailers select to get their goods to, from and around the UK has huge implications for the environment. Shipping emits 10-40 grammes of carbon per metric tonne per kilometre, while air freight produces 500 grammes and is considerably more expensive. However, sometimes retailers have little choice: the Red Sea attacks on vessels by Houthi rebels from Yemen, which began in November 2023, have hit fashion retailers far and wide, including Matalan, Boohoo Group, Asos and Shoe Zone, causing many to switch to longer sea routes or air freight.

Despite rising costs, retailers are focused on working with partners to reduce carbon emissions and extending lead times to provide greater wriggle room in the face of disruptions. John Lewis, Primark and Marks & Spencer are among those investing in “greener” fuels for road fleets, while sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is an emerging technology for shipments that have to come by air.

All of these topics, and many more including circular business models and material innovation, will be discussed at our market-leading Drapers Conscious Fashion Summit and Awards at Hilton London Bankside on 12 March.

While a sharp increase in defence spending has won the Government political capital, few people have asked what it hopes to buy with the money.
The Government is acting as if reaching a spending target is a worthy achievement in itself.
On current trends, the extra 0.2 per cent of GDP that will take us to the 2.5 per cent target in 2027 equates to £6 billion.
As Healey pointed out in his dossier, the waste he identified in the MoD budget for 2019-20 alone would have paid for 79 extra tanks.","Even Labour's pacifists and nuclear disarmers have been mostly silent over Sir Keir Starmer's promise to boost Britain's defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2027 and to three per cent at some point in the next Parliament.

Russian aggression in Ukraine and Trump's seeming capitulation to Putin has meant that pacifism has gone out of fashion, with near universal agreement that the Armed Forces must now be rebuilt.

But does anyone really have confidence that the extra billions will be wisely spent? Not Defence Secretary John Healey, surely.

Speaking at the Institute for Government last month, he lamented that 'defence is mired in process and procedure', explaining: 'In procurement, we've got a situation where we employ 11 checkers for every one decision-maker, so no wonder it takes on average six years for a large programme simply to get onto contract.'

Three years ago, when he was shadowing his current post, he published a dossier exposing what he claimed to be £13 billion worth of waste by the MoD between 2010 and 2021.

He said that this 'uniquely failing department' had overspent £1 billion on four Astute nuclear submarines and a further £1 billion on a nuclear warhead assembly and disassembly plant near Reading.

Citing National Audit Office reports, he pointed out that the MoD had written off £595 million on a cancelled project to modernise and extend the life of 1980s Warrior armoured vehicles, managed to lose £21 million selling a mine hunter ship to Lithuania and wasted £4 million on an abandoned IT project.

It had even blown £5.7 million buying ear plugs, which turned out to be useless on the battlefield.

To his credit, Healey is clearly aware of the wastage, but it is far from clear what plans, if any, he has up his sleeve to ensure that the extra billions earmarked for the MoD do not similarly vanish down the plughole.

While a sharp increase in defence spending has won the Government political capital, few people have asked what it hopes to buy with the money.

Will it focus on more tanks, more aircraft, more submarines, more personnel? Is there going to be money for defending ourselves against cyber warfare? So far, there have been few answers.

The Government is acting as if reaching a spending target is a worthy achievement in itself. But by this thinking, there is no better way to ensure that money is wasted.

David Cameron's Coalition Government proved that when it set out to spend 0.7 per cent of UK GDP on international aid, a target that was supposed to boost our soft power. Soft in the head, more like.

It didn't take long before examples began to emerge of how the extra billions were being frittered – such as £13 million supporting a pop band called Yegna, otherwise known as the Ethiopian Spice Girls, who were supposed to be boosting women's rights in developing countries.

Charged with ensuring that the 0.7 per cent target was reached, civil servants in the now-defunct Department for International Development ended up shovelling money out of the door on whatever daft projects were dangled before them.

Similarly, there will be no shortage of snouts in the trough as the defence budget is increased.

On current trends, the extra 0.2 per cent of GDP that will take us to the 2.5 per cent target in 2027 equates to £6 billion.

That is a substantial sum, yet one that could easily be soaked up by a few pet projects that do little or nothing to keep the country safe.

There is, for example, the RAF's efforts to reach Net Zero by 2040. Why does the air force feel it necessary to eliminate its carbon emissions in just 15 years' time – a decade ahead of Britain's overall, reckless target to reach Net Zero by 2050? It is certainly spending many millions on the project.

The RAF boasts a Guinness World Record for the world's first light aircraft flight using only synthetic fuel, manufactured from hydrogen and carbon dioxide.

That was in 2021. Two years later, it started trials fuelling transport planes with a mixture of 50 per cent ordinary jet fuel and 50 per cent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

It is racing ahead of the airline industry's own efforts to reduce its carbon emissions.

The MoD's annual report doesn't reveal how much the RAF is spending on this noble-sounding exercise, but according to Johnson Matthey – a UK chemical company which manufactures SAF – such fuels cost between two and seven times as much as ordinary jet fuel.

Given that the Armed Forces spent a combined £445 million on fuel in 2023-24, it could end up costing well over an extra billion pounds a year if all our defence equipment was to run on sustainable fuels.

A House of Commons defence committee report in 2023 revealed that the Army had already spent £14 million on 'battlefield electrification' and had committed itself to spend a further £13 million on the cause.

It seems to mean building hybrid tanks and armoured vehicles rather than outright electric ones.

I am sure they are terribly clever, but still you wonder at the wisdom of it. Is, for example, the Army going to have stop an advance in order to recharge its tanks?

The US army has already experimented with a hybrid tank, which has ended up being the heaviest in the world, due to the weight of the battery.

The performance of the few that were sent to Ukraine was mixed, with some getting bogged down in mud and unable to cross bridges. Easy pickings for the Russians, who destroyed two-thirds of them.

Maybe synthetic fuels are the future and there is a case for the UK Government investing in their development. But why are our Armed Forces the guinea pigs for this research, and why is it being financed out of the defence budget?

The Government is effectively plundering money set aside for tanks, guns and soldiers to further its broader policy of tackling climate change. One thing is for sure: you can bet that Putin isn't diverting his military budget to Net Zero projects.

There is another voracious beast sure to poke its snout deeper into the MoD's trough: the equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) industry.

While Donald Trump has freed the US military – along with other federal departments – from having to bear of the cost of a battalion of EDI officials, the UK military has no such luck.

Just last week, the MoD was advertising for a 'diversity and inclusion learning and development professional' on a salary of £38,790, plus an extra 28 per cent in pension contributions.

A Freedom of Information request revealed that the MoD spent £2 million in 2023 on the salaries of EDI staff, more than double what it was spending four years earlier.

There is no greater danger in politics, the late Chancellor Lord (Nigel) Lawson once warned, than when a consensus emerges. It ensures that tricky issues are no longer debated, governments are not properly challenged. That is what we have at the moment.

There is widespread support for increasing the defence budget, but that shouldn't be allowed to detract from the need to ensure value for money.

As Healey pointed out in his dossier, the waste he identified in the MoD budget for 2019-20 alone would have paid for 79 extra tanks.

Without better procurement and a keener focus on what is important, there is no guarantee that an extra £6 billion will buy us more effective forces.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/08/22/95990403-0-image-a-93_1741471975932.jpg,N,,2025-03-08 21:50:09.267476

The ICCT study concludes that 81 per cent of FFL revenues would come from this cohort.","That’s exactly the reaction that the Climate Change Committee (CCC) is seeking. The statutory body, established to advise the government on emissions reductions, now believes that the introduction of an incremental tax targeting those who fly the most is one of the best ways for aviation to achieve net zero by 2050.

In its Seventh Carbon Budget, published last month, the CCC says that “the cost of decarbonising aviation should be reflected in the cost to fly”, and while no nation has yet imposed an FFL, a model proposed by researchers at the London School of Economics offers an idea of what we can expect.

Your first flight in any year would be exempt from the levy and your second flight would incur an FFL of, say, £50 per tonne of CO₂ emitted. So if that second flight of the year was an economy return to Marrakesh, for example, emitting 0.86 tonnes of CO₂, you would expect to pay an FFL of £43 in addition to the airfare — adding £172 to the bill for a family of four, but not dissimilar to a voluntary offsetting fee.

For your third flight in any 12-month period you’d pay £100 per tonne — adding, for example, £1,100 to the cost of a business-class return to Cape Town, rated at 11.1 tonnes. Your fourth flight would be chargeable at £150 per tonne, and so on.

While previous administrations have acted upon much of the CCC’s advice, there is no obligation to do so. This is a proposal, and there’s no indication for when this could be introduced. But the recommendations could herald the dawn of a long-dreaded day of reckoning for the airline industry.

Aviation is now the sixth worst UK offender in terms of greenhouse-gas emissions after road transport, construction, industry, agriculture and electricity supply. But while those sectors are decarbonising fast, airlines remain dependent on fossil fuels.

• How to book holidays like a travel expert

At present flying accounts for 8 per cent of total emissions. Without intervention that share will be 27 per cent by 2040 and aviation will be the nation’s top polluter. For a government that launched the Jet Zero strategy in January — committing to reduce aviation emissions to net zero by 2050 — then embarked on an airport expansion spree in the naive belief that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a magic potion allowing growth at no environmental cost, this is more than a bit awkward. It shows just how far Labour’s view of the airline industry is from reality.

The snake-oil promises that technology would provide a painless transition to zero-carbon travel are unravelling fast, and now the CCC is saying what scientists and analysts already knew: that “managing forecast demand growth” — that is, putting us off flying — is now the most effective way of keeping a lid on spiralling emissions.

That’s because SAF is nothing like the “game changer” that the chancellor has told us it is. First, jet fuel made from biomass, recycled chip oil or electrolysed CO₂ is not emission free. Yes, the manufacturing process involves reduced greenhouse gas, but when it’s burnt in a jet engine SAF releases climate-changing carbon into the atmosphere just like fossil fuels.

Second, a Norwegian study shows that SAF will account for only 12 per cent of global aviation demand by 2050, so it can only supplement rather than replace kerosene. The UK government, though, expects biofuels to comprise 22 per cent of what’s in the tank by 2040, and if that target is reached overall emissions could drop by 16 per cent based on 2024 levels. But according to the CCC, passenger traffic will be up by the same amount by then, so net emissions will remain the same — and 78 per cent of them will still be from fossil fuels.

Third, growing feedstock for biofuels takes land away from food production. Ploughing up new areas to grow food crops releases stored carbon, and a 2021 study by the International Council on Clean Transportation concludes that these emissions “undermine any greenhouse-gas savings from these fuels”.

• British Airways frequent flyer scheme changes: everything you need to know

As for all-electric flights, trials will begin within five years, using light aircraft on multiple-stop, short-haul routes. Battery-powered long-haul is at least a generation away.

In the meantime, beating us away from airports with a blunt financial instrument seems to be the best way to reduce emissions, although the CCC offers four options.

Airlines could be told to invest more in SAF production. There’s only one plant in the UK and its 50-million-litre output represents less than 0.5 per cent of the aviation fuel required this year. If airlines can’t find enough SAF to meet government requirements they face fines of £4.70 per litre for any shortfall.

Alternatively, the government could charge duty on fossil fuel — as crazy as it seems, Jet A-1 fuel is tax free. Air-passenger duty could be also increased to the point of deterrence. But all the above mean higher prices for all flyers, regardless of how many flights we take per year.

The FFL is the fourth option, and even the fiercest defenders of gold-card status would be hard-pressed to disagree that this scheme is the most just. The UK Civil Aviation Authority estimates that only 51 per cent of the country’s population flies in any year and 59 per cent of those passengers take three flights or fewer a year.

Internationally, research by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) notes that the 2 per cent who take more than six overseas flights a year are responsible for 40 per cent of emissions. The ICCT study concludes that 81 per cent of FFL revenues would come from this cohort.

So it seems fairest that those who can afford to fly the most should pay the most, while the families taking one flight a year for the summer holidays should remain exempt.

What happens to the frequent flyers’ clubs in this scenario remains to be seen. Members — or their employers — already pay handsomely for points and privileges, but how much more would they be willing to cough up?

Fostering the agriculture, technology, and energy sectors must be a priority, as these three industries will dominate global markets and shape the future of business. Pakistan, with its immense potential, must seize opportunities by developing pragmatic strategies without delay, energy scientists and economic experts said.

Speaking to The Express Tribune, they said that economic development is impossible without promoting these three vital sectors. Agriculture plays a crucial role in human survival, strengthening food securityan issue far more critical than border security. It also generates employment in rural areas, preventing mass migration to urban centres.

Technology enhances communication, efficiency, innovation, connectivity, and overall quality of life while driving advancements across all industries. Meanwhile, the energy sector powers homes, offices, industries, and transportation, reducing inefficiencies and improving productivity.

To address economic and labour challenges through technological advancements, DHA Suffa University Karachi's Dean of the Faculty of Computing and Information Technology, Professor Dr S Zafar Nasir, stated that Pakistan can leapfrog into the global technological landscape by leveraging its young workforce. This can be achieved through internet-based connectivity and knowledge-sharing with professionals and experts from universities worldwide.

He highlighted that Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption could transform Pakistan's economy, provided there are AI-focused education and training programmes. Encouraging AI startups through funding, incubation, and mentorship opportunities could further accelerate progress.

""Our agriculture sector has been a major source of foreign exchange for some time. By utilising data analytics techniques, we can significantly enhance per-acre yields through soil analysis while conserving precious water reserves in delta regions,"" Nasir explained. ""Additionally, AI-based solutions can improve traffic management and energy efficiency.""

He also underscored the importance of incentivising Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption by offering tax breaks and subsidies while investing in EV infrastructure. Encouraging ride-hailing services to transition to EVs and attracting foreign investment in local EV production would further boost the sector.

Other innovative ideas include prioritising renewable energy by investing in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, thereby reducing dependence on fossil fuels. Additionally, fintech and digital payment systems, including online banking, should be promoted alongside local e-commerce platforms and digital marketplaces. ""Informed decision-making is the key to unlocking potential markets and capitalising on market dynamics,"" he added.

Nasir urged the government to support and finance startups and entrepreneurs through funding, mentorship, and incubation programmes.

""By adopting dynamic strategies, Pakistan can harness technological trends to drive economic growth, improve living standards, and emerge as a significant global player,"" he said.

Energy scientist Dr Adeel Ghayur, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Allied Biorefinery, Australia, pointed out that reliable and affordable energy is crucial for attracting foreign investment, boosting industrial output, and fostering technological advancements. A stable energy sector can help resolve Pakistan's chronic power shortages, which frequently disrupt economic activity and daily life.

He highlighted the job creation potential of the energy sector across industries such as construction, maintenance, manufacturing, services, and research & development (R&D).

""In its transition towards energy security and renewable energy sources, Pakistan should prioritise the development of biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, green diesel, and bio-dimethyl ether (a viable LPG replacement),"" Dr Ghayur suggested. ""Additionally, the country should explore distributed energy, which involves generating electricity from decentralised sources closer to the point of use, reducing transmission losses and costs.""

He also noted that AI and data centreswhich require substantial energyare increasingly prioritising renewable sources. Pakistan has a prime opportunity to capitalise on this demand by promoting green energy, positioning itself as a key player in the AI sector while simultaneously strengthening its renewable energy industry.

Veteran agriculturalist Nabi Bux Sathio urged the government to end the exploitation of farmers by establishing a transparent pricing mechanism to ensure stability and a 15-20% profit margin beyond production costs for every crop.

""Local growers are being deprived of fair compensation for their produce. Agriculture is the only sector that guarantees 100% food security,"" Sathio stated. ""If farmers are assured they will recover their costs and earn reasonable profits, they will naturally work toward increasing crop yields. Higher yields will not only benefit the country's food supply but also boost exports.""

He warned that food insecurity would cause people to prioritise purchasing essential commodities over other expenses, leading to panic buying and economic disruption.

""Investing in agricultural R&D is no longer an optionit is a necessity,"" he asserted.

Sathio stressed that developed countries are achieving higher crop yields by focusing on safe and sustainable food production, ensuring pest-free, disease-free, and 100% hygienic food for their populations. Pakistan must follow suit to secure its agricultural future.",https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/smart-farming1741470041-0/smart-farming1741470041-0.jpeg,N,,2025-03-08 17:50:16.844037

The adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by Vietnam Airlines helps strengthen its standing in the international aviation sector.
By encouraging environmentally friendly travel, Vietnam Airlines' choice of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) significantly increases Vietnam tourism business.","Established in 1956, Vietnam Airlines has evolved from a regional operator into a prominent global carrier. The airline was the first in Southeast Asia to introduce the Airbus A350 XWB in 2015, demonstrating its commitment to modernizing its fleet and enhancing passenger comfort.

Vietnam Airlines has implemented various initiatives to reduce its carbon footprint in line with global environmental standards. Notably, in the first nine months of 2024, the airline reduced CO₂ emissions by 75,000 tons through fuel-saving measures.

The aviation industry is increasingly adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to mitigate environmental impacts. SAF, derived from sources like waste oils and non-food crops, can reduce CO₂ emissions by up to 80%. This shift reflects a broader trend toward greener practices in air travel.

Sustainable Fuels Initiative At Vietnam Airlines

Vietnam Airlines has become the first Vietnamese carrier to implement sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on all flights departing from Europe, starting 1 January 2025. This initiative begins with a minimum 2% SAF blend to enhance air quality and support global sustainability goals.

The airline plans to increase SAF usage to 6% by 2030, 20% by 2035, and 70% by 2050. For flights from the United Kingdom, a 2% SAF blend will start in 2025, rising to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040. This strategy aligns with Vietnam's commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

While SAF is currently more expensive than traditional jet fuel, Vietnam Airlines is committed to absorbing the additional costs, estimated at approximately $4.8 million annually, for its European network. This investment reflects the airline's dedication to environmental responsibility and providing eco-friendly travel options for passengers.

Impact of Vietnam Airlines Sustainable Fuels Application

By committing to sustainable fuels, Vietnam Airlines is raising the standard. This project increases its environmental credentials and follows international green aviation patterns. Find out how this innovative action is changing the travel and aviation sectors.

The adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by Vietnam Airlines helps strengthen its standing in the international aviation sector. By incorporating SAF into its European flights, the airline demonstrates its dedication to environmental responsibility and aligns with international sustainability criteria. This proactive approach raises its brand image and sets standards for other regional competitors.

Although SAF has more expenses, its use helps Vietnam Airlines to stand out in the very competitive aviation industry. The airline expects SAF use on European flights to cause an annual rise in running expenses of about $4.8 million. However, this expenditure shows a calculated response to changing customer expectations and environmental rules, therefore guaranteeing long-term operational sustainability.

By encouraging environmentally friendly travel, Vietnam Airlines' choice of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) significantly increases Vietnam tourism business. Attracting environmentally conscious tourists and improving the nation's reputation as a green destination, this project fits the worldwide trend toward low-carbon travel.

By up to 80% throughout the lifetime of the fuel, SAF lowers carbon emissions, improving the air quality and the surroundings. This environmental dedication draws visitors looking for eco-friendly travel choices and motivates nearby businesses to follow green policies, promoting a sustainable tourism industry.

Prices two to six times greater than those of conventional fuels make sustainable fuels still expensive. Vietnam Airlines still invests in environmentally friendly solutions that might have long-term advantages. More foreign guests and green tourism investment follow from a stronger dedication to sustainability.

The green shift of aviation depends critically on Vietnam Airlines' choice of sustainable fuel. This program helps environmentally friendly travel and lowers emissions. Sustainability is likely to become the norm as airlines choose greener energy sources, therefore transforming the global aviation sector by responsibility.

The company aims to scale its user base and technological capabilities globally.

MENA funding grows fivefold in Feb

Investment in MENA startups surged nearly fivefold in February, reaching $494 million across 58 deals, according to Wamda.

The sharp increase was driven by a shift from debt financing, which fell to 15 percent of total funding compared to 90 percent in January. Excluding debt, equity investments rose 371 percent month-on-month.

Saudi Arabia led with $250.3 million across 25 deals, followed by the UAE with $203.5 million from 15 deals and Egypt with $27.5 million across eight transactions. Smaller investments were recorded in Oman, Morocco, and Jordan, as well as Tunisia, Bahrain, and Qatar.

Fintech dominated with $274 million across 15 deals, followed by insurance tech with $55 million, and logistics with $28.5 million.

Marketing tech, education tech, AI, and clean tech also saw significant funding.

Later-stage rounds gained traction, with Tabby securing $160 million in Series E funding, Flow48 raising $69 million, and Applied AI closing $55 million.

Despite the funding surge, gender disparity persisted, with female-founded startups receiving just $200k — 0.04 percent of total investment — while male-led ventures secured 86.7 percent of funding.

RIYADH: From advanced technology to bustling tourism, Saudi Arabia is witnessing a labor market transformation that is reducing its reliance on oil and creating jobs in construction, green energy, and beyond.

Government initiatives such as the Saudi Nationalization Scheme and Nitaqat initiative have played a pivotal role in shaping the labor market landscape.

These policies have encouraged private sector employers to hire more of the Kingdom’s nationals across various industries, leading to a significant reduction in unemployment rates.

The commitment to enhancing workforce participation has also contributed to a more inclusive job market, while a strategic focus on developing a knowledge-based economy has led to increased investments in education and vocational training programs.

These initiatives are equipping the local workforce with the skills required to thrive in sectors such as advanced manufacturing, healthcare, and financial services, further accelerating employment growth.

Construction boom fuels job creation

The construction and infrastructure sector has experienced exponential growth in recent years, underpinning the Kingdom’s economic expansion, with contract awards in 2024 reaching $146.8 billion, a record high as it overtook 2023’s figure of $118.7 billion, according to Kamco Invest’s GCC Projects Market Update.

The report added that Saudi Arabia accounted for over 53.8 percent of total project awards across the Gulf Cooperation Council in 2024.

Sachin Kerur, managing partner of Middle East at Reed Smith, told Arab News that this boom is leading to a rise in the opportunities for project managers, designers, architects and many other construction professionals.

“Anyone studying Vision 2030 or visiting the important cities of the Kingdom will be very aware of the construction of large-scale housing, rail and road networks, new airports, infrastructure for major sporting events and industrial production plants,” Kerur said. Tourism-related construction has also seen a surge, with new hotels and resorts hiring more Saudi nationals. “Anyone visiting the Kingdom’s hotels of late will have noticed the number of Saudi nationals employed,” Kerur added.

Major projects such as the Rua Al-Madinah and Qiddiya are further fueling demand for skilled labor in the sector.

Tourism as a booster

The tourism sector continues to play a pivotal role in shaping Saudi Arabia’s labor market, and is only set to grow as the Kingdom pushes ahead with its aim to attract 150 million visitors annually by 2030. As a result, the demand for hospitality, transportation, and cultural service jobs is rapidly increasing.

“With millions of visitors anticipated to visit Saudi each year, tourism has one of the fastest growing and elastic demand for employment,” Kerur said.

From religious tourism initiatives in Makkah and Madinah to entertainment-driven projects such as the Red Sea Project, the sector’s expansion is creating thousands of jobs for Saudis.

Technology and green energy sectors see expansion

On a tech front, Saudi Arabia’s technology sector is experiencing unprecedented growth, driven by the government’s investments and incentives for global tech firms.

“Foreign investments are driving significant job creation in Saudi Arabia’s emerging industries, particularly technology and innovation, aligning with Vision 2030’s goals of economic diversification and private sector growth,” said Faisal Al-Sarraj, Saudi Arabia’s deputy country senior partner at PwC Middle East.

He continued: “PIF’s focus on technology and innovation has bolstered local employment, particularly in AI, digital transformation, and data analytics. Its support for startups and partnerships with global tech firms is strengthening local expertise.”

Initiatives such as the $100 billion AI and data analytics initiative, known as Project Transcendence, as well as smart city projects including NEOM, are fostering high-skilled employment in advanced fields.

Foreign investments are driving significant job creation in Saudi Arabia’s emerging industries.

Faisal Al-Sarraj, Saudi Arabia’s deputy country senior partner at PwC Middle East.

Citing media outlets Bloomberg and CIO, Al-Sarraj said: “This $100 billion plan positions Saudi Arabia as a global AI and data analytics hub, creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and rivaling regional tech leaders.”

The green energy sector is also taking off in Saudi Arabia, bringing a fresh wave of job opportunities and supporting the Kingdom’s sustainability goals.

Solar and wind farms are being developed across the country, creating thousands of new roles and giving locals the chance to dive into the world of clean energy.

Kerur also cited the life sciences and food industries as other sectors that have seen employment growth.

Saudi welcoming the world

The government’s Saudization initiatives, particularly the Nitaqat program which was established in June 2011, have played a crucial role in increasing the number of nationals in the private sector.

“Many commentators regard Saudization as having been most successful in the retail and tourism and hospitality sectors,” Kerur said.

He continued: “Perhaps less success has been achieved in areas such as life sciences, medicine and design and construction where more skilled resources are needed. That is certainly an area of development for the next few years.”

Moreover, the drive for greater workforce inclusion is also reflected in the increasing focus on supporting female participation in the labor market.

As more opportunities arise in flexible and remote work arrangements, women are stepping into roles across diverse sectors, contributing to the Kingdom’s broader economic transformation goals.

Figures released by the General Authority for Statistics showed that by the end of the third quarter of 2024 the labor force participation rate of Saudi females reached 36.2 percent — well above the original Vision 2030 target of 30 percent, with that goal now upped to 40 percent by the end of the decade.

Kerur added: “Saudi Arabia’s labor market reforms and initiatives are successfully reducing unemployment levels and so much credit must go to Vision 2030 as economic diversification develops at pace. However, this is not merely labour economics.”

He went on to say: “As with other GCC countries like the UAE, there are social and cultural norms that have to be assessed to ensure they are maintained whilst at the same time ensuring unemployment is minimised and the national workforce is equipped for the challenges of the next three decades.”

Regional Headquarters Initiative and FDI

One of the biggest wins for Saudi Arabia in 2024 was the success of its regional headquarters initiative, which has drawn in over 540 multinational companies to set up shop in the Kingdom.

This surge in corporate presence is not just about numbers — it is about turning Saudi Arabia into a thriving business hub, buzzing with new ideas and opportunities.

Companies such as Amazon, Google, PwC, and Deloitte have relocated their regional headquarters, leading to job creation in professional services, consulting, and administrative roles.

“This achievement is having an employment impetus as more and more companies are employing Saudi nationals in line with the Kingdom’s status as a developing business hub,” Kerur said.

The Kingdom’s push to attract foreign investment has not only created job opportunities but also fostered knowledge transfer and skill development among the local workforce.

With multinational firms bringing global best practices and expertise, Saudi nationals are gaining invaluable exposure to international business operations, positioning them competitively in the job market.

Another key initiative was the Golden Visa, which allows foreign nationals to live, work, and own property in the Kingdom without a sponsor,

In order to qualify, applicants must meet specific criteria such as significant investments in real estate or business ventures.

Al-Sarraj said the visa “incentivized” highly skilled professionals and entrepreneurs to relocate to Saudi Arabia, and has expanded employment in sectors such as healthcare, education, and technology, and fostered a knowledge-based economy.

He added: “Reforms like the Labor Reform Initiative improved mobility and flexibility for expatriates, making Saudi Arabia a more attractive job market. This policy also encouraged Saudization, driving the hiring of skilled nationals.”

Challenges and the road ahead

Despite the progress, challenges remain in bridging skill gaps and positioning manual labor or skilled trades as a viable career path for Saudis.

“Education and training will be vital all round for the labor market. Indeed more labor capacity is required to implement Vision 2030 projects and this provides Saudi nationals a significant opportunity to develop blue collar skills,” Kerur said.

He continued: “Of course the private sector, both national and international, will have a key role to play to train, develop and employ nationals. The issue will be the stick or the carrot.”

Kerur further explained that the private sector in Saudi Arabia will require support and assistance, particularly in areas where their capacity to operate or expand is currently limited, and where significant financial investment is needed.

“Saudi Arabia has shown a willingness to enable public private partnership in their labor market and more will be expected in this regard,” he said.

According to Al-Sarraj, one of the key issues is that many workers may not have received the necessary training and or hold the qualifications required by employers.

“Despite significant progress, challenges remain, including skill gaps among the workforce, the need for enhanced educational and vocational training programs, and ensuring sustainable employment opportunities for the growing local population,” he said.

Al-Sarraj added: “Employers often cite skill gaps and higher wage expectations as reasons for not hiring Saudis, highlighting the need for enhanced educational and vocational training programs.”

As Saudi Arabia’s labor market continues to evolve, the combined impact of strategic government initiatives, foreign investment, and workforce development efforts will be key to sustaining momentum.

With significant achievements in 2023 paving the way, the Kingdom is well-positioned to achieve its ambitious Vision 2030 objectives and create a dynamic, diversified workforce that meets future economic demands.

JEDDAH: Saudi Arabia’s unveiling of a new symbol for the riyal has been dubbed a “visionary maneuver” that will enhance the currency’s global recognition, strengthen investor confidence, and signal a commitment to financial modernization, Arab News has been told.

As the Kingdom seeks to position itself as a global financial hub, this new symbol, inspired by Arabic calligraphy, reflects a seamless blend of tradition and progress — key to the nation’s ongoing economic reform efforts, according to experts.

It was announced on Feb. 20 that the symbol had been approved by King Salman, a move dubbed as marking “a new chapter in the evolution of our national currency” by the Saudi Central Bank.

The symbol, which blends Arabic calligraphy with the name of the national currency, will be used in financial and commercial transactions both within the Kingdom and internationally.

According to the central bank, also known as SAMA, the symbol will be rolled out immediately, with its integration into financial and commercial transactions, as well as various applications, occurring gradually in coordination with relevant entities.

Tamer Al-Sayed, chief financial officer at FII (Future Investment Initiative) Institute, told Arab News the timing aligned with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030-driven economic transformation to become a global financial hub.

“This announcement comes at a time when the world is facing economic volatility — rising inflation, shifting interest rates, and evolving global trade dynamics. In such an environment, having a distinct and recognizable currency identity is more important than ever,” he said.

In response to a question about how the new symbol might impact its recognition and credibility in global financial markets, Youssef Saidi, a research fellow at the Economic Research Forum and former senior economic adviser at the Gulf Monetary Council, said that the introduction of the symbol was a “visionary maneuver.”

He added that a modern symbol could present Saudi Arabia as a forward-thinking nation, positively influencing both the country’s image and the perception of its currency globally.

This could increase investor confidence in the Saudi market, potentially leading to greater foreign direct investment.

For foreign investors, Saidi said, the introduction of a new symbol may signal Saudi Arabia’s commitment to aligning its financial practices with international standards. “This could increase investor confidence in the Saudi market, potentially leading to greater foreign direct investment,” he said.

Saidi noted that a single, recognizable symbol would streamline monetary transactions, reduce errors, and boost global awareness of the Saudi riyal.

“Just as the dollar, euro, and yen are instantly recognizable, a unique symbol design for the Saudi riyal, ingeniously inspired by authentic Arabic calligraphy, could help it stand out in financial documents, trading platforms, and media coverage,” Saidi added.

FII Institute’s Al-Sayed agreed, stating that the symbol comes as Saudi Arabia is making significant investments in its financial infrastructure, from digital payment systems to foreign investment attraction.

“A strong, well-defined riyal symbol reinforces these efforts, signaling economic stability and modernization to global investors,” Al-Sayed said. Commenting on incorporating Arabic letters in the design, the FII Institute official emphasized that this was an important point because the use of the calligraphy is more than just an artistic choice — it’s a message.

“Saudi Arabia has always played a central role in the Arab and Islamic world, and its leadership understands that its identity is not separate from its economic growth,” he said.

Al-Sayed noted that using Arabic script in the riyal’s symbol is a statement that modernization does not mean abandoning tradition.

“In fact, the most successful economies balance heritage with progress. Take Japan, for example — it leads in global innovation while maintaining its cultural identity. Saudi Arabia is following a similar path, blending financial modernization with deep-rooted traditions,” he added.

He further said that the new riyal symbol is not just a visual element, claiming that it is a declaration that Saudi Arabia’s financial identity is “here to stay — both locally and globally.” Asked how the symbol can help Saudi Arabia strengthen its position on the global economic stage, Al-Sayed said that the world was moving toward a more digital and borderless economy and currencies were no longer just physical notes. “Currencies are financial identities recognized across global markets, digital transactions, and potential future digital currencies,” he added.

A strong, well-defined riyal symbol reinforces these efforts, signaling economic stability and modernization to global investors.

Tamer Al-Sayed, chief financial officer at FII Institute

Al-Sayed noted that a strong riyal symbol is a strategic move because it boosts global confidence in Saudi Arabia’s economy, particularly among foreign investors and financial institutions that rely on strong monetary symbols to assess stability.

He continued: “It also increases the riyal’s visibility in global trade and financial markets, potentially enhancing its role in international contracts and energy deals — an essential factor given Saudi Arabia’s influence in oil and renewable energy markets.”

Al-Sayed added that the symbol strengthens the riyal’s presence in the digital financial ecosystem, emphasizing that digital payments and the potential adoption of cryptocurrency make distinct monetary symbols increasingly important.

“This is not just a branding exercise — it’s a step toward redefining Saudi Arabia’s financial standing in a rapidly changing global economy,” he said.

The Economic Research Forum’s Saidi agreed that a distinct currency symbol had an important role to play in today’s digital and globalized economy.

Saidi pointed out that the digitalization of currencies had transformed the traditional concept of money, with currency symbols now representing both physical and digital forms of legal tender.

“In the digital economy, currency symbols aren’t just graphic representations but additionally play a pivotal part in easing trades, ensuring financial sovereignty, and affirming financial stability,” he added.

He said that the design of the new symbol highlighted Saudi Arabia’s rich cultural heritage. This not only fosters national pride and cultural affiliation but also strengthens confidence in the riyal as a stable and influential currency on the global stage.

“Domestically, the introduction of a new Saudi riyal symbol could foster a sense of national pride and unity around the currency. This could translate into greater public support for economic reforms and policies aimed at strengthening the riyal,” Saidi added.

JEDDAH: Franchises are proving increasingly vital to Saudi Arabia’s economic development, driving employment, government revenue, and cultural transformation in a youthful nation.

Economic experts have told Arab News that the introduction of a law in 2019, followed by expansion of regulations the following year, helped open the Kingdom up to international businesses, as well as strengthened the relationship between franchisors and franchisees.

These moves, together with the economic expansion of Saudi Arabia as part of the Vision 2030 initiative, means the Kingdom now accounts for nearly half of the $30 billion franchise market in the Middle East and Africa, according to Yaseen Ghulam, associate professor of economics at Riyadh-based Al-Yamamah University.

He told Arab News there is consensus among researchers and industry observers that franchise businesses are expected to grow by more than 20 percent per annum for the coming five years and beyond.

“This presents an exceptional opportunity for international brands to enter the Kingdom through franchising, given the fact that European and North American consumer markets are struggling due to economic uncertainty, unemployment, and higher cost of living,” Ghulam said.

He added that franchise registrations in the Kingdom stood at 1,788 by the end of the third quarter of 2024, up from just 185 three years earlier.

With 1,232 entries, the accommodation and food services sector — which includes lodging facilities, dining establishments, and enterprises associated with tourism — led the registrations, the associate professor said.

He added that the wholesale and retail division came in second with 689, and the transport and storage sector with 257. An important element of this development, he noted, is more widespread activity, covering almost all major cities, rather than clustered around one particular region or sector.

“With 647 franchise registrations, Riyadh has led the field, followed by Makkah with 363, and the Eastern Province with 225. According to some estimates, over 1,200 brands are available for franchising, and the franchising sector in Saudi Arabia is offering over 10,000 business opportunities.”

Ghulam noted that more than 600 international and 380 local franchise brands are present in the Kingdom, according to the Small and Medium Enterprises General Authority, known as Monsha’at.

Abdullah Al-Maghlouth, a member of the Saudi Economic Association, told Arab News that government support for SMEs through streamlined processes and a business-friendly environment has helped drive the franchise sector.

He added that the 2019 law bolstered the Kingdom’s business ecosystem, attracting local and international investments through a clear legal framework.

“The 2020 executive regulations complement this by providing a comprehensive legal environment that facilitates franchise operations and ensures guarantees for all parties involved. This enhances transparency between franchisors and franchisees, making the Saudi market increasingly appealing to investors,” Al-Maghlouth said.

Reflecting on the key factors driving growth in the sector in the Kingdom, Ghulam said Monsha’at’s Franchise Center is “aggressively advancing entrepreneurship” through different programs, such as Tomoh.

He added that trademarks are now fully protected thanks to the Kingdom’s recent successful implementation of an intellectual property rights plan, with online portals making trademark registration and protection simple and accessible.

Financial guarantees provided by the Kafalah program are also proving to be a factor in sourcing finance from local investors, Ghulam said, and he noted that the Social Development Bank has played a significant role in advancing franchising in the Kingdom.

The institution provides financing solutions ranging from SR150,000 ($40,000) to SR4 million with a maximum financing length of 8 years as part of its program to assist new franchise developments and expansion.

“Another significant step in bolstering the franchise community is the founding of the Saudi Franchise Association, the Kingdom’s first specialized association. It has worked to promote the idea and culture of business excellence since its foundation. Additionally, it has organized numerous seminars and workshops and signed various partnerships with colleges and chambers of commerce,” said Ghulam.

Arrangements are also in place in Saudi Arabia to support franchise business and provide consulting. For both domestic and international businesses, Arab Franchise Marketing Corporation provides media platforms, administrative and legal services, and new franchise opportunities. “Through useful solutions, they work with a profit system to grow the franchise market in the MENA area, especially in Saudi Arabia,” said the associate professor.

Highlighting how Saudi Vision 2030 has influenced the development of the franchise market, Ghulam said that the objectives of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 are to invest in globally competitive industries, diversify the country’s economy, boost the private sector, and create jobs.

“Following this, one important economic area that is highlighted in Vision 2030 is franchising. For the success of the Vision, a comprehensive legal, regulatory, financial, and economic set up was needed and has been established for the promotion of the private sector to diversify the economy and reduce dependence on the oil sector,” he said.

The development, he added, of the basic and changed framework has indeed helped the private sector grow in the last few years.

Ghulam said that the franchising industry has greatly benefited from Vision 2030, with support mechanisms, new institutions, and financial aid serving as key enablers.

He added that investment in mega projects, sports events, and facilities has created youth employment, raised real wages, and driven demand for sectors like education, health, dining, beauty, and fitness.

This has attracted international franchisors and local investors, fueling significant growth in the sector.

Ghulam emphasized that Vision 2030 has also shifted the mindset of Saudi youth, encouraging private sector roles and self-employment through franchising, offering substantial returns on investment.

He advised foreign brands seeking to expand into the Saudi franchise market that there is significant potential in sectors such as food, retail, and education, as well as health, fitness, and sports.

“More specifically, customers are quite fond of education franchises, including both domestic and international franchises that focus on training, early childhood care, development centers, and tutoring,” Ghulam said.

He continued that Saudi Arabia’s focus on health-related industries has driven high demand for gyms, nutritious food franchises, and medical services, adding that loosened social regulations, particularly for women, and government support for regional designers have boosted the retail sector, particularly fashion.

Al-Maghlouth agreed that beyond traditional sectors like tourism, hospitality, and food, the Saudi franchise market will continue to expand into emerging fields such as technology, education, and healthcare.

“The supportive legal framework will continue to enhance market transparency and drive growth in economic activities, fostering a sustainable investment environment. This will not only benefit all stakeholders but also solidify Saudi Arabia’s position as a leading investment destination in the region.” he said.

RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s corporate venture capital arms are playing a pivotal role in driving innovation and advancing economic diversification by aligning their investment strategies with both national and corporate objectives.

Between 2020 and the third quarter of 2024, corporate investors accounted for 27 percent of the 1,361 unique investors in the Middle East and North Africa region, deploying approximately $380 million, according to a report by MAGNiTT.

Saudi Arabia saw the highest ratio, with CVC’s making up 30 percent of local unique investors.

Funds such as Aramco Ventures and stc’s tali ventures exemplify this dual-purpose approach. By leveraging their resources and expertise, these CVCs are fostering startups that align with the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 agenda while simultaneously advancing the strategic and operational goals of their parent companies.

According to Stephane Ulcakar, associate director and head of corporate and government financial services at Arthur D. Little, these funds stand out due to their scale and strategic scope.

“Aramco Ventures recently secured an additional $4 billion in funding, raising its total capital to $7 billion,” Ulcakar noted in an interview with Arab News, adding that stc has also collaborated with global players like SoftBank and the Saudi Public Investment Fund to broaden its reach.

This alignment extends to specific investment sectors. In an interview with Arab News, Arjun Singh, partner and global head of fintech at ADL, explained: “These arms — and their affiliated funds — are not just looking for the next big thing but also for startups that can integrate seamlessly into their parent companies’ operations.”

Stc’s tali ventures prioritizes fintech, artificial intelligence, and blockchain, reflecting both the nation’s and its parent company’s ambitions to champion Saudi Arabia’s digital economy.

Similarly, Aramco’s Wa’ed Ventures focuses on startups that advance the Kingdom’s digital transformation while complementing Aramco’s strategic objectives.

Beyond funding, Saudi CVCs bring a distinct set of advantages to startups by leveraging industry expertise, supply chain networks, and expansive ecosystems.

Ulcakar highlighted the role of national initiatives such as the PIF’s National Development Strategy in addressing supply chain gaps and reshaping logistics.

Startups backed by these CVCs gain access to infrastructure and pilot programs within large ecosystems, which help refine their offerings.

“Certain well-known national players have partnered with startups to integrate advanced technologies into their supply chain operations, testing solutions like automation and predictive analytics,” Ulcakar stated.

Singh emphasized how this approach accelerates innovation, particularly in regulated industries like fintech and healthcare.

“Startups backed by corporate investors show stronger performance, as these partnerships can significantly accelerate regulatory approval processes and market entry,” he said.

Saudi National Bank’s venture capital arm is an example of an organization enabling fintech startups to scale efficiently by offering regulatory navigation support and access to a large customer base, he added.

“The Saudi VC market is undoubtedly burgeoning, with abundant demand for bankable capital and distinct funding and technical advantages brought by various players on the supply side,” Ulcakar said.

The market’s maturation is evident, with funding reaching $987 million in 2022, and CVCs accounting for 32 percent of all deals — a significant rise from less than 15 percent in 2018.

This growth is not limited to Aramco and stc — banks including SNB Capital, Riyad Bank and SAB are emerging as key players, further diversifying the funding landscape.

Additionally, Saudi Venture Capital continues to act as a catalyst for the ecosystem, having deployed over SR3.4 billion ($905.7 million) through direct and indirect investments.

This has propelled Saudi Arabia to capture the highest share of total VC funding in the MENA region, reaching 54 percent in the first half of 2024, up from 38 percent during the same period in 2023.

The Kingdom’s VC ecosystem is marked by a collaborative dynamic between corporate and traditional VCs.

Singh highlighted that “87 percent of CVC-backed deals in 2022-23 included traditional VC participation.”

This high rate of co-investment reflects a complementary relationship, where both types of investors contribute to building a more sophisticated, institutionalized ecosystem.

Singh noted that this coordinated evolution spans multiple sectors and is essential to creating a sustainable innovation landscape aligned with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030.

Looking ahead, the key question is how this ecosystem will consolidate further, potentially positioning the Kingdom as a global private capital hub.

“The diversity of approaches — from direct CVC arms to partnerships with established VC firms — demonstrates the market’s growing maturity and suggests a sustainable growth trajectory,” Ulcakar stated.

This progress is a critical component of the Kingdom’s strategy to establish itself as a leader in technology and innovation.

In sectors such as energy and logistics, Saudi Arabia’s CVCs are playing a pivotal role in driving innovation.

Ulcakar explained that the Kingdom is leveraging its global footprint to balance present needs with future aspirations.

Investments in fossil fuel infrastructure, for example, are complemented by efforts to localize electric vehicle technologies and pioneer nuclear fusion projects. These investments often blend incremental improvements with disruptive technologies, creating a dual pathway for transformation.

CVC arms are distinctive in their dual mandate to achieve financial returns while pursuing strategic objectives for their parent companies.

This dual focus shapes their investment and risk management philosophies, setting them apart from independent venture capital firms.

Singh said: “Unlike traditional VCs, which prioritize financial exits and short-term gains, Saudi CVCs often adopt a longer-term, patient capital strategy.”

This approach allows them to align their investments with their parent companies’ strategic goals, even if such opportunities involve higher initial risks or extended timelines.

For instance, Aramco Ventures invests in clean energy and carbon capture technologies, aligning with the parent company’s energy transition and sustainability goals.

These investments represent long-term bets with strategic implications, demonstrating a willingness to prioritize alignment with corporate objectives over immediate financial returns.

Similarly, tali ventures focuses on digital innovation while reinforcing stc’s leadership in telecommunications and digital services.

By investing in startups, tali ventures not only targets financial returns but also strengthens stc’s digital payments ecosystem, creating synergies that benefit the parent company’s broader ambitions.

Singh highlighted this dual approach as a key differentiator, noting that these capabilities enable Saudi Arabia CVCs to pursue opportunities that might otherwise be deemed too risky by independent VCs.

Ulcakar emphasized the nuanced nature of this approach. “The ability to generate both financial and strategic returns represents a unique advantage and a complex challenge in this growth market. There is no one-size-fits-all answer,” he said.

Ulcakar also noted that Saudi Arabia is one of the few growth markets that has successfully financed its own development, with investor preferences gradually evolving.

“We observe a gradual shift toward prioritizing financial returns over strategic ones, aligning with the Kingdom’s evolving investment goals,” he added.

NEW DELHI: Oil prices were little changed on Friday but were set for their biggest weekly decline since October as the uncertainty around US tariff policy is creating concerns about demand growth at the same time major producers are set to increase output.

Brent futures rose 17 cents, or 0.24 percent, to $69.63 a barrel by 6:15 a.m. Saudi time. US West Texas Intermediate futures rose 12 cents, or 0.18 percent, to $66.48 a barrel.

However, for the week Brent is down 4.9 percent, set for its biggest weekly decline since the week of Oct. 14. WTI is set to drop 4.8 percent, also its biggest weekly fall since that week.

Markets, including oil, have been whipsawed by fluctuating trade policy in the US, the world’s biggest oil consumer.

“It looks like the financial markets are in full panic mode, no longer easily pacified by Trump’s one-month postponements and exemptions on import tariffs,” said Vandana Hari, founder of oil market analysis provider Vanda Insights.

“That leaves crude stuck around four-month lows, albeit vulnerable to further slides,” she added.

On Thursday, US President Donald Trump suspended the 25 percent tariffs he had imposed on most goods from Canada and Mexico until April 2, although steel and aluminum tariffs would still go into effect on March 12 as scheduled.

The amended order does not fully cover Canadian energy products, which are under a separate 10 percent levy.

The tariffs themselves are considered a drag on economic growth and therefore oil demand growth. But the uncertainty over the policy is also slowing business decisions, which is also impacting the economy.

“The risks to oil prices remain tilted to the downside with new supply from OPEC+ and non-OPEC producers expected to push the market well into an oversupply,” Fitch’s research unit, BMI, said in a note.

Brent prices on Wednesday fell to their lowest since December 2021 after US crude inventories rose and in the wake of the decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, to increase their output quotas.

The group said on Monday that it had decided to proceed with a planned April output increase, adding 138,000 barrels per day to the market.

Some of the downward momentum in prices has eased as the US is looking at steps to halt exports from key OPEC producer Iran.

“We are going to shut down Iran’s oil sector and drone manufacturing capabilities,” US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in his first major speech to Wall Street executives.

Reuters reported on Thursday that Trump is considering a plan to inspect Iranian oil tankers at sea using an accord aimed at weapons of mass destruction, according to sources, part of the US president’s “maximum pressure” to drive Iranian oil exports down to zero.",https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x371_watermarksaudi/public/main-image/2025/03/08/4581108-1451646102.jpg?itok=7Th6z3IG,N,,2025-03-08 18:50:54.311669

A pipeline is a pipeline is a pipeline. Or is it? There are over 2.6 million miles of oil and gas pipelines in the US, according to the Department of Energy. How did they all get there? Largely because of a legal principle called eminent domain, which allows governments to expropriate private property rights for public purposes such as building or widening roads or extending runways at airports. The theory is that the public good should prevail over private property rights if the ability to meet needs of the community at large is strong enough. Governments must compensate property owners, but legal wrangling over what is fair compensation is common. There are attorneys, accountants, and engineers who make entire careers out of litigating such disputes, and they seldom go hungry.

But there is a sting in the tail of this particular legal principle. Often, private companies prevail on state or local governments to take land by eminent domain for quasi-public purposes that directly benefit private interests. Sports stadiums are a classic example, but there are many others, one of which is building more pipelines, because 2.6 million miles of them is clearly insufficient for America’s needs. But not all pipelines are the same. If those underground highways carry petroleum or methane gas, that is ipso facto a matter of vital national interest. Those pipelines must get built to support America’s need for energy dominance. But if the stuff moving through a proposed pipeline is not a fossil fuel, then stop the presses! All bets are off.

Anti-Pipeline Law In South Dakota

South Dakota has 304 miles of transmission and 5,367 miles of distribution pipelines. Summit Carbon Solutions plans to construct an $8.9 billion, 2,500-mile pipeline to carry carbon dioxide from the dozens of ethanol facilities in the Midwest to sites in North Dakota, where it will be injected deep underground to be stored for millions of years — or a least a few weeks — thereby keeping it out of the atmosphere, where it might contribute to global overheating. The problem is, to get from the Midwest to North Dakota, conveniently, one needs to go through South Dakota and that state, which never met a pipeline it didn’t like, has suddenly developed an aversion to carbon dioxide.

In fact, according to the Associated Press (we prefer to use news sources that refuse to knuckle under to fascists), Larry Rhoden, that state’s Republican governor, last week signed a new law that bans the taking of private property for building carbon dioxide pipelines. “I made my decision based on my own consideration of the facts, the policy arguments, legislative history, my own opinions and experience, and my judgment about what is best for South Dakota,” Rhoden said. It is not immediately clear how Summit can move forward with its project if it cannot build in South Dakota.

Summit Carbon Solutions, predictably, was not pleased, claiming South Dakota “changed the rules in the middle of the game.” In other words, they thought the fix was in and were sad to see the economic rewards they expected to gain from their endeavor slipping through their fingers. “This kind of regulatory uncertainty creates real challenges — not just for our project, but for the ethanol plants in South Dakota that now face a competitive disadvantage compared to their counterparts in neighboring states,” the company said. “While this presents obstacles, our project moves forward in states that support investment and innovation, and we will have more news on that soon.”

In South Dakota, the pipeline for carbon dioxide has drawn intense opposition from landowners who fear a taking of their land for the pipeline and the dangers of a potential pipeline leak. Property rights are a passionate issue in South Dakota, where voters last year rejected a suite of regulations that opponents said would deny local control over such projects and consolidate authority with state regulators. Supporters called it a “landowner bill of rights.” The new South Carolina law contains this rather specific language: “Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, a person may not exercise the right of eminent domain to acquire right-of-way for, construct, or operate a pipeline for the preponderant purpose of transporting carbon oxide.” Summit says it has approvals for its pipeline in Iowa and North Dakota, a leg in Minnesota, and the underground storage piece of the puzzle.

Supporters of the pipeline see carbon capture projects such as the Summit pipeline as a way to fight climate change and to help the ethanol industry. Opponents question carbon capture’s effectiveness at large scale and say it allows the fossil fuel industry to continue unchanged. In actuality, it is more like 2% fighting climate change and 98% helping the ethanol industry. Carbon capture projects are eligible for lucrative federal tax credits intended to encourage cleaner burning ethanol. Potentially ethanol from corn could be refined into sustainable aviation fuel — and someday pigs will have wings.

Political Sparks Fly

Karla Lems, a Republican, introduced the law the governor just signed in the last session of the South Dakota legislature. She welcomed the signing and criticized Summit’s “heavy hand” toward landowners, claiming its project is all about tax credits. She is not wrong. Iowa Renewable Fuels Association executive director Monte Shaw fired back, saying South Dakota’s action is unfortunate for neighboring states and “an unnecessary roadblock” between “Midwest corn farmers and much needed new markets. The demand for ultra-low carbon ethanol around the globe is so massive that, at the end of the day, no one state will be able to stop the ethanol industry from accessing that market,” he said in a statement.

Some opponents argue the amount of greenhouse gases sequestered through the process would make little difference and could lead farmers to grow more corn despite environmental concerns about the crop. The cynical among us might suggest that the ethanol program that requires at least 10% of all gasoline sold in the United States has been a multi-decade boondoggle cooked up by Big Ag to divert federal funds into its overflowing coffers. Others disagree, sometimes vehemently.

A farming website that calls itself the New Roots Institute lists a number of concerns people have with growing corn. It says, “There are many environmental harms associated with modern forms of farming, and the same is true of modern corn farms.” Here are a few of the points made by New Roots. It says industrialized corn farms use a lot of water, which is draining groundwater in the middle of the US. The excessive fertilizer from corn farms runs into rivers and oceans, causing dead zones that are harmful to marine life. There is now a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico which threatens animals, plants, and whole ecosystems. Pesticides used on the farms are said to directly harm insects, honey bees, and birds.

In addition, two centuries of industrial agriculture in the United States have led to soil erosion and degradation. Rather than growing corn in polycultures as Native Americans did, US farmers grew corn in monocultures and decimated their topsoil with similar environmental effects to clear-cutting a forest. Soil can store nearly three times the carbon of forests and other types of vegetation, but injecting it with fertilizers makes it hard for living beings to survive. This contributes to long term damage to soil structure, which may make it hard to grow food in the future. In other words, short term thinking focused on greed has long term consequences that are harmful to the human community.

In addition, New Roots says applying fertilizer, using diesel to run tractors, kicking up dust while tilling the land, and pesticide production are all major contributors to air pollution from corn farms, which has been linked to 4,300 premature deaths a year in the US. Applying ammonia is a key culprit in the air pollution created by corn farms. This pollution includes significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. That’s not all. As well as being a mainstay of intensive crop agriculture, the production of cheap corn is a component of industrial animal farming. It enables concentrated animal feeding operations to confine and feed livestock for part or all of their lives in a way that harms the animals and the environment.

Greenwashing For Fun & Profit

Moving our focus outward, it is intuitively obvious to the most casual observer that this is all part and parcel of the carbon capture scam promoted by Big Oil for decades. It doesn’t work, it has never worked, and it never will work at sufficient scale to amount to more than a pisshole in the snow when it comes to addressing humanity’s penchant for polluting the environment for financial gain. Regular reader Dan Allard, who is an actual farmer and knows a thing or two about farming, alerted me to this story in an email that included this (lightly edited) message. “Pipelines crossing entire states to pump CO2 into the ground means insane amounts of energy wasted. Using ethanol as a fuel additive was always a stupid idea to subsidize the over-production of corn. It is a hard crop to grow anyway since it requires tons of chemical pesticides, so over-production is doubly stupid.”

We can be certain South Dakota’s new law has little to do with the environment and everything to do with the state government picking winners and losers in the marketplace, something Republicans say they hate when others do it. Take that for what it’s worth.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Corn.jpg,N,,2025-03-08 12:50:33.913966

As Boom Supersonic gets ready for ultra-fast flights from London to New York, President Donald J. Trump has recently shown off designs for the “Son of Concorde” supersonic jet.

The President beamed as he posed with an Overture model, of a plane being built by Boom Supersonic – presented to him by the firm’s CEO.

As noted by The Sun, the photo was proudly posted on X by Boom Supersonic chief Blake Scholl.

Scholl suggested that Boom Supersonic should manufacture Air Force One – the President’s personal plane – and took a cheeky dig at China.

He wrote: “Air Fore Once should be supersonic. Xi [President of China] can keep his 747-8.”

Overture is dubbed the “Son of Concorde” because it will fly faster than the speed of sound – as the original Concorde did.

The company has built a plane called Boom XB-1 – known as “Baby Boom” – which first flew on Mar. 22, 2024 and is a one-third scale model of the Overture airliner design.

XB-1 is history’s first independently developed supersonic jet and supersonic demonstrator built by Boom Supersonic, the aerospace company building Overture, the world’s fastest airliner. XB-1 provides the foundation for Overture.

Boomless Cruise

Additionally, XB-1 also provided confirmation of no audible sonic boom during its recent supersonic runs proving that quiet supersonic flight (AKA Boomless Cruise, where no audible boom reaches the ground) is possible on Overture.

When in Boomless Cruise, speeds are 40-50% faster than conventional airliners. This means a flight from New York to Los Angeles can be up to 90 minutes shorter. Hybrid routes with overland and overwater segments, such as Chicago to Frankfurt, will also see incremental time savings.

Unlike “low boom” designs, Boomless Cruise does not require extensive aircraft shaping. Instead, it relies on the ability to break the sound barrier at a high enough altitude where the boom refracts harmlessly away from the ground.

On Overture, Boomless Cruise is specifically enabled by the Symphony engines. These engines feature enhanced transonic performance compared to commercially derived engines, allowing Overture to efficiently transition to supersonic speeds at altitudes above 30,000 feet.

Additionally, Boomless Cruise is enabled by an advanced autopilot which uses current weather conditions and software algorithms to automatically select the optimal speed for Boomless Cruise.

Noteworthy, boomless and low boom are distinct concepts. In Boomless Cruise, Overture’s sonic boom does not reach the ground. However, at its full Mach 1.7 speed over water, Overture will generate a sonic boom.

Book of 130 orders and pre-orders

Overture is designed to be most efficient at high subsonic speeds of Mach 0.94 and supersonic speed of Mach 1.7. As aerodynamic drag increases closer to speed of sound, there is a modest increase in fuel burn at low supersonic speeds. Even with this drag penalty, Overture still has plenty of range to fly the longest transcontinental routes, such as Vancouver-Miami.

According to Boom Supersonic, the initial Overture is not designed as a low-boom aircraft, and the company does not expect to certify it for unrestricted supersonic flight over land.

Overture has an order book of 130 orders and pre-orders from American Airlines, United Airlines, and Japan Airlines. In 2024, Boom completed construction on the Overture Superfactory in Greensboro, North Carolina, which will scale to produce 66 Overture aircraft per year. Optimized for speed, safety, and sustainability, Overture and its bespoke propulsion system, Symphony, are designed to run on up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Boom aims at flying the first example of Overture by 2029.

With the unveiling of its ultra-high-speed private jet concept, comparisons to the legendary Concorde are inevitable. Promising to revolutionize private aviation in the same way Concorde redefined commercial supersonic travel, Virgin Galactic’s private jet aims to offer an unparalleled experience in speed, efficiency, and luxury. But does it truly live up to the legacy of Concorde? Let’s examine its technological advancements, market potential, and the broader implications for the future of high-speed travel.

The legacy of the Concorde

The Aérospatiale/BAC Concorde, introduced in 1976, was the pinnacle of commercial supersonic aviation. Capable of reaching Mach 2.04 (about 1,354 mph), it could transport passengers across the Atlantic in just over three hours—less than half the time of conventional jets. Despite its technological marvel, Concorde faced several hurdles, including high operational costs, limited seating capacity, and environmental concerns, particularly regarding noise pollution from its sonic booms. After 27 years of service, the Concorde was retired in 2003 due to economic unfeasibility and declining demand following the tragic Air France Flight 4590 crash in 2000. However, it remains a symbol of innovation and ambition in aviation history.

The Concorde was a technological marvel, but its supersonic capabilities were limited by the restrictions imposed on it. Due to its intense sonic boom, many countries banned it from flying over land, forcing it to operate almost exclusively on transatlantic routes. Its fuel consumption was also exorbitant, making it financially unsustainable for commercial airlines. Despite these challenges, the Concorde’s unique design and incredible speed made it an icon of luxury and prestige.

The culture of the Concorde

Aside from the mechanical capabilities of the Concorde, it represented the blending of European and American cultures. In short, to be a passenger on the Concorde (at any time during its operating history) was a vibe. Even though modern day air travel advancements has made getting to Europe from New York only slightly longer than a flight from to Los Angeles, it's b no means a commuter flight. Most commercial passengers wouldn't consider going over to London for two or three days, return to New York and then repeating the same trip a few days later. With the Concorde, the travel was cut down to less than half of a workday. This ease of sophistication is something that hasn't really been replicated.

Virgin Galactic’s private jet: The Concorde reborn?

Technological advancements and speed

Virgin Galactic’s private jet, currently in development, is designed to fly at Mach 3, exceeding even the Concorde’s top speed. The aircraft is being developed in partnership with Rolls-Royce, a company with deep expertise in supersonic propulsion systems, including its work on the original Concorde’s engines. Unlike the Concorde, which relied on turbojet engines with afterburners, Virgin Galactic’s jet is expected to utilize advanced turbofan technology to enhance fuel efficiency and reduce noise.

Moreover, modern aerodynamics and lightweight composite materials allow the aircraft to overcome many of the limitations that plagued Concorde. Advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and wind tunnel testing ensure an optimized fuselage that minimizes drag and maximizes fuel efficiency. This results in a more sustainable approach to supersonic flight compared to its predecessor.

Another significant improvement over the Concorde is the potential for variable-cycle engines that can adjust between subsonic and supersonic flight modes. These engines would provide greater fuel efficiency while enabling quieter takeoffs and landings, a major issue that restricted the Concorde’s operations.

Luxury redefined

The Concorde, despite its groundbreaking speed, had a relatively small and cramped cabin, accommodating just 92 to 128 passengers. Virgin Galactic’s private jet, on the other hand, is designed for an elite clientele, offering a spacious and customizable interior. The cabin will include lie-flat seating, private suites, and cutting-edge entertainment systems, catering to high-net-worth individuals, business executives, and government officials.

With luxury in mind, the jet’s interior will be designed to rival the most opulent private aircraft in the world. Features such as panoramic windows, AI-assisted flight experiences, and personalized in-flight services will create a unique, high-end experience. Unlike Concorde, which was designed for commercial airline use, Virgin Galactic’s jet is tailored to serve the exclusive needs of ultra-high-net-worth individuals.

In addition, the aircraft will feature climate-controlled zones, a dedicated conference area, and a high-tech galley for gourmet dining. It will redefine the concept of luxury air travel by merging high-speed capabilities with the comfort of a five-star hotel.

Overcoming Concorde’s limitations

Despite on the surface being a fantastic and convenient way to travel, the Concorde was not without its issues. The sonic boom it produced, massive amounts of jet fuel and other factors made it a challenging aircraft to operate. These factors eventually made it so operating the Concorde was no longer economically feasible.

Environmental and regulatory considerations

One of the primary reasons for Concorde’s demise was its environmental impact, particularly its fuel consumption and sonic boom issues. Virgin Galactic’s design team is actively working on mitigating these concerns. The jet is expected to incorporate sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and hybrid-electric propulsion elements to reduce carbon emissions.

To address noise pollution, Virgin Galactic is exploring “boomless” supersonic flight technology, allowing for quieter operation over land. Unlike the Concorde, which was restricted to transoceanic routes due to noise regulations, this jet may have the potential to operate more flexibly across global air routes.

Another key aspect of the aircraft’s environmental strategy is its focus on aerodynamics. Its sleek, ultra-efficient design will enable it to reduce drag and minimize fuel consumption, ensuring that supersonic travel becomes more environmentally responsible than it was in the past.

Market viability and economic sustainability

The Concorde’s downfall was partly due to its limited market appeal and high operational costs. Virgin Galactic’s private jet is positioned differently—targeting a niche but highly profitable segment of private aviation rather than commercial air travel. With a business model focused on high-net-worth individuals, sovereign clients, and corporate jet services, the aircraft has a better chance of financial sustainability.

Additionally, advancements in manufacturing techniques, such as 3D printing of aerospace components and AI-driven maintenance systems, will help lower operational costs, making supersonic travel more financially viable than it was in the Concorde era.

Supersonic travel for commercial passengers was never financially sustainable, but by focusing on private clients, Virgin Galactic’s jet will be able to charge premium prices for unparalleled speed and comfort. This could allow it to succeed where the Concorde failed.

The viability of hypersonic travel

Hypersonic travel—speeds exceeding Mach 5—represents the next frontier in aviation. While Virgin Galactic’s private jet is currently designed for supersonic speeds, the potential for hypersonic private aviation remains an open question.

Technological and economic challenges

The primary obstacle to hypersonic flight is the extreme heat generated at such speeds. Materials must withstand temperatures exceeding 3,000°F, requiring advanced thermal shielding and specialized engineering. This significantly raises production costs and complexity.

Furthermore, fuel efficiency becomes an even greater concern. Hypersonic aircraft would require high-energy fuel sources, potentially driving operational expenses to unsustainable levels. Unlike supersonic travel, which is becoming more economically feasible due to advancements in aerodynamics and materials science, hypersonic travel still faces substantial cost barriers.

Market demand and potential solutions

For hypersonic private jets to become viable, demand must justify development costs. While governments and defense agencies have significant interest in hypersonic technology for military applications, commercial interest remains limited due to cost and regulatory challenges.

However, breakthroughs in propulsion—such as scramjet technology and advancements in hydrogen fuel—could eventually make hypersonic private jets more feasible. If costs decline and regulatory hurdles are overcome, hypersonic travel could revolutionize international business by reducing intercontinental flight times to under two hours.

The future of supersonic private travel

Virgin Galactic’s private jet represents a very bold step toward making supersonic travel a reality for an elite few. Unlike the Concorde, which aimed to democratize high-speed air travel for commercial passengers (but ultimately fell short due to costs), this aircraft embraces exclusivity as its primary advantage.

If successful, it could pave the way for a new generation of supersonic and even hypersonic private jets, redefining business travel and international connectivity. With industry leaders like Boom Supersonic, Aerion, and even NASA working on similar projects, Virgin Galactic’s venture is a significant piece of the puzzle in the resurgence of high-speed aviation.

Virgin Galactic is also exploring future possibilities such as hypersonic travel, which could further shrink travel times. If technology and regulations allow, we may eventually see private jets capable of reaching speeds above Mach 5, making intercontinental travel nearly instantaneous.

While it may never achieve the same cultural impact as Concorde, Virgin Galactic’s private jet is poised to fulfill a long-held dream: flying at supersonic speeds with all the convenience and comfort of private aviation. The age of the Concorde may be over, but its spirit of innovation lives on in the skies of the future.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/supersonic.jpg,N,,2025-03-08 10:50:05.912416

Cosmo Energy, the country’s third-largest oil refiner, will produce SAF from used cooking oil at its Sakai refinery in western Japan.

“Our goal is to increase SAF supply to 300,000 kiloliters by 2030 through both domestic production and imports,” stated Takeshi Takada, general manager of new business development at Cosmo Energy.

Japanese refineries are mandated to supply SAF equivalent to 10% of their aviation fuel sales by 2030, aligning with Japan’s efforts to combat climate change and reduce carbon dioxide emissions from air travel.

A company official confirmed that 300,000 kiloliters would be sufficient to meet 10% of Cosmo’s jet fuel sales.

Cosmo Energy plans to produce 30,000 kiloliters of SAF annually at Sakai, source 150,000 kiloliters from its Sakaide site using bioethanol, and import 120,000 kiloliters from Thailand’s Bangchak and other Asian suppliers, according to Takada.

The refiner aims to establish expertise and customer relationships by launching production and sales before competitors, despite ongoing challenges in reducing costs, securing raw materials, and finalizing purchase agreements.

The Sakai project, targeting production of 24,000 kiloliters in fiscal year 2025 after accounting for site maintenance, has already secured major customers, including Japan Airlines, ANA, and DHL.

Cosmo’s next goal is to initiate SAF production at Sakaide by around 2029, with a final investment decision expected in fiscal year 2026. Both projects have received government subsidies, covering approximately half of their capital expenditures.

Cosmo declined to disclose production costs or SAF prices for the Sakai facility but anticipates profitability with government subsidies. It is estimated that SAF costs three to five times more than traditional jet fuel.

While increased production volume could potentially reduce distribution costs, significant cost reductions are unlikely due to raw material constraints, which constitute a large portion of expenses, Takada explained.

“Japan’s subsidy program is at a moderate level compared to global standards. Countries will compete to offer attractive subsidy schemes for SAF deployment to maintain hub airport status,” Takada said.

Recently, the Sakaide plant and three other projects received part of 340 billion yen in government subsidies over five years to support domestic SAF production.

These projects include Eneos’ 400,000 kiloliter facility in Wakayama, Idemitsu Kosan’s 250,000 kiloliter plant in Yamaguchi, and Taiyo Oil’s 200,000 kiloliter project in Okinawa, all currently in the design phase.

Idemitsu has also received a separate subsidy for a 100,000 kiloliter project at its Chiba refinery near Tokyo.

Carbon Market ""The U.S. carbon market has taken a step back,"" Meyer said.
The Global Carbon Market The U.S. has a voluntary carbon market with three states that have a mandatory carbon program through their low carbon fuel standard: California, Oregon, and Washington.
""We estimate that the U.S. carbon market is worth $2–3 billion and that may stretch to $5 billion,"" Meyer said.
Program Qualifications There are a variety of products and practices that farmers can employ that will make them eligible for carbon market programs.","Low commodity prices are driving interest in carbon market programs, according to Jarod Creed, owner of JC Ag Financial Services, and owner and partner of Elite Ag Insurance. That was evident at the 2025 Commodity Classic as farmers packed into the Successful Farming Main Stage to attend the panel “Finding the Right Carbon Program.”

In addition to Creed, panelists included Kelly Garrett, Pete Meyer, and Kaylynn Henkenius.

In 2020, Garrett, a sixth-generation Iowa farmer with a 7,000-acre no-till operation, became the first farmer in the nation to sell carbon credits to a corporate buyer. In 2024, Garrett teamed up with Creed, Meyer, and Mike Busing to launch Regenerative Roots Solutions to help farmers navigate the different carbon market programs available. Meyers is a principal economist and partner at Regenerative Roots and Muddy Boots Ag. Busing is an agronomist who owns an ag retail business where Henkenius works as a sustainability adviser. The panel covered the state of the U.S. carbon market, the need for better data collection, eligibility qualifications, as well as the opportunities for farmers in the global market and the potential financial impact of signing up for a program.

The U.S. Carbon Market

""The U.S. carbon market has taken a step back,"" Meyer said. ""A lot of that has to do with the uncertainty with the Trump administration. We heard from USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins on Sunday beating up again on some of the programs that were in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which included 45Z for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).""

Section 45Z of the IRA provides a tax credit for production of clean transportation fuels, including for SAF. There are three buckets for how that credit could be divided up: the sustainable aviation fuel producer, the ethanol company, and the farmer for producing corn with a lower carbon intensity (CI) score. ""A year ago, I was more excited about the financial possibilities for a farmer because it was going to be a dollar or 50 cents a bushel for a CI score of zero,"" Meyer said. ""But the fact of the matter is, once you get down to that third bucket, I'm not sure how much of it is going to end up in the farmer's pocket.

“I think we have to focus less on how much money could possibly come to a farmer from 45Z and focus more on the demand for corn, which we are in desperate need of,"" he continued. ""The airlines are committed to net zero emissions by 2050 and SAF needs to be part of that program. It's consumer driven, and it creates more demand.""

The Global Carbon Market

The U.S. has a voluntary carbon market with three states that have a mandatory carbon program through their low carbon fuel standard: California, Oregon, and Washington. In Europe, business owners must buy a carbon credit for each ton of carbon dioxide emitted.

""We estimate that the U.S. carbon market is worth $2–3 billion and that may stretch to $5 billion,"" Meyer said.

How does that compare to Europe? ""The European market last year was about a trillion dollars,"" Meyer added. ""When you combine the U.S. corn and soybean crop, that's worth maybe $125 billion.""

The reason for that is, global buyers, whether it's in Europe or Asia, ""are very interested in the type of credits that the U.S. farmer produces by sequestering carbon in the soil,"" Meyer said.

Regenerative Roots connects U.S. farmers with those global buyers.

Better Data Collection

One key part of enabling these carbon credit transactions is ensuring accurate data collection from the farmers. Regenerative Roots facilitates this by taking a more hands on approach.

""We make a connection to the farmer's data platform of choice. John Deere Operations Center and Climate FieldView are the two main ones,"" Henkenius said. ""From that platform, we're able to get 60-80% of the grower's data in most cases. Then I have a conversation with the farmer to go back and fill in any gaps.""

That could include adding in if a field has tile or irrigation or making sure that fertilizer passes from ag retailers are included. ""Once data collection is complete, farmers move into contracting and payment,"" Henkenius added.

That is the reason Regenerative Roots exists, Garrett explained. ""Creed is going to make fun of me when he talks and tell you that I don't even know how to log into my John Deere Ops Center, but Kaylynn does. And that's the reason for that,"" Garrett said. ""None of our data is perfect, and it needs to be to go into these programs.""

Meyer added to that point: ""The strongest carbon credits command a premium, and the strongest carbon credits are the ones with the cleanest data that can be verified in the shortest period of time.""

Program Qualifications

There are a variety of products and practices that farmers can employ that will make them eligible for carbon market programs. Those differ by region and should still be grounded in what agronomically makes sense for a grower, Garrett said.

""Sustainability means different things in different parts of the country. In the hills of western Iowa, no-till and cover crops are the first two that come to mind,"" he said. ""In southeast Arkansas, it's water usage."" Other practices include variable rate fertilizer applications, integrating livestock, plant growth regulators, stress mitigation products, and nitrogen use efficiency products to name a few.

Financial Impact

In 2025 so far, Regenerative Roots has distributed $10 million to farmers from various programs. ""It's not chump change,"" Creed said. ""I wonder if there are going to be situations in the next couple of years where 10–20% of overall revenue on a farm is going to come from carbon farming.

""There are situations where we could be talking about $100–200 an acre based on practices,"" he continued. ""In an environment when we're looking at $100–200 negative margins, it's simple math.""

Garrett participates in Truterra's carbon program and is waiting on his credits from 2022, 2023, and 2024 to go through their model, which should be done in a few weeks. He estimates that he nets a little over $30 an acre selling carbon credits.",https://www.agriculture.com/thmb/IYvWY9tHdt_mwKKeX8a7vN9VXTY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/commodity-classic-carbon-d3623ca2fb0d40ab956cf5e62b742677.JPG,N,,2025-03-08 09:50:07.827805

Regardless, Hawaii remains one of the few viable U.S. destinations where supersonic travel is possible even under current rules.","The dream of supersonic travel to Hawaii just soared somewhat closer to reality as Boom’s XB-1 announced it has wrapped up its test program with a second successful supersonic flight. With its groundbreaking “Boomless Cruise” technology, Boom Supersonic aims to revolutionize air travel, including to Hawaii—but not everyone is convinced this vision will take off.

Boom’s ambitious plans have drawn strong opinions from aviation enthusiasts, skeptical industry veterans, and Hawaii travelers. Some see this as a game-changer, while others doubt it will ever take off. With Overture now in development, the real question is whether Hawaii will see supersonic flights or if this is another Concorde-style dream.

Supersonic flight advances.

Boom’s final test flight, its second supersonic flight, took place on February 10, 2025. XB-1 hit Mach 1.18 at 36,514 feet, successfully demonstrating key supersonic capabilities. The flight gathered critical data on aerodynamics, acoustic impacts, and the ability to achieve supersonic speeds without generating the dreaded audible sonic boom on the ground.

With these tests complete, Boom is shifting focus to Overture, the aircraft designed to bring commercial supersonic travel back to the skies.

Some travelers already imagine the possibilities, with one reader saying they would “sign up for supersonic Hawaii-to-Paris in six hours.” Others remain skeptical, questioning whether shaving two hours off a flight from San Francisco to Honolulu is worth the cost.

Boomless Cruise: a game changer?

Boomless Cruise redirects the sonic boom upward into the atmosphere, preventing it from reaching the ground. This innovation could allow Overture to achieve supersonic speeds over the U.S. without the noise disruptions that grounded past overland flights. For Hawaii, this could extend beyond typical West Coast routes. Boom claims it can cut travel times from the U.S. West Coast to just three hours—if regulatory and logistical hurdles can be overcome.

A former Concorde ground school attendee dismissed the idea entirely, calling XB-1 “a vanity project” and predicting it “will never make scheduled flights to Hawaii in our lifetime.” Not everyone is ready to rule it out. Some see a strong opportunity here. “If you can get from Oakland to Honolulu gate to gate in two and a half hours, I will be in love with Boom,” wrote another traveler.

From test jet to airliner: the real challenge.

Making the jump from their single-pilot test jet to a commercial airliner remains a massive challenge. Commenters pointed out that XB-1 at just 68 feet long is a fraction of the size and complexity of the planned commercial aircraft. Jon questioned whether Boom could scale up successfully, saying, “Scaling from a single-seat demonstrator to a passenger jet is an entirely different engineering challenge. They’re not even close to proving that part yet.” Others echoed concerns about the leap in engine requirements, manufacturing, and certification. DICKIE_D dismissed the XB-1 as “a publicity stunt,” adding, “Show me a full-size prototype, and then we’ll talk.”

The regulatory hurdles ahead.

While Boom’s technology is promising, FAA regulations remain a significant barrier. Current U.S. aviation law prohibits all supersonic flight over land, regardless of noise impact. Government regulators, often cautious about tourism-related advancements, may resist such a significant change. However, some believe Hawaii’s unique geography makes it an ideal candidate for supersonic travel, even under current rules.

Some readers think Hawaii state officials would try to stop Boom. One commenter argued, “The backwards Hawaii government will never allow Boom. They’d rather force tourists to arrive by outrigger than approve a technological step forward.”

Others believe a policy shift is possible. An aviation enthusiast pointed out, “Hawaii is being used as an example because once you are feet wet off the west coast, you can punch through the number and not worry about sonic boom fines.”

FAA regulations, not Hawaii lawmakers, will ultimately determine if Boom can proceed. Regardless, Hawaii remains one of the few viable U.S. destinations where supersonic travel is possible even under current rules.

Who will fly supersonic to Hawaii?

Even if Boom overcomes regulatory challenges, the question remains about who will pay the price for supersonic travel. Many doubt the average traveler will afford it.

“Another giveaway to the ultra-wealthy,” one commenter wrote. “Rich people don’t care that a ticket will cost upwards of $5,000… If they did, they’d just fly first class on a regular jet with the rest of us.”

Others see the value in speed. A longtime Hawaii traveler pointed out that “we fly first class 97% of the time anyway. If costs are about the same, we’d definitely fly the SST.”

Industry experts also raise concerns about commercial viability. One reader questioned the financial model, asking, “Would you rather get there four hours faster in a cramped aircraft or pay for a more spacious first-class experience? Comfort over speed every time.”

Boom’s vision, whether realistic or not, aligns with Hawaii’s evolving tourism model, where fewer visitors are expected to spend more per trip. If airlines see demand from high-spending travelers willing to pay a premium for speed, supersonic flights to Hawaii could become part of this shift.

Overture’s timeline and what’s next.

With XB-1’s test program complete, Boom is moving full speed ahead with Overture. The company expects its supersonic airliner to roll out by the early 2030s, with test flights targeted before commercial service begins. More precise dates haven’t been provided.

Boom claims Overture will run on 100% sustainable aviation fuel and be far more efficient than Concorde. However, skepticism remains about whether the necessary engines will even exist. One critic dismissed the project outright, saying, “The airplane will never exist, not least of which is because its engine will never exist. The project is a scam.”

Despite these doubts, airline interest continues. United Airlines has ordered 15 Overture aircraft, and Japan Airlines has invested in Boom’s development. Whether those planes will serve Hawaii remains unknown.",https://beatofhawaii.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/1000011163.jpg,N,,2025-03-08 09:50:26.315738

The goal? Make it financially viable for investors and position the UK as a leader in green aviation. ✅ Key moves to make SAF take off: • SAF Mandate starting in 2025 • Airspace modernization projects • £63 million boost through the Advanced Fuels Fund But here’s the real game-changer: a guaranteed strike price model. Think of it like this: • If SAF prices fall below a set price, the government steps in to cover the difference. • If prices rise above that threshold, producers pay back the surplus. 💡 Who’s paying for this? Not taxpayers. The aviation industry itself will foot the bill via a levy on fuel suppliers—a “polluter pays” principle in action. 🚨 Why does this matter? Because SAF production isn’t easy—or cheap. • Plants cost £600M-£2B to build. • There’s no global price benchmark for SAF. • Investment is competing with other low-carbon tech. 💰 Breaking down the cost: • A single SAF plant could cost £2B over 15 years. • Industry-wide costs to meet 2035 targets? £10B over 15 years (but £7B could be repaid if SAF prices rise). • Minimal impact on ticket prices, since fuel price stability could balance things out. 📅 What’s next? • Consultation runs March 3 - March 31, 2025. • A Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill lands in 2025, with full legislation by 2026. • Industry input will shape the levy structure.

They were in contact with Job Service,” Lacher said Friday.
The Fargo Job Service office will also be open later hours — 5 to 7 p.m. — on April 8 and 9 for CNH employees, Lacher said.
Mahoney, who was out of the office when reached, said he did not recall seeing a WARN notice yet.","FARGO — The Case New Holland plant in Fargo will be laying off nearly 200 hourly workers, a company spokeswoman confirmed Friday, March 7.

“CNH has announced workforce reductions at its Fargo, N.D., facility due to current and anticipated market conditions,” Kristina Post, a communications specialist with CNH said in an emailed statement.

“Employees were notified earlier this week, with approximately 198 hourly positions affected,” Post said. “CNH is dedicated to supporting these individuals during their transition.”

The Fargo Case New Holland plant is at 3401 1st Ave. N. Workers at the plant build tractors and loaders for the agriculture and construction industries.

Carey Fry, the workforce center manager at the Fargo Job Service North Dakota office, said workers have begun inquiring about unemployment benefits, and that Job Service is in contact with CNH “to help their employees that are going to be let go.”

Fry said her office has been informing CNH employees about what services Job Service provides, and how to file for unemployment insurance if necessary.

Fry said that when a company does a significant layoff, Job Service will provide services on site.

“This is a big one (a layoff). This is a major one, right, then we will go on site and help them with whatever needs they have in terms of getting a new job and applying for unemployment,” she said.

Large layoffs often require the filing of a notice under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining (WARN) Act.

Job Service North Dakota did not get an official WARN Act notice, said Ruth Lacher, the Bismarck-based manager of the agency’s workforce programs division. However, CNH “made us aware of the layoff. They were in contact with Job Service,” Lacher said Friday.

Lacher said Job Service will be holding a job fair at the plant for CNH employees on March 18, inviting local employers to meet with individuals being laid off.

The Fargo Job Service office will also be open later hours — 5 to 7 p.m. — on April 8 and 9 for CNH employees, Lacher said.

Employees entitled to notice under WARN include managers and supervisors, as well as hourly and salaried workers. WARN requires that notice also be given to employees' representatives, the local chief elected official and the state dislocated worker unit.

The Forum contacted Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney on Friday. Mahoney, who was out of the office when reached, said he did not recall seeing a WARN notice yet.

“I don’t remember reading it up to this date. You are right, I should get a notice if they are going to have that many people laid off,” Mahoney said. “It’s unfortunate. We love that team.”

“To our knowledge, we have not seen anything yet,” said Fargo’s City Administrator Michael Redlinger. However, he added that the notice could still be in the mail.

The Forum has also reached out to Jeff Hoopman, directing business representative for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace workers, for comment on the layoffs.

In early February, the West Central Tribune reported that CNH Industrial America was permanently laying off 175 people in April at its Benson, Minnesota, facility.

According to the U.S. Department of Labor, WARN protects workers, their families and communities by requiring employers with 100 or more employees (generally not counting those who have worked less than six months in the last 12 months and those who work an average of less than 20 hours a week) to provide at least 60 calendar days advance written notice of a plant closing and mass layoff affecting 50 or more employees at a single site of employment.

Regular federal, state, local and federally recognized tribal government entities that provide public services are not covered.

Not all dislocations require a 60-day notice, according to the Department of Labor. The WARN Act makes certain exceptions to the requirements when employers can show that layoffs or worksite closings occur due to faltering companies, unforeseen business circumstances and natural disasters. In such instances, the WARN Act requires employers to provide as much notice to their employees as possible, according to the department.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/ed9cd67/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4431x2954+0+0/resize/1599x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcc%2Fd5%2F64a8f9bf49fba95ec80d1950b94e%2F030825-n-ff-cnhlayoffs-1.jpg,N,,2025-03-08 09:50:32.712611

Abstract

This paper investigates stakeholders’ motivations and barriers within emerging Future Flight business models. Aviation is vital for developing economies, and the urgent need for a transition towards more sustainable practices is gaining prominence. Hence, understanding the factors shaping Future Flight technology’s adoption is crucial. Drawing on ten interviews with pioneering Future Flight-related technologists, business leaders, social entrepreneurs, and policymakers, we employed the Technology-Organisation-Environment framework and Transaction Cost Economics theory to analyse critical factors influencing Future Flight business models. We show participants are concerned about sustainable aviation fuel availability and Future Flight technologies’ readiness. We emphasise the importance of technology maturity and commercial viability for successful Future Flight implementation. Smaller start-ups are poised to lead such development because of their nimbleness and sustainability focus. Concurrently, larger companies face challenges transitioning from traditional business models. We identified regulatory frameworks, social acceptance, and public demand as key drivers. Finally, we show how entrepreneurs desire standardised global regulations to support sustainable aviation practices. We offer insights into the complex dynamics of Future Flight adoption, highlighting companies’ need to evaluate their cultural and human resource strategies while emphasising global regulatory standards’ importance – as part of The CoFFEE Project’s (www.​coffeefutureflig​ht.​com) broader research programme.

(Brazil Ministry of Foreign Affairs) Brazil welcomed with great satisfaction the technical recommendation on sustainable aviation fuels made during the 13th triennial meeting of the Aviation Environmental Protection Committee (CAEP) of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

The recommendation, which will be submitted for confirmation by the ICAO Council in June, addresses multiple or sequential cropping for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production. The practice, which involves growing two or more annual crops on the same land, is common in agriculture in tropical and subtropical regions.

Based on technical, scientific and environmental aspects, the CAEP recommendation will allow ICAO methodologies to consider the specific realities of tropical and subtropical regions. This is a long-standing request from Brazil and other countries interested in contributing to the decarbonization goals of the aviation sector.

By recognizing a greater number of sustainable practices and raw materials as eligible for large-scale SAF production, ICAO is acting in line with its mandate under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to promote emissions reductions in the international aviation sector. Although SAF production is still at very low levels globally, it will be essential for international aviation, currently a major emitter of greenhouse gases, to achieve the global goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.",https://advancedbiofuelsusa.info/assets/images/Advanced-Biofuels-Logo.jpg,N,,2025-03-08 05:50:21.573848

“The National Rural Health Association (NRHA) applauds Representatives Budzinski, Finstad, Davis, and Taylor for their introduction of the Rural Wellness Act.
We look forward to continuing to work with Congress to address the behavioral health shortage in rural areas,” said Alan Morgan, Chief Executive Officer of the National Rural Health Association.
The Rural Wellness Act is also endorsed by the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors (NACBHDD) and the National Association for Rural Mental Health (NARMH).","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Nikki Budzinski (IL-13), Congressman Brad Finstad (MN-01), Congressman Don Davis (NC-01), and Congressman Dave Taylor (OH-02) introduced the bipartisan Rural Wellness Act to expand access to quality health care in rural communities by providing competitive grants for telemedicine projects, with an emphasis on projects focused on substance use disorder treatment.

“No one should have to travel hours just to visit the doctor, and telemedicine is an efficient way to reduce the barriers to care so often faced by rural communities,” said Congresswoman Budzinski. “I’m proud to be working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to introduce legislation to expand access to this technology while prioritizing care for mental and behavioral health, as these challenges impact countless folks across the country – no matter where you live. I’ll always fight to ensure that rural residents can receive the high-quality, accessible care they deserve.”

“Access to telehealth in rural communities has been life-changing for those who would otherwise have a difficult time traveling long distances to the nearest medical facility,” said Congressman Finstad. “I joined Congresswoman Budzinski in reintroducing the Rural Wellness Act to ensure residents of southern Minnesota have access to timely, high-quality healthcare through expanded telemedicine services.”

""Community mental health services in rural America must be more accessible and available, as they are in other areas of the country,"" said Congressman Davis. ""The Rural Wellness Act prioritizes behavioral and mental health services for rural communities and ensures we are not leaving behind those who need and seek help.""

“There is a devastatingly high rate of mental health challenges and substance abuse in our Nation, and living in a rural area shouldn’t be a barrier to accessing critical health care services,” said Congressman Taylor. “I am proud to help lead the reintroduction of the Rural Wellness Act with Congresswoman Budzinski to increase rural Americans’ access to behavioral telehealth and substance abuse treatment.”

The Rural Wellness Act would reauthorize USDA Rural Development's Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program through Fiscal Year (FY) 2029, including a 17 percent set-aside for telemedicine projects that provide substance use disorder treatment. Moreover, this legislation would improve the program by including language prioritizing behavioral and mental health treatment services.

Eligible areas include communities with populations of 20,000 or fewer, and funds may be used for telemedicine equipment, broadband facilities, and technology. Awards range from $50,000 to $1 million with a minimum 15 percent match requirement.

“The National Rural Health Association (NRHA) applauds Representatives Budzinski, Finstad, Davis, and Taylor for their introduction of the Rural Wellness Act. This bill would prioritize grant applications that address behavioral and mental health in critical Rural Development programs and help to ensure that rural communities have adequate access to local, much needed behavioral health services. We look forward to continuing to work with Congress to address the behavioral health shortage in rural areas,” said Alan Morgan, Chief Executive Officer of the National Rural Health Association.

The Rural Wellness Act is also endorsed by the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors (NACBHDD) and the National Association for Rural Mental Health (NARMH).

Council delegates will decide whether to move forward with the new name via a majority vote on Aug. 1 during its 65th Annual Board of Delegates Meeting in Grand Rapids, MI as the organization celebrates its rich history in supporting the U.S. agricultural industry over the past 65 years.

“The reality is we are now not just limited to taking meetings within the global ethanol space, we are interfacing with players in the broader energy industry,” said Ryan LeGrand, USGC president and CEO, during remarks in Austin. “Ethanol and related products have become part of our identity in practice, but not in name, and it is time to signal to these new audiences that we have something to offer.”

The Council has undergone this process before, when it changed its name from the original U.S. Feed Grains Council to its current title in 1998.

“We are at an inflection point for our organization – one that requires our members’ consideration of an amended organizational name that carefully balances and maintains the 65 years of brand equity we’ve built but also is broad enough to reflect what the organization is about as a whole and where we are going in the future,” LeGrand said.

The change will require three separate changes to the organization’s bylaws, and if approved by delegates during the Council’s summer meeting, updates to the Council’s online presence and physical signage to match the amended name will be gradually implemented.

This week a new state economic forecast confirmed that there is a decrease of the surplus, which includes the uncertainty of a federal funding freeze. With President Trumps’s off and on again tariffs, pausing of grants, and threats to cut Medicare, inflation is up and the growth on domestic products (GDP) is down.

Last November, the state budget forecast showed a $3.7 billion surplus over the current budget cycle, a $616 million positive balance in the upcoming biennium, and our highest budget reserve fund ever–all due to responsible DFL governance. But as of today, Minnesota’s projected positive balance has shrunk to $456 million.

Instead of bringing down prices as they promised on the campaign trail, President Trump and Republicans in Congress are on the verge of enacting a sweeping tax cut for corporations and the top 1% of earners, and they’re going to pay for it by slashing Medicare which is the largest portion of the federal investments in health care for children, families, seniors, and people with disabilities. We receive $128 billion dollars from the federal government; that is 1/3 of our state budget. If even one fourth of those cuts happen, it could blow a huge hole in our state budget.

This latest budget forecast means that the Legislature must be laser-focused on working together to set a balanced state budget by the time session ends on May 20.

As your state representative, I’m committed to fighting for an economy where everyone in Hopkins, St. Louis Park, and Edina can get ahead. I will continue to oppose bills to place barriers to healthcare access, cut education funding, and repeal policies that help Minnesotans thrive like Paid Family and Medical Leave.

Despite the devastating, proposed cuts at the federal level, we did receive some good news in Minnesota reflecting our commitment to deliver reliable investments into our state’s schools. In the 2023-2024 biennium, DFLers delivered an education budget that updates Minnesota’s general education formula to be indexed to inflation. In previous years, Minnesota schools have needed to wait until the legislature passes the biennial budget to know whether or not the education funding formula would be increased. The Minnesota Department of Education recently shared with Minnesota school districts, due to indexing, the new increase to the per-pupil formula allowance taking effect for the 2025-2026 will translate to a new investment of $7,481 per student which is a $200 per pupil increase.

You can read my press release for more details here.

Floor Action

On Monday, the Minnesota House debated House File 12, a Republican-sponsored bill that would exclude our transgender athletes from playing sports in our schools. This is in direct conflict with our Minnesota Human Rights Act, as well as the Minnesota State High School League's policy that has been in place for the last ten years with no issues. I spoke on the House Floor about the dangerous path this bill would take us on if passed. History has shown us that once you start excluding a group of people just because of who they are, it doesn’t end there, and it never ends well. You can view my floor remarks here. House Democrats were unanimous in their opposition to the bill, which did not receive enough votes to pass the Minnesota House.

On Thursday, we voted down HF 13, a ‘Shoot First’ bill which would remove Minnesota’s duty to retreat, allowing Minnesotans to use deadly force when they feel any level of threat in our public spaces. When this policy has been put in place in other states, it has been shown to lead to even more gun violence victims and more loss of life. Minnesota continues to make progress on reducing gun violence. The bill failed to reach the 68 votes needed to pass on a party line vote. I was glad we were able to pass two bipartisan bills to address sex trafficking in Minnesota and will continue to work across the aisle with my colleagues on setting our state budget for the next two years.

Committee Work

Committees are starting to get busy as the GOP continues to move their agenda through committees without hearing many of our bills.

On Monday in the Ways & Means Committee, we heard a Rep. Baker (R) bill to delay the implementation of Paid Family & Medical Leave (PFML). This program is on track to be implemented in 2026 and to delay it would cost Minnesotans money and valuable time.

On Tuesday in Taxes we heard change market value exclusions on home day care properties and a tax credit for remodeling underutilized buildings which Hopkins Mayor Patrick Hanlon testified in support of. I am excited to have my first bill up this session in the Tax committee next week to provide non-profit daycares a break on property taxes. In Education Finance, we heard a bill to expand non-public pupil aid to counselors to K-6 students. Current law allows for counselors in non-public schools in grades 7-12.

Wednesday in the Taxes Committee, we heard a variety of interesting proposals including one that provides a $9 billion dollar tax cut to benefit those in our higher tax brackets. We also finished our discussion around tax exemptions for data center purchases.

On Thursday, the Tax committee heard bills to increase funding for Soil and Water Conversation Districts, tax exemptions on particular properties, and a bill to provide a tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel. We finished up the week of hearings in Education Finance with an informational hearing on two bills that would allow school districts to ignore any of the initaitives we put into place to help our schools and students, including how they are able to allocate funds within the school district.

Constituent Visits and Events

Saturday, Jacques and I attended the Hopkins Education Foundation Gala. It was fun to spend time with friends while supporting the Hopkins School District. We also got to see the new mascot costumes for the Hopkins Royals.

This week was very busy at the Capitol with multiple groups of constituents and organizations visiting to advocate for a variety of legislative policy. A group of developers and contractors met with me to talk discuss the 'Homes for All' bills.

A big thank you to Rep. Julie Greene for organizing a group of students to come to the Capitol and learn about it’s inner workings. They met with legislators, a lobbyist, our House Chief Clerk Patrick Murphy, took a tour of the Capitol, and sat in on the House Education Finance Committee.

Community Education is a very important part of our public schools. I had the opportunity to meet with a group of community education leaders to discuss some of the challenges they are facing with programs across the state and how legislators can help.

I had a chance to meet with an amazing group of U of M pharmacy students, as well as two practicing pharmacists. We discussed the barriers to patient care and the need for increased reimbursements for our pharmacies all over the state.

As the Lead on the House Education Finance Committee, I frequently meet with school districts across Minnesota. I had a great conversation this week with members of the South Saint Paul school district: Superintendent Brian Zambreno; School Board Chair Kim Humann; School Board Member Paul Cummings; Representative Rick Hansen and Mary Frances Clardy. They were asking for additional Compensatory Aid so they can help their students thrive.

The Full-Service Community Schools model is an incredible program providing state funds for districts to develop public private partnerships so they can provide wrap around services to our students and families in our public schools. Thank you to Craig Sweet for the visit to talk about the increased funding needs for full-service community schools to expand across Minnesota.

Constituents David Homans with the Citizens Climate Lobby and Karin Cotter with the Center for Energy and Environment met with me during the Clean Energy Business Day. Thank you for all you are doing to make sure we leave the planet a little better for the next generation.

Some of Minnesota's finest from the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees met with me on Thursday. These are the folks that work in every one of our state agencies in areas from cybersecurity, public safety, healthcare, and more. Thank you for your service to our state!

It was great to see Hopkins Councilmembers Heidi Garrido and Brian Hunke who were visiting the Capitol with the League of Minnesota Cities.

I also had visits from our incredible school social workers, the Minnesota Catholic Conference, and the PACER Center. It is wonderful to see the Capitol full of folks who want to have their voices heard. As we continue our work to produce a balanced two year state budget, we will continue to hear from groups from all over the state.

He emphasized the need for expanding demand in the farming sector, arguing that carbon capture could be a key driver. “Every year our corn yields go up, every year the efficiency of ethanol plants goes up, but we’ve basically been running in place on the demand front,” he said. “Capturing carbon and creating a low-carbon feedstock like ethanol for sustainable aviation fuel or higher blends is absolutely a winner—and something we desperately need.”",,N,,2025-03-07 17:53:45.303223

In this installment of our CCS pipeline coverage, we explore why ethanol producers are pursuing pipelines and which other options are available if the pipelines fail.

CCS Pipelines: Silver Bullet or Misfire?

In 2022, former President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which created the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit and upped the benefit for the 45Q tax credit for carbon sequestration.

The year before, the federal government announced the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Grand Challenge to escalate SAF’s market share in fueling American aircraft. SAF can be made from ethanol and is seen as a potentially immense new market for that cornstarch-based fuel. However, in order for a SAF producer to claim the 45Z credit, they must use ethanol with a carbon intensity (CI) score much lower than the current Midwest average of 55.2.

These factors, combined with growing societal interest in lowering carbon emissions and the looming existential threat of electric vehicles, signaled to the ethanol industry it needed to find a way to lower CI. CCS pipeline projects emerged as a favored solution.

Capturing CO2 from the fermentation process of ethanol production is estimated to reduce ethanol’s CI by roughly 30 points, according to a study commissioned by Growth Energy, a national ethanol trade association.

Growth Energy’s study looked into the various ways ethanol producers and corn farmers could help lower ethanol CI. Among the many steps a plant could take, the study showed CCS had the best balance between CI reduction and cost of implementation.

Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA), put the benefits of CCS this way: “There’s lots of things you can do to reduce your carbon score. If you don’t do CCS, you almost have to do everything else, and you still may not get there, depending on your facility, and it would be infinitely more expensive.

“If you’re a standard Iowa plant at a 55 CI score and you do CCS alone, you’re probably attractive for SAF. If you do a couple of the other things, you’re going to be really attractive for SAF. So that is why we are focused on CCS. It’s the affordable thing that literally unlocks the market.”

However, from environmental groups to landowners, CCS pipeline projects have faced opposition that jeopardizes their success. It begs the question: What viable alternatives are there?

On-Site Sequestration

Some plants, such as Red Tail Energy in Richardton, North Dakota, may be able to sequester their own CO2. However, CO2 cannot be sequestered just anywhere; the proper geology must exist underground to hold the CO2 in place. Successful Farming compared ethanol plant locations in the middle of the country, where most plants are located, with areas identified by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to have large-scale CO2 storage potential. Many plants do not overlap with the areas USGS identified. (See map.)

Shaw also noted that even if a plant were advantageously located for CCS, it may still need to pipe the CO2 to an appropriate location off the plant’s property.

Alternative Uses for CO2

Ethanol producers may choose to find an alternative use for CO2. That’s exactly what Adkins Energy, an ethanol plant in Lena, Illinois, is seeking to do.

Bill Howell, chief operating officer of the plant in northwest Illinois, said Adkins Energy is working with another company, Real Carbon Technology, to convert captured CO2 into green methanol.

“I want to make something out of a raw material that I’ve been given, and frankly, I don’t look at CO2 as a waste; I look at it as a raw material,” he said. “And I think in the future, it’s going to become a very valuable raw material, particularly if we can figure out how to convert it to clean fuels.” According to the Methanol Institute, a methanol industry trade association, methanol can be used as a fuel and to make hundreds of products, including plastics, paints, and car parts.

The company expects to have a demonstration production process running by late summer and be fully operational by late 2027. Howell said he expects the project to reduce the CI of Adkins Energy’s ethanol by 25 points.

CO2 can also be captured and sold for a variety of uses, including livestock processing and water treatment. But IRFA’s Shaw argues this is not a realistic alternative to sequestration.

“The industrial CO2 market includes using carbon dioxide to preserve food safely such as frozen food products,” he said. “That market has been longstanding for many years now, and a handful of ethanol plants supply it. So that’s not a viable market opportunity for plants not already doing it. It’s saturated.”

Plant Energy and Farmer Practices

Joe Kakesh, general counsel at Growth Energy, said if CCS pipeline projects don’t pan out, the industry would look to strategies that fall into one of two major categories: plant energy use and on-farm practices.

Growth Energy’s study found ethanol plants that use combined heat and power (CHP) systems can reduce CI by nearly 20 points if the systems are fueled with biomass such as corn stover.

“Currently, about 20% of the existing 187 U.S. ethanol plants already have CHP systems,” the study said. “Although most of the systems use natural gas, biomass can be mixed with natural gas in many CHP boiler systems at biorefineries.”

Kakesh said corn grown on farms that plant cover crops will be attractive; the association’s study attributed a nearly 24-point CI reduction to cover crops. However, Kakesh pointed out they cannot be planted in every environment. There is also a cost to the farmer.

Concerning the cost barrier to some ethanol plant innovations and farm practices, Kakesh said: “The cost issue only highlights the importance of continuing the incentives for the development of these technologies, in particular through the section 45Z tax incentive that was passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act…. That tax incentive can be a powerful means to invest in a diverse portfolio of technologies, both from the perspective of the biorefinery, and from the perspective of the farmer, because the way the farmer gains value is that they … are able to sell their corn at a premium.”",,N,,2025-03-07 17:53:50.935627

The Frankfurt plant is expected to produce up to 2,500 tons of e-fuel annually, contributing to the aviation sector's transition to sustainable alternatives.","INERATEC, a pioneer in sustainable e-fuel production, has secured a significant €70 million financing commitment to construct Europe's largest e-fuel production plant in Frankfurt. This funding, comprised of a €40 million venture debt loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and a €30 million grant from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, marks a pivotal step in decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors, particularly aviation.

The announcement, made at the EIB-Group-Forum in Luxembourg, underscores the strategic importance of e-fuels in achieving net-zero emissions. INERATEC's innovative Power-to-Liquid technology, which converts green hydrogen and CO2 into synthetic aviation fuel, is central to this initiative. The Frankfurt plant will utilize CO2 from a local biogas plant and hydrogen from an existing chlorine production facility, demonstrating a circular economy approach to sustainable fuel production.

INERATEC's process involves combining hydrogen with CO2 from biogenic sources, such as biogas plants or industrial emissions, to produce synthetic crude oil. This oil can then be refined into various synthetic fuels, including Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), marine fuels, and e-Diesel. By utilizing captured CO2, the plant significantly reduces the carbon footprint of these fuels, contributing to global efforts to mitigate climate change.

The new funding will enable INERATEC to scale up its production capacity and commercialize its reactor technology. The Frankfurt plant is expected to produce up to 2,500 tons of e-fuel annually, contributing to the aviation sector's transition to sustainable alternatives. With a single long-haul flight between Frankfurt and New York consuming approximately 80 tons of kerosene, the plant's output has the potential to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of numerous flights.

The project aligns with the European Union's ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, which mandates a minimum e-SAF blend of 1.2% by 2030, creating a substantial market opportunity for INERATEC. The collaboration between INERATEC, the EIB, and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst exemplifies how public-private partnerships can drive the commercialization of clean climate technologies.

EIB Vice-President Nicola Beer emphasized the bank's commitment to a competitive net-zero economy, particularly in sectors like aviation. Mario Fernandez, Head of Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, highlighted the importance of real-world projects in driving down costs and attracting investment in e-fuels.

The EIB's venture debt loan is supported by the InvestEU programme, which leverages private and public funds to support EU policy priorities, including the European Green Deal. The Innovation Fund, financed by the EU Emissions Trading System, provides a top-up guarantee to the InvestEU programme, further bolstering support for innovative climate technologies.",,N,,2025-03-07 14:36:36.401871

Japan targets to replace 10% of jet fuel with SAF by 2030

Cosmo Energy Holdings is set to launch Japan's first domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel in April, a step toward the country's goal of replacing 10% of jet fuel with a cleaner alternative, though cost-cutting challenges remain.

Cosmo, the nation's third-largest refiner, will produce SAF from used cooking oil at its Sakai refinery in western Japan.

""Our goal is to boost SAF supply to 300,000 kilolitres by 2030 through domestic production and imports,"" Takeshi Takada, general manager of new business development, said.

Japanese refiners must supply SAF equivalent to 10% of their aviation fuel sales by 2030, as Japan works to combat climate change and aligns with global efforts to cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from airplanes.

A company official said 300,000 kl (1.89 million barrels) would be sufficient to meet 10% of Cosmo's jet sales.

Cosmo plans to produce 30,000 kl of SAF annually at Sakai, supply 150,000 kl from its Sakaide site in western Japan using bioethanol and import 120,000 kl from Thailand's Bangchak and other Asian suppliers, Takada said.

The refiner aims to build expertise and customer relationships by launching production and sales ahead of competitors, despite challenges in reducing costs, securing raw materials and locking in buyers, he said.

The Sakai project, targeting production of 24,000 kl in fiscal 2025 after accounting for site maintenance, has already secured most customers, including Japan Airlines (JAL) and DHL.

Cosmo's next goal is to start SAF production at Sakaide by around 2029, with a final investment decision expected in fiscal 2026. Both projects have secured government subsidies, covering about half of capital expenditures.

Cosmo declined to disclose Sakai's production costs or SAF prices, but the company expects to turn a profit with the help of subsidies. SAF is estimated to cost three to five times more than conventional jet fuel.

While higher production volume could lower distribution costs, significant cost reductions are unlikely due to raw material constraints, which make up a large portion of expenses, Takada said.

""Japan's subsidy scheme is at a medium level by global standards ... Countries will compete to offer attractive subsidy schemes for SAF deployment to maintain hub airport status,"" Takada said.

Recently, the Sakaide plant and three other projects secured part of 340 billion yen ($2.3 billion) in government subsidies over five years to support local SAF production.

The projects include Eneos' 400,000-kl facility in Wakayama, Idemitsu Kosan's 250,000-kl plant in Yamaguchi and Taiyo Oil's 200,000-kl project in Okinawa, all still in the design phase.

Idemitsu has also secured a separate subsidy for a 100,000-kl project in its Chiba refinery near Tokyo.

These projects are key to boosting domestic production and meeting Japan's estimated SAF demand of 1.7 million kl by 2030.

The airline will offer passengers the option to choose SAF when their booking flights.

SAS and Alpine World Cup Åre are working to make travel more sustainable for large international sporting events that rely heavily on air transport.

The use of SAF is expected to lower emissions, with the potential to cut life cycle carbon emissions by up to 80% in comparison to conventional jet fuel.

Alpine World Cup Åre CEO Olle Danielsson said: “We recognise that air travel is an integral part of international sports, and we are committed to making travel to Alpine World Cup Åre as sustainable as possible.

“Through our partnership with SAS, we aim to take responsibility and inspire other stakeholders in the sports world to make conscious travel choices.”

The aviation sector’s transformation towards sustainability requires collective action from various stakeholders, including airlines, policymakers, authorities, corporations, and travellers, according to SAS.

,,2025-03-07 15:25:04+00:00,www.consulting.us,Sustainable aviation fuel demand projected to soar by 2030,,,,,https://www.consulting.us/news/11523/sustainable-aviation-fuel-demand-projected-to-soar-by-2030,"Despite this projected increase in production, current production of SAF is still seriously lagging.
In order to meet the expected demand in 2030, an additional 5.8 Mt of capacity will be needed.
The estimated future demand for SAF was calculated by looking at mandates and targets for SAF set by countries around the world.
HEFA SAF production capacity has been quickly increasing and could be the aviation industry’s best bet to meet increasing demand.
“The capital landscape for SAF investment is complex, with significant financial requirements across different project stages, from conceptualization and pre-feasibility to construction and commissioning.","Global demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is expected to reach 17.1 Mt/a (million tons per annum) by the end of the decade, according to a report from Kearney and the WEF. That means investment from $19 billion to up to $45 billion will be needed.

Despite this projected increase in production, current production of SAF is still seriously lagging. In order to meet the expected demand in 2030, an additional 5.8 Mt of capacity will be needed. For that to be possible, final investment decisions would need to be made by as soon as next year.

If global production does meet the supply projected by the report, it could well mean that the goal set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for a 5% reduction in the carbon footprint of international aviation by 2030 may well be achievable.

The estimated future demand for SAF was calculated by looking at mandates and targets for SAF set by countries around the world. For example, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Brazil, and Korea have all announced mandates that will be ramped up towards 2030.

It was all of these mandates and targets together that add up to 17.1 Mt/a of SAF in 2030. But with global production still at a very low level, reaching that estimated demand would mean an increase of SAF production capacity equal to around 5.8 Mt/a.

Different feedstocks, different outlooks

There are several different feedstocks that are used to manufacture SAF, each of which requires different amounts of investment in order to be successful. One of the most promising paths to viable SAF supply is what is known as the Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) method, which uses waste oils and fats.

HEFA SAF production capacity has been quickly increasing and could be the aviation industry’s best bet to meet increasing demand. That is mainly because the HEFA method is currently the least expensive, due to its efficiency and the maturity of the technology involved, meaning less capital expenditure is necessary.

“To expand existing pathways further, research is being done to overcome feedstock constraints,” reads the report.

“Examples include Brazilian energy company Acelen Renewables looking into macauba palm oil and GAFT, a Dutch company specializing in green air fuel technology, converting feedstocks using electrolysis and fermentation.”

Another method used to manufacture SAF is the alcohol-to-jet method, which uses ethanol and could be an option for countries with high ethanol production. This method is still an attractive pathway despite requiring more investment than HEFA.

There are other, more novel methods for producing SAF that still require more development, like transforming sewage waste through a process of hydrothermal liquefaction. The most expensive pathway is currently the power-to-liquid method, which can be up to eight times as expensive as conventional jet fuel.

More investment needed

The total estimated investment required to meet the expected demand for SAF by 2030 ranges between $19 billion and $45 billion, according to the report. That wide range in estimates is due to the different costs of developing different pathways.

For example, developing 99% of SAF from HEFA (the cheapest option) would only require around $19 billion in investments, but if the industry shifts towards developing other feedstocks that are more expensive, more investment would be needed.

“Attracting capital for SAF refineries is a challenging process that requires engaging with a wide range of stakeholders and exploring a myriad of financial instruments and mechanisms,” reads the report.

Some of the levers for attracting finance to these projects include pursuing research grants, tapping into funding from multilateral development banks, and issuing green bonds to attract impact investors, among other levers.

“SAF represents a crucial pillar in the decarbonization journey of the aviation industry, offering one of the most viable options to achieve the global vision for 2030,” the report concludes.

“The capital landscape for SAF investment is complex, with significant financial requirements across different project stages, from conceptualization and pre-feasibility to construction and commissioning. For SAF to reach scalable production, a shift in financing mechanisms is necessary, leveraging both private and public capital in innovative ways.”",https://www.consulting.us/illustrations/news/spotlight/2025-03-07-102720383-Sustainable_aviation_fuel_demand_projected_to_soar_by_2030_spot.jpg,N,,2025-03-07 12:02:00.714841

Montana Renewables produces 30 million gallons per year – but has its sights on increasing this significantly to around 300 million gallons per year. This impressive target will represent 10% of the U.S. government’s SAF Grand Challenge. But how did a refinery in Montana achieve such groundbreaking results in such a short timeframe?

The Montana Renewables’ story started with an idle 24,000-barrel-per-day catalytic feed hydrotreater and after a detailed study, the solution became clear: they would switch the idle capacity to renewable feedstock and rearrange the refinery to accommodate the production of renewable fuels, specifically SAF.

The process took just 18 months from the initial concept to full implementation. ""Most people take 18 months to do the initial study before they actually do any of the work,"" says CEO of Montana Renewables,

Bruce Fleming. The rapid turnaround was a testament to the team’s systematic approach and the careful

elimination of risks, with Topsoe’s technology at the heart of the project’s success.

The key solution: Topsoe’s HydroFlex™

Montana Renewables needed a technology partner with a proven track record, one that could mitigate risk and provide the tools needed for a smooth process. Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ technology was selected as the ideal solution.

""Chief among possible risks we assessed was: does the technology work? The best way to solve that is to select a technology provider with a proven track record and a history of operating units. Topsoe is head and shoulders above its competitors in that regard,"" Fleming says.

The installation of Topsoe’s HydroFlex™ catalyst was a straightforward conversion, and the results exceeded expectations.

The outcome

Thanks to our innovative technology, Montana Renewables has been able to quickly produce significant amounts of SAF. This strategic partnership not only secured their current output of 30 million gallons annually but will also enable them to aim confidently for their goal of producing 300 million gallons per year within the next two years.",,N,,2025-03-07 14:36:50.399223

It also represents the biggest investment in our history, and a turning point in the energy transition.

A revolution in green energy will begin when we start delivering energy efficient stacks to customers from our new Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell (SOEC) manufacturing facility in Herning, Denmark. This technology can turn renewable electricity into green hydrogen through electrolysis, also enabling derivatives such as e-ammonia, e-methanol and a variety of other end-products. These green chemicals will be essential in decarbonizing sectors like steel production, aviation and shipping, which are currently responsible for roughly 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

“Herning is the culmination of work that began in the late 1980s. It is our latest and perhaps most important contribution to solving global problems,” says Topsoe CEO, Roeland Baan. “It’s part of a tradition going back to pioneering ammonia production for fertilizer to secure food for a growing global population, and curbing acid rain by reducing emissions of sulfur and other pollutants from fossil fuels. We’re proud to be at the forefront of this part of the energy transition with a facility that will demonstrate on an industrial scale what our technology can do.”

Realizing a breakthrough technology

The green hydrogen produced with SOEC can be a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels. Power-to-X

can also produce other e-fuels, like e-ammonia and e-methanol. SOEC uses power more efficiently than other methods of producing hydrogen. As Kim Hedegaard, our CEO of Power-to-X, explains: “Green power is essential for the energy transition, but it’s still scaling up. So green electrons must be treated as precious

commodities. SOEC helps here because it is 20-30% more efficient than industry alternatives, such as

PEM and alkaline, when paired with technologies that produce waste heat.”

Herning will have a capacity of 500 MW per year, and compared to hydrogen produced from fossil fuels

it will avoid emitting 7.6 million tonnes of CO2 in its first ten years, equivalent to more than 4,000 return

flights from Paris to New York. The plant will be ready to ship its first electrolyzer stacks in the first half of

2025, reaching full capacity by 2026.

Contributing to Europe’s energy goals

Our technology has had a vote of confidence from the EU, through a EUR 94 million EU Innovation Fund

grant to Topsoe. The European Commisson’s ambition is to deploy 40 GW of European-produced electrolyzers by 2030. As Roeland Baan confirmed on receiving the grant: “This recognizes our leadership in

this field and our part in decarbonizing energy-intensive industries through the EU’s first industrial-scale

SOEC factory.”

For us, Herning is just the start of producing SOEC electrolyzers at scale.

Gevo also announced that it ended the fourth quarter with cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $259.0 million2.

Business Update – Path to Positive Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA1

Gevo North Dakota: Carbon Capture and Sequestration (“CCS”) and Low-Carbon Ethanol Assets generated $150 million in revenue in its last fiscal year3 and we expect it to immediately contribute $30 million to $60 million of Adjusted EBITDA1 annually to Gevo’s carbon business. This facility in North Dakota, which was recently acquired from Red Trail Energy, LLC, is one of two low-carbon ethanol plants with operational CCS that exist today. The site has an operating, fully permitted Class VI CCS well, which captures over 160,000 tons of biogenic carbon dioxide annually; generates multiple times that amount in total carbon abatement; produces approximately 67 million gallons of low-carbon ethanol, including 2 million gallons of corn fiber ethanol with an ultra-low carbon intensity; and more than 230,000 tons of low-carbon animal feed and vegetable oil. As a result, this facility has one of the lowest carbon intensity scores in the industry, at 19 gCO2e/MJ (from British Columbia) or an estimated 21 gCO2e/MJ (under the Argonne-R&D-GREET model). We note that the ethanol 45Z tax credit, which takes effect in 2025 and expires in 2027 (unless renewed by legislation), provides a statutory $0.02 per gallon per carbon intensity point below approximately 50 gCO2e/MJ. In addition, we are developing an additional alcohol-to-jet (“ATJ”) project at this location for further future growth, leveraging our existing ATJ designs associated with the ATJ-60 project in South Dakota. The high quality carbon abatement credits generated at this plant are expected to further catalyze the development of the emerging market for carbon abatement products.

Renewable Natural Gas (“RNG”): We have achieved excellent operational results that are expected to improve further in 2025 and generate meaningful Adjusted EBITDA1. RNG produced in 2024 was 367,000 MMBtu, which was a 17% increase over the prior year, because of a successful gas upgrade capacity expansion. 2025 production is expected to further increase to over 400,000 MMBtu as a result of compressor and reliability upgrades. Our RNG facility has been approved by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to generate biogas 45Z tax credits. Based on the expected carbon intensity (“CI”) score for California LCFS of (339) gCO2e/MJ, a negative number, and depending on LCFS prices, monetization of the biogas 45Z tax credit, D3 RIN prices, and price of fossil based natural gas, we expect Adjusted EBITDA1 of $9 – 18 million in 2025.

Alcohol-to-Jet 603 (“ATJ-60”) Project: The ATJ-60 project in Lake Preston, South Dakota continues to proceed towards financial close in 2025. In 2024, we received a conditional commitment for a loan guarantee with disbursements totaling $1.462 billion (excluding capitalized interest during construction) from the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) Loan Programs Office (“LPO”) for our ATJ-60 project. With capitalized interest during construction, the DOE loan facility has a borrowing capacity of $1.63 billion. We are actively engaged with the DOE on the closing process for the conditional commitment. Our ATJ-60 project is expected to leverage American agriculture to produce both cost-effective fuels and food, which are integral for energy and food security of the United States. We believe our ATJ-60 project integrates seamlessly with existing energy infrastructure and catalyzes the development of the rural economy. The project is expected to generate 100 jobs at the facility, as well as 700 indirect positions in support, plus 1,000 high-paying trades jobs for the three years of construction5. This project is expected to have regional economic impact greater than $110 million per year. We are currently engaged with the DOE LPO on due diligence, definitive documentation, completing the environmental review process, and satisfaction of all conditions precedent that are required for financial close. We expect to incur $40 million of additional spend on ATJ-60 from January 1, 2025, until financial close. Our cumulative ATJ-60 development spending is expected to be partially reimbursed at project financial close. We may invest some or all of the reimbursed funds back into ATJ-60 as equity.

Verity: We are continuing to grow our Verity business, delivering our tracking and tracing solution to the market, expanding the customer base, and achieving revenue. Verity is a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) business that achieved its goal of first customer revenue in 2024 and our grower program has grown to more than 200,000 acres, which is more than double the acreage in the program since the second quarter of 2024, with 100% farmer retention. Verity is a digital measure, report and verify (“MRV”) software platform for end-to-end traceability of the regenerative attributes of agricultural and low-carbon fuel products. This enables producers and customers to measure and track those attributes and create value in the marketplace, where demand for regenerative agriculture and fuels is increasing but visibility is lacking. Verity currently has agreements with seven agriculture processing plant customers, including five ethanol plants and two soybean processing facilities, to assist in tracking environmental attributes of corn, ethanol, animal feed, corn oil, soybean oil and renewable diesel. We believe Verity can provide substantial value to growers and processors of a wide variety of agricultural products globally, in markets valued at billions of dollars.

Ethanol to Olefins (“ETO”): We continue to advance our breakthrough, patented ETO technology. Our patented ETO process is designed to lower capital and operating costs of drop-in, bio-based hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals from ethanol, and adds to Gevo’s global portfolio of more than 300 patents, as well as proprietary processes and know-how concerning processes to convert carbohydrates to hydrocarbons. In October 2024, we signed a development agreement and licensed our ETO technology to Axens with the goal of accelerating the commercialization of our ETO technology for fuels. The alliance between Axens and Gevo was further broadened for ATJ commercialization in December 2024 under a new collaboration agreement. The goal of the alliance is to leverage the most advantaged technologies, which includes Axens Jetanol™ technology combined with Gevo’s plant designs, engineering, know-how, carbon tracking and complete business system. The alliance brings each partner’s complementary value propositions, real-world experience, substantially de-risked technologies, plant integrations, and pre-engineered systems to the ATJ space. We also extended a joint development agreement with LG Chem to accelerate the commercialization of bio-based chemicals using ETO. The global market for drop-in, low-carbon chemicals and materials is estimated to be $400 – 500 billion per year.

Management Comment

“Our strategic acquisition of Gevo North Dakota is transformative for our company,” commented Dr. Patrick Gruber, Gevo’s Chief Executive Officer. “The CCS and low-carbon ethanol provides us with an immediate pathway to monetize carbon abatement through the ethanol 45Z tax credit and by selling carbon abatement in the growing market and the available pore space provides additional opportunities for CCS expansion.”

“In addition, our RNG business is poised for significant growth as we secure a permanent CARB LCFS carbon intensity score and monetize the biogas 45Z tax credit. Taken together, we see a path to achieving a potential run-rate positive Adjusted EBITDA in 2025, even before considering our ATJ-60 project. This is based on the hundreds of thousands of tons of carbon abatement per year that we are currently generating from this diversified, low-carbon asset base,” Dr. Gruber continued.

Dr. Gruber added: “We are pleased that our DOE conditional commitment is progressing towards financial close. We are pleased to see that biofuels, ethanol, and aviation fuels are listed in President Trump’s Executive order “Declaring a National Energy Emergency”. Our ATJ-60 project, targeted for Lake Preston, South Dakota, is expected to create 100 direct jobs, and more than an estimated 700 indirect jobs. The project is expected to employ more than 1,000 construction workers for the three years needed to build the plant. It would draw corn from more than 230 farmers, and we would expect to pay farmers a premium for their regenerative agricultural practices.”

“We never lose sight that we expect that Gevo’s proprietary, integrated ATJ process can deliver sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”) with production cost similar to jet fuel made from crude oil,” Dr. Gruber said. “But our process can do this while also eliminating the carbon emission footprint across the whole life cycle of the fuel. It’s about addressing a growing market need, where customers will pay for carbon abatement, in addition to the jet fuel.”

CCUS and the role of regulation

While elements of Trump's climate policy remain uncertain, there is expected to be a strong political force from Democrats and Republicans alike to continue support for carbon capture. The US is the world leader for CCUS, with the world's biggest direct air capture facility - Stratos - expected to come online in Texas this year.

IDTechEx's report, ""Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) Markets 2025-2045: Technologies, Market Forecasts, and Players"", focuses on how well economies are developing these CCUS technologies globally. Alongside an emphasis on the business case for CCUS, the report also includes a detailed analysis of different carbon capture technologies, ranging from reducing energy demand for conventional amine solvent approaches to novel solutions using membranes and cryogenics.

Despite the US and Canada leading the CCUS technology sector with the implementation of tax credits, the EU's 2024 Net Zero Industry Act mandates a minimum of 50 million tonnes of CO2 storage capacity yearly by 2030, showcasing a global awareness of the importance of facilitating carbon capture and driving the growth of this technology.

Carbon dioxide utilization

The US offering tax credit support for CO2 utilization, particularly for enhanced oil recovery, will act as a strong incentive for project development. Emerging CO2 utilization application areas such as chemicals, fuels, and building materials (green concrete) will also see growth. IDTechEx's report, ""Carbon Dioxide Utilization 2025-2045: Technologies, Market Forecasts, and Players"", covers technical, economic, and environmental considerations for CO2 utilization products, with oil, greenhouse crops, methanol, and polyurethane being listed among the most mature applications currently.

The growth of sustainable data centers

With the rapid rise of AI, the demand for data centers has grown. New grid capacity is needed to support this continued expansion. This presents a key opportunity for investment in emerging renewable energy technologies - from hydrogen fuel cells to small modular reactors - as outlined in IDTechEx's ""Sustainability for Data Centers 2025-2035: Green Technologies, Market Forecasts, and Players"" report. Data center hyperscalers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta are some of the biggest companies in the world and have a long track record in purchasing wind and solar power. This continued investment in carbon-free energy will likely lead to long-term decreased energy costs.

Prioritizing sustainability

Despite the often high initial upfront costs of green technology development, incentives are present worldwide to make investments now for long-term benefits. Regulations and climate agreements are currently acting as drivers for development.

On the private sector side, numerous companies including Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, have set carbon neutrality targets.. A range of sustainable technologies will be required, from low-carbon energy sources to carbon dioxide removal. For example, Amazon and Microsoft have pre-purchased carbon credits from the Stratos direct air capture plant.",,N,,2025-03-07 14:00:38.778893

“I don’t think anyone has given up on the pipeline and no one has given up on South Dakota,” says Tom Buis.
The new law would ban the use of eminent domain for a carbon pipeline.
In 2023, the Navigator CO2 pipeline project was cancelled due to regulatory issues and government processes in South Dakota and Iowa.
The Summit Carbon Pipeline project currently spans five states including Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota.","The CEO of the American Carbon Alliance says he’s optimistic a carbon pipeline project can still move forward following the signing of a new eminent domain law in South Dakota.

“I don’t think anyone has given up on the pipeline and no one has given up on South Dakota,” says Tom Buis.

The new law would ban the use of eminent domain for a carbon pipeline. Summit Carbon Solutions says the law changes rules in the middle of the game and presents real challenges for the project.

Buis says without eminent domain, the company must get approval from all landowners along the proposed route.

“It’s a setback, but this whole process has been like playing whack-a-mole. One hurdle pops up and you have to take care of it and move on.”

Carbon pipelines can help the U.S. ethanol industry capture, store and sequester carbon to reduce greenhouse gases and make the fuel attractive for Sustainable Aviation Fuel. But these projects haven’t been easy to advance. In 2023, the Navigator CO2 pipeline project was cancelled due to regulatory issues and government processes in South Dakota and Iowa.

The Summit Carbon Pipeline project currently spans five states including Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. There have been permits issued in many of those states.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz says he thinks the carbon pipeline can still happen.

“We’ll continue to move to different inputs for Sustainable Aviation Fuel, but in the beginning, especially during a trade war, if it’s a good place for a market, we need to work on it.”

But South Dakota is a key state for the project and Governor Larry Rhoden recently told Brownfield “I think it’s incumbent for Summit Carbon to earn back some trust from South Dakota. I think a huge part of our problem is based on this lack of trust.”

Summit Carbon Solutions has previously told Brownfield they’ve been working to repair trust in South Dakota.

Buis says the company has changed from when the project started. “People aren’t giving them any of the benefit of the doubt with the changes made.”

And he says several options are possible for the project moving forward.

“If you look at a map, there are other ways things can be done, I’m sure, but we’ll see what happens. That’s Summit’s decision.”

Summit Carbon Solutions re-submitted a permit application for the project with the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission in November and the project is waiting on the state to issue its decision.",https://cdn.brownfieldagnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Summit-Carbon-Solutions-Map_UpdatedMarch24-e1709591993823.png,N,,2025-03-07 11:01:25.841085

Cosmo Energy Holdings is set to launch Japan's first domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel in April, a step toward the country's goal of replacing 10 per cent of jet fuel with a cleaner alternative, though cost-cutting challenges remain.

Cosmo, the nation's third-largest refiner, will produce SAF from used cooking oil at its Sakai refinery in western Japan.

""Our goal is to boost SAF supply to 300,000 kilolitres by 2030 through domestic production and imports,"" Takeshi Takada, general manager of new business development, said.

Japanese refiners must supply SAF equivalent to 10 per cent of their aviation fuel sales by 2030, as Japan works to combat climate change and aligns with global efforts to cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from airplanes.

Advt

A company official said 300,000 kl (1.89 million barrels) would be sufficient to meet 10 per cent of Cosmo's jet sales.

Cosmo plans to produce 30,000 kl of SAF annually at Sakai, supply 150,000 kl from its Sakaide site in western Japan using bioethanol and import 120,000 kl from Thailand's Bangchak and other Asian suppliers, Takada said.

The refiner aims to build expertise and customer relationships by launching production and sales ahead of competitors, despite challenges in reducing costs, securing raw materials and locking in buyers, he said.

The Sakai project, targeting production of 24,000 kl in fiscal 2025 after accounting for site maintenance, has already secured most customers, including Japan Airlines (JAL), ANA and DHL. Cosmo's next goal is to start SAF production at Sakaide by around 2029, with a final investment decision expected in fiscal 2026. Both projects have secured government subsidies, covering about half of capital expenditures.

Cosmo declined to disclose Sakai's production costs or SAF prices, but the company expects to turn a profit with the help of subsidies. SAF is estimated to cost three to five times more than conventional jet fuel. While higher production volume could lower distribution costs, significant cost reductions are unlikely due to raw material constraints, which make up a large portion of expenses, Takada said.

""Japan's subsidy scheme is at a medium level by global standards ... Countries will compete to offer attractive subsidy schemes for SAF deployment to maintain hub airport status,"" Takada said.

Recently, the Sakaide plant and three other projects secured part of 340 billion yen ( USD2.3 billion) in government subsidies over five years to support local SAF production. The projects include Eneos' 400,000 kl facility in Wakayama, Idemitsu Kosan's 250,000 kl plant in Yamaguchi and Taiyo Oil's 200,000 kl project in Okinawa, all still in the design phase.

Idemitsu has also secured a separate subsidy for a 100,000 kl project in its Chiba refinery near Tokyo. These projects are key to boosting domestic production and meeting Japan's estimated SAF demand of 1.7 million kl by 2030.

“It shapes you a lot,” he said. “You get to learn things quicker earlier in your career.”

O’Connor said being prepared for the future as a leader is one lesson he’s taken from his career as well as leading people well and doing good work.

“I look forward, and even as I look back, there is never going to be a stagnant point in our industry, in any industry, where you say, ‘We’re done,’ right? … For leaders to prepare themselves to manage change and to lead change versus [reacting] to change, I think is huge,” he said.

The Business Record sat down with O’Connor at Corteva’s Johnston campus to learn more about his career and new role.

This Q&A has been lightly edited for clarity and length.

Before this role you served in several leadership roles at Corteva, including as president of the North America business. Can you tell me a little more about that role and what your main focuses were?

I guess first and foremost for us as a business is the farmer is at the center of everything that we do, right? We have a very unique go-to-market in that we’re one of a few companies that have a direct relationship with the farmer. Our people, our Pioneer agents have a direct relationship with the farmer and certainly work really hard to become an integrated part in those farmers’ operations in their decision-making process. So, that’s probably the first thing. The second piece would be as we brought new technologies into the industry, whether it be corn grown above ground or insect control, whether it be below-ground protection, herbicide tolerance in crops, you know, all that innovation that we were bringing through the pipeline at the time, after the farmer, that was the big focus is how we bring this innovation and how we drive in more productivity, more sustainability in the business.

You’ve now been with Corteva for 25 years, how have you seen its innovations and technology evolve?

If you unwind it 100 years, the first big breakthrough innovation, it happened right here in the state of Iowa, was making hybrid corn. We were the ones that did that, and we significantly accelerated the yield per acre of Iowa farm ground with hybrid crosses versus open pollinated corn. It took a number of years for the entire industry to adopt hybrid corn. It was new technology. Information flow wasn’t as readily and easily available like it is today with the push of a button and the entire world knows. I mean, you had to actually go out and knock on doors, right? So hybrid corn was absolutely the first technology, and I guess we can be proud to be the ones that can, you know, say we had the first piece of that. Then we evolved into plant breeding with better disease resistance, and plant breeding with better drought tolerance and plant breeding with all those pieces that come just from the plant breeding side. Then, next generation was around biotechnology and how can you, again, increase those yield and productivity levels on that same acre of ground and do it in a more sustainable way. I think looking forward, gene editing is one that we’re making huge investments in. We have all the optimism in the world. We’re making great strides with it today. It can take seven years to get a hybrid through the pipeline. It can take 15, 16 years to bring a GMO trait through the pipeline. Gene editing is going to allow us to do it in just a fraction of that and it’s just an extremely precise tool. It’s going to be the next breakthrough in terms of next-generation products.

Is Corteva currently developing gene editing solutions?

Our research and development team has been working with it for a number of years now and we’ve actually got products on the shelf ready to go and all kinds of product concepts that our scientists and R&D team are bringing through today, whether that be disease resistance, drought, more yield, reduced stature corn. There’s all kinds of different applications that we can do with gene editing, and not only just in plant breeding. I mean, this can be leveraged in biologicals. You’re seeing things being leveraged in the human health side and the animal health side.

What are some other focuses of Corteva’s R&D teams?

We operate in 100-plus countries around the world today, and I would say that nearly every product no matter where it’s located in the world is likely touched in some way by this facility throughout its life cycle and as we develop those products. This place is an anchor for us and our seed business. We have around 2,200 employees here on campus, and a third of them are scientists with advanced degrees that are operating up here above my level.

We have 3,000 employees in the state of Iowa, and this is the hub for our global seed business, the R&D. Some other spaces that we’re operating in are hybrid wheat. We brought hybrid corn to the table 100 years ago, roughly. Next year, 2026, we’ll be a 100-year-old company and we’ve cracked the code on hybrid wheat and we’re going to bring that into the market commercially here over the next few years. It’ll ramp up obviously but it will be there in 2026, 2027. We’ll have our first hybrid wheat that’ll go in the ground commercially. So you look at what hybridization did for corn and we’ve got some optimists that said, think about what we could do with wheat, which is the largest planted crop in the world. We’ve got a big initiative around biofuels right now and how can we be part of the solution. From a biofuel standpoint, we’re doing some work in the South with winter canola and leveraging our winter canola product line in a double crop situation with soybeans. So a farmer gets two crops in one year and you’ve got a high oil crop like canola that we can work with processors and up the ante on biofuels and our ability to provide sustainable aviation fuel and all those things.

Tell me more about how Corteva is looking at sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). What opportunities are there?

Winter canola, it’s focused there just from a standpoint of can you in a sustainable, renewable way from an ag perspective continue to be part of very specific things like SAF, but we’re already doing that today in a huge way with our ethanol industry in the state of Iowa and Midwest. Biofuels and the shift in energy demand that we’re going to see, we think we have a seat at the table on that and we’re in the beginning stages of working hard to be a part of that.

What shifts in energy demand is Corteva watching?

Well, you’ve seen big shifts in solar, you’ve seen big shifts in wind. Drive around the state of Iowa. You see there’s been big investment in wind. And then sustainable renewable fuel sources like we have with ethanol today, like we have with biodiesel, like we have with now sustainable aviation fuel with the focus on that and some countries having mandates. So can ag and i.e., Corteva, be a pivotal part of enabling that? That’s the play, which means we’re going to probably have evolution in cropping systems, evolution in crops. We’re seeing that with cropping systems we’re testing here in the U.S. today, the products in the ground. We had the first harvest last summer. This will be our second harvest with expanded footprint and expanded acres with winter canola. Biofuels is a big focus for us, and how do we expand the footprint with nontraditional crops that could potentially even be a source, or a solution that we’re not doing today?

What are some of the challenges the regulatory environment can present for Corteva?

We consistently ask for science-based reliable regulation. Some of those things can change with the geopolitical environment, some of those things can change based on things other than science. So how do we keep focused on the fact that we’ve got great technologies that can do great things? And we want it to be fully and thoroughly and rigorously tested. But to invest on the behalf of our farmer customers for a decade and not have consistency or have geopolitical environments that don’t allow consistent and scientific-based regulatory environments creates challenges. It wouldn’t matter whether you talk to us, or Corn Growers Association, Soybean Growers Association, Farm Bureau. It’s a farmer-based challenge as well.

What other challenges does Corteva hear about from farmers and how are you working to address them?

It’s always about productivity. We’ve got a big effort from a decision sciences standpoint to say how do we leverage all the data that a farmer has and help them make better tools, whether it be on hybrid selection or fertility, agronomic practices, timing of when they make applications. We’ve been core and fundamental in high-touch agronomy since our existence started, so what are those key agronomic tools and practices that you can take this great genetic product that you’ve got here in seed and maximize it, right?

When have you had to manage change as a leader?

If you look at where we’re at with production agriculture today versus where we were when I started my career it’s not even identifiably the same. Technology in every way has really changed that. In the seed space, in the implement space, in data and tools that we have available. Recognizing how that change in evolution of agricultural practices is huge. Certainly, bringing three different legacy organizations into one Corteva — we were fortunate in that the cultures of the three different organizations were similar enough, and they were focused on agriculture and focused on farmers that the transition was good. But how do you bring all those years of history and legacy together and get to a common point? The opportunity for me to be directly involved in the integration efforts and standing up the new Corteva and shape what the structure of the organization needed to look like and who did we want to be, that was a privilege to get to be a part of that. It certainly shaped my thinking around change and change management.

As Corteva continues to innovate, will there be opportunity to add employees or grow the footprint of the Johnston campus?

In terms of the work that we’re doing in the seed space, this is where we will be. We’re fully 100% committed to Johnston in terms of the ebbs and flows of the number of people in the needs of people. Obviously this is home base for our seed business. One of the other pieces is obviously how do we continue to access the very best talent in the world. We have people here that come from many, many different places around the world and have made Iowa home.",,N,,2025-03-07 07:15:50.816270

While CO2 emissions have been in the spotlight for years, non-CO2 effects—such as contrails—are gaining attention for their significant role in global warming. Research, including NASA’s CODEX program, reveals that contrails can have a climate impact comparable to the accumulated CO2 emissions of aviation over the past century.

However, sustainability isn’t just about engines and flight paths—it’s also about smarter design and materials. And this is where AviationGlass wants to proves its value.

Addressing the misconceptions about glass in aviation

Many in the industry assume glass is too fragile or heavy for aircraft applications. Yet, innovations in ultra-thin, layered aviation glass have transformed these perceptions:

Strength: By using advanced layering techniques, aviation glass achieves exceptional hardness and scratch resistance, rivaling polycarbonate in durability.

Weight: Despite its strength, the weight of aviation glass is nearly identical to polycarbonate, making it a lightweight solution without compromise.

Why does glass stand out?

Lightweight construction: Reducing aircraft weight directly lowers fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. AviationGlass products are carefully engineered to maintain strength while being lightweight.

Durability & Longevity: Scratch-resistant, impact-resistant glass ensures fewer replacements, less waste, and long-term performance reliability.

Eco-Friendly Materials: AviationGlass aligns with the industry’s push for sustainability, offering materials with lower environmental impact and reduced maintenance needs through advanced coatings.

Sustainability in aviation: A comprehensive approach

The aviation industry’s approach to reducing emissions must be comprehensive. This includes contrail mitigation strategies, such as rerouting flights to avoid contrail-prone regions, combined with innovations like cleaner-burning engines, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and eco-friendly materials. AviationGlass can play a pivotal role in this transformation.

From inboard lenses, glass dividers, mirrors, in-flight screen covers, and ceiling panels to cabin interiors, AviationGlass supports airlines and OEMs with high-performance solutions designed for a greener future. Its lightweight, durable, and sustainable materials contribute to reduced emissions while enhancing passenger experience and operational efficiency.

Driving industry innovation

Recent advancements, such as JetZero’s blended-wing body aircraft and Delta’s focus on sustainable technologies, demonstrate the industry’s commitment to innovation. Reducing emissions, both CO2 and non-CO2 is more than just a technological challenge. It’s an opportunity to rethink the materials, processes, and designs that define modern aviation.",https://aviationglass.aero/wp-json/yootheme/image?src=%7B%22file%22%3A%22wp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F02%2FKopie-van-Posts-AGT-935-x-622-px.jpg%22%2C%22thumbnail%22%3A%22610%2C%2C%22%7D&hash=52765195,N,,2025-03-07 11:01:49.672816

In concrete terms, this means that we will qualify and apply sustainable carbon fibre composites to our race cars during the 2025 Formula 1 season, without sacrificing any on-track performance.

Carbon fibre composites form approximately 75% of our race car materials, helping us to achieve the highest levels of performance and safety. Innovations in these materials provide a significant opportunity to reduce the carbon footprint of our car, supporting our goal to achieve Net Zero across all scopes by 2040.

Carbon fibre composites are primarily formed of two key components: the fibres and the resin system. By weight, approximately 60% of the composite material is formed of fibres, with 40% made up by the resin system. Impregnating the fibres with the resin system, followed by curing, creates a lightweight material with outstanding mechanical performance necessary to meet the unforgiving demands of Formula 1.

Working closely with the FIA within the scope of the relevant regulations, we aim to demonstrate that sustainable carbon fibre composites can perform to the same technically demanding requirements as traditional materials.

To qualify a carbon fibre composite material for use on the race car, it must undergo rigorous laboratory testing to provide understanding of its technical properties and performance. Transferring from the lab to the racetrack requires further trials and verification to ensure the material behaviour aligns with expectations.

The identification and subsequent qualification of sustainable materials solutions would not be possible without the continuous innovation and ongoing support of our supply chain; each carbon fibre composite component involves four to eight suppliers to deliver the final product.

To achieve a sustainable carbon fibre composite, both components – the fibres and the resin system – must be addressed. Working collaboratively with our supply chain, the team has two separate projects underway for introduction later this year, one of which will address the resin system and one the carbon fibres themselves.

Formula 1 is the world’s fastest test lab and these innovations represent the latest step in our transition towards a more sustainable sport. As a team, we are committed to pursuing sustainable high performance. We were the first global sports team to invest in and help scale the market for Sustainable Aviation Fuel and in 2024, we successfully powered our European season using HVO100 biofuel.

Our work on these pioneering sustainable materials projects in Formula 1 provides a significant opportunity to scale this innovation beyond motorsport. Innovation drives performance, and these developments can shape industry futures from aviation and aerospace to technical performance fabrics.

Toto Wolff, Team Principal and CEO, Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team: “When you combine performance and innovation, you create progress. I am proud to lead a team of problem solvers who are committed to driving sustainable change. I would like to thank our partners for supporting our drive for material innovation, and to the FIA for enabling us to test these materials. Collectively we are moving the dial on sustainable products and demonstrating that Formula 1 continues to be the fastest laboratory in the world.”

Alice Ashpitel, Head of Sustainability, Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team: “We are proud to be at the forefront of sustainable innovation within our sport. Leadership must be driven by innovation and our team’s efforts in this space are the latest demonstration of our ambition to become one of the world’s most sustainable global sports teams.

Through this partnership, Cluj International Airport and OMV Petrom reaffirm their commitment to supporting the energy transition and adopting of sustainable solutions in the aviation sector.

Starting January 2025, aircrafts taking off from Cluj airport, the second largest airport in Romania, are being fuelled with aviation fuel mixed with 2% SAF, thus reducing the environmental impact. Nearly 1,800 flights were operated in January and February using this fuel, covering all departures from the airport.

“We are proud to contribute to the introduction of sustainable aviation fuel at Cluj International Airport. SAF is produced from renewable raw materials such as vegetable oils and animal fats, transformed into fuels with properties similar to conventional kerosene using innovative technologies. At OMV Petrom, we have started construction works on a EUR 750 million investment so that, starting 2028, we can produce such fuels in Romania, at the Petrobrazi refinery. We believe in Romania’s potential to become a regional hub for such fuels,” said Radu Căprău, member of the OMV Petrom Executive Board responsible for Refining and Marketing.

„Together with our supplier OMV Petrom, we have managed to initiate the process by which the aircrafts operating flights at Cluj International Airport will be fueled with sustainable aviation fuels. This is another important goal we have achieved to fulfill our commitments to reduce carbon emissions and support less polluting air transport,” said David Ciceo, General Manager of Cluj International Airport.

With nearly 3.3 million passengers in 2024, Avram Iancu Airport in Cluj is the largest regional airport in Romania and the second largest airport in the country, after Otopeni. As part of efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, in addition to supplying sustainable aviation fuel, the airport has also acquired two electric aircraft de-icing/anti-icing vehicles and an electric bus to ensure passengers’ transport from the terminal to the planes.

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are fuels produced by processing renewable raw materials, such as used oils and animal fats. Using advanced refining processes and green hydrogen, these materials are transformed to have characteristics similar to conventional kerosene. SAF can be dropped straight into existing infrastructure and aircraft. It has the potential to provide a lifecycle carbon reduction of up to 80% compared to the traditional jet fuel it replaces. SAF will play a really important role in meeting the aviation industry’s carbon reduction targets.

The ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates the use of sustainable aviation fuels on European Union airports in a minimum proportion of 2% starting January 1, 2025, with a gradual increase in the use of SAF up to 6% by 2030.",,N,,2025-03-07 07:16:05.312238

The return of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency has created uncertainty for the sustainable development of aviation and airports in America. The aviation industry’s ambitious target to achieve net zero by 2050, crucially relies on the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

In 2022, then President Joe Biden passed the Inflation Reduction Act. It included a tax credit for SAF production, of $1.25 for each gallon from a qualified mixture[1]. Almost $300 million in investment towards SAF and technologies, and the establishment of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge which aimed to scale up SAF production to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 50%; produce three billion gallons of SAF by 2030; and support 100% of domestic aviation fuel demand by 2050.

Under the Biden Administration (2021-2025) SAF took off. SAF production grew from 2021 of five million gallons to 93 million gallons in the first three-quarters of 2024. More than 750,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent to domestic GHG emission reductions occurred in 2024, compared to 50,000 in 2021.[2]

It is projected that SAF would continue to grow and become imperative in lowering aviation emissions in America, however, under Trump sweeping changes are already affecting production. On the first day of Trump’s second term, he froze Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, and signed the executive order Unleashing American Dominance, a less inclusive order for sustainable initiatives.

As of February 2025, CVR Energy Inc. announced that it has halted SAF production as it waits on government clarification on whether tax credits will continue. Though, on the other hand, the new administration approved a SAF refinery loan in Montana[3].

It seems SAF is entering a turbulent future, with many questions arising from the uncertainty that currently clouds it around achieving net zero.

Will the Trump administration stall SAF, or could it propel it to new heights?

What is SAF and why is it important?

Concisely, SAF is a fuel that can be produced from non-petroleum-based renewable feedstocks, including, but not limited to; the food and yard waste portion of municipal solid waste, woody biomass, fats/greases/oils, and other feedstocks. SAF can be blended at different levels with limits between 10% and 50%, depending on the feedstock and how the fuel is produced.[4]

The freeze on regulatory development is seen as a significant setback for the SAF industry.”

The benefits of SAF reveal how fundamental its production is for achieving net zero. The aviation industry accounts for 2.5% of global Co2 emissions, but it has contributed around 4% to global warming to date[5]. With SAF, however, it has the potential to lower flight emissions by 80%, compared to conventional jet fuel. It is also a drop-in fuel, meaning there is no need for modifying aircraft or constructing new fuelling stations. SAF produces fewer harmful pollutants and contains lower levels of sulphur and aromatic components, allowing aircraft engines to burn more cleanly and generate less pollution compared to conventional fuels.

Critical role of the 45Z Tax Credit

Fayaz Hussain, Editor of SAF Investor, stresses the importance of Biden’s 45Z tax credit, stating: “45Z is critical to development of SAF and includes incentives that have the potential to make or break projects as SAF is currently significantly more expensive compared to kerosene. Without the 45Z incentives, developers will have difficulty in selling SAF at high prices.” With the tax credit in limbo under the new administration, developers are hesitant to move forward with projects, as seen with CVR Energy.

The freeze on regulatory development is seen as a significant setback for the SAF industry. With SAF producers needing both federal and state-level incentives to bridge the price gap between SAF and traditional jet fuel, the future of the industry now hinges on how these incentives are shaped moving forward.

State-level incentives

Despite the federal uncertainty, state-level incentives have played a key role in keeping the SAF industry afloat. Washington, Illinois, and Minnesota, among other states, have implemented policies designed to encourage SAF production. Hussain highlights the importance of both state and federal incentives in creating an “incentive stack” that is necessary to scale up SAF production. He explains: “Federal and state-level incentives are key to achieving the desired incentive stack to scale SAF. At the moment, SAF producers need both incentives to have the desired stack to plug the massive gaps between kerosene and SAF prices.”

As countries like the UK and EU implement clear mandates and aggressive policies for SAF, the U.S. risks falling behind unless it solidifies its commitment to SAF production and development.”

These state-level policies are crucial in sustaining the momentum in SAF production, especially in the face of federal regulatory freezes and uncertainty. However, the real challenge lies in ensuring that the incentives at both the federal and state levels are aligned to achieve the scale needed to meet the aviation sector’s future fuel demands.

Can the U.S. still achieve its target of three billion gallons by 2030?

The Biden Administration set an ambitious goal of producing three billion gallons of SAF by 2030, a target that now faces the possibility of being derailed. Despite the recent setbacks, there is still hope that the target can be met, as the U.S. has already announced a SAF production pipeline expected to yield between 2.6 billion and 4.9 billion gallons by 2030. However, as Hussain points out, the uncertainty surrounding incentives could alter this forecast. “Any uncertainty around the incentives has the potential to change this forecast,” he says. The recent pause by CVR Energy is just one example of how political instability can disrupt the growth of the industry.

It’s clear that without a supportive policy, the U.S. may face challenges in meeting its production targets for SAF. The polarised politics only exacerbates the uncertainty, leaving industry stakeholders with more questions than answers about the long-term outlook for SAF.

Could Trump propel SAF with corn-based Ethanol?

One area that Trump could benefit SAF is the potential for corn-based Ethanol to become a dominant feedstock. Given Trump’s focus on rural economic priorities (states/areas that typically vote Republican), there is speculation that corn-based ethanol could play a more significant role in SAF production. However, this pathway faces significant challenges. According to Hussain, “SAF produced from corn-to-Ethanol (alcohol-to-jet) pathway is significantly more expensive than that produced via HEFA [Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids] pathway. Although it is a viable pathway, the carbon intensity of corn-based Ethanol in the U.S. will have to come down before it can scale to the level needed to deliver volumes.”

Could the U.S fall behind the rest of the world?

The global SAF landscape is divided into two main approaches: the “stick” approach, used by the UK and the EU, which mandates SAF production with civil penalties in place for those who don’t comply, and the “carrot” approach employed by the U.S., which focuses on incentives to stimulate growth. Hussain is concerned that the U.S. could lose its competitive edge if it fails to stabilise its policies. “The current U.S. Administration has yet to issue its stance on goals for the SAF industry during its term. This will ultimately determine whether the U.S. will emerge as a leader in SAF production or lose ground to other countries.”

As countries like the UK and EU implement clear mandates and aggressive policies for SAF, the U.S. risks falling behind unless it solidifies its commitment to SAF production and development.

Conclusion

The future of SAF production in the U.S. hangs in the balance, caught between political uncertainty, regulatory freezes, and the critical need for incentives. The 45Z tax credit remains a cornerstone, and without it, SAF projects will stall. At the same time, state-level incentives provide some relief, but the need for a co-ordinated federal policy remains critical. As the Trump administration’s freeze on key regulations and incentives continues, and regressive policies for sustainability are implemented, it seems likely that SAF production will experience major setbacks, making it increasingly difficult for the aviation industry to meet its ambitious goals. Without stable and supportive federal policies, the U.S. may fall short of its target of three billion gallons by 2030, stalling progress towards net zero emissions in aviation. The uncertainty surrounding the future of SAF production under the Trump administration could ultimately delay or even derail efforts to significantly reduce aviation emissions, putting the aviation industry’s 2050 net-zero goal at risk.

Boeing investment will support development of one of Europe’s first industrial-scale Power-to-Liquids facility

Boeing [NYSE: BA] has become a key project development partner of Norsk e-Fuel, supporting one of Europe’s first industrial scale Power-to-Liquids (PtL) facilities. Boeing’s investment will accelerate the production and availability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the Nordics and globally. It is also intended to support the commercial aviation industry’s and ICAO member states’ common goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Norsk e-Fuel will produce jet fuel known as electro-SAF, or e-SAF. This involves the PtL process: using fossil-free power to generate green hydrogen and combining it with recycled CO₂ from biogenic sources. This fuel can reduce the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of air travel by over 90% compared to conventional jet fuel.

“Our support of and collaboration with Norsk e-Fuel underscores the importance of using fossil-free energy to accelerate SAF production, which is key to reducing aviation’s carbon emissions towards 2050,” said Steve Gillard, Boeing’s regional sustainability director for Europe, Middle East, Türkiye, Africa and Central Asia. “Our partnership to advance e-fuels will help mobilize the commercialization of SAF in the Nordics and across the world, increasing accessibility and availability for our customers as we help build a robust SAF ecosystem.”

It is estimated that SAF accounted for only 0.53% of the global commercial fuel use in 2024. In Europe, the RefuelEU SAF initiative’s proposed mandate aims to gradually increase the share of SAF, reaching a target of 6% by 2030, and 70% by 2050. There are also sub-mandates for e-SAF, such as that produced by Norsk e-Fuel, with targets of 1.2% in 2030 increasing to 35% in 2050.

Boeing’s investment will contribute to achieving the SAF volumes needed by the EU commitments and strengthen national energy security across the Nordics. The partnership will also inform policies that enable the economic viability of the global SAF industry, while supporting long-term competitiveness of the aviation industry in the region.

“Our goal is to make e-fuels competitive with and eventually replace fossil fuels in critical infrastructures as SAF needs to become readily accessible and affordable for advancing aviation’s decarbonization,” said Lars Bjørn Larsen, CCO of Norsk e-Fuel. “Boeing’s investment will further accelerate our project pipeline and will facilitate the broader aviation industry’s transition to net-zero emissions.”

The strategic partnership combines Boeing’s SAF industry leadership and fuels expertise with Norsk e-Fuel’s technology know-how and strong network of partners, including Norway’s largest air carrier, Norwegian.

“We are pleased to welcome Boeing on board. Their investment marks a significant milestone for Norsk e-Fuel and confirms the positive development we have had. We look forward to leveraging Boeing’s expertise and experience in the development and growth of this pioneering industry. This investment also reinforces the need for a supportive policy environment to fully realise the potential of e-fuels production in Norway, in line with the Norwegian parliament’s call,” said Geir Karlsen, CEO of Norwegian.
