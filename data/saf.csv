The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced that this tax will apply to flights booked from April 1, 2026, for departures from Singapore starting October 1, 2026.

Han Kok Juan, director-general of CAAS, emphasized that this initiative is a significant advancement in making Singapore a more sustainable and competitive air hub. He stated that the levy offers aviation users a manageable way to contribute to sustainability efforts. “We need to make a start,” he said, indicating that the authority is providing ample time for industry players, businesses, and the public to adapt to these changes.

The SAF Levy’s implementation aligns with the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) goal for net-zero carbon emissions in the aviation sector by 2050. Singapore aims to reduce domestic airport emissions by 20% from 2019 levels by 2030 as part of its sustainable aviation plan.

The CAAS explained that the levy is calculated based on the expected volume of sustainable aviation fuel required to meet a 1% target for 2026 along with the projected price premium of SAF compared to conventional jet fuel. Consequently, the charge will vary depending on the distance of the flight and the fuel consumption anticipated for that route.

Travellers on flights departing Singapore will see a separate tax charge on their ticket receipts. However, those simply transiting through Singapore or transferring between airlines will not incur additional fees. The levy structure categorizes destinations into four geographic groups based on distance, and the fees differ for economy and premium cabin passengers. For example, flights to South-East Asia in economy will see an additional charge of just SGD 1 (approximately $1.18), while economy fare passengers heading to Australia will be charged SGD 3.30, rising to SGD 13.21 for premium cabin seats. Most notably, those flying in business or first class to the Americas will face the highest surcharge of SGD 49.08.

As air travel begins to rebound in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Australian statistics indicate a marked increase in visitors from Singapore. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported a growth in short-term visitors, with 39,590 entering Australia from Singapore as of September this year, a sharp increase from prior years.

Additionally, the SAF Levy will apply to cargo shipping costs through Singapore. Shipping charges will range from SGD 0.01 to SGD 0.15 per kilogram depending on geographic categories, and private jet operators will face fees between SGD 47.19 and SGD 7,668 based on aircraft type and size.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is recognized for its capacity to significantly reduce carbon emissions—by up to 80%—and can be produced from various renewable sources, ensuring it does not compete with food supply chains. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF utilizes biomass that has absorbed CO2 during its lifecycle, thus recycling carbon rather than adding to overall emissions.

While Australia has not yet adopted a mandatory sustainable fuel tax, the local aviation sector is encouraged to aim for emissions reduction. Qantas, Jetstar, and Virgin Australia currently provide options for passengers to voluntarily offset their carbon emissions but lack enforced sustainability costs. However, industry experts, such as Neil Hansford, predict that the Australian government will closely observe the effectiveness of Singapore’s SAF Levy, potentially paving the way for similar measures in Australia.

The latest developments in Australia’s aviation sustainability efforts include a notable commitment from the federal government, which has earmarked $1.1 billion to promote the production of low-carbon fuels, including a specific Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative. The Australian government foresees the first cleaner fuels produced by 2029, aiming to gradually replace traditional fossil fuels.

In summary, Singapore’s SAF Levy reflects a pioneering approach to aviation sustainability, and as international focus on emission reductions intensifies, Australia must navigate its policies on sustainable aviation to remain competitive while aiming for reduced environmental impact.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Singapore-to-Introduce-World-First-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-Tax-for-Flights.jpeg,N,,2025-11-21 12:56:15.038558

The second day of IAS2025 explored how airport leaders are navigating turbulence, embracing automation and delivering inclusive, data-driven passenger experiences.

Airport executives share strategies for leading through turbulence and growth

Day two opened with a keynote panel moderated by Chris Woodroofe, Managing Director of Manchester Airport, featuring senior leaders Sigrún Björk Jakobsdóttir, CEOof Isavia Regional Airports Iceland and Laila Odina, CEO of Riga Airport. The discussion explored how airports are adapting to rising passenger volumes, ageing infrastructure and shifting commercial dynamics, including the paradox of increased footfall but declining per-passenger spend.

Speakers highlighted that resilience now depends on organisational agility as much as infrastructure planning. Geopolitical shocks, volatile transfer markets and natural disruptions such as volcanos require flexible horizons rather than rigid masterplans. Both airports noted the complexity of refurbishing legacy terminals, where hidden conditions and outdated documentation often make upgrades more costly and disruptive than new builds.

The panel stressed disciplined asset management, digital documentation and frank dialogue on funding and realistic returns. Leadership through turbulence, they agreed, demands clarity, strong middle-management capability and constant recalibration to keep airports functioning as vital economic engines.

Reinventing check-ins for speed and convenience

In a fireside chat moderated by Mats Berglind, Innovation Manager, Swedavia, Borry Vrieling (Eezeetags) and Doug Wycoff (Tampa International Airport) examined why check-in remains one of the most outdated, friction-heavy parts of the passenger journey and why modernisation is critical for capacity, commercial performance and satisfaction. While technology for biometrics, self-service bag drops and AI queue management exists, adoption has been slow, leaving processes largely unchanged for decades.

Speakers urged airports to design around human behaviour, not technology, noting that most travellers are stressed and want to “exhale” after security. Seamless check-in drives retail engagement and dwell-time opportunities, while clean facilities and intuitive wayfinding boost commercial returns. The vision ahead is decentralised, data-driven and nearly invisible, with remote bag-drop at hotels, stations and curbside. Though regulatory and infrastructure hurdles remain, the business case is strong: fewer staffed desks reshape terminal design and redeploy staff into passenger care, improving experience and revenue.

Net zero aviation powered by game-changing tech

This panel moderated by Maurice Jenkins, Chief Innovation Officer of Miami International brought together Chris Woodroofe, MD of Manchester Airport, Giampiero Goretti, Head of energy Management and Decarbonisation at Aeroporti di Roma and Rachel Gardner-Poole OBE, Sustainable Aviatin Consultant for NATS to examine the technologies shaping aviation’s decarbonisation journey. The discussion focused on sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), carbon capture, AI-driven efficiency and the regulatory and investment challenges ahead.

Speakers stressed that airports face a dual challenge: transforming energy systems, fleets and infrastructure while maintaining commercial viability. Aeroporti di Roma outlined its roadmap to net zero, positioning airports as energy producers through renewables and smart grids. Manchester Airport warned that unco-ordinated transitions risk “green bottlenecks”, citing grid constraints during rapid electrification.

The panel agreed there is no single fuel solution: SAF is vital but scarce, hydrogen and electrification have limits, and airspace modernisation offers major carbon savings. Ultimately, decarbonisation demands system-wide change, rapid innovation and collaboration—turning airports into energy hubs and operationally agile leaders in sustainability.

Accessibility revolution: inclusive tech takes centre stage

Al Titterington, Terminal Operations Director, Birmingham Airport moderated a panel featuring Darrell Watson, Senior Vice President & Chief Experience Officer Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport and Michele Parietti, Head of PRM Assistance from SEA Milan Airports, showcasing innovations that transform accessibility from a niche service into a core passenger experience priority. With PRM volumes rising rapidly and encompassing physical, sensory and hidden needs, speakers urged airports to embed accessibility into every design decision rather than retrofitting solutions.

Louisville highlighted its GoodMaps app, which uses LiDAR to deliver precise indoor navigation for blind and low-vision travellers without requiring airport infrastructure—boosting autonomy and reducing assisted-travel costs. Milan discussed autonomous wheelchairs, sensory-friendly spaces and redesigning high-failure touchpoints to meet surging demand.

The panel stressed that technology must enable complete journeys, not partial fixes, and that autonomy is the new benchmark for service quality. Inclusive design and integrated systems, they concluded, will define future terminals and deliver better airports for all passengers.

Carbon-neutral baggage handling systems

In this session experts from Brussels Airport, Heathrow and Forbo explored how airports can cut emissions and energy use in baggage handling systems without compromising performance.

Forbo showcased low-friction conveyor components that reduce mechanical resistance, cutting energy consumption, heat generation and cooling needs, while enabling recycled or bio-based PVC. Heathrow emphasised embedding efficiency at the design stage, moving from legacy systems to demand-driven conveyor flows that operate only when bags are moving. This approach supports waste heat recovery, LED lighting and advanced monitoring to identify energy losses.

The panel agreed that carbon-neutral BHS is achievable through smarter materials, optimised layouts and continuous monitoring. Incremental innovations such as off-site processing and intelligent routing can deliver measurable reductions today, while rising passenger awareness strengthens the commercial case. Collaboration across suppliers, airports and operators will be key to future-proofing baggage infrastructure.

Robotics and autonomy address workforce shortages

A panel moderated by Henk Brandsma Strategic Process Developer Baggage, Airport Operations, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol explored how airports are deploying robotics and AI to tackle labour shortages, improve efficiency and enhance passenger experience. Speakers from Fraport, Aena and Vienna Airport shared real-world applications, including autonomous wheelchairs, ramp inspection robots, document delivery systems and condition-monitoring units.

Aena highlighted autonomous wheelchairs at Madrid-Barajas and ramp inspection robots, while Vienna showcased VR training for ramp staff and robots for interdepartmental document transport. Frankfurt Airport demonstrated wheelchairs capable of announcements and navigation in tight spaces, alongside robots performing terminal checks.

The discussion stressed that automation complements human expertise rather than replacing it. Staff engagement, training and change management are critical for adoption, while passenger trials show strong acceptance. Despite infrastructure challenges, robotics is delivering measurable gains in safety, efficiency and service quality, signalling a future where human-machine collaboration becomes central to airport operations.

AI that sees the future: predictive maintenance in action

This session explored how airports are using AI and real-time sensor data to predict failures, reduce downtime and optimise resources. Doug Wycoff (Tampa International) and Leif Johnson (Bentley) emphasised that the breakthrough lies not in adding sensors but in leveraging existing data for actionable insights.

Tampa International showcased AI-driven crowd management and facility monitoring, which cut staffing needs and improved passenger flow, while predictive smoke detection in car parks now provides 10–15 minutes of extra lead time. Bentley highlighted contextualised data as the key to success, enabling systems to correlate asset history, vibration patterns and energy use to trigger work orders before failures occur.

The panel stressed that predictive maintenance is a cultural shift, requiring trust, phased rollouts and strong data governance. Airports that treat AI as an operational evolution rather than an IT project will see the fastest and most sustainable returns.

Smart tech optimising every inch of the airport

Thomas Romig, COO of Brussels Airport moderated a panel featuring Edmonton, Aeroporti di Roma, +Impact and Synaptic Aviation, focusing on AI-driven tools that deliver measurable gains in airport operations. The discussion highlighted intelligent stand allocation, turnaround optimisation and frontline service enhancements.

+Impact showcased real-time translation and mobile tools that empower staff to resolve passenger queries instantly while generating valuable operational data. Synaptic Aviation demonstrated computer-vision monitoring for turnarounds, reducing delays and improving safety through transparent, unbiased records. Edmonton shared its rollout of generative AI tools across 60 teams, freeing staff from manual tasks and accelerating access to policies and documentation. Rome outlined its dual approach: deploying proven solutions and building in-house systems for apron monitoring and passenger engagement.

The panel concluded that AI’s greatest impact lies in augmenting people, not replacing them. Success depends on robust digital infrastructure, change management and treating AI as a people-centred transformation.

Transforming the passenger experience from curb to gate

This fireside chat with Kerry Skelly (Aerocloud) and Roland Böhm (Berlin Airport) explored how AI and real-time data are reshaping airport operations and passenger experience. The discussion highlighted predictive queue management, dynamic resource planning and the potential for personalised journeys, while addressing GDPR compliance and scalability for smaller airports.

AeroCloud emphasised privacy-by-design in AI flow modelling, while Berlin Brandenburg shared early successes with AI-driven security and turnaround optimisation. Both speakers outlined a future where airports actively “pull” passengers through checkpoints based on real-time capacity and preferences, reducing queues and improving dwell-time opportunities.

The panel stressed that personalisation must remain optional, supported by clear signage and staff assistance. Long-term, digital travel credentials could eliminate check-in entirely, freeing terminal space for revenue-generating uses. The message was clear: AI is becoming a structural enabler of seamless travel, but trust, transparency and robust infrastructure are essential.

Radar technology keeping skies safe

This session explored how advanced radar is transforming wildlife hazard management at Berlin Brandenburg Airport. Sibylle Giraud (Robin Radar Systems) and Christian Miersch (Berlin Airport) highlighted how real-time monitoring and deterrents are reducing bird strike risks and improving operational resilience.

Berlin’s upgrade from Robin Radar’s Flex to Max system delivered a step-change in precision, enabling altitude tracking and faster refresh rates to identify genuine conflicts with aircraft operations. The panel stressed that radar is not a replacement for human expertise but a force multiplier, extending situational awareness across BER’s 1,500-hectare footprint and guiding deterrents with greater accuracy.

Long-term data emerged as a key benefit, allowing airports to analyse seasonal patterns, evaluate habitat strategies and justify safety investments. Looking ahead, sensor fusion combining bird and drone detection promises unified situational awareness. The takeaway: high-fidelity radar is now essential for mitigating wildlife risks and demonstrating due diligence.

Securing the skies with cutting-edge security tech

Moderated by Oliver Braun, Head of Security at Berlin Airport this panel examined how airports are responding to escalating drone threats.

Speakers warned that drone incursions have evolved from hobbyist activity to sophisticated, state-level tactics, with recent incidents at Brussels Airport causing multimillion-euro disruptions. The panel stressed that single-sensor detection is no longer viable; airports need layered systems combining RF, radar, acoustic and camera analytics to confirm threats and restore operations quickly.

Legislative gaps remain a major challenge, with fragmented responsibilities across airports, ANSPs and law enforcement. Panellists called for stronger national coordination and investment in multi-sensor platforms that can also support wildlife monitoring and airfield inspections. The message was clear: counter-drone capability is now essential for operational resilience, requiring proactive planning, clear authority and rapid stakeholder collaboration.

Recently, new orders have been secured from ANA (18 aircraft), Malaysia Airlines (60), and Japan Airlines (50).
Stanley emphasized sustainability as a key differentiator, noting that new Airbus aircraft deliver 25% better fuel efficiency, with the company working toward 100% sustainable aviation fuel capability.
“Asia Pacific is not by coincidence a focus market,” Meijer emphasized.","At the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines’ 69th Assembly of Presidents in Bangkok held November 14-16, 2025, leading aircraft manufacturers presented their forecasts for what they’re calling the industry’s biggest growth opportunity in years.

Boeing, Airbus, and Embraer each laid out ambitious plans for what’s shaping up to be aviation’s most dramatic growth story over the next two decades.

The numbers being discussed speak of staggering growth in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region: tens of thousands of new aircraft needed, trillions in economic value, and growth rates that dwarf every other region.

However, the manufacturers presenting these rosy forecasts are the same ones currently running months or even years behind on deliveries. Adding tens of thousands of orders to already stretched production lines won’t make things any easier.

Boeing: Banking on Southeast Asia’s 7% growth

Dave Schulte, Boeing’s Managing Director for APAC Marketing, emphasized Southeast Asia’s massive potential, reckoning that the region needs 4,885 new aircraft over the next 20 years, split between 3,975 single-aisle jets and 910 widebodies.

“We’re forecasting 7% annual growth—the fastest in the world alongside South Asia,” Schulte explained, noting that the region’s middle class has doubled over 25 years and currently shows no signs of slowing.

But Boeing faces a challenge it readily admits: a global shortfall of 1,500 aircraft that should already have been delivered, but weren’t. “Airlines used to plan five or six years out. Now they have to plan 10, even 15 years into the future,” Schulte observed, highlighting how the supply crunch is reshaping the industry.

The company is betting on its 737 MAX family, claiming that one takes off or lands every 12-13 seconds globally. Recently, new orders have been secured from ANA (18 aircraft), Malaysia Airlines (60), and Japan Airlines (50).

Airbus: betting on APAC’s billion-strong middle class

Airbus President APAC Anand Stanley presented even larger numbers, forecasting nearly 20,000 new passenger aircraft needed across the broader Asia-Pacific region, representing 46% of global demand.

“All of this ends up making Asia Pacific one of the most successful commercial and economic stories, one of the largest consumer markets in the world,” Stanley stated, pointing to GDP growth of 3.4% annually and an expanding middle class of one billion people.

The European manufacturer projects demand for 16,000 single-aisle aircraft and 3,480 widebodies, with the region already operating the world’s largest widebody fleet at 900 units.

Stanley emphasized sustainability as a key differentiator, noting that new Airbus aircraft deliver 25% better fuel efficiency, with the company working toward 100% sustainable aviation fuel capability.

Recent wins include Qantas’s A350-1000 for Project Sunrise, the world’s longest commercial flights, plus new Asian customers such as EVA Air and Korean Air joining the A350 program.

Embraer: building a $10 billion business in the APAC regional market

While Boeing and Airbus battle over large jet orders, Embraer CEO Arjan Meijer sees massive opportunity in the regional segment. The Brazilian manufacturer forecasts APAC and China will need 3,390 aircraft in the up-to-150-seat category, the largest regional requirement globally.

“We hope to climb to a $10 billion company towards the end of the decade,” Meijer revealed, in light of a $50.2 billion commercial backlog.

Embraer’s strategy targets three specific opportunities: penetrating cost-conscious low-cost carriers with the E195-E2’s improved economics; replacing Asia’s 800 aging turboprops (37% of the global fleet); and expanding hub connectivity for major carriers. The company has already notched up wins with Virgin Australia, All Nippon Airways, and LATAM, pushing E2 commitments beyond 250 aircraft.

Unlike its larger rivals, Embraer is building ground-up infrastructure, establishing simulators in Singapore, plus warehouses with $100 million in parts, and strategic partnerships across the region. “Asia Pacific is not by coincidence a focus market,” Meijer emphasized.

Reality check: orders don’t fly, aircraft do

All three aircraft manufacturers are essentially betting their futures on the same forecast: Asia-Pacific is where industry action will be for the next 20 years.

However, the companies are already behind. Boeing admits they’re 1,500 aircraft short of where they should be, airlines are scrambling to lock in slots a decade out, and supply chain issues remain in place.",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/11/Untitled-design-20.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 11:56:45.784271

Food transportation bridges food and transportation systems. A study based on “food miles” concept revealed that, when considering the entire food supply chain, emissions from food transportation account for ~19% of global food system emissions2. This underscores the critical need for strategies aimed at mitigating emissions associated with food transportation, contributing co-benefits in decarbonizing both food system and transportation system.

With global population growth and an increasing demand for food, the amount of wastes generated by food system has risen sharply. Proper management of food system wastes has thus become a crucial aspect of controlling or mitigating emissions within food system3,4,5,6,7. The conversion of food system wastes into biofuels for transportation has already seen widespread application. Among food system wastes, used cooking oil (UCO) and crop residues (CRs) demonstrate advantages in collection and treatment efficiency, exhibiting more homogeneous compositions compared with other wastes such as kitchen waste. Additionally, the technologies for their conversion into biofuels are more mature, establishing them as primary feedstocks for biofuel production8,9,10,11. Biodiesel is the most common form of biofuels, primarily used in road, railway & inland waterway, and marine transportation12,13,14.

Established pathways for converting UCO include esterification-hydrogenation and Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) processes following hydrolysis15,16. Esterification-hydrogenation yields high-quality biodiesel suitable for road, rail, and inland waterway transport by effectively converting UCO fatty acids. HEFA technology, involving high-pressure hydrogenation, transforms UCO lipids into drop-in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), currently the dominant bio-aviation pathway, achieving higher energy density and combustion performance17,18,19,20. CRs can be converted via fast pyrolysis or gasification-Fischer-Tropsch synthesis21,22. Fast pyrolysis rapidly decomposes solid biomass into liquid bio-oil, while Fischer-Tropsch synthesis produces premium liquid fuels from syngas without requiring specific feedstock chemical structures, making it suitable for producing Fischer-Tropsch aviation fuel from lignocellulosic materials like CRs17,18,19,20. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is widely employed to compare different fuel technologies, with numerous studies demonstrating that biofuels, when replacing fossil fuels, result in significant emission reduction23,24,25. Regarding the collection and energy potential of CRs and UCO, a large number of research has estimated the amount of CRs available in different regions based on crop yields and residue indices26,27,28,29. When estimating the energy potential of CRs, it is crucial to account for competing uses beyond biofuel production30,31. Contextualized in the diverse ways of CRs utilization, and the influence of climate and dietary habits on their spatial distribution, extant research has conducted analysis of CRs’ competing uses targeting typical countries or regions32,33,34. Studies on UCO recycling predominantly address collection and transportation strategies at the consumption end35,36. Unlike CRs, which have multiple competing uses, the main energy utilization pathway for UCO is biodiesel production34,35,36,37. Various conversion technologies have been examined to explore UCO’s potential for biofuel production38,39,40,41.

Building on studies of food system wastes’ energy potentials, some research has also analyzed the emission reduction benefits of biofuel production from food system wastes in specific regions. Typical studies cover estimates of the emission reduction potential of biodiesel produced from CRs in Europe for use in marine transportation42, assessment of the bioenergy potential and emission reduction contributed by CRs utilization in China43, analysis of the environmental impacts of converting UCO to biodiesel in China44, and evaluation of the emission reduction effect of biodiesel produced from UCO in Iran under specific UCO recycling strategies45. These studies further demonstrate the potential of utilizing wastes-derived biofuels for controlling transportation emissions in practical applications.

While converting food system wastes to biofuels has demonstrated effectiveness in fossil fuel substitution and emission reduction, critical knowledge gaps remain. First, from a food system perspective, the energy and environmental benefits feedback achievable by repurposing such biofuels specifically for food transportation remains unclear. Second, existing research lacks an integrated analytical framework that concurrently addresses global variations in food system wastes availability and disparate food transportation fuel demands across countries. Consequently, the extent to which domestically produced biofuels can offset heterogeneous transportation fossil fuel demands remains unknown, hindering the characterization of individual countries’ contributions to decarbonizing global food and transportation systems.

To address these gaps, this study establishes an internal recycling loop within the food system where food system waste streams are repurposed for food transportation. It aims to quantify national-level biofuel production potentials from such wastes and evaluate the corresponding contribution in decarbonizing food system transportation by substituting fossil fuels. The internal recycling loop within food system is illustrated in Fig. 1, the food system spans five sequential stages: agricultural production, food transportation and trade, processing and transformation, retail and provisioning, and food consumption. UCO and CRs generated from these stages are collected and processed into biofuels. These biofuels then substitute fossil fuels across various transportation modes (road, railway & inland waterway, marine, aviation), providing energy for food transportation while reducing emissions within the food system. Though biofuel utilization may extend beyond food-related transportation in practice, emerging carbon trading mechanisms and global carbon market developments enable the reallocation of environmental benefits to food systems through carbon quota allocations or fiscal incentives46,47. This approach creates synergistic feedback between emission reductions in the transportation sector and sustainability improvements in food production chains.

From the food system internal loop perspective, targeting 130 countries in the world, the availability and biofuel production potentials of CRs and UCO in various countries are accounted, combined with examining country-specific fossil fuel demands of food transportation adopting multiregional input-output model (MRIO). On this basis, four scenarios are designed to analyze the biofuel production and emission reduction contributions under varying food system wastes utilization levels (scenario of sole UCO utilization, scenario of sole CRs utilization, scenario of UCO and CRs co-utilization, and scenario of maximum biofuel production potential). The life cycle analysis and GREET (greenhouse gases, regulated emissions, and energy use in transportation) model are combined to compare the well-to-wheel/haul/wake (WTW/WTH/WTWa) emissions from typical biofuels and fossil fuels under the four scenarios, including emissions from the production phase (well-to-pump, WTP) and the operation phase (pump-to-wheel/haul/wake, PTW/PTH/PTWa). The findings are expected to provide references for informing global energy utilization strategies of food system wastes, and sustainability of food transportation.

Fossil fuel demand of global food transportation

Analysis of this study reveals that the aggregate food transportation fossil fuel demand across 130 countries amounts to around 3.0 EJ (1 EJ = 1018 J), constituting 3.3% of total transportation fossil fuel demand. Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of food transportation fossil fuel demands across various transportation modes. As one of the world’s preeminent food producers and consumers, China exhibits substantially higher food transportation fossil fuel demand compared with other countries. Similarly, other major food-producing countries, including India, Brazil, the United States, and Russia, demonstrate elevated demand, while the African and Middle Eastern countries show comparatively lower demand. Among four transportation modes, road transportation dominates the fossil fuel demand, accounting for ~80.6% of total demand across 130 countries. Aviation and marine transport follow with 8.4% and 7.4% respectively. Railway & inland waterway transportation exhibits significantly lower fossil fuel dependence (3.6% combined), primarily due to the higher electrification levels of railway. Regionally, railway & inland waterway fuel demands are concentrated in China, Latin America, and the Middle East, with China and Russia recording elevated shares of 8.86% and 6.25% respectively. Notably, archipelagic and coastal countries like the Philippines, Brunei, and Indonesia demonstrate exceptional marine fossil fuel intensity, with marine transportation constituting over 20% of their national fossil fuel consumption.

Biofuel production from food system wastes

This study suggests that the theoretically maximum biofuel production from UCO across 130 countries reaches 0.41 EJ (1.03%), while CRs-derived biofuels exhibit an overwhelmingly higher potential of 38.77 EJ (98.97%). This disparity arises because CRs possess inherent advantages in sheer amount, being inevitable agricultural byproducts with broad geographical distribution. While UCO, despite its higher conversion efficiency, is constrained by limited waste oil availability and immature collection infrastructure. These limitations collectively restrict UCO’s total biofuel production potential far below that of CRs. Figure 3 delineates the biofuel production from UCO and CRs across countries, revealing that those with higher food production and consumption demonstrate correspondingly greater potentials. Regionally, for UCO-derived biofuel production, China (106.8 PJ, 1 PJ = 1015 J) and the United States (100.0 PJ) collectively contribute 51.0% of the global total, driven by their extensive food service industries and consumption patterns. Major oilseed-producing countries, including Indonesia (32.6 PJ), Malaysia (29.5 PJ), and India (15.8 PJ), form the secondary tier, contributing 19.2% of the global total and correlating with their expanding vegetable oil utilization in food processing sectors. For CRs-derived biofuel production, major agricultural countries demonstrate overwhelming advantages: China (10.7 EJ), the United States (8.2 EJ), India (7.6 EJ), and Brazil (6.4 EJ) collectively account for 55.2% of the total, supported by vast croplands and high-intensity farming systems. Other leading grain producers such as Russia and Argentina follow, with CRs-derived biofuel production surpassing 2 EJ.

The biofuel production from UCO and CRs varies significantly depending on their utilization rate (especially competing uses for CRs) and energy conversion efficiency. UCO demonstrates superior energy conversion efficiency compared with CRs (Table S5 in Supplementary Information), yielding higher biofuel production per unit of wastes (PJ). Figure 4 presents a comparative result between fossil fuel demand and biofuel production from UCO and CRs across 11 regions (divided according to World Oil Outlook from OPEC48, with clustering of countries by economic parity and geographic proximity) under four scenarios. Table S8 provides detailed country-specific data regarding the fossil fuel demand that could be satisfied by UCO and CRs-derived biofuels. In the scenario of sole UCO utilization, significant biofuel production is seen in Asia, OECD Americas, and Europe. In the scenario of sole CRs utilization, despite a 7% utilization limit, CRs show broader potential, with over a third of 130 countries fully covering their food transportation fossil fuel demand. This performance confirms CRs’ persistently superior biofuel production capacity relative to UCO, attributable to their fundamental advantage in sheer production amount. The scenario of UCO and CRs co-utilization outperforms sole-feedstock scenarios, meeting most food transportation fossil fuel demand except in the Middle East and Russia. In the scenario of maximum biofuel production potential, the biofuel production exceeds food transportation fossil fuel demand in most regions, with India and Latin America capable of meeting their entire transportation sector’s fossil fuel demand (Fig. S2).

Emission reductions in food transportation through food system wastes-derived biofuels

Total emissions from the production and use of fossil fuels in food transportation across 130 countries are 256.6 million metric tonnes (Mt) CO2. Figure 5 shows emission distributions across four transportation modes in 11 regions. Road transportation dominates the total emissions, contributing 204.7 Mt CO₂ (80.7% of emissions across four modes), followed by aviation and marine transportation with tied contributions (19.8 Mt CO₂, 7.8%). Railway & inland waterway transportation exhibits the lowest emissions at 9.2 Mt CO₂, accounting for only 3.7%. Regionally, China exhibits the highest emissions across all modes except marine transportation, with road transportation (48.5 Mt CO₂, 23.7% of global road transportation emissions) and railway & inland waterway transportation (4.9 Mt CO₂, 53.5% of global railway & inland waterway transportation emissions) being particularly significant. Other Asian regions, the Middle East, and Latin America collectively account for around half of marine transportation emissions, each exceeding 25 Mt CO₂. In aviation transportation, OECD European countries (31.95 Mt CO₂, 16.12% of global aviation transportation emissions) emerge as major contributors alongside China.

Each country exhibits distinct emission reduction profiles in food transportation by utilizing food system wastes-derived biofuels. Figure 6a–d illustrates country-specific emission reductions across scenarios, with details for 130 countries presented in Table S9. The scenario of sole UCO utilization achieves 28.9 Mt CO₂ reductions (11.4% of food transportation emissions), with emission reduction proportions in high UCO producers like Malaysia and Indonesia being as high as over 95%, while other countries mostly achieve reductions in the 0−20% range in this scenario. The scenario of sole CRs utilization achieves 119.1 Mt CO₂ reductions (47.0%), with China, India, Brazil, and the US contributing above half of total reductions. Approximately half of the analyzed countries attain over 50% reductions in their national emissions. The scenario of UCO and CRs co-utilization achieves 135.0 Mt CO₂ reductions (53.2%), nearly half of the analyzed countries could achieve complete offset of food transportation fossil fuel demand through food system wastes-derived biofuels, achieving 70%−83% emission reductions. Under the scenario of maximum biofuel production potential, reductions reach 174.9 Mt CO₂ (69.0%), with only 21 countries’ food transportation fossil fuel demands being incompletely offset by food system wastes-derived biofuels, and nearly 80% of countries achieving an emission reduction proportion over 70%.

For four transportation modes, UCO-derived biofuels excel in reducing emissions from road, railway & inland waterway, while CRs-derived biofuels are more effective for marine and aviation (Table S7). As road transportation accounts for the highest fuel demand among the four modes, UCO-derived biofuels generally achieve greater overall emission reductions per unit when implementing biofuel substitution according to fuel demand shares for four modes. Under the scenario of maximum biofuel production potential, road transportation demonstrates global leadership in emission reduction, achieving 130.8 Mt CO₂ reductions, constituting 76.9% of total food transportation emissions mitigation. Aviation and marine transportation follow with 17.3 Mt CO₂ (9.9%) and 16.7 Mt CO₂ (9.5%) reductions respectively, while railway & inland waterway transportation, constrained by existing electrification levels of railway, contribute marginally at 6.46 Mt CO₂ (3.7%). Figure 6e shows emission reduction proportions across regions, transportation modes, and scenarios. All countries exhibit consistent, substantial road transportation reductions, particularly in the scenario of maximum biofuel production potential. Emission reductions in marine transportation are concentrated in coastal and island regions (e.g., the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia), where marine transportation contributes up to 20% of national mitigation totals. Middle Eastern countries and Russia exhibit >30% mitigation enhancement under the scenario of maximum biofuel production potential compared to the scenario of UCO and CRs co-utilization, indicating that elevated

Uncertainty analysis

The calculations of fossil fuel demand, biofuel production, food transportation emissions, and emission reductions are rigorously examined using Monte Carlo analysis. The yield coefficients of CRs, along with the collection coefficients of CRs and UCO, determine the utilizable amount of food system wastes. The energy conversion coefficients of UCO and CRs, combined with their biofuel conversion coefficients, critically influence the amount of biofuel production. The fuel demand shares for four transportation modes directly govern fossil fuel demand across four transportation modes, which is essential for estimating fossil fuel emissions in food transportation. Additionally, WTW emission coefficients of biofuels and fossil fuels serve as pivotal parameters for quantifying emissions and emission reductions in food transportation. These key factors have therefore been incorporated into the uncertainty analysis of calculation outcomes.

The Monte Carlo method employs triangular distributions for parameter estimation, generating 10,000 independent simulations, with results aggregated using statistical indicators. As shown in Fig. 7, road transportation exhibits a broader uncertainty range in fossil fuel demand and emission calculations compared to other transportation modes, primarily due to its higher fuel demand share. The substantially greater utilizable amount of CRs relative to UCO amplifies uncertainty in the CRs derived-biofuel production potentials. Furthermore, the uncertainty ranges of emission reductions across the four scenarios increase incrementally with rising emission reduction levels, with the scenario of sole UCO utilization demonstrating a notably smaller uncertainty range than the other three scenarios.

Research remarks

Building upon the quantified global analysis of fossil fuel demand and emissions in food transportation across multiple countries, this study pioneers an internal recycling loop framework of food system. The study proposes converting food system wastes (UCO and CRs) into biofuels for food transportation, establishing a synchronized decarbonization pathway that simultaneously achieves waste valorization and dual-system (food-transportation) emission mitigation. This study reveals that most countries could completely satisfy their food transportation fuel demands while mitigating 174.9 Mt CO2 emission reductions (around 70%) by utilizing all available UCO and <20% of total CRs. The details of the research remarks are as follows.

Food transportation represents a critical intersection between food system and the transportation sector. The calculations of this study, when compared with the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report49,50,51, show that food transportation contributes 3.34% of food system emissions and 2.95% of transportation sector emissions, representing a shared source of emissions between these two systems. The results may be conservative as the emission calculations solely account for oil fuel and natural gas fuel amenable to substitution with biofuels, without considering electricity consumption in food transportation.

On this basis, this study proposes an internal recycling loop within the food system, whereby food system wastes are repurposed for food transportation applications. This approach offers dual benefits: alleviating the disposal burden and resource wasting associated with substantial food system wastes, while simultaneously reducing fossil fuel dependency in food transportation, thereby propelling food transportation decarbonization. While practical applications may see food system wastes-derived biofuels utilized across various transportation sectors rather than exclusively in food transportation, the evolving global carbon trading policies and carbon markets present opportunities for channeling energy and environmental benefits back to the food system through carbon quotas or economic incentives46,47.

Moving forward beyond previous studies conducted28,29,52, a global analysis comparing the biofuel production potentials is provided from waste streams of UCO and CRs, followed by the assessment of the extent to which these wastes-derived biofuels could meet food transportation fossil fuel demands. Building on this analysis, the potential emission reductions achievable through food system wastes-derived biofuels substitution are calculated and compared across different regions, countries, and transportation modes. This leads to the development of synchronized decarbonization strategies for both food and transportation systems. The findings aim to inform global food wastes utilization strategies, transportation emission mitigation approaches, and sustainable development of food system.

Matching food transportation fossil fuel demands with wastes-derived biofuels

This study reveals that total food transportation fossil fuel demand in 130 countries is 3.03 EJ, accounting for 3.27% of the transportation sector’s total demand. The demand patterns vary significantly across countries and transportation modes, with major food-producing and consuming countries like China, India, Brazil, and the US showing the highest demand. Road transportation dominates, reflecting its central role in food logistics. Regarding food system wastes availability and the biofuel production potential, the analysis indicates that UCO and CRs could theoretically provide 0.41 EJ and 38.77 EJ of energy respectively across 130 countries. Matching each country’s food transportation fossil fuel demand with food system waste-derived biofuels reveals that in the scenario of sole UCO utilization, UCO-derived biofuels could meet 13% of global food transportation fossil fuel demand. Countries rich in oil crops, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, could satisfy over 95% of their food transportation fossil fuel demands through UCO-derived biofuels. Under the scenario of sole CRs utilization, despite limiting availability to 7%, CRs-derived biofuels demonstrate significant potential, capable of meeting 65% of global food transportation fossil fuel demand. Except for the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Russia, most regions could satisfy over 50% of their fossil fuel demands, highlighting CRs’ substantial potential. The scenario of UCO and CRs co-utilization improves satisfaction rates of fossil fuel demand, meeting 72% of the global demand by leveraging UCO’s superior energy conversion efficiency and CRs’ yield advantages. Under the scenario of maximum biofuel production potential, most regions could achieve complete coverage of their food transportation fossil fuel demands, demonstrating the theoretical feasibility of food transport energy self-sufficiency within food systems.

Strategizing food transportation emission reductions through wastes-derived biofuels

Across the 130 studied countries, gradient emission reductions of 289, 1203, 1361, and 17490 thousand tonnes of CO2 are achievable under four scenarios, respectively. Road transportation fuel substitution contributes the majority of emission reductions across countries, particularly in those dominated by inland transportation such as the United States, China, and Russia. European and Asia-Pacific regions show greater advantages in marine and aviation transportation emission reductions. Railway emissions reduction potential through biofuel substitution is relatively lower due to increasing electrification. From the perspective of emission reduction from unit biofuel, consistent with existing technologies-focused research23,24,53,54,55, CRs-derived biofuels demonstrate superior performance in marine and aviation applications, while UCO-derived biofuels show advantages in road, railway & inland waterway applications. Ideally, countries should prioritize deploying CRs-derived biofuels in marine and aviation transportation while reserving limited UCO resources for road transportation.

However, considering practical availability, UCO collection systems are more developed and cost-effective than those for CRs. Technically, UCO-derived biofuels production processes like HEFA offer lower cost and higher energy conversion efficiency compared with CRs conversion technologies such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and pyrolysis. This study assumes domestic production and use of wastes-derived biofuels without considering their import and export. However, policy-wise initiatives like the RED II (Renewable Energy Recast)‘s double-counting mechanism for UCO-derived biodiesel in EU, China’s 13% VAT (value added tax) refund on UCO exports, and the United States Biodiesel Tax Credit may foster more stable international supply chains for UCO-derived biofuels in the future. For CRs, due to higher transportation costs, tend toward localized subsidization (e.g. under Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations, biofuel produced from CRs is eligible to receive a low-carbon credit of CAD 0.35 per liter56). Export restrictions in Southeast Asian countries and the EU’s CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism) requirements further limit cross-border CRs-derived fuels circulation, leading to predominantly regional usage.

Overall, for resource-limited countries, improving market mechanisms, implementing favorable biofuel import policies, and establishing reliable supply chains is recommended. Countries with abundant resources and mature collection technologies should enhance waste collection and biofuel production capabilities, particularly in China and the United States, where UCO collection and conversion technologies are advanced. These countries should focus on reducing CRs-derived biofuel production costs and enhancing their competitiveness to reduce market dependence on UCO-derived biofuels. Developing countries rich in resources but technically less advanced, such as Southeast Asian and South American countries, should prioritize improving waste collection systems and exporting feedstock to countries with mature biofuel production capabilities, leveraging their own resource advantages. Countries lacking both resources and technologies should promote international cooperation, introduce small-scale biofuel production facilities, and initially focus on local short-distance food transportation to improve local energy self-sufficiency.

From the global food system perspective, the evolution of global carbon trading market mechanisms has facilitated viable pathways for channeling transportation-related emission reduction benefits back into food systems, thereby enhancing the operational feasibility of circular economy approaches. Policymakers should refine and calibrate carbon trading mechanisms pertaining to food system wastes to achieve seamless integration of biofuel emission reduction benefits into food system cycles. Key initiatives include cross-sector offset mechanisms, allocating carbon credits to feedstock providers, and implementing carbon taxes on high-emission food transportation. These measures optimize resource allocation, prevent emission reduction benefits’ concentration, and strengthen global food system resilience. The strategic utilization of carbon markets to achieve internal recycling loop within food system aims to elevate biofuels beyond mere transportation decarbonization tools to become pivotal leverage points in strengthening global food system sustainability, to advance food systems toward an integrated paradigm of sustainable development that harmonizes climate action, food security, and equity.

Limitations and future research perspectives

This study has the following limitations and uncertainties. First, the availability of food system wastes is calculated theoretically by using residual coefficient and collection coefficient according to the type of wastes, without accounting for impacts of national variations in dietary habits and technological capabilities. Second, the allocation of food system wastes for biofuel production in food transportation relies on assumed scenarios, which is a discussion on the possibility of internal loop in food system rather than reflecting real-world application conditions. Third, when modeling fossil fuel substitution by biofuels, in order to reflect the impact of the uniform penetration of biofuels under the existing transportation structure, this study assumes that UCO and CRs prepare biofuels for each transportation mode according to the existing food transportation fuel demand shares. In practical applications, better emission reduction effects may be achieved through the optimization of fuel alternatives (such as priority in the aviation field).

In addition, several problems warrant investigation in future research endeavors. This study has primarily focused on two major pathways for biofuel production from food system wastes. However, additional waste streams within the food system, including kitchen waste and livestock manure, possess potential for conversion into biofuels through various processing technologies serving as additional substitutes for fossil fuels. The expansion of feedstock diversity in biofuel production from food system waste streams could potentially yield enhanced emission reduction outcomes in food transportation applications. Furthermore, a more precise confirmation of the actual utilization of diverse food system wastes will enhance the accuracy of energy supply and emission reduction calculations.

Methodological framework

To quantify the energy and emission reduction benefits of using food system wastes-derived biofuels within food transportation, this study establishes an internal loop within the food system, identifying the primary feedstocks for biofuel production as UCO and CRs generated from agricultural production, food processing and transformation, and food consumption. CRs’ availability is calculated based on crop production data from the FAO database, combined with yield coefficients and collection coefficients of CRs from existing studies (Table S3). UCO’s availability is estimated using edible vegetable oil consumption data derived from the FAO database and region-specific statistics on UCO collection (Table S4).

After determining the maximum availability of CRs and UCO, their total energy potentials are calculated using crop-specific energy conversion coefficients for CRs from existing literature and the lower heating value for UCO from the GREET database (Table S3, Table S4). Then the GREET model is employed to account for the maximum amount of biofuel that can be produced by CRs and UCO (Table S5). Four scenarios are then constructed (see details in the following “Assumptions and scenario settings”), representing different waste utilization levels, to compare the biofuel production potentials with food transportation fossil fuel demands across countries.

For emission reduction analysis, a life cycle approach is adopted using the GREET model to evaluate the WTW emissions of biofuels and the fossil fuels they replace across different transport modes. Based on the fuel demand share for each transportation mode in different countries, the available biofuels under each scenario are proportionally allocated to each transportation mode. This allowed for an assessment of the emission reduction potential achievable by each country under varying food transportation structures.

Fossil fuel demand of food transportation

This study categorizes transportation into four distinct modes: road transportation, railway & inland waterway transportation, marine transportation, and aviation transportation, incorporating the demand for conventional fossil fuels including oil and natural gas. The fossil fuel demand of food transportation in each country can be expressed as:

$$\begin{array}{c}E{D}_{i}=({\sum }_{j}E{D}_{O,i}\times {T}_{j,i}+E{D}_{N,i})\times {F}_{i}\end{array}$$

(1)

Equation (1) represents the total food transportation fuel demand in each country by adding up the demand for various types of fuels under different transportation modes, which is used for comparative analysis with the biofuel production potential. EDi represents the fossil fuel demand (PJ) of food transportation in country i. EDO,i and EDN,i denote the demand for oil fuel and natural gas fuel, respectively. The study assumes that all natural gas fuel demand originates from road transportation57,58, with the proportion for oil fuel demand estimated according to regional consumption patterns of various fuel types globally48. Tj,i represents the proportion of oil fuel demand in transportation mode j (road, railway & inland waterway, marine, aviation). Fi denotes the proportion of food transportation relative to total transportation (Table S1), calculated based on the ratio of the transportation sector’s output allocated to the global food sector to the gross output of the transportation sector in each country, derived from the EORA26 MRIO table59,60.

Energy potential of food system waste

In this study, the CRs from 34 kinds of crop species and the UCO from 13 kinds of edible oils are considered (Table S2). The energy potentials of CRs and UCO in various countries are calculated according to crop production and consumption of edible oil, combined with waste collection coefficients and energy conversion coefficients (Table S3, Table S4).

Equation (2) calculates the total amount of CRs that can be collected in various countries based on yield coefficients and collection coefficients of CRs. On this basis, Eq. (3) calculates the energy potential of CRs by adding the energy conversion coefficients of various CRs types, which is used to calculate the production potentials of CRs-derived biofuels in various scenarios. \({C}_{{CRs},i}\) and \({{ENE}}_{{CRs},i}\) respectively represent the collectable amount (t) and theoretical energy potential (PJ) of CRs. \({Y}_{i,c}\) is the yield (t) of crop species c. \({S}_{F,c}\) and \({S}_{P,c}\) are the yield coefficients of field residues and processing residues per unit dry weight of crops, respectively (t t-1). \({\lambda }_{c}\) represents the collection coefficient61,62. \({p}_{{CRs},c}\) represents the energy conversion coefficient per unit dry weight of CRs (PJ t-1)29.

Equation (4) calculates the total amount of UCO that can be collected in various countries using the UCO collection coefficient based on the production, import, and export of various vegetable edible oil. Equation (5) calculates the energy potential of UCO, which is used to calculate the production potentials of UCO-derived biofuels in various scenarios. \({C}_{{UCO},i}\) and \({{ENE}}_{{UCO},i}\) respectively represent the collectable amount (t) and theoretical energy potential (PJ) of UCO. \({P}_{i,u}\), \({{IO}}_{i,u}\), and \({{EO}}_{i,u}\) are the production, import, and export amounts (t) of edible oil type u. \({\lambda }_{i}\) represents the collection coefficient of UCO, estimated based on the consumption and collection data of UCO in each country63. \({p}_{{UCO}}\) is the lower heating value of UCO (PJ t-1).

Life cycle analysis of biofuels and fossil fuels

This study compares life cycle emissions between conventional fossil fuels and representative biofuels across multiple transportation modes through defined substitution pathways: (1) Second-generation renewable biodiesel (RD II) displaces low-sulfur diesel in road transportation and conventional diesel in railway & inland waterway64,65; (2) the second-generation marine renewable biodiesel (RD II marine) substitutes heavy fuel oil in marine transport55,66; (3) the biomass Fischer-Tropsch aviation fuel (FT-AF) and HEFA sustainable aviation fuel (HEFA-SAF) replace conventional aviation fuel54,67; (4) the biomass liquefied natural gas (bio-LNG) supplants fossil-based liquefied natural gas (LNG) in road transport68. Figure 8 illustrates the WTW system boundaries encompassing biofuel production, distribution, and end-use combustion. The analysis evaluates emissions across all stages, including feedstock collection, conversion processes, transportation logistics, and final energy utilization.

This study evaluates biofuel production pathways through distinct biofuel conversion technologies. Fast pyrolysis converts CRs into RD II, while esterification-hydrogenation processes UCO into RD-II. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) methods produce FT-AF and HEFA-SAF from CRs and UCO, respectively. Anaerobic digestion processes both feedstocks into bio-LNG69,70,71,72. The analysis employs Argonne National Laboratory’s GREET model to quantify fuel production efficiencies and emission intensities across full lifecycle boundaries: well-to-wheel (WTW) for road/rail fuels, well-to-haul (WTH) for marine fuels, and well-to-wake (WTWa) for aviation fuels. The model calculation results of biofuel conversion efficiencies and emissions from biofuels/fossil fuels as shown in Table S5, Fig. S1. As only two energy sources (oil fuel and natural gas fuel) suitable to be substituted by biofuels are included in the emission analysis, the estimated overall emissions from food transportation in this study may be conservative. Detailed emission accounting methodologies and system boundaries of biofuels and fossil fuels are provided in Supplementary Information (Supplementary Methods Section 5).

Assumptions and scenario settings

To analyze the energy and emission reduction contributions of reusing food system wastes in food transportation under varying utilization levels, this study defines four scenarios of food system waste utilization: Scenario of sole UCO utilization, Scenario of sole CRs utilization, Scenario of UCO and CRs co-utilization, and Scenario of maximum biofuel production potential. The assumptions for each scenario are as follows:

Scenario of sole UCO utilization: Given that biofuel production from UCO has been already widely applied and UCO has a large presence in international markets, with biofuel production being its primary end use, this scenario assumes that all available UCO is converted into biofuels and reused within food transportation. The purpose is to assess the sole contribution of UCO reuse to food system.

Scenario of sole CRs utilization: While biofuel production from CRs is less common compared to UCO due to higher feedstock transport costs and broader competition from other uses, CRs generally have a higher yield potential. In this scenario, based on the IEA statistics on the proportion of global bioenergy used in the transport sector73,74, it is assumed that only 7% of CRs are utilized for biofuel production and reused in food transportation. This reflects the potential contribution of CRs to the food system under competing use constraints.

Scenario of UCO and CRs co-utilization: Considering that UCO-derived biofuels are more mature and typically have fewer competing applications, this scenario assumes that UCO-derived biofuels are used first to substitute fossil fuels. Any remaining fuel demand is supplemented by CRs-derived biofuels. To reflect the competition for CRs in other applications, their availability remains capped at 7%.

Scenario of maximum biofuel production potential: This scenario adopts the same utilization pathways as the co-utilization scenario but removes the 7% cap on CRs utilization. It represents the ideal case where food system wastes are fully leveraged to realize their maximum potential for fuel substitution and emission reduction in food transportation.

In addition to these scenario settings, this study assumes that, under each scenario, the biofuels derived from UCO and CRs are allocated to each transportation mode in proportion to the country-specific fossil fuel demand shares across transportation modes. This approach reflects the benefits of biofuel penetration into all food transportation modes while maintaining the current national food transportation structures.

Calculations of emission reductions

Calculations of biofuel production and emission reductions for each scenario proceed as follows:

(1)

Scenario of sole UCO utilization

Under the scenario of sole UCO utilization, it is assumed that all UCO in various countries is used for biofuel production. The total production of UCO-derived biofuels under sole UCO utilization (\({{ENE}}_{1,i}\)) (PJ) is calculated as:

$$\begin{array}{c}EN{E}_{1,i}=min \left(EN{E}_{UCO,i}^{{\prime}},E{D}_{i}\right)\end{array}$$

(6)

$$\begin{array}{c}EN{E}_{UCO,i}^{\prime}=EN{E}_{UCO,i}\times {\rho }_{UCO,i}\end{array}$$

(7)

$$\begin{array}{c}{\rho }_{UCO,i}=\left[{\sum }_{j}\left({T}_{j,i}\times {\rho }_{UCO,O,j}\right)\times E{D}_{O,i}+{\rho }_{UCO,N}\times E{D}_{N,i}\right]/E{D}_{i}\end{array}$$

(8)

Equation (8) calculates the conversion efficiency of UCO to biofuels by countries, which is used to convert the energy potential of UCO into biofuel production potential. Equations (6) and (7) respectively represent the maximum production potential and the utilization of UCO-derived biofuels under this scenario. The emission reduction contributed by UCO-derived biofuels (\({{ER}}_{1,i}\)) as substitutes for fossil fuels in food transportation is calculated as:

$$E{R}_{1,i}={\sum }_{f,j}\left[{T}_{f,j,i}\times \left({E}_{con,f,j}-{E}_{UCO,f,j}\right)\right]\times EN{E}_{1,i}$$

(9)

Equation (9) allocates the biofuel production potential s under this scenario according to the food transportation fuel demand shares, and calculates the emission reductions in various countries under this scenario by combining the difference between fossil fuel and biofuel emissions per unit under each transportation mode. \({{ENE}}_{{UCO},i}^{{\prime} }\) is the maximum biofuel production for UCO (PJ). \({\rho }_{{UCO},i}\) is the average conversion efficiency of UCO-derived biofuels. \({\rho }_{{UCO},O,j}\) and \({\rho }_{{UCO},N}\) are the UCO-derived biofuel conversion efficiencies for oil fuel and natural gas fuel, respectively. \({E}_{{con},f,j}\) is the life cycle emission (kg PJ-1) for conventional fuels of type f (oil fuel or natural gas fuel). \({E}_{{UCO},f,j}\) is the life cycle emission (kg PJ-1) for UCO-derived biofuels of type f under unit energy consumption.

(2)

Scenario of sole CRs utilization

To approximate realistic CRs availability for biofuel production, under this scenario, this study refers to the statistics of world’s bioenergy available for transportation fuel supply obtained from IEA73 and IRENA74, assuming available CRs for biofuel production not to exceed 7% of CRs’ total energy potential.

The total production of CRs-derived biofuels under sole CRs utilization (\({{ENE}}_{2,i}\)) (PJ) is calculated as:

$$EN{E}_{2,i}=min \left(\gamma \times EN{E}_{CRs,i}^{\prime},E{D}_{i}\right)$$

(10)

$$EN{E}_{CRs,i}^{\prime}=EN{E}_{CRs,i}\times {\rho }_{CRs,i}$$

(11)

$${\rho }_{CRs,i}=\left[{\sum }_{j}\left({T}_{j,i}\times {\rho }_{CRs,O,j}\right)\times E{D}_{O,i}+{\rho }_{CRs,N}\times E{D}_{N,i}\right]/E{D}_{i}$$

(12)

Equation (12) calculates the conversion efficiency of CRs to biofuels by countries, which is used to convert the energy potential of CRs into biofuel production potential. Equations (10) and (11) respectively represent the maximum production potential and the utilization of CRs-derived biofuels under this scenario. The emission reduction contributed by CRs-derived biofuels (\({{ER}}_{2,i}\)) as substitutions for fossil fuels in food transportation is calculated as:

$$E{R}_{2,i}={\sum }_{f,j}[{T}_{f,j,i}\times ({E}_{con,f,j}-{E}_{CRs,f,j})]\times EN{E}_{2,i}$$

(13)

Equation (13) conforms to the principle of Eq. (9). \({{ENE}}_{{CRs},i}^{{\prime} }\) is the maximum biofuel production for CRs (PJ). \(\gamma\) is the proportion of CRs that can be used to produce biofuels in the total (assumed as 7%). \({\rho }_{{CRs},i}\) is the average conversion efficiency of CRs-derived biofuel. \({\rho }_{{CRs},O,j}\) and \({\rho }_{{CRs},N}\) are the CRs-derived biofuel conversion efficiencies for oil fuel and natural gas fuel, respectively. \({E}_{{CRs},f,j}\) is the life cycle emission for CRs-derived biofuels of type f under unit energy consumption.

(3)

Scenario of UCO and CRs co-utilization.

The total production of food system wastes-derived biofuels under UCO and CRs co-utilization (\({{ENE}}_{3,i}\)) is calculated as:

$$EN{E}_{3,i}=min\,(EN{E}_{UCO,i}^{\prime}+\gamma \times EN{E}_{CRs,i}^{\prime},E{D}_{i})$$

(14)

$$EN{E}_{3,CRs,i}=EN{E}_{3,i}-EN{E}_{1,i}$$

(15)

Equations (14) and (15) respectively represent the total utilization of biofuels and the utilization of CRs-derived biofuels in this scenario. The emission reduction contributed jointly by UCO- and CRs-derived biofuels (\({{ER}}_{3,i}\)) is calculated by Eqs. (16)–(18):

$$E{R}_{3,i}=E{R}_{3,UCO,i}+E{R}_{3,CRS,i}$$

(16)

$$E{R}_{3,UCO,i}={\sum }_{f,j}[{T}_{f,j,i}\times ({E}_{con,fj}-{E}_{UCO,f,j})]\times EN{E}_{1,i}$$

(17)

$$E{R}_{3,CRS,i}={\sum }_{f,j}[{T}_{f,j,i}\times ({E}_{con,fj}-{E}_{CRs,f,j})]\times EN{E}_{3,CRs,i}$$

(18)

where, \({{ENE}}_{3,{CRs},i}\) is the production (PJ) of CRs-derived biofuels under this scenario. \({{ER}}_{3,{UCO},i}\) and \({{ER}}_{3,{CRS},i}\) are the emission reductions (t CO2) for UCO- and CRs-derived biofuels, respectively.

(4)

Scenario of maximum biofuel production potential

The total production of food system wastes-derived biofuels under UCO and CRs co-utilization without considering CRs’ competing uses (\({{ENE}}_{4,i}\)) is calculated as:

$$EN{E}_{4,i}=min(EN{E}_{UCO,i}^{\prime}+EN{E}_{CRs,i}^{\prime},E{D}_{i})$$

(19)

$$EN{E}_{4,CRs,i}=EN{E}_{4,i}-EN{E}_{1,i}$$

(20)

Equations (19) and (20) respectively represent the total utilization of biofuels and the utilization of CRs-derived biofuels in this scenario. The emission reduction contributed jointly by UCO- and CRs-derived biofuels (\({{ER}}_{4,i}\)) is calculated by Eqs. (21)-(23):

$$E{R}_{4,i}=E{R}_{4,UCO,i}+E{R}_{4,CRS,i}$$

(21)

$$E{R}_{4,UCO,i}={\sum }_{f,j}[{T}_{f,j}\times ({E}_{con,f,j}-{E}_{UCO,f,j})]\times EN{E}_{1,i}$$

(22)

$$E{R}_{4,CRS,i}={\sum }_{f,j}[{T}_{f,j}\times ({E}_{con,f,j}-{E}_{CRs,f,j})]\times EN{E}_{4,CRs,i}$$

(23)

where, \({{ENE}}_{4,{CRs},i}\) is the production (PJ) of CRs-derived biofuels under this scenario. \({{ER}}_{4,{UCO},i}\) and \({{ER}}_{4,{CRS},i}\) are the emission reductions (t CO2) of UCO- and CRs-derived biofuels, respectively.

“This platinum demand growth will be incremental overall, mitigating the expected decrease in petroleum platinum demand as global markets continue to make their energy transition from 2030 to 2050,” the council explains.
In the FT SAF production pathway, solid materials such as biomass are first converted into synthetic gas (syngas).
This makes it a strong candidate for commercial-scale SAF production, although supportive policies and regulatory frameworks are needed to accelerate its deployment.
However, cobalt catalysts are preferred in PtL FT and these use platinum as a promoter.","Platinum is required across all major sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production pathways, including power-to liquid (PtL), which uses the Fischer Tropsch process (FT), as well as the FT process itself, and while current platinum demand from SAF is modest, it is expected to grow significantly in the long term, industry body the World Platinum Investment Council points out.

The council expects yearly SAF capacity additions to increase eight-fold from about two-million tonnes in 2024 to about 16-million tonnes by 2050, while platinum demand from SAF production is expected to increase from negligible volumes to about 260 00 oz/y by 2050.

“This platinum demand growth will be incremental overall, mitigating the expected decrease in petroleum platinum demand as global markets continue to make their energy transition from 2030 to 2050,” the council explains.

The International Air Transport Association estimates that SAF could contribute about 65% of the reduction in emissions needed by aviation to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

Unlike petroleum-based kerosene, SAF is produced from sustainable, non-petroleum feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues and municipal solid waste, or via synthetic e-fuels combining renewable electricity with captured CO₂, the council explains.

Originally developed by German chemists Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch, this year marks 100 years since the FT process was developed.

Their research demonstrated that a mixture of the gases carbon monoxide and hydrogen could be transformed over suitable catalysts into liquid and solid hydrocarbons. Today, FT is used in myriad industrial applications, the council outlines.

PtL is a synthetic jet fuel produced using renewable electricity, with water and CO₂ serving as the primary inputs.

To create a climate-neutral carbon feedstock, green hydrogen and captured CO₂ (from the atmosphere or industrial sources) are used.

These components are then combined through FT synthesis to form liquid hydrocarbons, which are subsequently refined into a kerosene-equivalent fuel, the council adds.

In the FT SAF production pathway, solid materials such as biomass are first converted into synthetic gas (syngas). This syngas is then processed through FT synthesis into liquid wax. FT has significant scalability potential for SAF production as it can use a range of feedstocks, including waste materials that would otherwise be discarded.

This makes it a strong candidate for commercial-scale SAF production, although supportive policies and regulatory frameworks are needed to accelerate its deployment.

PLATINUM’S ROLE

The council highlights that platinum plays an important supporting role in certain types of FT synthesis. Iron catalysts dominate biomass FT and do not use platinum.

However, cobalt catalysts are preferred in PtL FT and these use platinum as a promoter. Even at very low concentrations, platinum improves cobalt catalyst reduction, stability and dispersion, resulting in higher efficiency and longer lifetimes, the council posits.

It adds that platinum has a significant role in isomerisation, which is needed in both the FT and the PtL FT SAF production pathways, where it functions as a catalyst to transform straight-chain hydrocarbons into branched isomers with better cold-flow properties.

“Without this step, SAF would fail to meet the strict freezing point requirements necessary for safe, high-altitude flight,” the council avers.",https://cdn.creamermedia.com/assets/articles/images/resized/0001240307_resized_rollsroyceflyingtestbedsafflightaviation11231022.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 08:56:44.301152

Abu Dhabi has unveiled a powerful vision that turns rubbish into renewable jet fuel. Through a partnership between clean energy pioneer Masdar and circular economy expert Tadweer Group, a new plant will process about half a million tonnes of municipal and biomass waste every year. The output will be sustainable aviation fuel that can cut life cycle emissions by as much as eighty per cent compared with traditional kerosene. The project will serve airlines across the region and propel the emirate to the forefront of next generation aviation.

How the technology converts trash into thrust

The planned facility unites two mature technologies in one production line. First, waste gasification transforms sorted refuse into a synthesis gas rich in carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Second, renewable powered electrolysers create additional green hydrogen from water. By blending both streams the plant achieves an optimal chemical balance that is then upgraded into sustainable jet fuel using established Fischer Tropsch chemistry. Because all electricity for electrolysis comes from solar and other clean sources, the end product retains a very low carbon intensity.

Insight: why waste matters more than feedstock price

An often overlooked benefit of waste based fuel is feedstock stability. Unlike crop oils, municipal waste volumes remain steady regardless of commodity cycles, giving producers predictable supply and shielding airlines from volatility. That stability can drive longer fuel offtake contracts and lower financing costs for future facilities.

Conclusion

The waste to fuel initiative demonstrates how circular economy thinking can unlock climate progress while supporting a sector that already contributes significantly to the national economy. By treating refuse as a valuable resource Abu Dhabi is setting a regional benchmark for integrated waste management, clean hydrogen and low carbon mobility.

The two companies will evaluate opportunities to integrate SAF from the UAE’s first commercial‑scale SAF plant, being developed by MENA Biofuels in the Fujairah Oil Industry Zone. The USD 300 million facility will convert used cooking oil and other waste-based feedstocks into certified SAF. The plant is expected to produce 125 million litres annually in its first phase, increasing to 250 million litres per year in phase two. According to the company, the output could supply up to 36% of the UAE’s 2030 SAF target.

ENOC Acting Chief Executive Hussain Sultan Lootah said developing SAF requires the full value chain to scale together and noted the company’s intention to make the fuel commercially viable. MENA Biofuels Chairman Mohamed Saeed Al Raqbani said the collaboration will support the expansion of domestic production and help implement the UAE’s SAF Roadmap 2030. Chief Executive Gati Al-Jebouri added that the partnership will help establish the UAE as a regional centre for sustainable aviation fuel. The cooperation aims to build a fully localised SAF supply chain and enhance regional access to low‑carbon aviation fuel. The companies say joint efforts will support the aviation industry’s decarbonisation goals and increase the UAE’s capacity to supply SAF domestically and internationally.",https://www.fuelsandlubes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cropped-icon-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-21 10:57:36.565704

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is quickly becoming a key factor in reducing the environmental impact of flying. With the introduction of advanced electrolytic SAF (eSAF), travelers now need to understand how these fuels affect flight options, ticket prices, and overall travel planning.

SAF offers a greener alternative to traditional jet fuel, but its higher cost and limited availability can influence airline operations. For those planning trips in 2025 and beyond, understanding SAF is essential for making informed travel choices.

What Travelers Need to Know About eSAF

eSAF, a synthetic form of SAF, is produced using renewable energy and captured carbon. It significantly reduces carbon emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. According to recent industry analyses, eSAF currently costs more than 13 times traditional jet fuel and about 3.5 times more than conventional bio-SAF options.

For travelers, this means that eco-friendly flights may carry slightly higher ticket prices, especially on routes where SAF mandates are being actively enforced. Airlines incorporating eSAF are investing in sustainability, but the cost gap between conventional fuel and SAF is still significant.

SAF Mandates in Europe and the UK

Travelers flying to or within Europe should be aware of upcoming SAF requirements:

European Union: SAF blending in aviation fuel starts at 2% in 2025, increasing to 6% by 2030 and 20% by 2035. By 2050, the target is 70%. eSAF, a more advanced synthetic option, will be required starting in 2030 and gradually increase to 35% by 2050.

United Kingdom: SAF usage starts at 2% in 2025, increasing to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040. The UK also has a sub-target for synthetic SAF reaching 3.5% by 2040.

These mandates aim to make flights greener while supporting the aviation industry’s net-zero carbon goals. For travelers, this highlights the growing availability of more sustainable flights across Europe.

Airlines and the Current SAF Challenge

While SAF adoption is increasing, supply remains limited. Many airlines are concerned about meeting these mandates due to the high cost and restricted availability of eSAF. Some airline executives have noted that targets, such as a 10% SAF blend in the UK by 2030, may be ambitious without additional government support.

For travelers, this means that eco-conscious flight options may currently be limited, especially on shorter or less busy routes. However, popular international airports in Europe are more likely to have flights blending SAF, offering travelers a chance to reduce their environmental impact.

Tips for Travelers Seeking Green Flights

Travelers who want to fly sustainably can take several practical steps:

Check airline sustainability reports: Many airlines disclose the percentage of SAF used on their flights. Choosing these airlines helps support greener aviation.

Book flights early: As SAF adoption increases, flights with higher SAF blends may become premium or limited offerings.

Prioritize major airports: Large hubs like Amsterdam, London, and Frankfurt are leading SAF adoption, offering more eco-friendly flight options.

Understand pricing: Be aware that eco-friendly flights may cost more initially due to the high price of eSAF, though governments may provide incentives in some regions.

These small steps allow travelers to actively contribute to reducing aviation emissions while planning responsible trips.

Looking Ahead: The Future of Green Air Travel

While eSAF remains expensive, it is currently the most practical solution for reducing flight emissions without overhauling existing aircraft. Other technologies, like hydrogen or electric planes, are still years away from commercial viability.

For global travelers, this means that SAF will play an increasingly important role in making flights more environmentally friendly. Early adoption of SAF-friendly airlines allows travelers to minimize their carbon footprint and encourages airlines to continue investing in green aviation solutions.

Conclusion: Travel Smarter, Fly Greener

Sustainable aviation fuels are shaping the future of air travel. Understanding SAF, eSAF costs, and airline adoption helps travelers make informed choices. While ticket prices may reflect current fuel costs, flying with SAF ensures a smaller environmental impact.

As SAF becomes more mainstream, travelers will see more eco-conscious flight options, making green air travel accessible and practical for global tourism.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) prices are rising sharply, particularly electrolytic SAF (eSAF), which now costs significantly more than conventional jet fuel. Understanding these trends can help travelers make eco-conscious decisions while planning trips.

Why SAF Is Becoming Important

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a key solution for reducing aviation emissions without altering aircraft or airport systems. Unlike electric or hydrogen planes, which are still in early stages, SAF can be used immediately on existing flights.

Europe and the UK are implementing SAF mandates, requiring airlines to blend increasing amounts of sustainable fuel into their flights. By 2025, Europe expects a 2% SAF share in aviation fuel, rising to 6% by 2030 and 20% by 2035. The UK has similar targets, starting with a 2% blend in 2025 and reaching 10% by 2030.

For travelers, this shift means more flights will include SAF, sometimes at slightly higher ticket prices. But these changes are crucial for supporting sustainable air travel.

Current SAF Prices and Travel Impact

Reports indicate that eSAF costs nearly 13 times more than traditional jet fuel in key European hubs like Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Antwerp. Even compared to bio-SAF, eSAF is more than three times as expensive.

For travelers, higher SAF costs can translate into modestly higher flight fares. Yet, choosing airlines that prioritize SAF use supports cleaner air travel. It also aligns with a growing trend of responsible tourism, where travelers consider environmental impact when selecting flights.

Airlines’ Approach to SAF

Not all airlines are equally prepared for the SAF transition. Some carriers express concerns about supply shortages and meeting mandated targets. However, international aviation bodies highlight government support as a key factor in stabilizing SAF supply and costs.

Travelers can take advantage of this by researching airlines’ sustainability initiatives. Many carriers now disclose SAF usage percentages, helping passengers make eco-conscious choices.

Tips for Eco-Friendly Travel

Check Airline SAF Policies: Select carriers that actively use SAF to reduce carbon footprints.

Book in Advance: Early bookings can offset rising ticket prices linked to higher fuel costs.

Fly Through Key Hubs: Major European airports, such as Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Antwerp, are leading SAF adoption.

Plan for Sustainability: Consider flights that blend SAF use with other eco-friendly travel practices.

These small choices allow travelers to enjoy their trips responsibly while supporting sustainable aviation efforts.

Travel Planning Amid Fuel Price Changes

As SAF production increases, travelers may see gradual stabilization in ticket pricing. Experts predict a temporary oversupply until around 2030, followed by stricter mandates. This could influence fares and airline compliance penalties.

Being aware of these trends helps travelers anticipate costs and make smarter decisions. For example, flights with a higher SAF blend may be slightly more expensive but are environmentally responsible. Travelers who prioritize sustainability contribute to the aviation industry’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The Future of Sustainable Air Travel

SAF is reshaping the way we think about flying. While costs remain higher than conventional fuel, the benefits to the environment are significant. Travelers can play a role by choosing airlines that commit to SAF and planning trips with sustainability in mind.

The rise of SAF also signals a shift in global travel culture. Eco-conscious travelers are increasingly considering their carbon footprint, and airlines are responding by integrating greener practices. From long-haul flights to regional connections, SAF adoption is becoming a defining feature of modern travel.

Conclusion: Flying Responsibly

For global travelers, understanding the implications of SAF prices is essential. By choosing airlines that prioritize sustainable fuel, planning travel strategically, and supporting eco-friendly practices, passengers can enjoy flights that are both enjoyable and responsible.

This RCM will act as a financial support system to help encourage domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The Bill works alongside the existing SAF Mandate, which already requires fuel suppliers to include increasing amounts of SAF into the UK aviation fuel mix. While the Mandate creates demand, the Bill addresses the supply side by making it financially viable for companies to invest in building SAF production plants in the UK.

Probably by the end of 2026.

The Bill has completed its committee stage in the Commons and was welcomed by Members across the House as a necessary step towards decarbonising aviation.

It had a second reading yesterday (20 November), with the government intending for all required legislation to be in place by the end of 2026.

In the meantime, the supporting SAF Mandate, or, to give it its official name, the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) Order 2024, came into force at the beginning of 2025.

The Mandate requires fuel suppliers to ensure that 2% of UK jet fuel comes from sustainable sources, rising to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040. Unless this is going to be imported, domestic production needs to be encouraged, hence the SAF Bill.

The UK is far from alone in mandating sustainable aviation fuel, though approaches vary significantly worldwide.

The EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates SAF share beginning at 2% in 2025, increasing incrementally to 70% by 2050. This is considerably more ambitious than the UK’s 22% target by 2040.

However, the EU scheme does not permit a buy-out mechanism – airlines face penalties but must still make up for non-compliance in the following year. The practical impact is already being felt. Airlines operating in Europe face an additional US$1.3 billion (approx. £995 million) during 2025 in compliance fees, with charges often being twice the prevailing market price premium of SAF.

Singapore is implementing a direct passenger levy from October 2026. Charges ranging from S$1 (approximately £0.58) for economy passengers flying within Southeast Asia to S$41.60 (around £32) for business and first class passengers heading to the Americas. Singapore aims for SAF to make up 1% of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, rising to 3-5% by 2030.

Notably, transit passengers through Singapore are exempt from the levy – a pragmatic decision to maintain the city-state’s position as a major hub, though one that’s drawn criticism for appearing to make residents subsidise international travellers.

The US approach focuses on tax credits rather than mandates, with the section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit providing up to US$1.75 (£1.34) per gallon for SAF that meets emissions reduction thresholds.

The Biden Administration had targeted 3 billion gallons of SAF production by 2030, though Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ reduced tax credits and will significantly impact the feasibility of that target.

The UK’s approach sits somewhere between the EU’s stricter mandates and the US’s incentive-based system. By combining a mandate (creating guaranteed demand) with the RCM (supporting supply), we are aiming to build a domestic SAF industry while capping consumer costs – though whether this balancing act succeeds remains to be seen.

Yes, in theory. Industry body IATA estimates that SAF could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions needed by aviation to reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. This makes SAF the single most important tool for aviation decarbonisation in the near to medium term.

However, context is crucial. The UK’s 22% SAF target by 2040 means that 78% of fuel will still be conventional kerosene. Even with SAF delivering 70-85% lifecycle emissions reductions, this translates to roughly a 15-19% reduction in overall UK aviation emissions by 2040.

There are, however, serious questions about SAF’s sustainability credentials, depending on how it’s made. To find out more about that, check out our SAF explainer.

The success of the scheme ultimately depends on whether it successfully catalyses a domestic SAF industry capable of meeting the mandated volumes. If suppliers consistently opt to pay buy-out fees rather than source SAF, then it won’t work.

The government’s £400 million investment through the Advanced Fuels Fund is welcome, but whether this proves sufficient to overcome the current cost and supply barriers remains uncertain.

From a business traveller’s perspective, the SAF Bill represents an attempt to make flying marginally greener without drastically increasing costs, though it’s noticeable that Air Passenger Duty (APD), which is far higher and will rise again in April 2026 goes directly to the Treasury, and hasn’t been used for environmental causes.

Whether the new UK SAF Levy succeeds in balancing these competing priorities – and whether its ambitions prove sufficient to meaningfully address aviation’s climate impact – will only become clear over the coming decade.

As we have heard today, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill aims to encourage investment in sustainable aviation fuel in the UK by creating a mechanism to guarantee a certain level of revenue.
We will, as we go through this Bill, have regard to its overall effect on the provision of sustainable aviation fuel.","The Minister of State, Department for Transport (Lord Hendy of Richmond Hill) (Lab) - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My Lords, I am pleased to present the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill for Second Reading today. I welcome the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester and congratulate him on his forthcoming maiden speech in your Lordships’ House today. I look forward to hearing his contribution to this important debate, and to his many contributions in the months and years ahead.

If we are to be an outward, confident trading nation that is connected to the world and leading the way on innovation, we must move as fast as we can towards a greener, cleaner future for flying. Domestic transport accounted for 29% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2023. Aviation is currently the second largest contributor, and it faces unique barriers to decarbonisation. By 2040 it is set to overtake road vehicle use as transport’s largest emitter. SAF will be key to decarbonisation, a drop-in solution that can be used today in today’s aircraft with today’s infrastructure. SAF also has huge economic benefits for the wider low-carbon fuels industry, potentially supporting up to 15,000 jobs and contributing up to £5 billion to the economy by 2050.

SAF is not the only measure that we are supporting to address emissions in the aviation sector. The Government are supporting the development of more efficient and zero-emission aircraft technologies, and we have announced a further £1 billion of funding for the Aerospace Technology Institute to help to spur green aerospace innovation. The Civil Aviation Authority, supported by my department’s funding, is shaping regulations for zero-emission aircraft through its hydrogen challenge. Alongside that, we are advancing airspace modernisation to enable cleaner, quicker and quieter journeys. The Government are also establishing a UK airspace design service with the Civil Aviation Authority and the National Air Traffic Service, which are working together to launch this by the end of the year.

Turning to aviation fuel, the Government, alongside industry, are working collaboratively to ramp up the UK’s SAF industry. The UK stands at the forefront of global efforts to decarbonise aviation. When this Government came into power, we acted immediately by laying the statutory instrument for the SAF mandate, which came into force on 1 January this year. We have invested £63 million in 17 projects through the Advanced Fuels Fund, which will drive growth, support good jobs and deliver emissions reduction.

The revenue certainty mechanism introduced in the Bill is a scheme designed to support UK SAF production to drive growth and opportunity across the country. It addresses the lack of a clear and predictable market price for SAF, one of the biggest constraints on investment in UK SAF production. The RCM builds on the established precedent of contracts for difference in the renewables sector. Under the RCM, an SAF producer will enter into a private law contract with a government-owned counterparty that sets a guaranteed strike price for SAF. If SAF is sold for under that price, the counterparty will pay the difference to the producer. If SAF is sold above the price, the producer will pay the difference to the counterparty.

It is important to emphasise that no final decisions have been taken on how the strike price will be determined. The RCM contracts must set a strike price that finds a balance between securing the appropriate protection for the producer and its investors and providing value for money for the scheme and the wider sector. This is a new and emerging market. This will be the world’s first SAF RCM, and it will derisk SAF projects by addressing barriers to investment in a nascent market that is using innovative technologies. Like similar schemes in the low-carbon electricity sector, this will help to provide greater certainty of future revenue, help to attract investment in first-of-a-kind SAF plants, and support growth and opportunity across the country.

Turning to the SAF Bill, it has four key areas. First, it will enable the Secretary of State to designate a counterparty that is wholly owned by government. Secondly, the Secretary of State can direct the counterparty to enter into private law contracts with SAF producers, guaranteeing a price for the sale of eligible SAF over a period of time. The mechanism is there to support the development of a first-of-a-kind plant by increasing investor confidence. While first-of-a-kind plants are likely to be more expensive than future plants, supporting them allows future, cheaper plants to get constructed and start producing SAF. The contract allocation process will be designed to maximise competition, with all contracts to be underpinned by robust technical and commercial due diligence to ensure that successful projects represent value for money.

Thirdly, the Bill will enable the Secretary of State to make regulations imposing a levy on suppliers of aviation fuel in the UK, in order to fund the RCM. That will allow the counterparty to collect the levy to cover the costs of issuing payments under contracts that are administering the scheme. It is right that the costs of decarbonising air travel should at least be partially borne by the aviation sector rather than the taxpayer. We are levying aviation fuel suppliers because placing the levy higher up the supply chain spreads costs across the sector, and because aviation fuel suppliers will benefit from the greater volumes and lower prices for SAF that the RCM will create. The RCM will provide support only if SAF is actually being produced. If a project fails, there is no obligation on the Government to provide support. While novel technologies can have high failure rates, we can support multiple technology pathways to minimise risk and strengthen the UK’s project pipeline.

Fourthly, the Bill will enable the Secretary of State to enforce certain provisions imposing financial penalties. The Secretary of State may impose a financial penalty on a person who fails to comply with levy regulations, or with requirements under regulations made to ensure that any paid-out surplus is used to benefit fuel suppliers’ customers.

This is a comprehensive and focused Bill that lays the foundations for a thriving UK SAF industry by delivering investment certainty, cutting emissions and securing the long-term sustainability of the aviation industry. More SAF supply and lower prices are good for the aviation sector and, ultimately, for those who wish to fly. The Bill is an essential part of securing our world-class aviation sector’s future, and we want it to do that sustainably. I look forward to engaging with noble Lords on this legislation. I beg to move.

Earl Russell (LD) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My Lords, we too look forward to the maiden speech of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester, and we welcome him to the House. We are generally supportive of the measures in the Bill but have some concerns about areas of government policy that lie beyond its scope, and a few questions about the details.

To put the Bill in its legitimate context, it will help reduce CO2 emissions from aviation, but it is not a magic bullet. Alone, it is not a sustainable answer to the challenges we face. Aviation is, of course, one of the hardest sectors to abate and it is expected to show continued and rapid upward growth. Aviation is critical to our economy and our way of life. It moves some 240 million international passengers and 2.4 million tonnes of freight each year, adding £14 billion in GVA to UK GDP. The industry also supports 1 million associated jobs and £4.2 billion in associated passenger duty. Aviation accounts for 7% of UK carbon emissions, but this figure is due to rise significantly, to 11% in 2030 and 16% in 2035. Unless decisive action is taken on a broad range of fronts beyond the scope of the Bill, we will not meet our targets. Net zero 2050 is not optional; it is imperative.

We on these Benches do not wish to challenge any UK family’s right to a holiday. When we debate the Bill, we need to be clear that 15% of people in this country take 70% of the flights, and we need to change that. The Climate Change Committee was clear in 2023 when it said that SAF alone is a risky strategy. My party would reform air passenger duty to target the most frequent flyers. We would ensure that we have an escalating passenger duty so that those who fly the most frequently, pay more. We also oppose overexpansion of the airports, particularly in the south-east. This Government have chosen to take a different path, and it is for them to balance this path of increased airport expansion against their climate change commitments and targets. Therefore, we welcome the Bill but note our caveats.

SAF is widely considered as the main available pathway to decarbonise aviation. It can cut lifecycle emissions by up to 70% compared with conventional jet fuel. As we have heard, it is a drop-in fuel that can be used alongside existing aircraft and infrastructure. The SAF mandate passed last year starts at 2% and rises to 10% by 2030, and then to 22% in 2040. From 2040, the obligation will remain at 22% unless there is greater certainty of supply. The SAF mandate could, it is claimed, deliver up to 6.3 megatons of carbon savings each year by 2040.

We on these Benches welcome the revenue certainty mechanism. It will serve to strengthen investor confidence and unlock significant capital investment in the production facilities that need to be based here in the UK. It will allow for long-term stability and contracts through the guaranteed strike price. As the Minister said, this mechanism has been widely used in the renewables sector, and we know that it works. It will provide certainty to these suppliers. The approach is logical. The industry stands to benefit from cheaper staff, and the cost will be spread widely throughout the industry.

We recognise the UK’s approach, the long-term mandate, the proposed revenue support and the degree of certainty it will provide to help with this transition. Indeed, the UK is seen as an example of best practice, with ambitious targets and support mechanisms. Establishing a homegrown low-carbon fuel sector will bring significant jobs and benefits to the UK industry and wider society. Will the Minister update the House on the progress of ongoing negotiations with industry, running parallel with the Bill? Further, when will the Government be able to provide details on how the strike price will be set and what mechanisms will exist for adjustments? When do the Government anticipate that the first contracts will be signed?

While we welcome the Bill, we stress that SAF is only a first step. This is about not merely blending fuels but seeking alternative, more sustainable climate-friendly options for the longer term. That needs continuous investment and innovation in the next generations of technologies, including the battery/electric and hydrogen-fuelled. The Bill sets the policy framework, but crucial details are left to subsequent negotiations.

We have several key questions regarding the Bill’s ambition, scope and technical design. The SAF mandate requires 22% of jet fuel to be sustainable by 2040. This means that 78% of fuels will still be polluting just a decade before our net-zero deadline, so how will the Government achieve this target? In addition, the European Union has a higher target of 70% by 2050. What action will the Government take to bring further alignment not just with our EU partners but internationally?

We also have concerns about SAF feedstocks and the amount of cooking oil that is imported. It is important that we have a reliable domestic supply. We also note concerns about bioethanol and the closure of plants, particularly the Vivergo plant in Hull, and the impact of the US trade deal and subsidies on US ethanol. We are concerned about the potential for future bioethanol plant closures.

What consideration have the Government given to the inclusion of intermediate cover crops, such as catch and cover, as a scalable feedstock outside the HEFA cap to expand the resource base without competing with food markets? We believe that the transition to a sustainable aviation industry must be strategically linked to our existing industrial base. What actions are the Government taking to see that existing industrial plants are brought back into use, make sure that the planning system is fit for purpose and ensure that these plants can be brought online quickly?

While the Government are committed to undertaking a comprehensive assessment of these industrial sites to see that they are brought back online, transparency is paramount given the importance of public trust and accountability. The funding levy should also not place undue financial burden on air travellers, so how will the Government review the impacts to ensure that the levy does not include further burdens on those travellers? For the sake of public accountability, are the Government amenable to ensuring that the airlines report publicly on their use of SAF and the amount of it that they supply? We broadly welcome this Bill, but the Bill alone is not a sustainable long-term solution, and we call for greater monetary transparency and openness.

Lord Ravensdale (CB) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My Lords, I declare my interests as a chief engineer working for AtkinsRéalis and co-chair of Legislators for Nuclear. I look forward to the maiden speech of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester. I support the Bill, with the caveat that costs to consumers of these measures must always be front and centre, with all the freedoms that cheap air travel has opened up to people from all backgrounds in recent decades. But I accept that there is a strategic need to invest in the long-term sustainability of aviation fuel for the UK and that we need a revenue certainty mechanism alongside the mandate.

I have three broad points. My first is around the definitions in the Bill of fuels that are eligible for the revenue certainty mechanism. Clause 16 defines “sustainable aviation fuel” as,

“aviation fuel that is renewable transport fuel”.

“Renewable transport fuel” is defined in the same clause as,

“anything that is (or is treated as) renewable transport fuel for the purposes of Chapter 5 of Part 2 of the Energy Act 2004”.

It then refers to Sections 131D and 132. I proposed the amendment to what is now the Energy Act 2023 that led to Section 131D, which treats recycled carbon fuels and nuclear-derived fuels as renewable transport fuels. That amendment was therefore a key enabler for this Bill in enabling support for second-generation and types of third-generation SAF.

However, this requires secondary legislation to take effect and treat these fuels as renewable transport fuels. This has not been completely done for the surface transport renewable transport fuel order; it has been done only for recycled carbon fuels. But it has been done for the sustainable aviation renewable transport fuel order, so we have quite a convoluted legislative route here between various Acts and secondary legislation. Can the Minister please confirm that recycled carbon fuels and nuclear-derived fuels are within the scope of the revenue certainty mechanism outlined in the Bill?

Clearly, recycled carbon fuels will be very important in the near term. Over the medium to long term, nuclear could well be a significant source of synthetic fuels due to the potential economic efficiency it brings to hydrogen production, whether that is high-temperature electrolysis, with the current pressurised water reactor plants, or, looking further ahead, the sulphur-iodine cycle in advanced high-temperature nuclear plant.

My second point is around the powers that the Government are taking in the Bill. They have clearly stated that they do not intend to offer contracts for first-generation SAF based on hydrogenated esters and fatty acids—HEFA. Should this therefore be stated in the Bill? The Government should take only the powers they need, given that this Bill is a framework for the long term. There is a case that the powers in the Bill should be limited to second-generation and third-generation sustainable aviation fuels. I do not foresee any good reason why HEFA fuels would need such support, so I believe that this could be clearly stated in the Bill.

My third point is around value for money and competition. We rightly heard a lot of discussion in the other place around costs to consumers and analysis on the £1.50 impacts on airfares. The Minister clearly stated that we need to get the right balance between investors and consumers with the prices that are negotiated, but another way of looking at this relates to the competitive structure within the Bill. Of course, the way the Bill is structured around bilateral negotiations, rather than a competitive process, is what is needed for the SAF market at this stage, noting its immaturity. An auction process, such as that which we have for offshore wind, is not perhaps appropriate at this stage.

However, this Bill needs to be fit for the longer term. Competition is the way to drive down costs for consumers in the long term, as has been demonstrated in more mature markets such as offshore wind. So, in the longer term, we need that mechanism for auctions and competitions within the Bill but, looking through it, I cannot see a mechanism for setting up such a competitive process.

Other government legislation, such as the Energy Act 2013 for CfDs for renewable energy generation, clearly states that regulations made may include provision for,

“the determination of a matter on a competitive basis”.

We also have that in the Energy Act 2023 for low-carbon hydrogen, which clearly states:

“Provision falling within subsection (2) may include provision for … the determination of a matter on a competitive basis”.

This Bill makes no provision for regulations to cover the determination of a matter on a competitive basis, or indeed for allocation frameworks. I would be grateful if the Minister could state whether, in his view, a competitive framework is covered by the Bill as written and, if not, whether it should be. The Bill should be fit for the future to avoid the need for future legislation in this area, and it should be structured to minimise costs to consumers, which in the end will be enabled through competition.

Finally, this Bill will go a long way to realising second-generation and third-generation SAF production in the UK, but the Government need urgently to address broader challenges as well, not least our high industrial electricity prices. I have spoken to a number of companies that want to set up SAF plants and related infrastructure in the UK, but they simply cannot make the numbers stack up when our electricity is four times as expensive as competitors such as the USA. This is a very energy-intensive industry. Alongside the measures in this Bill, we need to address the fundamentals to ensure that we are being fair to consumers and minimising required subsidies. I hope the Government will think about the broader framework as well and not just see this as a problem to be addressed through subsidies.

The Lord Bishop of Chester (Maiden Speech) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My Lords, I thank noble Lords for their warm welcome, although I confess that sustainable aviation fuel was not a subject that I imagined I would be addressing when various noble Lords have given me advice about maiden speeches. I am grateful for their wisdom, warmth and welcome, and especially that of the doorkeepers and staff of this House. It seems that I should have taken them rather more literally when they said I would be working with high-flyers, and rather less literally when they pointed out that not everything was rocket science.

I speak as one born almost two and a half thousand miles from where we sit. Indeed, the first serious journey of my life was by air, back here to the UK. I am also a father and, like the rest of this noble House, entrusted with passing on entire to the next generation this good earth. Sustainability matters: the good Lord provided us with many things, but a spare planet was not among them, at least in this age. It is this balance of pragmatisms which means that I speak largely in support of the Bill. We need to be real about air travel being vital to modern life. It builds community, enables encounter and crosses divides.

My diocese of Chester serves communities in two nations and 23 local authorities. It spans urban and rural, wealth and extreme poverty. We gaze at the universe from Jodrell Bank. We support half of the Mersey’s industrial life. We rejoice in our schools and in Chester University, and we cherish our world-renowned zoo. Indeed, we also have Warrington, which, according to the i Paper, may be Britain’s hardest-working town—who knew? All are part of the life of the diocese, from the newish migrant to the most established among the Cheshire set, from those who take penalties on the sporting field to those who serve a very different type of penalty. We are linked to the world both by Liverpool John Lennon Airport, which is in the diocese of Liverpool just across the River Mersey, and Manchester Airport, where one actually lands in the diocese of Chester but disembarks in the diocese of Manchester.

To repeat myself, the diocese of Chester touches two nations. I serve a border people, just as I did in my former see of Berwick-upon-Tweed. In Chester, we have several parishes which are all or partly in Wales. My Lords—or, as I should say, “fy Arglwyddi”—“Esgob Caer ydw i a ’dw i’n dysgu tipyn bach o Cymraeg”. I apologise for my lamentable Welsh accent. I am learning a little Welsh, partly because I carried on with Duolingo long after lockdown but, much more importantly, because communication is a vital gift for those of us who nurture and curate community. In communication, we need to learn to speak and to listen. This is almost always done in person and directly. Indeed, I argue that one of our primary vocations in this noble House is to be with and to listen, for few disciplines are more vital in the search for wisdom—the search I so often witness in your Lordships’ House. The question for me is not so much how we can be great again, but how we can be kindly present. Greatness is great, but grace is greater.

Air travel does more than build community; it enables partnership and commerce. It is a vital part of the defence of our nation, as I witnessed when offering chaplaincy to our Armed Forces. It is the backbone of much international aid provision, and it enables care for people and the planet. Chester Zoo, for example, serves ecosystems around this world. The relative ease of transport is one factor in this. My experience working in the university sector showed just how much journeys matter in the service of education.

Air travel is vital and is here to stay, but its environmental impact must be addressed. This means that net zero matters, but it is not the only sustainability consideration. Mike Berners-Lee points out, when ostensibly discussing the environmental impact of bananas, that the problem is not only emissions but where they are released. Sustainable fuel is far from carbon neutral. Although it shortens the life cycle of released carbon in the sense that it releases carbon which has only recently been captured, it also moves that carbon into the upper parts of the atmosphere, where it is most harmful.

I welcome the Bill’s creation of an economic framework in which SAF becomes a viable investment. I welcome the balancing of the use between investment by directing costs towards those who make use of the service—in effect, taxing flying to enable more sustainable flight seems very sensible. By itself, though, the Bill does not do nearly enough. The move it encourages from first- to second- and then, vitally, to third-generation SAF is essential. HyNet, in which the University of Chester is a partner, and which makes use of the geology and industrial infrastructure in the north-west, is one other expression of this kind of investment. The production of green hydrogen, which combines captured carbon with sustainably electrolysed hydrogen, really is the holy grail here—let any budding and noble theologians note that I do not use that term in a technical sense

Alongside the Bill, we must invest in rail and in environmental road transport if we are to progress to sustainability. It cannot be right that more than half my return trains from this place to my home in Chester seem to be delayed or cancelled. What are the projected timescales for substantive provision of third-generation SAF? Is consideration being given to roll out this technology beyond aviation?

The Bill helps us play our part in global well-being in every sense. The question with which I come to this House is—as I mentioned earlier—not so much how we make Britain great again, but rather how we make Britain kind again. Such kindness and responsibility are what leads to greatness in a manner which actually lasts and embraces all. In this, this Bill matters. Our infrastructure must line up with our fundamental identity and core vocation if we are to thrive. The Bill represents one structural step, but it is a step in the right direction and I support it.

Lord Grayling (Con) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My Lords, it is a particular pleasure to follow a very well-articulated tribute to the right reverend Prelate, to whom I also offer my congratulations on a very well-made, thoughtful and appropriate maiden speech. He will undoubtedly make a major contribution in this House, and I think all of us welcome him to this place.

I start, ironically, by referring to my entry in the register as an advisor to AtkinsRéalis as well as to Hutchison Ports. It is a particular pleasure for me to speak in this Second Reading debate. Two years ago, I was responsible for an amendment to the then Energy Bill which mandated the Government to set up a revenue support mechanism for sustainable aviation fuel in the UK. I stopped after getting 56 Conservative signatures to the amendment, which proved enough, just about, to finally jolt the Government, particularly the Treasury, into action and starting a process which has brought us to this point today. I am glad that I will be speaking alongside my noble friend Lord Harper, who followed that by playing a significant part in delivering us to the point we are at today. My noble friend is another example of why this is a genuinely bipartisan Bill. There are debates, differences and discussions about the detail, but there has been strong support across all sides for the principles that underlie the Bill today.

I was very pleased at the time that Ministers then recognised that they needed to do something and I am very pleased that Ministers in the current Government have continued the work that we started and have delivered this piece of legislation, which I strongly support, albeit with some caveats and questions which I want to push the Minister on today, in Committee and subsequently. I think there are some things that need to be tightened up and some questions that need to be answered, but the principle is absolutely right.

For me, the reason this all matters is very simple. The aviation industry is under growing pressure over its carbon footprint. Whether you are an opponent or a supporter of net zero is, to my mind, completely irrelevant to this debate. This is actually about the market pressures on the airlines themselves, particularly from a younger generation of potential customer among whom flight shaming has become more visible. The industry has to address those concerns, and we have to help it address those concerns and its impact on the environment.

It is not just about politics, it is actually about what is commercially necessary for what is one of our most important economic sectors. Of course, that is why Virgin Atlantic, Boeing and Rolls-Royce collaborated on the ground-breaking transatlantic pioneering flight using sustainable aviation fuel two years ago. We were on that flight and it was a very unique experience. It is why I know that most of the industry strongly supports this legislation. It is why the last Government brought forward plans for the SAF mandate and why this Government continued to introduce the mandate at the start of this year.

Why then do we need a revenue certainty mechanism of the kind set out in the Bill? Our airlines could just buy SAF from overseas. The initial product being used in this country will almost certainly come principally from the United States. There are two very good reasons why the Bill remains necessary. First, our aviation sector is, as I say, a key part of our economy; it is the strongest sector in Europe, it is fundamental to our regions and to the economy of so many different parts of the country. Do we really just want to import the fuel it needs for the future, or is it better to encourage serious investment here, of the kind that companies such as alfanar are planning for Teesside—a part of the country that clearly wants and needs investment?

Even in a world of free markets, sometimes I really think we need to make sure that we do some important things for ourselves. I think we can have a successful SAF sector in the UK that brings investment and creates jobs, but SAF plants require a very large amount of capital, and investors are always cautious about new markets and developing technologies. The truth is that the first SAF plants in the United States, of which there are just a handful, received investment support from the Biden Administration. The EU is poised to introduce its own revenue certainty mechanism. The Minister was right to say that ours is the first in the world, but it is not going to be the last, so for me it comes down to a straightforward choice: do we want a SAF industry in the UK or do we just have to depend on imports? I do not think we have to. My view is that we need that industry in the UK and I strongly support the Bill as a result.

There is another reason for caution about buying SAF from elsewhere: I think the UK approach is much smarter and much better. In the United States, SAF is being produced primarily from corn. In the EU, SAF will be produced, as we have heard, from what is called HEFA—basically, used cooking oil. I absolutely do not support growing fuel in fields that could be used for growing food. I have long been uneasy about the practice of growing crops for purposes other than food, but I think it is mad to use the space that the world needs to feed itself to grow aviation fuel. The UK is right also to accept for now, I think, that HEFA will be needed for the time being, but we need to understand that it is not going to be there for ever, and it is right that its future use is capped.

There are serious question marks about the availability of HEFA and there is also the suggestion that it is often not really used cooking oil at all but near-virgin oil that has been doctored to create the semblance that it has been used in a kitchen. Of course, much of it comes from the Far East, and SAF mandates are going to spread there too, so there is absolutely no certainty of supply going forward. The UK’s approach, which has been to push quickly towards SAF produced from biowaste, of which we have quite a lot here already, and then in due course from municipal waste, has to be the right one. To me, this really is the nirvana of sustainable aviation fuel: if we can turn our waste—what we put in our black bins each week—into fuel oil, removing the impact of landfill, incineration and the rest, that has to be a good thing.

I have a question for the Minister, and this is the first of the points I want to put to him. There are rumours around that the Government want to allow first-generation SAF from crops here. I really hope that is not true and I ask the Minister to set that to rest by confirming that there are no such plans. We should not be growing agricultural crops to turn into fuel. We have taken a much smarter approach in this country to delivering aviation fuel that has a positive environmental impact. We must not see that compromised in any way.

There are a number of other issues I have with the Bill that I want to put to the Minister. I want to see these issues addressed in the debates ahead, and there is at least one that I am very committed to asking the Government or this House to put in the Bill.

My first concern is about how the levy is applied on conventional aviation fuel manufacturers. I know that the Government’s initial intent was to assign the levy based on the previous year’s market share. I genuinely do not think that approach is viable. It misses out the impact of changes in the composition of the market, which could mean that a new player faces a period without charges and is able to undercut the existing market. The levelling-up process would then come way down the track, after a long period of time when there had been a real price discrepancy between the two and a competitive advantage to the newcomer.

Also, if someone disappears from the market—and we have seen two refineries close in recent times—such a delay will also cause complications for the counterparty. So, the mechanism to apply the levy has got to be immediate. I do not understand why it cannot just be done per barrel of fuel as it leaves the refinery or the terminal. I think the Minister needs to explain to all of us why that cannot happen. I appreciate that that is going to come in the secondary legislation, but we need to understand how it is going to be applied, and it has got to be done in a timely way. It cannot happen way after the event.

I was grateful to the Minister for spending some time with me and allowing his officials to spend some time with me. I know they have thought about this, but I ask him to now put some of the Government’s thinking about this on the record, so we can understand where it is going as we go through the Bill.

My second concern is there has got to be a direct link between the commencement of the levy and the opening of the first SAF plant. We do not realistically expect the first SAF plant in the UK to be operational much before 2030. So, the levy cannot start until close to 2030, otherwise we would be raising money—which passengers are paying more for—and just leaving it sitting in the bank. It is important that there has to be a clear linkage between the arrival of SAF manufacturing in the UK and the application of the levy.

On the timeframe, there is one other thing I would just ask the Minister to consider. At the moment, because there is not an awful lot of SAF capacity anywhere in the world, we must not apply the mandate on a ratchet scale up to 2030 in a way that is detached from the reality of the availability of SAF in the marketplace. I would ask him to keep monitoring the mandate as we go towards 2030 and make sure we are not actually out of kilter with the availability of SAF for the airlines to put in their planes.

The third concern I would ask the Minister to address is there has got to be no legal doubt whatever that the proceeds of the levy will be used only to support investment in the manufacturing of SAF in the UK. There has just got to be a proper safeguard against any other part of Government going, “Oh, there’s some money there. We’ll have that for something else”. It does happen; it has happened in other countries in similar areas. We need that certainty in the Bill.

I think the most important addition to the Bill—and I would ask the Minister to go away and think about this, because it must be in primary legislation, so there is no doubt in the courts going forward—would be to make it absolutely certain that the revenue support mechanism is going to be used only to support the production of SAF in the UK. There has got to be no legal doubt about this and no loopholes whatever.

The Government already know that there are loopholes out there and there are people trying to take advantage of them. The Government have already had to stop one multinational in the hydrogen marketplace from benefiting from UK financial support while planning to produce part of its product in the Middle East. It would be relatively easy for a manufacturer of SAF to import an intermediate fuel into the UK, process it at a SAF plant and claim the benefits the RCM would offer. The legislation has got to be absolutely categoric: that cannot be allowed to happen.

I would like the Bill to say very explicitly that any certified fuel that is a component of SAF has to be manufactured in the UK and that only the feedstock can be imported. Of course, there will be times when we buy biowaste from other European countries—that is perfectly reasonable. But you cannot be allowed to produce a three-quarters-finished fuel that you just adjust, turn into SAF at the end and claim that that should benefit from the revenue support mechanism. I would only countenance the feedstock as being imported, and hopefully, as we see the move towards urban municipal waste and even sewage turned into fuel, even that will not be necessary.

It is really important that we have that in the Bill, because courts do strange things. They interpret laws in different ways, sometimes in ways that those in Parliament do not expect or do not want to be the case. We have got to have absolute certainty on that in primary legislation. I mention this now to the Minister ahead of Committee to give him advance warning that I really want to explore this in detail.

I believe the Bill to be essential to the UK, benefiting from a new industry that we have ourselves mandated as essential to one of our most important and oldest sectors. It makes no sense to tell airlines to buy SAF but then ignore the opportunity to produce it here and let other Governments incentivise their own investments and industries instead.

I am very glad that both the last Government and this one accepted the intent behind that amendment two years ago, and I look forward to seeing the Bill pass into law. Our job in this House is to make sure it leaves no loopholes and then to encourage the Government to get on with the secondary legislation, so that contracts and the constructions can begin as quickly as possible.

Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb (GP) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My Lords, I welcome the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester. I was absolutely delighted to hear him remind the House that there is no spare planet. Quite honestly, the rate at which we humans are trashing our planet suggests that we actually do think we can go to Mars, or something spectacular like that, and still live a good life. However, I point out that if we destroy this very beautiful planet, or make it increasingly less beautiful and diverse, our lives will be utterly constrained as well.

I like to say something nice about the Government occasionally, if I possibly can. I noted the Minister’s statement at the start that this Bill aims for a greener, cleaner future for aviation. That is a very noble aim, but I am afraid it is impossible unless we radically rethink how we are going to deal with it.

About 25 years ago, when I was on the London Assembly, we assembly members and the mayor, then Ken Livingstone, had a presentation by Heathrow representatives. They promised—this is 25 years ago, remember—that Heathrow could become sustainable within a few years. They claimed it should be given permission to expand because it would soon be polluting less.

It took us a couple of years, but the mayor and the assembly soon realised that Heathrow had lied. It still lies about expansion and pollution. It lies about how important it is to the economy and about how much public subsidy it gets. The truth is that the aviation industry cares about profits, not the environment. You can no more have sustainable aviation than you can have a crocodile with a conscience; it just does not exist.

There is absolutely no techno fix for the pollution that aviation causes. The Royal Society worked out that to reach net zero for aviation fuel—is this what we are snappily calling “jet zero”?—we need at least half the UK’s agricultural land to grow the raw materials. That would be over two-thirds if farmers only grew rapeseed.

That means less wheat, barley and fodder for livestock. That also means higher prices for cereals and food. We already have food inflation due to floods in some areas and droughts in others. Last year, the 2025 UK harvest was the second worst on record. If the Government want farmers to grow jet fuel instead of food, prices in the shops are going to rise in order to keep the planes flying.

As we enter the era of climate crisis impacting on world food production, our country will have less farming land but will want more of it devoted to support the oxymoronic idea of sustainable aviation. In the past 25 years, the UK has lost 771,000 hectares of farmland, contributing to a 12% fall in food self-sufficiency. That decline is about to get worse with the disastrous planning Bill the Government have passed.

I love the effort going into expanding renewable energy and battery storage, but as the Climate Committee has pointed out, that does not stop aviation becoming the number one contributor to emissions in the next few decades.

This Government have lost all claim to be a green Government, with their attack on nature in Britain and their decision to expand aviation. The go-ahead for the expansion of London City Airport, Luton, Gatwick and Stansted means an extra 51 million passengers per annum. If the Government add Heathrow to that total, that is an extra 65 million passengers. If all those extra flights result in either extra emissions or extra farmland taken up growing jet fuel, that means rising fuel prices and more public subsidy.

Of course, the reality is that we will not switch two-thirds of our farming land to jet fuel. The whole Bill is greenwash, designed to provide political cover for aviation expansion and bigger profits. The real solutions are to tax private jets and the ultra-frequent flyers, to stop short-haul flights, and to make train journeys cheaper and more reliable. The solution is less flying, not this fiction of sustainable aviation.

A noble Lord mentioned “flight shaming”; I am not trying to do that. It is understandable that families want to go on holiday once a year, but as the noble Earl, Lord Russell, pointed out, 70% of flights are taken by 15% of the population, which suggests that those people are grabbing their unfair share of the pollution that we can each expect to produce. Therefore, I ask the Minister: does he approve of making train journeys cheaper and more reliable, and putting a tax on private aircraft and frequent flyers?

I said to the owners of Heathrow 20 years ago—much to their annoyance, “If you want to show how environmental you are, then go ahead and fix the major problems of noise and air pollution and stop ruining the climate. Once you’ve done that, then, and only then, can we have a conversation about expansion of airports and of aviation”. I am so disappointed that this Government cannot see that. I recognise that they feel the need to explain that aviation can go on just as it has in the past, but that simply is not true.

Lord Harper (Con) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My Lords, I declare my interest as a non-executive chair of RVL Aviation.

I too congratulate the right reverend Prelate on his excellent maiden speech. Before he started speaking, I wondered whether he was going to set out the Church of England’s policy on sustainable aviation. I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent content of his speech and look forward to his further contributions in the House. The bit I will particularly remember is his injunction to be “kindly present”, which we should all strive to do. If I ever require someone to provide a reference for me, I will think of the noble Lord, Lord Raval, who spent most of his speech, rather than talking about the Bill, saying fantastic things that the right reverend Prelate would have been too humble to have said himself. He painted a rich picture of the right reverend Prelate’s skills, and I look forward to his future contributions.

The noble Baroness, Lady Jones, will not be surprised to learn that I disagreed with almost every word of her speech. On flying, she referred to the ability of people to go on holiday. We had a very interesting test case during the pandemic, when, in effect, we told people—albeit not for this reason—that they could not fly. Listening to constituents then as a Member of Parliament made clear to me the breadth of reasons why people value aviation. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester touched on some of them, including aviation bringing people together and enabling people to see friends and family around the world. It is not just about holidays; it is about bringing people together.

I also do not share the noble Baroness’s distaste for frequent flyers. Most of the people who do frequent flying are those involved in business, in global investment and in growing both the British and the global economy, which is essential to generate the wealth that we will need to green the economy and to make it more sustainable. We will get public acceptance for a lot of this only if we also make people better off, so it is incredibly important that we support flying and enable more people to fly. I want people who currently do not have the opportunity to fly, both in the United Kingdom and globally, to have the chance to do so.

Where I do agree with the noble Baroness is that we absolutely need to do that sustainably. It will be done by the use of technology. Before I move on to the subject of the Bill, it is worth me saying that a range of technologies are available. When I was Secretary of State, I was surprised by the unanimity across the aviation industry—airlines, airports and the aerospace sector involved in developing technology and manufacturing planes—on the importance of sustainability and decarbonisation. We never had any arguments with the industry or had to push it in this direction; it was already there and moving at pace. I found that incredibly encouraging.

Innovative companies based in the United Kingdom, such as ZeroAvia, are working on the technology around hydrogen fuel cells, which will be available in the future. I will discuss SAF in a moment, but there are also companies working on electric planes. There is also the important work that the Government are doing on airspace modernisation, which we kicked off when I was Secretary of State; that will also make a contribution. To get to net-zero aviation, we will also need to use—for the bit you cannot abate with plane technology—carbon capture and storage, and I know that a great deal of work is going on in that space, too.

I was very pleased to see the Government carry on our Jet Zero Council, which they now call the Jet Zero Taskforce—the renaming is a minor detail. That brings together industry, government, academia and, importantly, representatives from the Climate Change Committee, who provide helpful advice. They therefore learn about where the technology has got to, to inform the advice that the Climate Change Committee then provides to the Government. That is very welcome.

On sustainable aviation fuel, my noble friend Lord Grayling referred to the VS100 flight that Virgin Atlantic put on; it was funded by Virgin Atlantic but also supported by a contribution from the taxpayer because of a competition run by my predecessor. That flight took place in November 2023 and captured enormous public interest and attention. It was one of the rare occasions that I was able to do the morning broadcast round standing in front of a plane at Heathrow Airport—a great backdrop. It also had a good response from broadcasters, who found the whole thing very interesting and who did great explainers for the public on some of this technology; they wished us well with the endeavour, which is not something that broadcasters usually did to Ministers doing the morning broadcast round. It captured attention not just in Britain but around the world. When I went, shortly afterwards, to the climate change conference, COP 28, I was able to speak about that flight, which was a very good example of Britain leading the way in this area and demonstrating the value of technology.

We then started developing and consulting on the SAF mandate, which, in effect, provides the demand side of the equation for sustainable aviation fuel. I am very pleased again that, with the present Government, there has been enormous continuity in policy in this area.

On the supply side, the Minister referred to the excellent work being done by the Aerospace Technology Institute, which I also support. As has been mentioned, including by my noble friend Lord Davies of Gower, the capital cost of the domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel has been supported from the advanced fuels fund. I think the third round of that took place recently; the first round happened when we were in government. I would be interested if, in his winding-up speech, the Minister could provide us with an update on where the development of those plants has got to and when we might see more. My noble friend Lord Grayling suggested one timeframe for that, as did my noble friend Lord Davies. If the Minister gives us an update on progress in this area, it would be helpful if he also sets out something that my noble friend Lord Grayling also touched on, which is the value that the Government place on domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel.

There is a national resilience case for that, because again we saw during the pandemic that countries, regardless of the contractual obligations that businesses had, very much protected their domestic supply of this sort of fuel. We can quickly find that our reliance on getting this from overseas rapidly dries up. Having some domestic resilience is very important, and I would be grateful if the Minister could set out the Government’s view.

The specific purpose of the Bill is the revenue certainty mechanism. My noble friend Lord Grayling touched on this, and I clearly remember what I might term his rebel amendment to force the pace. It was good that he provoked that debate. I must confess that, when I was Secretary of State, I took quite a bit of persuading about the need for the revenue certainty mechanism. I will say a few words about that, because it will be helpful in posing some questions to the Minister, both here and when we are in Committee.

When the industry and my noble friend were lobbying for this, I was clear that I wanted to understand what the market failure was that we were trying to fix with the revenue support mechanism. We have ended up with a clear enunciation of it in the Explanatory Notes for the Bill. In his opening remarks, the Minister touched on this and talked about how the need to develop first-of-a-kind technology, which is not currently in existence, requires a significant amount of capital and is very high risk.

The caveat is that, when I had some round-table discussions with some of the investors, both here and in the United States, they understandably quite liked the idea of some guaranteed demand through a mandate. They also quite liked the idea of guaranteed pricing through a revenue certainty mechanism. I gently pointed out to them that they have to take some risk in this process in order to justify the return. The trick here is not to remove all risk, but to get the risk to the level of comparable investment projects, so that we make sure that we get appropriate levels of investment. But we must guard against what has happened in some of the rest of the energy sector, with very long-run contracts guaranteeing returns to investors that are higher than are strictly necessary, with the costs being paid by the consumer.

It is important that, when the detailed work is done, we get the balance right between securing the investment in domestic SAF production, minimising the cost to the consumer and getting the length of the contractual terms right. I do not pretend that that is easy, but it will be important to do it. In Committee, I think we will be discussing how to design the levy obligations on the fuel suppliers. My noble friend Lord Grayling touched on some of the detailed questions, such as how the levy interacts with the UK’s emissions trading scheme, the CORSIA scheme that has been set up internationally and the EU scheme, particularly as the free allocations for aviation under the emissions trading scheme expire.

Some argue that payments under the emissions trading scheme should be used to fund sustainable aviation fuel plants, rather than creating yet another obligation. I would be interested if the Minister set out how he and the Government see those schemes interacting with each other to ensure that consumers do not pay more than once.

My final point, which was also touched on by my noble friend Lord Grayling, is about the composition of sustainable aviation fuel and the international dimension to this. It is quite right—I agree in principle with what my noble friend Lord Grayling said—that we should not be using land that could be used for food crops to produce SAF. But there is one thing that we need to be realistic about, which maybe we should not have to but we do.

There is a big lobby in the US, which my noble friend touched on, that wants to use corn ethanol for SAF. Normally, I would be very much against that. The only argument in favour of it is whether it may be necessary to engage the United States Administration, who are not enormously well disposed towards sustainability and net zero, about what international agreements we may need to have with them, because it is really important in this area to keep the United States Administration broadly aligned. Given that aviation is by definition an international industry, it will be quite difficult to decarbonise the industry if the United States is heading in a different direction. Therefore, I would be interested to know what discussions the British Government are having with the United States Government about trying to keep them in this space and what sorts of discussions are going on with fuel providers. The only argument for using food crops for this would be that if by doing so we could keep the United States in this space.

However, in summary, I strongly support aviation and strongly support making it more sustainable. That will be done not by stopping people flying but by using technology—all the technology. Sustainable aviation fuel is the technology solution that is going to be available first—it is available now. The Virgin flight that I referred to demonstrated that you can have a 100% sustainable aviation fuel flight that works. It is a drop-in fuel with existing technology, and the revenue certainty mechanism that is enabled by the Bill, if the design of it is correct—we will test some of that in Committee—will help get that domestic production up and running. With those caveats, I support the Bill and look forward to further debate in Committee with the Minister and, I suspect, a number of the noble Lords who are here today.

Viscount Trenchard (Con) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My Lords, I add my congratulations to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester on his entertaining and informed speech. He should moonlight and take a second job on the Climate Change Committee.

It is a great pleasure for me to follow my noble friend Lord Harper, who rightly stressed that we should continue to lead the way in developing new technologies. Perhaps the Government could pay more attention to the absurdly high level of electricity costs in this country and the high levels of taxation.

I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill today. I have been a frequent flier for most of my working life and still travel regularly overseas, especially to the Far East. So I declare my interest as set out in the register, especially in connection with advising Japanese companies and British companies with regard to their Japanese business.

My noble friend Lord Grayling knows a great deal about this subject and made a compelling speech. The rapid adoption of SAF is still broadly supported by the Conservative Party, but I believe the sands have been shifting on the whole question of how quickly and at what cost businesses and individuals should be compelled to adopt a net-zero and clean energy agenda. In particular, if the larger carbon dioxide emitters, such as China and developing countries in Africa and Asia, are not imposing similar constraints on market forces in their countries, logic suggests that we should not do so either.

It seems to me that the effect of the Bill is to distort the market for sustainable aviation fuel. I suspect that the cost of this distortion will be borne ultimately by consumers. The Bill is about the creation of a revenue certainty contract, which will, in effect, insulate the quango which will be created as the counterparty from market risk. I am very sceptical about the Government’s claim that the net cost per passenger of implementing the revenue certainty mechanism will be between minus £1.50 and plus £1.50 per passenger. How can this be possible if the cost of the SAF itself is going to be more like £10 per passenger? In any event, ticket prices have soared beyond our wildest expectations over the last few years, so whether the cost of the RCM amounts to one cup of coffee or 100 cups of coffee is not really relevant.

I am not certain that forcing an increase from 2% to 22% of the SAF component of aviation fuels over the next 15 years is likely to save the planet. Can the Minister tell us whether the Government will interfere with airlines’ freedom to refuel their aircraft in other jurisdictions at will, including those that either have not imposed any mandate for inclusion of SAF or have imposed a less onerous one? I am not sure that the performance in miles per gallon of cars using E10 fuels is not slightly inferior to that of cars using E5 fuel, and I ask the Minister to tell the House what evidence there is that fuel economy and, crucially, safety are not at all impacted by the quite steep and burdensome mandate imposed on an already challenged aviation sector.

My noble friend Lord Davies of Gower in his interesting speech encouraged me to be more positive about SAF and to recognise its benefits and its importance. But he did point out that the Government’s mandate will be difficult to achieve without diverging from HEFA-based SAFs, and there is doubt about whether second- or third-generation SAFs will work well. There are more than 160 ships powered by small nuclear reactors, and the noble Lord, Lord Ravensdale, rightly drew attention to nuclear power as a potential source of power for aircraft. In particular, he pointed out that high-temperature gas-cooled reactors enable the production of hydrogen at scale, and hydrogen technologies are already capable of powering aircraft. Airbus plans to have commercial hydrogen aircraft in service by 2035. Unfortunately, the Government’s hydrogen strategy does not recognise the role of nuclear in producing hydrogen at all. I ask the Minister why this is the case. Our Japanese friends are disappointed that we are moving so slowly with their project to develop high-temperature gas-cooled reactor technology with the National Nuclear Laboratory and believe that Poland may be a better partner than we are likely to be.

Can the Minister tell the House about the counterparty? He is going to have a great number of powers to direct it. How many people will it employ, and what does he expect will be its annual cost of operation? The Bill is designed to enforce a piece of industrial policy. Is the Minister certain that the counterparty will be well placed to manufacture SAFs competitively in this country, given our very high energy costs? Surely, if either the taxpayer or the consumer is going to have to pay for the cost of the counterparty and its activities, it follows that the legislation should require the Government to monitor costs and that the counterparty should be required to prioritise British technologies. Can the Minister tell the House why the Government declined to accept a perfectly reasonable and sensible amendment to require transparency over the effect of any revenue certainty contract on ticket prices, on both a one-year view and a five-year view?

I note that Jonathon Counsell of IAG, in his evidence to the Public Bill Committee in another place, raised the question as to whether the Government’s estimate of plus £1.50 to minus £1.50 really included all elements of the counterparty’s costs. If the Government did not like the amendment moved by my right honourable friend Richard Holden, could the Minister not undertake to bring forward the Government’s own amendment to achieve the same purpose? It is beyond doubt that the public and the consumer are entitled to know that the costs of this new foray into industrial policy will be strictly monitored.

How will the Minister ensure that the counterparty will ensure that any contract leading to the establishment of a new factory will prioritise the use of British technologies? We would certainly welcome the Minister telling the House how we can ensure that new factories will prioritise the use of British technologies. I look forward to hearing the Minister’s winding-up speech and to working with other noble Lords to improve the Bill, which is absolutely necessary.

Viscount Hanworth (Lab) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My Lords, the carbon content of fossil fuels has been accumulating over eons by the removal of carbon dioxide from the earth’s atmosphere via biological processes of photosynthesis, depending on chlorophyll and powered by sunlight. Such processes are highly efficient in their use of energy but they are far too weak and gradual to remove from the atmosphere the quantities of carbon dioxide that have been emitted by burning fossil fuels.

Capturing this carbon dioxide requires artificial processes that are far less efficient than the biological processes and far more consumptive of energy. Only by expending a large amount of energy that could be supplied by nuclear fission, and possibly in the long run by nuclear fusion, can there be any hope of cleansing the atmosphere of its excess carbon dioxide. According to a recent analysis, about 3% of carbon emissions are due to aviation. This figure is rising. We have heard that it is about 7% of UK emissions. Jet aircraft consume high-octane kerosene, which is refined from petroleum. Each flight powered by hydrocarbons adds to the burden of atmospheric carbon dioxide. If global heating due to carbon dioxide is to be addressed, something must be done to staunch the carbon emissions of aviation.

The problem is that there is no viable means of powering long-haul aviation other than kerosene, which has an unequalled energy density. Moreover, the technology of jet turbines, which has developed over the past 80 years, is not easily replaceable. Electric batteries or hydrogen fuel cells can be used in short-haul aviation, but their weight penalty precludes their use in long-haul aviation. Hydrogen, which has been used to power space rockets, has been proposed as an alternative for aviation fuel. Hydrogen has a very high energy content per mass, which is significantly greater than that of gasoline, but it has a low energy density per volume, meaning that it requires a large space to store it, even when compressed or liquefied. Liquid hydrogen has an energy content of about 5.6 megajoules per litre, whereas gasoline has about 32 megajoules per litre—almost six times as much. To use hydrogen to power aircraft would require a technology radically different from the current aviation technology, which would take a long time to develop. Its efficiency in transporting passengers would be severely limited by the storage requirements of the fuel.

If we are to sustain the present aviation technology, we need to develop sustainable aviation fuels, or SAFs. The ultimate requirement for such fuels is that they should emit to the atmosphere no greater quantities of carbon dioxide than are removed from the atmosphere for the purpose of creating their carbon feedstock. At present, so-called sustainable aviation fuel, which forms a very small proportion of the total supply of fuel for aviation, depends on a carbon feedstock that originates in biomass. Such aviation fuel cannot be relied on to reduce significantly the net emissions of carbon dioxide. They can have a beneficial effect only if the net supply of biomass can be increased to cover their use.

There are three cases to consider. First, the carbon feedstock might be grown for the purpose without displacing any other processes, but this is unlikely to happen. Secondly, the feedstock might be freely available, such as materials that would otherwise be consigned to landfill. Finally, and at worst, the production of the feedstock could displace other activities, such as the growth of foodstuffs.

Only in the first case, where there might be a net increase in photosynthesis, could there be a subtraction from atmospheric carbon dioxide. In the other cases, the emission of carbon dioxide from burning the fuel would be more rapid than if it had resulted from the natural decay of the feedstock, which might gradually add carbon dioxide and methane to the atmosphere.

It should be observed that wood, unless it is burned, will lock away carbon for many human generations. Therefore, forestry products should not be used as a carbon feedstock for synthetic fuels. Sustainable aviation fuel will deserve its name only if its carbon content can be removed directly from the atmosphere via the so-called technology of direct air capture.

This Bill has the ambition of stimulating the production of sustainable aviation fuels. It proposes to do so via minor financial interventions modelled on those that intend to encourage investment in renewable means of generating electricity.

The Bill itemises three levels, or generations, of SAF production. The first-generation SAFs are made from hydrogenated esters and fatty acids derived from oils or fats, such as used cooking oil. The second-generation SAFs are to be made from waste sources, including so-called municipal solid waste. The third-generation SAFs, also known as power-to-liquid aviation fuel, are to be made by combining hydrogen produced by electrolysis and carbon monoxide, which can be produced from captured carbon dioxide.

Regarding the first generation of SAFs, hydrogenated esters and fatty acids—commonly described as chip fat, because that is their major source—are already pre-empted to produce biodiesel. There is a good deal of mystery and doubt surrounding the second generation of SAFs. Their primary feedstock, which is described as municipal solid waste, is poorly defined, and different processes will be needed to cope with different categories of waste. A website of the British company Johnson Matthey, which is proposing to build plants in the US and Germany to produce second-generation SAFs, mentions a variety of sources for the carbon feedstock, including agricultural residues, forestry biomass, captured carbon dioxide, and the ill-defined municipal solid waste.

At the heart of the second generation of SAFs is the venerable Fischer-Tropsch process, which was invented in Germany in 1925 and used extensively in Germany during the war to create synthetic fuels using coal as the predominant carbon feedstock. The process generates hydrocarbons from syngas, which is a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The syngas will be the product of a gasification plant, which must be specific to the nature of the primary feedstock. If this process were to take its carbon dioxide from captured industrial emissions then it would emit carbon to the atmosphere that might otherwise be sequestered in the ground. The conclusion of this critique is that the only sure way of reducing aviation emissions would be to capture the carbon directly from the atmosphere. In that case, the Fischer-Tropsch process would continue to be used to synthesise the fuel.

The Bill appears to envisage a gradual transition between the three generations of SAF production, and it imagines that this can be achieved by financial incentives that could be structured by the Government. There would be no other government intervention and the Government would bear no costs. The costs would be covered by levies on the aviation industry and maybe by the suppliers of hydrocarbon fuels.

This is a weak proposal for addressing a crisis. The Bill has been inherited from the Conservatives, and it bears the marks of their social and economic philosophies. One might have expected a more interventionist approach from a Labour Government. One is reminded of how an early post-war Labour Government sought to revolutionise the supply of power to industrial and domestic users by creating a completely new industry: the nuclear industry. A similar endeavour would be required to create a sustainable aviation fuel industry, but there is little indication that this will be forthcoming.

Baroness Pidgeon (LD) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My Lords, I congratulate the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester on his excellent maiden speech and his commitment to sustainability and rail, which is music to many of our ears in this House. I look forward to working with him in the months and years to come.

As we have heard today, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill aims to encourage investment in sustainable aviation fuel in the UK by creating a mechanism to guarantee a certain level of revenue. The Bill provides for a guaranteed strike price, guaranteeing price for a producer selling SAF over a defined period. The GSP will be funded via a levy on the aviation industry, specifically through a variable levy on all aviation fuel suppliers over a set period. This legislation should help the industry meet its requirements under the SAF mandate, introduced in January this year, which specifies that at least 10% of all jet fuel used in flights taking off from the UK from 2030 must be made with sustainable fuel, rising to 22% by 2040. This is clearly an area where the UK is trying to lead the way in decarbonising the aviation sector.

However, it should be noted that aviation, with all its benefits in connecting people and businesses, was responsible for almost 30 million tonnes of CO2 in 2022, equivalent to about 7% of the UK’s total emissions. As I understand it, even as emissions from other sectors decline, aviation’s share is projected to rise to 16% by 2035. This is not compatible with our net-zero targets. Sustainable aviation fuel is not a silver bullet, but it is a step forward to help us in the challenging environment that other noble Lords have described.

We on the Liberal Democrat Benches welcome these steps to decarbonise our aviation industry, including investment in sustainable aviation fuels. However, we see SAF as just the first step; we want it to offer a real low-carbon alternative. We believe that the Government should set out how they will go beyond securing investment in SAF and ensure that, longer term, this measure complements rather than detracts from investment in zero-carbon flight technology. We want to see greater innovation, research and development to make the UK the world leader in zero-carbon flight. SAF should be a springboard for that objective rather than a final destination, helping the UK transition to truly climate-friendly options such as battery-electric platforms and hydrogen-fuelled models as these technologies develop. There is a lack of clarity about what level of zero-carbon flight the Government are aiming for, if any, so perhaps the Minister can advise.

It is hard to square an objective of net-zero aviation by 2050 without measures alongside SAF to cut emissions and make climate-friendly flight a reality, and it is hard to look at the decarbonisation of fuel use in aviation while this Government seem intent on expanding airports such as Gatwick and Heathrow, to name just two, leading to many more flights.

There are a number of areas that we will be probing further in Committee. There are some concerns about the levy and the need to ensure that there are no loopholes, that progress is monitored and published and that we are aligned with our European and global neighbours or even ahead of them. Looking at international examples, the EU’s ReFuelEU aviation regulation requires a minimum blend of 2% SAF in 2025, rising to 70% by 2050; it focuses far more on both fuel suppliers and airlines; and, as we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Grayling, it is considering its own revenue support mechanism. Singapore and Thailand’s mandates started a 1% blend in 2026. Japan and South Korea are considering mandates starting some way off, in 2027 and 2030. In China, there is a SAF mandate at 2% that increases to 15% by 2030. Elsewhere, India and Brazil are considering SAF mandates. In the US, while there is no mandate, there is government support, as we have heard, to boost production, in the form of tax credits and other incentives. While there is no consensus on the route map for sustainable aviation fuel and how to support its growth, in developing this mechanism, what international examples have the Government considered to help shape their approach and the Bill before us today?

The levy on fuel producers is not necessarily the wrong approach, but key details are missing and could have unintended consequences if regulations are poorly designed. Leaving the mechanism to be determined later provides useful flexibility for a new and emerging industry. However, assurances are needed on how the mechanism will be designed. One issue that has been raised by industry and by other noble Lords today is that the levy is based on historical market share, which could cause problems. It is not clear if new market entrants might avoid paying the levy if they have no prior market share. Perhaps the Minister can clarify.

Another important issue I have picked up from talking to producers such as Neste is that, although industry in general supports the creation of a revenue certainty mechanism as a means to strengthen investor confidence and unlock the significant investments required for SAF production, there is concern that a level playing field would be guaranteed internationally. There is a strong feeling that revenues of the levy should not be used to support production of SAF that is subsequently exported. This should be about developing and supporting our own UK industry and needs. The levy should be focused on ensuring SAF supply at an affordable price within the UK. Since the UK and EU SAF mandates, I understand that we have seen an increase in the cost of SAF. This mechanism should help with the supply of SAF within the UK and help to ensure a stable price.

I have also been talking to operators that use SAF, for example DHL. In 2024, DHL used 73,000 tonnes of SAF in its own fleet, which is 3.5% of their total fuel share. This is in addition to investing in its fleet to decarbonise and in its ground-handling equipment to move to fully electric. We need to ensure that all operators are looking to decarbonise their whole operations and are not just relying on SAF to tick the green box, in effect.

A final issue that has come up in discussions and been raised by many noble Lords today, including my noble friend Lord Russell, is a concern that the levy will filter down and potentially cost passengers and airlines significantly. Can the Minister explain what assessment the Government have carried out and assure the House that passengers will not be significantly penalised? The combination of a long-term mandate and the proposed revenue support mechanism clearly offers a high degree of regulatory certainty, which is crucial for attracting the significant capital investment needed for SAF production in the UK. I hope the Minister can reassure us on the important points raised today and as we move forward to Committee.

Lord Moylan (Con) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My Lords, what is one to say? The easy part is to start by joining other noble Lords in congratulating the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester on his entertaining and interesting maiden speech, and to welcome him and the many contributions he will no doubt make to your Lordships’ House in the future.

When the Labour Party, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats, even without the support of the Green Party, all agree in supporting a measure, who can withstand them? Some might call it groupthink; others might see in it the spirit that defeated fascism in Europe. But here we are. We have huge support for this Bill from all quarters of the House, but I am afraid that it is the job of the Official Opposition to express a degree of scepticism.

Our debate has ranged very widely indeed, whereas the Bill has a very narrow focus. Many have spoken of it as if it were a net-zero measure. I dispute that. The net-zero measure was the SAF mandate that was put in place, as the Minister said, before Christmas last year, in November, which mandated airlines to use a certain quantity of SAF in their fuel, increasing every year over a period and set out in a statutory instrument. That was certainly a net-zero measure.

However, few noble Lords were open in saying that the Bill is not a net-zero measure as such but an industrial policy measure; in fact, it was really only my noble friend Lord Grayling who was explicit about that. He was explicit also in saying that he supported that industrial policy, which says that not only do we have to require SAF to be used by airlines in this country but we have to be the producer of that SAF. He gave reasons: he said, “Why would you want to use foreign producers? Why would you want to import your SAF?” But there are answers to that.

I am told that there is no future in being an old-fashioned Thatcherite and believing in markets, and that people like me are terribly out of date. However, the noble Baroness, Lady Pidgeon, made clear that SAF mandates are not confined to Britain and the European Union; there are countries all over the world with SAF mandates. She mentioned Thailand and Singapore, and I am sure there are many others as well. SAF is a global business. There is an argument that you might be able to import your SAF more cheaply and have a more efficient market if you were not insisting on producing it all yourself. None the less, the Conservative Party when in power and the Labour Party today have decided on that as a matter of industrial policy.

So what can possibly go wrong, even though it is hard to see what comparative advantage the United Kingdom has as a producer of SAF? The noble Lord, Lord Ravensdale, pointed to one element that seemed pretty damning of our comparative advantage—our very high electricity costs by international standards. He pointed out that this the production of SAF is an electricity-hungry process, but that none the less has to be ignored and overridden.

The Government have decided to be a leader in this uncertain field, and it is uncertain. I think we have agreed that there are three stages of SAF. There is HEFA, which the Government do not want to subsidise, as I understand it, even though, as again the noble Lord, Lord Ravensdale, pointed out, the Bill appears to be drafted so that they could. We need to examine that more closely in Committee. Assuming that the Government do not want to subsidise HEFA, that leaves us with non-HEFA SAF, but the processes for producing non-HEFA SAF are highly uncertain and some of them are first of a kind. We do not even know that they are going to work, but we are putting in place a revenue certainty mechanism so that investors can find out, for practically no risk, whether they are. This is going to be of advantage to the national economy.

Beyond that, as the noble Viscount, Lord Hanworth, said, there is a power-to-liquid option, but the Government do not appear to believe that it is worth investing in that at the moment, even though it is being pursued in the United States with the support of tax credits and, as I understand it, with a large plant in Texas.

Anyway, having decided that this is our industrial policy, we have to find a way of subsidising it. The Treasury has discovered this wonderful thing, the contract for difference, which is a form of subsidy that means that they do not have to shell out any money, because the cost of the subsidy is passed on to the consumer. Contracts for difference have given us the very high electricity costs to which the noble Lord, Lord Ravensdale, referred earlier, which are apparently crippling the process on which we are embarking. So we are to have not a subsidy but a contract for difference, and we are to set up a counterparty that will be able to work that out. It is going to have the skills to negotiate with the hard-faced lawyers sent by the investors to get, as my noble friend Lord Harper said, absolutely that price which offers an appropriate level of reward for the very low level of risk the investors are taking, but not a penny more. Our negotiators will be able to manage that and land it to perfection, and they will have the resources to do that. And so we go on.

Noble Lords have raised a whole series of questions, which I suspect will form the basis of our discussion in Committee. I will add a few myself. Can the Minister clarify whether the Government have made an assessment of the compatibility of the revenue certainty mechanism with the non-discrimination requirements of the WTO’s Article III.4 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, particularly in relation to the differential treatment between qualifying SAF and imported non-qualifying non-fossil aviation fuels such as HEFA? Also, will he indicate—I assure him that I do not necessarily expect him to answer these questions at the Dispatch Box, though it would be very impressive if he did—whether the Government have assessed whether the RCM would constitute a subsidy for the purposes of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, and whether any risk of countermeasures or formal dispute settlement from other WTO members has been identified?

I am sure there are further questions, which I can bring up in Committee, but for the moment, there we are. We stand solidly behind the Bill, but we see a large number of holes in it. We are far from convinced that it will do the job that the Government have said it will set out to do. Whether it can be done at a price of £1.50 per ticket seems to be something else that is worthy of exploration—as is what that figure actually means. Since the mandate increases every year, at what point does the £1.50 come in? Surely, the cost per ticket would rise over the course of time as the mandate requirement rises. We will explore both how it was calculated and what it means but, for the moment, we look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say in response to what has been a lively and well-informed debate.

Lord Hendy of Richmond Hill (Lab) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have engaged in today’s lively debate on the Bill. I have listened with much interest to the excellent points raised across your Lordships’ House, and I will now attempt to answer some of the questions. Of course, we can explore many of the issues in greater detail in Committee. In the meantime, I will follow up as soon as I can on some of the issues that I cannot answer now, but I am grateful for such wide, general cross-party support for this important measure.

First, I should compliment the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester on his maiden speech. He said that sustainability matters; I am so glad that he did, and that he said it in English, because he might have been able to say it in Welsh and I would not have been able to respond. The Government and I are grateful for his support of a vital sustainability measure for air transport, which is essential for the nation’s wealth and defence. The only other thing I should say to the right reverend Prelate at this point is that I am sorry about his train service. I will speak to him separately about the trains to Chester.

As I said, I am grateful for the support of many noble Lords who have spoken. The noble Lord, Lord Davies of Gower, was supportive. The points that he and many others made and the questions he asked were all about making early progress. The Government are pursuing the Bill now, as we did with the SAF mandate, in order to get on and do this, because getting on and doing this is absolutely what we seek achieve. The noble Lord referred to the net effect of this on the price of airfares, as a number of other noble Lords have done. Our best estimate is plus or minus £1.50—we are confident on that—but I am happy to explore that further in Committee. We do not believe it is plus or minus £10. We believe that we have, at least for the moment, explored the cost that would fall on air passengers.

A number of points made by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, were about progress, and this Bill is evidence of the Government making progress. Like other noble Lords, he referred to the point of the first tranche and subsequent tranches. We of course need to move beyond HEFA feedstuffs, which is the point of the further tranches of the revenue support mechanism. The noble Earl also referred to the sustainability of UK plant, which is why the Government have put £63 million into the advanced fuel fund: for the very purpose of ensuring that there are plants in this country which can produce sustainable aviation fuel and that the plants themselves are sustainable.

The noble Lord, Lord Ravensdale, referred to competition in due course. The Bill includes the opportunity for the Secretary of State in due course to run tenders or auctions as a means of developing this market.

The noble Lord, Lord Raval, talked about waste and foodstuffs. We will, as we go through this Bill, have regard to its overall effect on the provision of sustainable aviation fuel.

I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Grayling, for his detailed and compelling speech on this subject and for his great interest. He talked about not allowing crops to be made into SAF. We have committed to publishing a call for evidence by the end of this year on the use of crops in the SAF mandate. The aim is to improve the evidence base on crop-based SAF production, following suggestions from some stakeholders that certain types of crops could be used to increase SAF supply without compromising our approach to sustainability. But we will get information provided through that call for evidence, and we will consider what we find out.

The noble Lord, Lord Grayling, referred particularly to the use of data and how the market price is determined. The counterparty will be responsible for determining the market and should do so by using data that suppliers submit to the SAF mandate reporting system. Our live consultation seeks views on whether the assessment period should use volume data from an earlier period, or—since he suggested that is not sensible—uses forecast volume data. We will have more discussion about that in due course, I am sure. He also made a very strong point about the support being used only for production in the United Kingdom. We intend to support only eligible SAF plants in the UK; I am sure we will discuss that further. It is a strong point and I will consider it as we get to Committee.

The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, talked about cleaner skies and warmer homes. I am aware of the consultation on alternative heating solutions, and we are working with our colleagues in DESNZ to move those forward.

The noble Baroness, Lady Jones, does not agree with this at all. We have discussed the points she was making about aviation before. This is a move towards net zero. We are trying to make aviation more sustainable, as it is not going to stop overnight and is important for the economy of the country. The mandate will save some net additional 54 million tonnes of CO2. On the noble Baroness’s other point about frequent flyers, last year the Government altered air passenger duty which does have an effect on more frequent flyers.

I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Harper. He made some substantial points. The noble Lord referred to a flight that used 100% sustainable aviation fuel; I believe he was a passenger on it. If I may, I will try to respond in detail to the points that the noble Lord made before Committee stage.

The noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard, is perhaps not so supportive, though in the end I think he said he was. But what we are doing is important. We should be trying to move into a market that self-evidently can be a success for British industry, if we approach it properly. Government intervention, as justified by a number of noble Lords this afternoon, is the only way to do it. The noble Viscount is very sceptical of the effect on pricing for passengers; again, I have no doubt that we will discuss this in Committee and afterwards. Of course, he wants safety not to be compromised; none of us does. It is only right to point out that another noble Lord on his Benches was on a flight wholly powered by sustainable aviation fuel and I doubt whether the noble Lord would put himself at risk: I hope he would not. We are absolutely committed to safety. We are also committed to the fuel economy, which he mentioned.

The noble Lord, Lord Ravensdale, referred to nuclear and hydrogen power. The Government have clearly not set their mind against any solution. The significant funding put towards investing in technical solutions and the way in which the SAF process is being developed encourages other solutions and will encourage British industry to look particularly towards these solutions in the longer term. We will, of course, prioritise UK technology. This is the point and it is a good thing to do.

My noble friend Lord Hanworth is also probably not supportive—not because he does not agree with the general principle but because he somehow thinks, despite all we are doing to be at the forefront of global action, including the £63 million we are putting into the advanced fuels fund, that somehow this is not enough and that there should be some red-blooded approach. I contend that this is a pretty red-blooded approach from the Government. Significant sums of public money have been put into it, and we believe that it is the right thing to do.

The noble Baroness, Lady Bloomfield, referred to the nuclear option. SAF produced using nuclear energy is and will be eligible for the SAF mandate. We have provided funding to support the development of this technology through the grant funding programme of the advanced fuels fund. We are clearly on a journey and I note the noble Baroness’s proposition that it will need longer-term support. Although the Bill is limited to a term of 10 years, the support term is not so limited. I hope the noble Baroness will note that this is one of the reasons why.

The noble Baroness, Lady Pidgeon, made some strong points. As I have said, we are on a journey. In Committee, we can discuss the consistency of the trajectory of that journey with the EU and other countries that have set themselves different targets. Of course, it is not the only measure: zero-emission flying is and could not be just about SAF. To that end, we have talked about airspace modernisation, which is something the noble Baroness knows about. We have looked at funding of up to £2.3 billion over 10 years to extend the Aerospace Technology Institute which was announced in the modern industrial strategy in June to look at low-emission and zero-emission aircraft. We are looking at reducing aviation emissions through schemes such as the UK Emissions Trading Scheme on carbon pricing. We are also seeking to address the non-CO2 impacts of aviation. The noble Baroness is correct, of course, in looking at everything to do with carbon reduction in flying, not just aircraft fuel and technology but the operations surrounding aircraft. She mentioned the activities in that respect of DHL, which is a major user of aircraft.

Lastly, the noble Lord, Lord Moylan, for whom I have huge respect, appears to see a conspiracy between all the parties here to do something which he does not seem to support, which is to have an industrial policy that gives British industry the chance to develop something new in the world and to develop jobs and processes which will lead to a bigger economy. He is not in the same place as some of his colleagues on his own Benches on that and I think that he is wrong, because this is not only an industrial policy but a step towards net zero. He mentioned power-to-liquid, and we have invested in that in the advanced fuels fund. He asked a couple of very detailed questions about the World Trade Organization, and I would be delighted to write to him with the answers, supposing that I was unable to provide answers from the Dispatch Box just now.

Once again, I thank all noble Lords who participated in the debate today and I welcome the support of the many who spoke in favour of the Bill’s measures. The Bill will kick-start the UK SAF industry, attracting investment and creating jobs. By addressing the market and investment uncertainty in SAF production, it will enable the UK to lead the way to greener aviation.

The U.S. Department of Energy on Nov. 20 announced an organizational realignment. The current Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and Bioenergy Technologies Office are among the DOE departments that will be impacted.

In a statement, the DOE said the organizational realignment is “designed to strengthen DOE’s ability to execute President Trump’s bold agenda to restore American energy dominance.” The agency noted that the “realignment reflects the administration’s priorities of expanding American energy production, accelerating scientific and technological leadership, and ensuring the continued safety and readiness of the Nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile.”

“Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, the Energy Department is aligning its operations to restore commonsense to energy policy, lower costs for American families and businesses, and ensure the responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “These changes will help us better execute the DOE mission of delivering affordable, reliable and secure American energy for the American people.""

The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy is currently housed under the Office of the Under Secretary for Science and Innovation and headed by the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. Currently, the EERE contains 10 technology offices, including the Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO), along with offices dedicated to advanced materials and manufacturing, buildings, geothermal, hydrogen and fuel cell, industrial efficiency and decarbonization, solar energy, vehicle technologies, water power and wind energy.

The BETO focuses on research, development and demonstration of technologies aimed to enable the use of domestic biomass and waste resources for the production of biofuels and bioproducts. It currently spearheads efforts related to the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Grand Challenge, CO2 utilization, transportation biofuels, waste-to-energy innovation, bioproducts production, wood heater innovation, and algae. BETO is also the DOE office that has published and updated the Billion-Ton Report.

According to a DOE spokesperson, the EERE has been renamed the Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation (CMEI). Some functions associated with the DOE’s Grid Deployment Office, Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, Office of State and Community Energy Programs, and Fossil Energy and Carbon Management have also been realigned to the newly formed CMEI. An update flow chart released by the agency indicates the CMEI will no longer be housed under the Office of Science.

The DOE did not elaborate on how the many functions of the EERE and BETO will be impacted as the agency rolls out the organizational realignment.

Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav made the case during a meeting of the JCM’s 11th partner-country gathering in Belém, Brazil, arguing that the scheme offers a practical blueprint for climate cooperation while advancing development.

Under the JCM, nations partner with Japan to deploy low-carbon technologies, generate emissions reductions, and share credits across borders. As of August 2025, 31 countries, including India, are formally participating.

According to the Japanese Ministry of the Environment, more than 270 projects have already been approved under the mechanism.

At the Belém meeting, hosted by Japan’s environmental ministry and chaired by officials including Hirotaka Ishihara, member states reviewed progress and discussed expansion. Ishihara said Japan is ready to deepen capital commitments, lift barriers to entry, and enhance capacity building for partner nations.

Yadav emphasized that the JCM closely aligns with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which enables cooperative approaches for emissions trading and crediting. He highlighted that the bilateral partnership allows private companies and governments to jointly invest in green technology, finance projects, and allocate emissions reductions transparently.

In India’s eyes, the JCM dovetails with its own climate objectives: the credits generated under the mechanism support its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and long-term low-emission strategy. Yadav pointed to key sectors like green hydrogen, renewable energy with storage, sustainable aviation fuel, and green ammonia as priorities for collaboration.

Seeks to expand XCF’s international reach into key markets including Europe and the Middle East through production, offtake, and co-branded distribution agreements

Advances global renewable fuel supply chains to meet rapidly rising demand for SAF

XCF Global, Inc. (“XCF”) (Nasdaq:SAFX), a leader in advancing the decarbonization of the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”), today announced that it has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding(“MOU”) with BGN INT US LLC (“BGN”), a global renewable fuels trading, marketing, and distribution company, to explore developing a global distribution and logistics partnership for SAF, renewable diesel (“RD”), and renewable naphtha (“RN”) (together, “renewable fuel”).

Under the MOU, XCF and BGN intend to evaluate opportunities to collaborate on renewable fuel production, marketing, and distribution across multiple regions around the world, including Europe and the Middle East. The proposed framework includes offtake and co-branded distribution agreements, as well as joint development of renewable fuel production capacity. In addition, the proposed strategic partnership seeks to promote the use of XCF’s SAF within industry trade associations and OEM networks, and throughout the customer value chain.

Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, commented:

“This collaboration represents a critical step in expanding the global reach of renewable fuels. Partnering with BGN would enable us to extend our footprint, streamline logistics, and accelerate commercialization on a global scale with a world-class partner, as we prepare to meet surging demand for sustainable aviation fuel.

“This MOU reflects a shared vision to advance a scalable, commercially viable framework for global renewable fuel production and distribution.”

Cenan Ozmeral, President of BGN Int. US, LLC added:

“We are pleased to be partnering with US based XCF in this exciting venture. BGN and XCF share a common goal to expand access to renewable fuels and accelerate the decarbonization of the aviation industry. Together, we aim to combine XCF’s scalable production model with BGN’s marketing and distribution network to create a seamless, efficient supply chain from feedstock to finished fuel.

“BGN’s trading strength, risk management expertise, and integrated logistics network, will make SAF adoption practical and commercially viable for airlines seeking to meet tightening decarbonization targets. This is a major step, which we believe will have a significant impact on the aviation industry’s ability to reduce emissions, in one of the hardest-to-abate transport sectors.”

The collaboration underscores both companies’ commitment to building a robust global supply chain at a time when demand for SAF is expanding rapidly. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), airlines will need approximately 165 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2050 to meet net-zero emission targets. Meeting this demand would require the construction of up to 7,000 new facilities worldwide. Analysts project that the global SAF market could exceed $25 billion by 2030 and reach ~$270 billion by 2050, underscoring one of the most compelling growth opportunities in the global energy transition.

This MOU is non-binding, and execution remains subject to customary due diligence, technical validation, and final agreements.

The Congressional Biofuels Caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives relaunched in May for the 119th Congress. Originally established in the 114th Congress (2015-2017), the group is made up of 36 Representatives from both parties who champion policies that support the growing role of biofuels in meeting the nation’s most pressing challenges. With members from California to Minnesota, the caucus represents the strong, bipartisan support for biofuels that is growing across the nation.

“American biofuel producers have an untapped ability to power the future of liquid fuels, whether ethanol blends, biodiesel, or sustainable aviation fuel,” said Co-Chair Adrian Smith (R-NE). “Advancing sound policy can unlock billions of dollars in savings at the pump and hundreds of thousands of added jobs for the American people.”

The Congressional Biofuels Caucus has supported issues in the past, including strengthening the Renewable Fuels Standard and improving the availability of E15. In 2023, members of the caucus reintroduced the Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act to ensure that drivers had year-round, nationwide access to E15.

Heading the caucus alongside Rep. Smith are Co-Chairs Angie Craig (D-MN), Ashley Hinson (R-IA), Mark Pocan (D-WI), Julie Fedorchak (R-ND), and Nikki Budzinski (D-IL).

“Increasing the production and availability of homegrown biofuels is a critical piece of the puzzle when it comes to the all-of-the-above energy policy we need to stay ahead,” said Co-Chair Angie Craig. “I’m proud to be relaunching the Biofuels Caucus alongside my bipartisan colleagues this Congress so we can continue our work to lower prices at the pump, create opportunities for local producers and strengthen our energy security.”

Additional members of the caucus include: Reps.

Todd Good with ADM says the Columbus, Nebraska, facility creates additional processing capacity and demand for corn. “Ethanol in and of itself has been for a long time a somewhat oversupplied industry. Depending on what the margins are at any given time, we may decide to run below our name-plate capacity. This allows us to change to where we are running closer to that.”

The project captures carbon dioxide from ADM’s ethanol plant and transports it through Tallgrass’s Trailblazer pipeline to a secure underground storage site in Wyoming.

Good tells Brownfield the process creates a more sustainable and environmentally healthy product. “What this CO2 sequestration effectively does is it will lower the carbon intensity of our ethanol, and what we hope that will make it more attractive for different end uses.”

As an example, he says it could help produce sustainable aviation fuel. “One pathway to get to SAF is through ethanol. To be able to do that, carbon sequestration is important.”

The pipeline can transport over 10 million tons of CO2 annually — roughly equivalent to removing 2 million passenger vehicles from the road — helping support sustainable farming and biofuel production.",https://cdn.brownfieldagnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/4_Ethanol.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 15:56:46.511350

Historically destined for landfill or incineration, residual waste is now being re-evaluated as a potentially high-leverage resource for carbon mitigation.
Research Questions Which pathway delivers greater climate benefit per tonne of residual MSW in the UK context: EfW with CCS or waste-derived SAF?
Its climate benefit is dominated by permanent carbon dioxide removal from the biogenic fraction of waste.
This approach must evaluate allocation based on system-wide mitigation effectiveness and the permanence of climate benefit.","Professor Mathieu Lucquiaud, University of Sheffield, was awarded funding in the UKCCSRC’s Flexible Funding 2024 call to look at “Transforming Waste Into a Climate Service (TWICS): A Comparative Assessment of Energy-from-Waste with CCS and Waste-derived Sustainable Aviation Fuels”.

Executive Summary

Municipal solid waste (MSW) is emerging as a contested climate mitigation tool, subject to competing claims from sectors pursuing decarbonisation under resource constraints. In the UK, MSW is targeted both for carbon dioxide removal via energy-from-waste (EfW) with carbon capture and storage (CCS) and as a feedstock for producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). These pathways are not complementary, each tonne of waste directed to one excludes its use in the other, yet current policy frameworks incentivise them in isolation without internalising the opportunity cost of allocation.

This study compares the climate performance of EfW with CCS and MSW-to-SAF using a consequential life cycle assessment framework aligned with ISO 14044. The aim is to inform climate-optimal waste allocation by quantifying the system-level greenhouse gas (GHG) implications of each route. Both pathways deliver net-negative emissions under baseline assumptions, but the mechanisms and sensitivities differ. EfW with CCS derives its benefit primarily from permanent biogenic carbon removal, while the SAF route relies solely on upstream fossil fuel displacement and material recovery credits.

The analysis shows that EfW with CCS generally provides the greater GHG benefit per tonne of MSW, achieving up to −1215 kg CO2-eq. in the base case and remaining net-negative (−610 kg CO2-eq.) even under conservative assumptions that exclude all credits from avoided burdens. In contrast, SAF delivers a smaller but notable benefit of up to −700 kg CO2-eq.

A sensitivity analysis on the biogenic carbon fraction of waste reveals a break-even point at 5%, below which SAF would become the more climate-effective option, compared to 50-70% biogenic carbon fraction in most post-residual waste feedstock. The findings raise questions about the traditional waste hierarchy, which prioritises material recovery over energy recovery without accounting for the permanence of emissions removal. In a carbon-constrained future, recognising the distinct value of durable carbon dioxide removal (CDR) alongside circular material flows will be essential to coherent and climate-credible waste allocation strategies.

Introduction

The UK faces a strategic challenge in determining how best to utilise residual MSW in pursuit of net-zero climate goals. Historically destined for landfill or incineration, residual waste is now being re-evaluated as a potentially high-leverage resource for carbon mitigation. Its biogenic fraction, arising largely from paper, food, garden, and other organic waste, enables certifiable CDR if captured and permanently stored. This has brought EfW with CCS into sharper focus, particularly as the UK seeks to scale industrial decarbonisation and meet its climate commitments.

Yet EfW is not the only climate-oriented use of residual waste. UK Government policy is actively stimulating the production of waste-derived SAF through the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO). SAF displaces fossil derived aviation fuel, e.g. Jet-A the most common fuel for jet aircraft, in a hard-to-abate sector but emits its carbon at point of use.

Objectives of TWICS

The Transforming Waste Into a Climate Service (TWICS) project seeks to clarify the climate-optimal use of residual municipal solid waste in a policy landscape increasingly characterised by competition, trade-offs, and conflicting incentives. Specifically, the project addresses the unresolved question of whether the UK should prioritise CDR via EfW with CCS, or fossil fuel displacement via the production of waste-derived SAF.

The project objectives are:

Quantify and compare the global warming potential (GWP), avoided emissions, and CDR potential of two divergent waste-to-energy pathways in the UK context: EfW with CCS and MSW-to-SAF.

Model both systems using a harmonised approach in terms of: system boundary, LCA typology, and functional unit.

Assess implications for key policy domains, including: CCUS cluster deployment strategy, SAF mandates and subsidies, and long-term waste resource governance

Provide evidence to guide decisions on where to direct residual waste.

Research Questions

Which pathway delivers greater climate benefit per tonne of residual MSW in the UK context: EfW with CCS or waste-derived SAF?

How sensitive are the comparative outcomes to key system parameters and assumptions (e.g. biogenic carbon content)?

What could implications be for UK policy in terms of waste allocation, climate strategy, and alignment with the waste hierarchy?

Methodology

To address these questions, TWICS utilises the ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards for LCA. The methodology is designed to isolate the net climate implications of diverting waste to either pathway, accounting for both direct and system-level impacts. The study follows the principles and requirements set out in ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, adopting a cradle-to-gate consequential life cycle assessment (LCA) framework to compare two alternative uses of MSW in the UK:

EfW with CCS

SAF production via a waste-to-ethanol-to-jet pathway (MSW-to-EtOH-to-SAF)

A consequential LCA approach is necessary to estimate the environmental effects of diverting residual waste to energy-from-waste with CCS versus SAF production and model systemic changes and capturing knock-on impacts across systems such as avoided emissions.

Key Results

Conclusion

A consequential life cycle assessment framework shows that both waste pathways deliver net-negative greenhouse gas emissions but differ substantially in the structure, durability, and sensitivity of their mitigation benefits.

EfW with CCS emerges as the stronger performer in absolute terms, delivering up to −1215 kg CO2-eq. per tonne MSW with avoided landfill credited, and remaining net-negative (−610 kg CO2-eq.) even under conservative assumptions excluding all avoided burden credits. Its climate benefit is dominated by permanent carbon dioxide removal from the biogenic fraction of waste. By contrast, the SAF pathway’s benefit is distributed across material and energy displacement, and is inherently more sensitive to system expansion assumptions and upstream burdens.

The TWICS framework highlights the importance of evaluating waste valorisation with careful consideration of climate potential. A coordinated approach is needed for residual MSW, as a strategic climate resource. This approach must evaluate allocation based on system-wide mitigation effectiveness and the permanence of climate benefit.",https://ukccsrc.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cropped-ukccsrc-icon-min-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-21 06:57:11.489797

A panel of top business aviation executives agreed that the industry’s current success and future growth will require visionaries who have an unwavering focus on the customer and appreciate the strength of professional peer networks.

That was the key message from NBAA’s Nov. 19 Thought Leadership webinar, “Pioneers of Progress — Lessons from Aviation’s Top Leaders, sponsored by NBAA Leadership Council Member, Mesinger Jet Sales.

“Success happens when you prioritize your customers,” said Michael Amalfitano, president and CEO of Embraer Executive Jets. “All of the businesses out there, you have to reflect on what you prioritize for your customer and provide a very clear vision of who you are.

“Your shareholders, your employees, need to be aligned with that culture, and if you stay true and authentic to that vision, customers will see that in your brand,” Amalfitano added.

That customer-centric approach is core to Duncan Aviation’s decades of success, noted company Chair Todd Duncan. “That’s how Duncan Aviation was founded. We built a culture and brand to deliver quality service to our customers, and that’s how we continue to thrive today.”

Tomorrow’s leaders can be inventive with how they approach this customer focus, said Avfuel President and CEO Craig Sincock, who over the past four decades has built a team of four people into a global company.

“In our early days, we figured out that we’re really not just in the fuel business, we were in the customer business,” he said. “We started looking at the things that surrounded fuel supply, like trucks, storage tanks, credit and credit card processing, insurance and we worked to surround the fuel transaction with a lot of other things that would help the customers in their business,

“That’s how we succeeded,” he added, noting, “if you’re always focusing on the customer, the business will follow.”

Emily Deaton, CEO of jetAVIA, echoed the importance of customer focus. “Leadership is about putting the customer at the center of everything you do and building up your team and committing to the brand,” she said.

But the panelists agreed that customer focus alone is not enough for future leaders to prosper. The strength of professional peer networks and industry associations is equally vital. Sincock noted that “to move ahead in this industry, you have to understand the industry, and that means learning from your peers,”

“You should also continually invest in yourself, go back to school, if needed, and remember that industry associations are a really powerful tool to connect with other industry leaders,” Duncan added.

Future leaders should also take time to consider the concept of leadership, the panelists agreed, with Amalfitano stressing that leadership “is not about one single moment; it’s about the choices you make.”

For Deaton, great leaders see their role holistically. “You have to understand what leadership isn’t,” she noted. “Sometimes, people have a misperception of leadership as just being in charge, or just building people up and celebrating them, and while those are important aspects, leadership is so much more,” she said.

Deaton added: “It’s about impact, intentional decision making, sacrifice, commitment to vision, putting the customer in the center of everything you do, building up your team and committing to the brand.”",https://nbaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MTA-Aviation-Hawker-Beechcraft-400XP-jet-rew-ramp.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 13:56:33.848609

Discomfort vs. conflict: They’re not the same Learning to tolerate discomfort doesn’t mean seeking out conflict; it means learning to manage it effectively.
Let me review my current workload and see how we can make this work.” You’re not creating conflict.
Breaking the imposter syndrome connection Here’s something crucial: when you’re constantly people-pleasing, you’re not showing up authentically.
Every time you choose discomfort over abandoning yourself, you’re building the muscle to show up as your authentic self.","If you’re a person with a chronic people-pleasing habit, you’ve probably heard all the standard advice: “Just be more assertive.” “Set better boundaries.” “Learn to say no.” And honestly? That advice has always felt incomplete to me and the thousands of clients I’ve helped over the last two decades.

Here’s what I’ve learned through my own journey and as a Master Certified Coach: you don’t need to become a jerk to stop people-pleasing at work. You just need to get better at tolerating the kind of discomfort that comes when you stop trying to manage everyone else’s emotions. Ooof….

Picture this: It’s Monday morning. You’re juggling three major projects when your colleague Sarah stops by. “Hey, I know you’re swamped, but could you help me with this presentation? You’re so good at this stuff.”

In that moment, your nervous system is scanning for threat: “What if Sarah thinks I’m not a team player? What if this affects my reputation? My raise?” Before you even process these thoughts consciously, you hear yourself saying, “Of course! I can squeeze it in tonight.”

Sound familiar?

What’s really happening when you people-please

Let’s be honest about what’s going on. Most people-pleasing at work isn’t about genuine generosity. It’s nervous system appeasement — habitual attempts to self-soothe by avoiding other people’s disappointment. This survival strategy once made sense, but now it’s exhausting you.

When you say yes to the fifth project outside your job description, when you smile through being interrupted, when you take the 7 a.m. call even though daycare doesn’t open until 7:15, it feels like you’re being collaborative. But what you’re really doing is outsourcing your self-worth to how others perceive you.

I used to be the queen of workplace people-pleasing. I’d stay late helping colleagues, take notes in every meeting even when it wasn’t my job and volunteer for committees nobody wanted. I told myself I was being helpful, building relationships. But the truth? I was terrified of being seen as difficult, excluded from the inner circle or being the one people complained about.

The psychological roots run deep. Many of us, especially women, were trained to equate being liked with being safe. “Be nice.” “Don’t rock the boat.” “Good girls don’t cause trouble.” These weren’t just social niceties – they were survival instructions. And they follow us into conference rooms and performance reviews.

The career cost of people-pleasing

Take my client Caroline, a marketing director who felt stuck despite being incredibly talented. She was constantly overwhelmed, working nights and weekends, but never getting recognition. Caroline had become the unofficial Office Mom — the one people came to for help, coverage, a sympathetic ear.

But here’s the problem: being indispensable in the wrong ways can make you invisible in the right ways. While Caroline managed everyone else’s workload and emotions, her strategic contributions got lost. She was so focused on being helpful that she wasn’t being strategic about her career.

Sometimes being too helpful signals that you’re support staff, not leadership material.

The real solution: Building discomfort tolerance

Here’s the shift I want you to make: instead of focusing on being less “nice,” focus on building your tolerance for the internal discomfort that comes when you’re not universally likable.

The reason you say yes when you want to say no isn’t because you’re too nice; it’s because you’re too polite. It’s because the discomfort of potentially disappointing someone feels unbearable. The thought of someone thinking you’re selfish triggers your nervous system’s alarm bells.

The work isn’t about becoming mean. It’s about learning to tolerate that discomfort without immediately moving to fix it.

Start here: One simple phrase

The next time someone asks you to take on something misaligned with your priorities, practice saying: “Let me think about that and get back to you.”

That’s it. You don’t need to explain why. Just buy yourself space and time.

Then breathe through the discomfort that bubbles up. Your nervous system will sound alarms, telling you you’re being rude. But that discomfort isn’t a sign you’ve done something wrong — it’s a sign you’re no longer abandoning yourself.

Build this tolerance by:

Starting small with low-stakes situations

Noticing physical sensations when the urge to people-please hits

Practicing self-compassion as you rewire decades-old patterns

Connecting with your “why” — what becomes possible when you stop managing everyone else’s emotions?

Discomfort vs. conflict: They’re not the same

Learning to tolerate discomfort doesn’t mean seeking out conflict; it means learning to manage it effectively. Conflict is external — a disagreement between people. Discomfort is internal — the feeling when you’re worried about others’ perceptions.

You can avoid unnecessary conflict while still tolerating the discomfort of not being universally liked. In fact, willingness to sit with discomfort often prevents conflict because you’re not building resentment from constantly sacrificing your needs.

When your boss asks you to take on another project but you’re at capacity, instead of immediately saying yes (and resenting it later), try: “I want to give this the attention it deserves. Let me review my current workload and see how we can make this work.”

You’re not creating conflict. You’re being professional about your capacity.

The transformation is real

I had another client, Jennifer, a project manager burning out from 60-hour weeks. She was terrified to say no, thinking it would damage her reputation. We worked on helping her tolerate the discomfort of not being the “yes” person.

Initially, she’d lie awake worrying about what people thought. But slowly, something shifted. When she said no to misaligned requests, she had more energy for projects that mattered. Her work quality improved. She contributed more strategically, rather than just agreeing with everything.

Her reputation actually improved. People saw her as more thoughtful and leadership-ready.

From compulsive to chosen

There’s a difference between helping because you genuinely want to contribute and helping because you’re afraid of what happens if you don’t. When you help from choice rather than compulsion, your contributions are more valuable.

Ask yourself:

Am I helping because I want to contribute, or because I’m afraid of not doing so?

Is this sustainable for me?

Am I helping from my strengths, or just doing whatever needs to be done?

Do I have boundaries around my helping?

Breaking the imposter syndrome connection

Here’s something crucial: when you’re constantly people-pleasing, you’re not showing up authentically. You’re showing up as the version you think others want to see. And when you’re not being authentic, it’s easy to feel like a fraud.

If you’re always saying yes when you want to say no, or always agreeing when you have different opinions, people never get to see who you really are. And if they don’t know the real you, how can you trust that they actually value you?

Breaking this cycle requires tolerating the discomfort of being seen as you really are, flaws and all. The people who matter will like the real you. The people who don’t weren’t really your people anyway.

Your discomfort isn’t a sign you’re doing something wrong. It’s a sign you’re growing, stepping outside your comfort zone, choosing courage over comfort.

What’s one small step you can take this week to practice tolerating discomfort instead of immediately people-pleasing? Start with low-stakes situations, but start somewhere.

Remember: you’re not responsible for managing other people’s emotions or making everyone comfortable. You’re only responsible for showing up authentically and treating people with respect.

Every time you choose discomfort over abandoning yourself, you’re building the muscle to show up as your authentic self. And that’s not just good for you — it’s good for everyone around you, because authenticity gives others permission to do the same.

You’re worthy of love and acceptance exactly as you are.

Sean Doyle, British Airways’ Chairman and CEO","We’re on a journey to a better BA and it’s something everyone here is committed to.

I can’t pretend that running an airline over the last few years has been without turbulence. We’ve had to dig deep to withstand the impact of the global pandemic which almost shut us down completely. Since then, our focus has been on rebuilding - putting in place solid foundations and embedding a mindset of continuous improvement. We’ve come a long way and we’ve achieved great results, but we know we have further to go.

For our teams, 2026 is about continuing to transform and innovate - unlocking the full benefits of the changes we’re making; taking everything we’ve built so far and raising the bar even higher. One of our mottos now is ‘Find it, Fix it’.

Our £7bn investment plan supports our ambition. We’ve already delivered more than 1,000 improvement projects, spanning every corner of the airline. From upgrading aircraft cabins and lounges to overhauling our operations and digital systems, the results are visible in how we’re delivering a better BA for everyone who flies with us, works with us and invests in us. The progress we’ve made means our business is now stronger, more resilient and better equipped to handle the challenges that come with running a global airline.

Transforming our operation

The foundations of a better BA enable us to be a resilient, punctual and safe operation - underpinned by high standards and technical reliability. Alongside the introduction of our Heathrow operating model, our £100m investment in technology has helped us make incredible progress in improving our on-time performance; something our customers fully deserve. The summer of 2025 was one of our most successful on record for punctuality. We’re all boosted by this achievement, and we’ll continue to build on this. We’re changing our operation for the better as we continue to modernise our systems with new technology, AI, machine learning and automation. We’ve updated and simplified a number of our most critical systems, making us more resilient and when unexpected issues occur, we recover much more quickly.

We’ve been laser-focused on improving the reliability of our aircraft to reduce delays and cancellations. The use of AI in our operation is helping deliver a significant improvement in our ability to recover from periods of weather and air traffic disruption. The technology has helped us deliver a 10% decrease in aircraft turnaround times and an estimated 10-15% reduction in cancellations on days where we have restrictions on the number of our aircraft that can take off and land at Heathrow.

We’re regularly welcoming new deliveries of modern, fuel-efficient planes into our fleet of 280+ aircraft. We’ve also grown our electric vehicle fleet as part of our airport operations and made one of the largest investments into ground service equipment in the UK to enhance the customer journey and support our sustainability goals. We’ve introduced 15 hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) powered buses, offering improved comfort and reduced emissions and supporting our BA Better World initiatives. We continue to invest in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)* and we recently celebrated four years of our BA Better World programme, with our colleagues driving the change we need to see. Thanks to the generosity of our people and customers, the BA Better World Community Fund has raised more than £8 million, supporting more than 200 UK-based charities and social enterprises - a truly remarkable achievement.

Transforming our customer experience

We’re focused on elevating the customer experience both on the ground and in the air to meet customers’ expectations, offering greater choice and competitive value. This includes our plans to introduce free, lightning-fast Starlink Wi-Fi on our aircraft from 2026 onwards. In the digital space, we’re launching a new ba.com and app to offer our customers a seamless and reliable user experience that makes travel simpler and more enjoyable.

We’re investing in our lounges and recently unveiled our bold new design concept with brand new openings in Miami and Dubai. We also completed lounge refreshes in London Gatwick, Lagos, Singapore, Seattle, and Washington Dulles.

We’re also introducing our new First seat as part of our A380 retrofit programme next year, continuing the rollout of our Club Suite (business class) and new short-haul cabins. We’re equipping our Customer Care team with new technology and connectivity to deliver a premium experience at 35,000ft, offering support for when things don’t go to plan. We’re in touch with our customers now more than ever before and have been improving our communications to offer a more seamless experience. Our Customer Relations team is rolling out WhatsApp messaging to a wider customer base following successful trials, and we’re increasing our live chat functionality to offer quicker in-the-moment solutions. Plus, we’re now offering digital vouchers at Heathrow during periods of disruption to allow customers to book hotels and buy food and drinks with greater ease.

Transforming our business

Our purpose remains to connect Britain with the world and the world with Britain, and we’ll continue to grow our network and ensure we’re competitive, while focusing on doing this sustainably. In 2026 we’re adding a further direct route between London and North America - taking the number of destinations we fly to directly in the US to 27, as we add St. Louis to our roster. In the competitive short-haul market we’ll focus on making sure we’re efficient and our costs are sustainable.

It’s important that BA is an organisation that our people are proud to work for, and I want to pay tribute to their hard work and dedication, which I see day in, day out when I’m out and about.

Our people are our biggest asset and are at the heart of our transformation. They’re crucial to our success as an organisation, and we’ll continue to enhance their experience, while embedding a change mindset and delivering a high-performance culture. This will be underpinned by strong leadership, collaboration, modern workspaces and tools. In everything we all do, every single one of us are guided by our corporate values:

Excellence – striving for world-class standards in everything we do

Caring – showing warmth, respect and genuine pride in representing BA

Open-Minded – being curious, bold and ready to embrace new ideas.

Change takes time, but I’m encouraged by the results we’re seeing and our efforts to step up the execution of all our transformation projects.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA), Japan, and Malaysia are calling for a single, strengthened global system to regulate aviation emissions and support coordinated climate action toward net-zero by 2050.

In a joint statement on Nov. 18 at COP30, the coalition urged governments to strengthen the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) leadership and ensure its role as the sole authority on international aviation emissions. They cautioned that fragmented or unilateral climate measures would undermine progress, stressing that a unified framework and integrated carbon market are critical for effective decarbonization.

CORSIA as the primary aviation climate tool

IATA and its allies argue that the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) should serve as the main global compliance mechanism for aviation emissions. They say the scheme enables a unified carbon market, mobilizes investment in low-carbon development, and fosters trust through a standardized system of monitoring, reporting, and verification.

Adopted by all 193 ICAO Member States in 2016, CORSIA requires airlines to offset emissions from international flights that exceed 2019 levels using approved carbon credits. According to the coalition, the scheme is projected to cover at least 85% of international aviation emissions by 2027 and generate more than USD 120 billion in climate finance between 2024 and 2035.

The group also emphasizes that CORSIA enables developing countries to access international carbon markets and attract investment, benefits they say unilateral taxation cannot deliver.

Key challenges in CORSIA implementation and market readiness

Despite its potential, CORSIA’s implementation faces significant challenges. The coalition is calling on host countries to operationalize Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, issue Letters of Authorization (LoAs) for CORSIA compliance, and enable the release of CORSIA-eligible Emission Units (EEUs).

An LoA is a formal document issued by a host country that authorizes a specific carbon project to generate credits for international offsetting under CORSIA. Without this approval, project developers cannot supply CORSIA-compliant credits. However, the process is often slowed by bureaucratic delays, contributing to uncertainty in the market.

In addition to LoAs, host countries must also provide “corresponding adjustments” to their national emissions inventories. This ensures that emission reductions are not double-counted, once by the host country and again by the airline using the credits.

As of June 2025, only 15.84 million CORSIA-eligible credits have been issued, all from Guyana’s jurisdictional REDD+ program. In October, Japan’s two largest airlines became the first carriers to cancel a batch of these credits, marking a milestone for CORSIA-compliant transactions.

While over 4,000 projects across ICAO-approved registries could technically supply eligible credits, carbon market ratings agency Sylvera estimates that only around 1,500 projects are located in the 16 countries that show moderate readiness to issue Article 6 authorizations.

In a recent Sylvera survey, more than 40 policy and market experts identified “volume of credits with authorizations and corresponding adjustments” as the top concern for CORSIA’s future. A combined 59% of respondents ranked it as either the most important or second-most important uncertainty facing the scheme.

Effectiveness of ticket taxes questioned

Alongside its support for CORSIA, the coalition pushed back against growing interest in ticket taxes and similar levies, arguing that such measures are ineffective climate solutions. They say these taxes increase travel costs for passengers while diverting funds away from impactful decarbonization investments.

IATA specifically criticized the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force (GSLTF), calling it a “misguided” initiative. Formed by eight countries and supported by the European Union, the GSLTF proposes levies on First and Business Class tickets and private jet operations. The goal is to increase aviation’s financial contribution to climate mitigation, particularly in support of developing countries.

The task force cites a study by Netherlands-based consultancy CE Delft, which estimates such levies could generate up to USD 90 billion annually. IATA dismissed the figure as unrealistic, pointing out that it is nearly three times the airline industry’s projected global profit of USD 32.4 billion in 2024. The association also warned that imposing taxes on premium travelers could disrupt route economics and weaken air connectivity.

“Fragmented taxes and levies will not cut emissions. They risk diverting funds from actual emission-reduction investments, which is a critical climate consideration, and will only weaken connectivity and harm those who depend on it most,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. He urged governments to focus on fully implementing CORSIA instead of pursuing overlapping measures.

Still, some governments are moving ahead with national and regional aviation climate policies. Singapore will become the first country to introduce a green fuel levy on passengers starting in 2026. The levy is based on the volume of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) required to meet its 1% SAF target, as well as the projected price premium and other associated costs. In the European Union, the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative mandates SAF blending and applies carbon pricing.

Luke Mace, senior vice president, freight forwarding / project logistics, GEODIS

One of the main challenges lies in finding a balance between growth ambitions and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. There is a clear imbalance between transit times and cost efficiency versus customer expectations.

If we look at short-term and impactful actions, it’s about using the most efficient solutions available today, such as prioritizing sea or rail transport over air whenever possible, selecting the most energy-efficient aircraft or vessels (for example through GEODIS AirSmart), increasing the use of available low-carbon fuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), sustainable marine fuel (SMF) or hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), which can reduce GHG emissions by up to 80%, and ensuring space utilization so we don’t ship empty space.

GEODIS AirSmart is a great illustration. The company has recently launched this new low-carbon airfreight solution, designed to significantly reduce GHG emissions by optimizing aircraft performance and routing. By selecting the most energy-efficient aircraft and leveraging external flight data and advanced analytics, GEODIS AirSmart enables smarter routing decisions and enhances performance.

This innovation represents a major step forward in GEODIS’s journey toward decarbonization and supports customers in achieving their climate goals. With GEODIS AirSmart we can achieve up to 40% reduction in GHG emission per shipment.

Roger Strevens, director, low carbon regulation and advocacy, Methanex

In mid-October, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) held a meeting to consider the adoption of the Net Zero Framework (NZF), the regulatory package that is intended to deliver on the goals of its 2023 GHG strategy, which was unanimously supported by member states. The NZF had been approved, the first step in the regulatory process, by a large majority back in April at Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) 83.

However, due to widely reported pressure from the U.S., many member states changed their positions. The outcome was that a vote was called to adjourn the adoption meeting by a year, and it was carried 57-49.

While adjournment of the adoption meeting was disappointing to many, it is important to note the NZF has not been rejected, rather member states are not in a position to adopt it yet. Critically, there is now time to develop the NZF to a point where there is consensus for adoption.

It is important for the IMO not to lose momentum. Work continues on the supporting guidelines, and the IMO Secretariat will consult closely with member states to determine the best path forward. The consistent support from global shipping organizations highlights the industry’s readiness to advance sustainability and clean fuels. A unified global approach for a global industry is economically and environmentally preferable to fragmented regulations that are separated by national and regional borders.

For breakbulk shipping companies, the NZF deferral may temporarily pause decisions around retrofitting or ordering vessels for alternative fuels, but it also offers a window to monitor developments like the upcoming review of FuelEU Maritime. Given the long-term nature of fleet investments, it remains prudent to anticipate the growing prominence of decarbonization regulations.

In this context, methanol stands out as a compelling option for breakbulk vessels due to its favorable overall cost, lower complexity and minimal impact on cargo space. It is compatible with tramp operations due to the relatively low cost of port infrastructure needed, making it an attractive choice. Methanex is committed to supporting shipping companies as they navigate these decisions.

In summary, given that the shipping industry wants to progress and leading clean fuel producers are poised to deliver, the pace of political alignment will be crucial for future progress.

XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF"") (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (""SAF""), today commented on the expanding policy momentum supporting SAF adoption across the United States.

Momentum is building fast. Under the U.S. SAF Grand Challenge, federal targets call for 3 billion gallons of annual production by 2030 - scaling to 35 billion gallons by 2050 to meet 100% of domestic demand. Today, production remains below 1% of U.S. jet fuel use, underscoring both the urgency and the scale of the opportunity.

The U.S. SAF market is expected to grow more than seven-fold - from approximately $860 million in 2024 to nearly $7 billion by 2030 - representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~47%. Globally, the SAF market is projected to exceed $25 billion, with worldwide demand surpassing 5.5 billion gallons over the same period.

At the state level, momentum is accelerating in parallel. California, Oregon, Washington, and New Mexico have adopted low-carbon fuel standards that include SAF, and five additional states are advancing similar frameworks. Collectively, these states represent nearly 40% of total U.S. jet fuel consumption, creating a rapidly expanding incentive landscape for SAF deployment.

""Policy momentum is transforming aspiration into execution,"" said Chris Cooper, CEO of XCF Global. ""The U.S. is making it clear that sustainable aviation fuel is essential to the future of aviation. With supportive federal and state frameworks, airlines and energy companies can move beyond pilot programs and commit to long-term, scalable decarbonization strategies. At XCF, we're building one of America's leading SAF platforms - designed to scale production, strengthen domestic supply chains, and meet the growing demand for home-grown, low-carbon fuels.""

From inception, approximately $350 million has been invested in XCF's flagship New Rise Reno facility. The company is advancing a project pipeline of three additional sites. The second facility, New Rise Reno 2, located adjacent to the existing site, will share utilities and logistics infrastructure to maximize efficiencies. XCF expects construction to begin in 2026 and operations from 2028, following an additional $300 million investment that is expected to double production capacity to ~80 million gallons per year.

As global demand accelerates, the U.S. has an opportunity to not only meet its own decarbonization goals but also to become a leading exporter of low-carbon fuels. Expanding domestic SAF production supports the Make More in America Initiative, creates high-tech, clean-energy jobs, and strengthens the nation's competitiveness in the global energy transition.

""America's aviation industry has always thrived on innovation,"" Cooper continued. ""With clear policy alignment and accelerating demand, the U.S. has a generational opportunity to lead the world in sustainable aviation. XCF is committed to turning that opportunity into action - transforming today's policy commitments into tomorrow's progress.""

11/20/2025 - 10:42 AM

Policy Momentum: Federal and state policy alignment is accelerating nationwide SAF adoption

Market Opportunity: U.S. SAF market projected at $7 billion by 2030, with a $25 billion global opportunity

Strategic Investment: $350 million invested in the New Rise Reno facility, advancing America's push to decarbonize aviation

XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF"") (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (""SAF""), today commented on the expanding policy momentum supporting SAF adoption across the United States.

Momentum is building fast. Under the U.S. SAF Grand Challenge, federal targets call for 3 billion gallons of annual production by 2030 - scaling to 35 billion gallons by 2050 to meet 100% of domestic demand. Today, production remains below 1% of U.S. jet fuel use, underscoring both the urgency and the scale of the opportunity.

The U.S. SAF market is expected to grow more than seven-fold - from approximately $860 million in 2024 to nearly $7 billion by 2030 - representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~47%. Globally, the SAF market is projected to exceed $25 billion, with worldwide demand surpassing 5.5 billion gallons over the same period.

At the state level, momentum is accelerating in parallel. California, Oregon, Washington, and New Mexico have adopted low-carbon fuel standards that include SAF, and five additional states are advancing similar frameworks. Collectively, these states represent nearly 40% of total U.S. jet fuel consumption, creating a rapidly expanding incentive landscape for SAF deployment.

""Policy momentum is transforming aspiration into execution,"" said Chris Cooper, CEO of XCF Global. ""The U.S. is making it clear that sustainable aviation fuel is essential to the future of aviation. With supportive federal and state frameworks, airlines and energy companies can move beyond pilot programs and commit to long-term, scalable decarbonization strategies. At XCF, we're building one of America's leading SAF platforms - designed to scale production, strengthen domestic supply chains, and meet the growing demand for home-grown, low-carbon fuels.""

From inception, approximately $350 million has been invested in XCF's flagship New Rise Reno facility. The company is advancing a project pipeline of three additional sites. The second facility, New Rise Reno 2, located adjacent to the existing site, will share utilities and logistics infrastructure to maximize efficiencies. XCF expects construction to begin in 2026 and operations from 2028, following an additional $300 million investment that is expected to double production capacity to ~80 million gallons per year.

As global demand accelerates, the U.S. has an opportunity to not only meet its own decarbonization goals but also to become a leading exporter of low-carbon fuels. Expanding domestic SAF production supports the Make More in America Initiative, creates high-tech, clean-energy jobs, and strengthens the nation's competitiveness in the global energy transition.

""America's aviation industry has always thrived on innovation,"" Cooper continued. ""With clear policy alignment and accelerating demand, the U.S. has a generational opportunity to lead the world in sustainable aviation. XCF is committed to turning that opportunity into action - transforming today's policy commitments into tomorrow's progress.""

Argus, an energy and commodity market intelligence firm, has launched the aviation industry’s first calculated price indexes for electrolytic sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF). It shows the current cost of eSAF is thirteen times that of fossil-based jet fuel.

The firm aims to address the urgent need of aviation fuel suppliers, airlines, and policymakers for clear pricing as they work toward meeting industry mandates.

In a brief on the new price index, Argus notes that while Europe and the UK are advancing toward more stringent SAF requirements, there is a widening disconnect between policy ambition, cost realities and investment delays.

Argus eSAF indexes show the scale of the challenge

Argus’ newly launched weekly indexes calculate the production cost of eSAF in the Amsterdam–Rotterdam–Antwerp (ARA) region, in both €/t and $/t, and are published both including and excluding capital expenditure.

The November 2025 cost assessment shows eSAF is currently:

13× the cost of fossil jet fuel

3.5× the cost of HEFA-SPK bio-SAF

This structural price gap will persist, Argus argues, as long as hydrocarbon jet fuel prices fail to reflect their environmental cost. Governments will need to provide long-term policy support to bridge it.

SAF is the only near-term path to reducing aviation emissions

Since electric propulsion or hydrogen aircraft will require a decade or more of engine redesign and infrastructure overhaul, SAF remains the only saleable option today capable of reducing aviation emissions without modifying existing aircraft or airport systems.

Europe and the UK began their SAF mandates this year with an initial 2% requirement, ramping sharply through 2035 as part of their net-zero roadmap.

European Union – ReFuelEU Aviation

Starting at 2% SAF of the total jet-fuel supply in 2025.

Rising to 6% by 2030.

Then to 20% by 2035.

Long-term target: 70% by 2050.

There is also a sub-mandate for synthetic (PtL/eSAF) fuels: starting at 0.7% in 2030 and increasing to 35% by 2050.

United Kingdom – SAF Mandate

Mandatory SAF share begins in 2025 at 2% of total UK jet-fuel demand.

Increases to 10% by 2030.

Reaches 22% by 2040.

Additional UK sub-target for PtL SAF starting at 0.2% by 2028 and reaching up to 3.5% by 2040.

Read more: Which European airlines use the most SAF?

Airlines are not optimistic about finding an adequate, affordable SAF supply

Under pressure, the airline industry is questioning the viability of SAF mandates.

Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary has been openly sceptical. As reported by the BBC this August, he said there is “not a hope in hell” of the UK’s 10% SAF mandate being met by 2030. O’Leary also said that Ryanair would not increase its SAF use because supply “is not there,” and described SAF as “nonsense.”

IATA argues that governments must support the development of technology that would stabilise SAF supply and make it more affordable. Ahead of this year’s ICAO Assembly, IATA Director General Willie Walsh said SAF was “absolutely critical” for airlines to meet their net zero targets by 2050.

“We’re disappointed at the progress made in relation to production. It’s not where we need it to be,” he said. “The problem, as we see it, is one of supply and not one of demand.”

Policymakers, however, are holding to their targets, requiring aviation to decarbonise alongside other transport modes, while failing to address the production gap.

Argus sees SAF oversupply today, and a crisis by 2030

Argus forecasts a global oversupply of SAF until around 2030, when EU mandates become far more stringent and penalties begin to bite.

Conventional jet fuel suppliers face billions of dollars in potential fines if they fail to meet SAF quotas. At the same time, airlines must refuel with SAF-blended jet fuel at major EU airports or absorb penalties for tankering fuel from elsewhere.

Current SAF pricing discourages greater adoption. In northwest Europe, SAF prices recently surged to a two-year high—nearly $3,000 per tonne, more than 3.5 times the cost of conventional jet fuel—despite the overall oversupply.

Argus attributes this temporary tightening to factors such as plant maintenance and weak imports. Yet even as prices rise, major producers, including BP and Shell, have delayed or cancelled SAF projects, citing economic and policy uncertainty.

Argus says there is growing awareness that bio-SAF alone cannot decarbonise aviation. Feedstocks such as used cooking oil—on which HEFA production depends—are finite and structurally insufficient for the scale of demand.

eSAF mandates loom, but industry is unprepared

Hydrogen-derived eSAF will become mandatory in the EU from 2030, but Argus believes the supply chain is nowhere near ready to deliver.

To meet quotas, the region will require roughly 600,000 tonnes of eSAF annually, equivalent to about 12 commercial-scale plants. Yet of the 70 proposed UK and EU eSAF projects tracked by Argus, not a single one has reached a final investment decision (FID).

Plant construction takes three to four years, meaning FIDs must be taken within the next year for Europe to have any chance of meeting 2030 obligations. The risk of non-compliance will have serious financial consequences.

If no eSAF is available in 2030, penalties for EU fuel suppliers could total $5–10 billion, and obligations roll forward annually. According to Argus, the ongoing debate over whether the EU would enforce such penalties has further dampened investor confidence.

A SAF Catch-22 is blocking investment

Argus believes a fundamental misalignment between supply and demand hampers the financing of eSAF projects. Long-term offtake agreements are necessary to secure funding for these projects.

However, airlines, which typically operate with tight margins and favour short-term fuel contracts, are hesitant to commit tens of millions of dollars upfront for a fuel whose price might decrease as the technology evolves. This conflict is the primary factor stalling investment across the e-SAF sector.

“Long-term eSAF offtake agreements are essential to the financing of production facilities,” said Argus Media chairman and chief executive Adrian Binks. “But buyers are wary of committing tens of millions of dollars to such agreements, creating a disconnect between supply obligations and demand that has stalled investment.

“Our new modelled costs will provide important independent transparency upon which participants across the e-SAF value chain can rely to inform their long-term decision making.”

The new eSAF indexes add to Argus’ established SAF benchmarks in Northwest Europe, Asia-Pacific and the US, leveraging the organisation’s pricing and consultancy depth across biofuels, natural gas and hydrogen.

With mandates accelerating, penalties looming and investment lagging, the industry faces a narrowing window to align supply capacity with regulatory expectations. Argus expects its data will give airlines, refiners, and policymakers a clearer view of the fundamental economics of eSAF—precisely when informed decision-making is most urgent.

The new MoU with ENOC shifts the focus to Dubai, aiming to make SAF supply within the emirate both commercially and operationally viable.","Dubai: Emirates and ENOC Group have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to explore supplying Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) at scale to Emirates at its Dubai hub. The agreement, signed during the Dubai Airshow, brings together the UAE’s largest airline and its main fuel supplier at a time when global aviation is under pressure to cut emissions and secure long-term access to cleaner fuels, reports Gulf News.

Under the MoU, both sides will conduct feasibility studies to determine what is required to build a dependable SAF supply chain in Dubai. The studies will look at supply infrastructure, the possibility of local production, blending needs, and the commercial factors necessary to ensure long-term sustainability. A joint steering committee will oversee the process, reflecting a coordinated effort between two major players in the UAE aviation sector.

SAF is a certified drop-in fuel that works with existing aircraft and current airport systems. It can be blended with regular jet fuel by up to 50 percent, and in its unblended form, it can reduce lifecycle emissions by as much as 80 percent. This makes it one of the most practical short-term tools available to aviation as broader decarbonisation technologies continue to evolve.

Emirates has already been involved in SAF-related work in the UAE, contributing to the General Policy for Sustainable Aviation Fuel and taking part in committees examining biofuels, hydrogen, and future aviation fuels. The policy aims to make the UAE a regional hub for cleaner fuels, with a target of producing 700 million litres of SAF annually by 2030.

The airline has carried out several SAF demonstration flights to test operational readiness. In January 2023, it operated a Boeing 777 flight using 100 percent SAF in one engine. In November 2023, it followed this with the first A380 demonstration flight using 100 percent SAF in one engine. That same month, Emirates also operated flights from Dubai International Airport using more than 315,000 gallons of blended SAF that was supplied directly through the airport’s fuel network.

During its 2024–25 financial year, Emirates obtained 7,519 tonnes of SAF at several international airports, including Amsterdam, London Heathrow, Oslo, Singapore, Paris, Lyon, and Nice.

The goal is to streamline processes across the industry to make CO2 emissions data visible and consistent for passengers at the time of booking their flights. The Flight Emissions Label stems from a regulation launched by the European Union in 2024, under the responsibility of EASA. This provides a trustworthy framework for airlines to share flight emissions data with passengers transparently. The EcoHub by IATA is a comprehensive system for airline sustainability data management, reporting, and compliance. Alongside this, IATA CO2 Connect collects airline operational data and calculates the CO2 performance of the flights, similar to the data required for the issuance of the Flight Emissions Label.

With this Memorandum of Understanding, EASA and IATA aim to explore participation in the Flight Emissions Label by aligning processes for label issuance use cases for airlines in a cost-effective way.

Florian Guillermet, Executive Director of EASA, said: “This partnership with IATA, the world’s largest airlines’ association, will make it easier for airlines to join the Flight Emissions Label. The more airlines we have on board, the better the overall information for air passengers, allowing them to make informed choices when they book their flights.”

Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA, said: “Regulatory compliance and customer demands for transparent emissions information must be met with the highest standards. Providing accurate emissions data is crucial for informed decision-making and for maintaining confidence in the sustainability of air transport. IATA’s EcoHub and our access to extensive sustainability data will give airlines an easier way to be part of the Flight Emissions Label, and confidence that the very best data will be utilized. Our collaboration with EASA will focus on enabling an efficient and harmonized exchange of data, reducing administrative burdens, and achieving long-term cost savings for all stakeholders.”

The signing took place at IATA’s Wings of Change Europe, on 18-19 November 2025, in Brussels.

Background Information

The Regulation that put the Flight Emissions Label (FEL) in place was adopted in December 2024 by the European Commission and aims to empower passengers with information on flight-related emissions, allowing them to make informed decisions when booking and comparing flights. The label will also increase accountability within the aviation sector by establishing a harmonized emissions calculation methodology, data reporting, and emissions display for all airlines in the European Union. Building on a fully digitalized process, FEL will also reduce the administrative burden for the sector.

The FEL provides a trustworthy framework for airlines to share flight emissions data with passengers. Airlines from both EU and non-EU countries, covered under the scope of Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 “ReFuelEU Aviation”, can voluntarily join the FEL. Only those airlines that have joined are allowed to display emissions to their passengers in the European Union, in accordance with Article 6(5) of the Regulation. The European Commission and EASA encourage airlines to join the FEL if they want to display flight emissions and use these estimates when, for example, offering sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) or other emissions offsets to passengers.

IATA EcoHub and CO2 Connect

IATA manages the EcoHub and IATA CO2 Connect, a carbon emissions calculator for both passenger and air cargo based on primary airline data collected from more than 90 airlines. The collaboration with EASA will explore how leveraging these tools can create efficiencies for synergies with the EU Flight Emissions Label, ensuring consistency and transparency across the industry. Airlines are continuously joining CO2 Connect, increasing its effectiveness and the quality of its data, with Kenya Airways the latest to sign up.

Residual waste is no longer just ‘trash’ in the UK – it is a strategic climate resource. This new OIES study shows why policymakers and industry leaders need to rethink where it goes. The paper compares two competing pathways: using waste in Energy-from-Waste plants with carbon capture (WECCS), which can deliver durable, net-negative emissions by capturing and permanently storing biogenic CO₂; and converting waste into Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which helps decarbonize a hard-to-abate sector by displacing fossil jet fuel. Both routes offer climate value, but not equally, and not simultaneously.

WECCS consistently delivers the larger climate payoff because it permanently removes carbon from the atmosphere, while SAF offers important but more modest benefits through fossil-fuel substitution and material recovery. With finite waste available, the UK risks policy incoherence if separate incentives push waste in opposite directions. The study advocates for treating waste as a climate asset.

“Asia Pacific is growing at a very fast pace. (The region’s) governments are determined to support this growth, because aviation plays a big part in their economies, I think we'll get there,” Menon said.

“(They) are working … with their airlines, fuel suppliers, manufacturers and airports to achieve that target. Most of these governments have got their (sustainable) fuel suppliers on the ready.”

GOVERNMENTS STEP UP ON SUSTAINABILITY

Menon noted that an increasing number of governments in the region are introducing policies and regulations aimed at supporting the industry’s sustainability targets.

They include encouraging the adoption of cleaner jet fuels to promoting technological innovation and collaboration among sectors.

Singapore, for example, implemented an SAF levy last week. Airline passengers departing from Singapore will have to pay duties ranging from S$1 (US$0.77) to S$41.60 per ticket, depending on their travel destination and travel class.

Singapore also aims for SAF to account for 1 per cent of all jet fuel next year, rising to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.

Menon said there is a need for governments to enforce policies and regulations to accelerate SAF production and adoption because high costs, limited infrastructure and market uncertainty make it difficult for the private sector to scale up on its own.

“It’s very important for governments to be proactive. Most people would say yes … to addressing emissions, but what people say and what people do sometimes differ,” he said.

“Unless there is a trigger, a call to action, people don't really act. (Singapore’s SAF) levy is (that) call to action and gives people an opportunity to participate in the greening of the planet.”

Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s most populous country, is considering a regulation to require international flights from Jakarta and Bali use a 1 per cent SAF blend from next year, gradually increasing to 5 per cent by 2035.

Malaysia is targeting a 47 per cent SAF blending mandate by 2050, and is looking to build domestic production, blending and supply of the fuel.

Japan has mandated that its refiners must supply SAF equivalent to 10 per cent of their aviation fuel sales by 2030.

EXTERNAL HEADWINDS & RESILIENT DEMAND

Most aviation experts agree that sustainable jet fuel is currently the most feasible path to greener skies as it can be used with existing aircraft and airport infrastructure.

Such fuel is made from renewable or waste-based materials instead of petroleum. It can come from biofuels derived from crops, waste-based sources like used cooking oil, or synthetic e-fuels made by combining captured carbon with hydrogen.

However, its availability remains severely limited – the commodity accounted for just 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production in 2024.

As such, Menon said advancing technology to enhance efficiency is also a crucial part of the industry’s roadmap towards net-zero emissions.

But while there have been significant gains in emissions reductions through technology, supply chain issues – including bottlenecks in aircraft, engine and component production and delivery – have slowed progress, he said.

Furthermore, tariffs – particularly those from United States President Donald Trump – are expected to spur inflation and undermine supply chain recovery, he added

Industry groups representing global aerospace companies have already warned that such duties could jeopardise air safety or trigger other unintended consequences.

“Chief among … troubling developments in the external environment … are tariffs, (which) can do a lot of damage. In spite of that, we expect that (air travel) demand will continue to grow,” Menon said.

What was once described as “revenge travel” – a buzzword coined in 2021 to capture the surge in pent-up demand for vacations after pandemic lockdowns – has now evolved into “resilient travel”, he said.

Each year since the pandemic has seen a steady rise in tourism numbers, reflecting the world’s enduring appetite for travel.

In 2024, there were 1.5 billion international arrivals globally, a 12 per cent increase from the previous year, according to the United Nations.

“Demand for air travel, both cargo and passenger, is very strong. Everybody wants to travel, whether it is for business or leisure,” Menon said.

“So, that is why you see Asia Pacific governments doing their best to support the industry's growth, even while trying to help them address the problems of sustainability.”","https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--IJ0szXXq--/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/one-cms/core/2025-06-30t133925z_1_lynxmpel5t0nn_rtroptp_3_emirates-aviation.jpg?itok=ie7M5mPe",N,,2025-11-20 05:56:30.239201

PA Consulting’s new report explores the barriers to scaling Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and how airports can lead the charge to decarbonise aviation.

Airports’ critical role in scaling SAF solutions

As aviation faces the challenge to decarbonise flight, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has emerged as the most immediate and scalable solution.

Yet despite SAF’s promise – cutting lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 70 percent compared to fossil-based jet fuel – progress remains patchy. Our research report, Cacophony to symphony: successfully scaling sustainable aviation fuel, identifies cost, misalignment, and fragmented action as the primary barriers to widespread adoption.

The research gathered views on SAF from close to 600 leaders globally across the SAF value chain, including 125 airport representatives. Across all respondents, the survey reveals strong belief in SAF’s potential:

92 percent of respondents say SAF is crucial to decarbonisation

78 percent believe it holds promise for job creation

Yet only 40 percent are optimistic about widespread SAF adoption by 2030.

Specifically, leaders from airports project SAF to rise from three percent of total aviation fuel today to seven percent by 2030 – this would be consistent with the level of the EU mandates but fall short of the UK’s 10 percent target. Even more discouragingly, two-thirds of the airports we surveyed lack a SAF strategy, and half have no net zero roadmap.

The more encouraging finding is that airports, as physical hubs and conveners of the aviation ecosystem, have a unique opportunity to lead the charge and orchestrate a whole-system response to scale SAF. So, how can airports reframe their role to help orchestrate SAF success?

Lay the foundations for policy success

To scale SAF, our research finds it’s vital that government policy actively encourages investment in, and creates confidence around, the SAF market – because a significant market shift requires market stimulation. Yet it’s also clear that key players can’t wait for government to act. Airport leaders can start driving progress in response to known conditions, and in parallel with ongoing policy developments.

In the face of wider federal uncertainty in the US, for instance, airports should be focusing on local action – partnering with state- and regional-level leaders to co-fund SAF infrastructure or offer tax incentives. These efforts lead by example and also create proof points that can shape higher-level policy. With the likes of San Francisco International Airport (SFO), we’re already seeing bold, state-based action shape the future of SAF in the US. Working with a coalition of 150 airlines, fuel providers, and other organisations, SFO successfully lobbied the California Air Resources Board to expand the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) to offer the opt-in inclusion of SAF. As a result, the LCFS offers a ~$1.25 per US gallon incentive for SAF over conventional fuel, levelling the playing field and making California ‘the world’s most competitive market for SAF’.

Beyond that, airports can start engaging with, and supporting as appropriate, national SAF policies such as the UK’s proposed revenue certainty mechanism. And by investing in SAF-compatible infrastructure, co-developing supply networks, and partnering across the value chain. Examples include Heathrow’s SAF incentive scheme and the Minnesota SAF Hub.

Act as the convenor for the SAF cost reduction mission

Our research found that cost is the single biggest barrier to SAF scale-up. SAF is projected to cost 115 percent more than conventional jet fuel by 2030.

Airports can help rebalance risk and reward by facilitating buyer coalitions, aggregating demand, and enabling longer, bankable offtake agreements. According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), 175 airports globally already offer or have offered , and this number is expected to grow as supply becomes a competitive differentiator.

Innovative procurement models – such as Book & Claim and Scope 3 attribute sales – allow airports, airlines, corporations, and others to support SAF production without physical delivery. Projects such as British Airways’ long-term contracts with Project Speedbird demonstrate how early adoption can yield cost advantages and market leadership.

Airports can act as conveners – bringing together airlines, fuel suppliers, corporates, and passengers. The aforementioned Minnesota SAF Hub, which supplies SAF to Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport, demonstrates the power of regional collaboration. Backed by Delta Air Lines, Bank of America, and the State of Minnesota, the hub aims to produce up to one billion US gallons of SAF annually, integrating feedstocks, refining, and pipeline delivery.

Future-proof with flexibility

With two-thirds of airport respondents to our survey saying they do not have a SAF strategy, and half with no net zero roadmap, inertia risks undermining public trust and investor confidence. Out of everyone in the SAF ecosystem, airports are closest to their communities and often bear the brunt of environmental scrutiny. As our report notes, “If airports aren’t seen to act, the court of public and government opinion may turn against them.”

With 75 percent of global travellers expressing a desire to travel more and 44 percent willing to pay more for SAF-powered flights, the pressure is mounting. Airports must demonstrate they are part of a regenerative future – not just by complying with mandates, but by leading the transition.

We’re seeing positive examples. The CEO of Massport, the operator of Boston Logan Airport (BOS), has set out a far-reaching plan to develop a New England SAF Hub. Yet more airports need to shift from hesitation to action. SAF-readiness assessments can identify low-cost infrastructure upgrades, depending on each airport’s unique attributes. These assessments also consider whether current models require open access legislation. At airports such as Hong Kong International Airport (HKG), any qualified supplier can supply jet aviation fuel. Airlines are free to choose their suppliers and into-plane agents based on price and service, and may also act as their own supplier.

Along the way, transparency is key. Airports should track and publish SAF uptake data to build transparency and investor confidence, linking to platforms like the IATA SAF Registry or national fuel tracking systems. These metrics and key indicators should align with global norms, such as those used by ICAO, with the option to use public-facing dashboards or open data portals for wider stakeholders to access and validate the data, as appropriate.

And as the SAF market evolves, flexibility will be key. Producers like Firefly Green Fuels and LanzaJet are developing modular facilities and diversified feedstock strategies to adapt to market forces. Airports must similarly remain agile – ready to pivot as technologies, policies, and consumer expectations shift.

Airports as proactive leaders

Almost two decades on from the first commercial SAF flight, our research is clear: no one player can scale SAF alone. We need collaboration, not fragmentation.

While our report delves into the required actions for all players across the SAF ecosystem, it’s clear that airports have a distinct and central role to play. They are uniquely positioned to convene all parts of the aviation ecosystem, together with the fuel suppliers and government actors necessary, to orchestrate the symphony of SAF scale-up. And by setting the agenda, convening stakeholders, and embracing flexible, data-driven strategies, they can transform from passive participants to proactive leaders.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/SAF-Campaign-Web-assets-MARKETO-1280x600px-B3.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 05:56:40.360919

The plant will convert about 500,000 tonnes of waste into SAF annually, using a hybrid production technique that combines renewable energy-powered electrolysis to produce green hydrogen and waste gasification, state news agency Wam reported on Thursday.

Once operational, the project is expected to serve several markets, positioning Abu Dhabi as a regional centre for SAF, it said.

The plant is expected to boost the UAE’s role in sustainable aviation, a sector deemed critical to economic development and driving the nation's decarbonisation goals, said Mohamed Al Ramahi, chief executive of Masdar.

“Masdar is committed to accelerating the global energy transformation through partnerships and delivering innovative solutions that meet customer needs,” he said.

Global airlines consider sustainable jet fuel as key to their goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Despite high demand, supply is small while the costs are high, resulting in slow progress.

SAF is typically derived from animal fats, used cooking oil and other feedstocks. It can also be produced synthetically through a process that captures carbon directly from the air.

The greener fuel – which reduces carbon dioxide emissions by up to 80 per cent – could contribute nearly 65 per cent of the reduction in emissions needed by aviation to reach net zero by 2050, according to the International Air Transport Association.

The new SAF development is also key to help decarbonise the UAE's aviation sector.

“This agreement marks a pivotal step … to unlock waste as a valuable resource with the potential to be converted to key energy resources,” said Ali Al Dhaheri, managing director and chief executive of Tadweer Group.

It is the new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) levy, and it applies to both passengers and cargo. For some flyers, this means an extra dollar. For others, it means forty. For an industry built on razor-thin margins and a nation with no domestic aviation market, the question is simple: can Singapore stay competitive while being greener?

In this week’s TransportBT, a podcast of BT Correspondents, host Derryn Wong sits down with Terence Fan from Singapore Management University to unpack whether this new levy is smart climate policy, a necessary evil, or an own goal waiting to happen.

Why listen

What SAF actually is: Cooking oil, waste products and a lot of complicated chemistry. Fan breaks down why this fuel is the aviation sector’s only realistic near-term climate solution.

Will flying get pricier: A dollar here and forty dollars there may not sound like much, but airlines with shaky finances are already sweating.

Cargo counts too: The levy hits freight, although at a level that most forwarders will barely notice. Still, the psychology of cost matters in a tight logistics market.

Singapore’s big strategic gamble: Changi stays competitive by being efficient and transparent. Will a government-set fixed price envelope for SAF keep airlines loyal, or tempt them to route through cheaper hubs?

From Europe’s evolving rules to Singapore’s own SAF ecosystem, this episode maps out what the levy really means for travellers, businesses and the aviation industry holding the republic’s economic lifeline aloft.

Singapore’s green fuel levy isn’t just another surcharge, it’s a bold statement to the world of aviation: that it's serious about playing a pivotal, pioneering role in sustainable air travel.","We all know that flying isn’t great for the planet. But what to do about it? There‘s always opting for overland travel, but not every traveller has time on their side. Short of setting annual limits for frequent flyers, adding an extra tax for air passengers is one way to help bolster decarbonisation efforts – and one Asian country is doing just that.

Starting October 2026 and applying to all tickets purchased after April 1, passengers departing from Singapore will face a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) levy, the first of its kind in the world, as part of an ambitious goal to decarbonise the sky. Don't think of it as a tax. Think of it as a eco-friendly, forward-thinking step to help air travel become more sustainable across the world.

So, what is this tax for?

According to the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), the levy is based on the volume of SAF needed to meet its one percent target for 2026, as well as SAF's projected price premium. While SAF is significantly more sustainable than conventional jet fuel (SAF is made from recycled oils and agricultural residue), it is also significantly more expensive to produce.

How much will travellers have to pay?

Thankfully, the new charges won't break the average traveller's bank. Short routes will only charge S$1 (£0.58), while passengers on long-haul economy flights will be charged S$10.40 (£6.08). Even the highest rate, S$41.60 (£24.33) for first-class or business flights, is still significantly cheaper than paying for an extra check-in bag.

The levy will apply to all tickets or services sold from April 1, 2026, including cargo shipments and business flights, for journeys taking off from October 1 onwards. This might feel like a small price to pay, but it’s part of a much bigger picture, so our planet doesn't pay the price later.

To keep payment fair, SAF charges will vary based on the distance travelled by air passengers and the cabin of travel chosen for each flight. The levy will also be categorised in four geographical bands. Group one consists of Southeast Asia. Group two includes Northeast and South Asia, Australia and Papua New Guinea. Group three consists of Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Pacific Islands and New Zealand, and group four is the Americas.

Are there any exceptions?

Not everyone flying will pick up the green tab. The levy only applies to passengers departing from Singapore to a different destination. Transit travellers passing through Changi (or Seletar) are exempt – the tax is only applied to flights originating from Singapore. Training flights, humanitarian missions and specific chartered services will also avoid the fee. The levy is also only implemented on your very next destination. For example, if you were flying to the States with a connecting flight in Hong Kong, you'd only be charged for the flight to Hong Kong.

Singapore’s green fuel levy isn’t just another surcharge, it’s a bold statement to the world of aviation: that it's serious about playing a pivotal, pioneering role in sustainable air travel. But will other destinations follow suit, or will Singapore remain ahead head of the game?

The agreement, announced at the Dubai Airshow, aims to explore the production and supply of alternative aviation fuel, commonly known as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), at Dubai’s global aviation hub. This move is not just a leap for the airline but also a powerful push for the future of aviation in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), positioning the country as a leader in sustainable aviation practices.

A Step Toward Sustainable Aviation

In an era where climate change and sustainability are top priorities worldwide, the aviation industry is under pressure to reduce its carbon footprint. Emirates’ partnership with ENOC Group is a key milestone in addressing this challenge. The agreement will focus on the local production of SAF, a fuel made from renewable resources that can drastically reduce aviation’s environmental impact.

The two companies plan to assess the supply chain, production capabilities, and commercial feasibility of SAF in Dubai. ENOC, the state-owned oil and gas company, will look into how it can contribute to the local production of this alternative fuel, helping to create a more sustainable aviation ecosystem.

The UAE government has set ambitious targets for the aviation sector, aiming for 1% of the fuel used by national airlines to come from sustainable sources by 2031. With this new deal, Emirates is playing a crucial role in helping the UAE achieve its sustainability goals.

Understanding Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Sustainable aviation fuel is a game-changer in the aviation industry. Unlike traditional jet fuel made from fossil fuels, SAF is derived from renewable sources such as plant oils, waste materials, and even carbon captured from the atmosphere. SAF reduces carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, making it an essential part of efforts to decarbonise aviation.

The development of SAF is vital for the long-term future of aviation. While aircraft manufacturers and airlines are working to build more fuel-efficient planes, the most immediate way to reduce the industry’s carbon footprint is by switching to SAF.

Emirates CEO: A Vision for the Future

Adel Al Redha, the CEO and Deputy President of Emirates, emphasised that establishing a reliable SAF supply in Dubai is a top priority for the airline. According to him, the collaboration with ENOC will help Emirates assess the most practical and effective ways to integrate SAF into its operations.

Al Redha acknowledged that there are significant challenges ahead, especially regarding supply constraints and infrastructure requirements. However, he believes that partnerships like the one with ENOC are essential in overcoming these challenges. These collaborations will pave the way for broader SAF accessibility in Dubai and, eventually, across Emirates’ extensive global network.

Strategic Importance for the UAE

This partnership is part of Emirates’ larger strategy to support the UAE’s vision of becoming a regional hub for sustainable aviation fuels. The UAE government has been proactive in advancing the country’s alternative aviation fuel ecosystem. Emirates is not just a key player in this process; it is actively involved in shaping policies and initiatives that will benefit the aviation industry as a whole.

Emirates is a member of several important committees, including the Aviation Fuels Executive Committee, convened by Dubai’s Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, and the Dubai Biofuels, Hydrogen and Sustainable Aviation Fuel Committee. These bodies are working together to create a sustainable future for aviation in the UAE.

UAE’s General Policy for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The UAE is committed to becoming a leader in sustainable aviation fuel production. The country has set ambitious goals to transform its aviation sector and has targeted 700 million litres of SAF production by 2030. This policy aims to help the UAE reduce its carbon emissions, promote green energy solutions, and establish itself as a key player in the global aviation fuel market.

Emirates, as one of the UAE’s most prominent airlines, is fully supporting this vision. The airline’s active participation in developing the General Policy for Sustainable Aviation Fuel reflects its dedication to creating a more sustainable future for aviation.

Emirates’ Global Commitment to SAF

While the new partnership with ENOC focuses on the local production of SAF, Emirates has already been procuring alternative aviation fuels from various locations across its global network. In its 2024-2025 financial year, Emirates purchased 7,519 tonnes of SAF at airports in cities like Amsterdam, London Heathrow, Oslo, Singapore, Paris, Lyon, and Nice.

This proactive approach to using SAF is part of Emirates’ broader commitment to sustainability and reducing its carbon footprint. The airline has long been a leader in sustainable aviation, and its efforts are contributing to the global push for greener air travel.

A Greener Future for Aviation

The collaboration between Emirates and ENOC is a clear sign that the future of aviation is heading towards sustainability. The development of SAF production in Dubai is just one step in a much larger movement to reduce the aviation industry’s environmental impact.

However, as Adel Al Redha pointed out, there is still much work to be done. Establishing reliable and scalable SAF production requires significant investment in infrastructure, supply chains, and research. Nevertheless, with partnerships like the one between Emirates and ENOC, the aviation industry is moving closer to achieving its sustainability goals.

The Broader Implications for the Global Aviation Industry

The UAE is positioning itself as a leader in sustainable aviation, and the Emirates-ENOC partnership is just the beginning. The success of this initiative could have far-reaching effects on the global aviation industry, encouraging other countries and airlines to follow suit in their efforts to reduce emissions and develop alternative fuel sources.

As the demand for sustainable aviation fuel grows, more partnerships between airlines, fuel providers, and governments will be crucial in meeting this demand. The global aviation industry must work together to create a future where air travel is not only efficient but also sustainable.

Emirates and Air Canada: Expanding Horizons

In addition to its commitment to SAF, Emirates has recently extended its codeshare agreement with Air Canada, which will create new gateways in Canada. This agreement, which was first established in 2022, will now run until 2032, further strengthening the ties between the two airlines.

The expanded codeshare network covers 56 routes connecting Dubai to 37 destinations in Canada and the US. This collaboration will allow passengers to enjoy seamless connections across North America and the Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.

A New Era for Sustainable Aviation in Dubai

The partnership between Emirates and ENOC is a significant milestone in the UAE’s journey towards a more sustainable aviation future. By working together to develop SAF production capabilities in Dubai, these two companies are setting the stage for a cleaner, greener aviation industry. The UAE’s ambition to become a regional hub for sustainable aviation fuels, supported by Emirates’ global commitment to SAF, marks a new era in aviation sustainability.

As the world grapples with climate change, the need for sustainable aviation practices has never been more urgent. Emirates’ proactive approach to SAF, combined with the UAE’s bold policy goals, signals that the future of aviation in Dubai and beyond is one where sustainability and innovation go hand in hand.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Emirates-25.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 19:56:09.958112

Closing the gap between ambition and action

While world figures gathered at the main event in Belém to discuss updated national climate pledges, ending fossil fuels(link is external) and more, global climate leaders and many of the world’s leading organizations met in São Paulo for the Climate Action Innovation Zone.

At its flagship event, the Sustainable Innovation Forum(link is external), leaders explored the private sector’s role in driving a move to a low-carbon, nature-positive economy by closing the gap between climate ambition and real-world action.

Bridging divides, unlocking collective capacity and innovation toward shared goals were high on the agenda.

Collaboration to scale clean tech

A panel session titled ‘Innovation in action: advancing scalable and transformative solutions’ delved deeper into business’ role in advancing these objectives.

Underscoring COP30’s ‘Global Mutirão(link is external)’ concept — which is derived from the Indigenous Tupi-Guarani language and means “collective efforts(link is external)”, highlighting the combined push required to respond to the climate crisis — speakers discussed the need for collaboration to catalyze decarbonization.

Strategic alliances and cross-sector co-operation will be vital, Takajiro Ishikawa, President and CEO, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) America, told the panel, which also included Eliot Whittington, Chief Systems Change Officer, Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership and Nalin Agarwal, Founding Partner, Climate Collective.

“We can’t invent or reinvent everything,” he said of MHI, which has created a program to invest in start-ups and supplement its own research and development efforts.

Describing the range of companies the initiative supports, he gave the example of Fervo. The US-based geothermal energy start-up uses technology pioneered by the oil and gas sector to tap into reservoirs of hot rock beneath the Earth’s surface and turn them into 24-7 carbon-free energy sources for heat and power generation.

MHI’s financial and technological backing, he said, helped Fervo to commercialize rapidly.

This kind of collaboration, with different companies and sectors working together to pool knowledge and expertise, will be vital to achieve the speed and scale needed for decarbonization, the panel agreed.

Rethinking innovation to advance proven solutions

Many other transformative solutions that will sit at the heart of this effort are already within reach. The panelists discussed everything from self-healing concrete that extends the material’s lifespan to using pitch tar — a byproduct of oil refinery — as a feedstock for new material for the tire industry, a process pioneered by Monolith Materials, another company in which MHI has invested.

But as organizations including the International Energy Agency (IEA) have highlighted, many of the technologies that will help take so-called ‘hard-to-abate’ sectors to net zero — including hydrogen and carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) — are not yet available on the market at the scale needed(link is external).

For Ishikawa, part of solving this problem will be reapplying, rather than reinventing, key technologies.

CCUS, he said, is a solution MHI has been working on for the past 30 years and yet it has still “not captured the demand of the whole market”. But as AI hyperscalers look to balance robust environmental commitments with the need for reliable round-the-clock power for their data centers, gas-fired power with CO₂ capture is seeing renewed demand.

“So a 30-year-old technology may be coming to center stage,” he said. “That’s another example of how innovation finally meets the road.”

Bridging the clean tech ‘valley of death’

Speakers also discussed how partnerships between innovators, investors and policymakers can help decarbonization solutions move swiftly from pilot projects to global adoption — and avoid the commercialization gap that sees many promising technologies fail to scale due to a lack of funding and support.

There is a stark funding gap between proven and emerging technologies. BloombergNEF figures(link is external) show established solutions, including renewables and energy storage, drew $1.93 trillion in investment in 2024. Emerging technologies, including hydrogen, CCUS and nuclear, reached just $155 billion.

That analysis noted the public and private sectors alike need to do more to de-risk these technologies to ensure they have a meaningful impact before the end of the decade. The panelists’ discussions underscored this issue.

Partnerships, as well as policy stability, are critical for bridging the ‘valley of death’ for clean tech start-ups, Ishikawa said.

“Although it may have been proven at pilot scale or demonstration scale, for any industry to adopt a technology as part of their mix, there needs to be somebody that has a balance sheet to stand behind it,” he argued.

He cited the example of Houston-based start-up Cemvita, which MHI has invested in, and uses synthetic biology to help decarbonize heavy industries such as chemical manufacturing.

The company has recently signed an agreement to develop a sustainable aviation fuel facility(link is external) in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil — and the project highlights the transformative power of partnerships between innovators, business and policymakers, Ishikawa said.

At COP30, Brazil announced a commitment to quadruple production and use of sustainable fuels by 2035(link is external), along with Japan, India and other nations.

“This is company, local government and the will of the entrepreneur” working to create something new, Ishikawa added on the Cemvita project. “It really has to be all of the above to really get a technology off the ground.”

Ensuring promising technology has real impact

Closing the commercialization gap will be vital, with some estimates predicting that overall clean energy investment will need to rise to $4.5 trillion a year(link is external) by 2030 if the world is to have any chance of bringing warming down toward figures stated in net zero scenarios.

Innovation alone won’t be enough, panelists concluded. Real impact, they said, will depend on aligning technology readiness, market demand and enabling policy.

The partnership aims to create a sustainable fuel supply infrastructure at Dubai International Airport, supporting Emirates’ fleet of aircraft. This collaboration comes at a time when SAF is gaining traction globally, but availability remains limited due to production challenges. For the aviation sector, expanding the SAF supply chain is crucial in meeting both environmental and regulatory standards for sustainable travel.

Overcoming Challenges: Ensuring the Commercial Viability of SAF

While this collaboration is a major step forward, there are still several challenges to address. One of the key hurdles is the scalability of SAF production. Although SAF has the potential to reduce carbon emissions significantly, its production is still in the early stages and must be scaled up to meet the needs of a global aviation industry. The ability to make SAF more affordable and readily available will be key to its success in Dubai and beyond. For travellers, this means that the transition to greener aviation fuel may not happen overnight, but it marks an important starting point for a more sustainable aviation industry.

Looking Ahead: Sustainable Aviation Fuel in Dubai’s Future

The future of aviation in Dubai is looking greener, thanks to the strategic partnership between Emirates and ENOC Group. As the feasibility study progresses and the infrastructure is developed, travellers can expect to see an increasing number of flights departing from Dubai powered by sustainable aviation fuel. This move will not only reduce the carbon footprint of the aviation industry but will also solidify Dubai’s position as a leader in sustainable travel. As the world’s eyes remain on Dubai, this partnership is sure to set the stage for future innovations in green aviation, ensuring that the city remains a top choice for both leisure and business travellers who value sustainability.

In conclusion, the signing of this MoU between Emirates and ENOC Group is more than just a business agreement—it represents a significant step in making air travel from Dubai more sustainable. The city’s commitment to SAF is part of a broader strategy to reduce its carbon footprint and offer environmentally conscious travellers a greener way to visit. As this partnership progresses, it will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of travel in Dubai, ensuring that it remains at the forefront of global efforts to combat climate change. By embracing sustainability at every level of the travel experience, Dubai is setting itself up to be a beacon of green tourism in the years to come.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Emirates-2-2.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 18:57:07.442365

In a joint declaration, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) joined with Japan, Malaysia and several aviation stakeholders to demand that the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) remain the sole authority overseeing international aviation emissions. The group says the sector can’t meet its 2050 climate targets without coordinated rules and without a robust, unified carbon market.

CORSIA in focus

At the center of the debate is CORSIA, a global offsetting framework approved by nearly every country in the ICAO system. IATA and its allies argue that the system should function as aviation’s primary compliance mechanism, channeling billions into emission-reduction projects in developing economies.

According to the coalition, airlines will purchase large volumes of carbon credits through 2035, directing money to renewable energy, sustainable development programs and technologies that poorer nations could not otherwise access.

The group is also pushing governments to activate Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which allows countries to issue certificates authorizing international carbon trades. Only one country, Guyana, has issued such a letter, leaving the carbon supply pipeline constrained and slowing the launch of new climate projects.

Industry leaders warn that governments that pursue ticket taxes or unilateral levies will raise travel costs without meaningfully cutting pollution. They say such moves drain money away from actual emissions-reduction programs while hurting regions heavily dependent on air connectivity, particularly small island nations.

What’s next

Many climate analysts argue that offsets alone won’t stabilize aviation emissions, especially as airlines are seeing a demand rebound. The International Energy Agency notes that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production must expand multiple times to meet global climate targets.

Meanwhile, the European Union is moving ahead with its own aviation climate policies, including SAF mandates and carbon pricing, raising questions about whether ICAO can remain the exclusive rule-setter. The next challenge for CORSIA will be wider participation in Article 6 markets and proof that credits fund real, verified emissions reductions, not just paperwork.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/spencer-imbrock-QL0zAklHUz8-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 16:56:42.004569

The start of these fuel deliveries in October marked the company’s second and third deployments of blended SAF at a major U.S. airport in six months. In May, FedEx announced its first major U.S. SAF deployment at Los Angeles International Airport.

“Each executed agreement signals to fuel producers that airlines are willing and eager collaborators to help to scale the SAF market,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, chief sustainability officer and vice president of Environmental Affairs at FedEx, in a statement. “The aviation industry still faces a mismatch between available SAF supply and carrier demand, but we are encouraged by the early signs of increased SAF production globally this calendar year.”

At O’Hare, FedEx will receive a blend to include a total of 1 million gallons of neat SAF at a minimum 30% blend from Air bp. With its first fuel delivery in October, FedEx became the first U.S. all-cargo airline to purchase and deploy SAF at Chicago-O’Hare International Airport.

At Miami International Airport, FedEx has started to take delivery of around 3 million gallons of blended SAF at a 30% blend minimum from AEG.

Under current fuel standards, neat — or unblended — SAF is mixed with traditional jet fuel before use in an engine. Blended SAF is a “drop in” fuel, meaning airlines do not need to make changes to existing aircraft engines or fueling infrastructure to use it. By 2030, FedEx aims to obtain 30% of its fuel supply from alternative sources on a blended basis.

Aircraft modernization and other fuel savings initiatives enabled FedEx to avoid the use of 140 million gallons of jet fuel in FY 2024, resulting in $400 million in savings for the company. In FY 2024, FedEx achieved its previous goal of a 30% reduction in aircraft emissions intensity from a 2005 baseline. FedEx has since expanded that goal to target a 40% reduction in aircraft emissions intensity by 2034.",https://www.smartenergydecisions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ss_green_aviation.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 16:56:53.171065

Sustainable debt volumes in Africa are rising, reaching a record of nearly $13 billion in 2024. Yet, African sustainable bond issuance constitutes less than 1% of the global total and remains insufficient to address the continent’s development and infrastructure needs. Most of the allocation from green, social and sustainable bonds goes to renewable energy projects, which are key to addressing Africa’s energy transition needs and ensuring broader and more stable access to electricity. Climate change adaptation, water security and biodiversity preservation may benefit from broader financing strategies.

S&P Global Ratings has published 17 second-party opinions (SPOs) for financial institutions, corporates and sovereign governments across Africa. Financial institutions account for the majority of SPOs and have dominated the sustainable bond sector in Africa over the past five years. Sovereign issuance across the continent is expected to grow in the coming years, driven by investor appetite and governments’ efforts to address environmental and social challenges.

The focus will now be on advancing safety and sustainability while strengthening supply chain resilience through closer collaboration with regulators and suppliers.","Asia Pacific aviation leaders struck a tone of cautious optimism at their annual gathering, projecting continued growth despite mounting headwinds from trade tensions and supply chain bottlenecks.

During the 69th Assembly of Presidents in Bangkok, the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) reported robust performance metrics for 2025, with international passenger traffic climbing 10% and cargo demand expanding 7% through September, both outpacing global averages.

However, beneath these encouraging numbers, industry executives are grappling with an increasingly complex operating environment.

The tariff turbulence

No issue loomed larger than the resurgence of tariffs, which AAPA Director General Subhas Menon characterized as an “entirely man-made” crisis. While aircraft and engines remain exempt, the raw materials and components that feed the aviation supply chain are not, creating cost increases that ultimately impact both airlines and passengers.

“Airlines are not against cost increases, only costs that don’t serve a useful purpose,” Menon noted, highlighting the impact of tariffs on both supply chains and consumer demand through inflation.

Charting a sustainable path

During the assembly, member airlines unanimously adopted ambitious sustainability targets, committing to 5% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) utilization by 2030. Thailand emerged as a regional leader, announcing plans to supply 2% SAF by 2026 and up to 8% by 2030 – notably without mandates or additional taxes on frequent flyers.

However, frustration simmered over the industry’s heavy reliance on SAF as the primary solution.

“We are asked to rely mostly on a hard-to-get commodity,” Menon observed, advocating instead for a balanced approach that gives equal weight to breakthrough technologies in propulsion and design.

Military conflicts force airlines to reroute and respond

Beyond economic pressures, airlines are also facing unprecedented operational challenges.

Military conflicts have closed crucial airspace over 14 countries in the past year, with Russian airspace restrictions forcing costly route diversions. Adding to safety concerns, military forces have been spoofing navigation satellite systems, creating what industry leaders see as an ironic threat from those meant to protect civilian aviation.

The assembly passed resolutions addressing these challenges, calling for regulatory harmonization, enhanced regional maintenance capabilities, and improved safety protocols for lithium battery transport, a growing concern as the use of electronic devices proliferates.

Resolutions passed at the 69th AAPA Assembly

During the assembly, APAC aviation leaders unanimously adopted resolutions focused on four pressing industry priorities:

Aviation sustainability: The assembly set an ambitious collective goal of reaching 5% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use by 2030. Leaders are calling on governments to put in place the policies and regulations needed to speed up SAF production and adopt fuel criteria that meet ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) standards. The resolution also encouraged states to implement ICAO-approved systems for tracking and registering SAF while supporting affordable production methods like co-processing.

Supply chain strengthening: Member airlines pushed for targeted investment incentives and streamlined regulations to boost regional maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) and manufacturing capabilities. The resolution highlights the importance of embracing circular economy practices, including recycling and reusing serviceable aircraft materials whenever possible.

Aviation safety – Lithium batteries: A separate resolution tackled the safe transport of lithium batteries, encouraging regulators to bring their practices in line with ICAO guidance for spare lithium batteries. The resolution emphasized the need for better data sharing and clearer public information about how passengers can safely carry and use lithium batteries.

Taxes and charges: Members agreed to urge regulators to avoid imposing taxes or charges on international air transport that are not directly cost-related or don’t align with ICAO guidance. The resolution warns against measures that place unnecessary financial pressure on airlines or hold back sustainable growth in air transport.

Looking ahead: the aviation industry cannot continue to be a “cash cow”

Despite turbulent times, AAPA members remain bullish on 2026, banking on resilient Asian economies and strong underlying demand for air travel.

The focus will now be on advancing safety and sustainability while strengthening supply chain resilience through closer collaboration with regulators and suppliers.

With his trademark knack for puns, Menon concluded his address with a touch of industry humor.

“This industry has been seen as a cash cow for the economy and states,” he said, “but it cannot be a cash cow if its udders are perpetually under repair.”",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/11/AAPA-Assembly-of-Presidents-2025.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 11:57:18.614967

Researchers found that partially suppressing genes in cyanobacteria improved their growth under stressful conditions.

The CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing tool is used to alter the genetic code of bacteria and other microbes.

This research aims to accelerate the production of affordable biofuels and recyclable plastics from renewable resources.

To make beer and wine, a microscopic fungus called yeast consumes sugars in fruits or grains and converts them into ethanol (alcohol) and carbon dioxide. But the microbe yeast cannot tolerate different stressful conditions, said Carrie Eckert, leader of the Synthetic Biology Group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in a recent talk to Friends of ORNL.

One of the goals of the Center for Bioenergy Innovation (CBI) at ORNL, which is one of four Department of Energy Office of Science Bioenergy Research Centers, is to alter the natural behavior of plant cells and bacteria such as Clostridium thermocellum to enable them to tolerate the industrial processes needed to make ample amounts of affordable products, such as sustainable aviation fuel.

CBI, she said, has made small amounts of sustainable aviation fuel using engineered strains of the Clostridium thermocellum bacteria. These microbes make ethanol by breaking down the tough plant material in sustainable woody biomass from poplar trees or grassy biomass from fast-growing switchgrass.

Eckert, a recently appointed chief science officer at CBI, told the FORNL audience about recent research she performed with three researchers at the University of Colorado at Boulder using genetic engineering. By tweaking genes in certain bacteria and exposing them to temperature and light conditions different from what they prefer, the researchers found that the bacteria surprisingly improved their growth while adapting to new conditions they were not expected to tolerate.

Their research results were published in the March 21 issue of the journal, “Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.” Their experiments were performed using Synechococcus cyanobacteria, better known as blue-green algae.

This one-celled species is the world’s oldest organism to perform photosynthesis as it grows during the day in warm, carbon-rich waters in oceans, rivers and lakes. Blue-green algae, which has enriched the atmosphere with the oxygen humans need to survive, is actively being researched as a promising source for making sustainable aviation fuel.

Eckert and her colleagues found that repressing, or partially shutting down the expression of, all genes in their cyanobacteria sample so they make less protein caused its cells to grow better under two environmental stressors. They were temperatures colder than the 37 degrees Celsius they prefer and white light shone continuously on them, replacing the daily cycle of light and dark the organisms are used to.

The new knowledge could lead to the use by CBI of renewable microbes and plant cells from poplar trees and switchgrass (two non-edible plants that grow fast) for demonstrating the scaled-up industrial production of affordable biofuels and recyclable plastics with improved properties.

To change the building blocks of the bacterial cells’ genetic code, Eckert has used the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tool developed by Jennifer Doudna, an American scientist, and Emmanuelle Charpentier, a French scientist. The two women won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their innovative work based on the discovery that bacteria use this tool to protect themselves from a virus that previously attacked them.

Eckert gave a short tutorial to the FORNL audience about two types of CRISPR tools. She said that the naturally occurring defense system found in bacteria is known as CRISPR, an acronym for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats. When a virus attacks a bacterium, it captures a small piece of the virus’s DNA and stores it in its own genome, creating a genetic memory. If the same virus attacks again, the bacterium recognizes and destroys it.

To locate a specific gene to be altered, Eckert said that scientists create a guide RNA that perfectly matches the DNA code of the target. Like GPS for car drivers, the gRNA guides the Cas9 protein it’s a part of to the exact spot on the DNA molecule. That’s where the Cas9 protein uses its molecular scissors to make a precise cut, removing the undesired DNA from the gene.

Scientists can edit a problematic gene by inserting a new piece of DNA at the cut to turn the old, defective gene into a new, corrected one.

It’s sort of like cut, copy and paste in word processing. This technique has been used by medical researchers to correct genetic mutations that cause diseases like sickle cell anemia.

Eckert noted that she has used CRISPR to genetically engineer yeast and E. coli bacteria.

However, in the research she performed recently with her UC Boulder colleagues, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) was employed. This gene silencing technique uses a modified CRISPR-Cas system to repress gene expression without cutting out a piece of DNA. Instead, this tool for gene regulation knocks down, rather than completely knocks out, a gene’s activity.

The mutated Cas9 protein, which is unable to cleave the DNA, can be guided to the target gene where it interferes with the gene’s expression, silencing it.

“The altered Cas9 protein blocks the RNA polymerase from copying and transcribing the gene enough to repress its expression,” she noted. As a result, the gene makes little or no protein.

Eckert said she and her colleagues have devised a method to determine which edited genes are associated with particular traits, such as the ability to grow. The method involves repressing all the genes in the bacterial sample and exposing them to environmental stressors.

She and her colleagues used the CRISPRi gene-silencing tool and a large library of molecular guides they made to understand how photosynthetic bacteria respond to stresses such as changes in light and temperature.

“We built a library of almost 33,000 guide RNAs for targeting all the genes in the genome of our cyanobacteria samples,” Eckert said. Ten guide RNAs ping each gene, producing different levels of knockdown of gene expression.

Through sequencing of bacterial genes in the targeted cyanobacteria that survived the “high-throughput” guide RNA pinging of the genes and through computational methods, the scientists could determine which genes improve growth and which ones inhibit it.

The researchers then exposed the cyanobacteria to a lower temperature than the cells thrive on and to white light instead of the different levels of red and blue light they use for photosynthesis depending on their depth in the water. When the cyanobacteria were exposed to the lower temperature and red or blue light, “they got really sick,” Eckert said. “They fall out of the population.”

She later explained that cyanobacteria have circadian clock genes. They enable the algae to prepare for the predictable daily cycle of light and dark, scheduling photosynthesis during the day and nitrogen fixation at night.

When the scientists exposed a sample of cyanobacteria to continuous white light and colder temperatures than they prefer (22 degrees Celsius instead of 37 degrees), Eckert said they found that the bacterial growth improved.

The explanation? Because the cyanobacteria were exposed to continuous white light instead of the daily light-and-dark cycle of red and blue light they need to obtain carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide to make the sugar enabling them to grow, the circadian clock genes ceased to use the organism’s energy to make proteins, giving it extra energy to spur its growth.

In this research, they found that even partial suppression of all the genes in a genome improved the microbes’ ability to grow while adapting to environmental stresses.

""This powerful technique delivers a faster, more comprehensive way to influence microbial traits for biotechnology,” she said. “It provides more insights into gene functions than traditional genome editing. It accelerates our ability to augment microbes to produce desired fuels, chemicals and materials.”

CBI researchers plan to apply this novel technique to optimize the growth of previously identified microbes used to make biofuels and bioproducts by finding ways to help them acclimate to stressful conditions.

Eckert’s talk to FORNL was titled “The Role of Synthetic Biology in the Realization of the Bioeconomy.” She explained that research at CBI supports its goal to find ways to help create a circular bioeconomy, which will use renewable biological resources to produce large quantities of biofuels and better chemicals while minimizing waste and carbon dioxide emissions.

This approach might replace the current linear system of taking, making, and wasting materials based on finite fossil resources (e.g., using petroleum to make plastics that cannot be recycled and end up in the landfill).

In answers to questions, Eckert said fuels and chemicals that are industrially produced by microbes (often by fermentation of renewable biomass) include acetone, butanol, ethanol, insulin and 2,3-Butanediol, which has been used in printing inks, perfumes, and pharmaceuticals. But she added, while the production of these substances has been scaled up, it is often not very profitable.","https://www.oakridger.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/18/NOAK/87333295007-carrie-eckert-ornl-credit-1-copy.jpg?crop=1378,775,x0,y66&width=1378&height=775&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-19 11:57:23.897303

Founded by Luis de Ita Maubant and Reiner van Gageldonk, the Norwegian startup has developed a platform that combines big data, artificial intelligence, and geospatial analysis to predict where and when charging demand will occur. By monitoring over half a million charging stations in Europe and analysing millions of charging sessions in detail – from traffic flows to land use models, from demographic data to vehicle registrations, all the way to competing services – SurplusMap identifies the micro-markets in which chargers will reach sustainable usage levels and flags those in which this will not happen, avoiding wasted investments.

Going beyond static maps and driving toward predictive infrastructure intelligence, the platform enables operators and investors to make decisions on future implementation. ""We have created SurplusMap to make electrification work in practice, not just on paper,"" CEO Luis de Ita Maubant tells Renewable Matter. ""With unique data and artificial intelligence, we can guide the expansion of charging stations and prepare to integrate them into tomorrow's energy system.""

As increasing numbers of charging stations are installed across Europe, the problem of making the grid work economically remains. The risk is that an indiscriminate race to installation might lead to an excess of supply and loss-making infrastructure.

In Northern Europe, various charging point operators, such as supermarket chains and retailers, already use SurplusMap to optimise networks, while Berlin-Brandenburg Airport is collaborating with the startup to manage the charging of cars, taxis, and HGVs.

Supported by EIT Urban Mobility, the company sees charging hubs as assets for the energy grid, not only in the service of motorists but also as contributors to the stability of the electric system. In partnership with the city of Oslo, the startup is researching how charging models impact the grid and how hubs can become balancing instruments. A pilot project, planned for 2026, aims to prove how public charging can support both citizens and the energy system.

The agreement, finalised on the sidelines of the Dubai Airshow, links the UAE’s largest carrier with its primary fuel provider at a time when airlines worldwide are under pressure to cut emissions and secure long-term access to lower-carbon fuels.

The MoU lays out a framework for feasibility studies that will assess what it would take to establish a reliable SAF supply chain in Dubai. These studies will examine supply infrastructure, potential local production, blending requirements and the commercial conditions needed to ensure long-term viability. A joint steering committee will guide the evaluation, signalling a coordinated effort between two of the UAE’s most influential aviation players.

SAF is a certified drop-in fuel that works with existing aircraft and airport systems. It can be blended with conventional jet fuel at up to 50% and, in its unblended form, can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%. This makes it one of the most practical near-term solutions for the aviation sector as broader decarbonisation technologies continue to develop.

Emirates has been active in UAE-level SAF initiatives, contributing to the General Policy for Sustainable Aviation Fuel and participating in committees focused on biofuels, hydrogen and next-generation aviation fuels. The policy aims to position the UAE as a regional centre for alternative fuels, with a target of 700 million litres of SAF production by 2030.

The airline has been running SAF demonstration flights to test operational readiness. In January 2023, it operated a Boeing 777 flight using 100% SAF in one engine. This was followed by the first A380 demonstration flight using 100 per cent SAF in one engine in November 2023. Emirates also operated flights from Dubai International Airport using more than 315,000 gallons of blended SAF that month, integrated directly into airport fuel systems.

A decisive push in U.S. aviation decarbonization

A new multi-year supply agreement between DHL Express and Phillips 66 is set to reshape the availability of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) on the U.S. West Coast. The companies have signed a contract for more than 240,000 metric tons of SAF over three years, a scale that places the deal among the largest for any American air cargo operator.

The fuel will support DHL’s air operations through deliveries at Los Angeles International Airport, the logistics group’s main West Coast gateway, with planned expansion to San Francisco and other regional airports. DHL will use a book-and-claim system to account for emissions reductions across its global network, a mechanism increasingly adopted by aviation customers seeking verifiable decarbonization pathways.

At its core, the agreement reflects the intensifying pressure on logistics and freight companies to decarbonize hard-to-abate transport segments while keeping pace with tightening regulatory expectations. With investors, regulators and corporate customers demanding clearer Scope 3 strategies, the expansion of credible SAF supply has become a pivotal element in global freight planning.

Production anchored at a flagship renewable fuels complex

Phillips 66 will produce the SAF at its Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex in California, a facility undergoing a major conversion to manufacture renewable fuels at scale. The plant has the capacity to produce 150 million gallons of neat SAF annually, allowing the company to supply long-term commitments such as DHL’s.

RELATED ARTICLE: DHL Leads Sustainable Transport with Hydrogen Trucks in Germany

For DHL’s operations, the supply volume translates into an expected reduction of roughly 737,000 metric tons of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions over the contract period. The company has framed the agreement as a key lever in advancing its net-zero 2050 strategy, which relies heavily on securing consistent access to lower-carbon fuel.

Travis Cobb, EVP Global Operations and Aviation at DHL Express, said: “This agreement with Phillips 66 is a significant milestone for DHL Express as we work towards our sustainability goals. By securing a reliable supply of SAF, we are not only reducing our carbon emissions – and those within our customers’ supply chains – but also setting a precedent for the logistics and air cargo industries in the U.S. Our collaboration with Phillips 66 underscores our commitment to a lower-carbon future and demonstrates the importance of sustainable practices in our operations.”

Phillips 66 leadership echoed the strategic rationale. Brian Mandell, EVP Marketing and Commercial, stated: “This agreement between Phillips 66 and DHL demonstrates our shared commitment to SAF market leadership and credible action in the growing SAF industry. Through our global renewable fuel business, we are committed to supporting DHL and our customers in achieving their decarbonization goals. Our agreement with DHL showcases cross-industry collaboration, and together, we aim to drive progress toward sustainable solutions in the aviation sector.”

A growing global SAF portfolio

For DHL, the U.S. deal strengthens a portfolio of SAF partnerships secured across Europe, the Americas and Asia Pacific since 2021. The company’s GoGreen Plus service, which enables corporate customers to cut Scope 3 emissions through SAF usage, depends on sustained access to high-integrity fuel supply. As more multinational shippers begin accounting for logistics-related emissions within procurement decisions, scalable SAF access has become a differentiator for aviation-heavy supply chain providers.

The agreement also highlights the broader policy and market dynamics surrounding renewable fuels. U.S. federal and state incentives have begun accelerating SAF production, while forthcoming mandates in Europe and rising voluntary demand from corporate buyers are shaping the global competitive landscape. Producers capable of delivering consistent volumes at verifiable carbon intensity levels are positioning themselves to capture a growing share of the market.

What executives should watch

For aviation, logistics and energy executives, the DHL–Phillips 66 deal points to a tightening interplay between corporate climate commitments, regional policy incentives and the maturing economics of SAF production. It also illustrates the role of cross-sector alliances in scaling alternatives to conventional jet fuel at a pace aligned with climate targets.

As U.S. and international regulators consider stricter aviation emissions frameworks, supply agreements of this size show how major carriers are preparing for a future where lower-carbon fuel becomes a structural, rather than optional, element of fleet strategy. And as global trade continues to rely on rapid air freight capacity, the sustainability of these routes will depend on how quickly the SAF ecosystem expands beyond isolated, project-based volumes into consistent regional supply chains.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DHL-Phillips-66-to-Deliver-Major-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-Supply-for-U.S.-Cargo-Routes.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 11:58:21.349500

The sustainable aviation fuel is a strategic of decarbonization policy, energy innovation, and aviation sector transformation. Sustainable aviation fuel is defined by the European Union as liquid aviation fuel derived from biomass, waste oils, renewable electricity, or captured carbon that achieves at least 50% lifecycle greenhouse gas reduction compared to conventional jet fuel, which serves as the primary near-term instrument for reducing aviation emissions without requiring aircraft redesign. This regulatory backbone, combined with airport sustainability certifications from the Airport Carbon Accreditation program and corporate net zero pledges from carriers like Lufthansa and Air France, crystallised demand signals across the value chain.

MARKET DRIVERS

EU Regulatory Mandates Create Non-Discretionary Demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The European Union’s binding regulatory framework has fundamentally shifted sustainable aviation fuel from an optional mitigation tool to a compulsory input for all commercial flight operators is leveraging the growth of Europe's sustainable aviation fuel market. As per the finalised ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation adopted in 2023, fuel suppliers must ensure that 2% of all aviation fuel delivered at EU airports in 2025 consists of sustainable aviation fuel, with incremental increases to 6% by 2030 and 20% by 2035. This legal obligation applies uniformly across all 27 member states and covers over 600 commercial airports, generating a baseline of structural demand irrespective of ticket prices or passenger volumes. According to Eurostat, EU airports handled more than 8.4 billion litres of jet fuel in 2024, implying an immediate requirement for at least 168 million litres of sustainable aviation fuel in 2025 alone. The regulation also introduces a credit trading mechanism, allowing compliant suppliers to monetise over fulfilment, thereby creating financial incentives for early investment. These interlocking policies eliminate market ambiguity and compel airlines, fuel suppliers, and producers to secure long-term offtake agreements, which establish a policy-driven demand floor that anchors the entire value chain.

Corporate Air Travel Decarbonization Commitments Accelerate Offtake Agreements

The voluntary but binding corporate climate strategies are the direct procurement of sustainable aviation fuel across Europe’s business and premium travel, which is additionally expected o elevate the growth of Europe's sustainable aviation fuel market. As per the Corporate Jet Commitment launched under the World Economic Forum, over 70 European multinational corporations, including Unilever, Siemens and Novo Nordisk, have pledged to power 100% of their business air travel with sustainable aviation fuel by 2030. These commitments translate into multi-year offtake agreements that de-risk producer investments. In 2024, Scandinavian Airlines signed a 10-year deal with Neste to supply 50 million litres annually, while Lufthansa Group secured 75 million litres per year from multiple producers through 2030.

MARKET RESTRAINTS

Feedstock Scarcity and Competition from Other Renewable Sectors Limit Scalability

The limited availability of certified low-carbon feedstocks and intense competition from other bio-based industries are majorly limiting the growth of Europe's sustainable aviation fuel market. According to the European Environment Agency, the total sustainable residual oil and fat supply in the EU, including used cooking oil and animal tallow, amounted to approximately 3.2 million metric tons in 2024, equivalent to only 5 billion litres of potential fuel, far below projected demand. Simultaneously, the renewable diesel sector is driven by the EU’s Fit for 55 transport decarbonization package that consumes over 85% of these same feedstocks, as reported by the International Energy Agency. Moreover, sustainability criteria under the Renewable Energy Directive II restrict the use of crop-based feedstocks, eliminating potential alternatives like camelina or carinata at scale.

High Production Costs and Lack of Economies of Scale Impede Commercial Viability

The advanced systems are more expensive than conventional systems, primarily due to immature production technologies and the absence of large-scale dedicated facilities. The high production cost and lack of sufficient support from the government bodies are also degrading the growth of the European sustainable aviation fuel market. This four to seven-fold premium renders the fuel economically unviable without subsidies or premium offtake agreements. According to the International Council on Clean Transportation, achieving cost parity requires production scales exceeding 1 billion litres per plant, levels not yet realised in the region. The capital intensity is further exacerbated by the need for specialised hydrotreatment or Fischer-Tropsch units that cannot be easily retrofitted from existing refineries.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

Emergence of Power to Liquid Fuel Pathways Offers Long-Term Decarbonization Leverage

The power to produce liquid sustainable aviation fuel produced from green hydrogen and captured CO₂ using renewable electricity is a substantial opportunity to leverage new opportunities for the growth oof oftathe inable aviation fuel market. In 2024, the German government launched the H2Global initiative, allocating 2 billion euros to support kerosene production, while Spain’s Repsol began construction of a 100,000 litre per year pilot plant in Bilbao. The International Renewable Energy Agency estimates that power-to-liquid costs could fall below 1.50 euros per litre by 2035 with scaled electrolysis and falling renewable power prices.

Airport Infrastructure Modernisation Enables Blending and Distribution at Scale

The systematic retrofitting of European airport fueling systems through seamless integration into existing logistics is another opportunity prompting the growth of Europe's sustainable aviation fuel market. The aviation fueling operates through centralised hydrant systems that require precise compatibility and quality assurance. Amsterdam Schiphol and Oslo Gardermoen have already implemented dedicated sustainable aviation fuel hydrant lines by enabling a drop in use without aircraft modifications. These investments reduce handling complexity and transaction costs, making large-scale adoption operationally feasible. Furthermore, standardised quality protocols under ASTM D7566 ensure fuel integrity across the supply chain.

MARKET CHALLENGES

Uncertainty in International Carbon Credit Recognition Undermines Investment Certainty

The lack of global harmonisation in carbon accounting for sustainable aviation fuel creates significant financial and strategic risk for European producers and airlines, which is a challenging factor for the growth of the sustainable aviation fuel market. Under the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s CORSIA scheme, which governs international flight emissions, only fuels achieving 10% or greater lifecycle CO₂ reduction qualify for emissions offsetting credits. However, the methodology for calculating those reductions differs from the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive, leading to discrepancies in recognised carbon savings. According to the International Air Transport Association, a sustainable aviation fuel batch deemed to offer an 80% reduction under EU rules may be credited with only 60% under CORSIA due to divergent land use change and product allocation assumptions. This inconsistency complicates long-term offtake pricing and discourages cross-border investments. Moreover,non-EUU jurisdictions like the United States apply their own lifecycle models under the Inflation Reduction Act, which further fragments the global incentive landscape.

Limited Public Acceptance of Novel Feedstocks Triggers Policy and Permitting Delays

The deployment of next-generation sustainable aviation fuel pathways is frequently obstructed by public scepticism and regulatory caution regarding novel feedstocks, such as municipal solid waste or forest residues. Although the Renewable Energy Directive permits advanced feedstocks, local permitting authorities often delay or reject plant proposals due to concerns over air emissions, odour or perceived competition with waste recycling. As per the European Biomass Association, over 40% of proposed waste-to-fuel projects in France and Italy faced community opposition in 2023, resulting in average permitting delays of 18 months. Additionally, the EU’s updated Industrial Emissions Directive imposes stringent Best Available Techniques requirements that increase capital costs for gasification and pyrolysis units. These social and regulatory headwinds slow the transition from pilot to commercial scale, particularly for non-lipid pathways that are essential to meet 2035 policy targets.

SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS

By Fuel Type Insights

The biofuel segment was the largest by capturing 58.3% of the European sustainable aviation fuel market share in 2024 due to its commercial readiness, regulatory acceptance,c, and compatibility with existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure. Nearly all sustainable aviation fuel consumed in Europe in 2024 was derived from lipid-based feedstock, primarily used cooking oil, animal fats and non-food vegetable oil,,s that processed via established pathways like HEFA. Airlines, such as KLM and Lufthansa, have executed more than 500,000 commercial flights using bio-derived blends since 2020 without engine modifications. The fuel’s drop in nature allows immediate integration into the current jet fuel supply chain with no capital expenditure at airports. Furthermore, the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation explicitly recognises biofuels as compliance tools from day one,whilee while pathways remain in demonstration phases.

The power to liquid segment is anticipated to grow at the fastest CAGR of 11.2% during the forecast period, with its potential for near-total decarbonization and alignment with the continent’s renewable electricity ambitions. As per the International Renewable Energy Agency, Europe installed over 20 gigawatts of new renewable capacity in 2024 alone, providing a growing surplus for fuel production. The European Commission’s Innovation Fund allocated 450 million euros in early 2024 specifically for power-to-liquid demonstration facilities, including projects by Siemens Energy and SAS. Additionally, the EU’s Net Zero Industry Act identifies electrofuels as strategic and mandates streamlined permitting for production sites.

By Technology Insights

The HEFA SPK technology segment was the largest by holding a prominent share of the European sustainable aviation fuel market in 2024 due to its commercial validation, feedstock flexibility, and certification under ASTM D7566 since 2011. This pathway converts triglycerides from waste oils and animal fats into hydrocarbons chemically identical to conventional jet fuel, enabling up to 50% blending without aircraft modifications. According to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, over 98% of sustainable aviation fuel flights operated in Europe between 2020 and 22024 utilised HEFA SPK blends. The technology benefits from repurposed hydrotreating infrastructure originally built for renewable diesel, allowing faster scale-up than novel processes. Furthermore, the European Commission’s delegated acts under ReFuelEU explicitly include HEFA SPK in the list of eligible fuels for compliance credits from 2025 onward.

The Fischer Tropsch SPK segment is swiftly emerging at the fastest CAGR owing to its ability to utilise non-lipid feedstocks such as municipal solid waste and green hydrogen-derived syngas. According to the European Biomass Association, over 250 million metric tons of recoverable municipal and industrial waste are generated annually in the EU, offering a vast untapped resource base. In 2024, Finland’s Fulcrum BioEnergy Europe partnered with British Airways to commission a 100 million litre per year FT SPK plant in the UK using household waste as feedstock. Similarly, Germany’s Sasol and LanzaJet are piloting integrated biomass gasification and FT synthesis units under Horizon Europe funding.

By End Use Insights

The large airlines segment accounted for a dominant share of the European sustainable aviation fuel market in 2024 due to their extensive route network, high fuel bburdenand public sustainability accountability. These airlines face intense scrutiny from investors, passengers, and regulators to meet the Science-Basedgets Targets initiative validated net-zero commitments. As a resuresultthey have signed the bulk of Europe’s long-term offtake agreement, including Lufthansa’s 75 million litre annual deal with Neste and Air France’s partnership with TotalEnergies for 100 million litres per year by 2026. The European Commission’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive further mandates large firms to disclose scope 3 emissions, including fuel choices, amplifying reputational stakes. Additionally, their purchasing power enables volume discounts and co-investment in production facilities, making sustainable aviation fuel economically more feasible than for smaller operators. This combination of scale compliance pressure and strategic procurement secures large airlines as the dominant end-use segment.

The non-scheduled operators segment is gaining huge traction by showcasing the fastest CAGR of 36.2% during the forecast period, with private jet charter services, cargo airlines and air ambulance providers— ree fastest growing end users of sustainable aviation fuel in Europe, driven by premium client expectations and niche operational advantages. Companies like VistaJet and NetJets have responded by mandating 30 to 100% sustainable aviation fuel blends on all European departures. Cargo operators such as DHL Express have committed to powering all intra-European freight flights with sustainable aviation fuel by 2027 under its GoGreen program. The International Air Transport Association notes that non-scheduled operators benefit from flexible scheduling and smaller fuel volumes, enabling easier logistics for premium fuel sourcing. Moreover, their ability to pass costs directly to clients avoids the fare sensitivity faced by commercial airlines.

Surging demand from tech giants to offset AI-linked emissions is squeezing supply of durable carbon removal credits (biochar, DAC, land restoration). Prices are now about 4× higher than forest-preservation offsets. Since 2019, companies have spent hundreds of millions, with combined spot buys and offtakes topping $10B (CDR.fyi). In 2024, buyers purchased 8 Mt of durable removals; in 2025 YTD, 25 Mt—yet <1 Mt has actually been issued, mostly biochar, pushing buyers toward long-term offtakes (Isometric/Patch). Patch says ~33% of requests seek biochar but <20% close; reforestation requests 25%, sales 12%. To secure supply, Pure Data Centres Group will invest £24m in a U.K. biochar plant (Wiltshire), scaling in ~18 months to 18,500 t/yr, with three more sites planned. Microsoft says large offtakes “unlock a virtuous cycle” by anchoring projects; Alphabet declined comment. As AI expands data-center footprints—often on fossil power—demand signals are strengthening.

Nestlé, Mars Urge EU: Don’t Delay the Deforestation Law

Major brands — including Nestlé, Mars Wrigley, Ferrero and others — asked EU lawmakers to avoid new delays to the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR). They warn that a ‘stop-the-clock’ or open-ended review would extend legal uncertainty, penalize early movers, and undermine the EU’s credibility with producer countries. The European Commission still plans entry into force end-2025, with a 6-month enforcement grace for large firms and SMEs covered end-2026; it also proposed simplifying reporting by focusing statements on companies that first place products on the EU market. Brands support streamlining but say some tweaks could add burdens for downstream players. They propose: only first placers file statements, while all companies must keep due-diligence systems, act on substantiated concerns, and keep supplier/buyer records. A Parliament vote on the package is next week. The EUDR covers commodities like palm oil, beef, timber, coffee, cocoa, rubber, soy (and products like leather, chocolate, tires, furniture).

‘Existential Threat’: Small Doses of Ocean Plastic Can Kill Marine Life

New research led by Ocean Conservancy warns that ocean plastics pose an “existential threat” to marine biodiversity — and that very small amounts can be fatal. Scientists analyzed 10,412 autopsies: 1,537 seabirds (57 species), 1,306 sea turtles (7 species) and 7,569 marine mammals (31 species). Plastics were present at death in 47% of turtles, ~33% of seabirds, and 12% of marine mammals. For seabirds like Atlantic puffins, <3 sugar cubes of plastic implies a 90% chance of death; for turtles (e.g., loggerheads), just over two baseballs; for marine mammals (e.g., harbor porpoises), about one football. Rubber & hard plastics are especially deadly for seabirds; soft plastics & fishing gear hit marine mammals hardest; turtles are vulnerable to both. An estimated 11 million tonnes of plastic enter the ocean each year — roughly a truckload a minute. Authors say these thresholds can guide science-based targets and policy.

Irish Direct Air Capture (DAC) company, NEG8 Carbon, has signed a contract for Phase 1 of a major project in the UK to develop large-scale Sustainable Aviation Fuel (eSAF) production using a low-carbon energy source. This paves the way for economic production of eSAF at scale, which is critical for decarbonisation of the aviation industry.

The CO₂ provided via DAC will be combined with green hydrogen and nuclear-generated electricity to create eSAF in a specialised process. The eSAF produced will save over 90% emissions compared to traditional jet fuel and will comply with international SAF mandates.

The project, known as Eq.flight, will be led by Equilibrion who are pioneering the drive to decarbonise aviation using low-carbon nuclear energy through small and advanced modular reactors.

Equilibrion was awarded £1 million for Phase 1 of the Eq.flight project as part of the UK Department of Transport’s Advanced Fuel Fund (AFF) 2025 investment of £63m in 17 clean aviation initiatives, bringing to £198m the total value of state investment in this area since 2022.

NEG8 Carbon’s DAC technology is particularly suitable for this project as it uses low-carbon heat and electricity from nuclear, which greatly reduces the cost and increases efficiency of the DAC process.

NEG8 Carbon Founder & Managing Director, Ray Naughton, said:

“This positions NEG8 Carbon as one of the leaders in the field to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel using Direct Air Capture of CO₂. The potential in this market is driven by the EU and UK government mandates to airlines to use more SAF in their fuel mix progressing to 70% in the EU by 2050. This creates a global SAF market with a value of $400 billion by 2050. NEG8 Carbon is now positioned to be a major player in this market.”

Philip Rogers and Caroline Longman, Co-founders and Directors at Equilibrion said:

“We are committed to developing solutions that enable the aviation sector to offer lower emission flights to customers around the world by leveraging low-carbon nuclear electricity and heat. Power-to-liquids powered by advanced nuclear reactors offers the potential for the scale of production needed to make a major impact on climate change.”

What is Direct Air Capture (DAC)?

Direct Air Capture is a technology that extracts carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the air. NEG8 Carbon’s DAC technology works by using fans to draw in large quantities of air and passing it through NEG8’s revolutionary low-cost CO₂ extraction system. The extracted CO₂ is either permanently stored underground or used practically in carbon utilisation processes.

What is eSAF?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is produced from a broad range of materials and feedstocks, whereas eSAF is made from CO₂ captured from the air and green hydrogen. DAC is the only technology which can provide a large-scale source of green CO₂ at million tonne scale at the eSAF production location.

About Equilibrion

Equilibrion is a UK-based project developer and consultancy focused on using the potential of nuclear power to mitigate climate change. Eq.flight represents its flagship PtL SAF initiative, designed to deliver reliable, mandate-compliant fuel at scale. The company supports UK ambitions to decarbonise aviation using low-carbon nuclear energy, bridging energy and climate strategy through small and advanced modular reactors.

About the Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF)

The Advanced Fuels Fund is a UK government initiative that supports first-of-a-kind (FOAK) commercial and demonstration-scale projects. All selected projects have demonstrated their potential to produce SAF capable of reducing emissions by more than 65% on a lifecycle basis when used in place of conventional fossil jet fuel.

The United Arab Emirates signalled a decisive shift in aviation policy by announcing that all national carriers will soon operate under a binding requirement to blend sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, into every flight departing the country. A voluntary pledge of one percent SAF by 2031 already exists, yet regulators now intend to convert that guideline into law well before the decade closes. Moving from encouragement to obligation will send a powerful market signal to fuel suppliers and investors.

Building a Domestic SAF Ecosystem

The government is backing the policy with infrastructure. A new plant in the Fujairah Oil Industry Zone will repurpose waste cooking oil and other residues into 125 million litres of certified SAF each year, with plans to double this output during a second construction phase. Additional joint ventures, including a proposed facility in Hong Kong with international partners, demonstrate how the UAE is positioning itself as a hub for regional SAF distribution.

Non-Obvious Insight: Supply Chain Resilience

Beyond emissions reduction the mandate quietly strengthens national energy security. By turning local waste streams into jet fuel the country diversifies feedstocks and lowers exposure to global crude price fluctuations, creating a resilient aviation supply chain that can support growth even during volatile markets.

Economic Considerations

SAF currently costs more than conventional kerosene, yet the government is exploring tailored incentives such as loan guarantees and carbon credit allocations to smooth the cost curve for airlines. Early scale benefits often unlock rapid price declines, a trend previously observed in solar and battery sectors.

Global Influence

By embedding sustainability directly into flight operations the UAE establishes a reference model that other tourism driven economies can emulate. International airlines landing in Abu Dhabi or Dubai will experience established SAF supply chains, encouraging broader adoption.

We recognise there's significant work ahead to address supply constraints and infrastructure requirements, but partnerships like this are essential to identifying practical solutions and building the foundation for broader SAF accessibility in Dubai and eventually across our network.""

Hussain Sultan Lootah, Acting CEO of ENOC Group said, “At ENOC, we recognise the critical role that Sustainable Aviation Fuel plays in reducing carbon emissions across the aviation sector. This MoU with Emirates reflects our shared commitment to developing local SAF production and the infrastructure needed to make low-carbon aviation a reality. As the UAE works toward supplying 1% of jet fuel to national airlines from locally produced SAF by 2031, we believe this collaboration brings us a step closer to that goal. ENOC will continue to invest in innovation, strengthen partnerships, and explore practical pathways to build reliable SAF supply chains that support the UAE’s Net Zero by 2050 ambition.”

As a safe and fully certified drop-in fuel compatible with existing aircraft fleet and airport infrastructure, SAF can be blended with conventional jet fuel at a ratio of up to 50%, creating an aviation fuel that is significantly lower in lifecycle carbon emissions. In its neat form, SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.1

Emirates is actively engaged in advancing the UAE's sustainable aviation fuel ecosystem through membership in the Technical Group under the Aviation Fuels Executive Committee, convened by the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, and the Dubai Biofuels, Hydrogen and Sustainable Aviation Fuel Committee, established by the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy.

The airline has contributed to the UAE's General Policy for Sustainable Aviation Fuel, which aims to transform the UAE into a regional hub for alternative aviation fuels with production targets of 700 million litres by 2030. Additionally, Emirates and the UAE GCAA have played key roles in developing the UAE's power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels roadmap, driven by the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure and the World Economic Forum.

Emirates also spearheaded SAF demonstration flights on its Boeing 777 and A380 aircraft. In January 2023, the airline operated a Boeing 777 flight using 100% SAF in one engine, and in November 2023 conducted the first A380 demonstration flight using 100% sustainable aviation fuel in one of its four engines. That same month, Emirates operated flights with sustainable aviation fuel from Dubai International Airport using 315,000 gallons of blended SAF integrated into the airport’s fuel infrastructure.

During its 2024-25 financial year, the airline procured 7,519 tonnes of SAF at airports across its network, including Amsterdam, London Heathrow, Oslo, Singapore, Paris, Lyon and Nice.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?
What is Australia's stance on Sustainable Aviation Fuel?","Passenger and commercial flights operating out of Singapore are set to become more expensive after the announcement of a world-first sustainable fuel tax added onto ticket prices.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) recently revealed it would introduce a ""Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy"" for flights booked from April 1, 2026 and due for departure from the South-East Asian country from October 1.

""The introduction of the SAF Levy marks a major step forward in Singapore's effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub,"" CAAS director-general Han Kok Juan said.

""It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub.

""We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.""

Two of Australia's three major commercial airlines — Qantas and Jetstar — offer flights to Singapore.

There are various other international carriers that also fly from Singapore to Australia, including Singapore Airlines, Scoot, Emirates and British Airways.

So, how will the price hikes impact Australians and could a similar tax be implemented here? Let's break it down.

Price increases will be linked to flight distances

Singapore says the SAF Levy will be implemented in a bid to align with the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) goal of net zero carbon emissions in global aviation by 2050.

In 2024, the country launched a sustainable aviation plan to reduce domestic airport emissions from 2019 levels by 20 per cent by 2030.

As part of that plan, the CAAS said the new levy ""is set based on the volume of SAF needed to meet the 1 per cent SAF target for 2026 and the projected price premium of SAF over conventional jet fuel"".

It means travellers on flights departing Singapore will be charged more, depending on how far away their destination is and how much fuel is expected to be used during the journey.

The levy will only be listed as a separate tax charge on airline ticket receipts for people who begin their journey in Singapore.

Travellers transiting through the country or transferring to another airline during a stopover in Singapore will not have to pay extra, the CAAS's Chief Sustainability Officer Daniel Ng told the ABC.

""For flights with multiple stops, the SAF Levy applicable is based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore,"" a CAAS statement said.

To determine how much to charge, the CAAS said all destinations were grouped into four geographic categories based on distance. The amount also varies based on whether the passenger flies economy or premium.

Travellers flying from Singapore to other parts of South-East Asia in an economy seat will be charged the least, at just $S1 ($1.18) on top of the cost of their ticket.

Travellers to Australia will face a $3.30 fee for economy and $13.21 for premium cabin seats, while passengers who fly in business or first class to North, Central or South America will be charged the most — an additional $49.08.

Australian and international travellers have increasingly been visiting or returning from Singapore amid a rebound in air travel following the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

At least 39,590 short-term visitors were recorded entering Australia from Singapore as to September this year, up from 31,370 and 31,140 at the same time in 2024 and 2023 respectively, ABS data shows.

The CAAS said the levy would also include per-kilogram charges for shipping cargo through Singapore, ranging from $S0.01 to $S0.15 depending on geographic category, and private jet operators would be charged a fee per-aircraft of between $47.19 and $7,668 based on the type and size of plane.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) says that an SAF is ""a liquid fuel currently used in commercial aviation which reduces CO2 emissions by up to 80 per cent.""

It can be made from various sources, including oils, fats, green waste and non-food crops or via a synthetic process that draws carbon from the air, the organisation says.

Loading...

""It is ‘sustainable’ because the raw feedstock does not compete with food crops or water supplies, or is responsible for forest degradation,"" the IATA says on its website.

""Whereas fossil fuels add to the overall level of CO2 by emitting carbon that had been previously locked away, SAF recycles the CO2 which has been absorbed by the biomass used in the feedstock during the course of its life.""

At least 175 airports worldwide are already distributing SAF to commercial carriers and more than $103 billion has been announced in investments in the sector, according to the ICAO.

Will Australia adopt this levy?

Australian airlines and their customers are currently not subject to mandatory flight sustainability costs.

Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin Australia do, however, offer travellers the option to voluntarily pay extra to offset their individual carbon emissions made during a flight.

Neil Hansford, an aviation expert and the CEO of Strategic Aviation Solutions, told the ABC he expected Australia to watch Singapore's SAF Levy implementation closely in determining whether to create a similar tax in the future.

""If it's going to be based on the fuel, they'll have to apply an excise … They'll either increase the excise or do a per tonne, per litre rate.""

Australia's major airlines have previously voiced opposition to government-enforced measures that could increase costs for passengers.

In submissions made to a 2024 Senate committee inquiry examining a proposal for airlines to compensate their customers for delayed or cancelled flights, Qantas, Virgin Australia and Rex Airlines all argued against fee-based measures, saying they do not improve the customer experience.

What is Australia's stance on Sustainable Aviation Fuel?

In recent years, the federal government and Australia's commercial airlines have been actively pursuing increased sustainability in the country's aviation sector.

In 2021, the Bioenergy Australia advocacy group reported that production costs were the biggest challenge to airlines opting out of mostly using traditional jet fuel during their flights.

A ""Bioenergy Roadmap"" released in that year by the federal government predicted that ""with increased target focus"", up to 45 per cent of the aviation market could be fuelled by sustainable options by the 2050s.

Bioenergy Australia has also previously proposed the creation of a ""Singapore-Australia-New Zealand Jet Council"" to lobby governments into supporting aviation sustainability across airlines, fuel suppliers, airports and aircraft manufacturers.

Qantas announced in May this year that almost two million litres of SAF had been imported into Australia, in a joint commercial deal made with Sydney Airport and Ampol.

""The fuel could power the equivalent of 900 flights from Sydney to Auckland on Qantas and Jetstar’s 737 aircraft, reducing the resulting carbon emissions from those flights by a total estimated 3,400 tonnes,"" a Qantas statement said at the time.

""This is roughly equivalent to the annual emissions generated by 800 cars.""

In a statement to the ABC on Tuesday, a Qantas Group spokesperson said that Qantas and Jetstar supported the use of SAF to reduce emissions.

“The availability and adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel will be critical for all airlines to reduce their direct emissions and we’re seeing more governments taking steps to encourage and enable growth in SAF supply and demand,"" the statement said.

""Singapore is taking a transparent approach to increasing SAF use and enabling emissions reduction.”

In September this year, the Albanese government announced a $1.1 billion pledge to help boost the production of ""low carbon liquid fuels"", including at least $33.5 million dedicated to a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative.

""The first production of ‘drop-in’ cleaner fuels, which can be directly substituted for existing fuels and work in today’s engines, is estimated by 2029,"" a joint statement released by Treasurer Jim Chalmers and Energy Minister Chris Bowen said.

""Liquid fuels make up around half of Australia’s national energy use.

Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong’s flagship airline, is soaring toward a greener future. The airline’s commitment to sustainability spans far beyond just fuel-efficient aircraft. From modernising its fleet to incorporating sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), Cathay Pacific is taking bold steps to reduce its carbon footprint and revolutionise air travel in Asia and beyond. With a goal of achieving 100% SAF by 2030 and reducing in-flight waste, the airline is making significant strides in transforming aviation into a more eco-conscious industry. This innovative journey isn’t just about fleet modernisation; it’s about sustainability across every aspect of its operation.

Cathay Pacific’s Green Fleet: The Key to Sustainability

One of the primary pillars of Cathay Pacific’s sustainability plan is its modern fleet of fuel-efficient jets. The airline has begun replacing older aircraft with newer, more environmentally friendly models like the Airbus A350 and A321neo. These planes are significantly more fuel-efficient, reducing emissions and optimising operational costs. By 2027, Cathay Pacific will also replace its ageing Boeing 747 cargo planes with the Airbus A350F, which will further lower its environmental impact.

The airline’s shift to more advanced, energy-efficient aircraft is a critical step toward making air travel more sustainable in the long term. With reduced emissions, these aircraft offer a greener alternative to the traditional, less-efficient planes still in operation around the world.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: A Game Changer

Cathay Pacific is also a frontrunner in promoting the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), an eco-friendly alternative to traditional jet fuel. In collaboration with aircraft manufacturer Airbus, the airline has made significant investments to ensure its fleet can operate on SAF. By 2030, Cathay aims for 100% of its jet fuel to be derived from SAF, which has the potential to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of air travel.

Currently, some Cathay flights already use a mix of conventional jet fuel and SAF, which is sourced from renewable materials like used cooking oil. This fuel reduces carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional fossil-based aviation fuel. The airline’s partnership with Airbus also includes a joint investment agreement of up to US$70 million to help accelerate SAF production, not only in Asia but globally, paving the way for a more sustainable aviation industry.

Minimising Waste: Cathay’s Eco-Conscious Cabin

While planes and fuel take centre stage, sustainability for Cathay Pacific extends far beyond the cockpit. The airline is also focusing on reducing waste and minimising its environmental impact in the cabin. Cathay has made remarkable progress in reducing single-use plastics onboard. From 2019 to 2025, the airline has reduced the average number of plastic items per passenger from 7.7 to just 1.5. Moreover, 50% of the remaining plastic onboard is made from recycled materials, and the airline is actively looking for alternative eco-friendly materials to further reduce plastic waste.

One notable achievement is the switch to 100% recycled plastic for all water bottles served on flights departing from Hong Kong. This initiative alone has contributed to a dramatic reduction in the airline’s plastic consumption, setting a positive example for other airlines in the region.

Waste Reduction and Circular Economy: A New Approach to Food Waste

Cathay Pacific is also leading the way in sustainable food waste management. In Hong Kong, food waste from flights is no longer just discarded; it’s recycled into electricity. The airline has implemented a system that sorts food waste at its Cathay Dining Flight Kitchen, sending it to an organic resources recovery centre. The food waste undergoes anaerobic digestion, a process that generates electricity – enough to power approximately 8,000 households annually.

This innovative approach not only helps reduce landfill waste but also supports a greener, circular economy where waste is viewed as a resource rather than something to be discarded.

The Future: Greener Together

Cathay Pacific’s sustainability strategy is built on collaboration. In addition to working with Airbus on SAF production, the airline is also involved in a partnership with the Oneworld alliance and Breakthrough Energy Ventures to fund the development of next-generation sustainable aviation fuels. This collaboration aims to advance SAF technologies in the long term, ensuring that they are scalable, cost-competitive, and accessible across the entire aviation industry.

As part of its holistic approach to sustainability, Cathay also has ambitious targets for waste reduction in the cabin. By 2030, it plans to reduce the amount of waste generated per passenger to just 0.63 kg, a 30% reduction from 2019 levels.

What Travelers Can Do to Support Sustainability

While Cathay Pacific is taking significant steps to green its operations, there are simple ways travelers can support the airline’s sustainability efforts. First, passengers can choose flights that operate on sustainable fuels when possible. Many airlines, including Cathay, are transparent about their environmental efforts, so travelers can be more conscious when booking their flights.

Another way to help is by bringing reusable items onboard, such as water bottles and travel mugs. This reduces the demand for single-use plastics and contributes to Cathay’s goal of reducing plastic waste. Additionally, travelers can support eco-friendly tourism by choosing sustainable travel destinations and encouraging other airlines to follow Cathay Pacific’s lead in adopting sustainable practices.

Sustainability in Hong Kong’s Travel Industry

Hong Kong’s travel and tourism industry is gradually embracing sustainability, with airlines like Cathay Pacific taking the lead. For travelers, this represents a shift toward more eco-conscious holiday options. As travelers become more aware of the environmental impacts of air travel, they are increasingly seeking out airlines that demonstrate a commitment to sustainability.

Biofuel company Sky Renewables has partnered with eight central Queensland farmers to trial growing the crop as a feedstock for renewable energy.

Traditionally grown in Europe, Russia and the United States to produce sugar, beets were first grown in Victoria's Gippsland region in the late 1800s, but the industry collapsed after World War II.

Already working with the industry that came to replace it — sugar cane — the company's chief executive Simon Yim hopes beets will prove superior when it comes to fuel.

As the Queensland government holds its own hearings into sugar's bioenergy opportunity, the industry is hopeful the COP30 climate talks in Brazil will set clear targets to incentivise further investment.

Waste game

In the Burdekin region near Townsville in north Queensland, Mr Yim works with canegrowers to produce biomethane, a renewable natural gas.

""We are trying to persuade the growers to abandon burning the cane field before harvesting so that we can take the tops and trash and use it as a feedstock,"" he said.

But 600 kilometres to the south, around Emerald, where cotton and grains are the staple crops, eight growers have signed up to work with the company over the next two years.

Mr Yim said the beets would be trialled as a winter rotational crop, extracting the sugar juice to ethanol, an ingredient in biofuel.

He said the lack of infrastructure made beets unviable as a sugar crop when compared to the established cane industry, but as a water-efficient feedstock for the fledgling biofuel industry, it stacked up.

""Right now, what was considered waste just a few years ago [has] become valuable,"" he said.

Shahana McKenzie, the chief executive of industry representative body Bioenergy Australia, said there were positive signs that value was being recognised globally.

""There has been a very strong focus on decarbonisation of the electricity sector globally,"" she said.

""It's really good to see that now there is this focus moving towards low-carbon liquid fuels and renewable gases.""

Two years ago, global leaders agreed to transition away from oil, gas and coal at the COP28 climate talks in Dubai, but the deal was criticised for failing to set actionable targets.

Ms McKenzie said the most recent climate talks in Brazil had the opportunity to drive global market development by addressing the shortage of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

""It sends a signal out globally across the countries to say this is now an area of focus.""

Sustainable momentum

In September, the Australian government announced a $1.1 billion program to promote biofuel manufacturing and development, in a bid to provide decarbonised fuel options to hard-to-abate sectors like aviation.

Mr Yim said international interest in SAF production had accelerated since Europe set a minimum supply mandate, which requires fuel at EU airports to contain a minimum of 2 per cent SAF in 2025, increasing to 70 per cent by 2050.

""For example, Qantas has committed to 10 per cent SAF in their tanks starting in 2030.""

Ms McKenzie said regional and rural Australia was in a unique position to capitalise on the interest.

""What we have seen over the past 12 months is absolutely a strong focus from businesses out of the US as well as Europe looking at Australia and saying, hang on, there's a lot of feedstock there,"" she said.

""With that feedstock in the regions, we can be providing economic returns into regional Australia.

""If we're talking about the low-carbon fuels and renewable gas projects, we're talking about thousands of jobs, we're talking an additional 10 billion GDP.""

In Queensland, that opportunity is being explored through an inquiry into sugarcane bioenergy opportunities.

Hearings resume in Brisbane on November 19. Among those providing submissions is the peak industry body for the sugarcane milling sector, Australian Sugar Manufacturers.

""Sugar-derived biofuels [can] provide affordable biogas to regional manufacturers and replace coal to make steel production green with renewable pellets made from sugar by-products.

""This agenda will create thousands of new jobs in places like Bundaberg, Mackay, Townsville and Cairns, and will attract more manufacturing businesses to regional Queensland through access to affordable energy and secure the long-term viability of the sugar industry that already supports 20,000 jobs.""

While aviation fuels composed of up to 100% SAF have been trialled successfully, 100% drop-in blends are not yet allowed based on ASTM International, who set global standards for aviation fuels [Citation49].","Introduction

The global aviation industry has grown steadily over the past decades and is a key driver of global economic development [Citation1]. However, this industry, like many others that rely on traditional petrochemical fuel stocks, is facing multiple challenges [Citation2]. These include increased global demand for energy, increasingly limited petrochemical feedstocks and the pressing need to reduce global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to limit climate change [Citation3].

The aviation industry is estimated to contribute approximately 2.4% of the global CO2 emissions, with this figure due to increase because of the increasing reliance on air transportation for commercial and personal travel [Citation4,Citation5]. Many stakeholders have supported the creation of targets to reduce CO2 emissions by the aviation industry. One of the key strategies to achieve this goal is the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs). Conventional aviation fuels are produced by refining liquid fossil fuel sources. Synthetic aviation fuels, such as those produced from methane (Gas-to-liquid GTL), can be made from fossil or biological sources. The ASTM International has approved a range of non-fossil-fuel-based jet fuel pathways with Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) being derived from non-fossil fuel sources, but also requiring a lifecycle reduction in carbon emissions, no deforestation and no competition for needed food production [Citation6]. Therefore, not all biologically-derived fuels (biofuels) will meet the criteria to be considered a SAF. Current SAFs include fuels derived from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) from biologically-sourced oils or fats, non-HEFA pathways derived from wastes, and those utilising low carbon power sources. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) states that SAFs have the highest potential to reduce aviation CO2 emissions, with a typical 80% reduction when compared with conventional fuels and alternative aviation fuels such as GTL [Citation4,Citation7].

The introduction of new fuels will impact many areas of aviation fuel systems including supply, storage, usage and certification. SAFs and synthetic fuels are derived from non-conventional feedstocks, utilise a variety of processing technologies and, as such, could differ substantially in terms of the types and proportions of hydrocarbons available to support the growth of fungi, yeasts and bacteria commonly found in fuel systems [Citation4,Citation8]. The microbiome of fuel is of importance not just to the aviation industry, but also to the wider fuel community, as microbial contamination can result in fuel spoilage, microbially-induced corrosion, equipment malfunction or failure, all of which represent significant threats to the safety and security of these systems [Citation9,Citation10]. Currently, eight different Synthetic Blending Components (SBCs) deriving from various renewable feedstocks have been approved for blending with conventional jet fuel to produce SAFs [Citation11]. In this study, we explore the impact of three different sustainable blends on the growth of microbial contaminants.

The use of new fuels could lead to an alteration in the composition of the microbiome in fuel, fuel-associated water and sessile biofilms, subsequently requiring an adjustment of monitoring and testing regimes for the microbial contamination in these systems. The aviation industry currently uses different methodologies to detect microbial contamination during aircraft maintenance operations, and it is important to ensure that these methods remain accurate and reliable. Current testing regimes include both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. Culture-based methods include IP385 [Citation12] that utilises growth on nutrient media [Citation13] and thixotropic gels [Citation14]. Culture-independent methods include the monitoring of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) produced by microorganisms [Citation15,Citation16] or detecting antigenic material using lateral flow devices [Citation17]. Each method has advantages and disadvantages and assesses the level of contamination using different metrics such as enzymatic reactions, antibody/antigen interactions or assessment of growth. As such, alterations in the microbiome composition due to the introduction of synthetic fuels and SAFs has the potential to influence the performance of the tests. Therefore, as a first step, understanding the impact of these fuels on microbial community composition is vital.

In this study, we explore the impact of conventional, synthetic fuels and SAFs on microbial community composition, using biomass measurements and culture-independent techniques. There is a small body of literature exploring the microbiome of conventional Jet A-1 aviation fuel [Citation10,Citation18–20] and biodiesels [Citation21,Citation22], but few exploring the impact of synthetic fuels. Ruiz et al. [Citation23] used metagenomics and culture-based methods to study the effect of different fuels and blends (conventional diesels and jet fuels, renewable jet fuel (camelina-derived, hydro processed HRJ-5) and renewable diesels (algal-derived, hydro processed F76 and catalytic hydrothermal conversion CHCD)) on bacterial communities derived from seawater although these systems tended to go anaerobic and are more representative of marine sediment. Lobato et al. [Citation24] studied how two fungal isolates grew when supplied with conventional jet fuel, farnesane or a blend. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, one of the first that examines the impact of a range of potential or commercially-available SAFs and synthetic aviation fuels on the growth of mixed microbial communities as assessed by deep sequencing approaches and biomass measurements. Further, it presents an analysis of the most dominant microbial contaminants across the tested fuels, discussing the effectiveness of current fuel microbiological tests.

Results

Biomass accumulation

The dry weight of samples after 4 weeks of growth is shown in . (The biomass after 2 weeks’ growth was too low to measure reliably and would have benefited from a greater volume being filtered). Microbial growth was evident in all microcosms containing fuel – there was no growth in the controls containing BH medium without fuel. There was no significant difference (Kruskal-Wallis test, df = 15, p = 0.672) in total biomass between fuel types or the two starting communities.

A. Dry weight of biomass after 4 week’s growth on different fuels inoculated with community 1 (C1) and 2 (C2). B. Bacterial (16S rRNA) and fungal (ITS) and gene copy numbers mL−1 of microcosms containing different fuels, inoculated with two communities and harvested after 2 or 4 weeks of growth. Results are the mean +/− standard error. Fuel types are indicated by different shapes (Conv – conventional fuel, SAF – Sustainable Aviation Fuel, Syn -Synthetic aviation fuel.

DNA was extracted from each microcosm after 2 and 4 weeks, and the amount of bacterial and fungal DNA quantified using q-PCR against 16S rRNA and ITS genes respectively (). Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were much more abundant (mean 5 x 107 copies mL−1) compared to eukaryotic ITS genes (mean 41 copies mL−1). For eukaryotic ITS genes, there was no significant difference between fuel types, or week of harvest, but community 2 samples contained a mean of 81 ITS copies mL−1 compared to 22 ITS copies mL−1 in community 1 (p < 0.001). In contrast, there was no difference in 16S copies mL−1 between communities (p = 0.17), a small difference between week 2 and week 4 (p = 0.029) and differences between fuels (p = 0.0028). Post-hoc analysis showed that 16S rRNA copies mL−1 were lower in microcosms containing Farnesane and Gevo blend than the other fuels. These data were not corrected for potential differences in rRNA or ITS copy number in the target organisms as uncertainties in the true copy numbers expected in diverse microbial populations do not improve the reliability of metataxonomic surveys [Citation39]. These differences are likely to be more marked in fungal communities [Citation40] but the overall fungal abundance was very low in these samples.

High-throughput sequencing of microbial communities

High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and ITS amplicons was used to investigate the impact of different fuel types on microbial community composition. For the bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons, high quality sequence data was obtained for the majority of samples. However, for the ITS amplicons, very few sequences were obtained for community 1, reflecting the low biomass of eukaryotic microbes in these samples, and some samples contained few amplifiable ITS sequences for community 2. Therefore, results are presented for all bacterial samples, but only a limited number of Community 2 for fungal samples.

Community composition and Principal Components Analysis are shown in . Generalised linear models were used to identify statistically significant differences between bacteria.

Relative abundance of (A) bacterial ASVs at the Family and (B) fungal ASVs at the Genus level. Replicates have been merged and ASVs whose relative abundance was less than 2% have been grouped as ‘Other’. Taxa ending in ‘sp’ could not be classified at the level indicated – the lowest taxonomic group that could be assigned is shown. Principal components analysis of samples based on (C) 16S rRNA sequences and the weighted Unifrac distance measures and (D) ITS sequences based on weighted Bray distance measures. Each point is an individual replicate. Fuel types are indicated by different shapes (Conv – conventional fuel, SAF – Sustainable Aviation Fuel, Synthetic aviation fuel. The % variance explained by each component is indicated on the axes.

The initial inocula of both communities were dominated by bacteria in the Family Pseudomonadaceae, with contributions from Comamonadaceae, Xanthomonadaceae and Aquaspirillaceae in community 1 and Enterobacteriaceae in community 2. The fungal inoculum in community 2 was composed mainly of the Genera Amorphotheca resinae and Cadophora melinii. The number of sequences obtained from fungal communities was low for many samples, hence a comprehensive analysis of the impact of different fuel types on fungal growth was not possible, but in most samples, A. resinae and C. melinii remained dominant with additional contributions from Hawksworthiomyces taylorii.

When incubated with different fuel types, the complexity of the bacterial communities tended to fall after 2 week’s incubation, with Pseudomonadaceae dominant, and then recover (Supplementary Figure 2). With community 1, microcosms containing Farnesane and Gevo behaved differently from the rest of the fuels, with a greater relative abundance of Comamonadaceae present at both week 2 and 4 and a corresponding decrease in the relative abundance of the Pseudomonadaceae. In community 2, microcosms containing Farnesane and Gevo showed an increase in the relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae (although this was not statistically significant as there was variation in the responses of the replicate microcosms) with a reduction in the relative abundance of Pseudomonadaceae. The other major ASVs showed little, or no, significant changes between fuel types or were of low relative abundance.

Microcosms containing these fuels were separate from the conventional fuels in the Principal Components Analysis (See Supplementary Table 1 for statistical analysis). In community 2, microcosms containing Farenesane and Gevo also differed from the other fuels, although members of the Enterobacteriaceae increased in relative abundance. These patterns were still evident at week 4 although members of the Aquaspirilliaceae and Burkholderiaceae increased in relative abundance. For fungal communities, most samples were dominated by Amorphotheca, Aspergillus and Cadophora spp.

Community members common to different fuel types

Detection of microbial contamination of fuels based on the identification of specific ASVs will be influenced by the relative abundance of core community members. Given the low abundance of fungal ASVs in these samples, analysis is focussed on detection of bacterial ASVs. The ‘observed’ index indicates the number of ASVs found in each sample (note: dada2 processing removes singletons so rare ASVs will not be counted). The ‘coverage’ metric calculates the number of different ASVs that would need to be detected to sample a given proportion of the population (, ). The starting inocula had observed values for C1 of 80.0 +/− 3.2 and C2 of 31.7 +/− 4.65. After 2- or 4-weeks’ growth in microcosms, these values fell to mean values of 46.5 +/− 2.1 and 19.7 +/− 1.9, respectively (averaged across both sampling times and all fuels). Using a detection limit of 90%, the coverage metric for the C1 inoculum was 22.5 +/− 0.6 ASVs and for the C2 inoculum, 4.7 +/− 0.3 ASVs. The dominance of Pseudomonads in these samples was evident as these values fell to 2 and 1 ASVs respectively when a 50% coverage rate was considered.

After incubation for 2 weeks, the coverage values of microcosms inoculated with community 1 fell markedly, then increased after 4 weeks (except in Farnesane and Gevo, where it further decreased). The lower diversity of C2 resulted in much lower coverage values at both time points.

The 10 most abundant ASVs, based on their mean relative abundance across all samples, were used to determine the proportion of bacterial ASVs that would be detected in each sample (). In these communities, which were dominated by Pseudomonas spp., ASV1 had a mean relative abundance of 59.3% across both time points, communities and all fuels, and a minimum relative abundance of 17.7% in any individual sample.

Cumulative relative abundance of the top 10 most abundant ASVs, ranked for all fuels. For microcosms, open shapes are week 2, filled shapes week 4. Values are the mean with the standard error shown in grey; Pseudomonadaceae: Pseudomonas sp. (ASV1, ASV2, ASV13, ASV11); Comamonadaceae: Acidovorax sp. (ASV7, ASV14); Xanthomonadaceae: Xanthomonas SN8 (ASV6); Aquaspirillaceae: Microvirgula aerodenitrificans (ASV5); Enterobacteriaceae: Kosakonia sp (ASV3); Burkholderiaceae: Cupriavidus sp (ASV8).

The greater diversity in C1 compared to C2 was evident in the cumulative abundance curves. In C2, the curves showed sharp inflection points with most fuels indicating the dominance of the Pseudomonads ASV1 and ASV2. Exceptions were Jet A-1 Merox, Farnesane and Gevo, where other ASVs made significant contributions to the overall community. With C1, sharp inflections tended to be seen at Week 2 but were less evident at week 4, indicating an initial dominance in ASVs 1 and 2, then other community members becoming established. Again, microcosms containing Jet A-1 Merox, Farnesane and Gevo tended to show a more even community membership than the other fuels tested.

The ‘core’ microbiome refers to microbes common to a set of samples, but its calculation depends on the thresholds used to determine presence and the phylogenetic relationship between community members. The latter is particularly dependent on the method used to identify community members - an Amplified Sequence Variant (ASV) is an exact, error-corrected sequence hence ASVs may differ by a single nucleotide, whereas Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) are grouped on the basis of sequence similarity (typically 97%) [Citation41]. As small sequence variations are unlikely to influence microbial detection strategies, the core microbiome was calculated at the Genus level. Supplementary Figure 3 shows the relative abundance of dominant community members present at a relative abundance greater 1%. As the communities were dominated by Pseudomonads, this was the only core Genus identified in all samples and both communities. Other Genera were present in one or more fuel types.

Discussion

The move towards synthetic fuels and SAFs has been identified by many fuel producers as important for the future of the aviation industry. In this study we examine the impact of such fuels on the growth of microbial communities. Alterations in microbial community composition in response to changes in fuel composition may influence fuel system design, operation and contaminant monitoring to ensure effective microbial control. Previous studies exploring the microbiome of fuels have typically focused on those found in conventional fuels such as commercial Jet A-1 and military JP-8, diesels and biodiesels [Citation10,Citation18, Citation20,Citation21,Citation42,Citation43]. A metagenomics study [Citation23], looked at the effect of conventional (Jet-A, JP-5, JP-8, F-76) and sustainable (hydro-processed renewable jet and diesel and hydrothermal conversion diesel) fuels on seawater bacterial communities, indicating increased growth of Proteobacteria in all studied fuels but also some taxa being more abundant in certain fuel types. Another recent study [Citation24], compared the growth of two fungi in jet fuel, farnesane, and in 10% farnesane blend in jet, concluding no inhibition or promotion of fungal growth by farnesane. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to compare the impact of sustainable, synthetic and conventional aviation fuels on mixed, fuel-derived microbial communities, applying both biomass measurements and a culture-independent approach.

Dry biomass is a useful metric for the analysis of microbial growth under different culture conditions [Citation44,Citation45]. Whilst dry biomass was too low to determine accurately 2 weeks after inoculation, by four weeks, measurable biomass accumulated in all microcosms, with no significant difference between fuel types or starting inocula. qRTPCR analysis showed the communities were dominated by bacteria with a relatively low abundance of fungi. This reflected the composition of the two inocula used. The relative abundances of bacteria and fungi can differ markedly between sample originating from different locations. For example, Gaylarde et al. [Citation46] report that cultivatable bacterial cells typically exceed fungal cell numbers by ∼100-fold whereas [Citation43] report similar numbers of bacterial and fungal colony forming units (CFUs) in 3 out of 4 contaminated fuel samples (with no fungal growth detected in the fourth sample). Using culture-independent qRTPCR, Krohn et al. [Citation22] found very variable bacterial:fungal ratios in an analysis of 1,258 samples; bacteria dominated fuel samples, fungi tended to be more prevalent in biofilm samples and a highly variable ratio found in water samples (bacteria were always numerically dominant, but fungi varied from almost zero to near equivalence). The communities in the current study were numerically dominated by bacteria, but fungi were present and included those typical of contaminated fuel. Microbial communities will depend on composition of the starting inocula. Such ‘founder effects’ are commonly seen in microcosm studies, but are equally applicable to constructed environments, where microbial populations develop from an initial source of contamination (whether external input or residual biomass that persists in the tank after cleaning). There was a small effect of fuel type, but it is evident that microbial growth occurred in microcosms with all fuels tested (conventional, synthetic and SAF), and therefore operational risks are likely to continue regardless of the fuel type. However, given the diversity of microbial communities found in surveys, different fuel types may more markedly influence microbial communities that have different compositions.

Here, two different starting communities, derived from contaminated field samples, that were maintained as complex communities, were used to inoculate microcosms where the sole carbon source was provided by eight different fuels. High-throughput DNA sequencing analysis showed that the samples contained a range of taxonomic groups (15 bacterial Families, 14 fungal Genera at relative abundances greater than 1%) but that the evenness of the starting inocula were low, with the bacterial communities dominated by Pseudomonads. The number of observed bacterial ASVs declined in most microcosm samples, but the evenness (‘Simpson’ index) increased indicating that a wider range of bacterial ASVs had become numerically important in the microcosms. This is likely to have resulted from an initial ‘bottle’ effect, often seen when communities are grown in confined environments [Citation47] with later increases resulting from the establishment of slower growing organisms and cross-feeding by primary degraders of other community members [Citation29]. The fungal component of the inoculum was dominated by Amorphotheca resinae (previously known as Hormoconis resinae and Cladosporium resinae) and Cadophora sp – both of which are common fuel contaminants. These persisted in the microcosms along with a Hawksworthiomyces taylorii. The latter is not a reported fuel degrader, but is a known wood degrader [Citation48], many of which are found as fuel contaminants with capability to degrade aromatic ring structures.

Previous research has demonstrated that differences in fuel type may play a role in the community composition. For example, a study by Brown et al. [Citation42] found that the bacterial communities in Jet A-1 and JP8 samples differed, although multiple reasons may have accounted for these differences including the routine use of fuel system icing inhibitor (FSII) in military JP-8 fuel and that the Jet A-1 fuel samples came from aircraft in long-term storage in hot desert conditions. Therefore, the differences observed could not be attributed to fuel type but, as with all dynamic systems, other factors may be involved such as environmental conditions, additive packages and geographical location. Exploring the impact of different environmental factors in combination with synthetic and SAFs is an area that requires further exploration.

The composition of jet fuel is defined by specific criteria based on operational capability rather than chemical composition [Citation49]. The fuels in this study had very different compositions ranging from complex mixtures of paraffins, iso-paraffins, cyclo-paraffins, olefins and aromatics found in conventional fuels, through simpler synthetic fuels such as GTL which lack aromatics, and SBCs/SAFs such as Farnesane or alcohol-to-jet (Gevo), composed of one or two main molecular species (see Supplementary Figure 1). Therefore, microbial community composition may be influenced by degradation capabilities. However, the enzymatic systems employed by microorganisms can often degrade a range of similar moieties. For example, alkanes of different chain lengths can be degraded via oxidation to fatty acids that then enter the β-oxidation pathway, with each round reducing the alkyl chain length by 2 carbon groups [Citation50–52]. Also, different isolates of the same species may show different preferences or capabilities for fuel components. For example, different isolates of C. resinae shows different abilities to grow on n-alkanes in the range C9 to C18 [Citation53,Citation54]. Striebich et al. [Citation55] showed that Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and Yarrowia preferred C10-C22 n-alkanes, whereas Marinobacter preferred lighter or branched chain alkanes. These preferences may influence the precise microbial composition, but generalist degraders are likely to be favoured over specialists. Additionally, current SAF fuels are typically blended with conventional fuels in proportions no greater than 50%, thus it may be that the overall fuel composition is not altered sufficiently to cause significant shifts in the bacterial communities when compared to conventional aviation fuels. While aviation fuels composed of up to 100% SAF have been trialled successfully, 100% drop-in blends are not yet allowed based on ASTM International, who set global standards for aviation fuels [Citation49]. As such it will be important to continue monitoring potential shifts in the microbiome that may be caused by various feedstocks, production processes, and varying blending ratios. Although beyond the scope of this project, alterations in fuel composition may require the use of additives such as lubricity improvers, which may act as carbon sources, or metal atom deactivators which can include heteroatoms such as N. These may also influence microbial growth and community composition.

The detection of microbial contamination in fuel systems needs to target the dominant community members, as small community differences are generally not a concern. In some studies e.g. Krohn et al. [Citation22] diverse microorganisms have been identified in both floating and sessile phases, including those that are slow or difficult to grow in culture. Therefore, the detection of key indicator species is an efficient way to determine contamination in fuel systems providing these are representative of the diversity found in field samples and different operational conditions. Here, Pseudomonadaceae, a Family that contains species such Pseudomonas, Moraxella, and Acinetobacter, were dominant in both starting inocula. These organisms are frequently found in fuel systems and have been linked to operational problems [Citation56]. The dominance of Pseudomonadaceae has been noted in previous fuel studies with [Citation57] examining 54 fuel and fuel-associated water samples, noting high levels of abundance of Pseudomonas spp. in 21% of the cultured isolates. In other studies, however, different groups became dominant including Marinobacter, Burkholderia and Halomonas [Citation10]. Unlike our results, a large diversity of genera has been found in field samples from aircraft tanks and previously less studied genera such as Methylobacterium sp. were identified by transcriptome analysis as the most active in sessile biofilm swabs [Citation22].

Analysis of the relative proportions of the most abundant bacterial ASVs (across all fuels) () showed that detection of these would identify the majority of microbes in the different microcosms, although the cumulative abundance curves were less steep for Jet A-1 Merox, Farnesane and Gevo fuels reflecting the greater diversity in these samples. Analysis of fungal ASVs was limited by their low abundance in these studies, but inspection of the fungal community C2 showed that Hormoconis resinae was present in all samples, suggesting that it is as a good ‘indicator’ species for the detection of fungal contamination in SAFs as it is in conventional Jet A-1 [Citation46]. Other eukaryotes were detected with these often associated with fuel contamination or as environmental organisms associated with wood degradation. Other studies have observed uncultured and unknown organisms [Citation22] and a greater diversity of organisms are likely to be identified in future through high-throughput DNA sequencing [Citation19].

Comparisons () showed that, numerically, microbial composition was affected by fuel type. After 2 week’s growth, there was little difference between fuel types, except for Jet A-1 Merox, where the relative abundance of the Pseudomonadaceae and, to a lesser extent, Aquaspirillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, differed. After 4 week’s growth, there were small differences in community composition between fuel types in microcosms inoculated with C1, but with C2 the relative abundances of Pseudomonadaceae often differed, particularly in Farnesane, Gevo and Camelina fuels.

While within this study it was more difficult to compare the profiles of the different fungal communities, it appears that the profiles were all relatively similar to those in conventional aviation fuels. In samples collected from aircraft fuel tanks [Citation22], fuel and water samples were always dominated by bacteria whereas biofilms sometimes dominated by fungi. Therefore, current testing regimes should be able to assess fungal material in planktonic phases, but caution is required when considering biofilms.",https://covers.tandf.co.uk/og/TBFU.png,N,,2025-11-18 23:56:17.067291

The regulation was initially set to become applicable from the end of December 2024, but was already delayed by a year to give companies more time to prepare for its compliance obligations.","A group of major companies* including Nestlé, Mars Wrigley and Ferrero, among several others, issued a new letter calling on European lawmakers not to implement potential new delays and changes to the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), a new law aimed at ensuring that products imported to or exported from EU markets no longer contribute to deforestation and forest degradation globally.

In the letter, the companies warn that new delays will increase market uncertainty, and unfairly punish companies who have already made investments to comply with the new requirements, while rewarding laggards.

The letter follows several weeks of speculation over the timeline for the implementation of the EUDR, starting with a proposal by EU Commissioner Jessika Roswall in September to delay the regulation for a year due to concerns that IT systems currently in place will not be sufficient to handle the data load created by the new rules.

In October, the Commission said that it still plans to have the EUDR enter into force at the end of this year, but introduced a 6-month enforcement grace period for enforcement for large companies, and said that small enterprises will not be covered by the regulation until the end of 2026. The Commission also introduced a series of changes to simplify the regulation, including shifting reporting obligations to focus on the operators that actually place the relevant EUDR products on the market, while downstream operators such as retailers or manufacturers would no longer be obliged to submit due diligence statements, requiring only one submission, instead of multiple ones, in the EUDR IT system across the supply chain.

Despite the Commission’s proposed simplification’s however, some EU member states are still pushing for a one-year delay, and calling for a “stop-the-clock” mechanism to allow an opportunity for lawmakers to re-examine the regulation, as well as for a new review clause which could open up the regulation to further simplification in the future. The EU Parliament is expected to vote on its position on the Commission’s proposals next week.

The new letter follows an initial letter from many of the same companies in early October against the initial proposed delay. In the new letter, the companies state:

“Any proposal for a ‘stop-the-clock’ mechanism or a simplification review clause, leading to a suspension of the EUDR without clarity on its final provisions, would be extending current legal and market uncertainty for the long run. This approach would inflict substantial sunk costs on companies which have made the necessary investments and on-the-ground engagement in preparation for the EUDR, and reward the laggards.”

The companies added that the potential moves “would fatally compromise the EU’s reputation as a reliable partner of producing countries in halting deforestation.”

While welcoming the Commission’s 6-month enforcement grace period, the companies also warned that some of its proposals would not achieve its simplification objective, but could instead result in new complexities for downstream operators such as retailers or manufacturers. The companies instead proposed a “streamlined system” for the EUDR, in which due diligence statements would be submitted only by companies first placing relevant products on the EU market, all companies would be required to establish a due diligence system and to react to any evidence of non-compliance, or substantiated concerns, about products in their supply chains, and to keep records of the companies they buy from and sell to.

The companies said:

“This system would preserve the principles of due diligence and traceability that are essential to meet the aims of the EUDR while reducing the number of due diligence statements needing to be filed and avoiding placing excessive burdens on companies.”

The EUDR was initially introduced by the EU Commission in November 2021, with proposals aimed at effectively banning deforestation-linked products on the EU market, and establishing strong compliance requirements for companies providing or utilizing key commodities and products such as palm oil, beef, timber, coffee, cocoa, rubber and soy, in addition to some of their derived products, such as leather, chocolate, tires, or furniture. The regulation was initially set to become applicable from the end of December 2024, but was already delayed by a year to give companies more time to prepare for its compliance obligations.

The facility is expected to be operating at full capacity by December. Plans are also progressing on a project to add sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) capacity.

During the third quarter of 2025, the HDRD complex produced 2,011 barrels per day, or 67% of design capacity, down from 2,849 barrels per day or 95% of design capacity during the same period of last year.

During an earnings call, Tidewater CEO Jeremy Baines explained that output during July and August averaged 2,920 barrels per day, or 97% of design capacity. The facility was scheduled to complete a three-week turnaround in September. The planned shutdown was extended by two additional weeks due to higher-than-anticipated bowing in the hydrodeoxygenation reactor beds, Baines explained.

Following the planned turnaround, the HDRD complex was also subject to a two-week unplanned outage in October. Baines attributed the unplanned downtime to an equipment anomaly that was temporarily repaired to resume operations. He said throughput has averaged approximately 2,330 barrels per day to-date in November, with production expected to return to full capacity in December after the affected component in reinstalled. A seven-day outage is expected to take place in December to complete installation of that component.

Bains also noted that the company has optimized the turnaround schedule to extend the catalyst life to approximately two and a half years. As a result, the next planned turnaround at the HDRD complex is scheduled for spring 2028.

For the full year, Tidewater expects the HDRD complex to achieve an average throughput of 1,900 to 2,000 barrels per day.

In its third quarter earnings release, Tidewater also provided a brief update on its plans to develop SAF capacity. The company said it continues to advance its proposed 6,500 barrel per day SAF project. Front-end engineering work was completed during the second quarter of 2025.

In September, Tidewater executed an amendment to its existing initiative agreement with the Government of British Columbia, providing for additional BC LCFS Credits. These additional credits are intended to help fund ongoing optimization work as the company works toward a potential final investment decision, currently targeted for 2026. Tidewater said it expects to receive emission credits, in connection with completing the first of three milestones outlined in the amended initiative agreement, in the fourth quarter of 2025, with the remaining credits expected to be received in the first half of 2026.

While Tidewater Renewables remains optimistic about the project’s potential, the company cautioned that the decision to proceed with the SAF project is contingent upon the execution of long-term offtake agreements, and provincial and federal government support to facilitate obtaining committed financing.

Tidewater reported a net loss of $1 million for the third quarter, compared to a net loss of $367.1 million reported for the same period of last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $16.5 million, up 21% when compared to the third quarter of 2024.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/biomassmagazine/posts/web/2022/09/TidewaterLogo_1664229504821.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 21:56:23.990740

Demand policies include fuel or emissions reduction mandates, fuel levies (such as in Singapore) and low carbon fuel standards. Supply policies include research and development (grant) funding, production incentives and contract for difference (CfD) schemes.

Building on its recent announcement of a record $1.1 billion investment in the LCLF industry, the Australian Government has released a Policy Design and Engagement Paper for its Cleaner Fuels Program. The Australian Government is seeking submissions from industry on the architecture of the Program, which aims to stimulate the supply of LCLFs by providing production-linked incentives over ten years and target support towards LCLF projects that are advanced in development.

Written submissions are due on 19 December 2025 with the Program to be launched and applications open in mid-2026. For businesses across aviation, freight, agriculture, resources and energy, the consultation period provides an opportunity to contribute to the regulatory and commercial framework that will support the LCLF industry over the coming decade.

Drawing on our experience, we have identified five key themes in the Paper for consideration by prospective applicants, investors and offtakers.

1. Defining “eligible fuels”: fuel-agnostic v strategic prioritisation

The Paper considers two broad approaches. The first would treat sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable diesel (RD) and other emerging biofuels on an equal footing, with market forces determining which pathways succeed. The second would prioritise fuels essential for hard-to-abate sectors – notably aviation – or de-prioritise those with clearer electrification alternatives.

From a legal standpoint, certainty around eligibility is critical. Applicants need confidence that their chosen pathway will not later be excluded or disadvantaged. Applicants should provide evidence of demand, emissions abatement, and economic impacts for their preferred fuel type. Where relevant, submissions may reference Australia’s broader commitments, such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s net-zero 2050 target, to demonstrate alignment with national objectives.

2. Structuring production support: fixed credits or contracts-for-difference?

The Program intends to use a competitive process to ensure value is delivered with the total available funding and enable benchmarking of the amount of funding needed to enable a facility to progress to production. The Program prefers production-linked incentives to upfront grant payments, reducing the risk to taxpayers where producers receive payment without delivering product. Two competing concepts have been presented:

A fixed production credit (c $/L) determined competitively, payable per litre produced. This could be similar to the current fuel excise rebate available to fossil fuel users; or

A CfD scheme where Government tops up the gap between an competitively determined “strike price” and a reference LCLF market price, with symmetrical claw-back if prices rise. A CfD scheme could benefit less advanced LCLF projects or nascent technologies to bridge the higher cost of production to the SAF market price (after the introduction of a production credit), and to enable such other technologies to mature and become more cost effective, thereby diversifying Australia’s production of SAFs.

3. Carbon intensity thresholds and sustainability safeguards

There is a general expectation that only fuels achieving a specified lifecycle emissions reduction threshold compared with fossil equivalents will qualify for the Program, aligning Australia with EU and US thresholds. Whilst the Paper calls for consultation on the implementation of a threshold, having regard to previous consultation it could be in the vicinity of 50%, which may exclude certain domestic feedstocks, such as canola, in the short term.

Beyond carbon, the Paper canvasses broader sustainability criteria – land-use change, biodiversity, water, food security and labour standards – and alignment with certification schemes under the evolving Guarantee of Origin (GO) scheme which will include LCLFs from 2026. Early engagement with certifiers and the development of robust traceability systems will be important. Applicants and those involved in the supply chain may wish to separately review their supply contracts to ensure that sustainability obligations and data-sharing rights required for GO reporting are addressed.

4. Community benefits

The development of a LCLFs industry presents many economic opportunities to Australian communities, including by securing sovereign fuel supply resulting in lower fuel costs, and creating jobs in rural and regional areas where crops such as sugar cane and canola (used in the hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) SAF production method) are plentiful.

The Paper asks whether production supported by the Program should be restricted to domestic use. For projects seeking economies of scale through regional exports, including to SAF markets in Asia, this is a relevant consideration. Evidence that export flexibility could enhance domestic supply security may be persuasive.

Additionally, as the Cleaner Fuels Program is administered under the Future Made in Australia Act 2024 (Cth), applicants must demonstrate compliance with six community benefit principles, including promoting safe and secure jobs, supporting First Nations participation, and demonstrating transparency and compliance in relation to the management of tax affairs. In practice, this means proponents could provide social procurement plans, local workforce strategies, and mechanisms for First Nations equity or benefit-sharing.

5. A complex policy intersection

The Program will not operate in isolation. Prospective applicants should map interactions with:

The Safeguard Mechanism, the Australian Government's policy for reducing emissions at large industrial facilities;

The New Vehicle Efficiency Standard, influencing demand for renewable diesel in heavy transport;

State planning and environmental regulations; and

Finance pathways via the National Reconstruction Fund, CEFC or Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility.

Each layer involves its own compliance obligations, information requirements and reporting timelines. Coordinated legal advice across environmental, trade, tax, and project finance can assist in managing these requirements efficiently.

Looking ahead – aligning policy ambition with market reality

Australia’s resource endowment – from abundant biomass residues to renewable electricity for e-fuels – positions it well to capture a share of the burgeoning global sustainable fuels market. Projects that are ready to move to final investment decision will likely benefit most from the Program.

For Government, the policy challenge is to design a scheme that supports projects without creating ongoing subsidy dependence or favouring established technologies over innovation. Transparent, bankable, and adaptable incentives will be important. Alignment with international sustainability standards may assist Australian fuel in accessing premium markets overseas, while community benefit obligations can support social licence domestically.

For industry, early engagement, collaboration, and preparation to demonstrate technological capability, carbon integrity, community value, and financial discipline will be key to success in the Program and future commercial benefit from participating in the LCLF industry. The upcoming consultation period provides applicants with a critical opportunity to contribute to the development of the sector’s regulatory framework.",https://www.claytonutz.com/cfimages/CU-Insights.webp/public,N,,2025-11-18 21:56:29.638685

Opening Summary

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the aviation industry currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, with projections showing air travel demand could double by 2040. In my work with major airlines and aerospace manufacturers, I’ve witnessed firsthand the immense pressure this creates. The industry stands at a critical inflection point where sustainability isn’t just an environmental concern—it’s becoming the primary driver of innovation and competitive advantage. As a technology futurist who has advised Fortune 500 companies on digital transformation, I see Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) emerging as the cornerstone of aviation’s future. The current landscape reveals an industry grappling with legacy infrastructure while racing toward a cleaner, more efficient future. What fascinates me most is how quickly this transformation is accelerating—we’re not talking about distant possibilities but immediate business imperatives that will reshape global aviation within this decade.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The SAF Production and Scalability Dilemma

The most pressing challenge I consistently encounter in my consulting work is the massive gap between SAF demand and production capacity. According to McKinsey & Company analysis, SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of global jet fuel consumption, despite growing commitments from airlines and corporate travelers. The fundamental issue lies in scaling production to meet ambitious net-zero targets. I’ve seen airline executives struggle with this reality—they want to commit to SAF but face limited availability and premium pricing. As noted by the World Economic Forum, scaling SAF production requires overcoming significant technological and economic barriers, including high capital costs for production facilities and competition for sustainable feedstocks. The business impact is substantial: airlines risk missing sustainability targets, facing regulatory penalties, and losing environmentally conscious customers to competitors who secure scarce SAF supplies.

Challenge 2: Infrastructure and Supply Chain Transformation

The second major challenge involves overhauling century-old aviation infrastructure and supply chains. In my experience working with airport operators and fuel suppliers, I’ve observed how existing infrastructure was designed for conventional jet fuel, creating compatibility issues with new fuel types. Deloitte research highlights that adapting current refueling systems, storage facilities, and distribution networks for SAF requires massive capital investment and coordinated industry effort. The implications extend beyond airports to the entire value chain—from feedstock producers to fuel blenders and distributors. What many business leaders underestimate is the domino effect: a single change in fuel composition can impact aircraft performance, maintenance schedules, and operational procedures. This infrastructure challenge represents what I call a “systemic innovation barrier”—where progress in one area is hindered by limitations in interconnected systems.

Challenge 3: Economic Viability and Investment Uncertainty

The third challenge that keeps aviation executives awake at night is achieving economic viability while managing investment risks. Harvard Business Review analysis indicates that SAF currently costs 2-4 times more than conventional jet fuel, creating significant financial pressure on airlines already operating on thin margins. In my strategic foresight sessions with industry leaders, I’ve seen how this cost differential creates a classic chicken-and-egg scenario: without scale, costs remain high, but without cost reduction, scale remains elusive. PwC’s aviation outlook reinforces this concern, noting that the capital required to build sufficient SAF production capacity exceeds $1 trillion globally. The business impact is profound: airlines must balance sustainability commitments with financial performance, while investors weigh the risks of backing emerging SAF technologies against established energy investments.

Solutions and Innovations

The good news is that innovative solutions are emerging faster than many industry observers predicted. From my front-row seat watching technological evolution, I’m particularly excited about three breakthrough approaches that are gaining traction.

First, advanced biofuel pathways using novel feedstocks are demonstrating remarkable potential. Companies like LanzaJet are commercializing alcohol-to-jet technology that can use ethanol from various sources, including agricultural waste and non-food biomass. I’ve seen this technology in action during my research visits, and what impresses me is its flexibility—it can adapt to regional feedstock availability, making it scalable across different geographies.

Second, power-to-liquid (PtL) technologies represent what I believe will be the ultimate game-changer. According to recent Accenture analysis, synthetic fuels produced using renewable electricity, water, and captured CO2 could eventually supply up to 15% of global aviation fuel demand by 2050. Major players like Airbus are investing heavily in these technologies, recognizing their potential to decouple fuel production from biological constraints.

Third, digital fuel management platforms are creating unprecedented transparency and efficiency. In my consulting work, I’ve helped implement blockchain-based tracking systems that provide certified proof of sustainability from production to consumption. These platforms create value by enabling premium pricing for verified sustainable fuels while giving corporate customers the carbon accounting data they increasingly demand.

The most forward-thinking organizations are combining these solutions with strategic partnerships. United Airlines’ investment in multiple SAF startups exemplifies this approach—spreading risk while accelerating multiple technological pathways simultaneously.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Based on my analysis of technological trajectories and industry commitments, I project that SAF will account for at least 10% of global aviation fuel by 2035, with some regions potentially reaching 15-20%. Goldman Sachs Research estimates the SAF market could grow from approximately $500 million today to over $30 billion by 2030, representing one of the fastest-growing segments in clean energy.

My foresight exercises with industry leaders reveal several “what if” scenarios that could accelerate this transformation. What if major oil companies reallocate 20% of their conventional fuel investment to SAF production? What if carbon taxes make conventional jet fuel 50% more expensive within five years? What if corporate travel policies mandate 25% SAF usage for all business flights by 2028? Each of these scenarios points toward the same conclusion: the SAF transition will happen faster than current linear projections suggest.

I expect several technological breakthroughs within the next 3-5 years that will dramatically change the economics of SAF production. Advanced catalytic processes could reduce production costs by 40-60%, while synthetic biology approaches using engineered microorganisms could increase feedstock conversion efficiency beyond current limits. The International Energy Agency projects that supportive policies and technological learning could make SAF cost-competitive with conventional jet fuel by 2030 in favorable regulatory environments.

The industry transformation will follow a clear timeline: demonstration-scale plants becoming operational within 2-3 years, first commercial-scale facilities by 2026-2028, and widespread adoption through the 2030s. By 2035, I predict that SAF will no longer be a niche product but a standard component of aviation fuel blends worldwide.

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

Over the next decade, aviation will undergo its most significant transformation since the jet age. SAF will evolve from a sustainability initiative to a core business strategy, with leading airlines leveraging their SAF access as a competitive differentiator. The opportunities are massive: first-movers in SAF production and distribution will capture extraordinary value, while airlines that secure long-term SAF contracts will enjoy premium brand positioning and customer loyalty. The risks are equally significant: organizations that delay their SAF strategies face regulatory pressure, reputational damage, and potential exclusion from key markets with strict sustainability requirements. The fundamental shift I foresee is from viewing SAF as an environmental compliance cost to recognizing it as a strategic asset that drives business resilience and growth.

Ian Khan’s Closing

In my two decades of studying technological transformations, I’ve never witnessed an industry pivot as rapidly and decisively as aviation is doing with SAF. The future belongs to those who recognize that sustainability and profitability are not opposing forces but complementary objectives. As I often tell the leaders I work with: “The greatest risk isn’t in moving too fast toward the future—it’s in moving too slow.”

Opening Summary

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the aviation industry currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, with projections showing this could triple by 2050 without significant intervention. In my work advising global aviation leaders, I’ve witnessed firsthand the urgent pressure to decarbonize while maintaining growth. The current sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production stands at just 0.1% of total jet fuel demand, as reported by McKinsey & Company, creating both an enormous challenge and unprecedented opportunity. What fascinates me most is how this tiny fraction represents the seed of a complete industry transformation that will redefine air travel as we know it. We’re not just talking about incremental changes here – we’re witnessing the birth of an entirely new energy ecosystem that will reshape global supply chains, create new economic powerhouses, and fundamentally alter how we think about mobility. The race to scale SAF production is accelerating, and the decisions made today will determine which organizations lead tomorrow’s aviation landscape.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The Production Scale-Up Dilemma

The most immediate challenge I observe in my consulting work with aviation leaders is the massive gap between current SAF production capacity and projected demand. According to Deloitte research, global SAF production needs to increase by at least 1,000 times current levels to meet 2030 targets. What makes this particularly complex isn’t just building more facilities – it’s creating an entirely new industrial ecosystem. I’ve sat in boardrooms where executives grapple with the chicken-and-egg problem: airlines can’t commit to SAF without reliable supply, and producers can’t secure funding without airline commitments. The World Economic Forum notes that current SAF production costs remain 2-4 times higher than conventional jet fuel, creating significant economic headwinds. This isn’t merely a technical challenge; it’s a complete rethinking of energy infrastructure that requires unprecedented collaboration across traditionally separate industries.

Challenge 2: Feedstock Availability and Sustainability Certification

In my analysis of SAF supply chains, the feedstock question emerges as perhaps the most complex puzzle. As noted by Harvard Business Review, the competition for sustainable biomass between aviation, maritime, and other industries will intensify dramatically in the coming years. I’ve consulted with organizations struggling to navigate the intricate web of sustainability certifications, land use concerns, and competing environmental priorities. The challenge extends beyond simply finding enough raw materials – it’s about creating systems that are genuinely sustainable and verifiable. PwC research indicates that without careful management, the rush to secure feedstocks could create unintended environmental consequences or conflict with food production. What keeps aviation CEOs awake at night isn’t just finding feedstocks today, but ensuring they can scale sustainably while maintaining public trust and regulatory compliance.

Challenge 3: Infrastructure Integration and Global Standards

The third critical challenge I consistently encounter involves the physical and regulatory infrastructure required for SAF adoption. According to Accenture analysis, less than 5% of global airports currently have dedicated SAF blending and storage facilities. This creates a logistical nightmare for airlines trying to maintain consistent operations across their networks. In my strategic foresight work, I help organizations visualize the cascading effects of infrastructure gaps – from blending inconsistencies to transportation bottlenecks. The lack of global standards compounds these challenges, creating regulatory fragmentation that increases costs and complexity. Gartner research highlights that without standardized certification and accounting methods, the risk of greenwashing accusations remains high, potentially undermining the entire transition effort. This isn’t just about building new infrastructure; it’s about creating interoperable systems that work seamlessly across borders and organizations.

Solutions and Innovations

The good news is that innovative solutions are emerging faster than many predicted. In my research for “The Futurist” series, I’ve identified several breakthrough approaches that are gaining traction. First, advanced biofuels using novel feedstocks like agricultural waste, algae, and municipal solid waste are showing remarkable potential. Companies like LanzaJet are demonstrating that waste-to-fuel pathways can achieve up to 70% reduction in lifecycle emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

Second, power-to-liquid (PtL) technologies represent what I believe will be the ultimate game-changer. By combining captured CO2 with green hydrogen, these synthetic fuels can achieve near-carbon-neutral operations. The European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate specifically includes PtL targets, signaling strong regulatory support. I’ve advised several energy companies that are positioning themselves at this intersection of renewable energy and fuel production.

Third, digital tracking and certification platforms are addressing the transparency challenge. Blockchain-based systems, similar to those I’ve helped implement in other supply chain contexts, are enabling real-time tracking of sustainability attributes from production to consumption. This creates the audit trail needed for credible emissions accounting and helps prevent double-counting of environmental benefits.

Fourth, strategic partnerships between airlines, fuel producers, and technology companies are accelerating innovation. The collaboration between United Airlines, Honeywell, and Alder Fuels demonstrates how cross-industry alliances can de-risk development and scale production more rapidly. In my consulting practice, I’m seeing these partnerships become increasingly sophisticated, with shared investment models and risk-sharing arrangements that would have been unthinkable a decade ago.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Based on my analysis of current trajectories and technological breakthroughs, I project that SAF will account for at least 15-20% of global aviation fuel by 2035. According to BloombergNEF forecasts, the SAF market could grow from approximately $500 million in 2023 to over $30 billion by 2030. This represents one of the most rapid energy transitions in modern history.

What excites me most are the potential technological breakthroughs on the horizon. In my foresight exercises with industry leaders, we explore scenarios where synthetic biology enables cost-competitive SAF production from CO2 captured directly from the air. McKinsey analysis suggests that with sufficient investment and policy support, power-to-liquid fuels could achieve price parity with conventional jet fuel by the early 2030s.

The geographical distribution of production will also transform global energy flows. While current SAF production is concentrated in North America and Europe, I predict that Asia and the Middle East will emerge as major production hubs by the late 2020s. This shift will create new energy trade routes and potentially redistribute economic power within the aviation ecosystem.

Market size predictions vary, but Goldman Sachs Research estimates the total addressable market for SAF could reach $2 trillion by 2050. What’s particularly significant is how this growth will catalyze adjacent industries – from carbon capture technology to hydrogen production to advanced biotechnology. We’re not just watching a fuel transition; we’re witnessing the creation of an entirely new industrial cluster.

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

Over the next decade, sustainable aviation fuel will evolve from a niche product to a mainstream energy source that fundamentally reshapes aviation economics and operations. The organizations that thrive will be those that approach SAF not as a compliance requirement but as a strategic opportunity to build competitive advantage. We’ll see consolidation among producers, new alliances between energy and aviation companies, and the emergence of SAF as a traded commodity with its own market dynamics. The risks are significant – technological hurdles, policy uncertainty, and cost pressures could slow adoption. However, the opportunities for first-movers are enormous, from securing preferential supply arrangements to developing proprietary production technologies. The next ten years will determine which organizations lead aviation’s sustainable future.

Ian Khan’s Closing

The transition to sustainable aviation represents one of the most exciting industrial transformations of our lifetime. As I often tell leaders in my keynotes: “The future belongs to those who see opportunities where others see obstacles, and who build bridges where others see barriers.”

Ensure Changi Airport remains price competitive with green jet fuel levy

” (Nov 13).

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has set a long-term aspirational goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions for international aviation by 2050. Various ICAO members, including the European Union, Japan, South Korea and the UK, have mandated or plan to mandate the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to work towards this goal. Singapore is not the first or only country to do so, and we have chosen to do so in a pragmatic and balanced manner.

We have set the SAF levy for an economy ticket at between $1 and $10.40, and the equivalent levies for business- and first-class tickets at between $4 and $41.60. This endeavours to keep costs manageable and ensures that our air hub remains price competitive.

The SAF levy will apply for tickets and services sold from April 1, 2026, for flights departing from Singapore from Oct 1, 2026, with the SAF levy amounts remaining unchanged even if SAF prices were to rise later. We have consulted the industry and stakeholders, and do not expect the SAF levy to have a significant effect on air travel demand and the price competitiveness of Changi Airport.

Despite a challenging external operating environment in 2025, Changi Airport is seeing strong growth. Barring unforeseen circumstances, we will surpass 2024 and set a record in air passenger volume in 2025. We will continue to keep a keen eye on cost and ensure that Changi Airport remains price competitive vis-a-vis other airports.

We thank Mr Tan for his support for Changi Airport, a national icon and source of pride for many Singaporeans.

Etihad Airways, the national airline of the United Arab Emirates, has taken a decisive step toward solidifying its position as one of the most forward-looking carriers in the modern aviation landscape. During the Dubai Airshow, one of the industry’s most prestigious events, the airline announced a substantial expansion of its widebody fleet with a firm order for six Airbus A330-900s, seven additional A350-1000s, and three A350F freighters. This agreement not only reinforces the long-standing partnership between Etihad Airways and Airbus but also reflects the carrier’s strategic vision to enhance operational efficiency, expand global reach, and align its operations with emerging environmental and sustainability standards in aviation.

Strengthening Fleet Capabilities & Market Position

Etihad Airways’ new orders represent a significant expansion of its current capabilities across multiple operational domains—medium-haul, long-haul, and cargo. With the addition of six A330-900s and nine leased units of the same type from Avolon, the airline is establishing a dedicated fleet segment tailored for regional and mid-range routes. The A330neo’s balance of fuel efficiency, passenger comfort, and operational flexibility makes it particularly well-suited to Etihad’s growth markets in Asia, Europe, and Africa. The aircraft’s capability to fly up to 8,100 nautical miles without refuelling enhances Etihad’s ability to serve secondary city pairs more efficiently, strengthening its competitive position in connecting East and West through its Abu Dhabi hub.

The inclusion of seven additional A350-1000s raises Etihad’s total orders for this aircraft type to 27, reaffirming its commitment to using one of the most advanced, fuel-efficient, and passenger-friendly long-haul aircraft currently available. The A350-1000’s unparalleled range of up to 9,700 nautical miles allows Etihad to expand its intercontinental network, reaching destinations such as North America, East Asia, and the Pacific with enhanced efficiency and reliability. This expansion also creates the opportunity to standardize operations around Airbus’s most modern widebody family, reducing maintenance complexity, crew training costs, and overall operational inefficiency.

The order for three additional A350F freighters further underlines the airline’s recognition of cargo as a critical growth segment. With global freight demand rebounding and e-commerce driving new forms of logistical supply chains, these freighters will provide Etihad Cargo with the necessary capability and payload performance to compete effectively in international logistics markets. The A350F, equipped with the largest main deck cargo door in the industry and full compliance with ICAO’s upcoming CO₂ standards, positions Etihad as a pioneer in sustainable air freight operations.

Partnership with Airbus & Shared Vision for Sustainable Aviation

The announcements made at the Dubai Airshow underscore the deepening collaboration between Etihad Airways and Airbus. Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, Airbus Executive Vice President for Sales, emphasized that Etihad’s continued investment in next-generation aircraft highlights the strength of this partnership and a mutual commitment to shaping the future of aviation in the UAE and beyond. The complementarity between the A350 Family and A330neo platforms offers Etihad an optimal combination of operational efficiency and network flexibility. By strategically diversifying its fleet with these two models, Etihad is effectively future-proofing its operations amid evolving regulatory, economic, and environmental challenges.

Both aircraft families are emblematic of Airbus’s technological evolution. The A350 Family, constructed using advanced composite materials and equipped with state-of-the-art Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines, achieves a 25% reduction in fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions compared to older widebody models. Similarly, the A330neo, powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, incorporates advanced aerodynamics and a redefined Airspace cabin design that enhances not only the passenger experience but also fuel efficiency and reliability.

Furthermore, Airbus’s commitment to sustainability closely aligns with Etihad’s environmental objectives. Both the A330neo and A350 are certified to operate on up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with Airbus targeting 100% SAF capability by 2030. Etihad Airways has been at the forefront of SAF adoption and green aviation initiatives, making this compatibility a vital part of its long-term environmental strategy. The synergy between technological innovation and sustainability highlights an emerging trend in global aviation where performance, profitability, and ecological responsibility are becoming inseparable aspects of business planning.

Economic & Strategic Implications

Etihad’s decision to expand its Airbus widebody fleet carries significant economic, operational, and strategic implications. From a financial perspective, the investment demonstrates confidence in air travel’s post-pandemic recovery and the UAE’s ambition to remain a premier global aviation hub. Given the competitive environment among Middle Eastern carriers—especially regional powerhouses such as Emirates and Qatar Airways—Etihad’s fleet diversification ensures both competitiveness and adaptability. The airline can more precisely match aircraft capacity to route demand, thus optimizing load factors and minimizing unnecessary operating costs.

From a macroeconomic standpoint, the deal underscores the aviation sector’s broader role in supporting economic diversification under the UAE’s national growth agenda. Etihad’s partnership with Airbus not only strengthens bilateral industrial ties between the UAE and Europe but also fosters innovation, employment, and investment within the region’s aviation ecosystem. This development contributes to Abu Dhabi’s strategic goal of positioning itself as a center for high-technology industries, environmental innovation, and sustainable tourism.

Advancing the Future of Global Aviation

Beyond its immediate operational benefits, Etihad Airways’ fleet expansion signals a broader transformation across the global aviation industry. The airline’s emphasis on sustainability and efficiency mirrors the growing recognition that long-term competitiveness depends on reducing environmental impact while enhancing customer experience. As climate policy and carbon regulation evolve rapidly, airlines with modern, fuel-efficient fleets will have a distinct advantage in meeting regulatory requirements and consumer expectations for greener travel.

In addition, fleet modernization provides the foundation for technological integration, including advanced digital maintenance systems, data-driven operational optimization, and enhanced connectivity. The A350 and A330neo families are equipped with intelligent monitoring systems that enable predictive maintenance and optimize aircraft performance, further reducing downtime and cost inefficiencies. As such, Etihad’s investment serves as a model of forward-thinking fleet planning grounded in both technological sophistication and economic prudence.

Etihad Airways’ latest fleet expansion marks a defining moment in the airline’s strategic evolution and underscores its commitment to sustainable growth, innovation, and excellence in global aviation. By acquiring state-of-the-art Airbus A330neo, A350-1000, and A350F aircraft, the airline is not merely increasing its fleet size—it is shaping the operational and environmental blueprint for the next generation of air travel.

The decision reinforces Etihad’s reputation as an industry leader that harmonizes economic viability with ecological responsibility, technological progress with passenger comfort, and international collaboration with national ambition. As the world’s aviation industry moves toward a more sustainable and integrated future, Etihad Airways’ actions at the Dubai Airshow stand as a testament to the power of visionary investment and global partnership in defining the trajectory of modern aviation.",https://www.iadb.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/etihad_airways_order_a330neo_a350_and_a350f_aircraft_0-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-11-18 16:56:37.399724

The airlines agreed they will not claim that paying extra to fund climate protection projects or the use of alternative aviation fuels can directly neutralize or reduce emissions on an individual flight. In addition, the airlines committed to tighter substantiation, clearer disclosures, and more transparent CO₂ calculators, particularly as they relate to their use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). National consumer authorities will monitor implementation and may enforce against carriers that fall short.

Although the Commission’s action targets EU airlines, U.S. airlines should review their marketing in the EU accordingly. In addition, the EU's action provides important insight into how EU authorities view environmental marketing claims more generally. Companies in other sectors should review their environmental marketing claims in light of this action, particularly if they have programs that give consumers the option to pay extra fees to fund the use of alternative fuels or support projects that offset emissions.

Legal Framework & Enforcement Posture

The Commission’s announcement follows a coordinated review by the Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Network, a network of authorities responsible for enforcing EU consumer protection laws. The CPC Network can take action under the Consumer Protection Regulation to address cross-border issues at the EU level in coordination with the Commission.

In addition to announcing the commitments from the 21 airlines subject to the review, the Commission also published a table tracking each airline’s commitments and timelines; authorities will verify timely implementation and pursue enforcement, if needed. To ensure fair competition and a level playing field in the aviation industry, the Commission’s announcement states that the CPC Network will also assess the practices of other airlines operating in the Single Market, and, where necessary, require the same commitments.

The CPC's action stemmed from an alert filed by BEUC (representing consumer organizations across the EU) in June 2023, pursuant to the Consumer Protection Regulation, alleging that 17 European airlines misled consumers by claiming ""green fees"" would render their flights sustainable and, more broadly, by implying ""flying is sustainable."" The complaint alleged that these claims constitute infringements of Directive 2005/29/EC (the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive - UCPD).

The UCPD harmonizes national laws governing business-to-consumer practices in the internal market and prohibits unfair commercial practices (Article 5), misleading actions (Article 6), and misleading omissions (Article 7). The European Commission’s Guidance Notice on the interpretation and application of the UCPD, though not legally binding, is intended to clarify and facilitate its proper application, and includes guidance on which environmental claims may be considered misleading.

What the 21 Airlines Committed to Change

Clarify that a specific flight’s CO₂ emissions cannot be neutralized, offset, or directly reduced by optional passenger payments for climate projects or alternative fuels.

Use “sustainable aviation fuel” (SAF) terminology only with appropriate clarifications and substantiation.

Avoid vague “green” language or implicit environmental claims.

Provide more detail when stating future climate goals (e.g., net-zero): include timelines, achievable steps, and the types of emissions covered.

Display CO₂ calculations clearly and transparently.

Support claims with sufficient scientific evidence.

Why This Matters in Aviation and Beyond

Although this example targets airlines, it signals how EU enforcers expect environmental marketing to be framed across sectors:

Claims that payment of fees will render products/services “Carbon-Neutral” or “Sustainable” Require Rigorous Clarification and Substantiation. The CPC’s scrutiny of pay-to-offset schemes may serve as a warning to other industries that sell add-ons implying immediate neutrality.

SAF and similar “transition” claims need precise context. Claims about cleaner inputs (e.g., SAF) should avoid implying one-for-one emission reductions for a specific transaction and must be properly qualified.

Aspirational goals must be anchored in plans. Claims regarding net-zero or carbon-neutral goals should include timelines, milestones, scope clarity (Scopes 1–3), and methodologies.

CO₂ calculators may be perceived as marketing claims. If you publish route- or product-level emissions figures, expect scrutiny of assumptions, data sources, and presentation.

EU coordination is accelerating. This airline action follows earlier EU-level probes and national rulings that have tightened the bar on “sustainable flight” messaging.

Practical Next Steps For EU-facing Marketers

Inventory – and revise if appropriate – green claims and map each to evidence (testing or internationally recognized methodologies), consistent with UCPD guidance and the evolving landscape of green marketing law at the EU-level (e.g., the Empowering Consumers Directive and the pending Green Claims Directive) and member-state level.

Avoid using vague buzzwords (“eco-friendly,” “green,” “sustainable”) unless defined and substantiated, in alignment with EU law.

Train relevant internal teams (e.g., marketing, sustainability, and legal) on EU marketing laws, guidance, and prior decisions affecting green marketing claims and set up pre-clearance for sustainability messaging.

Continue to closely monitor the rapidly evolving legal and policy developments in green marketing, not just in the EU but in other jurisdictions as well. (see, e.g., Canada Issues Guidelines on Civil Greenwashing Claims One Year After Amendments to the Competition Act).

Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines are investing in the future of the communities we serve by partnering with Mountain Towns 2030 (MT2030).



Earlier this year, we became a major sponsor of the annual MT2030 Climate Summit to launch the MT2030 Elevate Scholarship, a program designed to remove financial barriers for community leaders eager to participate in the three-day event.

In the heart of America’s mountain towns — where alpine trails meet bluebird skies — communities are facing the growing challenges of climate change. These towns, often nestled in remote, high-altitude regions, are particularly vulnerable to environmental shifts and have become increasingly susceptible to droughts, wildfires, avalanches and ecological degradation.

Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines are investing in the future of the communities we serve by partnering with Mountain Towns 2030 (MT2030), a nonprofit that empowers a movement of mountain communities committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2030.

Earlier this year, we became a major sponsor of the annual MT2030 Climate Summit to launch the MT2030 Elevate Scholarship, a program designed to remove financial barriers for community leaders eager to participate in the three-day event. Four scholarship recipients from California and Washington were selected to attend the October gathering, hosted in Breckenridge, Colo., and flown on Alaska Airlines. The group joined hundreds of industry professionals and stakeholders in conversations around complex climate challenges and solutions.

We hosted more than 600 attendees from 61 mountain communities and 37 ski resorts, with 118 speakers leading 49 sessions across a wide range of climate and sustainability topics. Our 2025 Summit was an overwhelming success, and we couldn’t have done it without Alaska Airlines’ partnership.”

Following the MT2030 Climate Summit, we caught up with scholarship recipient Michelle to hear her reflections on the experience and what it meant to her.

What do you do for your work? What challenges does your community face that you were looking for insight on at the MT2030 Climate Summit?

I do government relations and environmental affairs for Mammoth Mountain and June Mountain. Like many other communities, wildfire is a major threat to our area, and I was interested in seeing what others were doing and how, as a ski area, we could contribute to our community.

What was the most eye-opening moment or takeaway from the Summit?

It was great to see such a large group of like-minded individuals sharing their experiences and common goals. I participated in a Solutions Lab session, which was a presentation followed by an interactive exchange to explore actionable strategies and insights. I really enjoyed the TED talk-style presentations. The Summit gave me some ideas on ways to further develop and grow our mountains’ sustainability program.

What role do you think travelers play in shaping the future of climate-resilient communities?

I think travelers play a big role in the future of climate-resilient communities. Their sustainable demands and preferences can drive the investment of our communities and resorts. An example would be electric vehicles — the increase in visitors driving EVs requires the installation of more charging stations. Travelers can also create new challenges in our communities by over-utilizing resources or not traveling responsibly. Being mindful of your impact while exploring is critical.

What’s something you learned at the summit that mountain adventure travelers should be aware of and that you’re excited to bring home?

That communities are stronger when businesses and local governments work together toward common sustainability goals. The partnership can create innovative ideas and a more climate-resilient plan for the future.

It sees LanzaJet take its alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) technology from the lab to a commercial setting for the first time.

After 15 years of research and development, the company has reached a hugely significant milestone in its journey.

The team confirmed that it has successfully produced its first round of jet fuel using ethanol at its Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Soperton, Georgia.

It sees LanzaJet take its alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) technology from the lab to a commercial setting for the first time.

The fuel produced in Georgia is fully compatible with existing aircraft technology, meaning it can be 'dropped in' as a direct replacement for carbon-heavy jet fuels. This could go a long way towards shrinking the carbon footprints of airlines.

What's more, LanzaJet's achievement is the very first time that a non-oil-based renewable solution of this nature has reached commercial production levels, with most SAFs generally being made using a kind of bio-oil.

How LanzaJet is overcoming feedstock challenges

Industry analysts have been warning that SAF made using Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) is approaching a plateau in terms of the levels of feedstock available. As such, LanzaJet's alcohol-based solution represents a sound alternative.

The firm's proprietary technology looks to bypass this bottleneck. The process LanzaJet uses harnesses some widely available ethanol feedstocks, including agricultural residues and municipal solid waste.

By shifting focus to ethanol, the technology has the potential to open pathways for waste sources and recycled carbon to contribute to the aviation energy mix.

Flyn van Ewijk, Regional Director for APAC at LanzaJet, says: ""Overnight we shared news that LanzaJet had made history: producing jet fuel from ethanol at the world's first commercial scale plant.

""This moment is not only hugely significant for the LanzaJet family – the culmination of 15 years of research and development, collaboration, investment and scale-up – but also for our industry as it marks the next wave of SAF technology to reach commercial readiness in nearly a decade.""

LanzaJet’s plan to scale sustainable aviation fuel

LanzaJet describes its work in Soperton as a ""first-of-its-kind"" integrated solution.

It incorporates Technip Energies’ Hummingbird Ethanol-to-Ethylene solution alongside oligomerisation technology jointly developed by LanzaTech and the US Department of Energy.

Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet, has taken pains to emphasise the role collaboration has played in the company's recent achievements.

“Today proves what happens when you bring together innovation, resilience, ingenuity, and teamwork to think big and develop a new industry, overcome challenges, and enable global growth,” he says.

“We’re now in a unique position with technology and operational know-how to shape this global industry in the decade ahead.”

Scaling the use of sustainable aviation and alternative fuels forms a significant part of DHL’s Sustainability Roadmap.
Travis Cobb, EVP Global Operations and Aviation at DHL Express, said: “This agreement with Phillips 66 is a significant milestone for DHL Express as we work towards our sustainability goals.
Brian Mandell, EVP Marketing and Commercial at Phillips 66, said: “This agreement between Phillips 66 and DHL demonstrates our shared commitment to SAF market leadership and credible action in the growing SAF industry.
Through our global renewable fuel business, we are committed to supporting DHL and our customers in achieving their decarbonization goals.”","Logistics giant DHL Group announced a new agreement with U.S.-based energy products manufacturer Phillips 66 for the purchase of more than 240,000 metric tons (314 million liters) of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), to be delivered to U.S. airports over three years.

The deal marks one of the largest SAF agreements by a U.S. producer to date, and is anticipated to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by approximately 737,000 metric tons compared to conventional jet fuel, according to DHL.

Scaling the use of sustainable aviation and alternative fuels forms a significant part of DHL’s Sustainability Roadmap. Launched in 2021, the roadmap included plans to invest €7 billion over ten years in measures to reduce its CO2 emissions, with a focus on the expansion of a zero-emissions fleet, alternative aviation fuels, and climate-neutral buildings. In addition to its 2050 net zero goal, DHL also has interim targets to increase the share of more sustainable fuels across all transportation modes to more than 30%, and to electrify two-thirds of last-mile delivery vehicles by 2030.

In addition to supporting DHL’s sustainability goals, the new agreement is expected to contribute significantly to the company’s carbon “insetting” GoGreen Plus service, which enables customers to reduce their Scope 3 GHG emissions using SAF.

Travis Cobb, EVP Global Operations and Aviation at DHL Express, said:

“This agreement with Phillips 66 is a significant milestone for DHL Express as we work towards our sustainability goals. By securing a reliable supply of SAF, we are not only reducing our carbon emissions – and those within our customers’ supply chains – but also setting a precedent for the logistics and air cargo industries in the U.S.”

Under the new agreement, Phillips 66 will deliver SAF to DHL Express from the energy company’s Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex in California. Phillips 66 announced in 2022 that it planned to convert its oil refinery in Rodeo to process only renewable feedstocks, with the facility no longer processing crude oil and instead using waste oils, fats, greases and vegetable oils instead to produce 800 million gallons per year (over 50,000 barrels per day) of renewable transportation fuels, including renewable diesel, renewable gasoline and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). The company announced the completion of the conversion last year. The complex is now one of the largest renewable fuel facilities in the world, and has an SAF production capacity of 150 million gallons per year.

The SAF will be delivered primarily to Los Angeles International Airport, with future intended deliveries to other West Coast airports where DHL maintains operations.

Brian Mandell, EVP Marketing and Commercial at Phillips 66, said:
