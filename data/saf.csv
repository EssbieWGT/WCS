From cutting deadly air pollution near airports to boosting long-term decarbonization, two complementary policy tools offer a clear path forward for cleaner skies.

Addressing climate and air pollution from global aviation has never been more urgent. If aviation were a country, it would be one of the world’s top 10 sources of climate pollution – and demand for air travel is growing. Fortunately, two strategies – one focused on strengthening international aviation’s carbon price signal and broadening its scope, and the other on cleaning up jet fuel itself – offer powerful, complementary paths forward.

Smarter jet fuel policies and carbon markets can power cleaner aviation Share on X

The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation and targeted jet fuel regulation can work hand-in-hand to deliver near-term air quality improvements while driving long-term climate progress. With smart policy design, both approaches could be game changers.

This is the thesis of two EDF articles published last month in the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Environment Report, an agenda-setting publication that’s only issued every three years by the ICAO Secretariat. It’s an opportunity for aviation industry, advocates and other stakeholders to showcase the most pressing environmental issues.Below is a summary of EDF’s articles, but if you’d like to dive deeper you can read the full versions here and here.

CORSIA: A global framework that needs integrity to deliver

CORSIA, established by ICAO in 2016, is the world’s first sector-specific global carbon offset program. It caps emissions from international flights and requires participating airlines to offset any growth above 2019 levels using either high-quality carbon credits or low-carbon jet fuels certified as “CORSIA Eligible Fuels.”

As it enters its first operational phase (2024–2026), CORSIA has the potential to prevent up to 1.5 billion tons of CO₂ emissions by 2035. But to fulfill this promise, its integrity must be safeguarded. That means ensuring that every offset credit and alternative fuel delivers genuine, verifiable climate benefits — and that emissions aren’t “double counted” by both airlines and national governments under the Paris Agreement.

The risks of weak rules are real. If the market is flooded with low-integrity offsets or if sustainable aviation fuel claims are made without proper tracking, the environmental value of CORSIA could be undermined. Improved monitoring, reporting, and verification systems, coupled with formal government attestations to avoid double claiming of eligible fuels, could significantly enhance transparency and trust in the system.

Crucially, CORSIA must evolve beyond its current carbon-only focus. Non-CO2 effects from aviation — including contrail-induced global warming — are significant and require policy attention. Non-CO2 effects could be as great, or even twice as great, as those from CO2 alone when expressed in terms of effective radiative forcing. In the long term, CORSIA should help create meaningful price signals for the full range of aviation climate impacts, incentivizing innovation across aircraft design, operations and sustainable fuel production.

Jet fuel regulation: An immediate opportunity for health and climate

While CORSIA lays the groundwork for long-term decarbonization, a separate opportunity could deliver big wins today: regulating the aromatic and sulfur content of jet fuel.

Current jet fuels contain up to 25% aromatic hydrocarbons and significant levels of sulfur. These ingredients generate fine particulate matter (PM2.5) during combustion — pollution that not only has an indirect net warming effect, but also poses serious risks to public health, including respiratory and cardiovascular problems, and even premature death. A recent EDF study found that between 5.8 million and 16 million Americans are at risk for exposure to PM 2.5 from aviation in the vicinity of airports.

Evidence shows that reducing aromatic and sulfur content in jet fuel can significantly cut PM2.5 emissions. In blended fuels with a high share of synthetic, sulfur-free components, reductions of 50–70% in particulate emissions under certain conditions. These gains are especially pronounced during takeoff, taxiing and landing — around airports.

Public health experts are increasingly concerned about aviation-attributable PM2.5. Globally, these emissions are linked to more than 21,000 premature deaths each year. A recent reevaluation of earlier studies suggests aviation’s overall air quality impacts may be substantially greater than previously estimated. And in countries with heavy air traffic, like China, the annual toll from aviation-related PM pollution could be as high as 67,000 lives.

Cleaner fuels mean less PM 2.5, fewer contrails and a smaller overall climate footprint.

The policy path is clear: ICAO could establish international standards limiting aromatic and sulfur levels in jet fuel to levels compatible with existing safety and performance standards, much as countries already regulate diesel fuel for ground transportation. While most road diesel is now “ultra-low sulfur,” aviation fuel remains largely unregulated on these dimensions. ICAO is uniquely positioned to harmonize standards globally and maximize reductions.

And the economic case is strong. Cleaner jet fuel could raise fuel costs by just 2% or less — a marginal increase that equates to less than half a percent of operating costs for airlines. Moreover, cleaner fuels offer higher energy density, which could improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions further.

A call-to-action

The window for action is now. Global aviation emissions are rising, and the decisions made in the next few years will shape the sector’s impact for decades. Smart, targeted investments in policy design, regulatory development, and high-integrity market infrastructure can help bend the curve toward cleaner skies.

Together, these steps can reduce pollution, protect lives and bring the aviation sector closer to its long-overdue climate course correction.

Funding will be crucial in supporting the green fuels and technologies of the future, so the UK can clean up its sea travel and trade.

Awarded from the sixth round of the Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition (CMDC), successful companies will be given a share of funding to support the development of clean maritime fuels and technologies such as ammonia, hydrogen, methanol, solar and electric.

Boosting economic growth with green fuels and technologies

Investment in green fuels not only supports the decarbonisation of shipping, helping cement the UK as a clean energy superpower, it also revitalises coastal communities by growing local economies and boosting jobs and skills.

CMDC has provided over £136m funding to date to 142 organisations, as part of the wider UK SHORE funding – the government’s flagship programme dedicated to decarbonising maritime – for over 300 organisations, including 250 SMEs.

Successful projects include the installation of electric chargepoint networks across ports, including at Aberdeen, the demonstration of an electric crew transfer vessel at Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm, and the demonstration of a green hydrogen shore power system at the port of Leith.

Maritime Minister Mike Kane said: “It’s so exciting to see investment in green fuels and technologies spurring on skills, innovation and manufacturing across the UK, delivering on Plan for Change missions to kickstart economic growth and become a clean energy superpower.”

High-tech innovations from industry

Minister Kane will meet with workers from the National Manufacturing Institute Scotland during his visit to Clydeport. The National Manufacturing Institute is looking to help Smart Green Shipping scale up the manufacturing of the FastRig windsail.

Built nearby in Glasgow, the FastRig is a high-tech wing sail which can be installed onto vessels, reducing fuel use and emissions by up to 40% per annum. The project received £3.3m from the third round of the CMDC and has now been successfully deployed at sea.

“Clean maritime is a vital part of a wider mission to decarbonise transport. Advanced manufacturing is critical to enable companies to scale up novel solutions that deliver emissions reductions and allow the creation of new jobs in these industries of the future,” stated Chris Courtney, CEO of the National Manufacturing Institute.

Advancing expertise in shipbuilding and manufacturing

During the Clydeport visit, the minister will meet with Peel Ports and local workers at Clydeport’s King George V Docks.

By delivering £3m of investment to support the growing demand for handling huge wind turbine components for the renewable energy sector, Clydeport is keeping Glasgow’s shipbuilding heritage and manufacturing expertise alive, equipping it to meet the modern-day needs of the sector.

“Our recent investment in road infrastructure at King George V Dock to accommodate growing demand for handling wind turbine components, and our ongoing transformative work at Hunterston PARC in Ayrshire to support the renewables sector, demonstrate our commitment to decarbonising supply chains and enabling the transition to a greener economy,” commented Jim McSporran, Port Director at Peel Ports Clydeport.

Research hub for clean maritime operations

Building on its commitment to clean up shipping and deliver on the UK’s climate ambitions, the UK is also delivering £3.85m to the Clean Maritime Research Hub.

Formed from a consortium of 13 universities across the UK, dedicated to conducting scientific research in clean maritime, the funding will enable the hub to continue its important research, and support the installation of a liquid hydrogen facility at Durham University.

The centre will develop the maritime sector’s understanding of the potential impact of liquid hydrogen – which is emission free – in the clean maritime transition.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2525711387.jpg,N,,2025-07-24 13:56:41.761656

Effect on Markets Many anticipate that the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, especially with changes made under the OBBBA, will increase demand for domestically sourced feedstocks.
While the 45Z tax credit is awarded to fuel producers, not directly to farmers, it incentivizes fuel producers to increase production of eligible fuels and thus purchase additional feedstocks, creating the potential for more stable demand and stronger prices for key commodities tied to eligible fuel production.","The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) made several important changes to the Clean Fuel Production Credit (45Z). Most notably, it extended the credit through 2029, providing biofuels producers with an additional two years of investment beyond the original 2027 expiration date. While the credit still has no requirements to pass through any of the credit to farmers and feedstock producers, the OBBBA clarified key provisions related to feedstock eligibility, emissions measurement and credit calculation, which are especially relevant for U.S. farmers. This Market Intel analyzes what the changes to 45Z mean for farmers.

The Evolution of 45Z

The 45Z credit was established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 to encourage domestic production of low-emission fuels. It is not tied to a specific type of fuel or production technology; it instead bases eligibility solely on a fuel’s ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional petroleum-based fuels. This credit was created to consolidate separate tax credits for biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The 45Z credit applies to fuel produced after Dec. 31, 2024, and was originally set to expire at the end of 2027. The OBBBA extended the credit to fuel sold by Dec. 31, 2029.

The 45Z tax credit is dependent on how much the eligible fuel reduces emissions and is claimed by biofuel producers. The emissions from feedstock production through fuel combustion is estimated using the U.S. Department of Energy 45ZCF-GREET (Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Technologies) Model. The GREET model consolidates all of the greenhouse gas emissions of each step of the biofuels supply chain, dependent on things like form of transportation and farming practices, into a specific emission rate for a gallon of fuel. This emission rate becomes your carbon intensity (CI) score; the lower the CI score, the higher the tax credit. To qualify, fuels must produce less than 50 kilograms of carbon dioxide per unit of energy – half of traditional petroleum products – for a base credit of 20 cents per gallon. The fuels that reduce emissions the most can earn biofuel producers up to $1 per gallon in 45Z tax credits.

GREET scores can be lowered in various ways, including on how the feedstock was produced. For example, the standard CI score for corn is 29.1. This means traditionally produced corn as a feedstock would largely not reduce emissions enough to qualify for 45Z credits. However, by utilizing conservation methods like no-till, cover cropping or high-efficiency fertilizers that affect carbon sequestration and release from soils, you can lower the CI score. While the GREET model was updated in January 2025, the OBBBA now requires the model to be adjusted again to exclude emissions from indirect land use change (ILUC)– the conversion of grassland, forestland, etc. to cropland to produce biofuels feedstock.

OBBBA also clarified that, to qualify for the 45Z credit, eligible fuels must be produced by American-controlled firms using feedstocks sourced from North America (the United States, Mexico or Canada). This change supports a broad range of agricultural feedstocks, including corn, soybeans and other biomass-based materials, expanding market opportunities for farmers while reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The amendment was designed to prevent large imports of used cooking oil (UCO), which had more favorable carbon intensity scores as it is considered a waste product with minimal lifecycle emissions. There was also increasing scrutiny over the possibility of fraud in imported feedstocks, as some UCO may be blended with virgin oils and falsely labeled as waste to qualify for higher credits.

The OBBBA also amended 45Z and Section 6426(k) to ensure that sustainable aviation fuel producers do not receive overlapping credits and removed premiums in the credit for SAF. Before passage of OBBBA, SAF could receive an extra 75 cents per unit of carbon reduced compared to other clean fuels. Lastly, the legislation increased credits for small producers to encourage blending capacity increase.

Effect on Markets

Many anticipate that the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, especially with changes made under the OBBBA, will increase demand for domestically sourced feedstocks. While the 45Z tax credit is awarded to fuel producers, not directly to farmers, it incentivizes fuel producers to increase production of eligible fuels and thus purchase additional feedstocks, creating the potential for more stable demand and stronger prices for key commodities tied to eligible fuel production.

Renewable fuels are already a major source of demand for U.S. agriculture, particularly for corn and soybeans. USDA projects that 35% of U.S. corn production will be used for ethanol in 2025. Additionally, corn oil can be used in biodiesel production. At the same time, more than 50% of domestically produced soybean oil is expected to go into biofuels, including biodiesel and renewable diesel.

45Z Challenges

With the changes to 45Z in the OBBBA, the Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) must now rewrite the regulations and guidance for qualifying fuels. This also requires USDA to finalize (or change) the interim technical guideline for “climate-smart” practices that lower CI scores for biofuels feedstocks. USDA has largely turned away from labeling conservation practices as “climate-smart.” In January, the Office of the Chief Economist at USDA released a list of 24 possible conservation practices or combinations of practices that could lower GREET scores for biofuels. Notably, they removed the previous requirements for 40B SAF tax credits that required farmers to conduct “bundles”, set combinations, of conservation practices, which added to the complexity of qualifying for biofuels credits and vastly limiting the eligible feedstocks. However, there is still time for the USDA to alter the eligible emissions-reducing practices.

It is also important to reiterate that there is no requirement for biofuels producers to pass any of their earnings from 45Z on to the farmers who produced their feedstocks. With rising global row crop production and low-profit margins creating uncertain market conditions for farmers, additional premiums from eligible biofuel feedstock sales can make or break farm balance sheets. However, the conservation practices required to sell crops as feedstock require significant upfront financial investments if farmers are not already utilizing them. Many factors impact what conservation practices are feasible in different regions and cropping systems. Cover crops are used on less than 5% of cropland, while, reduced tillage and no-till are used on 25% and 28% of cropland, respectively. The percent of land using a combination of any is likely also lower. And in the current down crop economy, it is difficult for crop farmers to invest in new machinery and inputs that would allow more cropland to use these needed feedstock conservation practices. If biofuels producers hope farmers continue to utilize and grow these practices on farms, they must provide significant premiums for feedstocks. Without guarantees that their investments will be returned through crop premiums or credit passthroughs, it will likely be slow going to grow eligible feedstock acres, particularly with only four years before 45Z faces expiration again.

Conclusion

Even with the OBBBA changes to 45Z eligibility, there are still many needed clarifications before the credit can be used. In addition, the uncertainty on whether farmers will be compensated for lowering emissions of feedstocks and downstream biofuels may make it difficult to truly maximize the growth of biofuels, as the 45Z credit was created to do.

Regardless, biofuels producers will likely begin planning how to take advantage of this extended tax credit. If federal agencies quickly provide workable guidance for 45Z, farmers can plan for future crop years to take advantage of the expanding markets for biofuels. When bumper crops are pushing down crop prices, increasing market demand is crucial for supporting crop prices and farm income. 45Z and biofuels production, particularly with the OBBBA investments in domestic feedstocks, represents a step forward in encouraging demand for major American crops. But without clear implementation and a fair path for farmers to benefit, the full potential of the credit may fall short.",https://www.fb.org/imgz/Analysis/MarketIntel/MI-Graphics/_socialwFacebook/242960/MI_45Z_16x9.jpg,N,,2025-07-24 12:56:21.467656

The announcement, made by both companies, brings Avolon’s total Airbus order book to 413 aircraft, highlighting its growing role in shaping the future of fuel-efficient aviation.

A Fleet Reboot Built on Confidence

Avolon’s huge order isn’t just about numbers; it’s a statement. With 264 A321neo and 79 A330-900 now on the way, the Dublin-based lessor is betting on fuel-efficient, versatile jets that work well for both short and long-haul routes.

Andy Cronin, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Avolon, emphasized:

“This order demonstrates our strong confidence in the long‑term demand for new aircraft. Our scale and balance sheet position us to support our airline customers’ expansion and replacement needs into the next decade.”

And Benoît de Saint‑Exupéry, Airbus EVP Sales, added:

“Lessors are excellent barometers… this endorsement illustrates the strong attractiveness (…) covering the market space from domestic to long haul routes.”

Aircraft Highlights

A330neo: Powered by Rolls‑Royce Trent 7000 engines, offering a 7,200 nm (13,300 km) range and cutting fuel burn and CO₂ emissions by up to 25%. According to Airbus, it also features the revamped Airspace cabin, which offers enhanced passenger comfort, lighting, and connectivity.

A321neo: The star of Airbus’s single-aisle family, boasting a 20% fuel efficiency improvement, 50% noise reduction, and up to 244 seats with a 7,400 km reach, makes it a top pick for high-density routes

Both models currently support up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with Airbus targeting 100% compliance by 2030

Timing & Strategic Context

Deliveries are scheduled to take place between 2026 and 2033, allowing Avolon to gradually introduce these new jets as older aircraft are retired and demand continues to rise. This aligns perfectly with the firm's robust Q2 2025 performance, which saw net income climb 36% to US$143 million, and an owned, managed, and committed fleet reaching 1,166 aircraft, including 532 new-tech jets.

Environmental Investment

Avolon also stated earlier that it’s on track to have 75% of its fleet comprised of new-technology, fuel-efficient aircraft by 2025, a clear indication of its shift toward lower-emission flying. The company is also aiming for net-zero carbon emissions in its operations, showing its dedication to leading the sustainability space.

While it hasn’t broken down exact numbers in the order book, this direction lines up with its message that the majority of upcoming deliveries are next-gen, environmentally friendlier jets.

Bottom Line

Lessors like Avolon often act as early indicators of where airline strategies are headed. This latest order sends a strong message on two fronts:

Sustained global demand for fuel‑efficient, versatile aircraft is expected to stay high as airlines prioritize carbon cuts and operational efficiency.

Avolon is doubling down on balance‑sheet strength to offer airlines both new aircraft and flexible delivery options for the next decade.

With OEMs still working through post-pandemic supply chain challenges, Avolon’s strong order book, anchored by Airbus and Boeing, gives it the flexibility to move faster than most and meet demand without being held up.

What to Watch Next

Conversion into leases: Which airlines will take up the delivery slots, especially for the A330neos?

Shareholder vote: The Transaction requires approval from Bohai Leasing by the end of August.

Sustainability edge: Will airlines prioritize lessors with cleaner offerings as emissions regulation becomes stricter?

This latest order not only reinforces Avolon’s long-standing partnership with Airbus but also highlights its growing role in the global shift toward cleaner, more efficient fleets, while giving it the scale and flexibility to support airlines well into the next decade.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c26eeea7cdaa706d97a75c/68823aa89f5a1cd4c92125ee_Avolon%20A321neo%20A330neo.jpg,N,,2025-07-24 11:56:30.274356

(NASDAQ: GEVO) expands in the carbon market by selling its first carbon removal credits. A global financial and tech company purchased Puro.earth-certified CO₂ Removal Certificates (CORCs) to offset corporate travel emissions and is ready to retire immediately. These CORCs promise real and permanent CO₂ removal from the atmosphere. They also help buyers achieve their climate goals with measurable and trustworthy results.

The company’s innovative technology makes it a pioneer in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable gasoline, chemicals, and materials with low-carbon methods. Notably, it operates one of the largest dairy-based Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) facilities in the U.S. These efforts support a clean energy future and also benefit farming communities.

Gevo: Pioneering Carbon Removals with Verified Results

The press release highlights that Gevo’s CORCs provide genuine carbon abatement. Each credit corresponds to actual tons of CO₂ removed through Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). With these credits ready for retirement, buyers can claim climate benefits right away.

This sale addresses the growing demand for reliable, verifiable carbon removals. As companies want to reduce their carbon footprints, Gevo’s CORCs will provide a strong method to offset emissions, particularly from hard-to-reduce sources like travel.

The next-generation energy company is focused on renewable fuels and chemicals. Its mission has three main goals: energy security, carbon reduction, and rural economic growth.

Significantly, in Q1, Gevo recorded over 100,000 metric tons of carbon abatement, now viewed as a marketable product. This includes captured and sequestered carbon, plus emissions avoided from using low-carbon fuels.

Alex Clayton, Chief Business Development Officer for Gevo, says,

“These are real sales of credits for carbon dioxide removal that are being generated right now. Customers should feel confident in the CORCs we provide due to the rigor Gevo and Puro.earth are putting into every step of the process. We previously said that after our purchase of Gevo North Dakota that we would be selling carbon and that’s what we’re doing.”

North Dakota Ethanol Facility: A Hub for Clean Energy and Carbon Capture

Gevo’s North Dakota ethanol production facility plays a crucial role in capturing and storing CO₂. This plant produces 65 million gallons of low-carbon ethanol annually from 500 acres. Its clean fuels meet demand in areas with strict emissions targets, like Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Alberta.

Besides ethanol, the facility generates over 200,000 tons annually of co-products, such as distillers’ grains and vegetable oils, supporting a circular economy.

Permanent CO₂ Storage with Massive Potential

Gevo North Dakota has a Class VI CCS well and lease rights for 5,800 acres in the Broom Creek geological formation. This formation can store up to 1 million metric tons of CO₂ each year. Currently, it sequesters about 180,000 metric tons per year, but Gevo aims to significantly increase this amount.

The geology allows carbon to stay underground for over 1,000 years, meeting top permanence standards in the carbon removal market. With ample pore space and wellhead capacity, the facility offers long-term growth for sequestered carbon-based credits.

As already mentioned, these CORCs are certified under Puro.earth’s strict standards, ensuring they meet key criteria for permanence, additionality, and traceability. The credits are available now and can be retired immediately for verified decarbonization today—not decades from now.

Fueling the Future with Renewable Products

Gevo’s North Dakota ethanol facility is part of a bigger vision. Ethanol serves as the feedstock for many of Gevo’s downstream products, including alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) fuels and renewable chemicals. These drop-in fuels fit directly into existing infrastructure, speeding up the shift to clean energy.

By producing renewable fuel from regeneratively grown crops, Gevo seeks to change agricultural practices while enhancing the global food supply. The company supports low-carbon farming methods, sourcing feedstocks from sustainable farmers.

Instead of choosing between food or fuel, Gevo uses a “nutrition-first approach”—extracting proteins for food and using starch for fuel. This system maximizes crop value and supports health for both people and the environment.

A Systems Approach to Sustainability

Gevo’s strategy stands out due to its “systems thinking” model. Everything—from feedstock sourcing to production and carbon tracking—is designed for efficiency and transparency. It provides end-to-end monitoring through its Verity subsidiary. This ensures accurate measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) of sustainability attributes across the supply chain.

This focus on carbon intensity and life cycle impact gives the SAF giant a competitive edge in renewable energy. It also bolsters rural economies by creating jobs, enhancing infrastructure, and attracting long-term investments.

Gevo Leads the Shift: Carbon Capture as a Market Opportunity

The first sale of CORCs is a big step for Gevo. However, it’s just the beginning. The company aims to grow its CCS operations and increase carbon abatement. With strong geological resources, modern infrastructure, and proven technology, it is set to lead in carbon removal and clean fuels.

Traditionally, CO₂ has been seen as waste or used in industries like enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Gevo captures biogenic CO₂ from its operations and then stores the gas underground, keeping it safe and harmless. This method prevents emissions and turns carbon into a valuable asset through CORCs.

As per industry reports, right now, North America and Europe lead the world in CCS development. Together, they make up about 80% of all upcoming capture and storage capacity. However, other regions are beginning to catch up.

And Gevo is now helping companies offset emissions by monetizing permanent CO₂ removal. This creates a practical market solution and supports clean energy production in the U.S.

In conclusion, Gevo’s entry into the carbon removal market with CORCs underscores its commitment to decarbonization and innovation. By linking renewable fuels with certified carbon capture, Gevo delivers a reliable solution that supports both climate goals and community growth.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2342984919.jpg,N,,2025-07-24 11:56:37.619441

The facility is expected to start production by year-end with a capacity of about 61 million gallons a year, the three companies said in a joint statement.

Houston, Texas-based Par Pacific and Japanese companies Mitsubishi and ENEOS will form a joint venture called Hawaii Renewables LLC for the project.

ENEOS and Mitsubishi will create Alohi Renewable Energy LLC, which will buy a 36.5 percent stake in Hawaii Renewables for $100 million in cash. Par Pacific will retain majority ownership and lead the project’s execution and operation.

“Once fully operational, Hawaii Renewables will be the state’s largest renewable fuels manufacturing facility and is expected to produce approximately 61 million gallons per year of renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, renewable naphtha and low-carbon liquified petroleum gases”, the companies said.

The plant will initially produce up to 60 percent SAF with flexibility to process different feedstocks and “shift yields to RD based on market conditions”, they said.

“The project’s attractive capital cost, along with its operating and distribution cost advantages, are key differentiators”, the companies said.

“Hawaii Renewables will leverage Par Pacific's existing refining and logistics infrastructure and Lutros LLC’s new and advantaged pretreatment technology”.

Par Pacific says it owns and operates 219,000 barrels per day of refining capacity across four sites in Hawaii, the Pacific Northwest and the Rockies. It also has 13 million barrels of storage capacity, as well as marine, rail, rack and pipeline assets.

The Hawaii renewable fuels plant will have access to Mitsubishi’s Petro-Diamond Inc. Terminal in Long Beach, California.

“As Japan's leading energy company, ENEOS will strengthen the partnership by leveraging its historical success in fuel refining and trading across Asia-Pacific and North America”, the statement said.

Par Pacific president and chief executive Will Monteleone said, “Creating the Hawaii Renewables joint venture brings together the best of our three organizations and yields additional scale and expertise across feedstock origination, commercial optimization, and market access throughout the Pacific Basin”.

The establishment of the joint venture requires regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, the companies said.

The Hawaii project is one of two SAF projects that the United States Energy Information Administration expects to come onstream in the country this year, the other being the New Rise Reno plant in Nevada.

The Reno plant started operation early 2025 with a nameplate capacity of 38 million gallons a year.

The owner, which rebranded to XCF Global Inc. after merging with Focus Impact BH3 Acquisition Co., announced earlier this month an investment plan of nearly $1 billion over the next three years to build a global SAF production portfolio.

Four of the projects under the plan are in the U.S., including the Reno plant. The three projects still to be built is planned to each have a capacity of 40 million gallons per annum.

New Rise Reno 2 is planned to be completed 2027. Another project in Ft. Myers, Florida, will be built on a site with access to port infrastructure and is expected to be completed 2028. The third, also targeted for start-up 2028, will rise in Wilson, North Carolina, eyeing East Coast markets.

Microsoft Corp. is partnering with Sublime Systems to reduce its indirect greenhouse gas emissions through a first-of-a-kind deal to buy low-carbon cement products from the startup.

Under the contract, Microsoft can purchase up to 622,500 metric tons of Sublime’s cement over a period of six to nine years. Microsoft can claim the carbon reductions associated with that cement in its own emissions accounting, even if it doesn’t use the material itself. If Microsoft passes on buying the product, the Somerville, Massachusetts-based Sublime can sell it to local buyers but the software giant still gets to claim the carbon savings.

Sublime uses an electrochemical process that eliminates limestone, which is cement’s main ingredient and releases carbon dioxide when it’s heated up and broken down.

Microsoft’s push to build more data centers supporting artificial intelligence has driven the company further away from its goal of becoming carbon-negative by 2030. That AI expansion has helped boost the tech giant’s emissions by 30% since 2020. More than 96% of the company’s emissions are Scope 3, or indirect, and materials like cement used in data center construction make up a big share of them.

It’s Microsoft’s first time doing a deal like this for building materials, though the company and others have used the same approach for sustainable aviation fuel and renewable energy. Called an environmental attribute certificate, it allows the purchasing company to make a sustainability claim based on environmentally friendly goods – like clean jet fuel, renewable electricity or low-carbon cement – that it didn’t use directly. But these certificates often promise more than they deliver, research shows.

“Our priority, first and foremost, is always buying and installing low-carbon materials physically that are already on the market today,” said Katie Ross, Microsoft’s director of carbon reduction strategy and market development. “But the challenge is they don’t exist at the scale or in all of the locations that we need to procure today.”

The companies declined to say how much the deal is worth.

The challenges of green cement

It’s not just a Microsoft problem. Although cement accounts for about 8% of global emissions, it’s hard to decarbonize partly because construction is a risk-averse industry with thin margins and high safety standards, according to Nik Sawe, a senior policy analyst in the industry program at Energy Innovation Policy and Technology LLC, an energy and climate think tank. That means construction companies have been reluctant to take up cement alternatives developed by startups, which are cleaner but also currently more expensive and untested in the real world.

At its 250-ton-per-year pilot plant in Somerville, Sublime has reduced emissions by 90% compared to traditional cement, according to Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder Leah Ellis. Sublime will start delivering on its deal with Microsoft when its first 30,000-ton commercial plant is operational. It’s slated to be completed in 2027.

Cement is heavy, and transporting it over long distances doesn’t make sense economically, Ellis said. The deal allows Microsoft to support the scale-up of Sublime’s technology even if it doesn’t have a construction project near the startup’s plant, she added.

Do environmental attribute certificates work?

In the past, some of these certificates have supported renewable projects that would have been developed anyway, meaning they didn’t help bring additional wind and solar online as promised, studies show. Microsoft has said it plans to phase out its use of unbundled renewable energy certificates in future years.

If deals like the one the company signed with Sublime proliferate, the clean cement industry will need to prove that the certificates it is offering are verifiable and avoid carbon emissions that manufacturers would have generated otherwise, according to a 2024 report on structuring demand for lower-carbon materials co-published by RMI and Microsoft. That includes ensuring that the products’ environmental benefits aren’t double-counted, or claimed by multiple entities as a reduction on their emissions ledger.

“Checks must be in place along the way to increase confidence that every purchase of a certificate will deliver its expected outcome,” the report’s authors wrote.

For this deal with Microsoft, other customers who buy Sublime’s cement won’t be able to lay claim to its environmental benefits, Ellis said.

""Our sustainable aviation fuel sales increased close to 80% quarter on quarter, benefiting from additional SAF production capacity at our renewables refinery in Rotterdam,"" CEO Heikki Malinen said in a statement.

The rise in SAF sales drove the sales volume in Neste's renewable products unit to a new quarterly record of 1,096 thousand tonnes. The unit's sales volume margin fell 5% to $361 per ton, but exceeded analysts' forecast of $329 per tonne.

""We saw positive developments in the biofuel regulation both in the US and EU, largely supporting long-term renewables demand,"" Malinen, who joined the company last year, said.

Neste shares were up 15% as of 1000GMT. RBC analysts said in a research note that the second quarter was a ""key litmus test"" for Neste's new management, adding the results boded well for investor sentiment.

However, Malinen warned that the market environment was volatile and headwinds from global trade tensions were expected to continue.

Neste has been battling an excess supply in the renewable fuels market, pressuring its sales volumes and leading to a reduction of around 510 jobs globally earlier in 2025.

Although the group said it still expected its annual sales volumes to improve from 2024, it also forecast continuing oversupply in the renewable fuels market for the year.

Malinen told Reuters that he expects the oversupply to continue in 2026 or even beyond that, depending among others on the regulation process in the European Union.

Combined with weak demand and high input costs, oversupply had made Neste cut its forecast for the renewables sales margin three times in 2024.

Operation Northern Phoenix used the former Loring Air Force Base’s runways for the first run of its five-year aviation training effort.
The two aviation companies, whose names the authority is not yet releasing, would boost the authority’s plan to bring more aerospace jobs onto the former base.
“Due to the added attention that Operation Northern Phoenix has brought to Loring, there are two national aerospace companies that are looking at Loring as a potential home for their operations,” LDA President and CEO Jonathan Judkins said.
The Loring Air Museum and the LDA last year were at odds over the hangar’s future.","Thanks to a military training program that launched in May, two national aerospace companies could be coming to northern Maine.

Operation Northern Phoenix used the former Loring Air Force Base’s runways for the first run of its five-year aviation training effort. Word of that event spread in aviation circles, and the businesses reached out to the Loring Commerce Centre.

The Loring Development Authority works to attract business, housing and jobs to Loring’s 3,800 acres. Occupants have included Brunswick-based Green 4 Maine and, most recently, the Taste of Maine Potato Chip Co. The two aviation companies, whose names the authority is not yet releasing, would boost the authority’s plan to bring more aerospace jobs onto the former base. They would also ensure a future for its airport infrastructure, including its famed arch hangar.

“Due to the added attention that Operation Northern Phoenix has brought to Loring, there are two national aerospace companies that are looking at Loring as a potential home for their operations,” LDA President and CEO Jonathan Judkins said. “One of them would use the arch hangar, and the other would use the former tactical alert hangar.”

Northern Phoenix is a collaboration of the U.S. Air Force and New Hampshire Air National Guard, Judkins said. This year, multiple C-130 aircraft used the runways for test runs in a program that will grow over the next four years to include Black Hawk helicopters and possibly B-52s.

Next year’s training is slated in June. The events will see the addition of a mobile tower and lighting system to the runway that will remain at Loring, he said. When the five years is up, the Air Force will decide whether to continue training on-site.

Besides the return of a military mission, the training acquainted many more people with Loring, Judkins said. As a result, the commerce center has drawn interest from both public and private entities, which could bring good news on the job-creation front.

“For Loring, the most important thing about this is the jobs they will bring. That’s the LDA’s primary goal, creating jobs in Aroostook,” he said.

In the last couple of years, the authority has announced plans for a quantum research facility and a $4 billion sustainable aviation fuel production plant. Combined, they are projected to add more than 2,000 construction jobs and nearly 700 production jobs.

If the two aerospace companies decide to move in, it’s unclear how many jobs they would bring, but reuse of the base’s existing infrastructure also means that taxpayer assets will be preserved, rather than left to deteriorate, Judkins said.

Built in the late 1940s, the historic arch hangar is one of only two of its kind, according to Maine author Arend Thibodeau. The double-cantilever structure was designed to house the B-36 Peacemaker.

The Loring Air Museum and the LDA last year were at odds over the hangar’s future. The museum wanted it preserved as a historical artifact, while developers said it should be used for aerospace development.

While some have said the hangar is crumbling, Judkins said it is in reasonable shape. It has a new heating system and working electricity. Renovations would be mainly cosmetic, such as cleaning, painting, repairing doors and refinishing the roof.

The concrete roof has an insulation layer topped off with a membrane, he said. The membrane is peeling and there is a hole in the insulation, but the concrete is intact. The LDA plans to adhere a waterproof resin to the concrete and insulate inside the building.

Little used since the base closed in 1994, Loring’s airport has seen a flurry of activity in recent months.

Last fall, the Federal Aviation Administration reclassified Loring as a public airport. The Department of Defense also granted the LDA a $1 million Defense Community Infrastructure Program grant. The authority will use $750,000 of that to create an airport master plan, Judkins said. The remainder will pay for an electrical assessment and planning for grid stability in case of a catastrophic event.

The authority is also pursuing acceptance into the Federal Aviation Administration’s National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems, he said. That would make Loring part of the Military Airport Program, which could bring funds to improve other infrastructure and add additional aircraft hangars.

Judkins maintained that Loring’s greatest value has always been in its layout — the miles of paved, business-ready runway and ground.

“You can build any business you want on that runway,” he said. “You’re only limited by what you can imagine.”",https://thecounty.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ArchHangar-072024-pjb-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-07-24 11:56:55.485986

The document explains how Syzygy’s NovaSAF™ platform provides a scalable, policy-compatible, and economically feasible solution to help decarbonize the aviation sector, according to the press release.

Trevor Best, Syzygy Plasmonics’ CEO, emphasized that NovaSAF™ is more than just a product—it acts as a catalyst for policy advancement. He noted that the white paper demonstrates how technological innovation can assist regulators and industry players in achieving climate targets while also opening up new economic prospects.

With global regulators stepping up efforts to cut aviation emissions, the demand for SAF is projected to surpass 200 million metric tons per year by 2050. Yet, current production falls short by over 120 million metric tons. NovaSAF™ aims to close this gap by transforming biogenic methane and carbon dioxide into ASTM-certified SAF through the use of light-driven catalysts and renewable electricity. This process lowers equipment expenses, utilizes abundant feedstocks, and yields strong financial returns. In many cases, it competes favorably with the cost of HEFA and, under certain conditions, can even match Jet-A fuel prices.

Importantly, NovaSAF™ complies with both SAF and eSAF (electrofuels) standards under the EU’s RED III directive and the UK’s Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO). A single NovaSAF facility produces fuel that qualifies under two separate categories: a portion as an Advanced Biofuel and the remainder as a Renewable Fuel of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO). This dual certification grants access to premium SAF markets and helps ensure the financial sustainability of investments.

The white paper also highlights Syzygy’s Rigel reactor technology, which runs on renewable electricity and avoids fossil fuel combustion. This technology, combined with the established Fischer-Tropsch process, converts biogas into a liquid that can then be hydrotreated into SAF. Syzygy’s innovation lies in integrating these technologies into a modular system that supports distributed, site-specific production.

The paper features Syzygy’s inaugural commercial project, NovaSAF 1, based in Uruguay. This plant will convert manure from 14,000 cows into 400,000 gallons (1,100 tons) of SAF annually, powered by a national grid that is more than 90% renewable. The project serves as a proof of concept for the platform’s scalability and its potential to reduce methane and aviation emissions simultaneously.

Syzygy’s approach centers on expanding SAF production through replicable projects and technology licensing, aiming to fulfill the increasing demand for low-carbon aviation fuels over the next quarter-century.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-7.png,N,,2025-07-24 14:56:30.489392

The agreement includes more than $550 billion in new investment by Japan into core American industries. The agreement also includes Japan purchasing $8 billion in U.S. goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol and sustainable aviation fuel. Japan will also immediately increase imports of U.S. rice by 75%, with a major expansion of import quotas.

“We just completed a massive trade deal with Japan,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Japan will open its country to trade on items like cars, trucks, rice, and other agricultural products.” The president also said Japan will invest $550 billion in the U.S. “at my discretion.” He added that the U.S. would receive 90 percent of any profits, although he didn’t provide further details. The White House later on Wednesday released a fact sheet outlining some of the details: https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-secures-unprecedented-u-s-japan-strategic-trade-and-investment-agreement/

Many agriculture groups in the U.S. have started to share their reaction to the news of a trade deal with Japan. “We appreciate the work that the administration has dedicated to brokering a deal with Japan, worth $2.7 billion, and we welcome today’s announcement,” says National Corn Growers Association President Kenneth Hartman Jr. “Japan is the second largest market for U.S. corn exports, and we support any effort to expand the purchase of corn and corn products, like ethanol. U.S. corn growers produce an abundant crop year in and year out, and NCGA has long advocated for increased access to foreign markets, which will support American farmers and rural economies.”

In a statement, U.S. Grains Council President and CEO Ryan LeGrand said “The U.S. Grains Council applauds the Trump Administration on this agreement with our second largest trading partner – Japan. In the 2023-24 marketing year, Japan was the second largest importer of U.S. corn; the third largest importer of U.S. sorghum; the fourth largest importer of U.S. barley; and the 9th largest importer of U.S. distillers dried grains with solubles, totaling 14 million metric tons in corn-equivalent exports or $5.95 billion. This deal is an embodiment of our countries’ longstanding partnership and includes ethanol and SAF that fits into Japan’s policies of increasing the use of renewable fuels, that include U.S. ethanol. The Council looks forward to nurturing the important trade relationship for many more years to come.”

U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) President and CEO Dan Halstrom issued the following statement as well saying that “USMEF greatly appreciates the Trump administration’s agreement with Japan, reassuring and expanding opportunities in the #2 export destination for U.S. beef and pork. In President Trump’s first term, the critical U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement was reached, returning U.S. red meat to a level playing field in Japan and restoring its position as an extremely reliable market. According to the information released by the White House, the new agreement focuses on reinforcing the long-term economic partnership between the U.S. and Japan, which for decades has delivered tremendous benefits for the U.S. livestock and meat industries and for Japanese consumers, importers and customers. USMEF looks forward to continued growth and mutual benefits, and we thank the team at USTR and the Trump administration for another agreement reached in the critical Asia Pacific region.”

Growth Energy, the nation’s largest biofuel trade association, applauded the White House and President Trump as well following the announcement of this week’s trade deals with not only Japan, but also with Indonesia, that would open new markets for American biofuels and other agricultural co-products. The trade deal with Indonesia is expected to eliminate up to 99 percent of the tariff barriers on U.S. goods – including the 30 percent tariff currently imposed on U.S. ethanol exports. As part of the deal with Japan, the White House secured a commitment to purchase $8 billion in U.S. agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, ethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.

“Ethanol exports set a record in 2024, and President Trump’s latest deals will help to ensure that American farmers and biofuel producers continue to benefit from new and growing markets in Asia,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “We commend President Trump for following through on his commitment to unleash American energy dominance and tear down unfair barriers to exports from rural America.

In each case, it found that lobbyists representing fossil fuel actors that stood to lose billions from progressive climate regulations were able to influence the Conservative government’s policy without scrutiny.

While InfluenceMap’s report looks at policies relating to the UK’s net-zero ambitions, its findings on the way the UK’s lax laws allow lobbying to be conducted in secret can be applied across sectors. The think tank is calling for reforms to address this and close the “major transparency gap”.

The secrecy around lobbying, which has been at the heart of many government scandals in recent years, is a major driver of the disillusionment in British politics.

Three-quarters of the public believe the government is “rigged to serve the rich and influential”, according to polling conducted by More in Common and University College London’s Policy Lab last year.

InfluenceMap’s findings illustrate “how inadequate and opaque lobbying rules undermine effective policymaking”, said Alastair McCapra, the CEO of the UK lobbying industry body.

He added:

“Business engagement should help to build sounder policy with better outcomes for the public, but unaccountable lobbying breeds public mistrust. This important report removes the guesswork needed to piece together what kind of lobbying is taking place.”

Weak lobbying laws

openDemocracy has previously reported extensively on the ways that the UK’s weak lobbying laws allow corporate influence to secretly shape policy.

Our investigations have now been backed up by InfluenceMap, which has found a huge gap exists between the lobbying that takes place and that which is disclosed. This means the British public often has no way of knowing who is swaying policy.

Comparing transparency rules in the UK, the European Parliament, the US, Canada and France, InfluenceMap found that the UK has by far the worst system.

Of the five, only the UK exempts lobbyists who work in-house for a company, rather than for an agency or consultancy, from registering with a statutory lobbying watchdog. Less than 15% of lobbyists working in the UK need to register because of this rule.

The firms on the register must publish a list of clients on whose behalf they have lobbied each quarter. But they do not have to publish any details about the lobbying, including whether it involved written correspondence or a meeting and what legislation or policy was discussed.

Registered lobbyists also only need to declare clients for whom they lobbied government ministers and senior officials. There is no requirement to name clients when they approached other MPs and peers, including those on select committees, or influential government advisers.

The Committee for Standards in Public Life, an independent public body that advises the prime minister on lobbying and other aspects of public office, has consistently recommended the government publish a single, searchable database of all meetings with lobbyists.

Its recommendations would expand the scope of the current register considerably, requiring lobbyists to disclose the specific policies or legislation they discussed at meetings with government ministers and special advisers.

InfluenceMap has also called on the government to take up this recommendation and address the fundamental flaws in the lobbying act by including in-house lobbyists and publishing all responses to government policy consultants as standard.

Susan Hawley, executive director of Spotlight on Corruption, said the report “starkly demonstrates how major transparency gaps in the UK’s lobbying regime are undermining the development of good climate policy.”

“We fully support their recommendations to make lobbying much more transparent and bring the UK in line with international best practice. These reforms would support more participatory and open decision-making to help rebuild public trust and ensure better decision-making, widening the evidence base for policy making and reducing risks of policy capture by vested interests,” she said.

Oil and gas licensing

In 2022, the UK government quietly dropped two criteria from its ‘Climate Compatibility Checkpoint’ after lobbying from the fossil fuel industry. The checkpoint is used to assess whether proposed oil and gas licenses align with the UK’s climate change goals.

Oil giants BP and Shell and their industry association, Offshore Energies UK (OEUK), responded to a consultation on the checkpoint by objecting to the inclusion of two key metrics for measuring the impact of fossil fuels, according to InfluenceMap’s analysis of consultation responses obtained via Freedom of Information requests.

The measures they opposed would have required the government to consider ‘Scope 3 emissions’ and the ‘global production gap’ when issuing new oil and gas licences.

Scope 3 emissions are produced during end-use and contribute the largest share of all emissions from oil and gas production, while the production gap tracks the discrepancy between planned fossil fuel production and what’s needed to limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C.

The government dropped both criteria from the final checkpoint, which instead focuses solely on operational emissions, which represent only a fraction of total emissions from oil and gas projects.

This outcome, InfluenceMap’s report notes, strongly aligns with the positions advocated for by BP, Shell, and OEUK, suggesting their lobbying efforts were successful.

The following year, the government approved 100 new North Sea oil and gas licences, which had a potential emissions footprint equivalent to Denmark’s annual output.

InfluenceMap’s report also highlights the issues around government consultations on proposed policies, pointing out that, as in this case, lobbyists typically use these to suggest amendments in favour of their clients, but their responses are not published as standard.

Similarly, unlike in the other four Parliaments InfluenceMap looked at, corporations in the UK are not required to declare their engagement on policies, how much they spend on lobbying, or which legislation or decisions they are targeting.

It highlights that this can lead to a situation in which companies make voluntary corporate disclosures that fail to capture the true extent of this advocacy. In this case, InfluenceMap found BP published a summary of its response to the checkpoint that omitted key lines of its opposition, which were only revealed later through Freedom of Information requests.

Rachel Davies, advocacy director at Transparency International UK, said:

“This report highlights, yet again, the glaring gaps in our lobbying transparency regime and the potential risks of favouring a small group of vested interests at the public’s expense.

“The UK needs to catch up to other comparable democracies and act swiftly to introduce a comprehensive lobbying register with meaningful disclosures.”

Domestic hydrogen

It is broadly agreed that, in the UK, hydrogen is not a viable solution for decarbonising domestic heating and is an especially bad alternative to heat pumps. Much of our hydrogen comes from burning gas or coal and it cannot be transported through our existing pipelines without massive and costly infrastructure changes.

This reality has been set out by different independent bodies advising the UK government.

In 2021, the Climate Change Committee warned that hydrogen had “not yet been proven at scale and should not be a cause to delay other options” such as the roll-out of heat pumps or low-carbon heat networks. Two years later, the National Infrastructure Commission said the government “should not support the roll-out of hydrogen heating” because there is “no public policy case” for its use.

As InfluenceMap’s report notes, this has not prevented the gas industry from waging a successful lobbying campaign in a bid to shore up its market position – with a clear impact on government policy.

The think tank found the industry pursued its cause in a number of ways, including setting up Hello Hydrogen, a campaign fronted by TV star Rachel Riley, to make the case for using hydrogen in homes to the public in 2022. While the campaign did not declare its funders, its director was also a director of Cadent Gas, the UK’s largest gas distribution network.

Cadent is one of the funders of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Hydrogen, which has publicly called for hydrogen to play a part in domestic heating. The APPG’s other funders include Equinor, Shell and the Energy and Utilities Alliance, a lobbying body run by Mike Foster, the former Labour MP for Worcester (home to Worcester Bosch, a major manufacturer of gas boilers).

Other fossil fuel firms and industry lobbying bodies have also consistently pushed for the use of hydrogen in domestic heating in letters to parliamentary select committees and responses to government consultations.

Ahead of last year’s general election, Centrica (formerly British Gas) wrote to the Public Accounts Committee, which examines the value for money of government projects, to call for further public investment in hydrogen for home heating. The firm had written to the Energy Security and Net Zero Committee in support of the technology less than 12 months earlier.

This industry lobbying has led to indecision and disruption on government plans. A February 2023 report by the House of Lords Committee blamed mixed messages on the effectiveness of hydrogen from the government and industry for the poor uptake of a publicly subsidised scheme for heat pumps, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create many jobs.

The lords’ report concluded:

“Hydrogen is not a serious option for home heating for the short to medium-term and misleading messages, including from the government, are negatively affecting take-up of established low-carbon home heating technologies like heat pumps.”

The UK’s heat pump roll-outs have lagged behind those of its neighbours. Just 55,000 heat pumps were installed in the UK in 2019, compared to 600,000 in France, according to a study cited in the InfluenceMap report.

In the UK, this reportedly created around 2,000 jobs and reduced emissions of CO₂ by 0.08 million tonnes (MT); in France 30,000 jobs were created and 0.84 MT of CO₂ emissions avoided.

‘Sustainable’ aviation fuel

InfluenceMap also uncovered how industry significantly influenced the government’s so-called ‘Jet Zero’ strategy for cutting emissions in the UK’s aviation industry, which is heavily reliant on fossil fuels.

Biofuels, largely made up of used cooking oils, are often suggested as an option for producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), although they are generally accepted to be worse in terms of scalability than other, more advanced fuels, and much worse than just reducing the number of flights.

The government initially proposed limiting the use of used cooking oil for SAF to alleviate competition on the resource – which is increasingly in demand for other uses, such as producing biodiesel for cars – and to encourage investment in new technologies for the aviation industry.

The proposals included two options; either banning the use of used cooking oil for SAF altogether, or rapidly phasing down its use so that it would make up just 8.5% of total sustainable aviation fuel by 2040.

But the government’s final SAF policy was more closely aligned with industry preferences than scientific warnings, InfluenceMap found. It allows used cooking oil to make up 100% of SAF uptake in 2025 and 2026, 71% in 2030, and 35% in 2040.

InfluenceMap’s analysis reveals the weakened SAF mandate came after pressure from Shell, BP, the International Airlines Group (which owns several airlines), Airlines UK (the trade body for UK-registered airlines) and Virgin Atlantic airline.

It also found that business interests were overrepresented in parliamentary meetings on SAF while the policy was being shaped.

This can be seen in the make-up of Parliament’s Jet Zero Council, “a partnership between industry academia and government”, which was run by Heathrow’s chief operating officer, while the International Airlines Group chaired the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Delivery Group.

The council comprised 24 members from industry, three from academia and one from civil society. Ministers were also directly involved with the council, with then-prime minister Boris Johnson attending the group’s first meeting along with four ministers.

Transparency failures again played a key role. Not a single ministerial meeting on SAF referenced the weakening of the cooking oil cap in official records, and industry responses to consultations were only obtained through Freedom of Information.

The action marks a milestone for both partners on the journey to more sustainable aviation. Alternative fuels such as Synhelion’s solar fuel are crucial to the industry’s endeavors to achieve its ambitious carbon reduction objectives.

Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) has become the first airline in the world to integrate the solar fuel manufactured by the Swiss-based Synhelion clean-tech company into its regular flight operations. Synhelion delivered a first 190-liter barrel of synthetic crude oil from its DAWN production facility to a refinery in Northern Germany, where the oil, which had been manufactured using solar energy, was processed into certified Jet-A-1 aviation fuel. The fuel was then fed into SWISS’s flight operations infrastructure via the fuel supply system at Hamburg Airport.

The fuel supplied are some seven percent of the fuel required for a Hamburg-Zurich flight – a symbolic start, but a hugely significant one. It may sound little, but it’s a landmark for the aviation sector, confirming that Synhelion’s technology works and is ready for the next steps ahead. Its seamless integration into existing refinery processes is crucial to securing the swift global scalability of Synhelion’s technology.

“This first delivery of Synhelion’s solar fuel marks a genuine milestone in our long-standing partnership,” confirms SWISS CEO Jens Fehlinger. “We have intentionally invested in a Swiss start-up; and we are delighted to celebrate this landmark achievement together. This is the first time that solar fuel has been used in civil aviation. And we are truly proud to be playing such a pioneering role, in partnership with Synhelion, in driving and developing this vital new technology for a more sustainable aviation sector.”

“Sustainable fuels are a key lever in reducing air transport’s reliance on fossil fuels,” adds Synhelion co-founder and co-CEO Philipp Furler. “Our delivery of this first barrel to SWISS may be a symbolic action. But it’s a concrete one, too, towards a more sustainable aviation sector. This milestone brings us one step closer to globally scaling up our solar fuel technology. And we’re very grateful to have such invaluable support from our partners at SWISS and the Lufthansa Group as we continue on this journey.”

Next steps: certification and scale-up. Sustainable fuels such as Synhelion’s solar fuel are key if the aviation sector is to achieve its ambitious carbon reduction objectives. This is why it is so vital that all the parties involved play their full part and join other airlines, business and industry, the political world, the research field and consumers in driving and promoting the adoption of such fuels with all possible speed. SWISS has been serving as a strategic partner to Synhelion since 2020 to support the commercialization of the company’s pioneering technologies. SWISS has also been an investor in Synhelion since 2022.

Further steps remain before solar fuel can be more extensively used in the aviation sector. The facilities required to ensure continuous production of the fuel and adequate production capacities are now being developed to permit a commercial market entry from 2027. The EU Renewable Energy Directive stipulates that sustainable synthetic fuels must achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 70 percent compared to fossil kerosene. The life cycle assessment carried out by an independent institution confirms that the fuels from the DAWN production facility can significantly exceed this target. As a next step, Synhelion and SWISS are now jointly driving forward the sustainability certification of the production process and the fuel in accordance with the requirements of the EU directive.

Lufthansa Group: a long-standing commitment to sustainable fuels. As part of the Lufthansa Group, SWISS can both draw and build on decades of experience in the sustainable aviation fuel field. The Lufthansa Group is involved in research and pilot projects, is an active member of various industrywide alliances and offers numerous innovative sustainable aviation fuel products and incentives for both corporate and private customers. It has also concluded a number of long-term fuel procurement agreements which send a strong signal to the global fuel markets and help further drive and shape the industry’s transformation.

Neste’s comparable quarterly earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose 42% from a year earlier to 341 million euros ($401 million).

Analysts in a company-provided consensus had expected 302.5 million euros on average.

“Our sustainable aviation fuel sales increased close to 80% quarter on quarter, benefiting from additional SAF production capacity at our renewables refinery in Rotterdam,” CEO Heikki Malinen said in a statement.

The rise in SAF sales drove the sales volume in Neste’s renewable products unit to a new quarterly record of 1,096 thousand tonnes. The unit’s sales volume margin fell 5% to $361 per tonne, but exceeded analysts’ forecast of $329 per tonne.

“We saw positive developments in the biofuel regulation both in the US and EU, largely supporting long-term renewables demand,” Malinen, who joined the company last year, said.

RBC analysts said in a research note that the second quarter was a “key litmus test” for Neste’s new management, adding the results boded well for the investor sentiment.

However, Malinen warned that the market environment was volatile and headwinds from global trade tensions were expected to continue.

Neste has been battling an excess supply in the renewable fuels market, pressuring its sales volumes and leading to a reduction of around 510 jobs globally earlier in 2025.

Alhough the group said it still expected its annual sales volumes to improve from 2024, it also forecast persisting oversupply in the renewable fuels market for the year.

The industry says that achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 depends on expanding SAF availability and affordability — and fast.

Backed by the European Green Deal and the Paris Agreement, the sector reiterates its full commitment to decarbonising air travel.

“SAF is no longer a distant solution, it is a reality that must scale now,” the statement said. “It presents the opportunity to improve the EU’s energy security, strengthen its economic prosperity and bolster climate innovation.”

The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation has already played a key role, prompting SAF production to grow from almost zero to 1.2 million tonnes by 2024.

But with €61 billion needed annually to decarbonise aviation, the industry warns that high costs, regulatory complexity, and a lack of investment instruments are holding back progress.

The 10-point action plan for 2025–2026 calls for extended SAF allowances under the EU Emissions Trading System, targeted funding for e-SAF and bio-SAF projects and risk-reducing financial products from the European Investment Bank.

It also urges a revenue certainty mechanism — such as contracts for difference — to de-risk production investment and create a thriving SAF market.

Additional actions include simplifying regulation, increasing access to renewable electricity and eligible biomass, and supporting the testing and certification of new e-SAF technologies.

The aviation ecosystem emphasises the need for collaboration across Member States, EU bodies and private investors to meet 2030 targets.

“ReFuelEU Aviation is the backbone of Europe’s SAF strategy but its success relies on swift, coordinated action to resolve the remaining investment and implementation barriers,” the group concluded.

SWISS has become the first airline in the world to integrate the solar fuel manufactured by Swiss-based clean-tech pioneer Synhelion into its flight operations. The action marks a milestone for both partners on the journey to more sustainable aviation. Alternative fuels such as Synhelion’s solar fuel are crucial to the industry’s endeavors to achieve its ambitious carbon reduction objectives.

Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) has become the first airline in the world to integrate the solar fuel manufactured by the Swiss-based Synhelion clean-tech company into its regular flight operations. Synhelion delivered a first 190-liter barrel of synthetic crude oil from its DAWN production facility to a refinery in Northern Germany, where the oil, which had been manufactured using solar energy, was processed into certified Jet-A-1 aviation fuel. The fuel was then fed into SWISS’s flight operations infrastructure via the fuel supply system at Hamburg Airport.

The fuel supplied are some seven percent of the fuel required for a Hamburg-Zurich flight – a symbolic start, but a hugely significant one. It may sound little, but it’s a landmark for the aviation sector, confirming that Synhelion’s technology works and is ready for the next steps ahead. Its seamless integration into existing refinery processes is crucial to securing the swift global scalability of Synhelion’s technology.

“This first delivery of Synhelion’s solar fuel marks a genuine milestone in our long-standing partnership,” confirms SWISS CEO Jens Fehlinger. “We have intentionally invested in a Swiss start-up; and we are delighted to celebrate this landmark achievement together. This is the first time that solar fuel has been used in civil aviation. And we are truly proud to be playing such a pioneering role, in partnership with Synhelion, in driving and developing this vital new technology for a more sustainable aviation sector.”

“Sustainable fuels are a key lever in reducing air transport’s reliance on fossil fuels,” adds Synhelion co-founder and co-CEO Philipp Furler. “Our delivery of this first barrel to SWISS may be a symbolic action. But it’s a concrete one, too, towards a more sustainable aviation sector. This milestone brings us one step closer to globally scaling up our solar fuel technology. And we’re very grateful to have such invaluable support from our partners at SWISS and the Lufthansa Group as we continue on this journey.”

Next steps: certification and scale-up

Sustainable fuels such as Synhelion’s solar fuel are key if the aviation sector is to achieve its ambitious carbon reduction objectives. This is why it is so vital that all the parties involved play their full part and join other airlines, business and industry, the political world, the research field and consumers in driving and promoting the adoption of such fuels with all possible speed. SWISS has been serving as a strategic partner to Synhelion since 2020 to support the commercialization of the company’s pioneering technologies. SWISS has also been an investor in Synhelion since 2022.

Further steps remain before solar fuel can be more extensively used in the aviation sector. The facilities required to ensure continuous production of the fuel and adequate production capacities are now being developed to permit a commercial market entry from 2027. The EU Renewable Energy Directive stipulates that sustainable synthetic fuels must achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 70 percent compared to fossil kerosene. The life cycle assessment carried out by an independent institution confirms that the fuels from the DAWN production facility can significantly exceed this target. As a next step, Synhelion and SWISS are now jointly driving forward the sustainability certification of the production process and the fuel in accordance with the requirements of the EU directive.

Lufthansa Group: a long-standing commitment to sustainable fuels

As part of the Lufthansa Group, SWISS can both draw and build on decades of experience in the sustainable aviation fuel field. The Lufthansa Group is involved in research and pilot projects, is an active member of various industrywide alliances and offers numerous innovative sustainable aviation fuel products and incentives for both corporate and private customers. It has also concluded a number of long-term fuel procurement agreements which send a strong signal to the global fuel markets and help further drive and shape the industry’s transformation.

Conclusion Neste's pivot to SAF is more than a strategic repositioning—it's a masterclass in leveraging industry challenges to build long-term resilience.","In the rapidly evolving renewable fuels landscape, Neste has emerged as a trailblazer, transforming margin pressures into a formidable competitive advantage through its aggressive expansion in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) sector. As the global aviation industry grapples with decarbonization mandates and investor demands for greener operations, Neste's strategic pivot to SAF is not just a response to market forces—it's a calculated move to dominate a sector poised for exponential growth.

A Production Powerhouse in the Making

Neste's recent upgrades to its Rotterdam refinery have positioned it as a global leader in SAF production. By 2025, the company has already increased its SAF capacity to 1.5 million tons per annum, with the Rotterdam facility alone set to produce 500,000 tons annually. When fully operational by 2027, this site will become the world's largest production hub for SAF and renewable diesel, giving Neste unmatched scalability to meet surging demand.

This expansion is not merely about scale. Neste's ability to flexibly shift production between road and aviation fuels allows it to capitalize on market volatility. For instance, in Q2 2025, SAF sales surged by 80% compared to the previous quarter, underscoring the effectiveness of this strategy. By aligning production with demand fluctuations, Neste mitigates margin pressures that plague competitors with fixed-output models.

Strategic Partnerships and Regulatory Alignment

Neste's dominance in SAF is further solidified by its partnerships with industry giants. A landmark 2025 deal with Amazon Air to supply 7,500 metric tons of neat SAF for cargo operations at two U.S. airports exemplifies this. The logistics are equally innovative: SAF is delivered via existing pipelines in California and trucked using renewable diesel-powered vehicles, minimizing carbon footprints while optimizing costs.

These partnerships are not isolated successes. Neste has secured contracts with FedEx and other major airlines, aligning itself with the sector's urgent need to meet net-zero targets. Regulatory tailwinds are equally strong. The company's proactive alignment with the EU's ReFuelEU Aviation initiative and RED III mandates ensures it remains ahead of compliance curves, a critical factor in markets where policy uncertainty often stifles growth.

Operational Efficiency as a Differentiator

Neste's cost management strategies are equally impressive. By sourcing feedstocks like used cooking oil and animal fat waste—materials that are both abundant and low-cost—the company reduces raw material expenses. Third-party audits ensure these materials meet sustainability standards, a non-negotiable requirement for SAF certifications.

The supply chain innovation is another standout. For example, the use of Diesel Direct for truck deliveries to Ontario International Airport not only streamlines operations but also leverages Neste's renewable diesel to cut emissions. This closed-loop system—where SAF distribution further reduces carbon footprints—creates a unique value proposition for customers and investors alike.

Investment Implications

For investors, Neste's SAF strategy represents a rare confluence of market leadership, regulatory alignment, and operational agility. The company's ability to convert margin pressures into competitive advantages is evident in its 80% Q2 sales growth and its position as the world's largest SAF producer. With the Rotterdam expansion nearing completion and RED III implementation on the horizon, Neste is poised to capture a significant share of a market projected to grow by over 30% annually through 2030.

However, risks remain. Feedstock supply chain disruptions and the high capital intensity of SAF production could test Neste's margins. Yet, the company's diversified sourcing strategy and partnerships with logistics providers like Diesel Direct provide a buffer.

Conclusion

Neste's pivot to SAF is more than a strategic repositioning—it's a masterclass in leveraging industry challenges to build long-term resilience. By combining cutting-edge production capabilities, regulatory foresight, and operational efficiency, the company is not just surviving in a margin-pressed market; it's thriving. For investors seeking exposure to the decarbonization megatrend, Neste offers a compelling case: a leader in a high-growth sector with the infrastructure, partnerships, and innovation to outpace competitors.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-24 06:59:11.050035

The UNSW team have developed a carbon dioxide electrolyser system using low-cost transition metal and carbon catalysts, which can be integrated with the established Fischer-Trophsch (FT) process to produce sustainable aviation fuel.

FT is a chemical reaction that converts a mix of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H) (syngas) into liquid hydrocarbons, and takes place at moderate temperatures and pressures.

To achieve further breakthroughs a $1.2 million through the Trailblazer for Recycling and Clean Energy (TRaCE) Australian Department of Education fund will aid moving the technology from technology readiness level (TRL) 4 (proof-of-concept in the lab) to TRL 6 (validated prototype in a relevant environment.

UNSW School of Mineral and Energy Resources Engineering Scientia Fellow and Lead Chief Investigator Dr Rahman Daiyan said the goal is to revolutionise how clean fuels for aviation are produced.

“The aim is to use renewable energy to transform carbon dioxide (CO₂) into usable fuels without requiring costly infrastructure changes,” Daiyan said.

“This technology could be the key to decarbonising aviation, one of the world’s most challenging sectors.”

A spin-off company, called Gurung Fuel, will be funded and led by the research team’s industry partners, Sydney-headquartered energy solutions engineering company Tjindu Power, and Chinese clean tech developer Chuangqi Times (Qingdao) Technology Company.

Chuangqi Times (Qingdao) Adjunt Professor Yun said the partnership is a major step towards scaling the cutting-edge electrolyser technology.

Formula 1 is trying to change that.

Often referred to as “the pinnacle of motorsport,” the racecar organization, which hosts an annual championship featuring the best drivers in the world, has seen its carbon emissions drop 26% since 2018. At the end of the 2024 season, the sport’s carbon footprint fell to 168,720 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent from 228,793.

F1 said in a statement on Wednesday that it’s halfway toward achieving its minimum 50% reduction target, as set out in its “net zero by 2030” commitment.

“It’s a key milestone and the culmination of a lot of work,” said Ellen Jones, head of environmental, social and governance at F1, in an interview. “We’ve changed the way we operate, changed the way we work” with the racing teams and promoters, as well Formula 1’s management and regulator, she said.

A major factor in the reductions has been a years-long shift to renewable energy, Jones said. Investment in sustainable aviation fuel for travel and freight use, and other alternative energy sources, including solar and biofuels, contributed to the decline. Next year, F1 has set a target for the cars to have new hybrid engines and be powered entirely by advanced sustainable fuel.

“We’re not only changing what we’re doing materially, we’re also changing the technologies,” Jones said.

The sport has achieved carbon reductions across the four major categories that it tracks: factories and facilities, down 59% since 2018; logistics, down 9%; event operations, down 12% on a per-race basis; and travel, down 25%.

An increase in using remote operations and changes to the race schedule also have resulted in lower greenhouse gas emissions. Having remote broadcast operations has allowed about 140 personnel to avoid having to travel to the race location each weekend. And changing the date of the Japanese Grand Prix to align with other races last year in the Asia-Pacific region also contributed to lower emissions. In 2026, the date of the Monaco Grand Prix will be moved to align with other European events and eliminate an additional transatlantic crossing.

F1 said its climate commitment is “set in accordance with the science” from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and aligns with the panel's definition of net zero emissions. The racing series’ goal is to reduce absolute emissions by a minimum of 50% from a 2018 baseline, which was calculated using guidance set by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.

F1 has faced criticism from activists who say the sport is harmful to the environment. In 2022, demonstrators with Just Stop Oil sat on the track during the 2022 British Grand Prix, disrupting the race. The construction of Madrid's Grand Prix street circuit also has prompted backlash.

Both agreements are expected to benefit the U.S. agriculture industry, including farmers and ethanol producers.

The trade deal with Indonesia includes provisions eliminating tariff barriers, on a preferential basis, on over 99% of U.S. products exported to Indonesia across all sectors, including for all agricultural products, health products, seafood, information and communications technology, automotive products, and chemicals.

The Japanese trade deal includes a provision specifically targeting ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). According to the White House, Japan will purchase $8 billion in U.S. goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol, and SAF.

The Renewable Fuels Association has spoken out in support of both trade agreements. “We’re grateful to President Trump and his team for ensuring U.S. agriculture and renewable fuels are prominently included in these framework agreements,” said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the RFA. “These deals will ultimately help open important Asian markets and allow greater access for American farm products, renewable fuels, and co-products like distillers grains. This administration clearly understands the leading role American farmers and renewable fuel producers can play when it comes to feeding and fueling the world, and we salute President Trump’s efforts to secure fair and reciprocal agreements around the globe. Breaking down barriers to fair trade strengthens our rural economy and the United States as a whole.”

Growth Energy applauded the agreements. “Ethanol exports set a record in 2024, and President Trump’s latest deals will help to ensure that American farmers and biofuel producers continue to benefit from new and growing markets in Asia,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “We commend President Trump for following through on his commitment to unleash American energy dominance and tear down unfair barriers to exports from rural America. We also thank the teams at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the U.S. Department of Agriculture for their tireless work to deliver these trade deals and removing trade barriers for U.S. ethanol.”

The U.S. Grains Council is also commending the agreements. “The U.S. Grains Council commends the Trump Administration on its historic trade deal with Indonesia, that will enhance trade for both countries and places a zero tariff on the products the Council represents,” said Ryan LeGrand, president and CEO of the USGC. “In the 2023-24 marketing year, Indonesia was the fourth largest importer for U.S. distillers dried grains with solubles at 1,024,000 metric tons. That translates into a nearly $299 million market, and we hope the deal announced today will not only help see those numbers increase but open doors wider to the full range of products we have to offer.”

“The U.S. Grains Council applauds the Trump Administration on this agreement with our second largest trading partner – Japan,” LeGrand added. In the 2023-24 marketing year, Japan was the second largest importer of U.S. corn; the third largest importer of U.S. sorghum; the fourth largest importer of U.S. barley; and the 9th largest importer of U.S. distillers dried grains with solubles, totaling 14 million metric tons in corn-equivalent exports or $5.95 billion.

The final bill mirrors some last-minute changes the Senate made to the tax provisions in the sprawling budget bill—reviving long-expired biofuel subsidies in addition to expanding eligibility and extending expiration for another major biofuels tax credit.

The final bill extends the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit by two years and greatly expands its eligibility. 45Z, originally created by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), is designed to subsidize production of transportation fuels with low or no greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This credit came into effect at the beginning of 2025 and was intended to replace a suite of recently expired biofuel tax credits (Section 40, 40A, 40B, 6426, and 6427). 45Z was scheduled to expire in 2027 under the IRA but will now expire at the end of 2029 under OBBBA—two years shorter than the House-passed bill and the Senate Finance Committee draft, but still a two-year bonus for eligible producers.

The final OBBBA stayed the same course as previous House and Senate proposals and preserves a controversial carveout that eliminates penalties for converting forests or grasslands into farmland for biofuels production. This essentially weakens the definition of “clean” fuel and significantly broadens eligibility for the credit, effectively allowing first-generation, food-based biofuels like corn ethanol and soy biodiesel to qualify. Corn ethanol and soy-based biodiesel—already mandated under the Renewable Fuel Standard and subsidized since the Carter era—could once again dominate the biofuels subsidy stream.

OBBBA establishes parity between Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other transportation fuels under 45Z. SAF was previously eligible for a maximum credit of $1.75 per gallon (if prevailing wage and apprenticeship (PW&A) requirements are met), whereas other non-SAF fuels were only eligible for a maximum credit of $1.00 per gallon (if PW&A requirements are met). Under OBBBA, all fuels are eligible for the same $1.00 per gallon a maximum credit. Additionally, the bill eliminates potential double-dipping of 45Z and the SAF excise tax credit under Section 6426(k).

Mirroring the last-minute changes made by the Senate Budget Committee, the final bill also tacked on a provision that resurrects and increases the biodiesel tax credit (Section 40A), which had previously expired at the end of 2024, but only for small agri-biodiesel producers (Section 40A(b)(4)). The credit now runs from mid-2025 through the end of 2026. OBBBA doubles the credit amount from $0.10 per gallon to $0.20 per gallon for fuels sold after June 30, 2025. The small agri-biodiesel credit can now be transferred to an unrelated third party and be stacked on top of 45Z. In effect, some producers could double dip 40A and 45Z for the same gallon of fuel.

The final bill imposes new “foreign entity of concern” (FEOC) restrictions for the suite of tax credits that are not terminated, including 45Z. No specified foreign entities can claim 45Z after OBBBA’s enactment. No foreign-influenced entities (an FEOC category of lesser degree) can claim 45Z two years after the bill’s enactment.

UK names SAF and e-SAF projects to share £63mn funding

London, 22 July (Argus) — The UK government has named 17 sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and e-fuels projects to share £63mn ($85mn) grant funding in the third round of its advanced fuels fund (AFF). The projects range in size from trials to commercial scale, and propose to use technologies incuding alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) or synthesis of CO2 and renewable hydrogen to make e-SAF ( see table ). The UK gave the largest sum, £10mn, to US firm LanzaJet for its 80,000 t/yr SAF plant targeting 2028 start, which will exclusively supply to British Airways. London granted £8mn to Riyadh-headquartered Alfanar for its Lighthouse Green Fuels project that aims to make more than 125,000 t/yr of SAF. Alfanar won £11mn and £8.7mn in the first and second rounds, respectively. Its start date has slipped to 2029 and costs have risen to £2bn from £1.5bn, the firm said last month. Some projects could make SAF and e-SAF, such as Essar's project at Stanlow, which aims to use a combined 550,000 t/yr of e-methanol and biomethanol to make 200,000 t/yr of SAF products. It will use the funds for a pre-front-end engineering design (Feed) study and it plans a final investment decision in 2027, it said. Nine grant winners will make at least some proportion of e-SAF, either directly from hydrogen or by converting e-methanol. This route is sometimes called power-to-liquid in the UK. Of the e-SAF projects, the largest award went to UK start-up Carbon Neutral Fuels, which won £6mn for a project that aims to make 25,000 t/yr of e-SAF starting from 2031. The firm is starting Feed for the plant, it said. The UK has now granted nearly £200mn to projects through the AFF scheme, with the third round building on the £80mn first round and £53mn second round . The third-round grants can go towards engineering, procurement and construction, Feed studies, and pre-feed studies, but not to feasibility studies. The UK is separately developing a revenue certainty subsidy scheme for novel SAF and e-SAF production. At least one UK-focused SAF project could stall having missed out on funding. The Gramm Consortium is considering ""last-minute options"" to keep a proposed 250,000 t/yr SAF plant in the UK and may re-locate to the US, the project's lead Alexander Peschkoff said. With an increasing number of world governments setting SAF quotas, pressure is mounting to add more production pathways to avoid shortages. The UK and EU have gone furthest in this respect by adding separate e-SAF quotas to spur novel production routes. But there is much uncertainty about the best technologies to use. The UK is fast approaching the 2028 start for its e-SAF quota, while the EU's is due to start in 2030.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), particularly hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) derived from waste cooking oil (WCO), is the most viable pathway to realize the target of “Fly Net Zero” for the aviation industry. To develop reaction mechanisms of SAF suitable for combustor simulations, two different SAFs (named SAF1 and SAF2) synthesized from WCO and certificated by Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) were investigated. The detailed compositional analyses of these two SAFs were executed via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique, and the results were used to construct surrogate models. The pyrolysis and oxidation experiments were performed in a flow reactor at 1000 K and an atmospheric pressure to obtain the speciation data for the two SAFs. The Hybrid Chemistry (HyChem) approach was employed to develop reaction mechanisms of the two SAFs. A multi-objective genetic algorithm, NSGA-II, was utilized to determine the three Arrhenius coefficients of the seven lumped reactions. Both HyChem models were successfully validated by the experimental data. The speciation data and global combustion parameters were accurately predicted by HyChem models for these two SAFs. Finally, sensitivity analysis revealed the similar effects of the seven lumped reactions on ignition delay time (IDT) for the two SAFs. R2 (fuel + H), R4 (fuel + OH), and R5 (fuel + O2) play important roles in the system reactivity, while R6 (fuel + HO2) and R7 (fuel + O) have negligible influence on IDT predictions for all tested conditions.",https://cdn.ssrn.com/ssrn-global-header/11589acb53bc518aa22929bf19add113.svg,N,,2025-07-24 02:00:31.663306

As part of this initiative, Illinois engineers have been hard at work creating the critical nanocatalysts for converting biocrude oil from food waste such as salad dressing into sustainable aviation fuel.

A side of salad dressing, that is.

In 2020, the United States federal government committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. An important step toward carbon neutrality is embracing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), an alternative to conventional jet fuel that is made from renewable feedstocks. As part of this initiative, Illinois engineers have been hard at work creating the critical nanocatalysts for converting biocrude oil from food waste such as salad dressing into sustainable aviation fuel.

Hong Yang, a professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering in the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences, and Yuanhui Zhang, a professor of agricultural and biological engineering in the Grainger College of Engineering, joined forces to tackle this problem.

Their findings, published in Science Advances, present a low-cost, scalable, and reusable catalyst to produce an alternative to traditional jet fuel, demonstrating the first production of SAF from food waste-derived biocrude using non-noble metal carbide catalysts.

“There is already an industry effort for SAF production in North America, but primarily in competition with food supply such as soybean oil,” said Zhang. “Currently, the United States consumes about 40 million tons of jet fuel annually which only includes about 1% of SAF. We could increase that number to 10-20% from biowaste alone.”

Unlike traditional jet fuels derived from fossil crude oil, SAF is made from renewable resources such as biomass, energy crops, food waste, sewage sludge, and algal bloom. For nearly three decades, Zhang’s lab has been working to produce biocrude oil via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of organic waste streams. HTL mimics the natural process of fossil crude formation but accelerates the conversion timeline from millions of years to half an hour.

Yang and Zhang thought that by simultaneously addressing carbon emissions and food waste they could kill two birds with one stone.

After collecting food waste from the Kraft food plant in Champaign, Illinois, the researchers used HTL to convert the waste into a biocrude oil. This biocrude was upgraded using non-precious metal carbide catalysts developed by Yang’s lab.

“Molybdenum carbide is an attractive option for a catalyst that aids this process because its outer shell electrons interact with biocrude molecules to remove oxygen,” Yang said.

For their specific food waste of choice, the team quickly zeroed in on salad dressing because it is preprocessed, homogenous, and high in energy. Through a catalytic conversion process, scientists can remove unwanted oxygen in these biocrudes, turning them into hydrocarbon fuels.

“We also have to fine tune the catalysts by adding iron atoms and other species to produce fuel molecules with molecular weights that resemble the fuel composition” said Siying Yu, a chemical and biomolecular engineering graduate student and the first author of the paper.

Going forward, Zhang and Yang will continue collaborating with the goal of enhancing their catalyst design to better convert biocrude made from other biowaste to meet SAF criteria. Specifically, they’d like their catalyst to work for a variety of bio feedstocks such as algae and sewage. The metal carbide nanocatalysts they developed could also be appliable in studying SAF production from oleochemical-based fermentation products and crop-based feedstocks.

“There is no good substitute for aviation fuel for long-haul air transportation, so the research on SAF products is very much needed.” Yang said. “I’m optimistic because our students love this research topic. They want to work on something that will change the world.”

Nova Sustainable Fuels is hosting a community event this week to court community buy-in.","A proposed jet fuel megaproject on Nova Scotia's Eastern Shore is inching forward, with the proponents saying they plan to submit for environmental assessment before the fall.

The proposal is to produce sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, a lower-emission alternative to conventional jet fuel, and ship it by boat to distributors and airlines.

The project would include two components in Guysborough County — a joint wind and solar farm in St. Mary's and a plant in the community of Goldboro. The plant would use the wind and solar energy, as well as wood chips, to power hydrogen production. The hydrogen, in turn, would power the production of SAF.

Michael Galvin has been working on the idea for four years and said he's eager to make the project's first submission to the province. He expects the application for environmental assessment for the Goldboro plant will be made in early September.

""It's really significant and it's also really significant for our investors to see that we have reached this milestone,"" he said in an interview.

The project began with Irish firm Simply Blue Group, but changed hands this year. Galvin was chief operating officer at Simply Blue and moved, along with the project, to Octopus Energy Generation, which is now backing the project.

A local entity, Nova Sustainable Fuels, was created to manage the project.

Interest in sustainable aviation fuel has been growing in recent years, particularly in Europe where some governments have set mandates and created subsidies for its use. Galvin said that means the list of proposed SAF projects — and competitors — got very long. But he said that's begun to change.

""A lot of the hype has started to die down. And now you're seeing the really serious players and really serious investors have now stepped forward, and I think you're seeing the strongest projects and the most likely projects to run to completion.""

Galvin said completion for his project is still at least five years away, assuming it receives all the necessary approvals and raises enough capital. He wouldn't put an exact number on it, but said the cost will be in the billions of dollars.

""It's costing more than I wish it was going to cost. These are big numbers and big infrastructure projects,"" he said.

This is not the only major industrial project proposed for Guysborough County. Other companies are eyeing the remote eastern corner of mainland Nova Scotia for wind farms to power hydrogen production, a commercial spaceport and a gold mine.

Paul Long, warden of the District of the Municipality of Guysborough, said the local government is hungry for economic development.

""We're a small, small municipality — there's only 4,500 people or so in the municipality,"" Long said in an interview.

""So we can't rely just on the tax base, the residential tax base, to do the things we want to do and provide the services for our residents.""

Some past proposals for big industrial projects in the area have flopped, such as the LNG export facility that was abandoned two years ago. The company behind it sold its land and building permits to Simply Blue.

Long said past failures have left some residents ""leery,"" but he thinks generally people are open to new proposals. Nova Sustainable Fuels is hosting a community event this week to court community buy-in. Long said they already have council's support.

Nova Sustainable Fuels is hosting a community event this week to court community buy-in.","A proposed jet fuel megaproject on Nova Scotia's Eastern Shore is inching forward, with the proponents saying they plan to submit for environmental assessment before the fall.

The proposal is to produce sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, a lower-emission alternative to conventional jet fuel, and ship it by boat to distributors and airlines.

The project would include two components in Guysborough County — a joint wind and solar farm in St. Mary's and a plant in the community of Goldboro. The plant would use the wind and solar energy, as well as wood chips, to power hydrogen production. The hydrogen, in turn, would power the production of SAF.

Michael Galvin has been working on the idea for four years and said he's eager to make the project's first submission to the province. He expects the application for environmental assessment for the Goldboro plant will be made in early September.

Tough by Nature

Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is a perennial warm-season grass native to North America. It thrives on marginal land, tolerates drought and heat, and requires minimal fertilizer or irrigation — making it a strong candidate for sustainable biomass production.

High Energy Return

It produces six times more energy than is required to grow and harvest it. That energy ratio, combined with its ability to grow in regions unsuitable for food crops, gives it an edge in the bioenergy landscape.

Not Just Ethanol

Switchgrass isn’t just a source of traditional ethanol. It’s being considered for advanced biofuels like isobutanol and even sustainable aviation fuel via alcohol-to-jet pathways.

Drought Dilemma

When grown in drought conditions, switchgrass produces higher levels of compounds like saponins, which inhibit fermentation. That’s why researchers like Trey Sato are digging into how stress conditions affect downstream conversion.

Feedstock of the Future?

As climate change intensifies and the aviation sector looks to decarbonize, switchgrass may become a key player in next-generation fuel production — but only if its biological bottlenecks can be understood and addressed.",https://seedworld.com/cdn/wp-content/uploads/20250723145246/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-23-2025-02_50_56-PM.png,N,,2025-07-23 16:57:12.485428

President Trump is proving that when the United States leads from strength, the world follows—and America wins.","A HISTORIC TRADE AND INVESTMENT AGREEMENT WITH JAPAN: Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump announced a landmark economic agreement with Japan—one of America’s closest allies and most important trading partners.

This historic deal reflects the strength of the U.S.–Japan relationship and Japan’s recognition of the United States as the most attractive and secure destination for strategic investment in the world.

The agreement reaffirms the shared commitment of both nations to economic prosperity, industrial leadership, and long-term security. It delivers a powerful signal that the U.S.–Japan alliance is not only a cornerstone of peace in the Indo-Pacific, but also a driver of global growth and innovation.

With over $550 billion in a new Japanese/USA investment vehicle and enhanced access for American exports, this agreement marks a new chapter in bilateral cooperation—one that will unleash the full potential of the U.S. economy, strengthen vital supply chains, and support American workers, communities, and businesses for decades to come.

RESTORING AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL POWER: Japan will invest $550 billion directed by the United States to rebuild and expand core American industries.

This is the single largest foreign investment commitment ever secured by any country and will generate hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for generations.

At President Trump’s direction, these funds will be targeted toward the revitalization of America’s strategic industrial base, including:

Energy infrastructure and production, including LNG, advanced fuels, and grid modernization;

The United States will retain 90% of the profits from this investment—ensuring that American workers, taxpayers, and communities reap the overwhelming share of the benefit.

This capital surge, combined with the trillions already secured under President Trump’s leadership, will be a key component of a once-in-a-century industrial revival.

ENSURING BALANCED TRADE THROUGH A PREDICTABLE TARIFF FRAMEWORK: As part of this agreement, imports from Japan will be subject to a baseline 15% tariff rate.

In addition to raising billions in revenue, this new tariff framework, combined with expanded U.S. exports and investment-driven production, will help narrow the trade deficit with Japan and restore greater balance to the overall U.S. trade position.

This approach reflects the United States’ broader effort to establish a consistent, transparent, and enforceable trade environment—one in which American workers and producers are no longer disadvantaged by outdated or one-sided trade rules.

By aligning with this framework, Japan affirms the strength and mutual respect of the U.S.–Japan economic relationship and recognizes the importance of durable trade grounded in fairness.

SECURING INCREASED MARKET ACCESS FOR AMERICAN PRODUCERS: For decades, U.S. companies have faced barriers when seeking access to Japan’s market. This agreement delivers breakthrough openings across key sectors:

Agriculture and Food:

Japan will immediately increase imports of U.S. rice by 75%, with a major expansion of import quotas;

Japan will purchase $8 billion in U.S. goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.

Energy:

Major expansion of U.S. energy exports to Japan;

The US and Japan are exploring a new offtake agreement for Alaskan liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Manufacturing and Aerospace:

Japan has committed to purchase U.S.-made commercial aircraft, including an agreement to buy 100 Boeing aircraft;

Additional billions of dollars annually of purchases of U.S. defense equipment, enhancing interoperability and alliance security in the Indo-Pacific.

Automobiles and Industrial Goods:

Longstanding restrictions on U.S. cars and trucks will be lifted, granting U.S. automakers access to the Japanese consumer market; U.S. Automotive standards will be approved in Japan for the first time ever.

Broader openings for a range of industrial and consumer goods, leveling the playing field for American producers.

A GENERATIONAL SHIFT IN U.S.-JAPAN ECONOMIC RELATIONS: This agreement is not merely a trade deal—it is a strategic realignment of the U.S.-Japan economic relationship delivering for the American people.

For the first time, the terms of engagement place American industry, innovation, and labor at the center.

By securing historic investment and breaking open long-closed markets, President Trump has once again delivered a deal that no one else could deliver—a deal that will help to rebuild the American economy, strengthen our industrial foundation, and safeguard our national strength for decades to come.

President Trump is proving that when the United States leads from strength, the world follows—and America wins.

The manufactured fuel will be supplied to aviation companies in Northern Europe and exported to other markets around the world.

NorSAF will be the largest SAF production plant in Northern Europe producing approximately 100,000 tons of SAF annually once operations begin in 2030. The scope of the project is estimated at 500-600 million euros, depending on the selected technological solution. As this project will have to compete on a global scale, its successful implementation depends on the aid and support it receives from the European Union, institutional investors and local authorities.

Often referred to the future of aviation, SAF generates significantly less greenhouse gas emissions than conventional jet fuel. Starting this year, the European Union has implemented a requirement that at least 2% of all fuel consumed at larger airports must be SAF. This mandate will gradually increase, reaching 6% by 2030, 20% by 2035, and 70% by 2050.

Jonas Janukenas, CEO of the Group, emphasizes that the development of the aviation industry itself is now directly linked to new sustainability standards.

""The number of SAF production projects currently planned will likely be insufficient to meet the growing demand for sustainable aviation fuels in the coming years. EU regulations are mandating the increasing use of SAF, which will only ramp up year after year. Once complete, NorSAF will play a crucial role in ensuring that there is enough SAF available to the aviation industry,"" he says.

The ambitious project is the Group's first foray into the field of aviation fuel production. The Group’s subsidiary Baltic Ground Services was chosen to implement the technological part of the project because of their extensive experience with SAF supply and distribution.

The new facility in Latvia will use PureSAF technology, developed by Swedish Biofuels AB and exclusively licensed via the US engineering firm KBR. This technology has been proven to reduce GHG emissions by up to 93% compared to conventional jet fuels.

""It's important to understand that by 2030, there will be another important condition – 1.2% of all supplied SAF will have to be synthetic. This type of fuel is produced without the use biological components. Instead, green energy is used to produce hydrogen, which is then mixed with carbon dioxide. This mandate will also gradually increase, and by 2050, half of all SAF fuel will have to be synthetic. So, changes in the aviation sector are already happening at full speed,"" says Vytautas Cekanavicius, CEO of Baltic Ground Services and Board Member of NorSAF.

Using PureSAF technology, NorSAF will be able to produce both SAF and eSAF (a synthetic fuel derived from renewable energy) from bioethanol, hydrogen, and captured CO2. A complete green energy cycle will be a key feature of the completed project. Green electricity will power electrolysis for green hydrogen production, which will then be combined with captured CO₂ and ethanol to create both SAF and eSAF. The use of extracted CO2 in the production of the fuel will be particularly beneficial to the environment.

KBR is undertaking the feasibility study, which is expected to be completed by the second half of 2025. Work on the project is expected to commence shortly after that.

""A large part of the infrastructure we require is already present at the Liepaja Free Economic Zone. It has gas pipelines and railway lines, ethanol transshipment is already taking place here, and there are plans for a green hydrogen plant. Currently, negotiations are also underway with one large company from which we would purchase carbon dioxide and use part of it for synthetic SAF production,"" explains Vytautas Cekanavicius, Board Member of NorSAF.

Janis Kisiels, Board Member of NorSAF, is confident that the results of the feasibility study done by KBR will enable the start of work on the project this year, with the aim of being operational by 2030.

""This plant is a very good example of how companies from the region, working together, can implement large and truly ambitious projects contributing to aviation’s green transition. We aim to produce much more SAF fuel than will be needed for the entire Baltic countries' market, so we intend to export the majority of our produced SAF,"" he says.

It is estimated that the new Liepaja plant will produce 100,000 tons of SAF annually. For comparison, at the moment approximately 400,000 tons of aviation fuel are consumed across airports in the three Baltic states.

The demand for air travel, and therefore jet fuel, is growing year on year due to growth in emerging markets, increased air cargo traffic, and changing travel habits. Demand is already equating to pre-pandemic levels this year and will continue growing until at least 2050.

Many governments are turning to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable or waste-derived aviation fuels that meet the sustainability criteria under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), to help mitigate the resulting greenhouse gases. Globally, 28 SAF policies are in place or under development.

It is one of the most viable and scalable options for decarbonising aviation, with the potential to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% (Source: IATA). What makes the fuel more attractive is that it can be blended with conventional jet fuel without the need to change operating equipment, making it ideal for immediate use.

The World Economic Forum (WEF) predicts more than 17 million tonnes of SAF will be required by 2030. It can be made from renewable sources or waste products such as cooking oil or agricultural waste, and technologies are being developed to produce it from CO₂ and hydrogen. Despite this progress, a gap is expected to remain between the demand for SAF and global production capacity.

What is driving SAF demand?

One of the most influential policies when it comes to SAF uptake is the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive III (RED III). This mandates that greenhouse gas emissions from transport fuels should be reduced by 65%, rising to 70% for non-biological renewable transport fuels from January 2021. To support this, EU airports should use jet fuel with 2% SAF. This increases incrementally until 2050, when 63% of aviation fuel used by EU airports should be made up of SAF.

Further mandates and incentives have been put in place by the EU, such as the European Hydrogen Bank’s €3 billion support fund for hydrogen projects, including e-SAF.

Other regions have taken similar approaches. For example, the UK’s Jet Zero Strategy mandates that at least 10% of jet fuel must be made from sustainable sources by 2030. This strategy is accompanied by the £165 million Advanced Fuels Fund to kickstart the UK’s SAF industry.

The US government has taken an incentive-led approach, focusing on funding for research and tax credits. This includes $300 million of grants for research and development. In addition, until 2025, any sale of a qualified SAF mixture used and produced by a US taxpayer qualifies for a tax credit per gallon. This has the potential to increase depending on the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. The Biden administration introduced a number of initiatives to support the growth of the domestic SAF market, particularly tax credits and subsidies. However, red states favouring biofuels are likely to remain under the new government.

In Asia, SAF policies have started to be announced and proposed across the region, although the development remains uneven. Singapore, Japan, and China have announced SAF targets, while others are in various stages of proposal. While the policy environment is less advanced for SAF in Asia, policies are starting to develop across the region.

On a global scale, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aims to complement other carbon reduction schemes through CORSIA, which helps define the criteria and carbon intensity of sustainable aviation fuels.

SAF industry challenges: creating uncertainty

Developers in the SAF industry are facing a range of challenges. There is concern about tariffs, as well as the limited availability of feedstocks. Additionally, the industry is experiencing a widespread skills shortage.

One major challenge involves maturing technologies. Although hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) technologies have reached a high Technology Readiness Level (TRL), other SAF technologies are still developing at a commercial scale. These technologies have been proven at the concept and pilot plant stages, but still come with risks of performance and reliability at scale.

Feedstock availability is another factor. The suitability of a given technology and production scale often depends on feedstock access. Global locations offer a variety of feedstocks, but also pose challenges related to logistics, quality, and quantity. Existing local infrastructure is also a significant factor in feedstock logistics.

Local policies play an essential role. As SAF policies continue to be adopted globally, supportive local regulations will be needed to help launch and sustain the industry.

Higher capital expenditure (Capex) is also a concern. Based on KBR’s recent project experience, the cost of building new SAF production facilities is relatively high. Some projects have struggled to move into the construction phase due to difficulties securing loans. However, several key measures are recommended for new SAF developers: • Selecting appropriate technologies and feedstocks.

• Utilising existing infrastructure, including integration with refineries or storage terminals and product/feed logistics.

• Choosing plant locations with good logistics.

• Seeking lenders offering green funding at lower interest rates.

Choosing the right technology and construction method for each project is another important consideration.

As more countries move to mandate a minimum share of SAF in jet fuel, helping to meet this demand presents a significant business opportunity.

A range of SAF production pathways

There are multiple ways to create SAF, generally dependent on the feedstock used, with 11 conversion processes and 49 feedstocks currently widely accepted by organisations such as ASTM International. The ICAO goes one step further, requiring SAF to meet sustainability criteria to be eligible for CORSIA. The major conversion processes are explained below. Many of the processes are well known but are not yet widely used for SAF production.

Fischer-Tropsch hydroprocessed synthesised paraffinic kerosene (FT-SPK) uses a diverse range of feedstocks such as natural gas or biomass. The carbon intensity of this process is lower when powered by renewable energy sources. It also has a lower sulphur and aromatic content, which reduces the impact on aircraft engines. However, the production costs and hydrogen consumption are high, making it unviable.

Synthesised paraffinic kerosene from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) is fed by bio-oils, animal fat, or recycled oils. The used nature of the feedstock and low operating costs are appealing, but this is balanced by the low availability of feedstock and high start-up costs.",,N,,2025-07-23 17:56:57.628694

Carbon Neutral Fuels, a London-headquartered decarbonisation business, will receive a £6m grant from the Advanced Fuels Fund to take forward plans for a production plant in Workington.

CNF wants to develop a commercial scale plant that uses solid oxide electrolysis and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis technology to convert low carbon electricity and CO2 from direct air capture and biogenic sources into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

This is the third grant window opened by the Department for Transport. The government’s target is that by 2040, 22% of total jet fuel demand must be SAF, up from 2% today.

Company co-founder Alasdair Lumsden said: “This support comes as we enter FEED for our ASAP-DAC project in Cumbria. The facility will produce sustainable aviation fuel using power-to-liquid and direct air capture technologies, at commercial scale. It’s a first for the UK.”

Local MP Josh MacAlister said: “Over 2,000 jobs would be created during construction and over 50 direct full time jobs during operation. Located near the Port of Workington, the plant would produce 25,000 tonnes of green jet fuel per year, with an 89% reduction in emissions across the lifecycle of the fuel compared to current fossil jet fuel.

BOOK NOW: Energy & Power 2025

“The £6m government funding boost announced today is a real vote of confidence in our area and it will help to fast-track the project to a final investment decision. So, it isn’t 100% nailed down just yet, but we’re very close and I’ll keep working hard to make it happen in the weeks ahead.”

At Essar Energy Transition’s Stanlow hub, where a variety of projects are being progressed within the orbit of the oil refinery, £2.5m is pledged to take forward plans for a production facility converting methanol into SAF.

This methanol-to-jet hub could, said Essar, be capable of producing 200,000 tonnes per year of advanced SAF, using 550,000 tonnes per year of renewable e-methanol and bio-methanol sourced domestically in the UK and internationally, including from sister company Essar Future Energies, which is developing an e-methanol project in Gujarat.

A feasibility study has been completed this year, and the receipt of this grant from the AFF programme will enable Essar to advance to the pre-front-end engineering design stage.

Essar is targeting completion of this stage by March next year, with full front-end design taking place next summer ahead of a final investment decision by the end of 2027.

The MtJ production hub’s location at Stanlow, close to Ellesmere Port, will look to leverage the terminal’s existing import infrastructure, enabling access to the most competitive, low cost and low carbon intensity methanol feedstocks.

The existing refinery processing facilities, combined with low-carbon power, hydrogen and carbon capture facilities under development, also offer unique integration opportunities to create one of the lowest CI SAF production facilities in the UK, Essar said.

In January this year, Essar appointed Turkish contractor ENKA to deliver a low-carbon hydrogen production plant at Stanlow, a key part of the HyNet project. A £360m carbon capture plant is also in the works.

Essar Energy Transition’s established UK jet export infrastructure includes the Manchester Jet, Midlands, and UKOP oil pipeline systems, as well as existing road and marine distribution routes, allowing supply to regions across the UK. This infrastructure already supplies 10 UK airports including nearby Manchester International Airport.

The hub will be the most direct SAF supply point to the UK aviation sector, the firm said.

Tony Fountain, managing director at Essar Energy Transition, said: “We welcome the UK government’s support, which enables us to carry out a detailed pre-front-end engineering design process and accelerate this flagship UK advanced sustainable aviation fuels project towards final investment decision.

“At Stanlow, we have major decarbonisation ambitions, aiming to become a leading energy transition hub and home to the world’s first low-carbon process refinery. Domestic advanced SAF production is central to our long-term vision and a key catalyst for decarbonising aviation. With SAF still making up only a tiny fraction of global jet fuel use, our MtJ plant will play a critical role in closing that gap and helping the UK meet its Jet Zero targets.”",https://www.placenorthwest.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/essar-stanlow-overview-c-eet.jpg,N,,2025-07-23 11:57:22.606985

In a move that could punch well above its weight, French Polynesia is embracing zero-emission technology in aviation, thanks to a new collaboration between ATOBA Energy and local airline Air Moana.

Pioneering SAF in One of the World’s Most Remote Places

On July 22, 2025, ATOBA and Air Moana inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), laying the groundwork for a 10-year SAF partnership. This isn’t just a symbolic handshake; it’s a serious, long-term bet on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) transforming inter-island travel in Tahiti and the surrounding archipelago. The plan includes a mix of good old-fashioned physical fuel deliveries and a more modern twist: a “book and claim” system that helps bridge infrastructure gaps.

Out here, where hopping on a plane is more necessity than luxury, this is a big deal. With over 100 islands sprinkled across the sea, aviation is often the only way people, goods, and services move around. But all those flights come at an environmental cost—especially when the fuel powering them travels thousands of kilometers. That’s where SAF comes into play.

What’s SAF, and How Does ‘Book and Claim’ Help?

Sustainable aviation fuel is made from renewable sources—think waste oils, agricultural byproducts, and other biomass. Depending on how it’s produced, SAF can cut lifecycle emissions by as much as 80%. Even better, it works in existing aircraft with no modifications needed. Air Moana’s choice of ATR 72-600 aircraft, which are already pretty efficient, means every drop of SAF counts even more.

Now, let’s talk about that ‘book and claim’ model. It’s kind of like green energy certificates for aviation. The airline buys SAF credits, confirming the fuel was produced and injected into the system—even if it wasn’t pumped into their own planes. It’s a smart way to kickstart cleaner skies while the actual delivery infrastructure catches up in remote places like this.

This Is What a Long Game Looks Like

This isn’t a quick PR play or a one-off trial flight. With a bold 10-year offtake agreement, Air Moana becomes the first airline in the South Pacific to lock in SAF for the long haul. That kind of commitment sends a clear message to fuel producers and investors: there’s real momentum building here. And with early conversations already happening around setting up local production in Tahiti, this deal could pave the way for new infrastructure—and new jobs—down the line.

For ATOBA, the partnership also reflects a shift in strategy. They’re leaning into delivering SAF where it’s needed most but hardest to implement. With expertise spanning technology evaluation, market analysis, and negotiating the long-term deals that make everything tick, the France-based energy firm is helping level the playing field for small, remote airlines trying to do the right thing.

Beyond Emissions: Building Local Resilience

This isn’t just about reducing emissions—it’s also about rewriting the economic script. A healthy SAF market in the Pacific could eventually support homegrown refining, creating local jobs, encouraging skills development, and diversifying economies that rely heavily on tourism and fisheries. And in a place that’s already feeling the impacts of rising seas and changing weather patterns, that kind of green resilience isn’t just nice to have—it’s vital.

Of course, no road is without bumps. SAF still costs more than traditional fuel. And some folks aren’t sold on the certificate system, arguing that emissions cuts should happen where they’re claimed. Valid points. This makes transparency, smart governance, and a steady move toward actual fuel deliveries all the more important to keep the trust and momentum going.

Zooming Out: A Global Movement with Local Flavor

Big headlines about green hydrogen and SAF adoption often come from places like Europe or California—where policy tools, funding, and infrastructure make things easier. But many remote regions lag not because of a lack of vision, but simply because they don’t have the same resources. That’s why this partnership stands out. It’s a homegrown solution, with both eyes on the long term, in one of the most challenging—and crucial—settings for sustainable energy transitions.

The association is collecting letters of support from across the business aviation industry until the end of August.

The current regulation mandates that operators uplift at least 90% of their annual fuel at EU airports. Intended to reduce emissions, EBAA says the measure creates safety risks, operational disruptions and administrative burdens for small aircraft operators. It also claims environmental benefits are marginal at best, and in some cases, counterproductive.

A new Deloitte analysis of the European Union’s ReFuelEU Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandate suggests that the climate-centric rule could unintentionally deter travelers from using European carriers and hubs, potentially adding cost and complexity to trips that originate, connect, or terminate in Brussels and other EU cities.

What the ReFuelEU mandate asks of airlines

Under ReFuelEU, airlines operating from European airports must steadily increase the proportion of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blended into every gallon of jet fuel they load. The regulation is a cornerstone of the bloc’s plan to decarbonize aviation, yet still accommodate the millions of people who rely on air travel for work and leisure. Unlike carbon offset programs, the SAF rule directly targets aircraft emissions by substituting a portion of fossil-based kerosene with bio- or synthetic alternatives.

Deloitte’s study, prepared for industry trade group Airlines for Europe, contends the mandate could prove more disruptive than policymakers anticipate. The research team modeled ticket prices on long-haul flights, comparing European carriers bound by the SAF quota to competitors operating from hubs in Istanbul, Dubai, and Doha. Those non-EU airlines face no comparable requirement and can therefore buy traditional jet fuel at today’s lower market price.

A potential 15 percent difference by 2030

The price gap is not trivial. “Cost disparities could rise by up to 15 percent on key EU–Asia routes by 2030,” Deloitte wrote in the study. In a statement, the company said. For a family of four planning a European summer vacation in Southeast Asia, the differential might translate into hundreds of euros, enough to make a one-stop itinerary via Istanbul or Dubai look far more attractive than a direct flight on a European flag carrier.

Why travelers could feel the pinch

Airlines typically pass additional operating costs on to passengers. If meeting the SAF requirement adds several euros to every long-haul ticket, price-sensitive travelers may book through non-EU hubs or even shift their vacation entirely outside the bloc, the report warns. Such “carbon and business leakage” undermines the EU’s climate goals because the flight happens anyway—just with tanks full of cheaper, more polluting fuel loaded elsewhere.

Besides higher fares, European passengers might confront reduced nonstop options. As ticket sales migrate to non-EU carriers, European airlines could trim or cancel marginal routes, forcing travelers onto less convenient schedules or multiple connections.

SAF-BAM: An accounting fix on the table

To preserve environmental ambition while leveling the commercial playing field, Deloitte proposes a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Book and Claim Accounting Mechanism, or SAF-BAM. The concept is similar to renewable energy certificates in the power sector.

Airlines purchase SAF where it is most readily available—perhaps at a U.S. refinery or a Nordic biofuel complex—and earn digital certificates that represent the environmental benefits.

Those certificates can be claimed against any flight, even if the physical fuel uplift takes place elsewhere.

Revenue from buying certificates would be channeled into additional green aviation projects across Europe.

Because the mechanism decouples where SAF is burned from who pays, it reduces the incentive to exploit non-EU hubs solely to escape higher fuel costs. Deloitte argues the approach also avoids the legal hurdles of extending the EU’s existing Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)—currently applied to steel, cement, and other goods—to the aviation sector.

What this means for your next trip

For now, the numbers in the Deloitte model are projections, not hard-wired increases. Airlines typically hedge fuel purchases months in advance, and some have long-term SAF supply agreements that could buffer initial price shocks. Still, frequent flyers and vacation planners should watch how major European carriers respond in the run-up to 2030.

Tips for Travelers

Compare hubs: When shopping for long-haul tickets, check fares via EU airports such as Brussels, Frankfurt, or Paris against similar routings through Istanbul or Dubai. A small detour could save money, although it may add to the travel time.

Monitor fuel surcharges: Airlines often break out a “carrier-imposed surcharge” on your fare. Rising SAF costs may appear first here.

Leverage loyalty programs: If European airlines raise cash prices, redeeming frequent-flyer miles may offer better value than spending euros.

Watch for SAF opt-in programs: Some carriers already let passengers pay a bit extra to guarantee a portion of SAF on their flight. Participation could become mandatory later; locking in voluntary rates now may be more cost-effective.

Consider the carbon math: Even if a non-EU routing is cheaper, remember that extra connecting flights generally increase total emissions and travel time.

The bottom line for flyers

Europe is serious about decarbonizing aviation, but good intentions can collide with market realities. Unless policymakers fine-tune ReFuelEU—or adopt a SAF-BAM system—travelers may find themselves weighing higher prices for direct flights against longer, cheaper itineraries outside the bloc. Either way, understanding the forces reshaping the fare you pay will help you book smarter, greener trips in the years ahead.",https://jetsetterguide.com/sites/default/files/2024-02/AdobeStock_311641578.jpeg,N,,2025-07-23 12:56:20.088337

The paper details how Syzygy's NovaSAF™ platform offers a scalable, policy-aligned, and economically viable pathway to decarbonize aviation.

""NovaSAF™ is more than a product—it's a policy enabler,"" said Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics. ""This white paper shows how technology innovation can help regulators and industry meet climate goals while unlocking new economic opportunities.""

As global regulators accelerate efforts to reduce aviation emissions, SAF demand is expected to exceed 200 million metric tons annually by 2050. However, current supply falls short by more than 120 million metric tons. NovaSAF™ addresses this gap by converting biogenic methane and carbon dioxide into ASTM-certified SAF using light-activated catalysts and renewable electricity. This process reduces equipment costs, leverages widely available feedstocks, and delivers strong project returns. Altogether, this pathway is generally at or lower cost than HEFA and can even achieve Jet-A parity in the right scenarios.

Crucially, NovaSAF™ meets both SAF and eSAF (electrofuels) requirements under the EU's RED III directive and the UK's Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO). A NovaSAF plant will create SAF with two separate qualifications, a portion of the volume produced will qualify as an Advanced Biofuel, and the remaining portion will qualify as a Renewable Fuel of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO). This dual compliance enables access to premium SAF markets and supports long-term investment viability.

The paper highlights how NovaSAF is enabled by Syzygy's Rigel reactor technology, which is powered by renewable electricity and eliminates the need to combust fossil fuels. This critical piece is then combined with the well-established Fischer-Tropsch technology to turn the biogas into a liquid that can then be hydrotreated to create SAF. A final critical element are Syzygy's innovations around these technologies together into a modular system, which enables distributed, site-adaptable production.

It also features Syzygy's first commercial project, NovaSAF 1, located in Uruguay. This facility will convert manure from 14,000 cows into 400,000 gallons (1,100 tons) of SAF annually, powered by a national grid that is over 90 percent renewable. The project demonstrates the platform's scalability and its potential to reduce both methane and aviation-related emissions.

Syzygy's strategy focuses on scaling SAF production through repeatable project execution and technology licensing, aiming to meet the growing demand for low-carbon aviation fuels over the next 25 years.

A GPIF spokesperson told Responsible Investor that allocation size will depend on the RFP results.

The Luxembourg Finance Labelling Agency (LuxFLAG) has clarified to RI that changes to its ESG label’s eligibility criteria do not mean that European funds will no longer need to comply with the EU’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) to qualify for the label. In its updated guidance, LuxFLAG had stated that being classified as Article 8 or 9 under the regime is “no longer a prerequisite” for being eligible to the ESG label. “This adjustment supports LuxFLAG’s global outreach,” the agency said. However, LuxFLAG has clarified that this only refers to funds outside the scope of SFDR. “So far, our footprint is mostly European with few non-eligible requests because of the product jurisdiction,” a spokesperson said. “This criteria update will unlock these possibilities and will make eligible non-EU products from existing product manufacturers based outside the EU.”

Regarding the upcoming SFDR review, the spokesperson said LuxFLAG remains aligned with the framework “but believe a more inclusive and international approach is necessary to address the growing interest in credible, third-party sustainability labels”. They added that LuxFLAG is “highly likely” to adapt accordingly, should SFDR be reviewed.

Several changes have been made to LuxFLAG’s criteria “in line with evolving market practices and stakeholder expectations”. These include requiring asset managers of labelled products to be signatories of a “recognised” responsible investment framework and for ESG due diligence to be systematically integrated into the investment process for 100 percent of portfolio holdings, as well as refinements to the terminology for exclusions and engagement. The updates aim to ensure continued robustness, international alignment and improved accessibility for a broader range of financial products, LuxFLAG said.

The Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI) has urged the Japanese government to address its dependence on fossil fuel imports by accelerating its national transition strategy – called the Green Transformation (GX) strategy. A briefing from CBI warned that the reliance on hydrocarbons, particularly on natural gas, “has become a critical vulnerability amid escalating geopolitical instability” and is inconsistent with Japan’s 2050 net-zero target. The NGO also noted that the construction of new gas plants with the assumption that carbon capture, ammonia and hydrogen could be used to replace gas in the future is predicated on “transition pathways [that] are currently unproven and uncertain”.

European residential real estate companies are facing manageable transition risks up to 2030, although tighter environmental policies could increase debt “materially”, according to new analysis by S&P Global Ratings. The ratings agency said the passthrough of utility costs and diversification of asset portfolios have helped shield companies in the sample against the credit impact of climate transition risks over the past few years, but that more stringent regulation could result in a one-notch lower rating for 10 of the 15 firms assessed.

Europe’s success in decarbonising its energy sector is being offset by rising emissions from aviation, according to new analysis by Barclays. A note published by the bank found that aviation emits more CO2 than the power sectors of both France and Portugal, as the aviation industry refocuses its decarbonisation pathway from electric and hydrogen powered aircraft towards sustainable aviation fuel and offsets. “The fresh political and environmental situation that has arisen from the new US administration has seen European airlines question the lack of a level playing field between European airlines and global competitors,” the analysts said, noting industry scepticism over the energy sector’s ability to support the production of sufficient sustainable aviation fuel.",https://media.responsible-investor.com/uploads/2024/07/admin-ajax.jpeg,N,,2025-07-23 11:57:42.939308

Syzygy Plasmonics has recently released a transformative white paper titled ""Solving the SAF Trilemma: Cost, Feedstock, and Financeability."" This essential document articulates a fresh perspective on producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and highlights the company's innovative NovaSAF™ platform. Their methodology integrates scalable solutions that align with current policies and economic realities, making it a viable path to reducing carbon emissions in aviation.

NovaSAF™: A Game-Changer in Aviation Fuel Production

Trevor Best, the CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics, stated, ""NovaSAF™ is more than a product—it's a policy enabler."" This sentiment underscores the potential of this new white paper showing how technological advancements can align regulatory frameworks with industry needs, further supporting climate action and creating economic possibilities.

The Demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

With global regulators intensifying commitments to cut aviation emissions, the demand for SAF is projected to soar. By 2050, forecasts suggest a need exceeding 200 million metric tons of SAF annually. However, the currently available supply falls significantly short, with a gap of over 120 million metric tons. The NovaSAF™ initiative aims to address this critical shortfall. It converts biogenic methane and carbon dioxide into ASTM-certified SAF, utilizing innovative light-activated catalysts and renewable electricity. Such a method not only diminishes overall equipment costs but also takes advantage of widely accessible feedstocks and yields strong returns on projects.

A Cost-Effective Approach to SAF Production

One of the standout features of the NovaSAF™ process is its ability to deliver SAF at costs comparable to or below traditional hydrogenated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) technologies. This opens doors for potential scenarios where it can achieve cost parity with conventional jet fuels, such as Jet-A.

Regulatory Compliance and Market Access

NovaSAF™ successfully meets both SAF and eSAF (electrofuels) requirements as outlined by the European Union's RED III directive and the UK's Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO). The production from a NovaSAF plant will yield SAF with two separate classifications: an Advanced Biofuel and a Renewable Fuel of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO). This dual compliance grants access to premium SAF markets and strengthens the long-term viability of investments in sustainable fuel technology.

Powering NovaSAF™ with Renewable Energy

Central to the NovaSAF™ technology is Syzygy's Rigel reactor, which leverages renewable energy to eliminate fossil fuel combustion in the production process. This advancement pairs seamlessly with established Fischer-Tropsch technology, which transforms biogas into liquid fuels suitable for further processing into SAF. Notably, the integration of these technologies into a modular system enhances the adaptability of production sites, making them capable of delivering localized solutions.

First Commercial Project and Future Prospects

Highlighting the practical applications of NovaSAF™, the paper discusses Syzygy's inaugural commercial project, NovaSAF 1. This innovative facility, situated in a region with over 90 percent renewable energy, will transform manure produced by 14,000 cows into 400,000 gallons (1,100 tons) of SAF annually. This project not only demonstrates the scalability of the NovaSAF™ platform but also promises to mitigate both methane emissions and those associated with aviation.

Syzygy's strategic commitment centers on increasing the production of SAF through consistent project execution and technology licensing. The company aims to meet the burgeoning demand for low-carbon aviation fuels over the forthcoming 25 years, ensuring that its sustainable solutions are both economically and environmentally sound.

The updates aimed to reduce the carbon intensity of the state’s transportation fuel by 30% by 2030 and by 90% by 2045, the 8 July report said.
“Implementing the 1 July effective date for the LCFS provides critical certainty to industry, as well as the LCFS credit market,” said CARB Board Chair Liane Randolph.
CARB said the amendments would reduce GHG emissions by 558M tonnes between 2025 and 2045.

The updates aimed to reduce the carbon intensity of the state’s transportation fuel by 30% by 2030 and by 90% by 2045, the 8 July report said.

Other changes to the LCFS programme included a requirement for fuel producers to track crop-based and forestry-based feedstocks to their point of origin; independent feedstock certification to ensure biomass-based diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstocks are not undermining natural carbon stocks; a halt to palm-derived fuels receiving credits; and a cap on the use of soyabean oil, canola oil and sunflower oil in the production of LCFS-compliant biodiesel diesel fuels, Biodiesel magazine wrote.

The amended regulation focuses public and private sector investment towards increasing cleaner fuel and transportation options for Californians, accelerating the deployment of zero-emission infrastructure and helping the state achieve legally mandated air quality and climate targets, CARB said on 27 June.

“Implementing the 1 July effective date for the LCFS provides critical certainty to industry, as well as the LCFS credit market,” said CARB Board Chair Liane Randolph.

“But often lost in the noise around this programme are our primary reasons for approving it: better health for Californians, our economy and the environment, as well as achieving required state and federal air quality standards.”

The LCFS reduces air pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by setting a declining target for the carbon in transportation fuels used in California; producers that do not meet established benchmarks buy credits from others that do.

CARB said the amendments would reduce GHG emissions by 558M tonnes between 2025 and 2045.

Since its introduction, the LCFS had reduced the carbon in California’s fuel mix by almost 13% and replaced 75% of the diesel used in the state with cleaner alternatives, displacing 320M tonnes of CO2 since 2011, the board added.

California consumes most of the renewable diesel produced in the USA, with the fuel making up nearly 65% of its transportation distillate consumption in the third quarter of 2024, according to US Energy Information Administration (EIA) data.

In November 2024, renewable diesel production on the US West Coast (including California, Oregon and Washington) exceeded 90,000 barrels/day, nearly four times the volume in 2023, with refiners such as Marathon Martinez and Phillips 66 Rodel significantly expanding capacity, Mansfield Energy wrote on 3 March.",https://www.ofimagazine.com/content-images/news/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/Biofuel-Adobe-Stock-sized-23-Sept.jpg?mtime=1723017510,N,,2025-07-23 11:57:54.183622

This year, there are a record number of thermal biomass projects, ranging from support for existing and new small wood pellet plants making pellets for domestic heating, expansion of firewood businesses, larger biomass thermal heating plants, etc. Of the $80 million, at least $12 million went to more than 30 projects in 19 states that involved thermal biomass applications. In addition, quite a few projects include biomass to electricity.

""Firewood, pellets and wood chips - these are domestic renewable energy sources that America needs for heating our homes, institutions and businesses,"" said John Ackerly, President of the Alliance for Green Heat. ""They help take strain off of our electric grids, they are affordable for rural communities and sustainable.""

The Alliance for Green Heat was not eligible for funding for firewood bank assistance through this grant process but has been advocating for an extension of the funding established through a Congressional earmark.

The program was founded in 2015, under President Obama, in part to mitigate the impacts of climate change, as wildfires began to increase. It also sought to assist using low grade wood as an energy source. Overall, it has supported the forestry industry in many ways, but from its founding in 2015 until 2021, the budget was relatively small, around $8 million. As of 2022, as wildfire risks became even greater, and with funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, funding began to climb rapidly and reached $74 million last year.

The $80 million announced July 17 includes grants under three programs:

The Wood Innovations Grant Program supports projects that expand the use of wood products, including firewood and pellets

The Community Wood Grant Program helps fund ready-to-go, local projects that use wood for heat and energy.

The Wood Products Infrastructure Assistance Program funds facilities that purchase and process byproducts from forest restoration projects from federal or tribal lands.

The sport’s global fanbase has grown to more than 826 million and race attendance has reached more than six million.
How can you look at the solutions that work in Formula 1, at mass events with hundreds of thousands of people, globally?
Alongside this, Ellen feels that F1 is uniquely set up to support the development and amplification of new technologies.","Formula 1’s Sustainability Update 2025 says that the organisation is on track to reach its goal of net zero by 2030.

It has achieved a 26% reduction in carbon emissions at the end of 2024 compared to its 2018 baseline.

Over the same period, race attendance has grown from four million to 6.5 million and F1’s global fanbase is now more than 826 million.

If no changes had been made to operations, F1 estimates that there would have been a 10% increase in its carbon footprint.

Stefano Domenicali, President and CEO of Formula 1, said in the report: “We are strongly committed to achieving net zero by 2030. It is a concrete goal, already visible in the significant reduction of our sport’s carbon footprint.

“Formula 1 has always been synonymous with innovation and the desire to improve.

“Once again, this mentality has allowed us to make important progress, not only for those who work in this world, but also for society as a whole.”

Driving sustainability at Formula 1

Ellen Jones, Head of ESG at Formula 1, leads the business’ sustainability strategy.

She joined the business in 2022 with previous experience from Pret A Manger and Accenture.

Ellen earned a BA in Architecture from Yale University and an MS in Sustainable Environmental Design from the Architectural Association School of Architecture.

“Not only do I get to work in the wonderful four walls of Formula 1 management, looking at broadcast and logistics, but I also get to work across our sport with F1 teams, our race promoters who are event hosts and our broadcasters,” Ellen tells Sustainability Magazine.

“What we have tried to do as a sport is ask how we can take climate action now and explore how we can do so much more together, whether that's through partnerships or through shared solutions.

“It's a real balance of individual activity within the organisations that make up our sport, as well as shared activity across the stakeholders who all love the races.”

Behind F1’s 2030 net zero goal

By 2030, F1 aims to reach net zero against a 2018 baseline with a minimum 50% emissions reduction target.

“Being Formula 1, we want to beat that number,” Ellen says.

“When we do exhaust the reductions phase, we will look at what are credible offsets at that time.”

She explains: “In our sustainability strategy, you have things that are different from a normal bricks and mortar because it's about the relationships that we have across the sport.

“We also look to make a unique contribution as Formula 1 by developing road relevant solutions. You see that in our cars with hybrid engines and you'll see that in our cars in 2026 with advanced sustainable fuel.

“How those two cross pollinate is what I find fascinating. How we innovate on track and how that culture, mindset and knowledge of the technical innovation space helps us innovate off track.”

Influencing global sustainability

Formula 1’s unique position in sustainability also extends to its influence and fans.

The sport’s global fanbase has grown to more than 826 million and race attendance has reached more than six million.

“From our side, we have two different conversations when you talk about the platform,” Ellen explains.

“One is a B2C conversation with our fans about being part of something bigger and supporting change by being at a Formula 1 race. You're part of this progression that's able to happen.

“The second is a B2B conversation. How do we talk to businesses about what solutions you can integrate today? How can you look at the solutions that work in Formula 1, at mass events with hundreds of thousands of people, globally?

“If we can do that across those contexts and give case studies of what works, then hopefully it can inspire other businesses to say ‘if this works for Formula 1, it can work for us’.”

Challenges and opportunities for sustainability in F1

Reducing emissions by 26% brings F1 more than halfway to its goal of reducing emissions 50%, but more needs to be done yet.

Ellen explains that F1, like many businesses, faces challenges in changing mindsets on sustainability.

However, with a history tied to burning race fuel and shredding rubber, perceptions in motorsport could be harder to change.

“Sustainability and performance are better delivered together and we have those examples within F1 every day showing that when you build sustainability from the front into your strategy, you're not making compromises on what is delivered,” she says.

Despite an increase in both number of events and attendance, F1 has achieved a 12% reduction in its average per-event energy emissions showing that growth and emissions can be decoupled.

Alongside this, Ellen feels that F1 is uniquely set up to support the development and amplification of new technologies.

“You have to look at if it can scale, making sure it’s available in different markets and marking sure customers and auditors understand that technology and how it’s implemented,” Ellen explains.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/45e209580b4c1a8bab87753e64facfb5:5242e14c99471e02aefb71c8b25b43b1/ellen-jones-head-of-esg-at-formula-1.webp.jpg,N,,2025-07-23 11:58:03.831913

The plant will rely on approximately 550,000 tonnes of renewable e-methanol and bio-methanol each year, sourced both from within the UK and internationally. A portion of this methanol will be supplied by Essar Future Energies, a sister company currently developing a renewable methanol project in Gujarat, India.

With a feasibility study successfully completed earlier in 2025, the new grant will allow the project to progress to the Pre-Front-End Engineering Design (pre-FEED) stage. This phase is scheduled for completion by March 2026, followed by the start of the full Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) in Q2 2026. Essar anticipates reaching a Final Investment Decision (FID) by the end of 2027.

Stanlow’s strategic location offers several advantages, including the presence of existing import infrastructure at Stanlow Terminals. This enables access to competitively priced, low-carbon-intensity methanol feedstocks. The site also benefits from existing refining capabilities, along with upcoming low-carbon power, hydrogen production, and carbon capture infrastructure, allowing for a fully integrated low-emission SAF facility.

The SAF produced at this hub will be distributed through Essar’s extensive jet fuel logistics network, which includes the Manchester Jet Line, Midlands and UKOP pipelines, as well as road and marine routes. This system currently supplies fuel to 10 UK airports, including Manchester International, positioning the facility as a key direct supplier to the UK aviation industry. SAF will be blended on-site with existing jet fuel supplies to ensure seamless integration into the current distribution network.

Moreover, the Stanlow hub is designed with scalability in mind. As SAF demand increases in the coming decades, the site offers potential for significant expansion. Integration with other Essar Energy Transition businesses—EET Fuels, EET Hydrogen, and EET Hydrogen Power—will further support Stanlow’s evolution into a leading energy transition complex.

EET Managing Director Tony Fountain expressed strong support for the government’s role in enabling this transition, stating that domestic SAF production is crucial for aviation decarbonisation and national Jet Zero goals. The MtJ hub will be instrumental in closing the gap in global SAF supply, which remains a small fraction of total jet fuel use.

The initiative aligns with the UK’s SAF Mandate, which came into effect in January 2025. The mandate sets phased targets, requiring 22% of aviation fuel to come from SAF by 2040—up from just 2% today. This MtJ project will help EET meet its own SAF obligations under the mandate by 2035. The £2.5m grant is part of a broader £63 million AFF allocation for SAF projects between July 2025 and March 2026, with further government incentives and policy support expected to follow.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-23 11:58:43.634858

However, rigid carbon intensity (CI) accounting procedures in current policies may limit CI responsiveness across candidate sites and facilities.

Work published in the journal ACS Sustainable Resource Management examines a hypothetical biomass-to-sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) process to demonstrate how GHG accounting requirements drive estimates of biofuel CI and to explore potential CI and financial implications of scenario-specific life cycle assessment (LCA).

The CI of hypothetical SAF produced from miscanthus via the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) pathway was calculated according to specifications from three low-carbon fuel policies (U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), Canada Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR), and California Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), and the 45Z tax credit.

These were compared against modeling results tailored to specific feedstock-to-fuel scenarios (scenario-specific LCA) defined by feedstock and facility siting and feedstock split ratio (the proportion of miscanthus allocated to fuel production vs. electricity).

GHG accounting using the CFR/LCFS can reasonably account for distinct levels of net electricity production by a biorefinery, but only the CFR yields similar CI sensitivity to spatially explicit factors as scenario-specific LCA. Most GHG accounting frameworks do not capture CI variation across candidate sites in the United States.

This funding is designated to support the advancement of LanzaTech’s pivotal DRAGON 1 and DRAGON 2 projects—two initiatives aimed at transforming the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) landscape in the UK. The DRAGON initiative, which stands for Decarbonizing and Reimagining Aviation for the Goal Of Netzero, is central to the UK’s goal of achieving a cleaner and more sustainable aviation sector.

The DRAGON 1 project is LanzaTech’s existing SAF development located in Port Talbot, South Wales. This facility converts recycled carbon fuel ethanol—some of which is produced through LanzaTech’s proprietary gas fermentation technology—into advanced sustainable aviation fuel using the LanzaJet® Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) process. This ethanol-to-SAF pathway is gaining recognition as one of the most effective and scalable solutions for decarbonizing air travel.

DRAGON 2 represents the next step in LanzaTech’s SAF ambitions. It will be a Power-to-Liquid (PtL) facility that synthesizes ethanol from captured carbon dioxide and green hydrogen. This ethanol will then be processed into SAF at a neighboring site using the same LanzaJet® AtJ technology. The specific location for DRAGON 2 is yet to be finalized and will be determined during the course of this grant-funded phase.

What sets these projects apart is the integration of LanzaTech’s carbon recycling platform with LanzaJet’s conversion technology. By utilizing locally sourced waste carbon and renewable hydrogen, the combined approach delivers SAF with a significantly lower Carbon Intensity (CI). This not only supports the UK’s SAF Mandate but also promotes industrial revitalization, job creation, and regional economic growth.

Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech, emphasized the significance of this funding: “The future of aviation fuel lies in ethanol-to-SAF solutions, and LanzaTech is leading this transition.

On Monday 21 July, Aviation Minister Mike Kane MP visited the university to announce the funding. Sheffield will lead a £1.5 million initiative aimed at commercialising its novel SAF technology and encouraging investment in future production facilities to boost the availability of the cleaner fuel.

The scheme, known as NextGen-SAF, brings together a partnership of international and UK-based organisations, including Fuel Cell Energy (USA), Green Lizard Technologies (UK), Drax Power (UK), IMI Vivo (Italy), Gardner Consulting (UK), and Leeds Bradford Airport (UK). The project has also garnered backing from major players such as Airbus, Boeing, Qatar Airways, and the City of Doncaster Council.

While SAF is often made from organic or waste materials, concerns remain over whether those resources can be scaled to meet demand. The University of Sheffield’s new method bypasses these limitations by using renewable energy in tandem with advanced carbon capture systems to create fuel.

This innovative approach, known as Power to Liquid (PtL), involves producing hydrogen through renewable electricity and capturing carbon dioxide from industrial sources or the atmosphere. These are combined to form synthetic hydrocarbons, which are then refined into usable aviation fuel.

Not only could this technique make SAF more cost-effective, but it also allows greater flexibility and the potential to cut emissions across industrial sectors.

NextGen-SAF will create a pioneering demonstration plant that integrates two core technologies: a Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) and an Advanced Fischer-Tropsch (AFT) reactor. Together, these systems will generate hydrogen, capture CO2, and synthesise hydrocarbons, offering a fully integrated route to SAF production. The goal is to prove the system’s efficiency, stability, and scalability.

“We are proud to lead this project, made possible by this vital funding, to develop a new and innovative SAF production pathway. Sustainable Aviation Fuel is essential to reducing emissions from the aviation industry, and through this project we are taking a major step toward scaling up SAF production right here in the UK. This initiative not only advances the UK’s goals around SAF but also strengthens the nation’s fuel production capabilities and will deliver lasting economic benefits.”

Professor Koen Lamberts, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sheffield.

The Sheffield project is one of 17 receiving a share of £63 million in government funding to speed up SAF development.

“This £63 million is lift-off for Britain’s green aviation revolution. We’re not just backing brilliant British innovation; we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market.

From the labs of Sheffield to the runways of the future – this is how we kickstart economic growth, secure energy independence, and make Britain a clean energy superpower.”

Mike Kane, Aviation Minister.

Sheffield has earned a global reputation for its SAF research, hosting some of Europe’s top clean energy facilities at its Energy Innovation Centre. These include pilot-scale systems designed to support industry and academic partnerships in trialling cutting-edge low-carbon technologies.

The University is also home to the UK SAF Clearing House, one of only two such centres worldwide, which helps fuel developers meet the strict certification standards required for aviation use.

Sheffield’s expertise was also instrumental in the world’s first transatlantic flight powered by SAF, during which its researchers measured the impact of the fuel on emissions and contrail formation. Their analysis revealed emission cuts of up to 70 per cent.

“It is fantastic to see the University of Sheffield playing a leading role in the development of sustainable aviation fuel and supporting the aviation industry in its efforts to reduce its emissions. At Sheffield we have some of the most advanced SAF research facilities in Europe and are excited to work with partners from the industry to help them test and develop new fuels and next generation clean energy technologies.”

The new LanaTech allocation boosts total government contributions through the Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF) to £198 million (US$268 million).","LanzaTech Global received a grant of £6.4 million (US$8.7 million) from the UK government’s Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF), operated by the Department for Transport (DfT). The grant will accelerate the development of LanzaTech’s DRAGON 1 & 2 projects, each playing a role in the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the UK. Project DRAGON stands for Decarbonizing and Reimagining Aviation for the Goal Of Netzero.

The DRAGON 1 project is LanzaTech’s existing UK SAF project that will convert recycled carbon fuel ethanol (including ethanol from LanzaTech’s gas fermentation process) into Advanced SAF in Port Talbot, South Wales, using the LanzaJet Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) process.

The DRAGON 2 project is a Power-to-Liquid (PtL) facility that will convert waste carbon dioxide and green hydrogen into ethanol for subsequent conversion into PtL SAF at an adjacent facility using the LanzaJet Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) process. The location for DRAGON 2 in the UK will be determined during this grant-funded project.

Integrating LanzaTech’s gas fermentation process with LanzaJet’s AtJ technology gives this approach a distinctive edge, the company says. By turning regional waste resources into valuable SAF, LanzaTech facilitates the production of low Carbon Intensity (CI) fuels, contributing positively to the UK’s SAF Mandate and supporting economic growth and job creation in industrial zones in the UK.

Separately, Project Speedbird by LanzaJet, in which LanzaTech holds a 36% ownership stake, also received recognition and £10 million (US$13.5 million) in funding from the Advanced Fuels Fund. In 2024, LanzaTech and LanzaJet partnered to create CirculAir, that transforms nearly any form of waste carbon (including CO2, MSW, agri residues) into SAF, combining the technologies of both companies to provide the aviation industry with a solution to produce waste-based SAF on a global scale.

Fuels giant Essar Energy Transition (EET) is to develop one of the UK’s largest sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production hubs close to the River Mersey.

EET operates the second-largest oil refinery in the UK at Stanlow in Ellesmere Port. It already supplies conventional jet fuel via either road or pipeline to 10 UK airports including Liverpool and Manchester.

SAF is jet fuel produced from a variety of sources including household waste, used cooking oil as well as forestry and agricultural waste. Because it is a ‘drop-in fuel’ it means it can be blended with conventional jet fuel without any modifications.

Powering aircraft is one of the big conundrums of the push towards cutting CO2 emissions. A commercial airliner requires significant power to take off and travel long distances.

There have been trials using both batteries and hydrogen but so far these have proven challenging. SAF is currently seen as the best way to keep flying but reduce emissions.

It is claimed SAF can reduce emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel although critics say it simply shifts some of those emissions to other parts of the supply chain. SAF is also more expensive.

EET has secured £2.5m from the Government to establish an SAF hub at Stanlow. It plans to use methanol-to-jet technology to convert renewable e-methanol and bio-methanol into SAF. Stanlow is also the nerve centre for the multi-billion pound HyNet hydrogen project.

Leveraging Stanlow Terminals existing import infrastructure enables access to low carbon intensity methanol feedstocks. SAF will be blended on-site with EET Fuels’ existing jet fuel production to directly supply UK airports.

This hub will have the capacity to produce 200,000 tonnes a year if SAF, using 550,000 tonnes of renewable e-methanol and bio-methanol sourced domestically in the UK and from its sister company – Essar Future Energies – in Gujarat, India.

The Department for Transport has offered the funding from its £63m Advanced Fuels Fund. EET can now advance to the pre-front-end engineering design (pre-FEED) stage. It is targeting completion of pre-FEED by March 2026, with full FEED commencing in Q2 2026 and final investment decision by the end of 2027.

Tony Fountain, managing director at EET, said: “We welcome the UK Government’s support, which enables us to carry out a detailed FEED process and accelerate this flagship UK advanced sustainable aviation fuels project towards final investment decision.

“At Stanlow, we have major decarbonisation ambitions, aiming to become a leading energy transition hub and home to the world’s first low-carbon process refinery.

“Domestic advanced SAF production is central to our long-term vision and a key catalyst for decarbonising aviation.”",https://lbndaily.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9480-e1753193012781.jpg,N,,2025-07-23 06:57:21.651210

The plant will be located in the Liepāja Special Economic Zone (LSEZ), Latvia, through the newly formed joint venture NorSAF, in collaboration with local partners.

The NorSAF facility is expected to begin operations in 2030, delivering up to 100,000 tonnes of SAF annually.

Estimated investment in the project ranges between €500 million and €600 million, with financial backing sought from EU funds, institutional investors, and public sector stakeholders.

The plant will serve both regional airlines and global markets, supporting the growing demand for low-emission aviation solutions.

The EU mandates that SAF must make up at least 2% of jet fuel usage at airports in 2025, increasing to 6% by 2030, 20% by 2035, and reaching 70% by 2050. This regulation reflects the urgent need for cleaner fuel sources in aviation, an industry under increasing pressure to meet stringent emissions targets.

Gediminas Ziemelis, Chairman of Avia Solutions Group, stressed the strategic importance of the project: “The current global supply of sustainable aviation fuel is far from sufficient to meet the regulatory and commercial demand anticipated in the coming years. Our new facility in Liepāja will be vital in securing supply chains for the future of green aviation.”

The plant will utilise PureSAF technology, developed by Swedish Biofuels and licensed exclusively to US engineering company KBR.

This technology has demonstrated greenhouse gas emissions reductions of up to 93% compared to fossil-based jet fuel. Importantly, it also allows for the production of eSAF, a synthetic version of SAF made using renewable electricity, green hydrogen, and captured carbon dioxide.

By 2030, EU regulations will require 1.2% of all SAF supplied to be synthetic, a share that will increase to 50% by 2050. The NorSAF plant’s integrated production model will meet both bio-based and synthetic SAF targets by combining bioethanol, green hydrogen generated via electrolysis and captured CO₂.

Vytautas Cekanavičius, CEO of Baltic Ground Services and NorSAF board member, noted: “We are developing a full green energy cycle – powering electrolysis with renewable electricity to generate hydrogen, then combining it with bioethanol and recycled CO₂ to produce SAF and eSAF. This makes our approach both sustainable and scalable.”

The site was selected for its strategic advantages, including existing infrastructure such as gas pipelines, railway access, ethanol handling facilities and plans for a nearby green hydrogen plant. Discussions are ongoing with potential suppliers of CO₂ to support the synthetic fuel production process.

A feasibility study conducted by KBR is due to be completed in late 2025, with construction expected to commence by 2027. According to Jānis Kisiels, board member at NorSAF, project timelines are on track:

“We are working closely with investors, suppliers and EU institutions to begin construction within two years. This facility positions Latvia at the forefront of the SAF industry while contributing to energy independence and green growth.”

Currently, the Baltic States consume approximately 400,000 tonnes of aviation fuel annually. Under the EU’s current 2% SAF mandate, the regional demand stands at just 8,000 tonnes. With its planned capacity, the Liepāja plant will not only meet local needs but also provide surplus SAF for export, making it a critical hub in Europe’s green aviation network.",https://tankterminals.com/wp-content/themes/tankterminals/src/img/favicon/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-07-23 06:57:49.151731

Europe stands at a critical juncture in its journey toward a net zero aviation future. A recent unified appeal from stakeholders across the aviation and fuel industries signals both an opportunity and a challenge. The call is simple but urgent: policy makers must strengthen and accelerate support for the deployment of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, to meet the region’s climate ambitions.

While SAF remains a key lever for reducing the carbon footprint of air transport, its market development is still in its infancy. The only commercially viable option today—HEFA-based fuels—continues to face stiff cost competition from conventional kerosene. Meanwhile, next-generation options such as e-SAF and advanced biofuels are struggling to move from concept to investment reality.

Why the Industry Is Coming Together Now

Aviation associations, fuel suppliers, airports, and cargo operators have coalesced to issue a ten-point policy action plan aimed at catalysing the SAF market. Their message is clear: while the regulatory architecture exists in the form of the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, it is insufficient by itself. Legal mandates provide the structure, but financial and market support mechanisms are needed to provide the necessary scale and cost-efficiency.

The upcoming Sustainable Transport Investment Plan from the European Commission, due this autumn, is seen as a crucial moment to integrate these support mechanisms and align institutional strategy with commercial and environmental urgency.

The Cost Conundrum and Investment Gap

Even as the aviation sector commits to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, SAF developers face significant hurdles in securing long-term financing. In particular, the high upfront risk and capital requirements of SAF production technologies such as e-SAF make final investment decisions elusive.

The challenge is two-fold:

Bridging the cost gap between SAF and fossil-based kerosene.

Unlocking investment in infrastructure and technology at a pace fast enough to meet regulatory milestones.

Without market certainty and reliable demand signals, developers of innovative fuel technologies are unlikely to make the leap from pilot to plant.

Ten Actions for a Stronger SAF Ecosystem

The action plan presented to EU officials outlines a mix of regulatory, financial, and market-based measures to correct early-mover disadvantages and catalyse broader SAF uptake. Highlights include:

Extending SAF eligibility under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme in both volume and duration.

Launching dedicated funding calls for SAF innovation under existing EU instruments, including the Innovation Fund and the European Investment Bank.

Introducing a revenue certainty tool to mitigate offtake risks and encourage production commitments.

Developing a virtual ticketing mechanism to support SAF attribute trading, enhancing market liquidity and price transparency.

Reducing administrative burdens for smaller SAF producers and startups to help level the playing field.

These actions aim not just to address existing challenges, but to engineer a self-sustaining SAF value chain that balances investment risk with environmental reward.

Ensuring Equity and Regional Balance

A particularly compelling dimension of the industry’s call is the emphasis on equitable SAF access across European regions. As Montserrat Barriga of the European Regions Airline Association noted, uneven SAF distribution may skew public perception and exacerbate reputational disparities between operators.

Policy measures, therefore, must consider not only scale and cost but also inclusiveness—ensuring that regional carriers and less-developed airports are not left behind in the transition.

From Regulation to Strategy

The sentiment from industry is that SAF deployment cannot be addressed in isolation. It must be integrated into a holistic aviation strategy that spans aircraft innovation, air traffic management modernisation, and carbon removals. By broadening the lens, Europe can move from fragmented support to cohesive leadership in sustainable aviation.

The call for action represents more than an industry wish list—it is a roadmap for systemic change.

Conclusion: Why This Moment Matters

The aviation sector is not merely asking for policy favours. It is offering a vision where regulation, finance, and innovation align to create a high-growth, low-carbon fuel economy. This vision rests on the understanding that climate goals must be achieved in tandem with economic resilience and connectivity across Europe.

For stakeholders committed to sustainable mobility, this is the moment to watch. The coming months will likely determine whether Europe leads the SAF transition or lags behind global competitors.

As the conversation unfolds, it is important for all sectors—from technology to transport—to stay engaged and proactive. Cross-industry collaboration will be essential to turn policy frameworks into scalable solutions that redefine the future of flight.

Reps. Mike Flood, R-Neb., and Troy A. Carter, Sr., D-La., on July 21 reintroduced the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Information Act. The bill directs the U.S. Energy Information Administration to more explicitly include SAF data in its weekly and monthly reports, in line with existing standards and consistent with other fuel types.

Flood and Carter introduced a previous version of the bill in August 2024. The current bill, H.R 4562, was referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce following its introduction.

The SAF Information Act directs the EIA to include data on SAF in its Petroleum Supply Month report and its Weekly Petroleum Status Report, including data related to the type, origin and volume of feedstock used in the production of SAF, along with the total amount of SAF produced domestically and imported.

“Nebraska remains a national leader in biofuel production and is a driving global leader in advancing the bioeconomy,” Flood said. “SAF represents just one of many promising ways to grow the biofuels sector and boost our rural communities. Our straightforward, commonsense bill requires the EIA to include SAF in its published data, giving industry leaders and stakeholders better insight into production trends. I’m grateful to my colleague for partnering with me once again to support the growth of the SAF industry.”

“Without coordinated action between government and industry, greenhouse gas emissions will continue to increase as more people and goods fly through our skies,” Carter added. “Sustainable aviation fuel is an exciting, new green fuel that’s creating jobs in Louisiana. I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation to ensure America is on track to meet the growing demand for cleaner transportation and healthier communities.”

Supporters of the SAF Information Act include the Advanced Biofuels Association, American Farm Bureau Federation, American Soybean Association, American Sugar Cane League, Greater New Orleans Inc., Growth Energy, Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation, National Corn Growers Association, National Oilseed Producers Association, Nebraska Corn Growers Association, Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation, Nebraska Soybean Association, Renewable Fuels Association, Renewable Fuels Nebraska, and the SAF Coalition.

“As we work to speed up the development and deployment of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), real-time production and supply updates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration will offer crucial insights,” said Alison Graab, executive director for the SAF Coalition. These updates will play a key role in effectively scaling up SAF across the country.”

“Transparent and timely market data are critically important to help the nascent SAF industry get off the ground, said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the RFA. “This legislation would ensure SAF producers and users have the information they need to make informed decisions and smart investments. The Renewable Fuels Association thanks Reps. Flood and Carter for their leadership on this issue and we strongly support their legislation,”

""America's farmers and biofuel producers will only be able to lead in global markets for clean fuels if we have reliable data to help guide investment decisions and measure our progress,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “Rep. Flood's bill is common sense and will lay the groundwork for new jobs and new investments, while giving the U.S. a way to track its path toward becoming the world leader in SAF production.”

“The Advanced Biofuels Association is proud to endorse the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Information Act and to play an important part in our nation’s energy dominance agenda,” said Michael McAdams, President of the Advanced Biofuels Association. “Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), also known as synthetic aviation fuel, is an in-demand U.S. energy export that is the latest in a long tradition of American renewable fuel innovations. This legislation will improve data streams from the U.S. Energy Information Administration that help our domestic farmers and biorefiners make informed decisions to increase SAF production levels.”

The proposed SAF-BAM system, it said, should be established through EU legislation and enforced by national authorities.","Deloitte has warned that the European Union’s current sustainable aviation fuel policies could unintentionally weaken the competitiveness of European airlines and slow progress toward decarbonisation.

A new study by Deloitte for airlines for Europe, published recently on Green Air News, raised concerns that the ReFuelEU mandate, which requires increasing the use of sustainable aviation fuel, may drive passengers toward non-EU carriers and destinations that are not bound by the same environmental regulations.

The report warned that this could result in carbon and business leakage, undermining both climate goals and market fairness.

Deloitte estimated that ReFuelEU could increase cost disparities by up to 15 per cent on key EU–Asia routes by 2030.

As a solution, the study proposes a SAF Book and Claim Accounting Mechanism, which it said could help maintain a level playing field without raising overall prices for consumers.

The report identified the main types of leakage caused by the current policy framework including passengers choosing non-EU hubs like Istanbul or Dubai over EU hubs such as Paris or Frankfurt to avoid SAF costs; travelers opting for indirect routes outside the EU, since ReFuelEU applies only to the first flight segment departing from the EU; and EU travelers selecting non-EU holiday spots to avoid EU ETS costs, and non-EU residents bypassing EU destinations altogether.

While the EU already has a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism to price the carbon content of imports like cement and steel from countries with weaker climate rules, discussions are underway to possibly extend CBAM to aviation.

However, a 2024 analysis by Ishka notes this is complicated by the upcoming 2026 review of ICAO’s CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), which will assess whether the scheme aligns with the Paris Agreement targets.

The Deloitte report argued that applying CBAM to aviation is “neither legally nor practically feasible,” and called for a tailored solution for international air travel emissions.

The proposed SAF-BAM system, it said, should be established through EU legislation and enforced by national authorities.

It was added that the mechanism would rely on integrating passenger data with flight operations data to calculate SAF use per passenger and per flight segment.

“Revenue generated from the sale of SAF-BAM certificates could be dedicated to further support the aviation sector, including green transition projects,” the report added.",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/15001652/European-Union-.jpg,N,,2025-07-23 01:18:32.319956

These regulations set ambitious targets to be fulfilled by aviation fuel suppliers; but given the expected high cost of SAF and the immature state of the industry, it is far from certain that sufficient fuel production capacity will be developed in time to hit near-term targets. It is anyway likely that there will be political pressure to reduce long-term targets.

Complementary policies have been developed to provide financial support to SAF on a ‘per litre’ basis, with the aim of facilitating uptake and/or production. The EU’s reimbursement scheme mitigates the cost to airlines for each unit of alternative fuel they consume by reimbursing some fraction of the cost difference compared to fossil kerosene. The UK’s guaranteed strike price (GSP), on the other hand, offers a Government-backed mechanism to shield SAF producers from variability in market prices, thereby establishing certainty over revenues and de-risking investment. The GSP seeks to provide reassurance to investors in early-stage commercial projects, facilitating finance availability in a way that is hoped to be effective in jump-starting production and reducing the cost of capital.

This report examines the SAF policy frameworks in the two regions and reviews their strengths and weaknesses. It finds that while the EU’s and the UK’s frameworks are currently the strongest incentives for SAF deployment in the world, both face challenges and the structure and targeting of their complementary support mechanisms will deliver diverging outcomes. We anticipate that the EU’s reimbursement scheme will primarily benefit airlines and reduce the costs to flyers, it will do little to provide a durable price signal to motivate more challenging second-generation fuel producers to enter the market; in contrast the UK’s GSP delivers clear and stable price certainty to fuel producers and is more likely to stimulate investment in the SAF industry.",https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_1465494506-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-23 01:18:36.111357

17 UK companies developing sustainable aviation fuel to receive share of new £63 million funding boost, supporting around 1,400 jobs

latest investment builds on this year’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) drive, which will help position the UK as the world leader in homegrown sustainable aviation fuel production

latest investment supports greenlighting of multiple airport expansion schemes to kickstart economic growth and deliver on our Plan for Change

Passengers are a step closer to greener flights as the Aviation Minister today (22 July 2025) announced the 17 cutting-edge UK companies that will share £63 million to accelerate sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

The boost will support around 1,400 jobs and secure Britain’s position as the global leader in the green aviation market – critical to provide the clean fuel that’s essential to realise sustainable growth in the aviation sector.

Today’s investment means government has provided £198 million to date through the Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF) to scale up cleaner aviation technologies. Creating a clean aviation ecosystem will help power the next generation of airport infrastructure and capacity scale up, kickstarting economic growth and delivering the UK’s clean energy superpower ambitions to deliver on the Plan for Change.

Low carbon fuel production could add up to £5 billion to the economy by 2050, position the UK as a global hub for SAF production and enable the UK to go further and faster with expansion plans.

Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, said:

This £63 million is lift off for Britain’s green aviation revolution.

We’re not just backing brilliant British innovation, we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market.

From the labs of Sheffield to the runways of the future – this is how we kickstart economic growth, secure energy independence and make Britain a clean energy superpower.

SAF is an alternative to fossil jet fuel which reduces greenhouse gas emissions on average by 70% on a lifecycle basis, from feedstock to biofuel, making it the key technology that will allow UK aviation to grow capacity while achieving net zero commitments.

The SAF Bill will help secure the future of the aviation sector by boosting green fuel production in the UK and delivering cleaner flights. This bill will give investors the confidence to back sustainable aviation fuel production. It will help grow the sector, providing good green jobs and enabling the delivery of carbon savings.

Announcing the new funding at the University of Sheffield’s Energy Innovation Centre – which just received £1.5 million in this latest round – the Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, saw firsthand the groundbreaking work on aircraft engine testbeds and revolutionary aviation fuels.

Professor Mohamed Pourkashanian, Managing Director of the University of Sheffield’s Energy Innovation Centre, who is leading the project, said:

It is fantastic to see the University of Sheffield playing a leading role in the development of sustainable aviation fuel and supporting the aviation industry in its efforts to reduce its emissions.

At Sheffield, we have some of the most advanced SAF research facilities in Europe and are excited to work with partners from the industry to help them test and develop new fuels and next generation clean energy technologies.

The AFF winners include a range of companies and are spread across the country, such as OXCCU Tech, which is developing a demonstration plant at Oxford Airport, to LanzaJet, which is building a commercial-scale plant in Teesside.

Andrew Symes, CEO and Co-Founder of OXCCU, said:

Support from the Advanced Fuels Fund is a key step in scaling our technology.

This funding enables the detailed design and construction of OX2, our demonstration plant launching in 2026, and builds on the successful delivery of OX1. It brings us closer to producing lower-cost, lower-carbon aviation fuel and supports the UK’s ambition to become a global leader in SAF production.

Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet, said:

We’re proud that Project Speedbird, developed in partnership with British Airways, has been recognised by the Department for Transport as part of its continued commitment to advancing SAF in the UK.

This support demonstrates confidence in LanzaJet’s technology and the critical role ethanol-to-SAF can play in delivering economic growth, creating jobs and decarbonising air travel. Project Speedbird is vital to building a national SAF industry in the UK and to unlocking opportunity and innovation in the region.

We thank DfT for its leadership and vision in accelerating the transition to net-zero aviation.

However, rigid carbon intensity (CI) accounting procedures in current policies may limit CI responsiveness across candidate sites and facilities. This work examines a hypothetical biomass-to-sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) process to demonstrate how GHG accounting requirements drive estimates of biofuel CI and to explore potential CI and financial implications of scenario-specific life cycle assessment (LCA).

The CI of hypothetical SAF produced from miscanthus via the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) pathway was calculated according to specifications from three low carbon fuel policies (U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), Canada Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR), and California Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS)) and the 45Z tax credit. These were compared against modeling results tailored to specific feedstock-to-fuel scenarios (scenario-specific LCA) defined by feedstock and facility siting and feedstock split ratio (the proportion of miscanthus allocated to fuel production vs. electricity).

GHG accounting using the CFR/LCFS can reasonably account for distinct levels of net electricity production by a biorefinery, but only the CFR yields similar CI sensitivity to spatially explicit factors as scenario-specific LCA. Most GHG accounting frameworks do not capture CI variation across candidate sites in the United States.

This work demonstrates the importance of LCA methodological specifications in low carbon fuel policies and tax credits and illustrates that policies that enable scenario-specific CI calculations could enhance crediting accuracy and more effectively support implementation of low-emission practices.

“It’s not if, it’s when fossil fuels run out,” Smith said.

Once the products hit the shelves, customers will see QIRA branding to identify it in stores.","EDDYVILLE – Iowa-grown corn will soon end up in the fibers of Spanx apparel and other products typically made with petroleum-based components, manufactured at a new facility at the Cargill plant in Eddyville.

Qore, the joint venture between Minnesota-based Cargill and Germany-based HELM AG, celebrated the opening of the $300 million facility Tuesday, and future growth it represents.

The facility will take sustainably grown corn from within the area, then grind it and process it into QIRA, which the company said is an “identical replacement” of 1,4-butanediol, a chemical component used to manufacture various polymers.

Officials with Qore and the partnering companies said the venture is a response to consumer demand for more sustainably produced products, but will also stoke the Iowa corn market and local economy, and pave the way for future partnerships to for bio-based alternatives to petroleum-derived products.

Jon Veldhouse, CEO of Qore, said Tuesday the project “connects” a “global challenge” with the natural process of corn absorbing CO2 and turning light into plant energy.

“It proves that scalable solutions can come from the ground up, that innovation can start with corn, that the products we use every day in fashion, footwear, personal care, electronics, automotive — they can be more responsible and serve a louder purpose,” Veldhouse said.

Extending the life of petroleum via bio-based solutions

Qore has already partnered with a number of brands, the first of which was Lycra, the original makers of Spandex materials.

Gary Smith, Lycra Company’s CEO, said with QIRA, he can provide a high level of product credibility and show consumers exactly where the corn in their yoga pants was grown.

But, he said the Qore partnership represents more than just a “sustainable story” he can communicate to consumers.

“It’s about a future where you don’t have to compromise on the standard of living that we’ve all come to know,” Smith said. “The ability to actually have renewable inputs that replace petrochemicals is huge.”

Smith said he hopes this is “the first step” in a future with many QIRA facilities around the world.

“It’s not if, it’s when fossil fuels run out,” Smith said. “We’ve done wonderful things of extending — fracking, horizontal drilling, shale oil, whatever — but there’s only so many dead dinosaurs in the ground.”

At full capacity, the Eddyville plant will have an annual demand of 100 million bushels of corn.

Steve Kuiper, an Iowa corn farmer growing for the facility, said that capacity would take all of his corn “plus a whole lot of other folks.’”

Plus, that corn would be sold at a premium since QIRA needs to be made with corn grown under regenerative farming practices, like cover cropping and reduced tillage.

Kuiper said he was already following these practices, but now that he has a designated market for his corn, it has made him “more mindful” of the practices.

Corn farmers have had low market prices the past several years and are looking for new markets that will give them a higher price per bushel, or to grow the market through things like Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

Kuiper said the QIRA market doesn’t fill the same gap as something like sustainable aviation fuel would, but he said “biochemistry is on everybody’s minds” and he said farmers, and consumers, need to advocate for more biochemical solutions.

“Those are direct replacements for petroleum products,” Kuiper said. “It’s going to do a couple of things – it’s better for the environment, but it’s also going to extend the life of petroleum.”

Axel Viering, an executive board member of the German chemical company HELM, said the partnership with Cargill and HELM represents a meeting of agriculture and chemicals.

“The vision of Qore is to produce and market something very special,” Viering said. “QIRA is the purest, the finest, the most sustainable product in its product category, and the goal is to position Qore as a lighthouse asset, globally, for sustainable solutions.”

Economic development

The plant in Eddyville is poised to produce 66,000 metric tons of QIRA annually, but the partners said they all hope demand for the product expands and more facilities will be needed.

Rep. Hans Wilz, R-Ottumwa, attended the ribbon cutting ceremony Tuesday and said he has driven past the Cargill plant, which opened 40 years ago in Eddyville, countless times and had friends who worked there. He said the Qore expansion is a reminder that the plant has a “much bigger footprint than most people understand.”

“It’s farmers growing corn, it’s people having jobs, but it’s also sustainability and a cleaner way to do things — even in our clothing now,” Wilz said. “…it’s cool to see how we fit in the process.”

Colleen May, president at Cargill’s Bioindustrial Group, said it’s difficult to calculate the economic impact of the plant because there are many connected supply chains.

During the Trump administration, there has been a shift away from sustainable projects, like Climate Smart agriculture and other project started by the Biden administration, in favor of promoting increased domestic production of fossil fuels.

May said in her conversations about Qore at the federal level, this change in mindset hasn’t been an issue. She said most Congress members agree on projects that support rural America.

“We’re emphasizing today more about economic development, particularly in the Midwest and that has been very very well received,” May said.

She said biosolutions represent an alternative for “conscious consumers” but there is “not enough agriculture to completely replace” petrochemicals, so the two will continue to coexist.

May said now that the plant is up and running they have been able to send samples to “dozens and dozens” of customers who are interested in using QIRA and she expects more brands will use the material.

Once the products hit the shelves, customers will see QIRA branding to identify it in stores.

“It’s like the Intel inside,” May said. “That’s how we think of it.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/eddyville-qore-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-07-22 16:56:07.965674

Under an arrangement announced in late May, PIT has contracted Avina Synthetic Aviation Fuel (Avina) to build a state-of-the-art SAF production facility just south of its terminal.
The SAF hub will also “meet local and regional commercial and cargo needs at PIT and beyond,” said the airport.
“Here, bioethanol derived from sugarcane grown onsite will be converted to 100% SAF utilizing the ethanol-to-jet pathway,” KBR said.

Now, PIT is poised to be among the first airports in the world to provide sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to commercial and cargo operators by producing it onsite at the airport.

Under an arrangement announced in late May, PIT has contracted Avina Synthetic Aviation Fuel (Avina) to build a state-of-the-art SAF production facility just south of its terminal.

Using a range of renewable feedstocks, the facility will produce ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials)-certified SAF by deploying an alcohol-to-jet technology known as PureSAF, which was developed by Swedish Biofuels AB and is exclusively licensed by KBR, a global provider of science, technology, and engineering solutions.

“The U.S. Air Force is already flying with it,” PIT chief executive officer Christina Cassotis said of the fully fungible military grade jet fuel produced by the innovative PureSAF process and validated by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

“We believe that it’s possible to not even have to blend that, that it could be 100% drop in so we’re looking forward to getting that plant built and operational because we know that SAF is the easiest thing to start with,” Cassotis said during the Future Travel Experience (FTE) World Innovation Summit at Carnegie Mellon University, two weeks before Avina was announced as PIT’s partner on the project.

Indeed, the SAF produced via the PureSAF process has “the same or, in some cases, better physical-chemical properties” as fossil jet fuel, according to KBR. Avina said the plant at PIT will have a carbon intensity that is “at least 65% lower than that of conventional jet fuel.”

Because of PureSAF’s feed flexibility — it can use renewable alcohol, synthesis gas (syngas), or carbon dioxide — the resulting SAF is billed by KBR as being more cost competitive than alternative offerings which require separate technologies for conversion of ethanol and gases.

Sitting on 8,800 acres, of which 25-30% has yet to be developed, PIT certainly has the land to accommodate the new SAF production facility, which will be spread across 50 acres. “And we have pipeline access to the [Ohio] River, which means whatever we produce can be barged to other markets,” Cassotis noted.

Moreover, she said of the Pittsburgh region, “we sit in the middle of millions of acres of bio-based feedstock.” This ensures that SAF can be produced at “a much more cost competitive price point, which we hope will be interesting in the industry.”

With plans to produce over 100 million gallons of SAF annually, through multiple phases of development, the facility could open as soon as 2028, enabling PIT’s airline partners to secure SAF readily and cost-effectively, whilst meeting their decarbonization targets. The SAF hub will also “meet local and regional commercial and cargo needs at PIT and beyond,” said the airport.

Elsewhere KBR’s PureSAF technology platform has been selected by Renewable Developments Australia (RDA), in collaboration with Virgin Australia and Qatar Airways to establish a SAF production facility in the Charters Towers Region of North Queensland, Australia. “Here, bioethanol derived from sugarcane grown onsite will be converted to 100% SAF utilizing the ethanol-to-jet pathway,” KBR said.

Meanwhile, PIT’s work to economically viable SAF has only just begun. During the FTE summit, Cassotis revealed that the airport is also investigating a SAF pathway using sludge, the output of sewage treatment plants, to convert into fuel cost-effectively. “One of the biggest things that we see is the cost of producing this green fuel. So, we are looking at that; we have looked at distributed hydrogen projects,” she noted. And under the last administration, PIT explored a pathway to coal mine methane being converted into SAF.

Avina explains the PureSAF process in the following video.

From preheating and cooling to waste heat recovery, systems like shell and tube heat exchangers and economizers play a critical role in aviation fuel processing.

Let’s break down how this equipment helps refine aviation fuel—and why it matters for engineers and operators alike.

How Thermal Process Equipment Powers Aviation Fuel Processing

In aviation fuel refining—often part of larger distillation or hydroprocessing systems—precise heat control is everything. That’s where thermal process equipment comes in. These systems handle heating, cooling, and energy recovery at nearly every stage of the process, making them indispensable for efficiency, safety, and product quality.

Key Equipment and What It Does:

Shell and Tube Heat Exchangers: Foundational to efficient heat management in fuel processing, these exchangers allow one fluid to flow through internal tubes while another circulates around them within the shell—facilitating reliable heat transfer. They’re used throughout the process for preheating fuel, condensing vapors, and cooling product before storage or blending.

Preheaters: By warming up aviation fuel before it enters distillation towers or hydrotreaters, preheaters reduce viscosity, improve flow, and ease the load on primary heating systems.

Condensers: Volatile hydrocarbons in fuel can vaporize during refining. Condensers convert these vapors back into liquid using coolants—capturing valuable components, enhancing safety, and avoiding environmental concerns from vapor discharge.

Coolers: Once processing is complete, hot fluids need to be cooled to safe temperatures. Shell and tube exchangers function as coolers here, using chilled water or glycol to prep fuel for storage or downstream steps.

Economizers: These units recover waste heat—often from flue gas or other hot process streams—and use it to preheat incoming fluids, saving energy and cutting fuel costs.

Supporting Sustainability with Aviation Biofuels

As aviation shifts toward more sustainable operations, bio-based fuels—such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)—are becoming a critical part of the fuel mix. While these fuels can be processed in existing infrastructure, they come with different thermal and chemical characteristics.

Thermal process equipment design and selection play a key role in:

Adapting to Feedstock Variability: Biofuels may be derived from biomass, animal fats, or even used cooking oil, all of which require fine-tuned temperature control during processing.

Meeting Regulatory Targets: Shell and tube heat exchangers and economizers help reduce emissions and energy use—supporting compliance with carbon reduction goals from organizations like the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

Maximizing Yield and Quality: Proper heat management ensures that SAF meets strict performance standards for commercial aviation. Downtime is avoided through the design of equipment that is robust, easy to quickly maintain, and simple to monitor for performance.

Whether refining traditional jet fuel or advanced biofuels, the same principles apply: efficient heat transfer and energy recovery are essential for both economic and environmental performance.

Operational Best Practices for Thermal Equipment

When it comes to aviation fuel processing, small choices in equipment, maintenance, and monitoring can have a big impact on efficiency, safety, and reliability. Here’s how to stay ahead:

Select the Right Equipment: Materials, flow rates, temperature range, and pressure ratings all matter. Stainless steel exchangers, for example, are a good fit for aviation fuel due to their corrosion resistance.

Maintain It Regularly: Cleaning fouled tubes and inspecting for leaks or corrosion keeps heat exchangers running efficiently.

Monitor the Process: Temperature and flow sensors can help detect issues early and allow for real-time adjustments.

Train Your Team: Equipment is only as good as the people running it. Keep teams informed on best practices for performance and safety.

Fueling the Future of Aviation

Aviation fuel processing is high-stakes and high-precision—and the right thermal process equipment makes all the difference. Whether you’re engineering the system or purchasing components, shell and tube heat exchangers and economizers play vital roles in refining reliable, high-quality fuel.

And as the industry moves toward more sustainable aviation biofuels, thermal process equipment isn’t just helpful—it’s essential. It’s not just about heat—it’s about performance, reliability, and staying ahead of the curve in an industry that never stands still.

The UK Department for Transport has confirmed 17 SAF production companies that will benefit from multi-million pound investment.

UK aviation minister Mike Kane has confirmed a £63 million investment in 17 innovative companies to advance the production of domestic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

The investment is part of the UK government’s Advanced Fuel Funds (AFF) competition, which was initiated in July 2022, to scale up cleaner aviation technologies. The government has so far provided £198 million through the fund, with the latest announcement marking the third window of funding.

AFF competition winners

The winning companies include Oxford-based start-up, OXCCU Tech, which was awarded £3.1 million towards developing a demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport. Meanwhile, LanzaJet, which is building a commercial-scale plant in South Wales was awarded £10 million and LanzaTech was awarded £6.4 million for its commercial scale SAF plants.

Other winners include Alfanar Energy, Altalto, British Sugar, Carbon Neutral Fuels, Equilibrion, Equinor Low Carbon UK, Essar Oil/ EET Fuels, ETFuels UK, LanzaTech, NorthPointe Energy, Power2X Solutions, SuMo Engineering, University of Sheffield – which boasts some of the most advanced SAF research facilities in Europe, Willis Sustainable Fuels and Zero Petroleum.

Why investment is key to scaling SAF technologies

According to Andrew Symes, CEO and co-founder of OXCCU, the investment is a key step in scaling its technology. “This funding enables the detailed design and construction of OX2, our demonstration plant launching in 2026, and builds on the successful delivery of OX1.”

Founded in 2021, the cleantech startup is developing highly efficient and inexpensive iron-based catalysts for direct conversion of recycled carbon dioxide and green hydrogen into jet fuels and plastics.

Traditional biofuels face challenges when it comes to scaling production, including limited feedstocks and the need for hydrocarbons to be created without the use of fossil fuels. While e-fuels or synthetic fuels based on CO2 have huge potential to scale with fewer feedstock constraints, they do face constraints due to costs. By consolidating the traditional e-hydrocarbons production process from two steps down to a one-step direct hydrogenation process, OXCCU offers a cost-effective solution.

Meanwhile, Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet expressed his delight that Project Speedbird, developed in partnership with British Airways, has also been recognised by the Department for Transport. The UK’s first ethanol-to-SAF facility, Project Speedbird uses LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet technology to convert second-generation ethanol, produced from sources including agricultural residues and woody biomass, into SAF.

“This support demonstrates confidence in LanzaJet’s technology and the critical role ethanol-to-SAF can play in delivering economic growth, creating jobs and decarbonising air travel. Project Speedbird is vital to building a national SAF industry in the UK and to unlocking opportunity and innovation in the region.”

Boosting the UK as a global hub for SAF production

Kane underlined that low carbon fuel production could add £5 billion to the economy by 2050 and position the UK as a global hub for SAF production. He also noted that creating a clean aviation ecosystem will help kickstart the next generation of airport infrastructure and capacity.

“We’re not just backing British innovation, we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market,” he said.

“From the labs of Sheffield to the runways of the future – this is how we kickstart economic growth, secure energy independence, and make Britain a clean energy superpower.”

Accelerating the availability and affordability of SAF

Earlier this month European aviation stakeholders including airports, airlines and regulators, highlighted that need to accelerate the availability and affordability of SAF. With aviation critical to providing vital connectivity and supporting socio-economic growth, SAF is widely accepted as being critical to achieving the industry’s net zero target.

However, transitioning to a net zero industry requires substantial investment to develop and deploy SAF at scale, upgrade infrastructure and support technological innovations within the industry. EU demand for SAF requires the construction of around 12 new industrial-scale first-of-a-kind e-SAF plants by 2050.

The UK’s AFF third funding window comes at a crucial time as industry stakeholders call for decisive policy action to support a timely and robust ramp-up of SAF across Europe. Key priorities include accelerating the development of new SAF projects and plants, increasing feedstock availability, and introducing a revenue certainty instrument to address the offtake mismatch between long-term production commitments and short-term demand.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-22-at-18.32.05.png,N,,2025-07-22 14:56:25.096640

(irliepaja.lv (Google translation)) The world's largest full-service aircraft leasing provider, Avia Solutions Group, together with its Latvian partners in the joint venture NorSAF, have launched an ambitious project - the largest sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant in Northern Europe will be built in the Liepāja Special Economic Zone. The produced fuel will be supplied to aviation companies in Northern Europe and exported to other markets around the world, informs Avia Solutions Group.

Production with a capacity of approximately 100,000 tons of SAF per year is planned to begin in 2030, making the NorSAF plant the largest SAF production facility in Northern Europe. Its costs are estimated at 500-600 million euros, depending on the chosen technological solution. As this project will compete on a global scale, its successful implementation depends on the assistance and support it will receive from the European Union, institutional investors and government authorities.

Often referred to as the future of aviation, SAF produces significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions than conventional jet fuel. From the beginning of this year, the European Union has introduced a requirement that at least 2% of all fuel consumed at airports must be SAF. This requirement will gradually increase, reaching 6% by 2030, 20% by 2035 and 70% by 2050. Gediminas Ziemelis, founder and chairman of the board of Avia Solutions Group, points out that the further development of the aviation industry will be directly related to new sustainability standards.

...

This ambitious project is the group's first step in the field of aviation fuel production. The group's subsidiary ""Baltic Ground Services"", which has extensive experience in the supply and distribution of SAF, has been selected to implement the technological part.

The new production facility will use PureSAF technology, developed by ""Swedish Biofuels AB"" and exclusively licensed by the US engineering firm ""KBR"". This technology has been proven to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 93% compared to conventional jet fuel.

...

""It should be noted that by 2030, another important condition will come into force: 1.2% of all SAF fuel supplied will have to be synthetic. This type of fuel is produced without using biological components. Instead, green energy is used to produce hydrogen, which is then mixed with carbon dioxide. This requirement will also gradually increase, and by 2050, half of all SAF fuel will have to be synthetic. So, changes in the aviation industry are already happening at full speed,"" says Vytautas Cekanavicius, CEO of Baltic Ground Services and member of the board of NorSAF.

Using PureSAF technology, NorSAF will be able to produce both SAF and eSAF (synthetic fuel derived from renewable energy) from bioethanol, hydrogen and captured CO2, with the full green energy cycle becoming the main feature of the project. Green electricity will power electrolysis to produce green hydrogen, which will then be combined with captured CO₂ and ethanol to create both SAF and eSAF. The use of the resulting CO2 in fuel production will be particularly beneficial for the environment.

KBR is conducting a feasibility study, which is planned to be completed by the second half of 2025. Work on the project is expected to begin soon after.

The grant will accelerate the development of LanzaTech’s DRAGON 1 & 2 projects, each playing a crucial role in the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the UK. Project DRAGON stands for Decarbonizing and Reimagining Aviation for the Goal Of Netzero.

The DRAGON 1 project is LanzaTech’s existing U.K. SAF project that will convert recycled carbon fuel ethanol (including ethanol from LanzaTech’s gas fermentation process) into Advanced SAF in Port Talbot, South Wales, using the LanzaJet Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) process.

The DRAGON 2 project is a Power-to-Liquid (PtL) facility that will convert waste carbon dioxide and green hydrogen into ethanol for subsequent conversion into PtL SAF at an adjacent facility using the LanzaJet Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) process. The location for DRAGON 2 in the UK will be determined during this grant-funded project.

Integrating LanzaTech’s gas fermentation process with LanzaJet’s AtJ technology gives this approach a distinctive edge. By turning regional waste resources into valuable SAF, LanzaTech facilitates the production of low Carbon Intensity (CI) fuels, contributing positively to the UK’s SAF Mandate and supporting economic growth and job creation in industrial zones in the UK.

“The future of aviation fuel is ethanol-to-SAF and LanzaTech is at the forefront,” said Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech. “Our commitment to enabling cleaner jet fuel is bolstered by the UK government’s continued support and confidence in LanzaTech as a leader in the sector. This funding not only affirms the value of our unique technology and feedstock approach but also propels our mission to integrate air travel into a circular carbon economy. DRAGON 1 & 2 are set to drive the global SAF market forward and exemplify the UK’s commitment to leading SAF innovation on the global stage.”

The UK government’s significant investment in these projects underscores their confidence in LanzaTech’s proven, commercial-scale technology and its potential to substantially boost the UK’s SAF production. This endorsement not only solidifies LanzaTech’s reputation as a leader in advancing global clean energy initiatives but also emphasizes the crucial role of feedstock providers. By leveraging low-cost, sustainable inputs for SAF production, LanzaTech is poised to play a key role in aiding the aviation sector’s pursuit of its net-zero commitments.

Separately, Project Speedbird by LanzaJet, in which LanzaTech holds a 36% ownership stake, also received recognition and £10 million in funding from the Advanced Fuels Fund, further testament to the government’s trust in the Lanza technology portfolio. In 2024, LanzaTech and LanzaJet partnered to create CirculAir™, that transforms nearly any form of waste carbon (including CO2, MSW, agri residues) into SAF, combining the groundbreaking technologies of both companies to provide the aviation industry with a solution to produce waste-based SAF on a global scale.

This allocation boosts total government contributions through the Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF) to £198 million, aimed at expanding cleaner aviation technologies. This strategic investment is a testament to the UK government’s comprehensive approach to environmental strategies, aligning with initiatives like the recently enacted SAF Mandate. This funding round notably supports a broad spectrum of pathways and feedstocks for SAF production—an inclusive move by the UK government that recognizes the need for varied solutions in the pursuit of net-zero aviation.",https://www.chemengonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ce-sm-logo-400x400-sb.jpg,N,,2025-07-22 18:56:18.063578

A “clerical error” led to one-way tickets — which usually sell for approximately $500 — being listed for $1,800 to $2,000 on Canadian North’s website Monday, said Lauren D’Oliveira, an airline spokesperson.
D’Oliveira said it might take some time for the website to update, but early Monday afternoon it still listed the wrong prices.
Canadian North was recently acquired by Exchange Income Corp. Its chief executive officer, Mike Pyle, promised the sale would not drive up the airline’s fares.
In 2023, the department announced conditions for Canadian North’s 2019 merger with First Air that included a 25 per cent cap on annual fare increases.","Alex McConnachie couldn’t believe his eyes: When he checked Canadian North’s website Monday morning, it said the price of a one-way ticket from Ottawa to Iqaluit had more than tripled to approximately $2,000.

“I’m a hostage to these fares,” said McConnachie, who lives in Iqaluit and shares custody of his 12-year-old son with his ex-wife, who lives in Halifax. Under their custody agreement, McConnachie has to pay for the plane ticket for his son to travel to visit his mother regardless of how much the ticket costs.

“So if they say that flight is $9,000, I have to pay it,” he said, adding that a drastic increase in Canadian North prices would mean that simply fulfilling his duties as a father might drive him deep into debt.

Turns out, it was all a false alarm.

A “clerical error” led to one-way tickets — which usually sell for approximately $500 — being listed for $1,800 to $2,000 on Canadian North’s website Monday, said Lauren D’Oliveira, an airline spokesperson.

D’Oliveira said it might take some time for the website to update, but early Monday afternoon it still listed the wrong prices.

“We can confirm a configuration error during a recent system update did affect fares that would have been visible on our website,” said Pam Plaster, vice-president for investor development for Exchange Income Corp., the airline’s owner.

She said fares are not being increased.

Plaster said Canadian North will contact passengers, such as McConnachie, who already booked flights at the incorrect prices to issue “appropriate refunds.”

D’Oliveira said she didn’t know the exact number of passengers who will receive a refund or when the incorrect prices first appeared on the website.

Canadian North was recently acquired by Exchange Income Corp. Its chief executive officer, Mike Pyle, promised the sale would not drive up the airline’s fares.

News that the price hike was an error came as relief to McConnachie.

He said the panic he and other Nunavummiut experienced reminded him of a long-running joke that the North’s dominant airline’s motto should be: “Canadian North — what are you gonna do, walk?”

“It’s not like we have other options,” McConnachie said.

Doubling the price of tickets would have contravened the orders of Transport Canada, the federal department responsible for national transportation policies and programs.

In 2023, the department announced conditions for Canadian North’s 2019 merger with First Air that included a 25 per cent cap on annual fare increases. The conditions remain in effect until June 30, 2026.",https://cdn.nunatsiaq.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Canadian-North-737-photo-credit-Mark-Taylor-1-1536x1026-1-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-07-22 13:07:04.597569

Vivergo outlines hopes for UK bioethanol plant rescue

London, 21 July (Argus) — UK bioethanol producer Vivergo is proceeding with plans to close its 416mn litres/yr Saltend plant in eastern England, but has outlined ways the government could prevent this. Vivergo has said deliveries of wheat will cease at the end of July, and redundancies will begin in August, ahead of closure in September . It already said it had stopped buying wheat in June . The decision to close was made by Vivergo's parent company, food and ingredients group Associated British Foods (ABF), after a US-UK trade deal agreed in May that allowed duty-free imports of up to 1.4bn l/yr of US ethanol. ABF confirmed at the end of June that it was in talks with the government, but no timeline has been put on the process. The first stage of the talks was for UK producers, like Vivergo and Ensus, operator of the 400mn l/yr Wilton bioethanol refinery in northeast England, to submit their strategic business cases. Ensus has said it could close Wilton. Covering costs Vivergo told Argus it wants the government to cover losses of £3mn/month, or £35mn/yr, which it said have been incurred as a result of government decisions. Previously, ABF proposed a support package of £75mn/yr , for up to two years, for the entire UK sector. In the longer-term, Vivergo said there is appetite from private investors to finance future projects. It pointed to a recent initial agreement to supply ethanol for a prospective alcohol-to-jet sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant planned by hydrogen developer Meld Energy at Saltend. Meld told Argus that while the project will be ""underpinned by government support mechanisms"", the ""longer term plan is to eventually eliminate reliance on subsidy through reducing cost of production which will likely be through scale, efficiency and technology advancement"". Meld chief executive Chris Smith also told Argus that sourcing bioethanol directly from Vivergo helped ""risk management"". He said locally-produced bioethanol brings ""greater certainty of supply"" and ""reduces local infrastructure requirements."" Vivergo said failure to support the bioethanol sector would be ""shortsighted"", because in order to meet projected increases in UK SAF demand by 2035 the country would need ""seven more Vivergos"", or a more than 3.5 times increase in domestic bioethanol production. Regulation frustration Vivergo said another key way for the government to help is to tackle the eligibility of unrefined liquid dextrose ultrafiltration retentate (Uldur) for double counting under the UK's renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO). Uldur, which is classfied in the UK as a waste ethanol feedstock, makes up a significant share of the total import pool from the US. Biofuels made from certain raw materials classed as ""wastes"" and ""residues"" under the RTFO receive double the amount of renewable transport fuel certificates (RTFCs) for every litre of fuel produced. RTFCs are tradeable credits primarily generated by the sale of biofuel-blended fuels and are used to help obligated parties meet the RTFO mandate. Vivergo says Uldur-derived ethanol is a co-product of the wet milling process rather than waste, and its eligibility for double counting is inconsistent with the RTFO's decarbonisation aims. It said producers using Uldur are able to make double-counting bioethanol using a more carbon-intensive production process than the fermentation of wheat, yet crop-based ethanol produced by Vivergo is ineligible for double counting. Vivergo said producers of double counting product get an additional certificate worth around £260/t, meaning it is unable compete with the low prices of Uldur-based bioethanol importers from the US. And these will now be able to enter the UK duty free under the new US-UK trade deal. The UK government is consulting on whether to continue classing Uldur as eligible for double counting. Other changes proposed by Vivergo include increasing the ethanol mandate in road fuel, from E10 to E15 or E20. Vivergo previously said an E15 mandate could boost demand in the UK by 660mn l/yr. It also highlighted the potential for increased bioethanol use in marine and aviation sectors. Capturing the moment Another key point in the talks with the government is the capture of CO2, a by-product of bioethanol production, Vivergo said. The company said it is 6-9 months away from having carbon capture facilities ready, at which point it would be capable of meeting around a third of the UK's 600,000 t/yr CO2 demand. Ensus captures 250,000 t/yr of CO2 at its 400mn l/yr bioethanol refinery in Wilton, northeast England. Vivergo said losing this would mean increased CO2 imports, and noted its output of high-protein animal feed as a co-product of wheat-to-ethanol production, which agricultural firms would otherwise have to import at a higher environmental cost. The National Farmers Union has previously said that losing the UK bioethanol industry would be a ""huge blow"", as it currently has the ""capacity to purchase around 2mn t of wheat each year"", so without it ""farmers would lose a reliable market for their feed wheat.""

The money will be shared by 17 UK-based companies, which are all involved in producing what the aviation industry calls sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The successful applicants for the funding include LanzaJet, which is building the Project Speedbird plant to convert ethanol into aviation fuel in Teesside in partnership with British Airways. Lanzajet is receiving £10 million from the government for this project, as well as another£6.4 million for two other production sites in the UK.

Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet, said: “This support demonstrates confidence in LanzaJet’s technology and the critical role ethanol-to-SAF can play in delivering economic growth, creating jobs and decarbonising air travel. Project Speedbird is vital to building a national SAF industry in the UK and to unlocking opportunity and innovation in the region.”

Other firms to receive funding include OXCCU Tech, which is developing a “demonstration” plant at Oxford Airport to convert green hydrogen into SAF, and Sheffield University for its research helping the aviation industry to test and develop new fuels and clean energy technologies.

The grants are the third “window” of funding through the government’s Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF), which has now provided a total of £198 million in investment towards the development of alternative aviation fuels.

UK aviation minister Mike Kane said: “We’re not just backing brilliant British innovation, we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market.”

Alternative aviation fuels can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70 per cent over the lifecycle of the fuel compared with traditional kerosene-based fuel.

The UK has introduced its SAF mandate this year, which requires at least 2 per cent of the overall aviation fuel mix from flights to be from sustainable sources in 2025. This percentage will increase to 10 per cent by 2030.

Neil Robinson, chief sustainability officer at Manchester Airports Group (MAG), said: “I am pleased to see £4.5 million of investment awarded to Essar and NorthPointe Energy, that will see airlines using Manchester Airport have direct access to SAF via the existing pipeline to the Stanlow production site.",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/BTNE/uploadedImages/1_News/Air_Travel/British%20Airways%20SAF%20delivery%20web.jpg?tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-07-22 13:07:34.914207

N2 - This study investigates the economic and technical viability of producing Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) using green hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) first, before assessing the process of methanol-to-jet in the second part. Using 66 kt/year of H2 and 480 kt/year of CO2 as feedstock, a production of 55 kt/year of kerosene is achieved. Based on a Discounted Cash Flow Rate Model, the economic analysis reveals a Levelized Cost of Operations (LCO) of $8.17 ± 5.25/kg, significantly higher than the European conventional jet fuel price ($0.46–1.77/kg). Consistent with other research, a sensitivity analysis confirms the substantial impact of H2 price on SAF costs, necessitating exploring new feedstocks. In this regard, bio-methanol emerges as promising with a mean LCO of $0.72/kg for economies of scales between 200 kt/year and 399 kt/year. Despite current limitations in bio-methanol production, the findings underscore the need for cost-effective solutions to provide sufficient supply of feedstock for SAF.

Policy momentum and market growth

Grazia Vascello, policy officer at the European Biogas Association (EBA), offered a comprehensive overview of the policy developments and market trajectory shaping Europe’s biogas and biomethane sectors. Representing more than 50 national associations and research bodies, the EBA plays a central role in promoting the interests of the bioenergy industry within EU institutions.

Vascello outlined four key policy priorities. First, the European Commission's strategic agenda continues to emphasise energy security and competitiveness, positioning biomethane as a core solution to reducing dependence on Russian gas.

Second, RePowerEU and the revised Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) are accelerating legislative support for renewable gases, mandating national plans to boost alternatives like biogas.

Third, the 2040 climate targets will shape emissions trajectories and influence future updates to EU energy legislation.

Lastly, she emphasised the importance of the EU Forest Strategy and emerging carbon capture pathways, where biogas can offer unique contributions.

Market growth is robust. In 2023, biomethane production approached 5 billion cubic metres – a remarkable 80% year-on-year increase – with leading contributions from France, Denmark and the UK.

The EU now hosts more than 1,300 operational plants, 85% of which are grid-connected. Newer facilities are increasingly using sustainable feedstocks such as agricultural residues and waste, rather than energy crops.

Investment momentum is also strong. In 2023, €2.7 billion was invested in the sector, with 150 additional plants expected to come online over the next five years. Countries like Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Poland are emerging as attractive markets for new development.

Biogas in the Arctic

Simon Ford, director of technical development at Rå Biopark, delivered an insightful presentation on the challenges and breakthroughs of building biogas infrastructure in Northern Norway – one of Europe’s most remote and logistically complex regions.

Drawing on his experience leading a multi-municipal initiative in Troms and Finnmark, Ford explained how strategic collaboration is transforming fragmented organic waste into a reliable, renewable energy source.

Historically, the region lacked both the scale and infrastructure to support viable biogas production. However, by coordinating public-sector waste operators across a territory larger than Belgium, Rå Biopark consolidated 15,000 tonnes of household organic waste, supplemented by input from breweries, agriculture, and Norway’s expanding aquaculture industry. The latter is shifting northward, creating new opportunities – and pressures – for sustainable waste management.

With no gas grid in place, the project is focusing on biomethane for transport. Thanks to high diesel prices and favourable tax treatment, renewable gas is an increasingly attractive alternative. The Norwegian government is co-financing three to four new fuelling stations to support heavy goods vehicle adoption.

Digestate management, a common challenge in remote areas, is being tackled through evaporation towers and wet pyrolysis, producing condensed, transportable outputs such as ammonia for industrial use. A new site – co-located with a waste incineration facility – will enable heat integration and improve logistical efficiency.

Ford underlined that this success would not have been possible without public-private cooperation, technical adaptability, and long-term commitment. What began as a scattered, low-volume waste system is now a scalable circular economy model for rural and Arctic regions – delivering climate benefits, local value and enhanced energy security in an area where few had imagined it could succeed.

Trading in Europe

Lucas Oliveira, from Engie’s Global Energy Management biomethane trading desk, gave a detailed account of the operational and regulatory complexity behind scaling up Europe’s biomethane trade.

Speaking on behalf of one of Europe’s largest gas trading companies, Oliveira stressed Engie’s ambition to reach 10 TWh of biomethane production by 2030, backed by €3 billion in investment.

With over 500 contracts with small producers in France alone, and trading activity spanning nine countries, Engie faces immense logistical and data management challenges in handling guarantees of origin (GOs), proof of sustainability (PoS) and gas molecules.

Oliveira underscored the fragmented nature of the European biomethane market. Registry systems, accepted feedstocks, certification schemes, units of measurement and data formats all vary from country to country. These discrepancies make cross-border trading technically difficult and administratively burdensome.

As a trader, Engie must reconcile the different requirements of voluntary and national sustainability schemes, convert units (such as heating values at varying temperatures) and match supply to diverse client demands – whether for waste-derived gas, RED II compliance, or specific PoS criteria.

To cope, Engie developed an internal digital tool named METAPoS. It tracks deliveries, automates data transposition between certification schemes (e.g. 2BSvs and ISCC), manages inventory and generates audit-ready mass balance reports.

Oliveira described how this tool helps ensure compliance, avoid double counting and unlock market value – particularly important given the increasing scale and complexity of their portfolio.

Looking ahead, Oliveira highlighted the need for harmonisation at EU level, not only to streamline administrative burden and reduce manual errors, but to open up cross-border market liquidity. He noted that pending legislation under the Union Database for gaseous fuels (UDB) may help standardise data flows. Until then, large players like Engie are building their own digital infrastructure to make sense of a highly heterogeneous market.

Nordic know-how

Ari Suomilammi, head of renewable gases at Gasum, offered an in-depth look into the challenges and opportunities of biomethane sourcing and trading in the Nordic region.

With extensive experience spanning nearly eight years in biomethane production and decades managing gas permissions, Suomilammi outlined Gasum’s integrated role in Finland, Sweden and Norway’s gas ecosystem.

As a state-owned company, Gasum delivers natural gas primarily in liquid form alongside biomethane and provides energy market services including power management. Its ecosystem encompasses biogas production support for agriculture, multiple import terminals for liquid biomethane, a network of about 20 biogas plants, and over 100 gas filling stations.

Suomilammi emphasised the rising demand for biomethane, particularly in the transport sector, driven by a combination of domestic production and imports from across Europe.

Gasum structures long-term sourcing contracts, often up to ten years, blending biomethane with grey gas in a “bio premium” model that balances sustainability with market realities. Emerging areas like biomethane from waste and bio-based CO2 are being explored, though volumes remain modest.

A key point was the complexity of operating within fragmented regulations and a lack of standardised markets. Biomethane premiums vary by country and registry, and unlike traditional commodities, biomethane trading faces challenges in pricing transparency, risk management and accounting.

Suomilammi identified major risks as market exposure through open positions, counterpart risk in long-term agreements, and regulatory uncertainty, which can abruptly impact sourcing and sales.

Gasum manages these risks through fixed-price sourcing contracts and hedging the grey gas component, while carefully controlling open positions based on company strength.

Logistics also present challenges, with delivery involving injection into gas grids, liquefaction and shipping where pipeline networks are limited. Suomilammi concluded that while the European biomethane market remains nascent and complex, demand growth, especially in transportation, underscores the need for regulatory harmonisation to unlock its full potential.

Certifying biomethane

Tim Hamers, secretary general of the European Renewable Gas Registry (ERGaR), spoke about the current challenges and opportunities in certifying and trading biomethane and biogenic carbon dioxide (bio-CO2) across Europe.

He highlighted the fragmented certification landscape that currently exists, with different frameworks depending on the gas’s source and end use – such as carbon removal, renewable energy directives or voluntary markets – which complicates cross-border trade and risks double counting.

Hamers stressed that certification is a key part of the solution to unlocking the market for bio-CO2 and biomethane, gases produced from biogas plants and bio-refineries with diverse applications ranging from beverage carbonation to fuels and greenhouse use. The complexity increases due to multiple use cases and varying certification requirements, often resulting in additional administrative burden without added benefit.

ERGaR advocates for a harmonised, single certification system that would streamline processes, prevent double counting and provide clarity and trust for producers, buyers and regulators. He explained ongoing efforts to connect Guarantees of Origin registries with the European Union’s central database, aiming to improve transparency and ease market operations.

Hamers also discussed regulatory developments, including incentives and certification rules for aviation fuels and the importance of upcoming delegated acts expected to clarify these frameworks. He emphasised the importance of harmonisation and registry integration as critical steps towards enabling a more efficient and credible market for renewable gases in Europe.

Optimising carbon intensity

Roland Kok, founder of Route to Market, highlighted that many biogas producers make avoidable mistakes during on-site biogas or biomethane production, but these can be transformed into valuable optimisations.

A key area is the use of disaggregated feedstock meeting regulatory standards (MERs), including dry or processed manures such as chicken manure or thick fractions of cattle manure. Optimising transport values – especially for feedstock with low dry matter content – can significantly improve efficiency and carbon intensity. Properly aggregating and using actual measured values of feedstock quality often yields better results than default values.

Kok pointed out that emissions estimates from biogas processing and upgrading are often overly conservative. By using actual methane emission measurements, producers can lower carbon intensity and increase compliance benefits.

Additionally, biogas production bonuses – around 25 cubic metres of biogas per tonne of manure – can be claimed if yields exceed this benchmark.

Interestingly, sourcing feedstock from farther distances is allowed when regulations are followed and auditors informed, offering strategic flexibility. Stable feedstock supply is essential for investor confidence, and thoughtful feedstock allocation can optimise carbon scores.

Administrative optimisations include reducing methane leaks, applying lower emission factors where justified and improving transport fuels like HVO. Increasing dry matter content or capturing C2 gases can improve carbon intensity but may increase operational costs.

Kok also stressed careful management of CO2 capture credits, as environmental attributes cannot be double-counted. Overall, he noted that optimising carbon intensity goes beyond regulatory compliance – it’s a strategic imperative to create value and competitiveness in evolving carbon markets. Producers must engage smartly with carbon intensity metrics to thrive in future biogas sectors.

The growing role of private equity

Khash Mohajerani, co-founder and partner at OrbeNovo Capital, outlined the appeal and challenges of private equity investment in the biogas sector, particularly across Western Europe. OrbeNovo specialises in energy investments and currently manages an £80 million capital investment in the UK biogas platform EAG Bio Energy.

Mohajerani highlighted biogas as a compelling sector due to its unique ability to provide modular, clean energy that complements intermittent renewables like wind and solar. He pointed out the strong EU policy support targeting a 10-fold increase in biogas production by 2030, alongside a focus on domestic energy security – advantages that attract private equity interest.

The sector is evolving from a fragmented landscape of small, farm-based operations to larger, professionalised platforms that can deliver scalable, cash-generative businesses. Private equity firms prioritise investing in experienced management teams with proven track records, favouring platform-building over one-off asset purchases.

Feedstock price stability and a clear regulatory environment are vital, though Mohajerani warned about the practical limits of long-term feedstock contracts with farmers.

Business models vary from lower-risk acquisitions of operating assets – yielding 11-14% returns – to greenfield development projects with higher capital but similar returns. The sector’s complexity, including risks around feedstock, operational efficiency and permitting delays, demands careful risk mitigation.

EAG Bio Energy exemplifies value creation through strategic acquisitions and converting biogas electricity plants into higher value biomethane facilities, benefiting from attractive market prices. Ancillary revenues from heat, digestate and CO₂ represent additional growth opportunities.

Looking ahead, Mohajerani said he expects accelerated consolidation and industrialisation of the biogas industry, alongside increased corporate partnerships. He highlighted the need for long-term policy certainty and streamlined permitting processes to attract the estimated $80-100 billion capital investment necessary to meet Europe’s ambitious 2030 targets.

ST1BioKraft’s market navigation

Miika Johansson, CEO of St1Biokraft, shared insights into the company’s ambitious growth and operational strategy in the bio-based energy sector. St1Biokraft is currently navigating a challenging supply-demand balance, selling over twice its own production volume by sourcing biomass from various suppliers, including local creek feedstocks.

Diederichs highlighted that Europe leads global biogas production, accounting for about 50%, with significant contributions also coming from the US, China and Brazil. Currently, approximately 45% of biogas is used in the transport sector, which is the main driver of demand worldwide.

In the US, half of biogas is upgraded to biomethane, mainly sourced from landfill gas. Early introduction of certification schemes and supportive legislation helped establish a strong market. California is aiming for full electrification of the transport sector by 2035, reserving biomethane for heavy industry applications.

China’s biogas market differs markedly, with a historically high share of raw biogas from household digesters, now shifting toward industrial production with ambitious expansion goals.

Brazil, leveraging its large ethanol industry, is expanding biomethane production by using ethanol by-products, supported by recent blending mandates.

India, although a smaller player now, shows huge potential due to its pollution challenges and policy incentives targeting a sevenfold production increase by 2035.

Europe is experiencing rapid growth in biomethane, doubling production from 6 to 12 BCM between 2023 and 2024. Diederichs emphasised that new European plants are increasingly residue- and waste-based rather than reliant on energy crops, reflecting environmental priorities.

Complex policy frameworks combining supply-side incentives and demand-side obligations are driving this growth, with EU-wide regulations like the Renewable Energy Directive and EU ETS playing major roles.

Diederichs also noted recent regulatory shifts, such as Germany’s plan to end double counting of waste-based biomethane, which immediately affected market dynamics. She stressed the importance of active policy engagement to sustain industry growth.

The presentation concluded with an outlook on the vital role of biomethane in decarbonisation and the strong influence of evolving policies worldwide.

The maritime market

Tatiana Shakhova, originator biomethane and BioLNG at Varo Energy, spoke about biomethane supply pathways and their significance for the maritime fuel market. With extensive experience in biomethane trading and storage, Shakhova highlighted Varo Energy’s strong presence in downstream distribution across Europe, including terminals in the Benelux, Germany, France and Switzerland.

Shakhova outlined three primary biomethane production pathways: on-site physical liquefaction, grid injection followed by terminal liquefaction and the innovative virtual terminal liquefaction.

The first two methods face constraints in storage capacity and scale, limiting economic viability. Virtual liquefaction, however, offers greater scale and flexibility by reversing gas flows from the grid back into LNG terminals, leveraging existing infrastructure for maritime biofuel supply.

Varo Energy’s biomethane production plant currently generates 400 GWh annually, with expansion plans targeting 650 GWh. Shakhova outlined the growing maritime demand driven by stringent emissions regulations and the economic competitiveness of biomethane relative to alternatives such as hydrogen or ammonia.

Biomethane reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 60% compared to conventional LNG and aligns well with upcoming FuelEU Maritime regulations.

Despite rapid market growth, supply limitations persist. Shakhova pointed out that European biomethane liquefaction capacity is insufficient to meet future maritime demand fully, highlighting the necessity for additional terminal capacity. She concluded that biomethane is a promising, scalable decarbonisation fuel for shipping, with diverse production and supply pathways tailored to different market needs and operational challenges.

Attracting funding in the biogas sector

Christian Cuenot, independent consultant at Blue Biogas, examined how to secure funding for biogas projects amid a challenging market environment. Drawing on his extensive expertise, Cuenot outlined practical strategies and key considerations for developers aiming to attract investment in 2024 and beyond.

Cuenot emphasised the importance of a well-structured approach involving six critical steps: developing a robust business case, understanding investor profiles, ensuring technical feasibility, navigating permitting processes, building strong partnerships and delivering compelling pitches. He stressed that demonstrating clear project profitability and transparently managing risks are essential to meet investor expectations.

He noted that, although the biogas sector faces pressures such as market volatility and regulatory shifts, it remains a compelling opportunity due to its competitive costs and significant carbon reduction potential. Cuenot highlighted support from organisations like the International Energy Agency, which underscores the sector’s long-term growth prospects despite short-term challenges.

The presentation categorised investors into impact investors seeking higher-risk, higher-return projects; development banks focused on strategic sustainability goals; and private equity or infrastructure funds preferring stable, lower-risk investments. Understanding these distinct investor motivations helps tailor project proposals effectively.

Cuenot also discussed common risks at various project stages, including feasibility, public acceptance, construction and operation, advising developers to engage stakeholders proactively and secure stable revenue streams through mechanisms like subsidies and long-term contracts.

Concluding, Cuenot urged biogas developers to adopt comprehensive risk management and strategic planning to enhance project attractiveness and successfully secure funding in a competitive landscape.",https://www.bioenergy-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/JR_Biofuels-39-768x512.jpg,N,,2025-07-22 13:07:45.219443

Starting this year, the European Union and the U.K. require jet fuel to include at least 2% SAF.
(When including cargo carriers, DHL Group led the world by using SAF for 3.52% of its jet fuel last year.)
This could include levies on frequent fliers or carbon taxes on jet fuel.","British Airways’ parent company, International Airlines Group, surged ahead of other passenger airlines last year to consume the most sustainable aviation fuel, according to a Bloomberg Green review of corporate filings from dozens of air carriers.

The company acquired 55 million gallons of cleaner jet fuel, which is derived from lower-emitting sources such as used cooking oil and animal tallow. That number exceeded the amount used by all U.S. passenger airlines combined.

But the promising performance is overshadowed by a troubling reality for the industry: The shift to sustainable aviation fuel is still minuscule, while growth in passenger air travel is drowning out any climate gains so far. For example, despite IAG’s world-leading status, cleaner fuel accounted for only about 1.9% of its overall fuel consumption last year, and its emissions from fuel combustion still rose by 5%.

Globally, sustainable aviation fuel is expected to increase to 0.7% from 0.3% of aviation fuel this year. But the International Air Transport Assn. expects air travel to climb 6%, causing another jump in emissions.

“We’re still at the very beginning of this market,” said Daisy Robinson, a BloombergNEF analyst who focuses on renewable fuels. “It’s going to take some time.”

New rules are springing up in different parts of the world to spur more use of sustainable aviation fuel, which costs at least twice as much as conventional jet fuel. Starting this year, the European Union and the U.K. require jet fuel to include at least 2% SAF. Other requirements have been enacted or planned in Canada’s British Columbia province, Brazil, Indonesia and Singapore.

Such rules help protect first movers from being undercut on prices by competitors. “As airlines, because of competition, we’re not great at doing this voluntarily,” said Aaron Robinson, IAG’s vice president for sustainable aviation fuels in the U.S. “Mandates in different geographies can play a really important role in moving the whole aviation industry forward.”

In the U.S., where no mandates are planned and where President Trump’s recent tax bill reduced incentives for SAF, airlines have fallen behind the market leaders — despite some heavily advertising their pursuit of greener fuels.

Alaska Air Group Inc. leaped to the front of U.S. carriers last year by increasing its SAF usage more than tenfold to 0.68% of its fuel. That’s about double the percentage of several other big U.S. airlines, including JetBlue Airways Corp., United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. It’s nearly 10 times the percentage of American Airlines Group Inc., which used only 0.07% SAF. (When including cargo carriers, DHL Group led the world by using SAF for 3.52% of its jet fuel last year.)

Businesses that spend a lot on corporate travel, such as tech firms and consulting companies, helped pay for more than half of Alaska’s SAF last year. This enables companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Autodesk Inc. to claim a smaller carbon footprint. Microsoft shaved its emissions by 65,000 tons last year by helping cover the cost of greener fuels, including for some employee flights on Alaska.

It’s unclear, though, how many more companies will step up, especially given the high cost of cleaner jet fuel compared with other options to rein in emissions. Ryan Spies, managing director of sustainability for Alaska, estimates that businesses pay $150 to $300 for each ton of carbon dioxide that they avoid through SAF purchases. By comparison, carbon offsets sold for an average of about $6.30 per ton last year, according to Ecosystem Marketplace — though many offset projects have delivered fewer climate benefits than advertised.

“This pool might not be that deep,” Spies said. “The only way to bring these [cost] numbers down is to invest in these technologies.”

Global SAF production continues to lurch forward at an uneven clip. Although analysts say there’s plenty of green fuel to hit the 2% mandates in Europe this year, vastly more will be needed for airlines to reach their widely held goals of 10% SAF by 2030.

A couple of new plants began churning out cleaner fuels last year, including a large Texas facility from Diamond Green Diesel, which is a joint venture between Valero Energy Corp. and Darling Ingredients Inc. Meanwhile, World Energy’s first-in-the-country SAF plant in Paramount, has been shut down for months after the loss of financial backing from Air Products & Chemicals Inc. A World Energy spokesperson said there’s no timetable for restarting the plant.

Perhaps the biggest disappointment for airlines has been the retreat of oil giants, which previously trumpeted massive commitments in this area. BP, for instance, said two years ago that it was pursuing five projects around the world that would produce 50,000 barrels of renewable fuels per day, with a focus on SAF. The oil major has since scaled back most of these plans amid a renewed focus on fossil fuels. BP didn’t respond to requests for comment.

“We need to make sure that some of these bigger players are really investing in the new facilities,” said Hemant Mistry, director of net zero transition for the International Air Transport Assn. “They’re the ones who have the technical expertise, the experience, and they have the balance sheets, as well.”

Passenger air travel is expected to double by 2050, which will probably cause emissions to soar. While airlines are counting heavily on cleaner fuels to save the day — IATA anticipates SAF could be 80% to 90% of the fuel supply by mid-century — others are more pessimistic. BloombergNEF, for instance, predicts that scarce feedstocks and a lack of new plants will limit these cleaner fuels to about 7% of the industry’s propellant by 2050.

Considering these challenges, some in the industry are pushing it to shift its focus beyond SAF and to address the thorny issue of ever-rising passenger numbers. “Limiting or even questioning growth, that is difficult for airlines,” said Karel Bockstael, a former vice president of sustainability at KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, who retired in 2022 after 32 years at the company.

Bockstael last year co-founded the group Call Aviation to Action, which has the support of more than 400 current and former aviation insiders, including from fuel producers, airports and airlines. They’re urging the industry to set firm limits for its emissions and to support more aggressive policies to stay within these boundaries. This could include levies on frequent fliers or carbon taxes on jet fuel.

“We’re not against the industry, we love it, we know all the benefits of it,” Bockstael said. “But if we do not have a strategy — if we do not have a way out when planetary boundaries are forced upon us — then we will have serious problems, and our industry will have a tragic hard landing.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fc9f92e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x1890+0+256/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb2%2F24%2F02f51a5c4a7ea22e9e892e9afb71%2F1431789-la-me-lax-superbloom-1-brv.jpg,N,,2025-07-22 13:07:49.295597

Funding from Department for Transport to advance two commercial-scale plants in the UK

LONDON, July 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LanzaTech Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: LNZA) (“LanzaTech” or the “Company”) a leader in carbon management solutions, announced it has received a grant of £6.4 million from the UK government's Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF), operated by the Department for Transport (DfT).

The grant will accelerate the development of LanzaTech’s innovative DRAGON 1 & 2 projects, each playing a crucial role in the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the UK. Project DRAGON stands for Decarbonizing and Reimagining Aviation for the Goal Of Netzero.

The DRAGON 1 project is LanzaTech’s existing UK SAF project that will convert recycled carbon fuel ethanol (including ethanol from LanzaTech’s gas fermentation process) into Advanced SAF in Port Talbot, South Wales, using the LanzaJet® Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) process.

The DRAGON 2 project is a Power-to-Liquid (PtL) facility that will convert waste carbon dioxide and green hydrogen into ethanol for subsequent conversion into PtL SAF at an adjacent facility using the LanzaJet® Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) process. The location for DRAGON 2 in the UK will be determined during this grant-funded project.

Integrating LanzaTech’s gas fermentation process with LanzaJet’s AtJ technology gives this approach a distinctive edge. By turning regional waste resources into valuable SAF, LanzaTech facilitates the production of low Carbon Intensity (CI) fuels, contributing positively to the UK’s SAF Mandate and supporting economic growth and job creation in industrial zones in the UK.

The collaboration's key focus is on interoperability to enhance data integrity, mitigate double issuance risks, and facilitate efficient cross-registry SAF certificate handling between commercial and business aviation.

The collaboration between the CADO SAF Registry and the Assure SAF Registry powered by 4AIR is a key step towards a fully functioning SAF market while safeguarding data integrity.

""Collaboration can leverage the strengths of each sector to tackle the challenge of decarbonizing the aviation industry more effectively. Alignment between commercial and business aviation sends a strong demand signal for more SAF, creates greater transparency, reduces integrity risks for the SAF value chain, and eases the burden of claiming SAF under voluntary or regulatory schemes,"" said Kennedy Ricci, President of 4AIR.

""A unified approach from both business and commercial aviation is vital to create an environment that promotes SAF development and adoption across sectors. This can only be achieved when all registry providers work together and cooperate on the technical aspects of interoperability, to ensure immutable tracking of emission reductions, in a harmonized and standardized way. This should lead to greater acceptance and demand for SAF, potentially lowering the costs and administrative burden for procuring SAF and claiming its environmental attributes under voluntary or regulatory schemes,"" said Michael Schneider, Executive Director, CADO.

This collaboration with 4AIR follows the announcement of a similar collaboration agreement with 123Carbon to develop interoperability between SAF registries.

About CADO

The Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO) was established in March 2025 to maintain and operate the IATA-developed SAF Registry. It is a not-for-profit organization incorporated under Canadian Law with its headquarters in Montreal.

CADO's founding member is the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

About the CADO SAF Registry

The CADO SAF Registry (SAF Registry), originally developed by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) is now owned and operated by CADO. IATA currently continues to provide ongoing technical and operational support for the SAF Registry.

The SAF Registry is a global system to record SAF transactions in a standardized and transparent way.

Gevo Inc. is pleased to announce that it is selling carbon abatement into the market for the first time. To support decarbonization and to mitigate its corporate travel emissions, the buyer, a global financial and technology company, purchased high-integrity durable carbon removal credits, known as CORCs (or CO2 Removal Certificates), that are Puro.earth-certified and are ready to retire immediately. CORCs provide true carbon abatement, with a volume of actual carbon dioxide permanently removed from circulation, which offsets the effect of emissions.

Selling high-integrity CORCs is core to Gevo’s strategy, with the rapidly expanding demand for high-quality carbon credits presenting a real market opportunity today.

The Gevo North Dakota facility has the appropriate geological formation and operational Class VI well for CCS, with a total estimated sequestration capacity of up to 1 million metric tons of CO2 per year. This site can supply customers with CORCs today that are ready to be retired immediately. The supply of credits is certified by Puro.earth under its strict standards for 1,000-plus-years permanence and other key quality parameters required by customers. CCS is a key part of our decarbonization strategy for sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”) as we develop production on multiple pathways.

CO2 is a product that is often used in industrial applications, including the food and beverage industry or the petroleum production industry through enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Alternatively, CO2 can have value by being captured and permanently stored, in lieu of being emitted to the atmosphere. At Gevo North Dakota, biogenic CO₂ is captured and securely stored underground—enabling the generation of the CORCs.

“These are real sales of credits for carbon dioxide removal that are being generated right now,” says Alex Clayton, chief business development officer for Gevo. “Customers should feel confident in the CORCs we provide due to the rigor Gevo and Puro.earth are putting into every step of the process. We previously said that after our purchase of Gevo North Dakota that we would be selling carbon and that’s what we’re doing.”

“Gevo is demonstrating that durable carbon removal isn’t some distant solution—it’s available now,” said Trenton Spindler, chief growth officer at Puro.earth. “With Puro-certified CORCs, buyers worldwide can act decisively to tackle their toughest emissions with confidence in real, permanent results.”

This pathway could enable cost-competitive SAF production, offering operational flexibility while also decarbonising industrial appliances.
Sustainable Aviation Fuel is essential to reducing emissions from the aviation industry and through this project we are taking a major step toward scaling up SAF production right here in the UK.
The University of Sheffield is one of the world’s leading universities for sustainable aviation fuel R&D.
Sheffield was part of a consortium that delivered the world’s first transatlantic flight powered by sustainable aviation fuel.","The University of Sheffield has been awarded UK government funding to accelerate the production of sustainable aviation fuel and bring passengers a step closer to greener flights.

Announced by the Aviation Minister, Mike Kane MP, during a visit to the University (Monday 21 July), Sheffield will lead a £1.5 million project to commercialise its new SAF production technology and attract investors to build SAF production plants in order to boost the supply of the cleaner fuel to the aviation industry.

The project will be delivered by a consortium, including Fuel Cell Energy (US), Green Lizard Technologies (UK), Drax Power (UK), IMI Vivo (Italy), Gardner Consulting (UK), and Leeds Bradford Airport (UK), and received letters of support from Airbus, Boeing, City of Doncaster Council and Qatar Airways.

SAF is typically produced using bio or waste feedstock. However, there are concerns over whether a sufficient level of feedstock is possible to establish and maintain. The University of Sheffield’s new production pathway eliminates this reliance as it can produce SAF using a combination of renewable energy sources and next generation carbon capture technology.

The pathway is called Power to Liquid (PtL). It uses renewable electricity to produce hydrogen and captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or industrial processes. The hydrogen and CO2 are then combined to create synthetic hydrocarbons, which can be refined into SAF.

This pathway could enable cost-competitive SAF production, offering operational flexibility while also decarbonising industrial appliances.

The Sheffield-led project, called NextGen-SAF, aims to build a world first demonstration plant combining two innovative technologies to produce SAF - a Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) and an Advance Fischer-Tropsch (AFT) reactor. The fuel cell can generate hydrogen and capture CO2 and the reactor converts the mixture into the synthetic hydrocarbons that are then refined into SAF. The plant will demonstrate the operability, reliability and performance of the integrated system so the method can be scaled up.

Professor Koen Lamberts, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sheffield, said: “We are proud to lead this project, made possible by this vital funding, to develop a new and innovative SAF production pathway. Sustainable Aviation Fuel is essential to reducing emissions from the aviation industry and through this project we are taking a major step toward scaling up SAF production right here in the UK. This initiative not only advances the UK’s goals around SAF but also strengthens the nation’s fuel production capabilities and will deliver lasting economic benefits.”

Announcing £63 million of funding for 17 projects to accelerate SAF production, Aviation Minister Mike Kane said: ""This £63 million is lift-off for Britain's green aviation revolution. We're not just backing brilliant British innovation, we're creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market.

""From the labs of Sheffield to the runways of the future – this is how we kickstart economic growth, secure energy independence, and make Britain a clean energy superpower.""

The University of Sheffield is one of the world’s leading universities for sustainable aviation fuel R&D. Its Energy Innovation Centre is home to some of the most advanced clean energy research facilities in Europe, which include pilot scale testing facilities that enable academics and businesses to collaborate to test new clean energy technologies, including sustainable aviation fuel, before scaling up and commercialising.

The University hosts the UK SAF Clearing House - one of only two centres in the world - that support fuel producers in obtaining the certification needed for use in the aviation industry.

Sheffield was part of a consortium that delivered the world’s first transatlantic flight powered by sustainable aviation fuel. Researchers from the University analysed the impact of SAF on the flight’s particulate emissions and contrail formation using the unique SAF research facilities at the Energy Innovation Centre. The results demonstrated up to a 70 per cent reduction in emission levels.",https://sheffield.ac.uk/sites/default/files/styles/two_thirds_2x/public/2024-04/GettyImages-1414599949.jpg?h=34c9d013&itok=5EXxCYpa,N,,2025-07-22 09:20:11.324153

Event travel and reliance on single-use plastics, such as water bottles and snack packaging, compound these challenges. The emissions from fans and artists traveling to each venue contribute significantly to the carbon footprint.

Coldplay is actively working to counteract this impact during its most current tour, with a focus on raising fans' environmental awareness and reducing its own emissions significantly.

Innovative approaches to emission reduction

In its commitment to reducing environmental impact, Coldplay has decreased its carbon emissions by more than 50% through implementing more sustainable practices such as energy reduction and extensive recycling initiatives. The band aims to offset more CO₂ than produced by the tour through funding projects focused on environmental rehabilitation and innovation. These initiatives include:

Reforestation

Rewilding

Conservation

Soil regeneration

Carbon capture and storage

Furthermore, Coldplay seeks guidance from the Oxford Principles for net zero aligned carbon offsetting to address unavoidable emissions. Partnering with notable firms like DHL, a leader in sustainable logistics solutions, enhances their efforts to lower emissions from transportation and other logistics-related environmental impacts.

Renewable energy at concerts

Partnering with BMW, Coldplay developed the first rechargeable show battery, leveraging recycled BMW i3 batteries to power concerts entirely with renewable energy.

The setup includes solar photovoltaic panels installed backstage to charge the batteries prior to each show. The tour also features innovative energy sources, such as kinetic floors installed around stadiums, where energy from fans' movements contributes to powering the performance.

The band relies on renewable diesel made from hydrotreated vegetable oil, further reducing the tour's carbon footprint. Each aspect of the concert is carefully designed with sustainability in mind, incorporating stages built from lightweight, low-carbon, and reusable materials, such as recycled steel. LED wristbands distributed to audiences are compostable and reused to minimize production waste.

DHL's contribution to emissions management

DHL has played a crucial role in reducing Coldplay's tour emissions by deploying a carbon intelligence and monitoring system. This system provides an in-depth analysis of the tour's carbon footprint, allowing for targeted optimization operations. Findings revealed that a significant portion (over 80%) of CO₂ emissions stemmed from air transport of equipment.

To address this, DHL developed the GoGreen Plus initiative. This program utilises carbon insetting, enabling customers to reduce emissions directly at the source. For instance, enabling air freight carriers for the tour to purchase Sustainable Aviation Fuel, which provides an 85% reduction in the fuel life-cycle per flight.

Coldplay released a statement saying: “We’re happy to report that direct CO₂ emissions from the first two years of this tour are 59% less than our previous stadium tour (2016-17), on a show-by-show comparison. These figures have been verified by the MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative.

“We’d like to say a huge thank you to our incredible touring family and to all the brilliant people who’ve made this possible.

“Most of all, we’d like to thank everyone who’s come to a show and helped charge the show batteries on the power bikes and kinetic dance floors; everyone who’s arrived by foot, bike, ride share or public transport; everyone who’s come with refillable water bottles or returned their LED wristband for recycling; and everyone who’s bought a ticket, which means you’ve planted one of 7 million trees so far.

“As a band, and as an industry, we’re a long way from where we need to be on this. But we’re grateful for everyone’s help so far, and we salute everyone who’s making efforts to push things in the right direction.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/7b11db6b3b46080208ce3cc36544ea4d:3278373b211bc8560586385c0e4b4912/coldplay-main.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-22 09:20:45.276099

The funding aims to support 1,400 jobs and secure Britain’s position as the “global leader in the green aviation market”, the government said, which was “critical to provide the clean fuel that’s essential to realise sustainable growth in the aviation sector”.

It means the UK Government has now invested £198m to-date the Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF) to scale up cleaner aviation technologies.

The AFF winners include a range of companies and are spread across the country, such as OXCCU Tech who are developing a demonstration plant at Oxford Airport, to LanzaJet who are building a commercial-scale plant in south Wales.

Low carbon fuel production could add up to £5 billion to the economy by 2050. SAF is an alternative to fossil jet fuel which reduces greenhouse gas emissions on average by 70% on a lifecycle basis, from feedstock to biofuel.

The SAF Bill will help secure the future of the aviation sector, by boosting green fuel production in the UK and delivering cleaner flights. The bill also aims to give investors the confidence to back sustainable aviation fuel production, grow the sector, providing good green jobs, and enabling the delivery of carbon savings.

Aviation Minister Mike Kane said:

“This £63 million is lift off for Britain’s green aviation revolution. We’re not just backing brilliant British innovation, we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market.

“From the labs of Sheffield to the runways of the future – this is how we kickstart economic growth, secure energy independence, and make Britain a clean energy superpower.”

Professor Mohamed Pourkashanian, Managing Director of the University of Sheffield’s Energy Innovation Centre, who is leading the project, said:

“It is fantastic to see the University of Sheffield playing a leading role in the development of sustainable aviation fuel and supporting the aviation industry in its efforts to reduce its emissions.

“At Sheffield we have some of the most advanced SAF research facilities in Europe and are excited to work with partners from the industry to help them test and develop new fuels and next generation clean energy technologies.”

Andrew Symes, CEO and Co-Founder of OXCCU, said:

“Support from the Advanced Fuels Fund is a key step in scaling our technology. This funding enables the detailed design and construction of OX2, our demonstration plant launching in 2026, and builds on the successful delivery of OX1. It brings us closer to producing lower-cost, lower-carbon aviation fuel and supports the UK’s ambition to become a global leader in SAF production.”

Jimmy Samartzis, Chief Executive Officer, LanzaJet, said:

“We’re proud that Project Speedbird, developed in partnership with British Airways, has been recognised by the Department for Transport as part of its continued commitment to advancing SAF in the UK.

“This support demonstrates confidence in LanzaJet’s technology and the critical role ethanol-to-SAF can play in delivering economic growth, creating jobs, and decarbonising air travel. Project Speedbird is vital to building a national SAF industry in the UK and to unlocking opportunity and innovation in the region. We thank the DfT for its leadership and vision in accelerating the transition to net-zero aviation.”

In addition to this immediate focus, Airbus is also investing in future technologies. “We’re exploring various innovative solutions,” said Burger. “As a notable example,we’re enhancing wing designs for better aerodynamics.” New engine technology developments are also underway.

“By the end of this decade, we plan to have an open rotor demonstrator flying,” he added enthusiastically. “Our aim is to refine these technologies so that they can be implemented effectively down the line.”

Sustainable aviation Fuel challenges

However, technology alone won’t solve everything; SAF remains one of the most practical options available right now for cutting emissions from existing fleets.While Burger emphasized how using drop-in SAF could make a difference quickly, he also pointed out supply challenges.

Apart from its own operations influencing industry standards and practices regarding SAF production and usage rates—Burger mentioned that understanding these challenges allows them to collaborate effectively with airlines and regulatory bodies: “We want production levels of SAF aligned with industry needs as we strive toward net-zero goals by 2050.”

The BelugaXL fleet serves as both operational support and testing ground for blending fuels—a move that positions Airbus as what Burger calls a “catalyst” within this transition:

“We see ourselves facilitating higher quantities of SAF usage across our operations.”

Circular Economy Considerations

While operational activities contribute significantly—around 95%—to overall aircraft emissions during their lifecycle according to Burger’s insights; there’s also an increasing emphasis on sustainability throughout each phase including end-of-life processes.

“We’re heavily invested in recycling initiatives,” he remarked proudly about their joint venture Tarmac which operates facilities across Spain, France and China capable of recycling over 90% weight from decommissioned aircraft.

This capability strengthens arguments favoring newer models’ long-term sustainability especially considering future market dynamics where environmental performance may directly impact asset values or leasing conditions.

Taking Action Now

The takeaway from Airbus? Immediate action hinges upon replacing old fleets alongside integrating more sustainable fuels—not waiting around for groundbreaking innovations.

“Combining advancements like SAF adoption within current fleets contributes significantly towards achieving over 80 percent reduction targets set forth by industry stakeholders today—and moving forward,” asserted Burger.

Yet realizing this vision relies not only upon manufacturers’ capabilities but equally upon regulators’, producers’, operators’ willingness—or ability—to embrace change amidst financial pressures coupled with supply limitations along technical hurdles ahead.",https://fullavantenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/92742-airbus-pushes-next-gen-freighter-as-route-to-net-zero.jpg,N,,2025-07-22 09:21:41.087054

The cash will be shared by 17 British companies developing different types of ""sustainable aviation fuel"" (SAF), made from materials including forest cuttings, household rubbish, sugar beet or hydrogen gas.

Ministers said the funds could support 1,400 jobs, add £5bn to the economy and help the British industry get ahead as global demand for SAF soars in order to meet stricter climate targets.

They warn the materials needed for sustainable fuels are hard to come by and too expensive to ever scale up.

Industry says it needs this cash injection precisely in order to lower costs and grow, and global demand is booming.

As of January, flights taking off from the UK must use 2% SAF in their fuel, under new government rules. This will gradually rise to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040.

But there have been alarm bells warning not enough SAF will be available to meet those targets.

The government says sustainable fuels cut emissions of greenhouse gases by 70% on average compared with kerosene over the course of its life, which includes producing it and burning it.

Aviation minister Mike Kane said: ""We're not just backing brilliant British innovation, we're creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market.""

He said the move would ""kickstart economic growth, secure energy independence, and make Britain a clean energy superpower"".

But campaigners say at best the fuels will reduce aviation emissions ""by a tiny fraction of the amount needed"", and are being used to justify ""irresponsible levels"" of airport expansion.

James Sutton, co-director of climate charity Possible, told Sky News they were not anti-investment, but that the SAF plans would not bring down emissions at the pace and scale necessary.

He said: ""We need to cut those emissions immediately if we have any hope of hitting our climate goals, not just sit and hope for the best in a few decades time.

""The technology and investment required for SAF to displace kerosene entirely is simply not there yet, but policies aimed at reducing demand for flights and taxing frequent flyers, which will therefore cut emissions, are possible now.

""So that is what we need to focus on first and foremost.""

“By supplying both conventional and renewable fuels for Talisman Sabre 2025, we’re helping to unlock a different type of capability for Defence and facilitating solutions which shore up energy security whilst supporting the energy transition,” he said.

“Together with the ADF and our international partners, we’re very proud to take this important step with sustainability during such a large and significant exercise.”

As Exercise Talisman Sabre 2025 (TS25) ramps up across Australia, the skies above Queensland have marked a new milestone in Defence’s commitment to cleaner energy with the use of SAF.

Australian and UK partners trialled the fuel technology on a special VIP flight.

SAF is a certified ‘drop-in’ fuel used in both military and civilian aviation around the world. It is made from renewable feedstocks like used cooking oil, waste fats, and plant oils.

When blended with fossil-derived fuel in accordance with international standards, It requires no modifications to aircraft or fuel infrastructure and has the potential to reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to fossil-derived fuel.

The SAF used on this mission, fuelled a 33 Squadron MRTT aircraft at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, ahead of a TS25 mission.

“Exercises like Talisman Sabre give us a perfect opportunity to work with industry and international partners to trial next-generational fuels in ways that support capability and climate resilience,” said Brigadier Baldock.

“We are building upon our current fuel system to ensure that it is fit for the future. We are doing it in lockstep with our industry partners, our international allies, and our own people on the ground and in the air.”

Flight Lieutenant Michael Que Hee, a pilot at 33 Squadron flying the mission, said that from a user perspective the switch to SAF was seamless.

“From the cockpit, there’s no difference, the aircraft flies exactly the same,” Flight Lieutenant Que Hee said.

“Knowing we are helping to enhance the fuel supply chain and reducing emissions just by doing our job makes it even more rewarding.”

Aircraft technician Leading Aircraftman Tikiri Lamb involved in the VIP flight preparation, echoed the same sentiment from the tarmac.

“With the same equipment and process, it’s just like refuelling with standard aviation fuel,” Leading Aircraftman Lamb said.

“It’s great knowing we are contributing to something bigger, while still doing our job the same way we always do.”

Defence’s use of SAF reflects key objectives outlined in the 2024 National Defence Strategy, the Defence Net Zero Strategy, and the Defence Future Energy Strategy, driving greater energy independence, climate responsibility, and fuel security.

Vivergo’s parent company Associated British Foods (ABF) opened a 45-day redundancy consultation period for its 160 staff members 20 days ago, following repeated warnings from the company that UK bioethanol manufacturing will become commercially unsustainable once the US-UK trade deal comes into force.
The statement stressed that bioethanol producers are not demanding an “infinite subsidy” but rather “targeted action” to help grow UK demand for bioethanol.
Hackett believes increasing this to 15% will both reduce emissions further and help rescue the bioethanol industry.

Vivergo’s parent company Associated British Foods (ABF) opened a 45-day redundancy consultation period for its 160 staff members 20 days ago, following repeated warnings from the company that UK bioethanol manufacturing will become commercially unsustainable once the US-UK trade deal comes into force. The deal, agreed in May, will remove the existing 19% tariffs on US bioethanol imported into the UK up to a threshold of 1.4bn L – far more than the 820m L produced each year at the country’s two main plants, with Teesside-based Ensus also facing closure.

Vivergo has warned that without government intervention, British bioethanol producers will be unable to compete with cheap American imports which are heavily subsidised by the US government. The company suspended purchases of wheat feedstock, largely sourced from British farms, in early June, and currently plans to cease all production by 13 September if it does not receive commitment of government support by the end of the consultation period.

Industry unity

The statement, issued today following a gathering at the Saltend Chemicals Park in Hull last week, was signed by Vivergo managing director Ben Hackett along with seven other senior industry figures based at Saltend, including the site manager of Ineos’ acetic acid plant Rob Fergie. The statement stressed that bioethanol producers are not demanding an “infinite subsidy” but rather “targeted action” to help grow UK demand for bioethanol.

The primary use of bioethanol in the UK is as an additive in petrol to lower exhaust emissions, currently forming 10% of standard grade unleaded petrol, or “E10”. Hackett believes increasing this to 15% will both reduce emissions further and help rescue the bioethanol industry.

The statement warned that support was needed to “prevent a key pillar of the Humber’s green industrial future from collapsing”, adding that the closure of Vivergo would drive up costs for other Saltend businesses.

Vivergo also wants regulations of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to change, which could become a key market for bioethanol. Current regulations are that SAF must be made from non-food biomass such as agricultural waste, deeming jet fuel produced from bioethanol made from “first generation” crops such as wheat ineligible to be classed as SAF. Vivergo has already signed a memorandum of understanding with Saltend-based green hydrogen maker Meld Energy to produce SAF, but the joint statement, signed by Meld CEO Chris Smith, warned this is “dependent on Vivergo’s survival”.

Calls to make it easier for bioethanol producers to enter the SAF market were made in parliament last week during a subcommittee hearing on the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill. Sophia Haywood, director of UK and EU government affairs at SAF manufacturer LanzaJet, told the committee she believed “SAF is a great opportunity for the challenge that the bioethanol sector is currently facing.”

Maintaining Saltend’s integrated model

Today’s joint statement said: “We are asking for swift, targeted action that gives domestic bioethanol a fair chance to compete and keeps Saltend’s integrated model intact…The government has an opportunity to show that it backs the UK’s chemicals, future fuels and bioeconomy sectors. We stand ready to work with ministers to secure Vivergo’s future and unlock the full potential of the Saltend cluster for the region and for the country.”

Last month, the government began negotiating possible options to support the industry and has contracted external consultants to evaluate business plans submitted by Vivergo and Ensus.

A government spokesperson said: “We recognise this is a concerning time for workers and their families which is why we entered into negotiations with the company on potential financial support last month.

“We will continue to take proactive steps to address the long-standing challenges the company faces and remain committed to working closely with them throughout this period to present a plan for a way forward that protects supply chains, jobs and livelihoods.”",https://www.thechemicalengineer.com/media/22628/vivergo-fermentation.jpg?width=960,N,,2025-07-21 19:57:13.447975

The UK SAF mandate requires that 2% of the UK’s total jet fuel demand be met by SAF in 2025, with the percentage increasing to 10% in 2030 and 22% by 2040.

To date, the Government has provided £198m through the Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF) to scale up cleaner aviation technologies, with today’s (22 July) £63m funding to be shared by 17 different projects.

More than a dozen rojects, including LanzaTech’s commercial-scale plant rollouts and the University of Sheffield’s demonstration plant for SAF production combined with carbon capture, will be supported by the latest funding allocation.

Aviation Minister Mike Kane said: “This £63m is lift off for Britain’s green aviation revolution. We’re not just backing brilliant British innovation, we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market.

“From the labs of Sheffield to the runways of the future – this is how we kickstart economic growth, secure energy independence, and make Britain a clean energy superpower.”

A total of 17 projects will share the £63m funding. SAF options supported include waste-derived fuels, green hydrogen, residue-derived fuels, and methanol-to-jet-fuel transformation.

The role of SAF

The Government is aiming to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from aviation by up to 6.3 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2040, with SAF expected to contribute significantly to this target. By 2030, the UK is expected to use 1.2 million tonnes of SAF annually, enough to fuel more than 3,000 global flights each year.

The SAF mandate is projected to add £1.8bn to the UK economy and create around 10,000 jobs. The 17 projects supported through the latest funding are projected to support around 1,400 jobs.

In May, the Government introduced a Revenue Certainty Mechanism (RCM) for producers to receive a fixed price for SAF. If the market price is lower, the Government will pay the difference. If it is higher, producers will return the extra profit.

Despite Government backing, SAFs continue to be debated. Demand is not yet ready to align with predicted supply, with many production projects faltering financially. And critics are increasingly questioning whether many current production methods actually deliver meaningful climate benefits across the fuel lifecycle.",https://edienetlive.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/full_42673.jpg,N,,2025-07-21 21:56:25.269128

The boost will support around 1,400 jobs and secure Britain’s position as the global leader in the green aviation market – critical to provide the clean fuel that’s essential to realise sustainable growth in the aviation sector.

Today’s investment means government has provided £198 million to date through the Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF) to scale up cleaner aviation technologies. Creating a clean aviation ecosystem will help power the next generation of airport infrastructure and capacity scale up, kickstarting economic growth and delivering the UK’s clean energy superpower ambitions to deliver on the Plan for Change.

Low carbon fuel production could add up to £5 billion to the economy by 2050, position the UK as a global hub for SAF production and enable the UK to go further and faster with expansion plans.

Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, said:

This £63 million is lift off for Britain’s green aviation revolution. We’re not just backing brilliant British innovation, we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market.

From the labs of Sheffield to the runways of the future – this is how we kickstart economic growth, secure energy independence and make Britain a clean energy superpower.

SAF is an alternative to fossil jet fuel which reduces greenhouse gas emissions on average by 70% on a lifecycle basis, from feedstock to biofuel, making it the key technology that will allow UK aviation to grow capacity while achieving net zero commitments.

The SAF Bill will help secure the future of the aviation sector by boosting green fuel production in the UK and delivering cleaner flights. This bill will give investors the confidence to back sustainable aviation fuel production. It will help grow the sector, providing good green jobs and enabling the delivery of carbon savings.

Announcing the new funding at the University of Sheffield’s Energy Innovation Centre – which just received £1.5 million in this latest round – the Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, saw firsthand the groundbreaking work on aircraft engine testbeds and revolutionary aviation fuels.

Professor Mohamed Pourkashanian, Managing Director of the University of Sheffield’s Energy Innovation Centre, who is leading the project, said:

It is fantastic to see the University of Sheffield playing a leading role in the development of sustainable aviation fuel and supporting the aviation industry in its efforts to reduce its emissions. At Sheffield, we have some of the most advanced SAF research facilities in Europe and are excited to work with partners from the industry to help them test and develop new fuels and next generation clean energy technologies.

The AFF winners include a range of companies and are spread across the country, such as OXCCU Tech, which is developing a demonstration plant at Oxford Airport, to LanzaJet, which is building a commercial-scale plant in Teesside.

Andrew Symes, CEO and Co-Founder of OXCCU, said:

Support from the Advanced Fuels Fund is a key step in scaling our technology. This funding enables the detailed design and construction of OX2, our demonstration plant launching in 2026, and builds on the successful delivery of OX1. It brings us closer to producing lower-cost, lower-carbon aviation fuel and supports the UK’s ambition to become a global leader in SAF production.

Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet, said:

We’re proud that Project Speedbird, developed in partnership with British Airways, has been recognised by the Department for Transport as part of its continued commitment to advancing SAF in the UK.

This support demonstrates confidence in LanzaJet’s technology and the critical role ethanol-to-SAF can play in delivering economic growth, creating jobs and decarbonising air travel. Project Speedbird is vital to building a national SAF industry in the UK and to unlocking opportunity and innovation in the region.
